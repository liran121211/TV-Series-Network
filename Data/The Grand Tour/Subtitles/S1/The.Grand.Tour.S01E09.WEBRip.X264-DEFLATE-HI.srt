00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,323
(CHEERING)

2
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:03,131
Thank you. Thank you.

3
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:05,599
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

4
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:09,770
(CHEERING CONTINUES)

5
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:19,147
Danke. Danke und willkommen
in der Grosse Tour

6
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:20,981
which this week
comes from Germany!

7
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:26,019
- (CHEERING)
- Ja. We're here. We're here.

8
00:01:26,154 --> 00:01:31,159
Specifically...
Specifically, we are
in the city of Stuttgart.

9
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:33,461
Except we nearly weren't.

10
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:36,564
Because one of your
local Green politicians

11
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,832
tried to ban us
from coming here.

12
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,469
I don't want to embarrass
the poor man on television.

13
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,837
So I've hidden his identity.

14
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,773
(LAUGHTER)

15
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,277
Yeah.

16
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,044
- Yeah.
- That's good.

17
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:54,448
That's appropriate.

18
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:57,185
I certainly don't want to
tell you his name.

19
00:01:57,185 --> 00:02:00,621
Which is... Andreas Kasdorf.

20
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:04,258
- Uh...
- (BOOING)

21
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,727
Not a popular man.
But you elected him.

22
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:10,198
Anyway, he says that
we'd be unwelcome here

23
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:13,834
because this is a very
bicycle-friendly place.

24
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:18,472
It... It isn't. It's the home
of Mercedes and Porsche.

25
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,342
- And Germany--
- (CHEERING)
- Exactly.

26
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,512
Germany...

27
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,649
Germany is the cradle
of the automobile.

28
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:30,818
The car was
actually invented here.

29
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,554
It's the last place on Earth
you can drive a car

30
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:36,790
as fast as it will go
on the motorway.

31
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,058
(CHEERING)

32
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,527
- It's true.
- All true.

33
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:42,630
This is a true fact.
This is a true fact.

34
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:45,233
The Germans are
the only people on Earth

35
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:48,369
who really know
how to make a car.

36
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:50,103
- This is--
- (CHEERING)

37
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:53,241
- It's a true fact.
- It's true.

38
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:54,442
I'll tell you a story.

39
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,244
There was a Mercedes engineer

40
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:58,912
and a Jaguar engineer
having dinner one night.

41
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,315
The Mercedes engineer
said, "Ve haf..."

42
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:02,716
Forgive the accent.

43
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,953
"Ve haf a quality test
at ze Mercedes factory.

44
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,557
Every night, ve take a car
off ze line at random.

45
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:12,726
Ve put a cat in it,
close ze doors.

46
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,296
If... When ve come back
in ze morning,

47
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:17,965
ve know the door seals
are vorking correctly

48
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,067
if ze cat has suffocated."

49
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,503
(LAUGHTER)

50
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,005
- Nah.
- (LAUGHTER)

51
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,774
The Jaguar engineer said,

52
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,643
"We've got something very
similar at our factory.

53
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,545
We take a car
off the line at random.

54
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,914
We put a cat in it.
We close the door.

55
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:35,883
And we know the car's
been built properly

56
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,019
if, when we come back
in the morning,
the cat hasn't escaped.

57
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,855
- (LAUGHTER)
- That is...

58
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:45,025
- True story.
- Yeah. True story.

59
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,560
The strange thing is,

60
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,729
it isn't just cars
that are built well here.

61
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:51,932
- It's absolutely everything.
- Except wine.

62
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,967
Yes, except wine. Sorry.

63
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,336
- (JEERING)
- Well, come on!

64
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:58,306
- Now come on!
- You drink that stuff?

65
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,309
I wouldn't
wash my hair in it.

66
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:02,676
- (LAUGHTER)
- Are you sure?

67
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,111
It is literally everything,
though.

68
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,479
German soft toys,

69
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,448
better than anybody
else's soft toys.

70
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:09,883
Cameras, kitchen appliances.

71
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,520
The Queen of England,
she's German.

72
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,555
She is. That's why
she's still working

73
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:17,758
even though she's a hundred
and forty seventeen years old.

74
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:20,461
There is no word here
for "that'll do".

75
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:23,931
There is no ambiguity
at all in Germany.

76
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,799
You certainly see this
with films.

77
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,569
The names you have
for American films.

78
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:31,171
I've got some here.
Remember Airplane?

79
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,106
Airplane, yes.

80
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,675
In Germany, it was called

81
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:38,512
The Unbelievable Journey
In The Crazy Airplane.

82
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,714
That is a comprehensive title.

83
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,115
You know where
you are with that.

84
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:43,951
What was Jaws?

85
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,987
- (PEOPLE CALL OUT)
- The what? The Weisse...?

86
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,756
The White Shark.

87
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,424
It should have been
The Massive Shark

88
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,361
That Explodes Eventually.

89
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:55,496
You know where
you're going with that.

90
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:57,898
What was...
What was Basic Instinct?

91
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,600
- (PEOPLE CALL OUT)
- Just not

92
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,703
A Brief Glimpse Of
Sharon Stone's Vagina?

93
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,238
- Shall we get on
with the show?
- Yes, good idea.

94
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:07,475
Because in tonight's
car programme...

95
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,479
Richard walks a dog.

96
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:15,015
James hangs around a gym.

97
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:17,951
And I say "Good shot."

98
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,554
Good shot.

99
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,122
But before all that,
I'd like to talk

100
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,792
about the original Honda NSX.

101
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,494
We have a picture of it here.

102
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,729
When that car
was launched in 1990,

103
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,531
it was considered remarkable

104
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:33,567
because it was fast
and exciting like a Ferrari,

105
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,703
but unlike a Ferrari
of the time,

106
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,171
it was also
incredibly reliable

107
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,441
and very, very easy to drive.

108
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:42,676
Honda killed that car off
12 years ago.

109
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:45,546
But finally, they've come up
with a replacement.

110
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:49,417
So I've been down to our
track to see what it's like.

111
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,086
This is it.

112
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,025
It costs £138,000.

113
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:02,430
Around the same
as a Porsche 911 Turbo S.

114
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,465
And it has
the futuristic lines

115
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:08,802
you would expect
of a rare-breed Honda.

116
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:13,674
Power comes from
a 3.5 litre twin-turbo V6.

117
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:17,778
Backed up by a squadron
of electric motors.

118
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:24,184
Together, they give
the NSX 573 horsepower.

119
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,319
So you would assume
the performance

120
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:29,957
is something to shout about.

121
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,492
Now, if you ask Honda

122
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,461
for the technical
information on this car,

123
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:36,464
they will email you
a file so enormous

124
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:38,198
that it actually
breaks the internet.

125
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:41,802
And yet, nowhere in it does
it mention the 0-60 time.

126
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:44,572
They simply refuse
to tell us what it is.

127
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,875
I know 0-60 times are
irrelevant in the real world

128
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,711
and they're rather childish,
but look, this is a supercar.

129
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:53,013
It's top trumps, isn't it?
It's important.

130
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,349
So I'm gonna find out what
it is for you using this.

131
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:58,852
It is a data-o-logger.

132
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,825
Right. Put it in Track mode.

133
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,494
Here we go. Launch control.

134
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,396
Foot on the brake.
Mash the pedal.

135
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:11,031
(ENGINE REVS)

136
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,203
(ENGINE ROARS)

137
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,006
Phwoarh!

138
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,512
I'm not sure that was
quite as neck-snapping

139
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:25,679
as a Nissan GTR,

140
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,781
but it wasn't far off.

141
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,050
Let's see what I did.

142
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,019
(BEEPING)

143
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:35,288
3.2 seconds 0-60.

144
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:41,529
Which means it isn't quite
as fast as a McLaren 570S,

145
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:44,532
or a 911 Turbo S,

146
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,867
or a Ferrari 488 GTB.

147
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,769
That's why they're
not mentioning it.

148
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,806
Honda is happy
to quote the top speed.

149
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:57,578
Which is 191 miles an hour.

150
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:59,146
But that too is slower
than its rivals

151
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,149
from Ferrari, Porsche,
and McLaren.

152
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,956
So has the new NSX
got anything

153
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,724
in the performance department

154
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,061
that makes it rise above
its supercar peers?

155
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,998
Well, yes, actually.

156
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:20,801
Firstly,
there are the brakes,
which are fly-by-wire.

157
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:23,003
There is no physical
connection to the pedal.

158
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,038
That's because they
have to harvest energy

159
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,474
to recharge
the battery system.

160
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:28,976
It's a much cleverer
version of that

161
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,911
than you get
on the Porsche 918,

162
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:33,581
a car that costs
five times as much.

163
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,015
Then there's
the hybrid system.

164
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,750
It uses not one
electric motor,

165
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,919
as you might expect,
but three.

166
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:42,856
And the way it uses them
is well good.

167
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,161
The one at the back

168
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,997
is the wingman
for the petrol engine,

169
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:53,601
filling the power gaps
when the turbos lag.

170
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:58,606
This gives the NSX ballistic
pick-up at any speed.

171
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:04,311
Look, instant shove.
It's lovely.

172
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:14,622
But it's the two at the front
that are the real party-piece

173
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,624
because they drive a wheel

174
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,226
each totally independently
of each other.

175
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,261
Which means this car has

176
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:25,098
a sort of space-age
four-wheel drive.

177
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,135
And that means
extraordinary things happen

178
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,337
when you throw it
into a corner.

179
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,146
So, as you approach
a corner like this one,

180
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,081
computers are
measuring the speed,

181
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:44,652
they're measuring G-force,
steering input, and so forth.

182
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,253
They're adding power
to the wheel

183
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,889
or taking power away from
the wheel as it's needed.

184
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,661
Then you get perfectly flat,
perfectly controlled corners.

185
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,831
It is a bit like
driving a Honda Civic!

186
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,934
There are people
who would say

187
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,270
that technology
like this in a car,

188
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,006
helping it feel secure,
will make it dull.

189
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,641
But it doesn't
feel dull to me.

190
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,242
It feels tremendous.

191
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:13,881
I'm going fast
and I'm relaxing.

192
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,749
What's wrong with that?

193
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,620
But the futuristic
four-wheel drive

194
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:23,590
isn't the only piece of
23rd-century engineering

195
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,292
on the NSX.

196
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,829
The aerodynamics,
for example, are so clever,

197
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:30,563
they can cool all the motors

198
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,134
while providing vast amounts
of grip-enhancing downforce

199
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:38,906
to the front and rear wheels.

200
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,074
And it does all this
without anything

201
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:45,012
as old-fashioned
as huge wings and spoilers.

202
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,993
It's not just the technology,
which is brilliant,

203
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,796
it's that that technology
is on this car.

204
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,765
Yes, we have
hybrid supercars.

205
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:07,134
We have the LaFerrari,
the McLaren P1,

206
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,601
the Porsche 918.

207
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:10,403
But they're in the
million-pound bracket.

208
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,341
This is only an eighth
of the price of the LaFerrari,

209
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,409
and it's actually cleverer.

210
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,312
- (ENGINE ROARS)
- I love this.

211
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,115
I love the way it looks.
I love the sounds it makes.

212
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,918
I like the sophistication
of the hybrid drive.

213
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,419
I like the performance.

214
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:29,322
I like the steering.
I like the interior.

215
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:30,824
I really, really like it.

216
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,360
And I find myself
wanting one quite badly.

217
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:40,000
The original NSX made
owning a supercar

218
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:42,569
less painful
and less expensive.

219
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:48,241
This has done the same
for the hybrid supercar.

220
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:51,411
It really is
a worthy successor.

221
00:11:57,785 --> 00:11:59,853
(CHEERING)

222
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:02,455
(APPLAUSE CONTINUES)

223
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,393
James, Honda...

224
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:10,263
Honda took ten years
to develop that car.

225
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,231
And?

226
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,400
Ten years is an enormous
amount of time

227
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,534
to do a car.

228
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,003
You can't criticise something

229
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,105
because people spent
too long on it.

230
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:21,074
People aren't gonna say
"I'm not gonna look round
Cologne cathedral.

231
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,443
They took 600 years
to build it!"

232
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,212
Ooh.

233
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,414
Anyway, I love it.
I love that car.

234
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,916
Anyway, look, we've heard

235
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,683
what you've got to say
about the NSX.

236
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:32,485
Now it's time to hand it over

237
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,154
to a man who thinks that...

238
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:37,057
Well, potted plants
are a Communist plot.

239
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,927
Yep. Here he comes.
It's the American!

240
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:48,501
Come to England.
Shit weather. Shit beer.

241
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,570
JEREMY: And he's off!

242
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,973
Clearly in a tremendous mood.

243
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,608
But it is very wet out there.

244
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,310
Wipers flapping away

245
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,313
as he powers onto
the Isn't Straight.

246
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,681
Looking good.

247
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:02,983
Where I come from,

248
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,118
this thing's badge
is inaccurate.

249
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:07,220
Kind of like
a loser's Cadillac.

250
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,189
And yet, strangely,
we're still waiting

251
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,959
for Cadillac's
hybrid supercar.

252
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,461
Right, now,
flying into Your Name Here,

253
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,364
this really is a good day
to have four-wheel drive.

254
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,499
I'm sure even the American
can appreciate

255
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:22,202
the Honda's
hi-tech features.

256
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,872
What is this
Space Invaders shit?

257
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:26,439
JEREMY: Clearly not.

258
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:29,742
Right, full power
for the Isn't again.

259
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:33,313
Electric ain't for engines.
It's for lights and chairs.

260
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,183
JEREMY: He is not
a modern man, is he?

261
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,618
Right, carving through
the standing water.

262
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,587
Into Old Lady's House.

263
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,355
Slithering about a bit.

264
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,893
Now he's leaning on it
for the Unsettled section.

265
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,795
Past the hangars
and up to Sub Station.

266
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:50,964
Hard on those wi-fi brakes

267
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,933
for the second-to-last corner.

268
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,102
How's he gonna manage
through here?

269
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,070
Yes, stepping out a bit
under power.

270
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,738
Through Field Of Sheep,

271
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:01,308
keeping it tidy through
there, and across the line!

272
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,343
(CHEERING)

273
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:09,549
(APPLAUSE DROWNS CHATTER)

274
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,785
Right,

275
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,524
let's see now where the NSX
goes on our lap board.

276
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,192
Let's have a look.

277
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,997
- Oh.
- Oh, dear, James.

278
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,367
(APPLAUSE DROWNS CHATTER)

279
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,270
James.

280
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,307
Why didn't you tell us
it was very slow?

281
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,278
- It's streaming wet!
- So hang on a minute.

282
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:41,281
We've had a review from
a tortoise and a wet lap.

283
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:44,117
Which means we've
learnt precisely nothing.

284
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,954
Um... Yeah, you're right.
Nothing at all.

285
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,989
- Nothing at all.
- So let's move on.

286
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:53,260
Yes, let's do that by
popping some loose change
in the ticket machine

287
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:56,729
so we can park awhile
on Conversation Street.

288
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,999
(JAZZ)

289
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,537
(CHEERING)

290
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,974
OK, now...

291
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:08,976
- I've got some conversation.
- Good.

292
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:12,980
Last night at midnight,
there was alarm in Stuttgart.

293
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,515
The Green Party
that runs the city

294
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:20,187
asked everyone here not to
use wood-burning stoves

295
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,990
and not to drive
their car today.

296
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,558
- Why?
- Because of the smog.

297
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:28,695
(LAUGHTER)

298
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,365
Am I making this up?

299
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,401
- There it is.
- (APPLAUSE)

300
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,507
I can't...

301
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,909
I can't imagine
anything clearer.

302
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,911
That is... That is gin-clear,

303
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:46,246
but according to
the Green Party...

304
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,847
I'm not making this up.

305
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,049
You're all
from Stuttgart, yes?

306
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,483
There is an alarm today

307
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,320
- because of the smog.
- Yes.

308
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,088
- (LAUGHS)
- Where is it?

309
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:59,159
How clear is it
on a good day?

310
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:02,762
- We've got a photograph here
of Beijing on now.
- (LAUGHTER)

311
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,564
Let us compare and contrast

312
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,135
Beijing on a smoggy day
with Stuttgart on a...

313
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,869
- Not the same.
- ...a smoggy day.

314
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,405
Can I just ask,
what would you have done

315
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,042
if they'd have
actually ordered you
not to drive cars?

316
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,543
At the moment,
it's an advisory.

317
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,311
If they said you are
banned from driving cars,

318
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,513
what would you have done?

319
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,150
Come on the train?
That's unbelievable.

320
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,651
But this is the thing

321
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,419
that we don't really
understand about Germany.

322
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,056
Once something becomes
a rule, it is a rule.

323
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,823
I once had a very
interesting conversation

324
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,192
with two friends of mine.

325
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,827
One is from California
and one is from Germany.

326
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:37,530
We were talking about
losing your driving licence.

327
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,667
The Californian said, "In
Germany, what would happen

328
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,536
if you lost your licence
and then you drove your car?"

329
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,738
The German said,
"No, you cannot do this."

330
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,374
(LAUGHTER)

331
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,642
He says, "I know
you're not supposed to,

332
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,244
but what if you did?"

333
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:54,081
He said, "No. You cannot
drive. You have no licence."

334
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:55,415
(LAUGHTER)

335
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:57,150
The Californian
went, "Yeah, man,

336
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,718
"but late one night,
you just...

337
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,220
hell, you go for a drive."

338
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:01,854
The German went,
"It is impossible

339
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:03,590
to drive without a licence!"

340
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:06,093
- Impossible!
- Impossible.

341
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,566
There's an interesting thing
I discovered here.

342
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:17,304
On a motorway,
obviously you can drive
as fast as you like.

343
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,971
You get people
sometimes, not often,

344
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,807
cos your lane discipline
is unbelievable,

345
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,477
but sometimes they sit in the
outside lane just dawdling.

346
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:28,248
If you tailgate them... OK?
I've got the fines here.

347
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:32,119
You get a 400 euro fine,
two penalty points,

348
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,921
and a three-month ban
for tailgating.

349
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,989
- That is extreme. Ouch!
- Yes.

350
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:38,525
But if you overtake them
on the inside,

351
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,360
just go past them
on the inside,

352
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:43,130
that's a 150 euro fine,
and one point.

353
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,464
Well, there you go.

354
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:47,134
No. This is where
it gets really good.

355
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:51,238
If you go on the hard
shoulder to overtake,
the emergency lane,

356
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:55,608
that's also one point
but only a 90 euro fine.

357
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,145
There's your answer.
That's what you do!

358
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,713
No, no.

359
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:06,519
No, because... Aha.
You may think that.

360
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,988
But if you fit your car
with blue lights,

361
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,623
flashing blue lights,
basically,

362
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,592
you turn you car
into a police car,

363
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:15,562
you get... I've got
the point fines here.

364
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:18,565
20 euro fine
and no points at all!

365
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:22,502
- What? You're joking!
- (LAUGHTER)

366
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:26,639
- No, you don't understand.
- That is true.

367
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,176
That is very strange
to our ears.

368
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,978
Cos if you tried that
at home in the UK,

369
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,614
you would be charged
with impersonating
a police officer,

370
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:38,185
and you would never
get out of prison, ever.

371
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:40,353
People say Germans have
no sense of humour.

372
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,522
If you want to know
what no sense of humour is,

373
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,624
impersonate a policeman
in Britain.

374
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,793
Then you'll know
what no sense of humour is.

375
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,897
Right, that is the end
of Conversation Strasse.

376
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,800
(CHEERING)

377
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,770
We all like the idea of
a sports utility vehicle.

378
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:00,707
A car that can handle
the Australian outback
at the weekend

379
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:05,011
and then set a new
lap record at Hockenheim
on a Monday morning.

380
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,214
But even the German
car-makers

381
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:09,849
can't seem to make
the concept work.

382
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,951
We've got this from Audi.
The RS Q3.

383
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,420
Which is a dismal car.

384
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,389
BMW have the X4,
I think that's called.

385
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:17,824
Don't want
one of those, either.

386
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,960
Mercedes have
this horrible monster.

387
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,629
They're all just rubbish.

388
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,232
And let me guess.
You have a solution.

389
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,699
- Yes, I do.
- Oh, God.

390
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,368
Yes, I do. A car

391
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:31,804
that is both sporty
and utilitarian.

392
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,240
This will be good.

393
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,742

396

in Britain's
muddy underbelly.

397
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,491
And obviously
a machine like this

398
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:56,263
cannot possibly be
converted into a sports car.

399
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,433
Or can it?

400
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:06,506
First of all, we have to remove
this rather ungainly body.

401
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,608
You can't do that
with a modern car

402
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:11,911
because the body is the
chassis. It's the skeleton.

403
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,481
If you take it away,
you're left with nothing more

404
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,583
than a collection
of unjoined-up parts.

405
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,051
However, you can
remove the body

406
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,387
on an old Discovery
like this,

407
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:23,790
using nothing more
than one of these.

410
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,501
with no help
from anyone else,

411
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,337
I ended up with this.

412
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:46,313
Obviously
it's still utilitarian.

413
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,448
It will still wade
through rivers

414
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:51,418
and crawl its way
up muddy banks.

415
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,453
But now there's a...

416
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,588
a sporty flavour as well.

417
00:20:57,156 --> 00:21:02,562
Without the heavy body, it
feels nimble, agile, light.

418
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:10,637
If it weren't for the fact
that the windscreen is now
very close to my face,

419
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:13,773
it would feel like
a Lamborghini Gallardo.

420
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,678
The only real problem
with this

421
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,847
is that Britain
is a police state,

422
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:23,450
and if I took this
on a public road,

423
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,685
I'd be stopped immediately

424
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:27,820
by the constabulary
who would point out

425
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,889
that I was
contravening about...

426
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:33,526
4,870 different laws.

427
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,366
It's not warm, either.

428
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,902
Oh, no, that's stupid!

429
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,971
Happily, both these
problems would be solved

430
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:48,808
when I fitted it with
the body from a sports car.

431
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:56,082
And this is the sports car
I've gone for.

432
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,852
A 1978 MGB.

...to the internal organs

437

It is incredible

441
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,959
that in a shed I have created
something which has...

442
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:44,897
eluded the combined might
of the motor industry.

443
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:49,436
It is a proper
sports utility vehicle.

445
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,440

00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:55,842

just how quick,

At this point, I decided,
for no particular reason,

524
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:25,712
to scrap the MG idea

525
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:27,980
and go for
something else instead.

526
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,452
This is what I chose.

527
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,255
A 1980s Mercedes SL.

528
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,825
Partly because
it's the very essence

529
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:40,727
of quiet, urban restraint,

530
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:42,561
taste and elegance.

531
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:47,199
It's a car that was driven
by Bobby Ewing in Dallas.

532
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,368
Mostly, though,
I chose it because

533
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:52,872
it would fit more snugly
on the Discovery chassis.

534
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:55,942
(TOOLS WHIRRING)

535
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,477
This time,
the men worked tirelessly

536
00:27:58,544 --> 00:27:59,979
for nearly a whole day

537
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:01,380
to marry the two cars

538
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:04,283
and the result
was spectacular.

539
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:11,457
It's a car
I have justifiably called...

540
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,093
The Excellent.

541
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,296
The internal organs
from a Landrover Discovery

542
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:22,802
mated to the beautiful skin
of a glamorous Mercedes SL.

543
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:25,037
To create a vision of pure...

544
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,273
What's the word?

545
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,608
- OTHERS: Rubbish.
- It's not rubbish.

546
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:32,779
RICHARD: Did you paint it
with a brush or a bucket?

547
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:35,848
It's got those headlights
that swivel when
you go round a bend.

548
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:37,649
So they point at the road.

549
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:39,385
OK, let me ask you this.

550
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,820
Which would you rather have?

551
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:42,789
The Excellent or that Porsche?

552
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:44,891
BOTH: That Porsche.
- Why?

553
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:47,994
Because it's better
in every single way.

554
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,129
To prove my cynical
colleagues wrong,

555
00:28:50,196 --> 00:28:53,032
I invited them
to go for a drive.

556
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,068
Oh, kind.

557
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:59,605
See? It's an optional extra
for the shorter gentleman.

558
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,274
- Are you comfy, Hammond?
- No.

559
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,811
- Is this as in as I can get?
- Yep.

00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:09,849
- Right, listen to this.

We'd only gone a few miles
before Richard and James

563
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:21,560
completely
changed their minds

564
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,596
and realised that The
Excellent was the best car

565
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:26,232
they'd ever been in.

566
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:27,934
No, we haven't.

568
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,237
I thought you'd
changed your mind.

569
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,272
No! Maybe a bit.
It's worse than I thought.

570
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:36,708
- Can I put the heater on?
- That's not connected.

571
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:38,110
- Is it not?
- No.

572
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:40,212
- What's that dial down there?
- Speedometer.

573
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,148
Why have you got that one,
not that one?

574
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:44,483
- That doesn't work.
- Has it got a fuel gauge?

575
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,618
- Not as such.
- Has it got
a temperature gauge?

576
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:47,987
Not really.

577
00:29:48,054 --> 00:29:49,889
There's a lot of wires
hanging out of the dash

578
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:51,924

to things.

JEREMY: I can as well.

00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:03,102
RICHARD: No, there's
a hole in the floor.

583
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:06,305
While Hammond and May had
one or two minor issues,

584
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:09,775
they both agreed that
if I were to put my car
into production,

585
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:12,244
it would make me a fortune.

586
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,513
No, we didn't agree
to that, either.

587
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,748
JEREMY: Look, I've
done the maths. Honestly.

588
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,584
The Discovery was £2,500.

589
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,820
Mercedes £4,500.
£7,000 for the work.

590
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:26,192
That's 14,000 quid. I could
sell this for £120,000.

591
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:27,927
- No, you couldn't.
- Yes, I could.

592
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:29,761
A Cayenne Turbo is 120.

593
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:33,465
A Cayenne Turbo is a proper
car built by Porsche.

594

This is two scrap cars
glued together by a Muppet.

595

for people like you.

themselves in the morning?

JEREMY: I'll tell you exactly
who will buy this car.

599

roundy-ended scissors.

600

Footballers.

601
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:53,419
- No, they won't.
- Footballers like Ferraris.

602
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:55,421
Yeah, and Bentleys
and Range Rovers.

603
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:58,057
- And Aston Martins.
- Not this thing.

604
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:05,164
To prove them wrong again,

605
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:10,469
I decided to head for
the nearby Chelsea
training ground.

606
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:13,372
These are people
who understand cars,
not like you two.

607
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:16,008
JAMES: Yeah, they understand
cars, that's why they buy

608
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:18,344
Range Rovers
and Aston Martins.

609
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,946
JEREMY: They buy those things

610
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:21,948
cos they didn't know
that you could do this.

611
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:24,450
- I like my car.
- RICHARD: It's shit.

612
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:32,124
They're flocking to it,
aren't they?

613
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:33,960
- You just watch.
- Do you mind

00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,363
if I go and stand
next to something else?

615

Soon some players arrived,

616
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,633
which gave Richard
and James a chance

617
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,370
to show off their
footballing knowledge.

618
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:45,972
You're really tall.
You should play in goal.

619
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:47,306
Yeah, I do, I play in goal.

620
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:49,008
- I'm the goalkeeper.
- I know that.

00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:50,409

are you from?

622
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:54,080
- I'm from Belgium.
- Oh.

00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,348

they're footballers?

624
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,849

recognise them?

695
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,933
Let's go for 1,000.

697
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:42,674
Let's get going.
Come on, let's sell this car.

698
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,678
- £1,000 here on my right.
- Are you bidding?

699
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:49,014
- No.
- Jeremy, are you bidding?

700
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,516
AUCTIONEER:
2,000 if you wish.

701
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,851
It's 2,000 and five.
Two, five.

702
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:56,087
3,000 now. It's 3,000 here.
Three, five anywhere?

703
00:35:56,222 --> 00:35:58,123
Three, one.

704
00:35:58,224 --> 00:36:00,626
At 3,100.

705
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,694
£3,200.

706
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,230
At £3,500.

707
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:07,233
- It cost me 14,000.
- 4,000.

708
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:09,401
At £4,000...

709
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:11,537
At £4,000, any more?

710
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:12,904
(SILENCE)

711
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:17,843
At £4,000.

712
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,445
Come and see us after.

713
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,347
You just lost ten grand.

714
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:23,915
He could have just
thrown it down the lavatory.

715
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:25,917
(AUCTION CONTINUES)

716
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:32,524
(CHEERING)

717
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:36,695
It was rubbish.

718
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:40,666
Hold on.

719
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:43,669
- You were bidding
on your own car.
- (LAUGHTER)

720
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:46,405
Well, a bit. I just wanted
to get the ball rolling.

721
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:47,806
But even then it didn't work

722
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,975
because you only sold it
for four grand.

723
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,777
It cost you 14,000 to make

724
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:54,713
so you cost our production
company £10,000.

725
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,548
No, no, not true.

726
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:59,285
- I put a reserve on it.
- What reserve?

727
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:01,287
£100,000.

728
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,289
- £100,000?
- So it didn't sell at all,

729
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:06,425
which means
you cost us £14,000?

730
00:37:06,492 --> 00:37:10,496
Well, yes, but we've
ended up with The Excellent.

731
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:14,366
No, we're stuck
with The Excellent.

732
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:16,402
It's really difficult to
know, working with you,

733
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:19,004
things like this,
is it ambition

734
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,773
or are you a lunatic?

735
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,410
Sadly there isn't time
to answer that question,

736
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:28,347
because it's time to play
Celebrity Brain Crash.

737
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:35,821
(CHEERING)

738
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:38,189
Our guest this week
is a local girl

739
00:37:38,324 --> 00:37:43,128
who is responsible
for one of my all- time
favourite pop songs,

740
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,163
99 Red Balloons.

741
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,399
She is a singer,

742
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,435
she's an armpit hair
enthusiast

743
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:51,703
and she's
an all- round good sport.

744
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,340
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Nena!

745
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:56,575
(CHEERING)

746
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:17,763
- Where is she?
- I've got no idea. Um...

747
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:21,433
Oh. Oh, no...

748
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,469
It's hard to see
through the smog,

749
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,371
but yes, that is...

750
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:28,640
- Oh, no.
- What's happened here is...

751
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:30,376
Nena...

752
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:33,044
yes, she's been
carried away by 99...

753
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,248
- ...red balloons.
- Oh, no.

754
00:38:37,383 --> 00:38:38,850
- Bad.
- (APPLAUSE)

755
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:46,257
Does that mean
she's not coming on, then?

756
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:48,760
Well, James, she's floated
up into the stratosphere,

757
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,963
her eyelids have frozen over
and her lungs are inside out.

758
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,932
So that is a no.

759
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,634
It's OK, though.

760
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:58,236
We anticipated
that Nena may float away.

761
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:01,039
We have a back-up plan.
We'll activate it.
You sit down.

762
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:05,010
You see, the thing is...
that more and more stuff,

763
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:08,179
these days, is being powered
by rechargeable batteries.

764
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:10,248
You know, phones, laptops.
That sort of thing.

765
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:12,884
And this is giving the world
a bit of a problem.

766
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:16,722
Because in Britain, our power
companies only produce

767
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:20,426
five per cent more power
than we need.

768
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,428
We're only just coping.

769
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:24,896
It's actually worse
in the United States

770
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:28,500
cos they produce 16% less
than they actually need,

771
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:31,437
which means they have
to import electricity.

772
00:39:31,437 --> 00:39:33,739
So what is gonna happen
as more and more people

773
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:36,074
are buying
and using electric cars?

774
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:39,077
We're gonna need more power.
We may not be able to cope.

775
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:40,612
The solution, you may think,

776
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,280
is to build
more power stations.

777
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:43,915
But if you even suggest that,

778
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:45,551
weird-beard
environmentalists run around

779
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,152
waving their arms
in the air, going,

780
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,287
"What about the polar bear
and the bats and the newt?"

781
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:52,458
Anyway, the point is
we are going to need
more and more power

782
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:55,360
to charge the batteries in
our phones, laptops and cars.

783
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:58,464
- Where are we
gonna get it from?
- This got us thinking.

784
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:02,400
How much electricity could we
possibly generate every day

785
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:02,468
How much electricity could we
possibly generate every day
just during our normal lives?

786
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:03,969
just during our normal lives?

787
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:07,939
And what if we could
harness it in some way?

788
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:13,078
JAMES: This is
an office block in
the centre of London.

789
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:17,215
Like many office blocks,
it has a revolving door,

790
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:22,320
which spins constantly
as people come and go.

791
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:25,957
So, why not simply connect
that door to a generator

792
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:30,996
and turn all that spinning
into electricity?

793
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:33,765
RICHARD: And it's not just
revolving doors, either.

794
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:37,636
Many of us have dogs

795
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:40,939
and every day we take
those dogs for a walk.

796
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,511
A dog scampers hither
and thither, running ahead

797
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:46,912
and snouting under hedgerows.

798
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:51,483
So why not attach it
to a trailer like this?

799
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,951
Dog pulls the trailer along.

800
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:55,621
Inside this wheel
is a dynamo.

801
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:58,023
It makes electricity,
goes along these wires

802
00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:59,024
and into this capacitor,

803
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,026
and when that dial
reads 100%,

804
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:03,261
I'm charging my phone,

805
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:04,630
So, dog's harnessed.

806
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,932
That was easy.
Attached to the trailer.

807
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:09,367
All I've got to do
is set her going.

808
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:12,203
And I've even planned
for that. So, here we go.

809
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,672
Fetch!

810
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:18,143
Ah-haa!

811
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,878
Yeah! Your favourite!

812
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,616
Chase!

813
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:27,886
Maybe this dog's broken?

814
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:31,322
Meanwhile, back in London,

815
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:33,091
James was charging his phone

816
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:36,094
from a contraption he'd
fitted to the revolving door.

817
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:50,208
And even Jeremy had decided
to get in on the action.

818
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:54,412
JEREMY: This school
sports day,

819
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:57,148
in my mind,
is a power station.

820
00:41:57,215 --> 00:42:00,185
All we have to do is fit
the children with harnesses

821
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:03,889
and I could have this
charged up in no time at all.

822
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:08,059
- (HOOTER)
- Here we go!

823
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,394
Straightaway we can see

824
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,297
that charge is being
produced.

825
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,799
Not much, but some.

826
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:16,835
Come on, all of you!
Come on!

827
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:20,305
Put your back into it!
Catch him! Chop-chop!

828
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:24,743
This is the work of a genius.

829
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,277
RICHARD:
Back in the countryside,

830
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:27,846
I'd mended my dog

831
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:30,415
and things were going
well here too.

832
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:33,384
As you can see,
the dog is now running,

833
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:34,686
the wheels are turning,

834
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:36,622
electricity is being
generated.

835
00:42:36,622 --> 00:42:40,025
He's basically
a four-legged Sellafield!

836
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:43,795
Sadly, however, in London,
it was the middle of the day

837
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:46,698
and no one had been using
James's door.

838
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:51,637
As a result,
his phone was dying.

839
00:42:51,637 --> 00:42:53,304
So he had to get radical.

840
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:58,076
(ALARM RINGS)

841
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:09,921
15%.

842
00:43:09,988 --> 00:43:11,690
Nice.

843
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,160
RICHARD: Apart from
a couple of hiccups...

844
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:16,795
Go!

845
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:23,568
You'll have to put a little
bit more effort in than that.

846
00:43:23,669 --> 00:43:25,904
...everything was going well.

847
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:28,073
The power was flooding in.

848
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:29,507
Oh, yes!

849
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:31,710
25%.

850
00:43:31,777 --> 00:43:33,511
And we were forced
to conclude

851
00:43:33,578 --> 00:43:36,682
that it had been a successful
day for all of us.

852
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:39,685
Well, when I say all of us...

853
00:43:40,686 --> 00:43:41,920
No. Look, listen.

854
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:45,891
I can see why you're
here. Um...

855
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,794
Obviously, fitting
children with harnesses

856
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,729
and then videoing them,

857
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:52,297
and they're not
my children...

858
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:06,211
I got... I got 45% charge
in my phone.

859
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:07,713
I got 41% charge.

860
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:11,917
I got a different
sort of charge.

861
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,151
Anyway, since we had proved--

862
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:14,786
well, Hammond and I
had proved--

863
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:17,188
that it was possible
to charge up a telephone--

864
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:21,026
I began to wonder
if we could charge up a car

865
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:24,129
using nothing more
than vanity.

(BIG BEN CHIMES)

867
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:30,201
JAMES: In London alone,
there are over 750 gyms,

868
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:32,470
and every day they are
full of people

869
00:44:32,537 --> 00:44:35,140
picking things up
and putting them down again

870
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:37,809
so they can be
more attractive.

871
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:41,813
So why not use
all this colossal effort?

872
00:44:42,748 --> 00:44:44,149
Let's harness it!

873
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:48,386
And that's exactly
what we have done.

874
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:49,988
Ten of the machines
in this gym

875
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:51,456
have been connected
to a device

876
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,225
which produces a smooth
flow of electricity

877
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:58,229
that's sent outside to this
G- Wiz in the car park.

878
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:02,868
Right now
the battery is flat.

879
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,569
So I'm going to plug it in

880
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:07,305
and then after eight hours,
we'll see how far I can drive

881
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:11,009
on electricity that's been
generated in there.

882
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:26,491
Come on, you're slacking.

883
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,043
Right. Unplug from the gym.

884
00:45:46,812 --> 00:45:48,814
Let's see how far we go.

885
00:45:55,386 --> 00:45:58,924
Look at this. This is epic
because I'm driving along

886
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,827
in a car, sort of.

887
00:46:01,893 --> 00:46:03,494
No fossil fuel
has been burned,

888
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:05,063
and no atoms have been split.

889
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,065
Nothing's been fracked up.

890
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,843
Look, there's a man
pushing that pushchair.

891
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:20,045
Stick a little dynamo
on that,

892
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,948
kid gets some fresh air,
I get more battery charge.

893
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:31,089
It's difficult to see who
loses from this arrangement.

894
00:46:31,156 --> 00:46:33,624
I get a trip home,
effectively for nothing,

895
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:36,862
the people going to the gym
feel good, look good,

896
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:39,630
they become healthier,
the NHS saves money,

897
00:46:39,697 --> 00:46:40,899
cos people are less likely

898
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:42,633
to have strokes
and what have you.

899
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,136
If one person in a hundred
gets a free gy...

900
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:51,542
Hang on.

901
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,883
I was enjoying
driving on pedal

902
00:46:57,916 --> 00:47:00,351
and cross-trainer power!

903
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:03,221
(HORN TOOTS)

904
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:06,958
And with that, I think
it's back to the tent.

905
00:47:07,025 --> 00:47:08,894
(CHEERING)

906
00:47:12,697 --> 00:47:14,900
James... James May,

907
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:17,903
how far did you get

908
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:20,171
after eight hours
of charging?

909
00:47:20,238 --> 00:47:22,908
Actually, it was
better than I expected.

910
00:47:22,908 --> 00:47:24,742
I did 21 miles.

911
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:27,913
Hang on, though. To get
from our office in London

912
00:47:27,946 --> 00:47:29,814
to my home in nearly Wales,

913
00:47:29,915 --> 00:47:33,018
that's 130 miles,
21 miles at...

914
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:35,120
So six stops at gyms,
eight hours a time,

915
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,521
and the actual driving,

916
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,323
it would take me three days

917
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:39,524
to get home!

918
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:42,127
Or, Hammond, just an idea,

919
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:44,996
you could maybe get
a petrol-powered car,

920
00:47:45,063 --> 00:47:46,932
put some petrol in it,

921
00:47:46,932 --> 00:47:48,466
and be home in two hours.

922
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,468
That's a better...
I'm gonna do that.

923
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:51,937
Yes. So there we are.

924
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:54,072
That's the future,
and it's made of petrol.

925
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:56,207
So we've
addressed that nicely.

926
00:47:59,044 --> 00:48:01,079
Moving on...

927
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,783
Now...

928
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:07,518
There are people
all over the world

929
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:11,456
who believe we are permanently
on the verge of nuclear war,

930
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:14,625
alien invasion
or zombie attack.

931
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:15,994
It isn't a niche thing.

932
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:18,496
There's 120,000 of these
people at least.

933
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:20,765
They call themselves
preppers.

934
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,433
- Morons.
- Shut up.

935
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,235
- Idiots.
- And these preppers,

936
00:48:24,302 --> 00:48:27,372
in order to prepare for
an extinction-level event,

937
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:29,074
stock their homes
with essential supplies,

938
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,242
they go out into the woods
and practise tactics,

939
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:35,013
and they create what
they call bug-out cars.

940
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,381
They're brilliant.
Here is one. Look.

941
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:38,583
- Look at that!
- Yeah! I know!

942
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:41,519
- No, Hammond,
that is not brilliant.
- It is.

943
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:44,655
Are you saying we can prepare
for a nuclear attack

944
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:49,227
by putting some spikes
on the wheels of a Hyundai?

945
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:50,861
What if the nuclear attack

946
00:48:50,996 --> 00:48:53,031
comes from the back
of the Hyundai?

947
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:54,732
All you're gonna do
with that car

948
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:57,568
- is snag your jumper on it.
- Oh, don't be so negative.

949
00:48:57,635 --> 00:49:01,006
In this show you have wasted
14,000 of our pounds

950
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:02,773
on your stupid Mercedes car.

951
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,442
You have wasted
all of our time

952
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:06,111
with your sweat-powered
electric car.

953
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:09,047
This is my thing.
Let me do it.

954
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:11,482
You do realise
there's no such thing

955
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:12,517
as a zombie, don't you?

956
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:15,120
- Don't spoil it for him.
- (LAUGHTER)

957
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:17,688
I like the idea
of being a prepper,

958
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:21,359
so I thought I'd have a go
at making my own bug-out car.

959
00:49:23,028 --> 00:49:25,063
(BIRD CAWS)

960
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:31,102
This is what I came up with.

961
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:38,609
It started life as a VW
campervan, high-top version.

962
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:41,846
But I've stripped it
of its hippie heritage

963
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:44,582
to turn it into a vehicle
that can bare its teeth

964
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:47,152
in a dangerous,
post-apocalyptic world.

965
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:53,091
And I love it!

966
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,628
I'm so unbelievably
pleased with this thing.

967
00:49:57,695 --> 00:50:03,701
I feel invincible,
ready, prepared.

968
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:05,536
Which is hardly surprising,

969
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:08,106
given the modifications
I've made.

970
00:50:09,274 --> 00:50:11,142
At the front,
a battering ram.

971
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:13,544
You can be pretty sure
the roads won't be clear.

972
00:50:13,611 --> 00:50:15,946
The ram itself
is fitted with spikes

973
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,982
for fending off zombies
at close quarters.

974
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:19,150
Then, up top,

975
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:20,918
a bank of powerful
rally lights

976
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:24,655
to cut through the murky soup
of a nuclear winter.

977
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:27,758
Of course, not everyone
I meet will be friendly.

978
00:50:27,825 --> 00:50:30,027
So, up here...

979
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:37,135
...weapons rack.

980
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:38,436
Everything I need

981
00:50:38,503 --> 00:50:41,839
to defend myself against
cannibals and zombies.

982
00:50:41,906 --> 00:50:44,775
Round here, water. Essential.

983
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:47,478
Subtle stuff too.
I don't want to stand out,

984
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:49,214
hence the camouflage paint.

985
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,715
But perhaps most importantly,

986
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:52,750
the whole of my
bug-out campervan

987
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:54,185
has been armour-plated.

988
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:57,555
I really have thought of
everything!

989
00:50:57,622 --> 00:50:59,023
No, you haven't!

990
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,359
All you've done is ruined
a perfectly good campervan.

991
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:03,394
No, I haven't!
It's brilliant.

992
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:05,263
It's bullet-proof all over!

993
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,265
- Bullet-proof? Is it?
- Yes.

994
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:08,866
- Is it?
- Yes, it is.

995
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:11,369
- Oh, yeah, sounds like it.
- Tanks feel like that.

996
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:14,605
OK, then, these are guns.
Use them.

997
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:17,542
- What, on you?
- No, on the van. Shoot it.

998
00:51:17,608 --> 00:51:19,444
- Are we ready, gentlemen?
- Yes.

999
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,214
- Ha! Didn't go through!
- (FIRES)

1000
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:24,349
Just chipped the paint.
That's all you've done.

1001
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:26,551
- Yes. Hammond?
- Yeah?

1002
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:28,153
What you're suggesting
is these aliens,

1003
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:31,021
they're going to travel
trillions of miles

1004
00:51:31,156 --> 00:51:34,325
using a propulsion system
that we can't even conceive

1005
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:37,162
and then they're going to
try and take over the world

1006
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:39,364
using .177 air rifles?

1007
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,832
Well, if they do,
I shall be ready for them.

1008
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:47,605
Especially given
what I've done in here.

1009
00:51:47,672 --> 00:51:50,708
Inside, I've turned this
once- humble campervan

1010
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:54,512
into literally
the highest-tech
command centre imaginable.

1011
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:57,014
Up front,
carbon dioxide scrubbers,

1012
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:58,616
just like the ones
on Apollo 13.

1013
00:51:58,683 --> 00:52:02,420
They will purify the air,
even in case of radiation.

1014
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:06,824
And you can measure
that radiation on these
systems up here.

1015
00:52:06,891 --> 00:52:09,294
Water. You may not
be able to find it.

1016
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,396
Need to make it.
It's essential.

1017
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:14,565
I've fitted a system
that recycles urine.

1018
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:17,702
Basically you do
your number ones up there.

1019
00:52:19,204 --> 00:52:20,238
Operate the pumps.

1020
00:52:20,305 --> 00:52:21,672
They send the results up,

1021
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:24,775
across, and into the water
purification system.

1022
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:29,280
It emerges from that as
purest drinking water.

1023
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:36,554
Food. I'm gonna need it.
I've got a chicken.

1024
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:38,856
It lays eggs.
They go in there.

1025
00:52:38,923 --> 00:52:42,059
And perhaps best of all,
the pâté de foie gras

1026
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:43,594
of the bug-out community--

1027
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,696
chicken soup.

1028
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:48,299
I love all this. Setting
out into the wilderness

1029
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:50,635
in my little house on wheels,

1030
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:55,139
knowing I've got everything
I need, whatever happens.

1031
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,642
What the...?

1032
00:53:00,245 --> 00:53:03,047
Am I penetrating
his bulletproof armour?

1033
00:53:03,248 --> 00:53:05,883
Yes. And his food.

1034
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:09,254
- (GUNSHOT)
- Oh! That's my own urine!

1035
00:53:11,322 --> 00:53:14,158
- Are you two doing this?
- Yes, he is!

1036
00:53:14,259 --> 00:53:17,562
I'd get out of the way
if I were you.

1037
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:19,697
The trouble with the chicken
is, it moves around,

1038
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:21,566
- making this a...

1039
00:53:23,268 --> 00:53:25,870
- Oh, good idea!
- Isn't it!

1040
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:30,541
Right, reloading, James.
Reloading.

1041
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:32,277

- Oh, yes!

1042
00:53:32,277 --> 00:53:33,944
(RAPID GUNFIRE)

1043
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,291
- Good shot.
- Not bad, was it?

1044
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,860
Sort of game over now,
really.

1045
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:50,928
Hm.

1046
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:53,631
Right...

1047
00:53:56,634 --> 00:53:58,436
It wasn't game over, though,

1048
00:53:58,503 --> 00:54:00,371
because I went back
to the drawing board

1049
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:02,340
and started again.

1050
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:07,412
Three months' work.

1051
00:54:07,478 --> 00:54:09,680
I've used the same basic
interior set-up,

1052
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:12,383
but I've completely re-thought
the armour plating,

1053
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:14,685
so that whatever
those two have...

1054
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,955
(DISTANT WHIRRING)

1055
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,896
Now, this is a Scimitar
light reconnaissance tank.

1056
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:30,801
It's small, it's quite fast,
and it's quite manoeuvrable.

1057
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:33,338
Its job is to skip around
the battlefield like a goat

1058
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:35,340
and find stuff.

1059
00:54:39,544 --> 00:54:42,347
Now, look at Hammond, running
around in a mad panic.

1060
00:54:42,347 --> 00:54:44,882
He thinks I'm gonna
shoot him, but I'm not.

1061
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:48,519
I'm just here
to mark him with a laser.

1062
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:50,455
He's gonna shoot him.

1063
00:54:57,495 --> 00:55:01,499
Yes, this is a Challenger 2
main battle tank.

1064
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,969
And this really is
a bug-out vehicle.

1065
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,271
It's certainly a lot better
than, I don't know,

1066
00:55:07,372 --> 00:55:10,508
a Hyundai with spikes
on the wheels.

1067
00:55:10,575 --> 00:55:14,379
It'll totally protect its
occupants from radiation,

1068
00:55:14,412 --> 00:55:16,714
nuclear fallout, gas,

1069
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:20,385
even a direct hit, thanks
to its incredible armour,

1070
00:55:20,385 --> 00:55:22,720
from any known
battlefield weapon.

1071
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:26,591
Then there's this gun,
which is--

1072
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:29,694
there's no other word--
enormous!

1073
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,061
120mm.

1074
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:32,730
And it could hit a target--

1075
00:55:32,797 --> 00:55:36,133
let's say
Richard Hammond's van--

1076
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:40,505
while the tank itself is doing
30mph over rough ground.

1077
00:55:41,972 --> 00:55:45,410
I think, though, today
I shall fire while stationary

1078
00:55:45,443 --> 00:55:47,945
because I want to
savour the moment.

1079
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,881
OK, thank you, chaps.
If we could stop there...

1080
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:52,182
Right, going down.

1081
00:55:52,249 --> 00:55:53,618
Roger. Going down.

1082
00:55:57,254 --> 00:55:58,656
Oh, dear!

1083
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:04,462
I've loaded the gun with
a high- explosive shell.

1084
00:56:04,529 --> 00:56:06,096
It's a tracer shell,
so we'll be able

1085
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:07,598
to monitor its progress

1086
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:10,568
as it arcs toward the target.

1087
00:56:10,635 --> 00:56:12,770
Oh, Commander Clarkson,
this is fantastic!

1088
00:56:12,837 --> 00:56:15,139
I can see him right there.
Have you got him?

1089
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,807
Yeah.

1090
00:56:18,275 --> 00:56:19,510
You bastards!

1091
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:21,946
Oh, just put him out
of his misery, will you?

1092
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:23,147
Fire!

1093
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:42,767
I'm not sure his bug-out
vehicle was quite as strong

1094
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:44,702
as he may have
led you to believe.

1095
00:56:49,474 --> 00:56:50,908
Right...

1096
00:57:00,685 --> 00:57:02,119
Many months later,

1097
00:57:02,186 --> 00:57:05,055
I was ready to unveil
my third attempt...

1098
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,093
...an impregnable fortress.

1099
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:13,097
Oh, yeah!

1100
00:57:15,065 --> 00:57:16,967
This is bug-out heaven!

1101
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:20,638
I've used as my inspiration

1102
00:57:20,705 --> 00:57:22,973
the armoured personnel
carrier from Aliens,

1103
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,811
on the basis that if it can
protect Sigourney Weaver

1104
00:57:26,877 --> 00:57:30,080
from that metal bitey
thing with teeth,

1105
00:57:30,147 --> 00:57:34,118
it can keep me safe
from Jeremy Clarkson
and James May.

1106
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:37,922
Underneath this beast
are the basic elements
of an Alvis Stalwart.

1107
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:41,358
So it was already
armour-plated, amphibious,

1108
00:57:41,425 --> 00:57:42,793
massively powerful,

1109
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,962
six-wheel drive
and four-wheel steering.

1110
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:54,605
And what I've gone and done
is improve it.

(HISSING)

1112
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:06,283
It's got a honeycombed
lattice work

1113
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,452
of ceramic-steel
armour plating.

1114
00:58:08,553 --> 00:58:10,788
It's three times thicker
than the armour you'll find

1115
00:58:10,855 --> 00:58:14,559
on the turret of
an Abrams A1M1 tank.

1116
00:58:18,095 --> 00:58:22,967
In testing, I fired a 7.62
round at that hull,

1117
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:25,870
and all it left
was a mark like that one.

1118
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:28,939
This thing is incredible.

1119
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:37,081
Whatever those two
are planning this time,

1120
00:58:37,147 --> 00:58:38,683
it won't work.

to damage my soup now.
