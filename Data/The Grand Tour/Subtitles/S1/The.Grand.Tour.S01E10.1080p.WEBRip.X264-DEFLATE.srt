00:01:16,942 --> 00:01:19,198
Hello, and welcome
to The Grand Tour,

11
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:22,159
which this week
comes to you from Nashville!

12
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:23,821
There it is.

13
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:29,156
It was er... It's a city that
was named after General Nash.

14
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:31,591
Big war hero,
kicked the British out.

15
00:01:31,854 --> 00:01:33,736
He got er...

16
00:01:34,486 --> 00:01:38,211
You ended up with independence. And
how's that working out for you?

17
00:01:39,596 --> 00:01:42,277
I only ask because we were
looking the other day at the

18
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:44,534
bestselling cars
in America these days.

19
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,502
This is the top five.

20
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,101
There you go, that's
independence... working well.

21
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:52,893
Toyota, Honda, Toyota,
Nissan, Honda.

22
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,573
So what is actually made
in Detroit these days, then?

23
00:01:55,768 --> 00:02:01,088
Er... Well, mostly they just grow
sustainable organic peace beans.

24
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:04,407
- Oh! I mean, it's just women
with armpit hair growing kale.

25
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:06,016
That's all
that's going on there...

26
00:02:06,088 --> 00:02:08,362
municipal farms
for the community.

27
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,198
Now, the reason
we've come to Nashville

28
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:12,674
is very simple, in fact.

29
00:02:12,745 --> 00:02:14,956
It's because I've been
to all 50 of the US states,

30
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:16,534
but I'd never been here before.

31
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:18,182
And what a town!

32
00:02:18,282 --> 00:02:19,784
Yeah.

33
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:23,688
- Love it.
- Who knew?

34
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,682
- We are loving it.
- Who knew?

35
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:27,193
It is a great place,
we're loving it,

36
00:02:27,217 --> 00:02:29,244
and the music is amazing.

37
00:02:29,338 --> 00:02:31,525
Loving that... very much.

38
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:33,898
- Well...
- What?

39
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:35,698
- Not really.
- Mate, you can't...

40
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,760
This is known as Music City USA.

41
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:40,502
- That's what it is, where we are.
- Um, but it isn't, is it?

42
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:41,606
Because Detroit is.

43
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,841
Oh, no. Listen... No.

44
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:45,331
It is.

45
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:46,944
Motown... Motown

46
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,346
is just three minutes
of jangly nonsense.

47
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,221
- Oh, come on, Hammond!
- It is!

48
00:02:51,268 --> 00:02:52,815
Hammond, it just isn't!

49
00:02:52,877 --> 00:02:54,323
You cannot possibly say that.

50
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:55,385
Country and western music

51
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,073
is designed
to make you miserable.

52
00:02:57,213 --> 00:02:59,534
Motown is designed
to make you happy.

53
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,690
No, he's absolutely right.
Motown is happier music.

54
00:03:01,752 --> 00:03:03,252
I mean, take something like

55
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:05,479
Martha Reeves
"Dancing In The Streets", OK?

56
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:07,057
Listen to how happy
the words are.

57
00:03:07,112 --> 00:03:10,221
"Every guy, grab a girl,
everywhere around the world."

58
00:03:10,268 --> 00:03:12,221
Isn't that what Donald
was telling us to do?

59
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:19,348
Well, he was, wasn't he?
He did. He did.

60
00:03:19,397 --> 00:03:21,629
No, he said,
"Every guy, grope a girl."

61
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,567
A very different thing.

62
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,175
Detroit isn't just Motown.
Bob Seger's from Detroit.

63
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:27,552
It's just housewives' music.

64
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:30,020
- Ted Nugent
- Mad!

65
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:31,778
- Iggy Pop.
- Ridiculous.

66
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:33,395
- Madonna.
- Annoying.

67
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:35,043
- Eminem.
- Can't sing.

68
00:03:35,093 --> 00:03:36,856
- Alice Cooper.
- Ridiculous again.

69
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:38,793
- Half of The Eagles.
- Which half?

70
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,723
- Glenn Frey.
- I don't like that half.

71
00:03:42,465 --> 00:03:44,942
Nashville. Right, what's come
out of here? Miley Cyrus.

72
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:46,012
Brilliant!

73
00:03:48,872 --> 00:03:51,052
- You just said that out loud on television.
- I did.

74
00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:53,302
And...
And The Allman Brothers.

75
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:54,730
Never heard of them.

76
00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:56,677
You have.

77
00:03:56,723 --> 00:03:57,864
The Allman Brothers,

78
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:59,653
they had that one hit,
instrumental.

79
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:01,490
- What was it called?
- Jessica.

80
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:02,669
Jennifer.

81
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,028
Oh, I hated that.

82
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:05,356
You never hear it
any more, do you?

83
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,658
No. Rubbish.

84
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:07,848
Weirdest thing.

85
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,361
Weirdest thing.

86
00:04:09,386 --> 00:04:10,660
- Oh, hello.
- A message.

87
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:11,805
Oh, sorry.

88
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:13,317
This is a message
from Mr Wilman.

89
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,513
We've gone a bit off topic.

90
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,797
He might be cross.
We have a bit.

91
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:18,317
There is a car thing here
we ought to talk about.

92
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:21,606
It's called coal rolling.
Are you familiar with this?

93
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,141
It has its origins in a sport

94
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:27,059
where people go with their
pickup trucks into a field

95
00:04:27,138 --> 00:04:29,620
and see who can tow
the heaviest thing.

96
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,456
- Yep. Oh, yep.
- We've got some footage here of it happening.

97
00:04:32,635 --> 00:04:35,262
Look at that! The man in a pickup
truck towing a heavy thing.

98
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:36,830
There you go.

99
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,971
Things you will never hear
said at that event:

100
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:41,221
"Got to rush, lads. I'm
late for a poetry reading."

101
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:44,104
That's truck number three...

102
00:04:44,128 --> 00:04:45,307
Bernie Sanders, everybody.

103
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:48,619
Anyway, the thing is,
they worked out

104
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:49,931
they could pull
more heavy things

105
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:52,753
if they fiddled with the ECU
on the diesel engines,

106
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,901
because that would
generate more power,

107
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:56,901
and, as a by-product,
more smoke,

108
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:58,846
cos that's why it's
called coal rolling.

109
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,955
And now, various kids have started
to do it out on the highway.

110
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,439
What they do is go
out on the street

111
00:05:03,463 --> 00:05:05,979
and then do it when they
overtake a Toyota Prius.

112
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:08,667
Look at this. Here we go.

113
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:12,885
Oh, for God's sake!
Really?! Oh, come on!

114
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:14,620
Really?!

115
00:05:15,057 --> 00:05:17,081
- Now, I...
- That's just...

116
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:20,331
I just... I know,
I know I shouldn't say this.

117
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:22,448
But every time
I overtake a Prius,

118
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:24,969
I always think,
"I could do this in fourth...

119
00:05:25,143 --> 00:05:27,010
"but I'm gonna use
second instead

120
00:05:27,253 --> 00:05:28,651
to annoy them even more."

121
00:05:28,698 --> 00:05:31,370
You do know
you are 56 years old?

122
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:33,737
- Yeah, but I've got a mental age of nine.
- Oh, yeah.

123
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:36,245
- Shall we get on with the show?
- Yeah, it's time.

124
00:05:36,307 --> 00:05:39,995
On with the show.
In our car show this week...

125
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:44,362
James runs over a sun lounger.

126
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,378
Richard has a beer.

127
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:52,081
And I go on a thing.

128
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:53,862
Jesus!

129
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:56,776
Anyway, before all that,

130
00:05:56,862 --> 00:05:58,262
we've been having
a bit of a debate.

131
00:05:58,307 --> 00:06:01,547
You see, I say you don't
need to buy a BMW M3

132
00:06:01,603 --> 00:06:06,392
because for £11,000 less
you can have a Jaguar XE S,

133
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:08,236
which is nicer to drive,

134
00:06:08,314 --> 00:06:10,502
more comfortable
and just as fast.

135
00:06:10,549 --> 00:06:12,470
- It isn't just as fast.
- Yes, it is.

136
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:15,220
- No, it isn't.
- They both do 155mph.

137
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:18,822
Yes, because the BMW has been
electronically limited to 155.

138
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:20,713
The Jag is just... limited.

139
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:22,742
Sorry to interrupt.

140
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,298
It's just that both my
colleagues are wrong.

141
00:06:24,322 --> 00:06:26,998
Because if you want a small,
fast saloon car,

142
00:06:27,064 --> 00:06:28,517
what you absolutely
have to have...

143
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:29,644
If you're gonna start going on

144
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:32,564
about that Alfa Romeo
Giulia Quadrifoglio,

145
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,040
I am gonna stab you
in the eye with this pen.

146
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,822
- No, he's...
- A number of times.

147
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:40,439
He's right. Alfa Romeo
have not made a decent car

148
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:42,158
for 30 years.

149
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:43,986
- Erm...
- "Erm" nothing,

150
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,470
because we need to get
back to the point.

151
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:46,494
James and I have decided

152
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,072
it was time to sort out
this Jaguar-BMW debate

153
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,517
with a proper old-school
road test in Scotland.

154
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:04,951
Hello, and welcome to Wales,

155
00:07:04,997 --> 00:07:08,411
where I've come with all of
our film crews and this,

156
00:07:08,576 --> 00:07:14,935
the brand-new Alfa Romeo
Giulia... Quadrifoglio.

157
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:17,021
I think.

158
00:07:17,107 --> 00:07:18,549
Whatever.

159
00:07:18,724 --> 00:07:22,185
Let's get on now
and see what's what.

160
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,607
Now, for this to be
a proper Alfa Romeo,

161
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,573
there must be...
something wrong with it.

162
00:07:33,638 --> 00:07:34,747
Think about it.

163
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,435
A person
who's kind to his mother

164
00:07:37,513 --> 00:07:41,536
and punctual and sober and
well-dressed, he's an Audi.

165
00:07:41,731 --> 00:07:45,059
And nobody
wants a friend like that.

166
00:07:45,154 --> 00:07:48,076
If you're going to form
a relationship with a car,

167
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,458
if you're gonna develop a bond,

168
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,669
it's got to have
human qualities.

169
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:54,952
And if it's gonna have
human qualities,

170
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:57,904
it's got to have faults.

171
00:07:58,326 --> 00:08:02,560
And this car, I'm delighted
to say, has a big one.

172
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,488
I don't know quite how
they've managed this,

173
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:09,633
but it's not very easy
to get out of.

174
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,836
You've got this pillar here,
then the wheel here,

175

They put the door in the
wrong place. It should be...

to compensate.

is part of the same company
as Alfa Romeo,

221
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,826

231
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:11,490
That is 60 more than you get
from a BMW M3. 60!

232
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:17,318
It's 175 more

233
00:11:17,396 --> 00:11:18,779

that James would be
droning on about now,

had I not stepped in
and saved the day.

236
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,465
And then there's
the way it revs.

237
00:11:32,702 --> 00:11:34,316
Ha!

238
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:40,941
Most turbocharged engines are
a bit wheezy at the top end,

239
00:11:41,026 --> 00:11:44,332
but because
the twin-scroll turbo in this

240
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:47,511
is mounted in the V
of the engine...

241
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:50,454
just like it is
in a Ferrari California,

242
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:51,925
coincidentally,

243
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,761
the rev counter is still a blur

244
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,183
right up to the red zone.

245
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:17,615
This engine is...

246
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:20,838
it's a masterpiece.

247
00:12:20,952 --> 00:12:23,026
An absolute gem.

248
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,393
So, while this may
look like a Wolseley,

249
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,534
it certainly doesn't
go like one.

250
00:12:32,963 --> 00:12:38,643
It has a top speed,
in fact, of 191mph.

251
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,784
What this car is

252
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,706
is a Ferrari...

253
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:48,206
wearing
four-door sensi-panties.

254
00:12:49,838 --> 00:12:54,851
And that brings me onto
this car's party piece.

255
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:58,792
At normal speeds, it's very
quiet and very civilised.

256
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:00,924
And even though
it's running on wheels

257
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:03,860
that appear to have come off
the bottom of a sofa,

258
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:05,129
it's very comfortable,

259
00:13:05,154 --> 00:13:06,549
even if you push this,

260
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:09,073
you put it in
bumpy-suspension mode.

261
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:13,870
The only setting
I haven't yet tried

262
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,042

263
00:13:16,974 --> 00:13:18,284
But I think I should.

264
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:19,385
Sadly, however,

265
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:21,721
before I found somewhere
to try it out,

266
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:24,768
I received a telephone call.

267
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:32,557
Oh, no. What?

268
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:35,602
Have you got our film crew somewhere?

269
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,439
- Yes, I have.
- Are you using them to film an Alfa?

270
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,393
- Yes, I am.
- Where are you?

271
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:43,518
- Wales.
- Wales?!

272
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:45,721
You can't just arrange
that we go to Scotland

273
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,245
and then disappear off to Wales.

274
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,792
I didn't tell you
to go to Scotland.

275
00:13:48,893 --> 00:13:50,979
You decided to go
to Scotland on your own.

276
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,800
We've come
all the way to Scotland

277
00:13:53,824 --> 00:13:55,581
to do this with these two cars.

278
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:58,385
This is the test.
You trying to shoehorn...

279
00:13:58,643 --> 00:14:00,588
It's wonderful there are
Alfa Romeos in the world.

280
00:14:00,612 --> 00:14:02,643
That's a lovely thing
that we can all...

281
00:14:02,713 --> 00:14:04,132
It doesn't matter
how good you think

282
00:14:04,156 --> 00:14:06,112
the Alfa Romeo is.
This is a car programme.

283
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:08,759
Concepts, dreams,
imagining things.

284
00:14:08,823 --> 00:14:11,338
Scotland, with two cars
that are credible, relevant,

285
00:14:11,448 --> 00:14:13,221
important, work and are real.

286
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:15,604
They were still
shouting at me as I arrived

287
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:18,120
with all of the film crews
at our track.

288
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,936
Itch, that
you've managed to scratch

289
00:14:19,937 --> 00:14:21,120
over the last ten years.

290
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:22,800
I don't know how. Why...

291
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:24,533
It's breaking up!

292
00:14:24,557 --> 00:14:26,987
Oh, I've lost you!

293
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:35,235
Race mode.

294
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:39,370
Here we go.

295
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:53,756
In race mode, everything
is in a tensed-up state:

296
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:56,881
the throttle response,
the gearbox, the steering.

297
00:14:57,014 --> 00:15:00,451
And the traction control is off!

298
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:22,588
This has now been transformed

299
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:24,534
from something
that was brilliant...

300
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:28,409
into something
that is sensational.

301
00:15:37,612 --> 00:15:41,862
Of course, you'd never drive
in race mode on the road,

302
00:15:41,971 --> 00:15:45,612
in the same way you'd never take
your wristwatch into space.

303
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:51,377
But it's nice to know that it
would still work if you did.

304
00:15:52,144 --> 00:15:53,564
And this does.

305
00:15:53,643 --> 00:15:55,924
Oh, boy, this does.

306
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:03,338
I've always said you can't
be a true petrolhead

307
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,213
until you've owned
an Alfa Romeo.

308
00:16:06,323 --> 00:16:08,120
And the trouble is,
I've always known

309
00:16:08,174 --> 00:16:09,698
there's no Alfa Romeo

310
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:13,010
a true petrolhead
would actually want to buy.

311
00:16:13,884 --> 00:16:15,152
There is now, though.

312
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,302
Oh, there is now.

313
00:16:30,627 --> 00:16:33,807
And so I decided to do
something I've never done

314
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:37,291
with any car I've ever
filmed in my entire life.

315
00:16:37,403 --> 00:16:39,424
I decided,
when the test was over,

316
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,588
to go to the nearest
Alfa Romeo dealer...

317
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:44,815
and buy one.

318
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:07,108
What?

319
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:15,479
- What?
- You total cock.

320
00:17:15,528 --> 00:17:17,080
You stole our film.

321
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:18,762
Well, not really.

322
00:17:18,911 --> 00:17:20,747
You didn't actually buy one,
did you?

323
00:17:20,852 --> 00:17:22,622
Well, no, cos I couldn't
make my mind up

324
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:23,817
between that and the 4C.

325
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,192
And it was great. It was like
watching an ape return to its cage

326
00:17:26,216 --> 00:17:28,887
and finding there was
an apple and a banana.

327
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,362
"Oh, I like apple,
but I like bananas.

328
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:33,530
So do I want the apple
or a banana?"

329
00:17:33,575 --> 00:17:34,910
You would
have had both, obviously.

330
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:36,411
Hammond, that car is brilliant,

331
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,559
and it only costs £60,000.

332
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:40,801
Yeah, but honestly, Jeremy,
that doesn't mean anything.

333
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:42,450
If Alfa Romeo
launched a dog turd,

334
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:43,427
you'd say it was brilliant.

335
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:45,473
It is! I'm not making it up!

336
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,512
You heard it. You saw it.
It's a fantastic car.

337
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:49,981
Anyway, listen, we must find out

338
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:54,685
how fast the Quadri-thingy
goes round the Eboladrome.

339
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,090
That, of course,
means handing it over

340
00:17:56,114 --> 00:17:58,522
to a man who thinks
that tennis is something

341
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,841
that was invented by Stalin.

342
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,075
He's actually
a local boy this week,

343
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:04,278
from the next state along.

344
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,262
It's the American!

345
00:18:09,182 --> 00:18:10,315
There he is.

346
00:18:10,386 --> 00:18:11,622
And even he will enjoy

347
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,271
this magnificent machine,

348
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,762
I'm sure of that.

349
00:18:14,841 --> 00:18:17,153
And he's off
with a glorious bark

350
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,091
and a pop
from that sensational V6.

351
00:18:20,144 --> 00:18:21,255
Oh, it's wet!

352
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,074
OK. Alfa Romeo Julie Quad Bike

353
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:27,442
something or another.

354
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,364
I can't say it,
can't pronounce it.

355
00:18:30,785 --> 00:18:32,730
I don't really like driving it.

356
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,992
Oh, for God's sake!

357
00:18:36,177 --> 00:18:39,489
So, the tall one thinks
this is a good car.

358
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:43,033
I still think he was dropped
on his head as a child.

359
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:46,302
Yeah, but at least I don't
wear a cowboy hat to weddings.

360
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:50,091
Right, now, powering majestically
into Your Name Here.

361
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:53,160
This could be the single
greatest lap we'll ever see.

362
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,684
See, what are you on about?

363
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:55,817
It's
beautifully balanced,

364
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:57,153
hard on the power.

365
00:18:57,278 --> 00:18:59,356
A bit of a wobble there!
Some oversteer,

366
00:18:59,411 --> 00:19:00,395
but it was designed to do that.

367
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,420
No, it wasn't!

368
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:02,490
Stop saying
things, Hammond.

369
00:19:02,514 --> 00:19:03,841
I'm busy.

370
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:06,036
This is just a BMW

371
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:08,318
for people
who like fancy coffee.

372
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:11,928
No, it's a BMW for people
with taste and discernment.

373
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:13,739
No, it's a BMW for idiots.

374
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,802
Hammond, be quiet!

375
00:19:14,832 --> 00:19:16,271
Look at the way it's dealing

376
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,168
with Old Lady's House.

377
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:19,812
Almost no problems at all.

378
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:21,402
Now he can really turn it up

379
00:19:21,473 --> 00:19:22,673
for the sprint to Substation.

380
00:19:22,674 --> 00:19:25,034
Such power! Such pedigree!

381
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,503
- Such bollocks.
- Just be quiet!

382
00:19:27,574 --> 00:19:29,245
Just two corners left.

383
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:31,917
Glorious poise in the rain
through there.

384
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:33,199
Field Of Sheep.

385
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:35,542
Another master class
in suspension control.

386
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:36,920
And across the line!

387
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:41,725
- Well, come on, then.
- Well, no...

388
00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:43,259
Come on. What did it do?

389
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,972
- What?
- Time.

390
00:19:45,062 --> 00:19:46,738
No, it was wet,

391
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,628
so there's no point
putting it on the board.

392
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:49,934
It'll just wear the computer out

393
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,535
- for no reason.
- Get on with it!

394
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,314
- We haven't got time! But I' not able...
- Get on with it!

395
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:54,957
All right, I'm gonna do it.
Let's look at the time.

396
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:58,597
There we go. Time for Jeremy's
Alfa Quadriplogio.

397
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:02,378
- That's not quick, mate!
- I'm sorry.

398
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:03,402
That's rubbish!

399
00:20:03,464 --> 00:20:05,949
In the dry,
it would have done a 1:15.

400
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,605
- No, it wouldn't.
- Yes, it would.

401
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:08,919
- No, it wouldn't.
- It would!

402
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:10,650
There's no point arguing anyway.

403
00:20:10,675 --> 00:20:12,448
He's got the Alfa Romeo
thing out of his system,

404
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:14,400
which is good,
because it's time now

405
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:15,933
for us to enjoy a gentle stroll

406
00:20:15,984 --> 00:20:19,409
along the sunlit sidewalks
of Conversation Street.

407
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:25,035
♪♪

408
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,807
- That's a good one.
- I like that one.

409
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:32,355
It is. Right, now...

410
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:36,647
OK. And we start with this.

411
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,886
It's the new Alfa Romeo Stelvio.

412
00:20:38,956 --> 00:20:42,222
- For God's sake!
- This is important news.

413
00:20:42,305 --> 00:20:45,532
It's not important news.
It's niche news for morons.

414
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:47,635
It's not!
It's a superb car,

415
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:49,025
because you can have it

416
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,870
with the same
500 horsepower engine

417
00:20:50,924 --> 00:20:52,650
that you get
in the Quadriplegio.

418
00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:55,732
And with that... with that
you get four-wheel-drive.

419
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:58,068
So that one will work
in the wet, will it?

420
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:00,783
Hammond,
when somebody has a baby,

421
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,174
OK, do you go up to it and...

422
00:21:02,213 --> 00:21:03,689
"Oh, look at my new
baby that I've...

423
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:05,208
Eurgh! It's really ugly!"

424
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:07,210
Well, only if it's ugly.

425
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,269
You see, you can't be cruel
about Alfa Romeos.

426
00:21:10,582 --> 00:21:12,083
- Yes, I can.
- They're trying so hard!

427
00:21:12,107 --> 00:21:14,847
Well, let's just move it on.
Forget the Alfa, then.

428
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:17,371
Now, we should talk
about where we are,

429
00:21:17,449 --> 00:21:21,457
OK, Tennessee, because this is the
bestselling vehicle in the state.

430
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:22,956
OK.

431
00:21:23,902 --> 00:21:26,396
Yeah, we've got a picture
of the police car.

432
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,105
And an ambulance.

433
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,168
- And a hearse.
- Yeah.

434
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,137
I'm detecting...
detecting a theme here.

435
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:35,906
The pickup truck,
I think I'm right,

436
00:21:35,907 --> 00:21:38,174
is very popular in this
neck of the woods, yes?

437
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:40,143
I'm sure you may
be amazed to hear

438
00:21:40,144 --> 00:21:42,613
they really haven't
caught on at all in the UK.

439
00:21:42,614 --> 00:21:44,247
I mean, almost nobody has one.

440
00:21:44,248 --> 00:21:45,916
You hardly see them,
which is a shame,

441
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:47,651
because I love a pickup truck.

442
00:21:47,652 --> 00:21:49,620
- Yeah, we know.
- I like a truck.

443
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:50,921
- You know?
- Yes.

444
00:21:50,922 --> 00:21:53,630
I can say that here.
I can say that here.

445
00:21:53,715 --> 00:21:57,066
That's fine, you can say that, but not
they're actually very sensible. All right.

446
00:21:57,106 --> 00:21:58,254
Look, mate,
that's not everything.

447
00:21:58,278 --> 00:21:59,934
Anyway, you drive around
in your Ferrari, OK,

448
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,403
and happily put up with the
compromises that that imposes.

449
00:22:02,497 --> 00:22:04,500
So you put up with the cost,
the inconvenience,

450
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:07,037
and it's not very comfortable
because it's a fast car.

451
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,348
Same with a pickup.
You put up with compromises:

452
00:22:09,373 --> 00:22:11,442
the weight, the size,
the fuel consumption...

453
00:22:11,492 --> 00:22:12,793
But what's the upside?

454
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:14,552
It's a pickup truck!
You can use it...

455
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,059
You can put logs in it

456
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,856
and tow... tow trees
out of the woods with it.

457
00:22:18,895 --> 00:22:20,216
You could put a bear in it.

458
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:23,219
Hammond, you work...
you work in the media!

459
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,090
The only thing you have to
put in the back of a vehicle

460
00:22:25,114 --> 00:22:27,557
are invitations to gala lunches.

461
00:22:27,653 --> 00:22:28,950
- Well...
- That's all you ever do.

462
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,388
The problem,
actually, in Britain

463
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,162
with a pickup truck...
I'm sorry to admit this...

464
00:22:32,163 --> 00:22:35,231
is that if you pulled up
at a set of traffic lights

465
00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:36,785
and you had your cement mixer

466
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:38,184
and your chainsaw in the back,

467
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,614
they would be stolen
immediately.

468
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,520
Anything left
in the open in Britain,

469
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,489
it's like nuts at a party,
you just help yourself.

470
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,458
- So why
doesn't that happen here?

471
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,179
Who's got a pickup truck here?

472
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:51,599
Holy cow! That's unbelievable.

473
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:53,911
When you go shopping
and put things in the back,

474
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:56,075
why doesn't someone
just help themselves?

475
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,788
Because they shoot them here.

476
00:22:59,114 --> 00:23:01,692
Well, there is that.

477
00:23:01,717 --> 00:23:06,129
There is that.
Thank you, Donald!

478
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:08,528
But why... Have you ever
had anything stolen

479
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:09,677
when you were at a red light?

480
00:23:09,701 --> 00:23:11,567
Never? Has anyone
ever had anything...?

481
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:13,269
- No.
- No?

482
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:14,528
I thought this was
supposed to be

483
00:23:14,552 --> 00:23:16,497
crime-ridden in America.

484
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:17,808
Maybe people are honest.

485
00:23:17,872 --> 00:23:18,856
I don't know, it's possible.

486
00:23:18,891 --> 00:23:20,044
If I was in Britain

487
00:23:20,097 --> 00:23:21,482
and saw a pickup truck
with a lawnmower,

488
00:23:21,506 --> 00:23:22,807
"I'll have that."

489
00:23:24,215 --> 00:23:27,638
Now, yesterday we went to erm...

490
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:29,802
It was like a big
classic-car museum,

491
00:23:29,872 --> 00:23:32,552
just out of town here, where you
could also buy the exhibits.

492
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,880
- It's great fun.
- It was a fantastic day out.

493
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,036
Really enjoyed ourselves
in there.

494
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,334
I mean, it was full
of, you know,

495
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:39,129
Mustangs and Camaros and stuff.

496
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,482
Stuff like this.
We've got a picture

497
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:42,616
of this sort of thing...
'60s and '70s stuff.

498
00:23:42,748 --> 00:23:46,376
Now, we know that cars like
this are horrible to drive.

499
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:48,879
Terrible. But they're
tremendous to look at.

500
00:23:48,934 --> 00:23:52,574
There was so much joy
in car design back then,

501
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:54,410
and you see it
in that car there.

502
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,762
It actually made us slightly
sad in a way, though,

503
00:23:56,825 --> 00:23:59,114
because as we were leaving, we
suddenly started wondering,

504
00:23:59,184 --> 00:24:01,309
"Well, what are they gonna
put in that museum

505
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,425
in 40 years' time?"

506
00:24:02,459 --> 00:24:03,400
- Yeah.
- What?

507
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:04,796
The Nissan-bloody-Juke.

508
00:24:04,882 --> 00:24:05,804
Exactly.

509
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:08,051
I don't want to look
at that now.

510
00:24:08,084 --> 00:24:10,326
No, exactly. Or the Dodge Dart.

511
00:24:10,426 --> 00:24:13,287
Well, what child's gonna
say, "Oh, Daddy!"

512
00:24:13,334 --> 00:24:16,560
Daddy, let's go and look at the
40-year-old Dart in the museum"?

513
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:17,912
Nobody is!

514
00:24:17,943 --> 00:24:19,248
It's true that car design

515
00:24:19,273 --> 00:24:20,536
has become so dreary lately.

516
00:24:20,637 --> 00:24:22,018
And I think part of it,

517
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:23,987
it's almost as if
the people who design cars

518
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,612
don't actually like
cars that much.

519
00:24:25,682 --> 00:24:27,515
Exactly. But they did then.
You can tell.

520
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:30,206
There was a Cuda in there
next to a Plymouth Fury,

521
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:33,093
and I just stood for about an
hour, just soaking them in.

522
00:24:33,203 --> 00:24:35,878
I saw a 1966 Cadillac.

523
00:24:35,944 --> 00:24:37,520
We've got a picture
of it here. Look.

524
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,245
Now, what I like about this

525
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,183
is that the bloke
who designed the bonnet,

526
00:24:41,223 --> 00:24:43,059
he... the grill. "I've finished
with the bonnet."

527
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:43,792
I'll do the grill."

528
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,460
But he didn't tell
the blokes doing the wings,

529
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,597
and they kept going, so it
goes like another foot.

530
00:24:48,706 --> 00:24:51,167
No, but this is fantastic
with a fantastic-looking car.

531
00:24:51,214 --> 00:24:53,269
The Buick Riviera, they had
one of those in there.

532
00:24:53,321 --> 00:24:55,097
- Look at that!
- That is glorious!

533
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:56,172
I had one of those

534
00:24:56,222 --> 00:24:57,605
as a toy when I was little.

535
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,480
If you put your finger
over the back window,

536
00:24:59,543 --> 00:25:01,112
it flashed its lights.

537
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:02,558
And you just look and you go,

538
00:25:02,611 --> 00:25:05,175
"How can Buick have gone
from doing that

539
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,261
"in, what, 30-40 years,
to doing this,

540
00:25:07,286 --> 00:25:09,112
whatever this brown..."
Look at...

541
00:25:09,644 --> 00:25:10,808
How have they done that?!

542
00:25:10,941 --> 00:25:12,480
And it's the same as Chevrolet.

543
00:25:12,534 --> 00:25:14,600
There was an Impala
in there, 1960.

544
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:17,193
Look at that!
That is exciting not moving!

545
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,487
That's a Chevy
Impala from the '60s.

546
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:21,167
Let's have a look at one
from today.

547
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,713
Oh, for God's sake!

548
00:25:22,925 --> 00:25:25,043
How do they even have the
nerve to call that an Impala?

549
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:25,935
Because it isn't one.

550
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,886
I was looking at a Corvette,

551
00:25:27,939 --> 00:25:28,987
a '70s Corvette.

552
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:30,138
That's the C3 model,

553
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:31,308
if you're a Corvette nerd.

554
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:32,568
This was a car that was driven

555
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,279
by all of the astronauts.

556
00:25:34,411 --> 00:25:36,847
- Exactly.
- And Dirk Diggler.

557
00:25:36,974 --> 00:25:38,114
Yep.

558
00:25:38,177 --> 00:25:39,825
Ah, so it's a car

559
00:25:39,851 --> 00:25:41,974
for porn stars and astronauts.

560
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:44,254
- What a strapline!
- What car is there today

561
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:46,239
that could be driven by
porn stars and astronauts?

562
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,358
- There isn't one.
- An Alfa!

563
00:25:48,418 --> 00:25:50,723
An Alfa?!

564
00:25:51,044 --> 00:25:53,072
Actually, he's right!

565
00:25:53,146 --> 00:25:55,932
No, astronauts
have to get there.

566
00:25:55,974 --> 00:25:57,372
He's right! That's exactly

567
00:25:57,397 --> 00:25:59,659
- what the Quadriplegio is!
- No!

568
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:02,741
This is for porn stars and astronauts,
which is what I am.

569
00:26:02,843 --> 00:26:04,307
Now, I would like to have

570
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:07,543
a conversation about
the Nürburgring.

571
00:26:07,772 --> 00:26:09,092
- Go on.
- Because this is important.

572
00:26:09,116 --> 00:26:10,646
Last year, I was delighted.

573
00:26:10,686 --> 00:26:12,475
The people who run
the Nürburgring in Germany,

574
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:15,285
they said they were gonna
ban car manufacturers

575
00:26:15,436 --> 00:26:17,327
from setting lap records there.

576
00:26:17,405 --> 00:26:19,889
Sorry, why were you
delighted about that?

577
00:26:19,943 --> 00:26:21,460
Because that's
an excellent idea.

578
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:23,968
If you make a car
that is excellent

579
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:25,537
for doing a fast lap
of the Nürburgring,

580
00:26:25,561 --> 00:26:28,164
it would be useless as a car
everywhere else in your life.

581
00:26:28,225 --> 00:26:30,405
It's like... It's like
setting your house up

582
00:26:30,444 --> 00:26:31,483
to play Laser Quest.

583
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:34,237
It will be brilliant
for playing Laser Quest,

584
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,617
but it'll be rubbish
for a dinner party

585
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:36,804
because it's full of lasers,

586
00:26:36,881 --> 00:26:38,530
darkness, fog
and music that goes...

587
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:40,554
and people running around

588
00:26:40,593 --> 00:26:41,953
thinking that they're
in Star Wars.

589
00:26:42,022 --> 00:26:43,413
Or you could get a dog...

590
00:26:43,491 --> 00:26:45,405
You could train a dog
as an attack dog,

591
00:26:45,407 --> 00:26:47,944
which is fantastic
if you own a scrapyard

592
00:26:48,022 --> 00:26:49,358
and you need
the dog to guard it,

593
00:26:49,386 --> 00:26:52,811
but take it home as a pet,
it will eat your children.

594
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:53,851
It's completely useless.

595
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:54,600
That's what happens

596
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,905
when you set a car up
for the Nürburgring.

597
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,741
This isn't really
a conversation, James.

598
00:26:58,813 --> 00:27:01,554
No, I think we've accidentally
turned down Rant Lane this week.

599
00:27:01,694 --> 00:27:02,990
Well, there's more.

600
00:27:03,014 --> 00:27:04,100
- He's off again.
- No, no.

601
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:06,602
But the thing is,
the bad news in all this

602
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:07,874
is that they've decided

603
00:27:07,939 --> 00:27:09,805
that they will allow
car manufacturers

604
00:27:09,835 --> 00:27:11,397
to set lap records again.

605
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:12,327
Well, that's good.

606
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,577
- No, it's bad!
- OK.

607
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:15,630
Think of the cars
that have come out recently

608
00:27:15,655 --> 00:27:17,044
that we've driven
that have been developed

609
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,877
so that they would go fast
around the Nürburgring.

610
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:20,802
BMW M4 GTS,

611
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:22,908
you can't deny it,
it's a terrible car.

612
00:27:22,963 --> 00:27:24,964
Nissan GT-R,
the Track Edition,

613
00:27:24,989 --> 00:27:26,522
that is a terrible car.

614
00:27:26,577 --> 00:27:29,874
Even SEAT...
the SEAT Leon Cupra 280,

615
00:27:29,968 --> 00:27:32,462
that's got a hatchback record for
going around the Nürburgring,

616
00:27:32,514 --> 00:27:33,530
and it's rubbish!

617
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:35,843
The Nürburgring ruins cars.

618
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:37,616
I'm developing an app
for the smart phone

619
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,002
called Bomb The Nürburgring

620
00:27:39,027 --> 00:27:40,894
where you guide
a Dornier 17 over it

621
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:42,448
and blow it up.

622
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:44,413
What are you doing
on this programme?

623
00:27:44,438 --> 00:27:45,694
Talking sense!

624
00:27:45,756 --> 00:27:47,557
Good question.
I don't know.

625
00:27:47,644 --> 00:27:50,513
We have this old woman who
has a baking show in Britain.

626
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:51,826
She's called Mary Berry.

627
00:27:51,912 --> 00:27:53,873
It would be...
You probably know her.

628
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:55,107
It's probably the same

629
00:27:55,162 --> 00:27:57,187
as her saying, "I hate cakes!"

630
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,162
Yes.

631
00:27:58,206 --> 00:27:59,552
Mary Berry would agree with me,

632
00:27:59,606 --> 00:28:01,200
because if she made a cake

633
00:28:01,232 --> 00:28:02,993
that had been developed
on the Nürburgring,

634
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:05,662
someone would put
fried onions on the top

635
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:07,724
and completely ruin it.
You'd have a Victoria sponge

636
00:28:07,748 --> 00:28:10,100
with onion on the top
for no reason!

637
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:11,677
James, you know
you're weird, don't you?

638
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:13,857
That's not weird. That's
the most sensible thing

639
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,224
that's ever been said
on this show.

640
00:28:15,248 --> 00:28:16,833
- You are weird.
- I'm not weird.

641
00:28:16,943 --> 00:28:18,880
He is weird! We were coming
through the airport

642
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,693
here the other day,
coming through Chicago,

643
00:28:20,771 --> 00:28:22,849
and he went,
"Jeremy, smell my jacket."

644
00:28:22,896 --> 00:28:24,029
He said what?!

645
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:25,169
- Yeah.
- He did.

646
00:28:25,224 --> 00:28:26,882
He said, "Smell my jacket."
I said, "Why?"

647
00:28:26,904 --> 00:28:29,352
He said, "Because it smells
of old record players."

648
00:28:29,412 --> 00:28:32,201
- Mate, that is weird.
- But it did!

649
00:28:32,466 --> 00:28:34,474
You know record players
don't smell of anything?

650
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:36,002
They do. Old ones do.

651
00:28:36,027 --> 00:28:37,396
They smell of old
record players.

652
00:28:37,474 --> 00:28:39,129
Who knows what they smell like?

653
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:40,662
- I'd like us...
- The decaying...

654
00:28:40,697 --> 00:28:42,032
I'd like us to move it on

655
00:28:42,037 --> 00:28:43,662
because it's getting scary now.

656
00:28:43,716 --> 00:28:45,099
That's not the record player!

657
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:46,716
We'll have another...
What are you on about?

658
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,260
Does anybody have
an old record player,

659
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:49,356
or anything old electrical?

660
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,404
They smell, don't they?

661
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,419
Has anybody ever smelled
an old record player?

662
00:28:52,451 --> 00:28:54,232
Really? You think you have?

663
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:56,079
You've smelled an old...

664
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:58,146
God, strewth!

665
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:02,615
Did it have a wax cylinder on
it, your old record player?

666
00:29:02,716 --> 00:29:05,419
They smell like old plastic
and warm rubber.

667
00:29:05,591 --> 00:29:06,661
Yeah, exactly.

668
00:29:06,724 --> 00:29:09,460
That smells like a party at James's house.
special... is that..

669
00:29:11,154 --> 00:29:13,716
You're actually talking
to Thomas Edison there.

670
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,700
In person.

671
00:29:17,818 --> 00:29:19,102
Well done, sir.

672
00:29:19,294 --> 00:29:20,578
Now, as we're told

673
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,466
almost every day
these days, really,

674
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:26,576
the world's coral reefs
are all dying.

675
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:29,591
And we're told that this
is the fault of the car.

676
00:29:29,646 --> 00:29:31,849
Well, since we host a car show,

677
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,460
we thought it would be
our duty and responsibility

678
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:36,396
to do something about it.

679
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,706
Here in the Caribbean,
all appears to be well.

680
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:49,765
But under
the shimmering blue sea,

681
00:29:49,862 --> 00:29:53,307
there's just miles
and miles of sand.

682
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,589
It's an underwater desert.

683
00:29:58,175 --> 00:30:00,050
And even when
you do find a reef,

684
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,104
most of the coral
is dead or dying.

685
00:30:07,143 --> 00:30:08,451
Thirty-eight years ago,

686
00:30:08,511 --> 00:30:10,386
the local government sank a ship

687
00:30:10,425 --> 00:30:13,448
to encourage the coral
to come back.

688
00:30:14,225 --> 00:30:16,003
And it's working.

689
00:30:16,227 --> 00:30:19,249
It's already an oasis of life.

690
00:30:21,165 --> 00:30:24,202
And that gave us an idea.

691
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:28,115
Why use a ship as the hub
or your coral reef?

692
00:30:28,171 --> 00:30:30,976
Why not use cars?
There are millions of them.

693
00:30:31,171 --> 00:30:33,585
So that's exactly what we've
done. We've got five cars.

694
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:35,445
And rather than go
through all the expense

695
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,347
and complication
of recycling them,

696
00:30:37,452 --> 00:30:39,366
we've stripped them,
taken the engines out,

697
00:30:39,476 --> 00:30:41,905
removed the paint, and they're
ready to go in the sea.

698
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,874
This really does
make perfect sense,

699
00:30:43,944 --> 00:30:45,811
because when the car
is in the water,

700
00:30:45,905 --> 00:30:46,921
it will start to corrode,

701
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:48,217
and that attracts all the things

702
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:49,796
that help the coral grow.

703
00:30:49,905 --> 00:30:51,861
And then the car itself
just rusts away

704
00:30:51,944 --> 00:30:53,363
to absolutely nothing.

705
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:55,046
So this one, which started life

706
00:30:55,124 --> 00:30:56,397
as a pretty horrible Peugeot

707
00:30:56,444 --> 00:30:57,780
and was always a terrible car,

708
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:01,046
will eventually become
a beautiful coral reef.

709
00:31:01,202 --> 00:31:03,296
And all this happens
quite quickly.

710
00:31:03,382 --> 00:31:04,616
So in just a few years' time,

711
00:31:04,694 --> 00:31:07,343
the BBC will be able to make
a wildlife documentary

712
00:31:07,444 --> 00:31:08,978
just in this wheel arch.

713
00:31:09,003 --> 00:31:10,335
Anyway, we've got the cars.

714
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,468
I've got a crane.

715
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:12,835
All we need now is a boat,

716
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:14,577
which is a job
we gave to Jeremy.

717
00:31:14,647 --> 00:31:16,007
That's his responsibility.

718
00:31:16,132 --> 00:31:17,538
He'll have overdone it,
won't he?

719
00:31:17,563 --> 00:31:19,258
Well, he'll have made a
statement of some sort, so...

720
00:31:19,282 --> 00:31:22,725
Freight ship.
Full-on freight ship.

721
00:31:22,773 --> 00:31:24,242
Or a tanker.

722
00:31:30,614 --> 00:31:34,887
♪♪

723
00:31:34,971 --> 00:31:36,639
Oh. He hasn't overdone it.

724
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,746
Is that him?

725
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,301
What is the point of that?

726
00:31:42,574 --> 00:31:44,515
Will you come and tie it up?

727
00:31:49,262 --> 00:31:52,129
That's the worst boat
I've ever seen. That's awful!

728
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:54,340
- What's the matter with it?
- Well, it...

729
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:57,473
We gave you $5,000
to buy a boat.

730
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,121
Boats are expensive!

731
00:31:59,228 --> 00:32:01,129
You didn't spend
all five grand on this.

732
00:32:01,232 --> 00:32:02,898
- That is not a five thou...
- Yes!

733
00:32:02,957 --> 00:32:04,551
I've got toothache. Be kind.

734
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:07,215
Irrelevant.
That is not a $5,000 boat.

735
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:09,038
- It is!
- It's barely a boat. Look at it!

736
00:32:09,081 --> 00:32:11,426
It's brilliant!
You'll get a car on this.

737
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:13,762
- Er... Where?
- On the back!

738
00:32:13,863 --> 00:32:15,645
- Who did you buy it from?
- A man.

739
00:32:15,646 --> 00:32:17,848
- Was he laughing?
- No, he wasn't.

740
00:32:17,957 --> 00:32:19,856
- Can I come aboard?
- No.

741
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,220
I don't think it can take two.

742
00:32:21,246 --> 00:32:23,519
Look! It's terrible!

743
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:25,470
Instead of just standing there,

744
00:32:25,502 --> 00:32:27,697
criticising a man
who's got toothache,

745
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:31,294
why don't you go and get
a car on the crane

746
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:33,517
and start loading it?

747
00:32:34,831 --> 00:32:39,306
Soon, our first car was ready
to be lifted onto the boat.

748
00:32:40,197 --> 00:32:42,348
It's just nice to be putting
something back, really.

749
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:44,439
It genuinely is.
It's a little old Corsa,

750
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:46,080
and it's gonna be full of coral.

751
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:47,767
Mr Coral coming, swimming along.

752
00:32:47,845 --> 00:32:49,095
"Ooh, there's something
to latch on to."

753
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,299
Then his friend comes along.

754
00:32:50,377 --> 00:32:51,595
His friend comes along.

755
00:32:51,767 --> 00:32:53,127
This is a genuinely
brilliant idea.

756
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:55,117
That doesn't fill me with...

757
00:32:55,283 --> 00:32:56,352
total confidence.

That. Yeah, that.

763
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:15,564

That's to release it,
you Muppet!

780
00:33:51,342 --> 00:33:52,990
Well, I thought
it was a guide rope.

781

No, I steer it! You just
release it when it's on there!

He said,
"Pull the rope to steer it."

This is a £400,000 crane!

785
00:34:01,857 --> 00:34:03,692
Why would you steer it
with a piece of string?!

786
00:34:03,716 --> 00:34:05,076
It's got all these
knobs and buttons.

What if we just said
we only had four cars?

791
00:34:18,226 --> 00:34:20,570
So we've taken four cars,
removed the engines

792
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,733
and the paint, and they're ready
to go in the sea.

793
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:25,575
- We'll do that piece to camera again.
- Yeah, yeah.

794
00:34:25,694 --> 00:34:28,538
The thing is, why use a ship
as the hub of your reef?

795
00:34:28,624 --> 00:34:30,554
Why not use cars?
There are millions.

796
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:33,835
So we've taken four cars,
removed the engines,

797

stripped them down and they're
ready to go in the sea.

Oh, yeah.

799

And then... And then,

800
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,991
this Peugeot
was no good as a car,

801
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:46,396
but will be... but the coral
will just stick to it,

802
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,063
oxidising and algae.

803
00:34:48,147 --> 00:34:49,491
Doesn't take very long.

Yeah, from just four cars.
That's all we had.

806
00:34:54,616 --> 00:34:56,572
Four cars. That's all
you need for a reef.

807
00:34:56,663 --> 00:34:58,351
Right, here's the boat
we've selected.

808
00:34:58,393 --> 00:34:59,695
It's a little bit damaged.

809
00:35:01,663 --> 00:35:03,312
With the release rope stowed,

810
00:35:03,429 --> 00:35:06,030
we managed to get
the first of our four cars

811
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:10,124
onto the boat, which had
come with a broken roof.

812
00:35:11,216 --> 00:35:13,106
Yeah. Oh, yes!

813
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:15,405
- Yes!
- Yeah!

814
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:18,193
Good! Result.

815
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:21,608
And then we had to
secure it in place.

816
00:35:23,476 --> 00:35:25,851
I don't understand
ratchet straps.

817
00:35:25,952 --> 00:35:29,046
Er... There's water
coming into the boat.

818
00:35:29,072 --> 00:35:32,265
- No, there was some in when I bought it.
- It's leaking.

819
00:35:32,437 --> 00:35:34,741
There's always a bit of water
in the bilges.

820
00:35:34,827 --> 00:35:36,874
It's why boats have bilge pumps.

821
00:35:36,976 --> 00:35:38,714
No, it's coming in.

822
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:41,702
It's not just like it's in,
it's coming in.

823
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:43,827
- Well, there's none here.
- There's holes! It's leaking!

824
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:47,569
Oh, shit! No, there is!
Well, attach us to the crane.

825
00:35:47,624 --> 00:35:49,459
Er...
It's gone down.

826
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,491
It has gone...
It is going down.

827
00:35:51,562 --> 00:35:53,171
If you attach us
to the crane,

828
00:35:53,272 --> 00:35:54,564
it won't sink, will it?

829
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:55,991
We're tied on.

830
00:35:56,069 --> 00:35:58,843
James, can you
just take the slack?

831
00:35:59,905 --> 00:36:01,737
Sadly, James misunderstood

00:36:01,796 --> 00:36:03,358
this simple instruction.

833
00:36:03,616 --> 00:36:05,116
Oh, the whole thing

834
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:06,476
has collapsed at the back!

835
00:36:06,477 --> 00:36:07,810
Oh, dear God!

836
00:36:07,944 --> 00:36:09,712
Wait! Stop!
Whoa! Whoa! What?

837
00:36:09,796 --> 00:36:10,991
It's falling over!

838
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:12,733
James, it's falling!

839
00:36:12,783 --> 00:36:14,272
- What do you want?
- Holy Mother of God!

840
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:17,772
It's going down!
Abandon ship! Save yourself!

841
00:36:21,453 --> 00:36:22,986
Catch it, James!

842
00:36:23,026 --> 00:36:24,640
Save it!

843
00:36:24,795 --> 00:36:25,897
Stop!

844
00:36:26,007 --> 00:36:27,858
What are you doing?

845
00:36:27,998 --> 00:36:29,601
Oh, God.

846
00:36:29,766 --> 00:36:31,749
The French Secret Service

847
00:36:31,868 --> 00:36:35,397
didn't do a job as good as this.

848
00:36:35,506 --> 00:36:37,139
I'm not talking
to any of you.

849
00:36:37,226 --> 00:36:39,015
No. Come on,
it was May's fault.

850
00:36:39,075 --> 00:36:40,510
You bought a crap boat,

851
00:36:40,554 --> 00:36:42,488
you put an idiot spaniel
on the crane,

852
00:36:42,513 --> 00:36:44,514
and, also, think
what we were gonna do

853
00:36:44,546 --> 00:36:45,881
for the conception of the car.

854
00:36:45,968 --> 00:36:47,522
People would love the car.
They would see it

855
00:36:47,546 --> 00:36:50,720
as a friendly,
coral-loving thing.

856
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:52,327
You're swimming

857
00:36:52,366 --> 00:36:54,749
I don't like being
in the bloody water!

858
00:36:54,825 --> 00:36:59,663
Fact! I'm not comfortable!
I'm from Birmingham!

859
00:36:59,796 --> 00:37:02,031
Having sunk a boat and two cars

860
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:04,133
where the cruise liners
normally park,

861
00:37:04,218 --> 00:37:09,077
the port authorities
suggested we go away.

862
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:11,507
So we took
our three remaining cars

863
00:37:11,593 --> 00:37:13,060
to a nearby marina,

864
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:14,774
built ourselves a raft,

865
00:37:14,897 --> 00:37:16,093
and hired a boat

866
00:37:16,157 --> 00:37:18,429
which had a crane on the front.

867
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:23,921
- May!
- What?

868
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:26,124

00:45:52,086 --> 00:45:53,758
- Here he comes!
- Oh, there he is!

1042
00:45:53,829 --> 00:45:56,587
- There he is.
- The man himself. What a legend!

1043
00:45:56,688 --> 00:45:59,165
I can't... I've always wanted
to meet him. I'm thrilled.

1044
00:45:59,211 --> 00:46:01,184
- Yeah.
- That is a legend. Proper...

1045
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:02,692
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hello.

1046
00:46:02,785 --> 00:46:03,872
- What?
- Oh, my...

1047
00:46:05,675 --> 00:46:06,975
Oh, God!

1048
00:46:09,652 --> 00:46:12,457
- We killed him.
- We've killed Brian Johnson.

1049
00:46:12,608 --> 00:46:14,324
That's...

1050
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,668
OK.

1051
00:46:16,952 --> 00:46:18,637
Brian Johnson has been run over

1052
00:46:18,715 --> 00:46:21,731
by some people who think
they are playing football.

1053
00:46:21,801 --> 00:46:23,892
- But they're not.
- It's not football, is it?

1054
00:46:23,934 --> 00:46:25,134
Cos they don't use their feet.

1055
00:46:25,225 --> 00:46:27,043
That's not football.

1056
00:46:27,176 --> 00:46:29,402
That's just people dressing up.

1057
00:46:30,966 --> 00:46:32,367
- That's...
- We play football.

1058
00:46:32,392 --> 00:46:34,621
- We play football.
- Yeah, with our feet.

1059
00:46:34,949 --> 00:46:36,457
We play football.

1060
00:46:36,645 --> 00:46:37,916
- Soccer! It's soccer!
- What?!

1061
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,817
It's not soccer!
It's football that we play!

1062
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:44,660
It's 6.75 billion people in
the world call it football!

1063
00:46:46,035 --> 00:46:47,746
You can moan and shout
all you like.

1064
00:46:47,832 --> 00:46:49,752
The fact is, we're British
and we edit this show,

1065
00:46:49,824 --> 00:46:51,120
and you'll just get cut out.

1066
00:46:51,246 --> 00:46:52,647
You will.

1067
00:46:53,423 --> 00:46:55,190
This is a rugby ball!

1068
00:46:55,254 --> 00:46:56,391
Look on the screen.

1069
00:46:56,473 --> 00:46:57,645
They're only playing

1070
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:00,004
with the padding
they were born with!

1071
00:47:00,262 --> 00:47:01,754
This is not a football!

1072
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:03,698
They call it football.

1073
00:47:07,603 --> 00:47:11,841
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!

1074
00:47:14,411 --> 00:47:15,615
So...

1075
00:47:15,701 --> 00:47:18,755
Brian Johnson
has been run over by erm...

1076
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:21,883
some supremely brave
and talented footballers.

1077
00:47:26,923 --> 00:47:28,900
Er...

1078
00:47:29,228 --> 00:47:31,197
Does that mean
he's not coming on, then?

1079
00:47:31,261 --> 00:47:33,275
Well, James, he's been hammered

1080
00:47:33,345 --> 00:47:34,517
to the thickness of an envelope

1081
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:37,332
and his spine is now
a jigsaw, so that is a no.

1082
00:47:37,392 --> 00:47:38,727
Fine.

1083
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:41,127
Right, so what are we
gonna do to fill the time?

1084
00:47:41,171 --> 00:47:42,033
I've got nothing.

1085
00:47:42,064 --> 00:47:43,015
We could get back

1086
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,103
to our important
marine biology work.

1087
00:47:45,202 --> 00:47:46,845
- Plan. Do it.
- Yes, let's do that.

1088
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,386
So when we left the action,

1089
00:47:48,486 --> 00:47:50,579
erm... I'd successfully

1090
00:47:50,681 --> 00:47:52,923
welded two cars to the seabed,

1091
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,205
and that was good.

1092
00:47:54,259 --> 00:47:57,061
Yeah, and we pick up
the action the next day,

1093
00:47:57,158 --> 00:47:59,589
as we go back to finish the job.

1094
00:47:59,613 --> 00:48:02,946
♪♪

1095
00:48:03,055 --> 00:48:04,977
On our way
to get the last car,

1096
00:48:05,042 --> 00:48:06,470
we stopped at the reef site

1097
00:48:06,518 --> 00:48:09,055
to make sure everything was OK.

1098
00:48:10,484 --> 00:48:12,087
Tom Daley!

1099
00:48:19,161 --> 00:48:20,794
I don't like it.

1100
00:48:20,843 --> 00:48:22,445
Oh. Oh.

1101
00:48:25,548 --> 00:48:28,101
And after a few moments
in the water,

1102
00:48:28,218 --> 00:48:31,019
we discovered it wasn't.

1103
00:48:31,044 --> 00:48:34,166
Where the bloody hell
are they? There's the buoy.

1104
00:48:34,224 --> 00:48:35,859
This is the wrong place.

1105
00:48:35,953 --> 00:48:37,734
Yes,
that marks the spot.

1106
00:48:37,851 --> 00:48:39,470
They're just not here.

1107
00:48:39,554 --> 00:48:42,640
Why did we trust you
to fix them in place?

1108
00:48:42,665 --> 00:48:44,899
- I didn't... Listen.
- Of all people.

1109
00:48:44,937 --> 00:48:46,195
Well, I don't understand it,

1110
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,882
cos I don't normally
make a mess of...

1111
00:48:48,961 --> 00:48:50,588
Oh, you must have made
a good job of it.

1112
00:48:50,613 --> 00:48:51,844
That's why they've gone!

1113
00:48:51,976 --> 00:48:54,203
There is evidence,
or a lack of it,

1114
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:55,733
to suggest you can't weld.

1115
00:48:55,758 --> 00:48:57,412
- Oh, shit.
- Maybe a shark...

1116
00:48:57,413 --> 00:48:59,481
- Er...
- What?

1117
00:48:59,711 --> 00:49:01,562
- What?
- Look.

1118
00:49:01,927 --> 00:49:03,445
Oh, brilliant!

1119
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:05,280
How the hell
did they do that, though?

1120
00:49:05,367 --> 00:49:07,929
You know this current
that's whizzing us about?

1121
00:49:08,023 --> 00:49:10,664
Look at them! They're not
gonna make a reef, are they?!

1122
00:49:10,819 --> 00:49:12,656
Well, maybe... it could be

1123
00:49:12,695 --> 00:49:14,765
like a play area
for the privileged.

1124
00:49:14,824 --> 00:49:15,937
Some rusty cars?

1125
00:49:15,962 --> 00:49:16,944
That doesn't
work, does it?

1126
00:49:16,969 --> 00:49:18,359
No.

1127
00:49:18,383 --> 00:49:21,446
♪♪

1128
00:49:21,471 --> 00:49:23,605
Obviously,
we had to retrieve them,

1129
00:49:23,648 --> 00:49:25,281
which meant moving the raft

1130
00:49:25,341 --> 00:49:28,109
to the stern of our crane boat.

1131
00:49:29,672 --> 00:49:31,304
James,
have you untied that end?

1132
00:49:31,381 --> 00:49:35,398
Yeah. Get ready to catch
this rope. Here we go.

1133
00:49:35,914 --> 00:49:38,265
Pull it along a bit and get
it sort of squared up.

1134
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,788
I'll have a nice ride.

1135
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:42,476
Right.
Repositioning raft.

1136
00:49:44,664 --> 00:49:46,528
That's a reassuring noise.

1137
00:49:46,648 --> 00:49:50,508
Er... Where...
Where's that come from?

1138
00:49:50,711 --> 00:49:52,066
James. James.

1139
00:49:52,195 --> 00:49:53,734
- What?
- What's that doing over there?

1140
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:54,844
What's what doing?

1141
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,719
All this bamboo's come off.

1142
00:49:56,883 --> 00:49:58,320
What have you untied?

1143
00:49:58,374 --> 00:50:00,609
I've untied the piece
of string at the front.

1144
00:50:00,656 --> 00:50:04,846
But, look, half the craft
is disappearing.

1145
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:07,982
As the raft
was disintegrating fast,

1146
00:50:08,148 --> 00:50:10,752
we had to get it
to shore quickly.

1147
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:13,156
Firing up the machine!

1148
00:50:15,248 --> 00:50:17,883
Sadly, though,
Jeremy's turn of speed

1149
00:50:18,072 --> 00:50:19,891
only made things worse.

1150
00:50:19,959 --> 00:50:22,126
Power! Power! Come on!

1151
00:50:22,197 --> 00:50:23,499
Slow down!

1152
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,857
It's falling apart!

1153
00:50:27,169 --> 00:50:29,505
- Look, he's going down!
- Slow down!

1154
00:50:29,687 --> 00:50:32,156
Slow!

1155
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:42,584
You can't put cars
on that, can you?

1156
00:50:43,278 --> 00:50:45,435
After we'd rescued James,

1157
00:50:45,521 --> 00:50:48,068
he stupidly suggested that,
to solve the problem,

1158
00:50:48,216 --> 00:50:50,802
we should ruin
everyone's holiday.

1159
00:51:00,866 --> 00:51:03,624
I think these people
should move out of the way.

1160
00:51:03,819 --> 00:51:06,808
My plan was to tow the cars
off the beach

1161
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:10,379
and back to the harbour
so we could start again.

1162
00:51:10,546 --> 00:51:14,444
Which meant I'd need the help
of the man from Atlantis.

1163
00:51:14,694 --> 00:51:17,486
Hold my hand! There! There!
There! Now, let me go.

1164
00:51:17,487 --> 00:51:19,130
Yeah, that's me.
You have to let...

1165
00:51:19,169 --> 00:51:22,223
Oh, mind my arm!
Let me go now. I'm fine.

1166
00:51:22,504 --> 00:51:23,903
I don't like it!

1167
00:51:27,805 --> 00:51:29,440
Move!

1168
00:51:36,776 --> 00:51:40,323
Hammond, tie both of them to
this and give me a thumbs up.

1169
00:51:40,432 --> 00:51:42,346
If James gets those
onto the road,

1170
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,120
all the way back up to
the harbour,

1171
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:47,682
build another raft,
get them loaded on...

1172
00:51:47,846 --> 00:51:50,768
bring them back,
it's gonna take days.

1173
00:51:54,034 --> 00:51:56,143
- OK.
- Don't stand near the back.

1174
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:57,878
The brakes don't work.

1175
00:52:00,589 --> 00:52:02,258
Yeah!

1176
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:17,946
- Well, now what?
- That was rubbish.

1177
00:52:19,194 --> 00:52:21,883
I then said we should
use my brilliant boat

1178
00:52:21,936 --> 00:52:24,553
to tow the cars back
to the reef site,

1179
00:52:24,687 --> 00:52:27,389
which would be quicker
and easier.

1180
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:35,225
They're in the water!

1181
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:39,251
Ha-ha! Power!

1182
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:40,931
Power! Come on!

1183
00:52:42,856 --> 00:52:44,290
Yes!

1184
00:52:44,474 --> 00:52:47,176
Eat my boat, James May!

1185
00:52:50,145 --> 00:52:51,279
Come on!

1186
00:52:55,159 --> 00:52:57,495
Victory is the boat's!

1187
00:53:00,355 --> 00:53:03,081
James May's hopeless plan...

1188
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:05,800
What was that?

1189
00:53:07,663 --> 00:53:10,511
With two rusty Peugeots
in his swimming area

1190
00:53:10,566 --> 00:53:12,768
and his beach furniture
in ruins,

1191
00:53:12,902 --> 00:53:15,097
the hotel manager had had enough

1192
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,979
and ordered us to leave.

1193
00:53:18,774 --> 00:53:22,911
We'd now lost four cars,
a boat and our raft.

1194
00:53:23,183 --> 00:53:26,292
But on the plus side,
we still had one car left,

1195
00:53:26,401 --> 00:53:29,784
and most importantly,
the crane boat.

1196
00:53:30,612 --> 00:53:33,534
But that night,
there was bad news.

1197
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,479
The man who owns it
is not best pleased with us.

1198
00:53:41,745 --> 00:53:44,609
- Because?
- He has off-hired it.

1199
00:53:44,737 --> 00:53:47,536
- We've not got the crane boat?
- No.

1200
00:53:47,698 --> 00:53:51,015
- That was the most useful thing we had.
- Yeah.

1201
00:53:51,128 --> 00:53:54,909
So what can we possibly do
with a Land Rover?

1202
00:53:55,206 --> 00:53:57,425
- Well...
- Well, what?

1203
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,136
If I can be positive...

1204
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:01,511
The Land Rover's
largely aluminium,

1205
00:54:01,659 --> 00:54:03,995
which is actually even better
for creating a reef.

1206
00:54:04,124 --> 00:54:05,659
- True.
- But it's on the land!

1207
00:54:05,766 --> 00:54:08,034
Yes, it is true.
The Land Rover is...

1208
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,979
It's irrelevant.
We've lost everything else.

1209
00:54:10,027 --> 00:54:12,534
Yes, but it's good if...

1210
00:54:14,564 --> 00:54:16,042
I've had a brainwave.

1211
00:54:16,326 --> 00:54:17,761
Oh, God.

1212
00:54:20,612 --> 00:54:22,580
And so, the next morning,

1213
00:54:22,605 --> 00:54:24,565
the people of Barbados
were treated

1214
00:54:24,608 --> 00:54:26,342
to the magnificent spectacle

1215
00:54:26,641 --> 00:54:29,109
of a Land Rover
gliding majestically

1216
00:54:29,187 --> 00:54:30,859
on a bed of inner tubes

1217
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:33,582
across the Caribbean Sea.

1218
00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:36,438
Here we are on our final car,
and it's a classic.

1219
00:54:36,602 --> 00:54:38,063
It's a Series I Land Rover.

1220
00:54:38,102 --> 00:54:39,602
No, it's a Series II.

1221
00:54:39,722 --> 00:54:41,602
It's a Series I. The lights
are close together.

1222
00:54:41,664 --> 00:54:43,457
No, it's got the barrel
rolls on the doors.

1223
00:54:43,507 --> 00:54:44,750
It's a Series II.

1224
00:54:44,827 --> 00:54:46,438
- That makes it a Series II?
- Yeah.

1225
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,274
I thought Series Ils
had the lights angled.

1226
00:54:48,406 --> 00:54:49,806
I think we're getting
stuck on this.

1227
00:54:49,899 --> 00:54:51,789
- It's a Land Rover.
- It's an old Land Rover.

1228
00:54:51,852 --> 00:54:52,938
The good thing about it is

1229
00:54:53,038 --> 00:54:55,070
it corrodes much less
quickly than the steel car.

1230
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,914
We've also glued these limestone
tiles to it,

1231
00:54:57,984 --> 00:55:01,953
because porous limestone is
the perfect base, foundation,

1232
00:55:02,102 --> 00:55:03,617
for coral to start a reef.

1233
00:55:03,789 --> 00:55:06,766
This is a coral-reef-making
machine.

1234
00:55:07,016 --> 00:55:10,051
In fact, the only fly
in the ointment

1235
00:55:10,195 --> 00:55:12,953
was its propulsion system.

1236
00:55:13,156 --> 00:55:15,790
- Can I go a bit faster?
- No!

1237
00:55:15,891 --> 00:55:17,926
It's filling with
water the faster you go.

1238
00:55:17,927 --> 00:55:19,360
We'll sink it
in the wrong place.

1239
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:22,797
This is our last car,
our last chance.

1240
00:55:23,148 --> 00:55:25,875
They're bleating on.
"Oh, don't go too fast!"

1241
00:55:26,015 --> 00:55:28,637
You're going faster
again, Jeremy!

1242
00:55:28,851 --> 00:55:30,601
You're pulling it under!

1243
00:55:31,173 --> 00:55:32,445
Relax!

1244
00:55:32,647 --> 00:55:34,382
Am I
the same species as that?

1245
00:55:34,407 --> 00:55:35,267
No.

1246
00:55:35,307 --> 00:55:37,687
Jeremy, don't sink it

1247
00:55:37,726 --> 00:55:39,548
before we get there!

1248
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:42,026
Mother of God!
Have you seen that?

1249
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,652
- What?
- Guys, look!

00:55:43,868 --> 00:55:46,856

- Holy cow! Look at it!

1251

That is phenomenal!

Yeah! Racing!

sink us! Don't race it!

Thank you so much.

for helping us with that film.

1322
00:59:50,784 --> 00:59:53,807
And we'd just like to say
no coral was damaged

1323
00:59:53,893 --> 00:59:55,346
while we were building our reef.

1324
00:59:55,456 --> 00:59:59,190
No. Or, if we're
perfectly honest, created.

1325
00:59:59,385 --> 01:00:01,342
However, we came back
with a brilliant idea.

1326
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,111
You see, we liked it
in the Caribbean.

1327

You know, our crews liked it
in the Caribbean.

1328
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:07,393
So we thought it would be
a good idea, next week,

1329
01:00:07,456 --> 01:00:08,385
to make a film

1330
01:00:08,417 --> 01:00:11,119
comparing the motoring
cultures of the French,

1331
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,534
the Dutch
and the British Islands.

1332
01:00:12,621 --> 01:00:14,627
- Yeah, it was a great idea.
- Brilliant idea.

1333
01:00:14,664 --> 01:00:16,002
But Mr Wilman, our producer,

1334
01:00:16,058 --> 01:00:17,932
he decided it wasn't
a brilliant idea,

1335
01:00:17,957 --> 01:00:18,909
and that, instead,

1336
01:00:18,979 --> 01:00:21,354
we should go to northern
France with three old cars

1337
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:23,414
and drive around in the rain.

1338
01:00:23,854 --> 01:00:25,299
So that's what
we're actually doing.

1339
01:00:25,346 --> 01:00:27,510
And on that terrible
disappointment, it's time to end.

1340
01:00:27,581 --> 01:00:29,135
Thank you so much for watching.

1341
