1
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:06,534
Greetings. Thank you.

2
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,607
Thank you so much.

3
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,944
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you so much.

4
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:18,879
Thank you, thank you.

5
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,584
Welcome to The Grand Tour.
And in this week's programme:

6
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,155
I drive a saloon car.

7
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:33,527
James drives
a catering lorry.

8
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,698
And Richard
has a knife fight.

9
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,667
Let's dance.

10
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:43,704
That is all to come,
but first of all,

11
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,774
let me talk you through where
we are. It's South Africa.

12
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:50,077
Over there, in the distance,
you can see Johannesburg.

13
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:54,782
But this place here is called
The Cradle of Humankind.

14
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,818
Now it's called that
because archaeologists
have determined

15
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:03,191
it was on this very spot
that mankind separated
from the ape.

16
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:05,459
Ahem.

17
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,063
Well, I mean...

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,202
See? We haven't even begun.

19
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:15,569
- What?
- Be reasonable.

20
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,005
You've learnt to put socks on,

21
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,540
but other than that, mate...

22
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,575
Listen, I'm trying to be
profound here, OK?

23
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,511
- Carry on, carry on.
- I'm trying to be profound.

24
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:25,246
Because this is ground zero.

25
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:27,748
This is where all
of human history began.

26
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:31,319
Anyone who comes here,
it's like coming home.

27
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,221
- Jeremy.
- What?

28
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:36,624
How long has it taken some of
us to evolve from being apes?

29
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,926
It's taken

30
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:42,230
two million and a hundred...

31
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:53,474
You at home may be
wondering why everybody
here is applauding,

32
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,979
but it's because
while the rest of mankind

33
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,716
has managed to grasp
the concept of arithmetic,

34
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,753
the President of South
Africa, Jacob Zuma...

35
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:07,855
Well, how can I put this?
He sort of hasn't.

36
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,924
I've got a clip here to show
you what I'm on about.

37
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:15,596
We announce that our
membership figures

38
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:21,134
stood at...769,

39
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,970
eight-hundred and...

40
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,174
700...

41
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,444
Listen properly.

42
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:35,783
769 thousand,

43
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:38,786
820...

44
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,295
I mean, honestly.

45
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,198
The funny thing is...

46
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:54,668
Jacob Zuma is a bit of
a controversial figure here.

47
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,305
He recently installed a
swimming pool at his home.

48
00:03:57,305 --> 00:04:00,974
And then, because he'd used
taxpayers' money to do that,

49
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:05,746
he said it was actually
a water storage facility
in case of a fire.

50
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,649
So, in other words,
if he burst into flames,

51
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,784
he can jump into it
and put himself out

52
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:15,122
in ten hundred and...
three hundred...seconds.

53
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,357
He has also bought himself

54
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:18,125
what he claims
is a fire engine.

55
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,927
Nice.

56
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:23,431
He's also got himself
an ambulance.

57
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:26,534
Yep. Can't be too careful.

58
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:28,836
Motoring in South Africa.

59
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:31,171
Big problem here, of course,
is the wildlife,

60
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,874
because how do you
accurately warn motorists

61
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:36,510
that there may be
a deer-y thing ahead

62
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,912
and it could be
full of helium?

63
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:41,715
Well, the authorities
have had a go.

64
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,617
They've come up with
this as a sign.

65
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:47,187
It's not bad, except
they've got the word wrong.

66
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:52,092
What?

67
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,494
It's wrong, isn't it?

68
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,195
- It's not baboons.
- No, it's not.

69
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,898
We're from England.
We know that's not a baboon.

70
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,202
Baboons are actually
very dangerous here.

71
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,173
Certainly,
they've got a better idea

72
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:09,242
of how to handle a gun
than the local police.

73
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:14,848
He's actually using that
as a shooting stick.

74
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,817
Shall we get on
with the show?

75
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,387
- Yes, good idea. Good plan.
- Yes, let's.

76
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:20,854
And we start
with Aston Martin.

77
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,223
The company must have had
a meeting recently

78
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,725
and the bosses
must have said,

79
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,059
"It's gonna be
a few years now

80
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,761
"until the next
Bond film is out,

81
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,797
"so what are we gonna do
at Aston Martin

82
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:32,032
to generate some headlines
in the meantime?"

83
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,934
And what they must
have decided is,

84
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,203
to make a car that is
as good as a car can be.

85
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,472
They weren't talking
about making a racing car

86
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:39,707
because in racing
there are rules

87
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:41,509
about how big
the engine can be

88
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,110
and what sort of tyres
you can use.

89
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,978
And they weren't talking
about making a road car,

90
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,881
that would have to meet
emissions regulations,

91
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,451
have comfy rubber bits
in the suspension.

92
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:52,085
And all that stuff
would slow it down.

93
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,754
Exactly. They wanted
to make a car

94
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,424
that adhered to no rules
and no regulations.

95
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:58,492
So they have.

96
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,438
This is what
they came up with.

97
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:20,448
It costs £1.8 million.

98
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,084
And it's called the Vulcan.

99
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:28,789
Spectacular, isn't it?

100
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,729
But not very practical.

101
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:57,084
Oh, God. Ow!

102
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,052
Agh!

103
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,392
Hold on... Nope.

104
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:08,295
How are you...?

105
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,497
No.

106
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:11,131
Agh!

107
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,867
Now I'm totally stuck.

108
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,270
Oh, yeah.

109
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,709
You will be able to edit
this out, won't you?

110
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,677
I don't want people
thinking I'm fat.

111
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,115
Right. I'm gonna pop it
into gear now.

112
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,518
You may hear this
a little bit.

113
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,591
Good. First.

114
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,893
Er...foot on clutch.

115
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:44,698
And now it's time to fire up
the seven-litre V12.

116
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,918
It's quite normal.

117
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:20,167
When I got going, things
didn't get much better.

118
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:28,341
Even at slow speeds,
it is quite loud in here,

119
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,645
which is why I'm wearing
this silly face microphone

120
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:34,715
so you can hear
what I'm on about.

121
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:39,119
The noisiest part
of this car, however,
is not the engine.

122
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,095
That's the brakes.

123
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:52,099
They are quite...
They are quite squeaky.

124
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:59,607
It actually sounds like
I'm stamping on a piglet.

125
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:05,613
And things get worse
when you put your foot down.

126
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:14,021
I'm not going to say
that it's like

127
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:17,224
being attacked
by a bear because it isn't.

128
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,661
But it is like being
in a room with a bear

129
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:23,631
that's thinking
of attacking you.

130
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:28,802
At the moment I've turned the
engine down on this knob here

131
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,638
to its minimum setting.

132
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:33,907
It's only producing
500 horsepower.

133
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,979
So it's not really
the speed that's scary.

134
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,714
Oh, God!

135
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,216
It's the noise
and the harshness

136
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,252
and the vibrations.

137
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,492
It's not a very well-equipped
car either.

138
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,528
The windows don't wind down,
for instance.

139
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,698
There are no toys at all.

140
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:01,001
And you only get
half a steering wheel.

141
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:07,107
However, there is
one amazing thing

142
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,010
you get for
your £1.8 million.

143
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,181
An all-expenses-paid trip to
a racetrack of your choice,

144
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,016
where an Aston Martin
test driver

145
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,318
will teach you
how to drive your car,

146
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:21,755
not with the engine wound
down to 500 horsepower,

147
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:24,624
but with it turned up...

148
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,326
...to the max.

149
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,774
Holy cow! Ha-ha-ha!

150
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:50,050
The engine is now
producing 820 horsepower.

151
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,654
And the speed
just beggars belief.

152
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:58,191
The bear is in attack mode.

153
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,199
The figures say it'll do
0-60 in 2.9 seconds.

154
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:11,271
And has a top speed of 208
with that wing on the back.

155
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,775
But it feels a hell of a lot
faster than that.

156
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:17,010
Oh, God!

157
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,987
The other thing
you get for your money

158
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,789
is a squadron of mechanics.

159
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,462
But sadly... not a handbrake.

160
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,299
Right, what I've done now
is I've taken... yes...

161
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,634
I've taken the
steering wheel off,

162
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,772
so I can't put it in gear
to stop it rolling away.

163
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:48,375
Oh, God.

164
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,510
Agh.

165
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,445
Argh, argh...

166
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,218
When I'd finally
got it to stop,

167
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:03,056
the jacks were deployed and
the mechanics set to work.

168
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,592
That's the thing
about the Vulcan.

169
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:08,361
Wing angle, roll bar,
suspension, brakes.

170
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:13,801
Everything can be adjusted
to suit your personal taste.

171
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:17,070
After ten minutes
of pretending I knew
what they were doing,

172
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,339
I was back on the track.

173
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:27,948
And the car felt...
just as bonkers
as it had done before.

174
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:33,220
However, I've changed.

175
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,357
I've been driving
this thing now,

176
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,259
I don't know,
three or four hours,

177
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,295
and I'm starting to...
understand it.

178
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,097
I'm starting to
get used to it.

179
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,835
I'm starting to trust it.

180
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:52,039
Now I'm starting
to understand...

181
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,907
why the Vulcan can go round

182
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:57,244
the Nardo handling circuit
in southern Italy

183
00:12:57,244 --> 00:13:02,850
nine seconds faster
than the McLaren P1.

184
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,420
Nine seconds in car time,
that's a year!

185
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,895
You get phenomenal
mechanical grip

186
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,864
in the low-speed corners,

187
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,631
and then,
on the Isn't Straight,

188
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,201
you've got a ton-and-a-half
of downforce,

189
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,336
thanks to its aerodynamics.

190
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:31,078
Then you have the power
from the engine,

191
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:34,882
which feels,
well, old-fashioned.

192
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,416
Proper.

193
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,652
I'm surprised it
doesn't have carburettors.

194
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,390
I love this thing very much.

195
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,662
And what I love most of all

196
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,798
is that it's not a test bed.

197
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:55,903
It's not an example
of what cars will be like
in the future.

198
00:13:55,903 --> 00:14:00,140
It's a celebration of what
they were like in the past.

199
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,911
What it is...

200
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:06,079
is old time rock'n'roll.

201
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:13,220
Thank you, thank you.

202
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,422
Thank you very much.

203
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,393
- So...
- What?

204
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,662
I get the impression
you quite liked the car.

205
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,431
Oh, it's unbelievable.

206
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:26,499
What I loved most of all is
they've made it out of bits

207
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,601
that they already had
lying around in the factory.

208
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,103
It's like you going home

209
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,939
after your tripto South Africa,
opening the fridge,

210
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:33,273
and using what's there

211
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,208
to make a delicious
shepherd's pie.

212
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,945
What, some stale milk
and an old piece of cheese?

213
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,982
- And it costs £1.8 million?
- Yes.

214
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,616
How much is that,
Jeremy, in rand?

215
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,953
Ten hundred and 30 million
and a million.

216
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,824
But for that it does
0-60 in 2.9 seconds?

217
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:55,963
So it's nearly as fast as an
Aventador or a Caterham R600,

218
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:57,497
or an Ariel Atom V8,

219
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,967
but much more expensive!

220
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:02,135
And not road legal.

221
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,837
Yes. Thank you very much
for relieving yourself
all over my enthusiasm.

222
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,273
You're welcome.

223
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,108
It is a brilliant,
brilliant car.

224
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,977
And only one question
now remains.

225
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:12,712
How fast will it go
round our track

226
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,614
in the hands of a man

227
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:19,052
who thinks that
everything British
is basically communist?

228
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,820
Here he is.

229
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,124
Looking a bit confused.

230
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:28,261
All right, folks, let's see
what this bag of bolts
will do.

231
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:33,133
And he's off,
and immediately on
to the Isn't Straight.

232
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,768
First corner coming up.

233
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,072
And he's flat through there.
That is ballsy.

234
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,708
Changing down, though,
for the second corner

235
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,110
on the Isn't Straight,

236
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,677
but now he can use
full power.

237
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,579
800 brake horsepower?

238
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,016
Are you kiddin' me?

239
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:53,586
Now, hard on the
brakes for Your Name Here.

240
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,888
He has got to be
impressed with this.

241
00:15:55,888 --> 00:16:01,194
For about $50,000, I could
get one of my old trucks
NASCAR style.

242
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,430
It's got
800 brake horsepower.

243
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,599
Go deer hunting,

244
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,801
you got room for
a couple deer in the back.

245
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,438
I don't think you can put
no deer in this thing.

246
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,106
Plenty of deer
to run over, though,

247
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,575
back on the Isn't Straight.

248
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:18,211
James Bond
drives one of these.

249
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:21,448
Shit. Vin Diesel
would whip his ass.

250
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:24,484
Yes, I'm sure he
would, but down into first.

251
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,654
I don't know
about this thing.

252
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,057
It's like a red-headed
stepchild I'm talkin'.

253
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,926
Be damn ugly.

254
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,963
Not sure
he's fully concentrating
past Old Lady's House.

255
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:40,267
But he is flat out
towards Substation.
It is bumpy here.

256
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:43,903
And there's new Tarmac
on the apex.
Will it kick the tail out?

257
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:46,273
Yes, it does indeed. He's OK.

258
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:48,475
Into Field of Sheep.
No sheep today.

259
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:49,976
And he's across the line.

260
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,182
Hell of a track, though.

261
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,550
- It is a hell of a track.
- Big car.

262
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,720
Anyway, we must now
bring up the lap board

263
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,691
and find out how fast
the American got round
in the Vulcan.

264
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,194
Let's have a look.
Ooh, it's quick.

265
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:09,996
Oh, hello. Hello.

266
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:18,438
There you go, see?
Old time rock'n'roll.

267
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:22,575
Old time rock'n'roll has
beaten rap and techno.

268
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,677
And R and B.

269
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,479
- And is now at the top.
- Very good.

270
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:29,116
Well done, and thank you.
Now we must move on.

271
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:34,321
It's time for us to take
a gentle stroll down
Conversation Street.

272
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,594
Right, sticking with
Aston Martin,

273
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:45,165
they've teamed up with Red
Bull Racing to create this.

274
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,934
It's called the 001.

275
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:53,140
It has a V12, no turbos,
none of that sort of
hybrid witchcraft.

276
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,176
Yet it produces
900 horsepower

277
00:17:56,176 --> 00:18:00,213
in a car that
only weighs 900 kilos.

278
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,815
Staggering.

279
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,984
Well, more than staggering,
that is a magic figure,

280
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:07,754
cos that means it has one
horsepower per kilogram.

281
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,956
And no other car
gets close to that.

282
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:13,893
Not remotely. The Vulcan's
barely half that.
It's staggering.

283
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:17,364
The only problem I have
with this... and you just
have to look at it.

284
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:19,666
Another angle we've got here.
Look at that.

285
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:23,069
You know that car is gonna be
all about aerodynamics

286
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,338
and particularly downforce.

287
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:26,639
And I hate downforce.

288
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,808
What do you mean,
you hate downforce?

289
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:33,180
Because they tell you you can
go round a 90-degree bend
at 100mph

290
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,782
because of the weight
of the air pressing down
on the body.

291
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,050
It's like having
an invisible elephant.

292
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,987
What if the elephant
falls off?

293
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,324
It's not a real elephant!
It can't fall off!

294
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,459
But how can you trust
something you don't see?

295
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,463
Wait. No, I'm with him
because what if you drove
through a sudden vacuum?

296
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,200
Well, that's not gonna happen
either, is it?

297
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,202
Hammond, listen.
There has to be a speed

298
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:57,003
in a car with active downforce,
like that one,

299
00:18:57,003 --> 00:19:00,573
where you go round a corner
too fast for the tyres,

300
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,242
too fast for the
mechanical grip,

301
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:05,345
but not fast enough for the
downforce to be working.

302
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:06,913
So you'd have to say
to the police,

303
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,982
"I crashed because
I wasn't going fast enough."

304
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,384
- It's true.
- Potentially.

305
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:12,952
There's another point,
actually,

306
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,787
the handling is gonna
depend on the weather.

307
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:17,690
If it's a really hot day,
the air will be thinner.

308
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,727
- No, thicker.
- No, it's thinner
on a hot day.

309
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,729
See, I'd be messed up already
cos I'd have the wrong...

310
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,564
That's the point.
You got a really hot day,

311
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,366
and you don't really
want to be driving a car

312
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:27,900
where whether or not
you get round a corner

313
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,002
depends on whether or not
the sun's out.

314
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,673
So you now want
weather forecasts to include
cornering speeds?

315
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,742
It's not just weather.
Altitude.

316
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:38,445
You could drive that car
round a corner at 100mph

317
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,480
in Holland, sea level,

318
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,282
but, what are we here,
6,000 feet up?

319
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:43,783
6,000 feet up here.

320
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,085
You'd barely be able
to get round at three mph.

321
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:48,588
You'd crash it into a tree,
or a visible elephant.

322
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:51,258
They are real.

323
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:54,126
Exactly. I just...
Honestly, downforce...

324
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,763
I don't like having to trust
something you can't see.

325
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:59,966
It's like North Korea.

326
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:02,935
Or the contraceptive pill.

327
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,173
That was an overshare.

328
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:10,743
There's actually another
hyper car I want to draw
your attention to.

329
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,179
- Replacement for the Veyron.
- Oooh!

330
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,014
That is the Bugatti Chiron.

331
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:18,885
It's got a quad turbo
8-litre W16 engine,

332
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:22,789
which every minute inhales
13,000 gallons of air.

333
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,057
- Just imagine.
- It's unbelievable.

334
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,993
1,500 horsepower.

335
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:31,431
And the top speed
is limited to 261 mph.

336
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:35,335
They say it would do 288
but that would be
irresponsible on the road.

337
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,307
It's got diamonds
in the speakers
for better sound quality.

338
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:42,342
Of course it has, yeah.

339
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:47,947
Oh, you'll like this. At top
speed, the force on each tyre
is 3,800G.

340
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,449
A man dies at 9G.

341
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,651
If you drive the Chiron
flat out

342
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:54,086
it'll drain its tank
in nine minutes.

343
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,724
Nine minutes?

344
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:00,192
Hang on a minute.
261mph at nine minutes.

345
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,596
That means you'd have to fill
up with fuel every 39 miles.

346
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:07,334
Well, less - you can't drive
until you run out, you'd have
to look for a petrol station.

347
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:10,136
Yes, James, it really isn't
a practical car, is it?

348
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,673
Gonna give you the most
amazing stat, though.

349
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:15,775
It's about the people
who are buying this car.

350
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,744
They've got 200 orders
so far.

351
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,912
And the average person
who's ordered one

352
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:26,686
already has 64 cars,
three helicopters,
three jets and one yacht.

353
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:28,187
Zuma.

354
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:37,029
I reckon he's got one
already.

355
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,499
Didn't say that.
He didn't say that.

356
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:42,134
Shall we move it on?

357
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:46,839
In South Africa, there are
35 carjackings every day.

358
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,908
- Every day?
- Every day.

359
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:51,811
I've got to say, well done,
that's an amazing figure.

360
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:55,382
I can't believe it. How have
you got time to come here?

361
00:21:55,382 --> 00:21:57,083
Cos you've got stuff to do.

362
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,519
They've all come here
in someone else's car.

363
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:01,388
So you've already done it?

364
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:04,391
But what they don't realise
is they're all walking home.

365
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,992
I've done a bit of research.

366
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:09,762
The most commonly jacked
cars, carjacked cars,

367
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:14,133
are the VW Polo, the Toyota
Hiace and the Toyota Hilux.

368
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,935
But they're the best-selling
cars in South Africa.

369
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:19,105
Exactly. The VW Polo
is the best-selling car
in South Africa.

370
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:20,707
So why would you buy a car

371
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:23,943
which increases your chance
of being shot in the head
and your car being stolen?

372
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:27,880
Why not buy a car that
nobody would want to steal?

373
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,419
No, cos if I lived here,
I'd get something like
a beige Volvo Estate.

374
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:35,154
That's just a car you want!

375
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:37,790
You're using it as an excuse
to get your dream car.

376
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:41,494
Look, Hammond, I've explained
it to you before.

377
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:44,831
Having a Volvo Estate
is a bit like needing to go
to the dentist.

378
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,734
It's gonna happen.
Get it over with. Just do it.

379
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,769
I don't want to
get it over with.

380
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:51,438
That's like going to the
dentist and saying,

381
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:53,740
"Take all my teeth out cos
they're gonna fall out."

382
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,476
"Just pull it all out,
it'll fall out anyway."

383
00:22:56,476 --> 00:23:01,180
"Stop me being
able to retain my urine.
It's gonna happen, too."

384
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,451
I'm gonna bury myself
and get it all over with
once and for all.

385
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:06,285
He has got a point,
seriously.

386
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:08,755
Let's enjoy it before
we have to have the Volvo.

387
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:12,725
But why do you all buy cars
that you're going to
get carjacked in?

388
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,861
Has anyone got
a Volkswagen Polo here?

389
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:18,798
You have? Did you buy
that for yourself?

390
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:20,867
- My dad bought it for me.
- Your dad bought it?

391
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:23,903
Wow! Oh, nice gift!

392
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,205
What sort of madness is this?

393
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:29,476
Has anyone got
a Toyota Hilux?

394
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,478
Yeah. This is insanity.

395
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:33,846
Is it yours?

396
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,549
What did you start out
with this morning?

397
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,184
It's unbelievable.

398
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:40,086
Anyway, listen,
we gotta move it on.

399
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,288
Because,
here in South Africa,

400
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:44,791
people have
an interesting approach
to preventing car theft.

401
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,759
Got a picture here
of one man's solution.

402
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,595
That's a python.

403
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,763
Now there's no question
it's gonna work.

404
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:54,000
I would not steal a car that
had that on the dashboard.

405
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,335
However, a python's
not like a burglar alarm.

406
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:58,304
You can't turn it off.

407
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:00,707
When you come back
to your car, how do you say
to the snake,

408
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:02,408
"It's my car,
don't strangle me."

409
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,043
You can't.

410
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,078
I'm pretty sure you can't
train a python, can you?

411
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:08,347
You can't. That's why you
never see sheep snakes

412
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:10,517
or guide snakes for the blind.

413
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:12,051
It'll never happen.

414
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:14,153
I have to say,

415
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:16,523
in England, we've got
an even more stupid solution.

416
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:19,291
This chap's come up with
an idea called "Bike Mine".

417
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,962
I've got a video of him here
explaining how it works.

418
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:26,633
It can be attached quickly
to protect almost any
personal possession

419
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,701
you store outside
or in a garage or shed.

420
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:32,371
Its robust steel construction
is covered in a rubber skin

421
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,240
to protect your property.

422
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,876
Bike Mine is safe
because the detonators
are self-contained...

423
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:39,712
as well as legal
to own and use.

424
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:42,882
Bike Mine is reliable
because there are
no batteries to run down

425
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:45,552
and only one moving part.

426
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:54,561
It's not gonna work.

427
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:56,328
What I can't understand is,

428
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,865
he said it can also protect
any other personal property
you may have.

429
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:01,033
What, like a Ming vase?

430
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:04,604
"Are you worried about your
child being kidnapped?

431
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:06,606
Simply hang this bomb
round their neck."

432
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:10,877
So, moving on,
to Jordan, weirdly,

433
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:13,780
where the government
has just built a mock town,

434
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,082
so that special forces
from all over the world

435
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:18,484
can turn up
and have a competition

436
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,653
to see which one is best.

437
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:22,955
Yes, and this year,
Mr Wilman,

438
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:26,225
who is the Fat Man
who controls our lives,

439
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,127
decided that us three
should go and take part.

440
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,129
Obviously there'd be
a lot of shooting,

441
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:32,064
running about
and doing somersaults.

442
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:34,133
None of which
we'd be any good at.

443
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:37,770
No, but, the SAS, the world's
first special forces unit,

444
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,139
was created to be fast,

445
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,041
to get into the battle quickly
and then get out again.

446
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:45,645
So there would also be
a lot of high-speed driving.

447
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:47,279
- Erm...
- Yes, I know.

448
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,682
That is a bit of a problem.
We'll gloss over that.

449
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:53,285
Anyway,
we were sent out there
and this is what happened.

450
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,638
This is it.

451
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:14,741
The special forces training
base deep inside Amman.

452
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:17,877
The city, obviously,
not... not...

453
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:22,114
Anyway, arriving now to
demonstrate what we'd have to
do later,

454
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:25,451
a squad of
special forces soldiers.

455
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:28,788
They exfoliated from a Black
Hawk helicopter on ropes

456
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:33,425
and then fought their way
through a terrorist-infested
building.

457
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:41,400
Their next task
was to steal a car,

458
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,271
which they used
to reach a hijacked airliner.

459
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:51,143
Here they stormed the cabin,
killed the bad guys...

460
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,347
and rescued a VIP.

461
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:02,154
There was then
a high-speed car chase
and a running gun battle,

462
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:04,323
as they escorted
the rescued hostage

463
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:06,859
to the safety
of a nearby embassy.

464
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,834
That was
quite impressive.

465
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,368
Well, it's not like
they were

466
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,837
- using real bullets.
- Yes, they were.

467
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:19,706
- They were not.
- They were!

468
00:27:19,706 --> 00:27:21,607
Are you saying
that on this,

469
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:24,476
let's be honest,
training ground,

470
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,814
people are allowed to run
around with real bullets
in these guns?

471
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:29,248
- Yes.
- Rubbish.

472
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:35,988
And there you are.
Real bullets.

473
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,090
And I managed
to shoot myself.

474
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,392
- Oh, yeah.
- How did you do that?

475
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:41,961
Well, because,
on an assault rifle,

476
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:43,930
the bullets
come out this side

477
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:47,066
and I'm a left-handed shot,
so they just go up my arm,
the casings.

478
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:49,235
You're gonna
be rubbish at this.

479
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:52,004
Well, I'm not going to be
able to use an assault rifle.

480
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,306
I'm not gonna be able
to storm that airliner.

481
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:56,943
I'm not gonna be able
to get out of the helicopter.

482
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:01,147
Fearing that things
may not go well,

483
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:03,515
we were told to go
and get ready.

484
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:07,119
And even that
was fraught with difficulty.

485
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:12,291
Why are you wearing white?

486
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,193
Snow camouflage.

487
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:17,764
It has never, ever
snowed in Jordan.

488
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:19,298
I didn't know
where Jordan was.

489
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:21,333
You're gonna be
quite visible.

490
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:24,570
At this point,
we received details

491
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,774
of our mission from
our boss, Mr Wilman.

492
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:30,309
"Each time one of you
is killed,

493
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,779
you all
have to begin again."

494
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:36,582
So it's like that
Tom Cruise movie.

495
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,017
What, Cocktail?

496
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:41,187
No, not Cocktail.
Or Rain Man.

497
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:43,389
This is gonna take forever.

498
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,801
Nevertheless, we were
soon in the helicopter

499
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:58,270
on our way
to the start of this
important rescue mission.

500
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:01,808
Let's just get this straight.

501
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:03,876
When we get over
the building,

502
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:05,812
we leap out of the door

503
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:08,014
and grab the rope
and slide down it?

504
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:10,716
Pretty much, yeah, that's it.
That's how it goes.

505
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:12,418
You could be leader.

506
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,721
Get out there, show us how
it's done, we will follow.

507
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:17,356
I don't want to.

508
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:20,192
I've never climbed a rope
or gone down one in my life.

509
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:21,828
Well, what a time.
Get on with it.

510
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:24,096
Why don't you go first?

511
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,865
I can't do that.
I'm scared of heights.

512
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:27,934
Lead by example.

513
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:31,037
- Be an inspiration
to your men.
- Yeah, exactly.

514
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:33,840
How high will it be?

515
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,742
- 30 feet?
- Yeah. You'll be fine.

516
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:39,745
What happens
if you fell 30 feet?

517
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:41,247
Would you be going home
with a head wand?

518
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:43,015
You'd be going home
in this helicopter

519
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:44,316
but not in that seat.

520
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:46,152
You'd be in a bucket
in the corner.

521
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:58,064
OK, here it comes.
Let's do this!

522
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,439
Whoa! Jesus Christ! Stop!

523
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,875
Oh, shit.

524
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:10,342
I'm very scared.

525
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:11,911
Mate, that's not
the attitude.

526
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,679
- Go on, then!
- Don't like it!

527
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,481
- Go down the rope!
- Don't want to do it.

528
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,383
- Loosen your hands a bit.
- I don't want to.

529
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:19,418
Do you want me to
tickle you on your belly?

530
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:21,353
- No.
- Well, go on, then!

531
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:29,095
- Hammond!
- Yeah?

532
00:30:29,095 --> 00:30:30,596
My trousers have fallen down.

533
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:36,035
Ladies and
gentlemen, Chuck Norris.

534
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:40,139
Oh, no, no.

535
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:43,442
Oh, yes. Have you ever

536
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:46,412
in your whole life
seen anything...

537
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:47,613
Aaagh!

538
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,988
I know I made that rope thing
look a bit difficult,

539
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:59,058
but actually it's
surprisingly easy.

540
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:01,393
So, why don't you go first?

541
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:04,163
- I've got a better idea.
- What?

542
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:06,198
Why don't we just land
the helicopter?

543
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:09,068
That is a good idea.
Helicopters can land.

544
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,118
Stop, stop, stop.
Hammond.

545
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:29,321
Right, listen,
you open the door,

546
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,723
and I'll throw
this stun grenade in.

547
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,959
Good idea. In three...

548
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,226
No, wait, wait!

549
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,028
I don't know how it works.

550
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:37,629
Oh, for God's sake.

551
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,302
Right. You ready, Hammond?

552
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:45,371
Go!

553
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,440
Come on!

554
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:53,712
I thought you said
it was a stun grenade?

555
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:56,348
I meant smoke.

556
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:58,050
I can't see a thing!

557
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,219
Literally nothing.

558
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:02,688
When the smoke
finally cleared,

559
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:04,190
we started our sweep.

560
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:07,693
Ssh. Quiet.

561
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:19,171
Dog. Dog.

562
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:23,009
No! It means door.
There's a door!

563
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:25,344
There's a door.

564
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,146
It's not a bloody football,
is it?

565
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:29,681
- Kick it.
- You put your foot flat.

566
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,019
That's how you do it.

567
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:36,022
- Nobody there.
- It's empty.

568
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:44,763
Nobody there.

569
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:47,599
Soon, though,
they were there.

570
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,111
We are trapped in this room.

571
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:01,413
Well, why don't we just
go out of the window?

572
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,182
We could go out
of the window.

573
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:05,651
Yeah, we could do that.
Cover us.

574
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:08,654
Yeah, I'll cover you.

575
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,557
As Jeremy
laid down covering fire...

576
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:15,127
...May and I climbed out
of the window.

577
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:17,663
But then,
there was a problem.

578
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,302
I'm stuck.

579
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:25,471
- Well, push!
- Ooh!

580
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:29,141
What?

581
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:31,410
The terrorists
are in the room.

582
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,079
How do you know?

583
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,813
They're doing things to me.

584
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,715
Ooh.

585
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:39,718
Oooh.

586
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,321
This is very uncomfortable.

587
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:44,090
It's probably cos
you're so tense.

588
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,891
Ohh. James!

589
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:47,793
- What?
- Kill me.

590
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:49,728
Shoot me.

591
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:50,896
Gladly.

592
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:52,531
Please hurry up.

593
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,566
- Fully automatic?
- Er...

594
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:56,102
Get on with it!

595
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:57,769
- Just give him the lot.
- In ten...

596
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,205
Not ten!

597
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:00,972
All right, in...

598
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:04,543
three, two, one.

599
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:08,414
How did you miss?

600
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:10,449
It's true what they say
about machine guns.

601
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,883
You can't hit a thing
with them.

602
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,120
- What?
- Just kill me.

603
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,122
We're trying!
It's not that easy.

604
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:17,723
Hang on. I'm out.

605
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:19,558
- Use the shovel.
Hit me with that.
- Right.

606
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,127
Do you want to say anything?

607
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:23,595
Yes. Final words. I hate you.

608
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:25,464
You know, I've dreamt
about exactly this.

609
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:27,133
- Hurry up!
- Incoming!

610
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,274
We are trapped in this room.

611
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:37,176
Why don't we go out
of the window?

612
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:39,578
Do you mind if
I go through the door?

613
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:43,849
This is better.

614
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:51,357
Heroically we fought
off all the attackers
outside the building.

615
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:57,229
But then we were
pinned down by a sniper.

616
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:03,702
- James. James.
- What?

617
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:05,904
Go down there
and steal that Renault.

618
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:07,773
Why?

619
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:10,075
Because this is a car show.
We need a motoring element.

620
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:12,811
- Good point.
- Go!

621
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:16,415
Can you think of anybody
on God's green Earth

622
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:19,918
less able to do this
kind of thing than him?

623
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,688
I mean, he can play
the harpsichord

624
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:25,257
but that's not a skill
we're gonna need today.

625
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:28,727
And he's been shot.

626
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,398
- James.
- What?

627
00:35:32,398 --> 00:35:35,201
- Go and steal
that Renault over there.
- Why?

628
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:37,836
Because this is a car show.
We need a motoring element.

629
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:40,306
Good point.

630
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:43,975
Can you think of anybody
on God's green Earth

631
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,612
who's less able to do this
sort of thing than him?

632
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:51,283
Can you think of anybody
on God's green Earth...

633
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:56,121
Can you think of anybody...

634
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:58,056
Can you think...

635
00:35:58,056 --> 00:35:59,791
James, you can't
just keep doing

636
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,927
the same thing
over and over again.

637
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:03,229
Nah, he'll miss eventually.

638
00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:06,298
Oh, God.

639
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:09,235
- Oh, for God's sake.
- There it is.

640
00:36:09,235 --> 00:36:12,838
Because Corporal Stubborn
wouldn't budge from
his tactic,

641
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,674
Richard and I decided
that on our next attempt

642
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,877
we'd go into battle
with some new equipment.

643
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:22,614
Go and steal that Renault.

644
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,837
Go and steal that Renault
over there.

645
00:36:58,484 --> 00:37:00,586
Ohhh!

646
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,592
James, go and steal
that Renault over there.

647
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:08,860
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

648
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,930
Well, there's a garage
over there. It'll have some
vehicles in it.

649
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,299
Oh, yeah.

650
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:18,304
Now we're in a car show.

651
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:22,674
Right, Jeremy,
you go sort that sniper,
we'll get these started.

652
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:24,343
Good plan.

653
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:27,413
Right, there's no keys.
I'll hotwire it.

654
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:29,881
Oh, there he is.

655
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:34,420
Say hello
to my little friend.

656
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:42,193
Yes! What a shot!

657
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,662
Ohhh!

658
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:45,230
I'll never be able
to do that again.

659
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,832
- Jeremy!
- What?

660
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:49,335
James has
electrocuted himself.

661
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:50,736
Oh, what a...

662
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:56,107
Say hello
to my little friend.

663
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,378
Right, there are no keys.
I'll hotwire it.

664
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:01,880
Have you not seen every
single movie ever made?

665
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:17,596
There's nowhere to put a gun.
That is a bad mark for Audi.

666
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:24,536
Sport, drive,
traction control off.

667
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:25,837
Here we go!

668
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,392
Unbelievable.

669
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:50,496
- Jeremy.
- What?

670
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:53,098
Why did your trousers
fall down?

671
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,767
Because there were so many
grenades attached to them.

672
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,669
And in the down-draught
of the helicopter...

673
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,906
I was very brave doing that.
I was.

674
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:03,775
- I'm sure I saw him crying.
- They were tears of bravery.

675
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:06,144
Oh, that well-known
expression. Tears of bravery.

676
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:09,014
Anyway, look, there's a bit
of a trend in South Africa

677
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:12,784
for making your own car,
making a car from scratch.

678
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,720
We've got an example here.

679
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,322
This man's built this one
based around the engine

680
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:19,324
and a few bits
from a BMW 318i.

681
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:22,060
And I've got to say,
I think that's pretty cool.

682
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,029
- It's brilliant.
- There are lots of these.

683
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:27,599
I prefer this one, also with
a BMW engine, a V8,

684
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,435
but the bodywork
is made of denim.

685
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:32,003
A man of exquisite taste.

686
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:34,940
I think the best of them all
is so good,

687
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,942
we've actually brought it
into the studio.

688
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:39,445
Look, it's down here.
Unbelievable, this.

689
00:39:39,445 --> 00:39:42,448
It's a replica
of a Mercedes C9.

690
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:45,350
Now that, Hammond,
was the car that won

691
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:48,454
the 24-hour Le Mans race
in 1989.

692
00:39:48,454 --> 00:39:51,490
And it's so amazing,
I've brought out the man
who built it.

693
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:54,626
Ladies and gentlemen,
give him a warm hand.
Johan Ackermann!

694
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,462
Thank you very much
for coming.

695
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,267
Can I just as--

696
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:03,769
Can I just ask, Johan,

697
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:06,872
how did you get
the styling to work?

698
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:09,708
Well, Jeremy, there was
no drawings on the internet,

699
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:12,277
so, erm... I got a book
on the dimensions,

700
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:15,681
but the closest I could get
was a 1:32-scale model.

701
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:18,049
Hang on, so
you measured your toy car,

702
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:21,620
multiplied it by 32
and built a full-sized one.

703
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,954
- Yep.
- That's how you did it?

704
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:25,691
- Is it road legal?
- Fully road legal.

705
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:27,726
- It's a real car,
not a model?
- Yeah.

706
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:29,795
How long did you spend
building this?

707
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:32,531
From start to roadworthy
was 16 months.

708
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,800
Right. Was there,
or is there,

709
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,602
a marriage
to have survived this?

710
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:39,571
Well, I hope so.

711
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:41,139
My wife is here,
so it must be a good sign.

712
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:44,209
Hello, patient lady.

713
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:46,545
Well, it's a remarkable
achievement, and well done.

714
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:48,079
Ladies and gentlemen,
Johan Ackermann.

715
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,582
That's brilliant.

716
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:52,551
Brilliant.

717
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,056
We're moving on
to a great idea

718
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:01,392
that Richard Hammond and I
have had all by our own.

719
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,629
- And it is brilliant.
- It is.

720
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:07,533
It's called, Making James May
Do Something He Doesn't
Want To Do.

721
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:10,602
And we kick off
with spinning.

722
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:12,704
It's a South African thing.
Fairly simple.

723
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,740
You get an elderly
rear-wheel-drive car,

724
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,743
take it to a car park where
you do doughnuts in it

725
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:19,911
to a backdrop
of strong rap music.

726
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:24,449
It's lively,
it's interesting,
and it's youthful.

727
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:26,552
It's everything he isn't.

728
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:46,838
Well, here we are, then,

729
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:49,474
at one of Jo'burg's top
spinning destinations,

730
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:52,711
the aptly-named
Wheelz 'n' Smoke Arena.

731
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:54,813
And the object
of the exercise,

732
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:56,347
as far as I can make out,

733
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,584
is to create smoke.

734
00:42:01,587 --> 00:42:03,288
And drive round
and round the arena

735
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:05,323
until the tyres go bang.

736
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,994
And then what's left
of the tyres

737
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:10,862
are put on a bonfire
over there,

738
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,431
to make sure there's
absolutely nothing left.

739
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:27,813
This is Stacy, and
she's only about 17, I think.

740
00:42:27,813 --> 00:42:30,115
And the word round here
and the noise in the crowd

741
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:32,117
says that Stacy is
actually very good at this.

742
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:35,621
But how the bloody hell would
I know? It's just a massive
cloud of smoke...

743
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,457
...with some headlights
occasionally appearing in it.

744
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,394
To help me get into
the spirit of things,

745
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:47,298
the organisers suggested I
should become more involved.

746
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:54,072
Aaaargh!

747
00:42:57,342 --> 00:43:00,511
Look at the rev case,
in the red constantly, mate.

748
00:43:03,148 --> 00:43:06,251
I don't like the smell of
tyre smoke in the evening.

749
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:09,888
Oi! Get back in!

750
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:13,825
Get back in the car,
you idiot!

751
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:16,995
Help!

752
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,672
Thank you.

753
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:40,085
- Has it broken?
- Yes.

754
00:43:40,085 --> 00:43:41,286
Finally.

755
00:43:58,704 --> 00:44:00,305
I got 20,000 miles

756
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:03,709
out of the last set of
rear tyres on my car.

757
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:34,205
Just go out there and do it.

758
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:36,141
Fancy trying to do that
in England.

759
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:38,276
Or anywhere.
Or Australia.

760
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:39,745
Anyway, mm-mm-mm.

761
00:44:39,745 --> 00:44:43,048
James May, was there any part
of that that you enjoyed?

762
00:44:43,048 --> 00:44:45,316
- Nope.
- Good.

763
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:48,419
But now it is time
for Celebrity Brain Crash.

764
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:57,996
Now after what happened
last week,

765
00:44:57,996 --> 00:45:00,365
our guest this week
declined our offer

766
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:03,068
to arrive at the studio
on a hovercraft,

767
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:04,870
saying she would prefer
to walk.

768
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,604
- It's understandable.
- Yes, it is.

769
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:08,306
I'm sure that despite this,

770
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:11,109
you will still give her
an enormous welcome.

771
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:14,279
Although she's now
a major Hollywood star,

772
00:45:14,279 --> 00:45:16,681
she was actually born
here in South Africa.

773
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:19,785
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome Charlize Theron!

774
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,991
We must ask her about
A Million Ways To Die
In The West.

775
00:45:25,991 --> 00:45:27,525
I love that film.

776
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:30,261
But what I really love
is the way she looks in it.

777
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:34,465
The hat and the floaty skirt.
She's on a bicycle as well.

778
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:40,405
- Oh, no.
- Oh, God.

779
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:44,442
- Oh, not...
- Ladies and gentlemen,

780
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:46,511
Charlize Theron has been
attacked by a lion.

781
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:49,314
- Oh, no.
- Literally nothing we can do.

782
00:45:51,016 --> 00:45:52,951
Does that mean
she's not coming on, then?

783
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:56,121
She's been eaten by a lion.

784
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:58,589
Well, look, are there any
other well-known

785
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,191
South Africans
in the audience?

786
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,160
It's not very likely, James.

787
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,995
There's only two globally
famous South Africans.

788
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:06,832
One's now in a lion
and the other's in prison.

789
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:10,568
Let's get back
to what we were doing.

790
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:13,905
Earlier on, we were at
a Jordanian special forces
training base

791
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:16,407
learning to be
super army soldiers.

792
00:46:16,407 --> 00:46:20,345
And we pick up the action
as we rush towards
the hijacked airliner

793
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:24,249
to rescue a VIP
and take them to safety.

794
00:46:35,861 --> 00:46:37,863
Let me talk you
through the plan.

795
00:46:37,863 --> 00:46:43,368
James and Richard
will use the catering lorry
as an assault vehicle.

796
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:45,937
And then,
after we've rescued the VIP,

797
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:49,975
we'll use the Audi
as a getaway car.

798
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:57,348
Now what we're doing here,
very cleverly,

799
00:46:57,348 --> 00:46:59,317
is we're going round
the back of the plane

800
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:02,153
because planes don't have
rear windows

801
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:05,523
or door mirrors, so they
won't see us sneaking up.

802
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:07,225
Stealthy, you see.

803
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:10,795
Hammond,
we're manoeuvring in.

804
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:13,031
- OK.
- Dab the brakes.

805
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,203
Right,
we are in position.

806
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:22,773
James is gonna lift me on
this platform to the door,

807
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:24,309
then we go in.

808
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:26,611
Right, are you ready?

809
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:28,479
I'm ready to lower the jacks.

810
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:29,981
Absolute stealth.

811
00:47:41,726 --> 00:47:43,594
I think the terrorists

812
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,663
are going to notice
this assault.

813
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:08,553
I think the terrorists are
going to notice this assault.

814
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:11,656
Which is why I shall now
cause a diversion.

815
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:17,295
I'm gonna make
a smoking doughnut
in front of the plane

816
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:19,530
to distract the terrorists.

817
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:24,769
Oh, no,
this is a disaster.

818
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:28,073
Even when you turn
the traction control off,

819
00:48:28,073 --> 00:48:29,640
it isn't fully off,

820
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,279
so you just get miles and
miles of dreary understeer.

821
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:36,481
Bad mark for Audi here.

822
00:48:40,285 --> 00:48:42,320
Come on!

823
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,855
The only good thing is the
terrorists will be looking

824
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,057
out of the cockpit windows

825
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:48,259
thinking, "Why is that Audi

826
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,996
understeering around
like that?"

827
00:48:50,996 --> 00:48:53,431
Right! Go low!

828
00:49:00,005 --> 00:49:01,439
Here I come!

829
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:05,076
Cry havoc and let slip
the dog of understeer!

830
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:23,294
Chaps, I have located the VIP

831
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,430
and it is the Queen
of England.

832
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,465
I don't like
the Royal Family.

833
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:31,036
James, now is not the time
for your republican views.

834
00:49:31,036 --> 00:49:34,272
Ma'am, we are an elite
fighting force.

835
00:49:34,272 --> 00:49:36,041
We have an Audi outside.
We will...

836
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:42,613
Why did you shoot Hammond?

837
00:49:42,613 --> 00:49:44,315
He was being annoying.

838
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,889
That's how you do it!

839
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:57,062
Ma'am, we are an elite
fighting force.

840
00:49:57,062 --> 00:49:59,164
We have an Audi outside.
We will...

841
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:07,138
- Did you shoot May?
- Well, he shot me!

842
00:50:11,142 --> 00:50:13,778
That's how you do it!

843
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:17,748
Somehow in our next attempt,
Hammond ended up on the wing.

844
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:25,190
Oh, I see. You wanna do this
the old-fashioned way.

845
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,458
OK, let's dance.

846
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:30,561
Aagh!

847
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:39,970
Ma'am, we are an elite
fighting force.

848
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:43,774
We have an Audi waiting
outside to get you to safety.

849
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:46,244
- And what do you do?
- I just said.

850
00:50:46,244 --> 00:50:48,679
We are an elite
fighting force.

851
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:51,216
We have an Audi waiting
outside to get you to safety.

852
00:50:51,216 --> 00:50:53,084
- You'll like it, it's German.
- Like you are.

853
00:50:53,084 --> 00:50:56,321
Thank you, James.
Are all the terrorists dead
back there?

854
00:50:56,321 --> 00:50:58,723
- Everybody's dead back there.
- Good man.

855
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:01,192
Your Majesty,
if you'd like to follow us.

856
00:51:09,134 --> 00:51:11,736
What was that?

857
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:14,139
He's just shot the Queen
in the back of the head.

858
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:16,674
Well, now what we gonna do?

859
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:20,278
Oh...

860
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:27,352
Go. I'll have that,
thank you very much.

861
00:51:28,886 --> 00:51:32,022
Having finally got
the Queen into the car,

862
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,659
we were now faced
with a perilous drive
to the embassy.

863
00:51:37,462 --> 00:51:41,232
However, this did at least
mean I could get back
to my day job.

864
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:46,704
I'll talk you through the car.
This is the S8 Plus.

865
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:51,942
Plus means it has
80 more horsepower
than the standard car.

866
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,913
That means 0-60
in 3.8 seconds,

867
00:51:55,913 --> 00:51:58,449
190.

868
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,618
How very interesting.

869
00:52:04,189 --> 00:52:07,892
The immense power
is harnessed not only
by all-wheel drive,

870
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:10,195
but also by ceramic brakes.

871
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:14,098
And an electronic
differential.

872
00:52:14,098 --> 00:52:17,802
There's a time
and a place for talking
about that stuff, mate!

873
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,770
Sitting behind
a six-foot-five-inch driver

874
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:22,273
means that rear leg room
is rather at a premium.

875
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:25,610
Having said that, however,
for a high-performance
saloon,

876
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,678
the ride quality
is really rather good.

877
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:30,080
Will you two stop
reviewing the car?

878
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,019
Do you have an opinion,
the Queen?

879
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:36,654
Not now!

880
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:42,293
Hold it steady,
I'm gonna shoot them.

881
00:52:45,463 --> 00:52:48,366
Shoot him in the face!

882
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:51,302
Have you come far?

883
00:52:56,441 --> 00:52:59,244
The Living Daylights.
Transporter 2 and 3.

884
00:52:59,244 --> 00:53:00,311
Taken. Ronin.

885
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:02,313
Why are you listing films?

886
00:53:02,313 --> 00:53:06,517
Because all those films
had a big Audi saloon
in them going quickly.

887
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:10,388
It is the car of choice
for the Hollywood hero.

888
00:53:11,556 --> 00:53:12,823
Shut up.

889
00:53:16,627 --> 00:53:19,129
What's the top speed
of that thing, James?

890
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,665
About 90 miles an hour.

891
00:53:20,665 --> 00:53:24,335
Well, here is a top tip
for Hollywood heroes.

892
00:53:25,603 --> 00:53:27,372
If you're being
chased by a car

893
00:53:27,372 --> 00:53:29,274
which is slower
than the car you're in,

894
00:53:29,274 --> 00:53:34,279
simply drive faster than it.

895
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:38,115
See, that's what Nick Cage
ought to have thought about,
really, in The Rock.

896
00:53:38,115 --> 00:53:41,619
And that man in Ronin, with
the S8 chasing the Citroen.

897
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:43,721
Stop talking about films!

898
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,723
There's a bogey
waxing our tail.

899
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,892
- Oh, God!
- Gonna shoot its petrol tank.

900
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:52,730
James, there's no point
shooting it. Petrol only
blows up in films.

901
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:03,941
Well, that's not strictly
accurate.

902
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:06,777
- Where the bloody hell is
the embassy?
- Go down here.

903
00:54:08,313 --> 00:54:10,315
- No, this is rubbish.
- There it is.

904
00:54:10,315 --> 00:54:11,949
There it is!

905
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:15,386
Right, you get the Queen
to safety. I'll cover you.

906
00:54:15,386 --> 00:54:17,822
- OK, I'm on it.
- Right, good. Go, go, go!

907
00:54:17,822 --> 00:54:19,089
Go, go, go!

908
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,391
Your Majesty.

909
00:54:20,391 --> 00:54:23,060
Really quickly, Your Majesty.

910
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:26,030
We can't see.

911
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:42,547
Come on, Jeremy, come on!

912
00:54:42,547 --> 00:54:44,982
I'm doing my best!

913
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:48,919
In the plums!

914
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:50,154
Oh, no!

915
00:54:50,154 --> 00:54:51,622
Just keep moving!

916
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:56,361
They've done it again!

917
00:54:56,361 --> 00:54:58,396
James, you're missing this!

918
00:54:58,396 --> 00:55:00,431
You cannot modernise
the royalty,

919
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:05,436
because royalty is,
at the very best,
a medieval concept.

920
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:08,673
Oh! Shooting!

921
00:55:08,673 --> 00:55:11,542
That's gonna sting!
He's still coming!

922
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:13,177
Keep going!

923
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:14,745
Mind the mines!

924
00:55:20,585 --> 00:55:22,186
He's still going!

925
00:55:44,609 --> 00:55:46,744
James, he's dead.

926
00:55:48,513 --> 00:55:52,249
No, wait a minute.
He's going again!
He's moving again!

927
00:55:52,249 --> 00:55:53,951
Jeremy, come on,
you can do it!

928
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:56,186
Come on, keep going!
Come on.

929
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,722
- This is it.
- Hammond...

930
00:55:57,722 --> 00:55:59,323
There's the finish line!

931
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:00,758
Am I going the right way?

932
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:04,462
More or less. Roll over it.
You can do it.

933
00:56:04,462 --> 00:56:07,164
Yes! We have done it.

934
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:13,571
Have you come far?

935
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:25,850
A fighting force. An
unbelievable fighting force.

936
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:29,787
We actually managed
to complete that course

937
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:32,256
in nine hours
and 48 minutes.

938
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:37,595
And that's only
nine-and-a-half hours slower
than the actual soldiers.

939
00:56:37,595 --> 00:56:39,664
Can I just ask, how many
times were you shot?

940
00:56:39,664 --> 00:56:41,866
- What, on the run in?
- On the way to the embassy.

941
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:46,136
Er... 17 to the torso,
two to the... plum set.

942
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:48,038
And you lived?

943
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:50,475
Well, obviously, James,
yes, look, I lived.

944
00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:54,679
He did. And on that
terrible disappointment,
it is time to end.

945
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:56,681
Yes, it is. Thank you
so much for watching.

946
00:56:56,681 --> 00:56:59,149
See you somewhere next week.
Goodbye!
