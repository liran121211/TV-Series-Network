Jacob Zuma is a bit of a
controversial figure here.

59
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:07,529
He recently installed a
swimming pool at his home.

60

And then, because he'd used
taxpayers' money to do that,

61
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,970
he said it was actually a water
storage facility in case of a fire.

62
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:18,873
So, in other words, if
he burst into flames,

63
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:21,008
he can jump into it and put himself out

had a meeting recently

to make a car that is
as good as a car can be.

101

They weren't talking
about making a racing car

102
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:49,931
because in racing there are rules

103
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,733
about how big the engine can be

104
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:53,334
and what sort of tyres you can use.

105
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:55,202
And they weren't talking
about making a road car,

106
00:05:55,203 --> 00:05:58,105

emissions regulations,

00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:31,979
not with the engine wound
down to 500 horsepower,

182
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,848
but with it turned up...

183
00:10:34,849 --> 00:10:36,551
...to the max.

184
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:50,999
Holy cow!
Ha-ha-ha!

185
00:10:55,203 --> 00:11:00,274
The engine is now producing 820 horsepower.

186
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:04,879
And the speed just beggars belief.

187
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,416
The bear is in attack mode.

188
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:16,423
The figures say it'll
do 0-60 in 2.9 seconds.

189
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:21,495
And has a top speed of 208
with that wing on the back.

190
00:11:21,496 --> 00:11:24,999
But it feels a hell of
a lot faster than that.

191
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,235
Oh, God!

192
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,211
The other thing you get for your money

193
00:11:37,212 --> 00:11:39,014
is a squadron of mechanics.

194
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:45,687
But sadly... not a handbrake.

195
00:11:47,455 --> 00:11:49,523
Right, what I've done now
is I've taken... yes...

196
00:11:49,524 --> 00:11:51,858
I've taken the steering wheel off,

197
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:54,997
so I can't put it in gear
to stop it rolling away.

198
00:11:55,998 --> 00:11:58,599
Oh, God.

199
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,734
Agh.

200
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:02,670
Argh, argh...

201
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:08,442
When I'd finally got it to stop,

202
00:12:08,443 --> 00:12:13,280
the jacks were deployed and
the mechanics set to work.

203
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:15,816
That's the thing about the Vulcan.

204
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:18,585
Wing angle, roll bar, suspension, brakes.

205
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:24,025
Everything can be adjusted
to suit your personal taste.

206
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:27,294
After ten minutes of pretending
I knew what they were doing,

207
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:29,564
I was back on the track.

208
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:38,173
And the car felt... just as
bonkers as it had done before.

209
00:12:39,907 --> 00:12:43,445
However, I've changed.

210
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:47,581
I've been driving this thing now,

211
00:12:47,582 --> 00:12:49,483
I don't know, three or four hours,

212
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:52,519
and I'm starting to... understand it.

213
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,322
I'm starting to get used to it.

214
00:12:55,823 --> 00:12:58,060
I'm starting to trust it.

215
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:02,263
Now I'm starting to understand...

216
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:04,131
why the Vulcan can go round

217
00:13:04,132 --> 00:13:07,468
the Nardo handling
circuit in southern Italy

218
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:13,074
nine seconds faster than the McLaren P1.

219
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:17,645
Nine seconds in car time, that's a year!

220
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:25,119
You get phenomenal mechanical grip

221
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,088
in the low-speed corners,

222
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:28,855
and then, on the Isn't Straight,

223
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:31,425
you've got a
ton-and-a-half of downforce,

224
00:13:31,426 --> 00:13:33,561
thanks to its aerodynamics.

225
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:41,302
Then you have the power from the engine,

226
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:45,106
which feels, well, old-fashioned.

227
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:46,640
Proper.

228
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:49,876
I'm surprised it doesn't have carburettors.

229
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:53,615
I love this thing very much.

230
00:13:58,153 --> 00:13:59,886
And what I love most of all

231
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:02,022
is that it's not a test bed.

232
00:14:02,023 --> 00:14:06,127
It's not an example of what
cars will be like in the future.

233
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:10,365
It's a celebration of what
they were like in the past.

234
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,135
What it is...

235
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:16,304
is old time rock'n'roll.

00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:23,444
- [CHEERING]
- Thank you, thank you.

237
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,647
Thank you very much.

238
00:14:28,783 --> 00:14:30,617
- So...
- What?

239
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:32,886
I get the impression
you quite liked the car.

240
00:14:32,887 --> 00:14:34,655
Oh, it's unbelievable.

241
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:36,723
What I loved most of all is
they've made it out of bits

242
00:14:36,724 --> 00:14:38,825
that they already had
lying around in the factory.

243
00:14:38,826 --> 00:14:40,327
It's like you going home

244
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:42,163
after your tripto South
Africa, opening the fridge,

245
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:43,497
and using what's there

246
00:14:43,498 --> 00:14:45,432
to make a delicious shepherd's pie.

247
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:48,169
What, some stale milk and
an old piece of cheese?

248

249
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:52,206
- And it costs £1.8 million?
- Yes.

250
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:53,840
How much is that, Jeremy, in rand?

251
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:56,177
Ten hundred and 30 million and a million.

00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:57,544
[LAUGHTER]

253
00:14:57,545 --> 00:15:02,048
But for that it does 0-60 in 2.9 seconds?

254
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:06,187
So it's nearly as fast as an
Aventador or a Caterham R600,

255
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:07,721
or an Ariel Atom V8,

256
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:10,191
but much more expensive!

257
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:12,359
And not road legal.

00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,061
Yes. Thank you very much for relieving
yourself all over my enthusiasm.

00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,201
And only one question now remains.

262
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:22,936
How fast will it go round our track

263
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:24,838
in the hands of a man

264
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,276
who thinks that everything
British is basically communist?

265
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:31,044
Here he is.

266
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:34,348
Looking a bit confused.

00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:38,485
All right, folks, let's see
what this bag of bolts will do.

268
00:15:38,486 --> 00:15:43,357
JEREMY: And he's off, and
immediately on to the Isn't Straight.

269
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:45,992
First corner coming up.

270
00:15:45,993 --> 00:15:49,296
And he's flat through
there. That is ballsy.

271
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:51,932
Changing down, though,
for the second corner

272
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:53,334
on the Isn't Straight,

273
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:54,901
but now he can use full power.

274
00:15:54,902 --> 00:15:56,803
800 brake horsepower?

275
00:15:56,804 --> 00:15:59,240
Are you kiddin' me?

00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:03,810
JEREMY: Now, hard on the
brakes for Your Name Here.

00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:06,112
He has got to be impressed with this.

278
00:16:06,113 --> 00:16:11,418
For about $50,000, I could get
one of my old trucks NASCAR style.

279
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:13,655
It's got 800 brake horsepower.

280

Go deer hunting,

281
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:19,025
you got room for a couple deer in the back.

282
00:16:19,026 --> 00:16:21,662
I don't think you can
put no deer in this thing.

00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:23,330
JEREMY: Plenty of deer to run over, though,

284
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,799
back on the Isn't Straight.

00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,435
James Bond drives one of these.

00:16:28,436 --> 00:16:31,672
Shit. Vin Diesel would whip his ass.

would, but down into first.

JEREMY: Not sure he's fully
concentrating past Old Lady's House.

292
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:50,491
But he is flat out towards
Substation. It is bumpy here.

00:16:50,492 --> 00:16:54,127
And there's new Tarmac on the
apex. Will it kick the tail out?

00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:56,497
Yes, it does indeed. He's OK.

295
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:58,699
Into Field of Sheep. No sheep today.

296
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,200

- Staggering.

319

Well, more than staggering,
that is a magic figure,

320
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:17,978
cos that means it has one
horsepower per kilogram.

00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:24,117
Not remotely. The Vulcan's

Because they tell you you can go
round a 90-degree bend at 100mph

in a car with active
downforce, like that one,

340
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:10,797
where you go round a corner
too fast for the tyres,

too fast for the mechanical grip,

351
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:34,788
That's the point. You got a really hot day,

352
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:36,590
and you don't really
want to be driving a car

353
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:38,124
where whether or not you get round a corner

354
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,226
depends on whether or not the sun's out.

355
00:19:40,227 --> 00:19:43,897
So you now want weather forecasts
to include cornering speeds?

356
00:19:43,898 --> 00:19:45,966
It's not just weather. Altitude.

357
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:48,669
You could drive that car
round a corner at 100mph

358
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,704
in Holland, sea level,

359
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:52,506
but, what are we here, 6,000 feet up?

360
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:54,007
6,000 feet up here.

361
00:19:54,008 --> 00:19:56,309
You'd barely be able to
get round at three mph.

362
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,812
You'd crash it into a
tree, or a visible elephant.

363
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:01,482
- [LAUGHTER]
- They are real.

364
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:04,350
Exactly. I just... Honestly, downforce...

365
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:06,987
I don't like having to trust
something you can't see.

366
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:10,190
- It's like North Korea.
- [LAUGHTER]

367
00:20:10,191 --> 00:20:13,160
- Or the contraceptive pill.
- [LAUGHTER]

368
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:17,397
- That was an overshare.
- [LAUGHTER]

369
00:20:17,398 --> 00:20:20,967
There's actually another hyper car
I want to draw your attention to.

370
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:23,403
- Replacement for the Veyron.
- AUDIENCE: Oooh!

371
00:20:23,404 --> 00:20:25,238
That is the Bugatti Chiron.

372
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:29,109
It's got a quad turbo 8-litre W16 engine,

373
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,013
which every minute inhales
13,000 gallons of air.

374
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:35,281
- Just imagine.
- It's unbelievable.

375
00:20:35,282 --> 00:20:37,217
1,500 horsepower.

376
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:41,655
And the top speed is limited to 261 mph.

377
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:45,559
They say it would do 288 but that
would be irresponsible on the road.

378
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,494
[LAUGHTER]

379
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:50,531
It's got diamonds in the
speakers for better sound quality.

380
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:52,566
Of course it has, yeah.

381
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:58,171
Oh, you'll like this. At top speed,
the force on each tyre is 3,800G.

382
00:20:58,172 --> 00:20:59,673
A man dies at 9G.

383
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:01,875
If you drive the Chiron flat out

384
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:04,310
it'll drain its tank in nine minutes.

385
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:05,846
[AUDIENCE EXCLAIMS]

386
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,948
- Nine minutes?
- [LAUGHTER]

387
00:21:07,949 --> 00:21:10,416
Hang on a minute. 261mph at nine minutes.

388
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:13,820
That means you'd have to fill
up with fuel every 39 miles.

389
00:21:13,821 --> 00:21:17,558
Well, less... you can't drive until you run
out, you'd have to look for a petrol station.

390
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:20,360
Yes, James, it really isn't
a practical car, is it?

391
00:21:20,361 --> 00:21:21,662
[LAUGHTER]

392
00:21:21,663 --> 00:21:23,897
Gonna give you the most
amazing stat, though.

393
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:25,999
It's about the people
who are buying this car.

394
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,968
They've got 200 orders so far.

395
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:30,136
And the average person who's ordered one

396
00:21:30,137 --> 00:21:36,910
already has 64 cars, three
helicopters, three jets and one yacht.

397
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:38,411
Zuma.

398
00:21:38,412 --> 00:21:40,214
[LAUGHTER]

399
00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:47,253
I reckon he's got one already.

400
00:21:47,254 --> 00:21:49,723
Didn't say that. He didn't say that.

401
00:21:49,724 --> 00:21:52,358
Shall we move it on?

402
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:57,063
In South Africa, there are
35 carjackings every day.

403
00:21:57,064 --> 00:21:59,132
- Every day?
- Every day.

404
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:02,035
I've got to say, well done,
that's an amazing figure.

405
00:22:02,036 --> 00:22:05,606
I can't believe it. How have
you got time to come here?

406
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:07,307
Cos you've got stuff to do.

407
00:22:07,308 --> 00:22:09,743
They've all come here
in someone else's car.

408
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:11,612
- [LAUGHTER]
- So you've already done it?

409
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:14,615
But what they don't realise
is they're all walking home.

410
00:22:14,616 --> 00:22:16,216
I've done a bit of research.

411
00:22:16,217 --> 00:22:19,986
The most commonly jacked
cars, carjacked cars,

412
00:22:19,987 --> 00:22:24,357
are the VW Polo, the Toyota
Hiace and the Toyota Hilux.

413
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:26,159
But they're the best-selling
cars in South Africa.

414
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,329
Exactly. The VW Polo is the
best-selling car in South Africa.

415
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,931
So why would you buy a car

416
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:34,167
which increases your chance of being shot
in the head and your car being stolen?

417
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:38,104
Why not buy a car that
nobody would want to steal?

418
00:22:38,105 --> 00:22:42,643
No, cos if I lived here, I'd get
something like a beige Volvo Estate.

419
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:45,378
- That's just a car you want!
- [LAUGHTER]

420
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:48,014
You're using it as an
excuse to get your dream car.

421
00:22:48,015 --> 00:22:49,449
[LAUGHTER]

422
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,718
Look, Hammond, I've
explained it to you before.

423
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:55,055
Having a Volvo Estate is a bit
like needing to go to the dentist.

424
00:22:55,056 --> 00:22:57,958
It's gonna happen. Get
it over with. Just do it.

425
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,993
I don't want to get it over with.

426
00:22:59,994 --> 00:23:01,662
That's like going to
the dentist and saying,

427
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:03,964
"Take all my teeth out cos
they're gonna fall out."

428
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,700
At the barber's: "Just pull it
all out, it'll fall out anyway."

429
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:11,404
The doctor: "Stop me being able to
retain my urine. It's gonna happen, too."

430
00:23:11,405 --> 00:23:14,675
I'm gonna bury myself and get it
all over with once and for all.

431
00:23:14,676 --> 00:23:16,509
He has got a point, seriously.

432
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,979
Let's enjoy it before we
have to have the Volvo.

433
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,949
But why do you all buy cars that
you're going to get carjacked in?

434
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,085
Has anyone got a Volkswagen Polo here?

435
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:29,022
You have? Did you buy that for yourself?

436
00:23:29,023 --> 00:23:31,091
- My dad bought it for me.
- Your dad bought it?

437
00:23:31,092 --> 00:23:34,127
- [LAUGHTER]
- Wow! Oh, nice gift!

438
00:23:34,128 --> 00:23:36,429
What sort of madness is this?

439
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,700
Has anyone got a Toyota Hilux?

440
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:41,702
Yeah. This is insanity.

441
00:23:41,703 --> 00:23:44,070
- Is it yours?
- [LAUGHTER]

442
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:46,773
What did you start out with this morning?

443
00:23:46,774 --> 00:23:48,408
- [LAUGHTER]
- It's unbelievable.

444
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:50,310
Anyway, listen, we gotta move it on.

445
00:23:50,311 --> 00:23:52,512
Because, here in South Africa,

446
00:23:52,513 --> 00:23:55,015
people have an interesting
approach to preventing car theft.

447
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,983
Got a picture here of one man's solution.

448
00:23:56,984 --> 00:23:58,819
RICHARD: That's a python.

449
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,987
Now there's no question it's gonna work.

450
00:24:00,988 --> 00:24:04,224
I would not steal a car that
had that on the dashboard.

451
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:06,559
However, a python's not
like a burglar alarm.

452
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,528
You can't turn it off.

453
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:10,931
When you come back to your car,
how do you say to the snake,

454
00:24:10,932 --> 00:24:12,632
"It's my car, don't strangle me."

455
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:14,267
- [LAUGHTER]
- You can't.

456
00:24:14,268 --> 00:24:16,302
I'm pretty sure you can't
train a python, can you?

457
00:24:16,303 --> 00:24:18,571
You can't. That's why
you never see sheep snakes

458
00:24:18,572 --> 00:24:20,741
or guide snakes for the blind.

459
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:22,275
- [LAUGHTER]
- It'll never happen.

460
00:24:22,276 --> 00:24:24,377
I have to say,

461
00:24:24,378 --> 00:24:26,747
in England, we've got an
even more stupid solution.

462
00:24:26,748 --> 00:24:29,515
This chap's come up with
an idea called "Bike Mine".

463
00:24:29,516 --> 00:24:33,186
I've got a video of him
here explaining how it works.

464
00:24:33,187 --> 00:24:36,857
It can be attached quickly to
protect almost any personal possession

465
00:24:36,858 --> 00:24:38,925
you store outside or in a garage or shed.

466
00:24:38,926 --> 00:24:42,595
Its robust steel construction
is covered in a rubber skin

467
00:24:42,596 --> 00:24:44,464
to protect your property.

468
00:24:44,465 --> 00:24:47,100
Bike Mine is safe because the
detonators are self-contained...

469
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:49,936
as well as legal to own and use.

470
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:53,106
Bike Mine is reliable because
there are no batteries to run down

471
00:24:53,107 --> 00:24:55,776
and only one moving part.

472
00:24:55,777 --> 00:24:57,912

473
00:25:01,783 --> 00:25:04,785

00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:06,552
What I can't understand is,

475
00:25:06,553 --> 00:25:09,089
he said it can also protect any
other personal property you may have.

476
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,257
- What, like a Ming vase?

480
00:25:18,332 --> 00:25:21,101
So, moving on, to Jordan, weirdly,

481
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:24,004
where the government has
just built a mock town,

482
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:26,306
so that special forces
from all over the world

483
00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:28,708
can turn up and have a competition

484
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:30,877
to see which one is best.

485
00:25:30,878 --> 00:25:33,179
Yes, and this year, Mr Wilman,

486
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,449
who is the Fat Man who controls our lives,

487
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,351
decided that us three
should go and take part.

488
00:25:38,352 --> 00:25:40,353
Obviously there'd be a lot of shooting,

489
00:25:40,354 --> 00:25:42,288
running about and doing somersaults.

490
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:44,357
None of which we'd be any good at.

491
00:25:44,358 --> 00:25:47,994
No, but, the SAS, the world's
first special forces unit,

492
00:25:47,995 --> 00:25:50,363
was created to be fast,

493
00:25:50,364 --> 00:25:52,265
to get into the battle
quickly and then get out again.

494
00:25:52,266 --> 00:25:55,869
So there would also be a
lot of high-speed driving.

495
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,503
- Erm...
- Yes, I know.

496
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,906
That is a bit of a problem.
We'll gloss over that.

497
00:25:59,907 --> 00:26:03,510
Anyway, we were sent out there
and this is what happened.

base deep inside Amman.

Anyway, arriving now to demonstrate
what we'd have to do later,

502
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:35,675
a squad of special forces soldiers.

503
00:26:35,676 --> 00:26:39,012
They exfoliated from a Black
Hawk helicopter on ropes

504
00:26:39,013 --> 00:26:43,649
and then fought their way through
a terrorist-infested building.

506
00:26:49,223 --> 00:26:51,624
Their next task was to steal a car,

which they used to reach
a hijacked airliner.

and rescued a VIP.

511
00:27:08,075 --> 00:27:12,378
There was then a high-speed car
chase and a running gun battle,

00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:14,547
as they escorted the rescued hostage

513
