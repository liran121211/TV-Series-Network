00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,424
Hello and welcome to
a Grand Tour special,

2
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:26,427
which begins with this:
the Volkswagen Beetle.

3
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,462
It's a car we hate very much

4
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,999
because it appeals only
to Nazis and hippies,

5
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:35,069
and we are neither
of those things.

6
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:37,538
However,
if you remove the bodywork

7
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:40,007
and replace it with something
a bit more fun -

8
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:41,275
something like this--

9
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:43,377
you end up with
a beach buggy,

10
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,346
and that's brilliant.

11
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,415
We love beach buggies.

12
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,850
However, Mr. Wilman disagrees.

13
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:52,120
He says that
if they'd been any good,

14
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:53,554
they would have caught on,

15
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:56,023
and he points out
that they didn't.

16
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,827
So he hatched a plan.
And it's this:

17
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,397
he said all three of us
must buy a Volkswagen Beetle,

18
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:05,633
turn it into a beach buggy,

19
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:06,867
and then report with it

20
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:11,172
to a wild, rugged
and extremely remote place--

21
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:14,675
here on the coast of Namibia.

24
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,168
This is what I've built.

25
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,971
It's as close
as you can possibly get

26
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:47,175
to the original
1964 beach buggy

27
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,809
built by Bruce Meyers.

28
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:55,549
Underneath,
it is a 1950s Beetle--

29
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,451
Beetle floorpan,
Beetle suspension,

30
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,253
Beetle engine,
Beetle gearbox.

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,621
It's got Beetle lights on it.

32
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:02,290
I've even got
a Beetle speedometer

33
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,192
and Beetle hubcaps.

34
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,195
It's brilliant!

35
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:14,535
This is a beach buggy
very like the one
that Steve McQueen drove

36
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,337
in the original
Thomas Crown Affair.

James May has built
what a beach buggy was,

43
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:37,891
what I've built is what
a beach buggy can be...

00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,431
...if you have
a bit of imagination

45
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,234

It's amazing, isn't it?
I mean, more seals.

What David Attenborough
never told us about those

53
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,996
is how bad they smell.

JEREMY: Sadly, before
our nature documentary
could go any further,

55

Richard Hammond
emerged from the mist.

00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:26,907
Ooh, hello.
That's not a beach buggy.

57
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:29,943
- Is it?
- Well, I wouldn't
call that...

- Ah-ha!
- Oh, geez.

What are you wearing?

- These trousers,

65
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,458
did they say in the shop,

66
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:46,093
"I'm afraid
they are yellow, sir"?

67
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,495
When you left,
they went, "Yes!

68
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,197
20 years we've had
those on the hanger!"

69
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:51,565
- (THEY LAUGH)
- Shut up.

70
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,066
And then we must
move over to this.

71
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,902
- Yeah.
- We were told

72
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,904
to build beach buggies.

73
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,572
- Yes.
- Beach buggies.

74
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,441
JAMES: It's not a beach buggy.
JEREMY: It isn't.

75
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:01,842
RICHARD: It is a beach buggy.

76
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,611
It isn't a beach buggy.
It's got a roof!

77
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,346
There's no Beetle
in here at all.

78
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:07,515
Yes, there is.
Beetle engine in there.

79
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,551
OK, this space-frame chassis...

80
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:12,185
- Yeah.
- Is it from a Beetle?

81
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,323
- No.
- These enormous
suspension components

82
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,224
that don't even fit
under the bodywork.

83
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:20,761
- You've got two lots
of suspension at the back.
- Twin shocks.

84
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:24,965
- Twin shocks?
- I like an off-road
sort of vibe.

85
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:27,200
To get here,
we had to drive on a beach.

86
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:28,802
-Yeah.
-Ours have made it.

87
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,104
I didn't need two lots
of rear suspension on mine.

88
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,373
Neither did I.

89
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,207
Look, we were told
to come to Africa.

to Santa Monica Beach,

93
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:44,051
That's the most metal flake
I've ever seen.

94
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,353
Any beach in the world.

95
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:47,020
Um...

96
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,690
- Hang on, what's that?
- That's the engine.

97
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:52,225
- What engine is it?
- V8!

98
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,961
I've put a V8
in a beach buggy!

99
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,262
Well, no, you haven't.

100
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:57,230
You've parked your
beach buggy quite close.

101
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:58,566
It's not in it!

102
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,933
- It isn't in it.
- (RICHARD LAUGHS) No.

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,068
You've reversed into a V8,

104
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,436
but not quite hard enough.

105
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,004
It's only gone in
a third of the way.

106
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,773
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is

107
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,808
to fit a V8 to a beach buggy?

108
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,377
- Well, it doesn't fit!
- It's obviously impossible.

109
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:10,978
Exactly, it's impossible.

110
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,580
This is no ordinary V8.

111
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,014
It started out in life

112
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,149
as a 3.5 litre V8
from a Range Rover,

113
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:21,288
but I've modified it,
so it produces
180 horsepower.

114
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:23,256
Can I just say,
you were doubting

115
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:25,092
the credibility of mine
as a beach buggy.

116
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,494
Yeah.

117
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,228
The defining characteristic
of a beach buggy

118
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,831
is an air-cooled,
flat-four Beetle engine.

(CLEARS THROAT)

120
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,401
No, that's not
an engine, James.

121
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:34,602
That's just a fan.

122
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,103
How many horsepower
does yours have?

123
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,405
94!

124
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:39,306
So I have twice
as many horsepower.

125
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:41,542
- Shall I tell you something?
- They're not in the car,
though.

126
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:43,411
- They are, they're near it.
- Yes.

127
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:45,746
It's interesting, isn't it?
I mean, that is an entire--

128

Nothing about that
is interesting.

00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,416
This is a blank canvas

130
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,483
onto which you could
paint your personality.

131
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,118
- Yes.
- Yours has got

00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,886
a prolapsed V8 hanging
out of its backside

133

...all your personality,
and it's standard.

It's not...
What do you mean, standard?

at this point was a map,

so we decided
to head north up the coast

JAMES: Freezing cold,
sandpapered on the face...

347
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:18,278
- You've got a coat on.
- It's thin. Have you felt it?

348
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,180
I haven't even got
a thin coat.

349
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:21,581
I've only got
a T-shirt. Anyway,

350
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,150
I'm not going to be
competitive with you

351
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,551
about who's the coldest.

352
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,453
- I'm the coldest!
- We're all the lostest.

353
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,821
Never mind. Look,
let's not get bogged down

354
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,223
with whose fault it was.

355
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,159
There's no being bogged
down with it, is there?

356
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,127
It was yours.

357
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,962
We can either go
back into the desert

358
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:37,564
to look for a road,

359
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,966
or we can just do what
we were doing yesterday,

360
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,534
and stay on the beach.

361
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,970
At least we know, if we
keep the sea on our left,

362
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:45,238
we're going north.

363
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,673
- Yes.
- That's a fair point.

364
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,242
- Let's navigate by the sea.
- JEREMY: Yes.

365
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:53,113
JEREMY: With our new--
well, newish--

366
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,314
plan in place,

367
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,183
we set off once more.

368
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:01,754
So here we are. These are our
wheel marks from yesterday.

369
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:06,393
24 hours of cold, misery...

370
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,428
to achieve exactly nothing.

371
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:11,131
I mean,
it is exactly nothing.

372
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:14,501
But, apart from that
and the weather...

373
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:19,406
and Jeremy Clarkson,
it's all going really well.

374
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,274
JEREMY:
As we continued north,

375
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,776
the misery of
the previous day was banished

376
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:27,580
by the sheer bigness
of our surroundings.

377
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,583
Oh, this is
an astonishing place.

378
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:37,457
I've got a dune the size
of Mount Everest to my right,

379
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:40,727
the Atlantic Ocean
to my left...

380
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:41,861
(LAUGHS)

381
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,697
This is absolutely epic.

382
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,142
This is proper
beach buggy driving.

383
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,611
Sun's out, sea's there
with the surf.

384
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,580
It's like being
in the Beach Boys.

385
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,352
(LAUGHS)

386
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,554
JEREMY: Amidst all
this loveliness, though,

387
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,825
there was one small elephant
edging its way into the room.

388
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,727
Chaps, I don't want to
have to say this,

389
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:18,231
but is the tide coming in
or going out?

390
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,702
RICHARD:
Uh...I'm guessing in.

391
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:27,307
There's no way
up the sides of that.

392
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:32,011
And if the tide comes in
that far, which it does,

393
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,181
we've had it.

394
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,815
Got to keep moving here.

395
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,517
We cannot afford
to get stuck.

396
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:44,191
JEREMY: With some generous
use of the throttle,

397
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,625
we managed to get clear

398
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:48,595
of the sea-and-sand-dune
pincer movement.

399
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:51,631
But then we had
another problem.

400
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,703
I'd say that was the end
of the beach.

401
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:59,772
RICHARD: How does that
just end like that?

402
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,708
JEREMY: It does just end.
JAMES: That is the end.

403
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,043
JEREMY: And the Namibian
government doesn't allow us

404
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,679
to drive on the salt pans,
and that's what that is.

405
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,315
This meant,
according to James,

406
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:11,684
we had only one option.

407
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,553
We've got to go back
the way we came.

408
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,987
But if the tide's coming in,

409
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:18,325
that narrow bit
will have become impassable.

410
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:22,028
That's why I think
if we see a good opportunity
to turn left,

411
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,364
like we did last night,
we do it.

412
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:26,399
Are you honestly suggesting
we go back in the...

413
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,235
Well, where else can we go?

414
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:30,337
We'll either drown
or starve otherwise.

415
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:37,677
Right, we've just
got to find a bit

416
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:41,748
where we can get inland
before the tide comes in.

417
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,822
That is getting closer
to that,

418
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,624
and when that happens,
we've had it.

419
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:57,964
RICHARD:
But as we thundered along,

420
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,468
the dunes refused
to open up and let us in.

421
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,504
That's the sea!

422
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,274
It's the sea, there!

423
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,510
Oh, it's coming at me!

424
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,582
JEREMY: I still say
we can't get out here, look.

425
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,550
No left turn at the moment.

426
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,723
This is where you need a V8!

427
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,991
(ENGINE REVS)

428
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:28,395
Oh, shit.

429
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,332
Oh, Jeremy's in trouble!

430
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,100
That is not looking good!

431

00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,707
Oh, no.

00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,645
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Not a good place.

- Oh, God.

438
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,816
Uh...I'm in the sea.

439
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,453
Because it was
a bit of an emergency,

440
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,255
my colleagues
decided to help for once.

441
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:59,058
- Go.

442
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,192
JAMES: No.

443
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,894
Is that just spinning?

444
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,530
It's beached under there.

445
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,498
I don't see why
I can't push him with that.

446
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,800
-All right, then. Try.
-All right.

447
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,569
James, count us in.

448
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:12,038
Three, two, one, away!

449
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:20,347
JEREMY: Yes!
RICHARD: Right, let's go!

450
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:27,086
Me getting beached cost us
time we never had
in the first place,

451
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:29,422
and we were still trapped.

452
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:34,060
Jesus Christ.

453
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,830
Ah, it's coming in.

454
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,670
Come on, come on, come on.

455
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,506
Come on.

456
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,075
Whoa!

457
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:55,615
Oh!

458
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,518
Oh, that's bad.

459
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:03,222
Shit.

460
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,724
(ENGINE REVS)

461
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:06,993
Whoa!

462
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:11,097
Come on, baby, come on.

463
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,504
RICHARD:
Mercifully, the dunes finally
started to fall away

464
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,572
and we were saved.

465
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:25,512
-And we're through!
-We are, we are.

466
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:26,879
That's a relief.

467
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,083
So nearly got stuck then.

468
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,657
RICHARD: We'd now been
on the go for 36 hours,

469
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:42,662
and we were
pretty much back where
we started from... again.

470
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:45,665
We were also soaked,
frozen, worn out,

471
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,667
and because
we had no food with us,

472
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,802
we were also hungry.

473
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,706
But then Bear Clarkson
came to the rescue.

474
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:57,243
Cold you go and get
some driftwood for a fire?

475
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:01,180
And could you fashion
a rudimentary barbecue
grill of some sort?

476
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,716
OK. Where did you get
the fishing rod from?

477
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,885
It's my whip aerial.
It's a beach buggy.

478
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:08,154
- I thought of that.
- They're fishing rods.

479
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:18,598
This is going to make
a perfect little
fish grill thing, look.

480
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:25,137
Have you got a fire lit yet?

481
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:26,473
I thought you were fishing.

482
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:28,741
I am fishing.
My car's fishing.

483
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:30,843
- Look.
- Well, is it?

484
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,079
- Yeah, look,
I've got the rods attached.
- It's parked.

485
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,014
JEREMY: What's that?
JAMES: That's the grill.

486
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,650
So we hold that
with the pliers
from my multi-tool,

487
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,652
cut the fish up, fillet it...

488
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:43,556
Can you do that?
There's no point asking him.
He can open a tin...

489
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,024
Can you fillet a fish?

490
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,159
- What, is it only fish?
- Well, it's the sea!

491
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,829
What did you think I was
going to catch, a chicken?

492
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:51,063
Oh, my God!

493
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,506
RICHARD: Oh, my God!
JAMES: No, wait. Yes!

494
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:01,708
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

495
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,043
While Hammond went off
to get more driftwood,

496
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,614
James and I set about
gutting the catch.

497
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,283
JEREMY: Use his car
as the table. There we go.

498
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,420
- That's his gut.
Look. You've got it.
- Yeah, right.

499
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:16,022
Oh, God. Shit. Look,

500
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,857
it's all gone literally
onto his exhaust.

501
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:20,359
Oh, no. Never mind.
Look, I need your help.

502
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:21,794
Right, saw its head off.

503
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,866
- Ah, there we go.
- Excellent.

504
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:29,135
- I think, but I'm not sure--
- It's gone under his seat.

505
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,436
Oh, no. Has it?

506
00:24:30,537 --> 00:24:32,071
It's all right,
I'll get it out later.

507
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:38,177
JAMES:
Oh, it's done a treat, this.

508
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:39,879
Look at this, Hammond.

509
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:44,450
Mm.

510
00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:45,885
Oh, that's all right,
isn't it?

511
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,155
Ooh.

512
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,563
It tastes like fish,
doesn't it?

513
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,832
OK, does anybody want a beer?

514
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:02,401
- JAMES: Have you got some?
- No.

515
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:04,971
- Oh, you...
- (JEREMY LAUGHS)

516
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:07,640

It's the Namib Desert.

00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:51,550
RICHARD: Many miles ahead,

694
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:54,653
we'd pulled over for a break
from the endless bumps,

695
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,689
and James was being
very interesting!

696
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:04,062
The good thing about this hat
is you can angle it,
like a heliostat,

697
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:05,431
to where
the sun's coming from.

698
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,032
Yes, that's true.

699
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,735
But you still look a tit.

700
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:12,904
Luckily for Hammond, who
could do with the company,

701
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:15,641
I was back on the move.

702
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:19,978
Right, a new style of driving
is now required.

703
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:24,082
This arm for steering,
this arm for changing gear,

704
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:29,020
and then another arm
for deaccelerating, like so.

705
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,022
Yes!

706
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:32,724
Accelerate.

707
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,626
(ENGINE REVS)

708
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,528
Deaccelerate.

709
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,997
Sometimes, if you
listen very carefully,

710
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:40,832
you can hear my genius.

711
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,070
JEREMY: Back as a threesome,
we continued

712
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:49,541
with our seemingly
endless journey to the east.

713
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:52,744
Just need to find a road now.
This is not funny any more.

714
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:55,347
Enough desert.

715
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:57,449
I don't want another night
in the desert.

716
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:01,620
I smell pretty bad.

717
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:03,389
And I suspect that
if we manage

718
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:06,325
to find somewhere tonight
near civilisation,

719
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:08,294
we should probably
have a ceremonial

720
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,196
bonfire of the underpants.

721
00:37:11,297 --> 00:37:12,664
JAMES: In truth, though,

722
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,767
I thought we'd be
in the desert forever.

723
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:19,971
But then,
late in the afternoon...

724
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:25,577
I'm looking ahead,
and I'm not seeing
an endless sea of sand.

725
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:28,414
I'm seeing green.

726
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:32,718
Trees!
Those are trees and shrubs!

727
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:38,690
Pylons!

728
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:41,327
Pylons!
That means electricity.

729
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:46,798
Oh, yes!

730
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,501
Civilisation!

731
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:54,005
JAMES:
And then, best of all...

732
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:56,942
Oh, my God.

733
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,919
I honestly thought we had
another night of sleeping...

734
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,555
- (JAMES SIGHS)
- ...in the sand.

735
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,957
But, no! Look at it!

736
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:15,761
Nicest thing I've ever seen.

737
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:21,800
JEREMY: I could go east,
I could go west...

738
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:24,202
Whichever way you go, it goes
somewhere. That's the point.

739
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,037
It's a road,
it goes somewhere.

740
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:29,240
You know what we've
just done, don't you?

741
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:32,744
We've just crossed
the Namib Desert
in three beach buggies.

742
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,145
- We have.
- We did.

743
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:36,014
We did.

744
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:38,950
There is literally nothing
can stop us now.

745
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,756
JEREMY: Admittedly,

746
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:48,059
our crossing had not exactly
been as the crow flies,

747
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:49,828
but we had found our road,

748
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:52,063
and that's all that mattered.

749
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,533
Oh, yes!

750
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,668
That's the best thing
I've ever seen!

751
00:38:56,735 --> 00:39:00,406
Yes,
it is the road to freedom!

752
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:02,841
- (HISSING)
- What the hell was that?

753
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:09,314
Something has just exploded
at the back of my car.

754
00:39:09,415 --> 00:39:11,617
Oh, dear.

755
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,052
By the time my colleagues
had got back to me,

756
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,922
I'd worked out
what the problem was.

757
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,157
It's really
straightforward, OK?

758
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:22,661
- The top bolt has come
out of the shock absorber.
- Right.

759
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:26,264
It shot up, boinged
into the coolant pipe,

760
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:29,668
and three gallons of water
have simply burst out,

761
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:32,471
going everywhere
except into the engine.

762
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:36,274
- Right.
- So all I've got to do
is reattach the top bolt...

763
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:40,846
mend the pipe and find
three gallons of water...

764
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:45,250
which I shall get
from a passing motorist,
and I'll be on my way.

765
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,351
Right.

766
00:39:46,452 --> 00:39:47,586
All I could do
with a hand with

767
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:49,154
is just lifting the car up

768
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,289
so I can reattach the, um...

769
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:53,224
Yeah. Well,
is there anybody here?

770
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,894
- There's...
- I suppose a motorist
will pass eventually.

771
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:58,630
The one that gives you water
will also lift it up for you.

772
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:00,466
You could just
lift it up a little bit.

773
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:02,400
Or we could go
and have a beer.

774
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:02,468
Or we could go
and have a beer.
- I hear traffic.
- Yes.
- We'd better not be here.

775
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:04,335
- I hear traffic.
- Yes.
- We'd better not be here.

776
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,438
We don't want to interfere
when you're trying to talk

777
00:40:06,505 --> 00:40:08,006
'cause we might put them off.

778

(ENGINES REV)

779
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:14,613
Right.

780
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:29,795
Somewhere along here
there will be a place,

781
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,964
and that place
will have a bar in it

782
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,566
that will contain beer.

783
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:40,506
Do you have any water?

784
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:41,940
- Huh?
- Water.

785
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:44,242
Because the radiator
has blown,

786
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,911
so I need just three gallons.

787
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:49,214
Look, you've got some water
there. Just a bucket.

788
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:55,621
It's an actual water lorry...

789
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:58,490
leaking water,
and he won't give me any.

790
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,230
Eventually,
I flagged down a local

791
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,533
who had water to spare.

792
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:09,568
Thank you.

793
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:12,003
And then I got on
with the repairs.

794
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:16,642
That is one reassembled
shock absorber.

795
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,143
That's reattached,

796
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,879
so that's the cooling system
back in one piece.

a small hole in the front

00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,814
you do a mile, it overheats.
