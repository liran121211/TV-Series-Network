1
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:21,555
Since you're
in beach buggies,

2
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,391
you will now drive
to the beach

3
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,093
at the northernmost point

4
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,161
of Namibia,
where it meets Angola.

5
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:30,264
It's 1,000 miles away.

6
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:32,100
RICHARD: We have
got to find this road.

7
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:35,636
This is not gonna be
too clever in the dark.

8
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:39,540
Listen. I shall find
the Southern Cross.

9
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:42,110
RICHARD:
Oh, this is a bad idea!

10
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:43,677
We are now trusting
our lives

11
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:46,147
to an orangutang who
thinks he's Patrick Moore.

12
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:49,950
JAMES:
24 hours of cold, misery,

13
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:52,120
to achieve exactly nothing.

14
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,655
I mean,
it is exactly nothing.

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,825
RICHARD: Oh, it's coming in!

16
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,161
(JEREMY YELLS)

17
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:02,630
This is the best desert
I've ever been to.

18
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,565
Holy shit!

19
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:06,800
RICHARD: Oh!

20
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,836
(YELLS)

21
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:13,141
JEREMY: What it actually
is is a big, orange
killing engine.

22
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:15,042
- Jesus!
- (LAUGHS)

23
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:17,478
RICHARD:
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God!

24
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,681
Please make it! Please!

25
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:28,289
Just need to find a road now.
This is not funny any more.

26
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:30,191
I don't want another night
in the desert.

27
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,460
Oh, my God.

28
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,528
I could go east,
I could go west.

29
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,730
RICHARD: Whichever way
you go, it goes somewhere.

30
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:40,401
Yes! It is the road
to freedom.

31
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:41,269
(THUD)

32
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:42,870
What the hell was that?

33
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,811
What I'm driving here,
or attempting to drive,
is Apollo 13.

34
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:01,889
JEREMY: It was morning
by the time I nursed
my wounded car into Windhoek,

35
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,092
and my well-rested colleagues
were full of admiration

36
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:07,328
for how I'd pulled off
such a feat.

37
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,731
-Is that the first thing
you thought of?
- What?

38
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,201
Tear a hole in it.
What's that gonna do?

39
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:16,737
I needed to get to the bleed
valve on the radiator,
which is there.

40
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:19,773
- Is it?
- And, to make life
doubly difficult...

41
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,277
...I trod on my spectacles.

42
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:24,678
(RICHARD LAUGHS)

43
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,647
That is tragic,
trying to fix it with one lens.

44
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:30,684
I was trying to fix it.
And the only eye
I can close is this eye.

45
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,321
-You can't close
your left eye?
-I can't close my left eye.

46
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:37,391
Why didn't you put them on
upside down? You'd have
the lens over the other eye.

47
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,495
That is logic there.

48
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,631
- Oh, yeah.
- (LAUGHS)

49
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:46,400
- Come on, let's go.
We've got a lot to do.
- JEREMY: No!

50
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,602
The one thing we have
established now is that,

51
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,371
with the exception
of Windhoek,

52
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:55,243
which is the capital,
Namibia is a tough
and arduous place.

53
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:56,977
- Yeah.
- Have you bought maps?

54
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,747
- No.
- Have you got tenting
equipment of any sort?

55
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:03,284
Have you got somewhere
to sleep other than
the desert floor? No.

56
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:06,354
So why don't we, today,
get prepared

57
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,723
for the next leg of the -
big leg of the journey?

58
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,426
- That is a good idea.
We'll do that.
- That's not a bad idea.

59
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:15,863
We'll grant ourselves
a day of... shopping. Mm.

60
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:19,700
First of all,
would you permit me
to chisel some of the cheddar

61
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:22,135
that has grown
in my underpants away?

62
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,604
Well, not here.

63
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,608
JEREMY: Having de-cheesed
my body parts,

64
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:31,512
we headed out to get
the necessary supplies.

65
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,981
RICHARD:
The thing is, if we go mesh,

66
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,817
it'll keep the sun off
but it won't keep
the light out.

67
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,287
That will wake us up early.
That's 1.5 kilograms. But--

68
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:43,524
Hammond, the first thing
you need to know before we
start shopping in here

69
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:46,026
is James and I are in charge.

70
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,028
- RICHARD: Well...
- JAMES: Sorry, he's right.

71
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,163
No, you're not.
You don't know anything
about camping.

72
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:52,300
- JAMES, JEREMY: Exactly.
- How does that make you
in charge?

73
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,368
Because we know
it's all terrible.

74
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:58,005
If we leave it to you,
we'll all end up sleeping
in small green triangles.

75
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,441
The camping you know about
is in the Lake District,

76
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:03,210
where you deliberately
make yourself miserable.

77
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:04,312
I'm sorry, he's right.

78
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:07,381
It is possible, I think,

79
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,650
with a bit of ingenuity
and money,

80
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,452
to make tenting bearable.

81
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,689
JEREMY: Richard Baden-Hammond
disagreed,

82
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,492
so we went our separate ways.

83
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,394
Correct, incorrect.

84
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,029
- Exactly.
- Do you agree?

85
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,797
- But I'd go even
more correct.
- Oh, yes!

86
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:27,801
Perfect. Roll it out
on the desert floor...

87
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:30,338
...you're home.

88
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,440
Oh, James! Le Creuset!

89
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:35,843
See, Hammond would hate this,
because this weighs
more than a tent.

90
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,045
- Which it does, actually.
- A lot more.

91
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,449
- And it weighs more
because it is a quality item.
- Exactly.

92
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,784
Pocket trowel.

93
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:44,885
Pocket soap.

94
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,355
Here we go.

95
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:50,424
- Pasta spoon.
- Yeah, good idea.

96
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,461
I find that bottle opener
a bit... lightweight.

97
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:55,363
Yeah, more expensive
is what we're looking for.

98
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,197
You see, look at this, James.

99
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,833
This is the sort of thing
Hammond would think
is a chair.

100
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,072
Ooh! That's all you need.
That's your whole... stove.

101
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,640
That's it.

102
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:08,909
- Is it gas? It is, isn't it?
- I presume so.

103
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:12,546
For two, you could get
a small chicken in there,
or... a pheasant.

104
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,548
We're getting there now.

105
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,552
So that folds down to that.

106
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:23,791
Yeah.

107
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,829
JEREMY: The next morning,
we headed out once more,

108
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:31,599
with the camping gear
James and I had bought

109
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,066
bringing up the rear.

110
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,440
And besides stocking up
with essentials,

111
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:45,813
Hammond and I had used
our day off in Windhoek
to modify our cars.

112
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,417
To solve
my overheating problems,
I've fitted a ram-air scoop,

113
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,221
which shovels refreshing,
cooling air into the radiator
as I go along.

114
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:58,459
And, as you may have noticed,
I've fitted a spoiler.

115
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,732
My only complaint, really,
about my beach buggy

116
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,968
was its lack of performance
in third and fourth gears.

117
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,538
Couldn't up power
from the engine and I don't
want to stress it,

118
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,440
so I could lighten it.

119
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,943
I've stripped away
the superstructure here
and the passenger seat,

120
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,911
anything spare.

121
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:23,751
That means this car
is 30-40 kilos lighter
than it was before.

122
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:28,188
Jeremy, why has your car
sprouted a green moustache?

123
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:31,959
JEREMY: Well, it's a spoiler
for added downforce
at the front end,

124
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,628
which you need
in a rear-engine vehicle.

125
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:37,831
This thing will be unbelievable
through the corners now,

126
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,066
it really will.

127
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,167
Like a 911.

128
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:42,836
And I tell you what,

129
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,838
even with your new
lightweight buggy,

130
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,542
you're no match for what
I've got here this morning.

131
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,344
Yeah, I'm sorry, mate.
This is quicker.

132
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,814
- It is not.
- It is.

133
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:57,084
Right, Richard Hammond,
I challenge you to a race.

134
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,753
OK, you're on. Idiot.

135
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,756
JEREMY: We shall find a race
track and we shall do racing.

136
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:05,225
Well, you carry on.
I'm not doing any racing.

137
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,495
That's utterly pointless.

138
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,098
JEREMY:
On the outskirts of the city,

139
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,300
we found a rather
excellent circuit

140
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,603
where we could do timed laps,

141
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:19,006
and James could try out
his new vacuum cleaner.

00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:21,509
JAMES: Oh, yes.

144
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:25,746
- Are you ready?
- No.

145
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,649
- Why not?
- Temperatures and pressures.

146
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,918
This is a racing machine.
Look at it.

147
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,554
It's a plastic beach buggy
parked near a V8.

148
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,523
- With aero.
- Really?

- In...

Yeah,
I'm gonna do it in gear.

153

- Give it a shot.
- I'm gonna try that.

154

- In--
- No! Throttle's jammed.

- Jammed.
- In--

No! You can keep saying "in"

00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:28,876
Any car which can wheelie
off the line...

171
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,579
is going to be able to beat
yours, and would have done.

172
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:32,980
So... Sorry.

173
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,748
You're saying
because your car started,

174
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,684
well, 50 yards away
over there,

175
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,719
wheelied, was uncontrollable,
slammed back down

176
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:40,954
and broke itself,
it's the best on the track?

177
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,389
JEREMY: Yes.

178
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,258
Well, much learned.
Really useful.
Glad we did it.

179
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:52,399
RICHARD: With Jeremy's
endlessly troublesome car
fixed again,

180
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,069
we scooped up James' Dyson
and continued northwards

181
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:59,640
towards the finish line
at the border with Angola.

182
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,847
The going was smooth and easy
and eerily quiet,

183
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:09,249
which begged a question.

184
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:14,321
Now, apparently, Namibia
is the most dangerous place
in the world to drive.

185
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,890
There are more accidents
per head then anywhere else,

186
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:19,727
and car accidents are
the first

187
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:23,130
and most common cause
of death in young adults.

188
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,499
How? How can that be so?

189
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:28,936
I mean... the place is empty.

190
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,779
In Britain,
there are 250-260 people
for every square kilometre.

191
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:41,114
Here... it's two.

192
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,051
Two!

193
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:47,320
This makes the Australian
outback look like Monaco.

194
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,857
Monkey! Monkey!

195
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:53,060
Huge anus! Did you see
that thing's anus?

196
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,497
JAMES:
I, however, was not thinking

197
00:09:57,564 --> 00:10:00,834
about population statistics
or monkeys' bottoms.

198
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,737
I was just happy
to be on a smooth surface

199
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:07,040
in a car that wasn't filled
with dust.

200
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,642
I shall relax...

201
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,979
...with the lovely view.

202
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:16,616
Sadly, though,
a few miles later...

Ow! Ow! Agh!

209
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,230
James May?

210
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,900
Yes, I can hear you,
but it's very uncomfortable

211
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,102
and my car has...
has cut out.

212
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,143
JAMES: Ow!

213
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,212
JEREMY:
Mercifully for James,

214
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,214
we eventually arrived
at a game reserve,

215
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,050
which we decided
would be an ideal place

216
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:53,053
to set up camp
for the night.

217
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,322

00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,527
That's what we need.

JEREMY: As Hammond
built his canvas hovel...

221
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:10,771
...James and I were looking
forward to a more civilised
evening

222
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,139
in the tents we'd bought,

223
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,007
and which had been erected

224
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,844
by the butler
we'd also bought.

225
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,747
JAMES:
Thank you, Giovanni.

226
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,751
Tuck your shirt in, man!
It's not a bloody caravan site.

227
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:26,219
Erm...
I'm just thinking, dinner.

228
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,221
Mm. Do you mind
if I get changed?

229
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,991
- No, exactly.
I'm gonna have a shower.
- Mm.

230
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,794
- Or I may have
a bath, actually.
- Why not?

231
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,163
Giovanni,
could you run the baths?

232
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,775
JEREMY: Apparently,
this place has got oysters.

233
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:50,510
- Really? Here?
- Yeah. I know,
it's extraordinary.

234
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:51,945
Who knew?

235
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,881
Are you coming
for some dinner?

236
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,316
RICHARD: What do you mean,
"Coming for dinner"?
I'm cooking here.

237
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,785
There's a restaurant
just down there.

238
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,252
- A restaurant?
- Yeah, just down there.

239
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,221
I don't want to go.

240
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,990
I'm cooking this.
I'm doing it properly, camping.

241
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,691
- Well, come and--
- I'll join you after dinner.

242
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,126
JEREMY: Whatever.

243
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,560
JAMES: He's such a peasant,
isn't he?

244
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,029
JEREMY:
It's just unbelievable.

00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:10,530
(METALLIC CLANGING)

246
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:11,932
JEREMY: That evening
in the restaurant,

247
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,967
Hammond never did join us.

248
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:17,370
But James and I were not
short of company.

249
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:21,141
Oh, look, there's rhinos!
There's actual rhinos!

250
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,676
And they've been dehorned.

251
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:24,812
They've had to take
its horn out

252
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,047
to stop poachers shooting it.

253
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,950
But you know what
the poachers are doing?

254
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:31,551
They shoot the dehorned ones,

255
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,855
because if they track for
a couple of days, a rhino,

256
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,656
and then it's got no horn,
they shoot it,

257
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:40,193
and then they'll never
track it again,
so it saves time.

258
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,930
Do you know how much you get
for a rhino horn now?

259
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,598
- On the... On the market?
- Yeah, in Vietnam.

260
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:46,834
I'm guessing it's a lot.

261
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,636
$320,000.

262
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,339
- So that's more expensive
than gold.
- Good God.

263
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:56,109
Even the nub that's left
that he's got is still worth,

264
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,710
I don't know,
thousands of dollars.

265
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,913
I was gonna say, no matter
how carefully you dehorn it,

266
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,016
there's still horn
going down into its nose.

267
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:07,254
- JEREMY: That's such
a tragedy, that, you know.
- JAMES: Yeah.

268
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,489
I want to do something
about this while we're here.

269
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,424
I'm sure we could come up
with something.

270
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,427
I'm sure we could.

272
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:28,708
RICHARD:
The next morning, I woke
to find I'd been recruited

273
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:33,446
into the Clarkson and May
Rhino Protection Squad.

274
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,715
They were even convinced
that our beach buggies

275
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:40,587
would be ideal
for tracking the poachers.

276
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,756
I can't deny,
they do have a point
about the whole rhino thing.

277
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:45,358
It is ridiculous.

278
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:48,761
Two rhinos killed every day
in Africa by poachers,

279
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:53,566
and then sold to a market
that believes it's a cure
for cancer,

280

281
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,472
But are we necessarily
the right men

282
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:02,609
to tackle it head-on
in the field?

283
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,279
Ow! (YELLS)

284
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,216
Wouldn't we be better just
popping a £1 coin in a jar

285
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:13,486
and letting somebody who
knows what they're doing
solve it?

286
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,288
Well, I've got
a tranquilizer gun

287
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,925
from the place where
we were last night, but...

288
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,128
...I can't see anyone
to shoot.

289
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:28,635
JEREMY: Figuring
that the poachers probably
didn't use the main road,

290
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,838
we went off
to look in the bush.

291
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:33,606

What about over there?

292
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,410

No poachers.

294
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,583
It may be some poacher.

JEREMY:
What's stupid?

299
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,729
RICHARD: How would you
recognise a poacher
when you saw one?

300
00:14:56,796 --> 00:15:00,167
- And when you find one,
what are you gonna do?
- Shoot him.

301
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,969
All we're doing
on our journey

302
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,737
is driving
three beach buggies
to the Angolan border.

303
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:06,773
- Yeah.
- Which doesn't further
the cause of humanity.

- JAMES: Exactly.
- RICHARD: And this does,
does it?

00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:12,745
We've got a day, Hammond.
Give us 24 hours.

306
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:16,516
24 hours. Then, I promise,
we'll get back on the road.

307
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,690
JEREMY: Once our sceptical
colleague had agreed,

308
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,725
I decided to change tack,

309
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:29,196
abandon the cars
and search from the air,

310
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,699
using some beach-front
parasailing equipment.

311
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,336
- Jeremy?
- Yes?

00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:39,272
If we don't make it,
please know that I hate you.

313
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:42,642
There's not a breath of wind,
so don't be stupid.

314
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:45,612
Oh, my parachute's been...

That's not worked at all.

318
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,926
JEREMY: OK. Right,
I'm not gonna do that.

319
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:03,396
Clearly, my solution
was too dangerous for us,

320
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,099
so we sent Giovanni up
instead.

did he?

JEREMY: Giovanni failed
to spot any poachers,

327
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:25,252
so we told him
to stop messing about

328
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,920
and get back to camp
to pour some drinks,

329
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:31,091
whilst we had a rethink.

330
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:33,960
Everything we've tried
has gone wrong.

331
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:36,563
So let's accept it now
and move on.

332
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,964
We can go.

333
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:39,366
No.

00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:43,536
I think the poachers
only go out at night.

00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,072
Oh, for God's sake.

336
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,739
We'll let the sun set,

337
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,608

is the poacher-to-lion ratio?

to find?

is look for rhino tracks,

will be following.

is a rain shower

to leave you behind.
- You wouldn't wake up.

No, obviously, you didn't
want to leave me behind,

395
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,079
so you did the logical thing,

396
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,648
which is suspend me from

and made from
40-year-old components,

424

the answer
was depressingly predictable.

The alternator, as you can
see, has come off its hinge.

426

The bolt's supposed to go in
there and it's just come off.

And the bolt, well,
that's somewhere back there,

of keeping his car

And that's why ,
the following morning,

482

I came up with
a radical plan.

Don't drive on the road,
drive near it.

only half a kilometre,

by comparison.

foolish, cos we could just
end up as skeletons.

it's agony in mine.

it's more comfortable for us.

we can blame him.

you're happy with this.

508
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:43,736
How bad must it have been
for him if this is better?

509
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,043
Oh, God al-bloody-mighty!
What an idiot that man is!

510
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,445
Yeah,
this is a lot less bumpy.

511
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:54,747
Oh, Christ!

512
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:58,517
Jesus!

513
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:00,052
Is this better? Really?

514
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,357
Stop moaning!

515
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:08,695
(GRUNTS)

516
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:13,465
JEREMY: Hammond, my entire
throttle assembly has
disintegrated.

517
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:16,168
RICHARD: I can't see why.
I'm sure this is all
helping it.

518
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,104
JEREMY: Perfectly
all right on the road.

519
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,706
Yeah, I don't know why
more people

520
00:27:19,706 --> 00:27:22,709
don't drive their cars
on the road.

521
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:25,211
Stop blaming your failures
on the scenery.

522
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,715
Every bone in his crotch...

523
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:30,416
that's what I'm gonna break.

524
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,919
Every single one of them.

525
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,421
And then,
if it were at all possible,

526
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,990
May Tours got even worse.

527
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:43,029
Oh! Oh, God! The dust! Agh!

528
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:47,900
What is this Star Trek
special effect we've
arrived in?

529
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:51,237
Oh, my God!

530
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,009
I am swimming through dust.
I'm actually swimming in it.

531
00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:01,513
Oh, dear, oh, dear!

532
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,817
JAMES: We had driven into
something called fesh fesh,

533
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:07,754
a sand as fine
as talcum powder.

534
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:09,756
Oh, shite!

535
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:13,292
And this had made Ali G
even more cross.

536
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,895
(REVVING)

537
00:28:15,962 --> 00:28:18,765
I can't see a bloody thing
now. I've got to...

538
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:21,801
I can't even find James May
to kill him.

539
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:26,305
(GROANS)

540
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:30,142
JEREMY:
OK, the engine's boiling
and I'm stuck.

541
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,411
All my electrics
have gone haywire

542
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,981
My... It's still trying
to turn the motor over.
The battery's dead.

543
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,783
Are you stuck, James?

544
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:38,985
Er... (COUGHING FIT)

545
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:42,588
(COUGHING)
I think I'm stuck.

546
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,690
Well done, James.

547
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:46,492
Improved our lot no end.

548
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,294
So the situation is...

549
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,930
Hammond has broken his car,
you're stuck,

550
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:53,065
and mine's overheated.

551
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:56,969
Are we going to say, James,
that your idea was stupid?

552
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,471
It was stupid.

553
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:06,078
JEREMY:
With even Sergeant Stubborn
admitting defeat,

554
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:08,414
it was time
to throw in the towel.

555
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,518
So we got ourselves sorted
out, got a wash in the river

556
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,388
and headed back to the road.

557
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:19,291
There you go.
Freshly ironed linen shirt

558
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:23,830
with epaulettes
that matches my beach buggy.

559
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,297
Ironed by Giovanni.

560
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,002
Despite everything,

561
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:33,639
our beach buggies
had covered 750 miles

562
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,842
of our 1,000-mile journey,

563
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:38,510
and we were now well
into the tribal regions

564
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,112
of northern Namibia...

565
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:44,350
...which is
picture-book Africa.

566
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:49,856
Well, this is all a bit
too beautiful for words
along here.

567
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:51,891
Look at this.

568
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,993
Tribal Namibia, I like it.

569
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:04,336
Where we are now,
it's genuinely...

570
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:08,374
Well, what would you say,
"unspoiled"? Yeah.

571
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,709
People do live the lives

572
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:13,145
they've led here
for thousands of years.

573
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:17,016
Oh, no!

574
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:20,853
Oh, no! I'm dying!

575
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,589
Annoyingly,
the James May excursion

576
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,325
had caused more damage
than I'd realised.

577
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:29,929
Oh, now this is stuck on.

578
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:31,663
Oh, bugger.

579
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,800
Then, instead of the
breakdown-recovery service,

580
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:37,403
some topless ladies
arrived...

581
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,238
(SHRIEKING AND SINGING)

582
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:40,772
RICHARD: Hello.

583
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,710
...which made knowing where
to look a bit difficult.

584
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:45,945
Oh!

585
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:52,018
Erm... Concentrate
on the job, Richard.

586
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,455
This is unusual.

587
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,524
I mean, normally
the AA would have done.

588
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,526
(SINGING CONTINUES)

589
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:01,627
Thank you!

590
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:04,396
Very good.

591
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:07,266
- (SINGING CONTINUES)
- Oh, there's more.

592
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,211
JEREMY:
I, too, was nursing wounds
as a result of May Tours.

593
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:20,846
I do seem to have lost...

594
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:22,481
(ENGINE CHUGS)

595
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,150
...one of my cylinders
somehow.

596
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,952
I'm driving a V7.

597
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:31,723
Basically, this is now
Spitty Spitty Bang Bang.

598
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,826
So, at the lunch stop,
Richard and I decided

599
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:36,963
to get our revenge
on Mr May.

600
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:48,607
Clarkson!

601
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:49,976
What?

602
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:51,643
You've put... Where's...

603
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:54,146
That is disturbing.

604
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:55,982
What's annoying is,
what have you done

605
00:31:55,982 --> 00:31:58,150
with my original
vintage VW gear knob?

606
00:31:58,217 --> 00:32:00,352
Ah, well, no,
good news on that.

607
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,554
Giovanni has posted
your original gear lever

608
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,023
back to your address
in London.

609
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,691
- Has he?
- RICHARD: Special delivery.

610
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,995
What is the matter with you?
That's really offensive.

611
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:11,497
Well, I think that's
a bit sexist.

612
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:14,366
No, it's not.
Why would I want to drive
with a rubber penis?

613
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,502
I don't know.
I think you're weird.

614
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:17,669
(LAUGHTER)

615
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:26,612
RICHARD: With our break over,
we got back on the road.

616
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:30,082
For our American viewers,
James May is driving
a dick-shift.

617
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,387
And it wasn't
just James's knob

618
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,323
that was keeping us amused.

619
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,591
There was something else
we'd learned over lunch

620
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,760
that was even funnier.

621
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:45,264
James May's fuel tank has
a hole in it, or it's split.

622
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:48,034
He's driving a bomb.

623
00:32:50,236 --> 00:32:51,937
It's a tense moment, this.

624
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:54,806
It's like the end of a
football match when it's 1-1.

625
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:56,942
You're driving along,
you know he's gonna blow up,

626
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:59,378
you just don't know when.

627
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:01,347
RICHARD: It's not gonna
read well in the papers.

628
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:05,284
"James May died
in an exploding beach buggy,
holding a rubber penis."

629
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:08,520
Oh, shut up!

630
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:09,688
Jeez!

631
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:17,063
JAMES: Oh! In the face!

632
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,535
JEREMY: Once James's
fuel tank had run low enough,

633
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:25,337
we pulled over
in a small village

634
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:27,706
so he could make
some repairs.

635
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,580
Well, the wind's blowing
that way, so the fireball
will go up there.

636
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:36,982
It'll be sudden, won't it,
when he goes?

637
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,150
Yeah. It's "woompf."

638
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:39,385
"Woompf,"
then a bit of quiet,

639
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,120
and then...
as all bits come down.

640
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:42,854
JEREMY: Yes.

641
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,091
Here's the split
in the tank.

642
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:47,826
- Apply this.
- Oh, hello!

643
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:50,696
You know we've been saying how
bad the roads are, Hammond?

644
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,331
Yes.

645
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:55,734
They're bad enough to kill
an un-killable car.

646
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:57,669
That's kind of
a terrifying sight,
isn't it?

647
00:33:57,736 --> 00:34:02,108
I know. I've never seen that
before in my life.

648
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:04,810
A dead Toyota pickup truck.

649
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:08,514
JEREMY:
With James's tank bodged,

650
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,483
we knuckled down to getting
some miles under our belt.

651
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,288
And for the rest of the day,

652
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:19,658
the only person
with petrol issues was me.

653
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:29,135
Right. Refuelled,
so I'm good now for 31 miles.

654
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:35,207
By the end of the day,
we'd made good progress.

655
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:37,143
And when we stopped
to make camp...

656
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:39,978
Where the bloody hell's
Giovanni?

657
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:43,515
...we were less than 100
miles from the finish line.

658
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:46,285
So, after supper, we decided
to have a conversation -

659
00:34:46,352 --> 00:34:47,886
well, argument -

660
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:51,523
about who'd built
the best beach buggy.

661
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:55,661
The point is,
yours isn't a beach buggy.

662
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:56,995
- My car?
- Yeah.

663
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,530
Apart from having
a beach buggy's body

664
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,167
and the beating,
pulsating heart
of a beach buggy,

665
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:02,501
namely a Beetle engine.

666
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:04,236
I look at yours and go,

667
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:05,971
"That doesn't even look
like a beach buggy."

668
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,274
It does and it is!
It's a beach buggy.

669
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,309
Enhanced, but in the spirit
of beach buggying.

670
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:13,912
- It isn't.
- Jeremy, yours is... a freak.

671
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:17,048
Had it existed 100 years ago,
it would have been exhibited.

672
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:20,819
People would come from miles
and children would peak at it
through curtains.

673
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:22,388
"Oh, look at the monster!"

674
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:23,589
The point is,
I have always loved

675
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,257
the spirit of the beach buggy.

676
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:27,926
I love the era that
created it and all of that.

677
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:30,329
But the one thing
that's made me not like it

678
00:35:30,396 --> 00:35:32,864
is the engine reminds me
of Hitler.

679
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:37,203
I have removed all of that
Hitler DNA from mine,

680
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:39,205
fitted a bloody great V8.

681
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:41,440
It's gone too far.

682
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:44,476
- It's Frankenstein's buggy.
- JAMES: I can settle this.

683
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:46,878
- Yours isn't
a proper beach buggy.
- It isn't.

684
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:49,748
- But it's more of
a beach buggy than yours.
- Oh, rubbish!

685
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:52,384
Because the true spirit
of the beach buggy

686
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:54,386
is the Beetle floorpan
and engine, which his has.

687
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:55,487
Yours doesn't have
the engine.

688
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:56,588
Mine actually has everything.

689
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,390
Mine is the proper beach buggy.

690
00:35:58,457 --> 00:36:00,459
- I'm sorry about this,
James, but...
- You're not.

691
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:02,428
...your car was created

692
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,630
by the swinging '60s
and endorsed by Steve McQueen,

693
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:07,299
one of the coolest people
who ever lived,

694
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:09,401
and yet, somehow,
you have managed

695
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:11,237
to make
your beach buggy boring.

696
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,904
- Rubbish
- It is a bit.

697
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:15,073
- It is boring.
- It's a boring
firework display.

698
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,344
- It is.
- It's boring
in that it works.

699
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,678
- No, James.
- It doesn't work!

700
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:21,380
The only thing
that has gone wrong

701
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:23,515
is a small leak
in the petrol tank.

702
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:25,584
Everything else about it
has constantly worked.

703
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,519
Do you know, every time
I've overtaken you,

704
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:29,321
I've looked and thought, "That's
dismal."

705
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:31,623
It isn't. It has an elegance
and a purity.

706
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,825
And when you say,
"You've never come past me,"

707
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:37,062
I come past you
every 30 miles because
you've run out of fuel.

708
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:41,400
It wheelies, the throttle
sticks, the alternator falls
off, bolts fall out of it.

709
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:45,271
- It... The alternator...
- You've had to fit a wing
on it, which ruins the looks.

710
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:47,038
It's not in the spirit
of the beach buggy,

711
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:50,309
but of a man
desperately trying
to justify a terrible idea.

712
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:52,744
- It was a brilliant idea!
- It doesn't work!

713
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:54,380
I'm fairly conscious
right now

714
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:56,515
your car is drinking the fuel
out of mine

715
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:58,450
like a sort of
plastic vampire.

716
00:36:58,517 --> 00:37:00,986
Look, mine has been thirsty.

717
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,488
- Thirsty?
- Yes.

718
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,122
JAMES: We continued arguing

719
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:08,059
until Giovanni reminded us
it was time to go to bed.

720
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:09,895
But I didn't go to bed,

721
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:14,700
because I had business
to attend to.

722
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,735
Right, Jeremy Clarkson
thinks he's being flamboyant,

723
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:19,338
and he doesn't realise that
my knowledge of aerodynamics

724
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:23,409
will trump his ability
to fit rubber penises
to people's cars.

725
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:41,993
Shit!

726
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:49,635
Hammond! Fire!

727
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,470
Help!

728
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:53,539
Hammond! Help!

729
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,747
The next morning,
as we resumed our journey,

730
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:04,350
I was feeling
rather philosophical.

731
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:07,853
I once saw an old lady
fall over

732
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:10,922
and drop her shopping bag
on the opposite side
of the road,

733
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:12,624
and her shopping fell out.

734
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:14,360
And amongst it
was an Easter egg,

735
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:17,796
which I assume she bought for
a grandchild or something,

736
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:20,566
and it rolled into the road
and got run over by a car.

737
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:24,570
It was the most tragic thing
I've ever seen...

738
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,539
until I saw the front
of my car this morning.

739
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,747
JEREMY:
And it wasn't just the front
of his own car he'd ruined.

740
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:44,623
I wouldn't mind,
but the rattling from James's
workmanship is appalling.

741
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:52,030
Despite everything, though,
we were now almost there.

742
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:54,966
Today, we would reach the
beach that marked the finish

743
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:58,169
of what had been
a spectacular journey

744
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:00,939
through
a spectacular country.

745
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,043
Oh!

746
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,112
- That deserves a stabbing.
- (LAUGHTER)

747
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:11,750
RICHARD: Oh, my God!

748
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,453
Oh!

749
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,588
(SCREAMS)

750
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,192
JEREMY: Oh, my...

751
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:23,829
Giovanni,
could you run the baths?

752
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:24,996
(YELLS)

753
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:29,134
Aargh!

754
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,503
Help!

755
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,906
JEREMY:
It really is an amazing part
of the world, this.

756
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:38,810
But everything that makes it
amazing is harsh

757
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,012
and unforgiving
and difficult.

758
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:46,051
Oh, stop!

759
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,455
No one's ever said this
before, but Namibia...

760
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:53,992
...is a beautiful bastard
of a country.

761
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:04,302
And yet,

762
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:07,773
as we counted down the last
few miles of our journey,

763
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:12,444
our home-made beach buggies
were still running.

764
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:16,882
They were battered and
bruised, but they'd proved
our point to Mr Wilman.

765
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:19,184
They'd made it.

766
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,455
And they had done
something else as well -

767
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:24,956
they'd got under our skin.

768
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,158
We liked them
even more at the end

769
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:29,961
than we had done
at the start.

770
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:32,664
I think everybody in the world
should drive a beach buggy,

771
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:36,301
because you're exposed
to so much.

772
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,736
Not just the elements,

773
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:40,706
but the opinions
of other people.

774
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,140
I mean, when you're in
a normal car,

775
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:44,610
you shake your fist
and make gestures,

776
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:45,977
and shout and yell,

777
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,747
because you feel
cocooned and safe

778
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:51,950
and immune from everybody.

779
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:55,954
But in a beach buggy,
everyone's just there.

780
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:57,756
It's brilliant!

781
00:40:57,823 --> 00:41:00,692
It's such a friendly way
of moving about.

782
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:04,129
And with that,
we settled down

783
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:08,399
for what we hoped would be
a smooth cruise to the beach.

784
00:41:08,534 --> 00:41:10,101
But it wasn't.

785
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:11,136
Ow! Ow!

786
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:13,905
Oh, God! Ow!

787
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:20,579
This is outrageous!

788
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,815
Holy shit!

789
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:28,219
Oh, no! It's gone!

790
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:32,257
And now my aerodynamics
are badly affected as well.

791
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:36,795
Oh, my word!

792
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:40,198
Jeremy is hoping
to get to the finish line

793
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:43,268
in the sort of pile of scrap
you hate your neighbours

794
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,604
for keeping at the bottom
of their garden.

795
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,275
Oh, God!

796
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:57,448
JEREMY: (LAUGHS)
Oh, no! There's petrol!

797
00:41:57,583 --> 00:42:00,786
Oh! Hammond,
don't go near his car!

798
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,188
There's petrol all over
the front of his car.

799
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,322
- Is there?
- Yeah.

800
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:05,924
RICHARD: Ooh!

801
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:08,093
JEREMY: What if it
caught fire, James?

802
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,200
With just 30 miles to go,

803
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:19,605
the mighty seven-cylinder V8
really started to play up.

804
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:21,139
(ENGINE CHUGGING)

805
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,808
- (ENGINE GRINDING)
- Oh, no!

806
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:27,646
(LAUGHS)

807
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,348
And then
it started to go dark,

808
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:33,919
which presented us with the
biggest problem of the lot.

809
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:37,288
(RICHARD LAUGHS)

810
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:39,090
That's just terrible.

811
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:41,292
Oh, God!

812
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,994
JAMES:
Well, that's marvellous.

813
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,963
JEREMY:
That one is dazzling me

814
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,232
and that one is showing me where
to go.

815
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,903
RICHARD:
This is far from ideal.

816
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,005
JEREMY:
Before pitch darkness fell,

817
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:57,709
we pulled over to do
some emergency repairs.

818
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:59,477
I'm gonna put some...

819
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:02,714
tape of a certain well-known
brand on the problem.

820
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,117
JEREMY:
Finger tight will do.

821
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:09,154
These repairs
were extremely successful.

822
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,161
Oh, it's swung into my face!

823
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:19,330
No, I can't see a thing.
Agh! That's worse!

824
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,269
Oh, God. Now they've turned.

825
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:27,038
Oh, no! My car's gone
cross-eyed again!

826
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,977
JEREMY: There's a man
coming the other way.

827
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:33,578
What's he gonna think of us?

828
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:34,880
(LAUGHS) I don't know.

829
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,948
I can't see a bloody thing.

830
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:41,186
Thank you.
Oh, that's good!

831
00:43:41,252 --> 00:43:43,421
It's shaken the headlight
back round again!

832
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:46,992
Yeah! No, it's back again.
Oh, just for a moment.

833
00:43:48,694 --> 00:43:53,331
Then the rough road brought
some new headlight problems.

834
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:56,267
Oh, nothing! Oh, no!
Nothing! Nothing!

835
00:43:56,334 --> 00:44:00,005
I've got...
I've now got nothing at all.

836
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:02,240
OK, Hammond and May,
can you just let me know

837
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,876
what your lighting
situation is now?

838
00:44:04,943 --> 00:44:08,814
RICHARD: As long as I hold
the flash lever back,
I have light.

839
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,851
JAMES: If I hold the lever,
I get one light
and one flashing light, yes.

840
00:44:12,918 --> 00:44:16,154
But I have to take
my hand off to change gear.

841
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:18,824
JEREMY: And then Hammond's
car suddenly turned into

842
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,192
the lighting rig
at a Pink Floyd gig.

843
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,496
Why does it keep changing?
What...

844
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:26,865
And it's all got...

845
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:29,434
(GASPS)

846
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:35,373
It's only three kilometres
to go now. Three.

847
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:39,811
Ahh!

848
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:41,880
Oh, (BLEEP) hell!

849
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:44,282
Gone. Coming back.

850
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:47,786
Although we couldn't see,

851
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:50,989
we knew we must be close
to the beach.

852
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:53,158
It's not... you know,
a seaside beach.

853
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:56,427
It must be on a river
or a lake, or something.

854
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:01,833
This is uphill.
I'm sure that's wrong.

855
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:06,171
That's a big drop there.

856
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:08,874
I don't want to go off there.

857
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,176
JEREMY: I'm not sure
this is sensible.

858
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:14,913
Nowhere in any guide
I've ever read does it say,

859
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,549
"Explore new territory
in a beach buggy

860
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:21,853
with your lights all broken."

861
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,891
Unable to find anything even
remotely resembling a beach,

862
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:27,793
we pulled over.

863
00:45:27,793 --> 00:45:29,627
(WATER RUSHING)

864
00:45:29,694 --> 00:45:32,864
We cannot carry on
just plunging around
in the darkness,

865
00:45:32,931 --> 00:45:34,332
hoping to find the beach.

866
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,201
And, anyway,
what is that noise?

867
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:42,573
RICHARD: I would say
that...is a waterfall.

868
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,943
Is it something you want
to come across in the dark?

869
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:48,013
Because the other thing
I'd say about that sound -

870
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,449
it might be my imagination,
but that sounds as though
it's coming from below,

871
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:52,818
like we're above it.

872
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:54,219
We have climbed up
that track.

873
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:56,521
And a waterfall is a drop,
by definition.

874
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,890
If we're...
I don't want to...
in the dark.

875
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:01,392
Abandon. I'm not doing it.

876
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:03,528
We'll do it tomorrow. Sun.

877
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,431
Let's look at the stars
and have one more night
in Namibia.

878
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,733
We'll find it tomorrow
and it'll be fantastically
glorious.

879
00:46:08,834 --> 00:46:09,835
RICHARD:
Tomorrow on the beach.

880
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:12,203
JEREMY: Giovanni!

881
00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:20,411
The next morning,
daylight brought answers
to our questions.

882
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,215
So it wasn't a waterfall.

883
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,651
No, it was many waterfalls.

884
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:28,053
Hundreds of waterfalls.

885
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,729
And they were just part
of what we all agreed

886
00:46:38,864 --> 00:46:43,902
was the most beautiful view
we'd ever seen.

887
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,715
But...many waterfalls.

888
00:46:57,782 --> 00:46:59,517
No beach that I can see.

889
00:47:02,988 --> 00:47:04,722
Does that count as a beach?

890
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:05,891
JEREMY: That is a beach.

891
00:47:05,891 --> 00:47:07,658
JAMES: I'd call that a beach.

892
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:10,728
- The beach.
- That's got to be it.
There's no others.

893
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:13,899
Gentlemen,
our quest is at an end.

894
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:16,734
Let us ride...

895
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:20,471
in splendour... to...

896
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:22,941
- I'm not finishing that
very well. What is it?
- It's very moving.

897
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:26,611
I'm trying to think
of something evocative
and Victorian and brilliant.

898
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,813
RICHARD: "Let's go over there
and finish our journey"?

899
00:47:28,914 --> 00:47:30,648
No, that's Brummie rubbish!

900
00:47:30,715 --> 00:47:32,683
- It is!
- It's the fact.

901
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:36,587
JEREMY:
Unable to find the right
words to mark the moment...

902
00:47:36,654 --> 00:47:38,123
...we set off anyway.

903
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:43,061
Yeah, this is it.

904
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:49,334
We are half a kilometre
from our objective.

905
00:47:53,638 --> 00:47:54,940
Oh.

906
00:47:55,006 --> 00:47:57,608
Oh, no. Path ends. Path ends.

907
00:47:58,843 --> 00:48:00,378
Erm...

908
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:04,549
Oh, my God!

909
00:48:07,152 --> 00:48:08,519
Well, if this won't get
over there,

910
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:10,088
there's no way will theirs.

911
00:48:13,158 --> 00:48:16,261
JEREMY: We split up
to look for a path
through the rocks...

912
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:19,497
JAMES: Oh, no!

913
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:22,333
...but it was hopeless.

914
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,368
Forget it.

915
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:26,337
Hammond, forget it.

916
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,473
We aren't going down
this hill.

917
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:35,580
The problem is, even if we
could get over this stuff,
which we can't...

918
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,215
RICHARD: No, we can't.

919
00:48:37,282 --> 00:48:39,985
...have you seen what's
between us and the beach?

920
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:43,989
Look at it. There's no way
you could drive over that
or anywhere near.

921
00:48:44,022 --> 00:48:46,524
- Look,
you can't even go inland.
- No, we can't go there.

922
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,293
And you can't go
around that mountain

923
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,428
and come at it from the back,
cos they're cliffs.

924
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:58,469
Wait a minute.

925
00:48:58,536 --> 00:49:00,505
What?

926
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:01,672
I've had...

927
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,142
...a great idea.

928
00:49:04,209 --> 00:49:07,078
- RICHARD: Oh, no.
- No.

929
00:49:07,145 --> 00:49:10,181
So we can't drive over here.

930
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:15,620
But we have to get us
and our cars to that beach
over there.

931
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:20,191
If there were to be
some kind of...

932
00:49:20,258 --> 00:49:23,428
A mounting point on that
cliff, maybe, and then--

933
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:24,429
Do what?

934
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:26,564
No.
Mounting point down there.

935
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:28,466
Over that distance?
That's a huge distance.

936
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:30,068
- It's about half a kilometre.
- No!

937
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:31,802
But can you imagine
the forces on it?

938
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:34,339
- The things at the end
are gonna have to be...
- Huge.

939
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:37,508
- Massive.
- Jeremy, we don't all live
in a cartoon.

940
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:39,344
We will die! Dead!

941
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:45,050
RICHARD: Given that
there were no alternatives,

942
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:46,917
we had to go with
the ape's plan,

943
00:49:47,052 --> 00:49:52,457
which was to turn our beach
buggies into cable cars.

944
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:55,893
- That's over two metres.
- Yeah, that's good enough.

945
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,064
So we headed to
a nearby abandoned mine...

946
00:50:00,398 --> 00:50:02,200
...to scavenge materials.

947
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:06,804
JAMES: Is that bit any good?

948
00:50:06,871 --> 00:50:10,941
- How much more of that cable
have we got?
- Four drums.

949
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:14,345
- Are you proposing that
that becomes a winding drum?
- Yeah.

950
00:50:14,412 --> 00:50:16,881
It's very important...

951
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:20,718
we get as much
weight as possible
into Hammond's car...

952
00:50:20,785 --> 00:50:23,188
for erm...
well, for your amusement.

954
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:30,061

(CLANGING AND GRUNTING)

956
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,404
- JAMES: How much do you want?
- JEREMY: 30 metres.

957
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:48,779
James, have you got that hoop
welded in yet?

958
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:50,148
No, that's my next job.

959
00:50:55,153 --> 00:50:56,921
RICHARD: Several days later,

960
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,657
and with absolutely no help
whatsoever

961
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:04,028
from any Namibian
mining engineers...

962
00:51:04,129 --> 00:51:08,266
...the world's first
beach buggy cable car
was ready, and--

963
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:10,034
JEREMY:
Shit! Stop, everybody!

964
00:51:10,135 --> 00:51:13,003
The goats are eating the tree
that we've anchored it to.

965
00:51:13,138 --> 00:51:15,473
- Shoo, goats! Shoo!
- (BLEATING)

966
00:51:18,343 --> 00:51:20,578
They were eating the tree.

967
00:51:20,645 --> 00:51:22,447
RICHARD:
Anyway, as I was saying,

968
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:24,949
it stretched for more
than a third of a mile.

969
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:27,885
And since the drop to
the crocodile-infested river

970
00:51:27,952 --> 00:51:30,155
was several hundred feet,

971
00:51:30,188 --> 00:51:32,323
we decided
James should go first.

972
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:34,825
- We had a vote.
- Did you?

973
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:36,861
We did, and we were unanimous
you were going first.

974
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,729
Right, so it's become
a democracy all of a sudden?

975
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:40,665
- JEREMY: Yes, it has.
- RICHARD: Yeah.

976
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:42,300
And anyway,
your car's the lightest,

977
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:43,868
now you've burned half
of it away.

978
00:51:46,171 --> 00:51:49,174
I'm climbing in.

Is he drinking?

983
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,191
...and then simply drove off
the launch pad.

It's really high!
I'm turning the engine off.

988
00:52:16,201 --> 00:52:18,269
- RICHARD: We had to test it.
- JEREMY: Well, exactly.

989
00:52:18,336 --> 00:52:21,406
- He had to go first.
- Don't look at us
and think we're bad.

990
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:24,008
Because that was
scientifically vigorous.

- OK.
- He doesn't like us.

the cable buggy kept on
chugging through

what's technically Angolan
airspace towards the beach.

1001
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,148
God, I'm nearly there!

1003
00:53:06,851 --> 00:53:08,886
Neutral. Handbrake off.

He's gonna do it.

1005
00:53:11,322 --> 00:53:12,623
I'm at the end!

- JEREMY: He's down.
- RICHARD: That's a landing.

1007
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:19,864
Yes!

1008
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,632
- Do you know what, though?
- What?

1009
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,501
- I'm doing maths here.
- Mm?

1010
00:53:23,568 --> 00:53:26,871
One of us is gonna be killed
doing this, obviously, yes?

1011
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:30,875
- I'd say so, yeah.
- So when we were all here,
33% chance.

1012
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:33,644
Now I'm doing it
with a 50% chance.

1013
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:35,346
- Now you're doing it?
- I'm going next.

1014
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:37,315
- I can go next.
- You can't go next.

00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:39,850
- Why can't I go next?
- (CREAKING)

1016
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:43,421
JEREMY: Whilst James
toasted his success
with some more drink...

1017
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:48,693
...I won the argument
and prepared for launch.

1018
00:53:49,627 --> 00:53:51,829
Why is my car at this angle?

1019
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:55,300
Well, maybe because
there's a massive V8
hanging out the back of it.

1020
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,802
Right! Right, right, right!

1021
00:53:57,868 --> 00:53:59,036
I'll... here we go.

1022
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:00,405
(ENGINE STARTS)

1023
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:05,943
(GROANS)

1024
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:13,784
My rectum has just opened
like a set of theatre
curtains.

1025
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:16,621
And for good reason,
because my beach buggy

1026
00:54:16,687 --> 00:54:21,392
weighed 200 kilograms more
than James's charred wreck.

1027
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:27,465
Ooh! Ooh!
He brushed the grass!

1028
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,503
I'm terrified,
I'll be honest,

1029
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:35,340
but, for the first time
since I set off,

1030
00:54:35,373 --> 00:54:37,342
I'm comfortable
in my beach buggy.

1031
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:44,815
(METALLIC CLUNK)

1032
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:52,457
Approaching the beach.
Approaching the end
of the journey.

1033
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:53,824
Here I come.

1034
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:57,828
And... touchdown!

1035
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:00,365
Yes!

1036
00:55:00,365 --> 00:55:03,100
JEREMY: Bad news, Hammond. I've
made it.

1037
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,702
Oh, great.

1038
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:08,373
- Sir?
- Oh, I say, James!

1039
00:55:08,373 --> 00:55:10,608
JEREMY: Actually, I was lucky
there was some left,

1040
00:55:10,675 --> 00:55:14,379
because James had had
a bit of a thirst on
whilst he'd been alone.

1041
00:55:14,379 --> 00:55:15,846
(GRUNTS)

1042
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:17,214
Hello, guys down there.

1043
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:19,550
It's Richard at the top.

1044
00:55:19,617 --> 00:55:21,919
Right, I'm gonna do this now,
so goodbye.

1045
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:28,593
Oh!
I don't like that feeling!

1046
00:55:29,694 --> 00:55:32,029
(GROANS)

1047
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:33,698
(GROANING CONTINUES)

1048
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:36,601
Here he comes,
ladies and gentlemen,
Richard Hammond.

1049
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:39,003
(GRUNTS) No!

1050
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,008
I could take solace from
the fact that this system

1051
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:47,878
has already run twice with
their cars and not failed -
it's been tested.

1052
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:49,947
Or I could take
a more realistic view,

1053
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:54,719
which is that
those two fat oafs
have already weakened it.

1054
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:57,021
JEREMY: Plus he had all
that scrap metal in the back,

1055
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:59,457
which is why
all eyes were on him.

1056
00:55:59,524 --> 00:56:01,792
Well, when I say "all"...

1057
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:04,895
Look at the colours
in those rocks over there.

1058
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:07,498
It's... It's fantastic.

1059
00:56:07,565 --> 00:56:09,700
Just to the left
of where Hammond is.

1060
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:15,440
Why's my car sitting so low?
It is heavy.

1061
00:56:15,506 --> 00:56:17,274
It is... Why's it lower?

1062
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:20,110
- The colouring
is fabulous, isn't it?
- Yeah, they are.

1063
00:56:24,181 --> 00:56:27,685
RICHARD:
Despite all my fears,
the cables were holding

1064
00:56:27,752 --> 00:56:31,288
and drawing me ever closer
to my colleagues.

1065
00:56:31,355 --> 00:56:33,691
This is it.
I can see the beach.

1066
00:56:33,758 --> 00:56:35,793
I'm so nearly there.
We are gonna do it!

1067
00:56:37,462 --> 00:56:38,863
Come on, Hammond. Come on.

1068
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:43,167
I'm gonna do it.

1069
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,069
Come on, Hammond. Come on.

1070
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:46,504
(CREAKING)

1071
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:47,672
(METALLIC CLUNK)

1072
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,474
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)

1073
00:56:49,507 --> 00:56:50,775
Oh.

1074
00:56:53,478 --> 00:56:55,012
Erm...

1075
00:56:57,014 --> 00:56:58,483
Why have I stopped?

1076
00:56:58,483 --> 00:56:59,917
- JEREMY: Hammond!
- JAMES: Come on!

1077
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:02,152
- RICHARD: I've stopped!
- JEREMY: Hammond!

1078
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:03,854
It's just stopped!

1079
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:05,690
What can I do?
It's just stopped!

1080
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:08,759
There's, like,
200 metres to go!

1081
00:57:08,826 --> 00:57:11,829
I don't have anything to do
with it! It's not up to me!

1082
00:57:11,896 --> 00:57:14,765
Is there nothing you can do?

1083
00:57:14,832 --> 00:57:16,834
Sadly, James was
too drunk to think,

1084
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:18,569
and I'm mechanically inept.

1085
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:22,507
Plus, whatever had gone wrong
had gone wrong at the top,

1086
00:57:22,573 --> 00:57:24,374
and we were at the bottom.

1087
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:25,976
Move! Move! Move!

1088
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:28,112
There's literally
nothing we can do.

1089
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:29,547
We've assessed everything

1090
00:57:29,614 --> 00:57:31,616
and you're in
a hopeless position.

1091
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:35,119
We could have another beer.

1092
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:42,392
We've gonna have to conclude,
I'm afraid,

1093
00:57:42,527 --> 00:57:47,164
that Mr Wilman was right that
the beach buggy is no good.

1094
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:50,801
And on that
terrible disappointment,
it's time to end.

1095
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:53,571
Thank you so much
for watching. Good night.
