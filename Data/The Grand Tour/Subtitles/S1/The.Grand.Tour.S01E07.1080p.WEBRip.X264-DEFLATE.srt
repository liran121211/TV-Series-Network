00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:23,758
Hello and welcome to
a Grand Tour special,

2
00:00:23,783 --> 00:00:26,712
which begins with this
the Volkswagen Beetle.

3
00:00:26,737 --> 00:00:28,815
It's a car we hate very much

4
00:00:28,876 --> 00:00:32,040
because it appeals only
to Nazis and hippies,

5
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:35,173
and we are neither
of those things.

6
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,853
However,
if you remove the bodywork

7
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:40,290
and replace it with something
a bit more fun -

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,572
something like this...

9
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,728
You end up with a beach buggy,

10
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:45,767
and that's brilliant.

11
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:47,548
We love beach buggies.

12
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:49,861
However, Mr. Wilman disagrees.

13
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:52,220
He says that
if they'd been any good,

14
00:00:52,322 --> 00:00:53,775
they would have caught on,

15
00:00:53,876 --> 00:00:56,227
and he points out
that they didn't.

16
00:00:56,306 --> 00:01:00,103
So he hatched a plan.
And it's this:

17
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:03,662
he said all three of us
must buy a Volkswagen Beetle,

18
00:01:03,795 --> 00:01:05,709
turn it into a beach buggy,

19
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,200
and then report with it

20
00:01:07,302 --> 00:01:11,443
to a wild, rugged
and extremely remote place...

21
00:01:11,537 --> 00:01:15,170
Here... on the coast of Namibia.

22
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:40,560
This is what I've built.

23
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,178
It's as close
as you can possibly get

24
00:01:44,248 --> 00:01:47,482
to the original 1964 beach buggy

25
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:49,160
built by Bruce Meyers.

26
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:55,833
Underneath,
it is a 1950s Beetle...

27
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,802
Beetle floorpan,
Beetle suspension,

28
00:01:57,888 --> 00:01:59,623
Beetle engine, Beetle gearbox.

29
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,905
It's got Beetle lights on it.

30
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:02,521
I've even got
a Beetle speedometer

31
00:02:02,575 --> 00:02:04,443
and Beetle hubcaps.

32
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,635
It's brilliant!

33
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:14,966
This is a beach buggy very like
the one that Steve McQueen drove

34
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:16,693
in the original
Thomas Crown Affair.

35
00:02:16,747 --> 00:02:18,731
And if it's good enough...

36
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:22,060
- Oh, God.
- Ha-ha!

37
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:25,095
I've been joined by the 1970s.

38
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:30,535
Yes.

39
00:02:30,665 --> 00:02:34,939
James May has built
what a beach buggy was,

40
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:38,876
what I've built is what
a beach buggy can be...

41
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:43,649
if you have a bit of imagination

42
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:46,680
and some purple
metal-flake paint.

43
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:48,555
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

44
00:02:54,305 --> 00:02:58,540
There, I believe, is the start
point of our adventure.

45
00:03:04,962 --> 00:03:07,157
What an extraordinary place.

46
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:10,708
It's amazing, isn't it?
I mean, more seals.

47
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:13,344
What David Attenborough
never told us about those

48
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,946
is how bad they smell.

49
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,388
Sadly, before our nature
documentary could go any further,

50
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:23,930
Richard Hammond
emerged from the mist.

51
00:03:24,134 --> 00:03:27,191
Ooh, hello.
That's not a beach buggy.

52
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,227
- Is it?
- Well, I wouldn't call that...

53
00:03:30,532 --> 00:03:32,446
- Ah-ha!
- Oh, geez.

54
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,899
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dick-Tari!

55
00:03:35,277 --> 00:03:36,688
Behold!

56
00:03:37,548 --> 00:03:38,770
What are you wearing?

57
00:03:38,836 --> 00:03:40,154
What are you wearing?

58
00:03:40,205 --> 00:03:41,763
Well, I'm in Africa!

59
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,115
These trousers,

60
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:44,646
did they say in the shop,

61
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:46,326
"I'm afraid
they are yellow, sir"?

62
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,716
When you left, they went, "Yes!

63
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:50,584
20 years we've had
those on the hanger!"

64
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:51,388
Shut up.

65
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:53,209
And then we must
move over to this.

66
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:54,795
- Yeah.
- We were told

67
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:56,653
to build beach buggies.

68
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:58,396
- Yes.
- Beach buggies.

69
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:00,115
- It's not a beach buggy.
- It isn't.

70
00:04:00,162 --> 00:04:01,607
It is a beach buggy.

71
00:04:01,677 --> 00:04:03,802
It isn't a beach buggy.
It's got a roof!

72
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:05,654
There's no Beetle
in here at all.

73
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:07,829
Yes, there is.
Beetle engine in there.

74
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:10,876
OK, this space-frame chassis...

75
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:12,641
- Yeah.
- Is it from a Beetle?

76
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:15,352
- No.
- These enormous suspension components

77
00:04:15,383 --> 00:04:17,969
Yes, That don't even fit
under the bodywork.

78
00:04:18,146 --> 00:04:21,533
- You've got two lots of suspension at the back.
- Twin shocks.

79
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:25,285
<i>- Twin shocks?
- Well, you know... - I like an off-road sort of vibe.</i>

80
00:04:25,353 --> 00:04:27,521
To get here,
we had to drive on a beach.

81
00:04:27,715 --> 00:04:29,176
- Yeah.
- Ours have made it.

82
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:32,018
I didn't need two lots
of rear suspension on mine.

83
00:04:32,043 --> 00:04:32,791
Neither did I.

84
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:34,777
Look, we were told
to come to Africa.

85
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:39,560
If we'd been told to go to Santa
Monica Beach, then this, with its...

86
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:42,060
incredibly vivid paint...

87
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,037
That's the most metal flake
I've ever seen.

88
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:45,350
Any beach in the world.

89
00:04:45,393 --> 00:04:47,027
Um...

90
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:50,021
- H-Hang on, what's that?
- That's the engine.

91
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:52,264
- What engine is it?
- V8!

92
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:54,310
I've put a V8 in a beach buggy!

93
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:55,678
Well, no, you haven't.

94
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:57,584
You've parked your
beach buggy quite close.

95
00:04:57,646 --> 00:04:58,631
It's not in it!

96
00:04:58,656 --> 00:05:00,076
- It isn't in it.
- No.

97
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,334
You've reversed into a V8,

98
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,600
but not quite hard enough.

99
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,921
It's only gone in
a third of the way.

100
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:06,145
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is

101
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,030
to fit a V8 to a beach buggy?

102
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:09,368
- Well, it doesn't fit!
- It's obviously impossible.

103
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,154
Exactly, it's impossible.

104
00:05:11,232 --> 00:05:12,842
This is no ordinary V8.

105
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,303
It started out in life

106
00:05:14,328 --> 00:05:16,607
as a 3.5 litre V8
from a Range Rover,

107
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:21,609
but I've modified it, so it
produces 180 horsepower.

108
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,654
Can I just say,
you were doubting

109
00:05:23,712 --> 00:05:25,150
the credibility of mine
as a beach buggy.

110
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:26,139
Yeah. Yeah.

111
00:05:26,164 --> 00:05:28,485
The defining characteristic
of a beach buggy

112
00:05:28,547 --> 00:05:32,196
is an air-cooled,
flat-four Beetle engine.

113
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:33,828
No, that's not an engine, James.

114
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:34,923
That's just a fan.

115
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:36,531
How many horsepower
does yours have?

116
00:05:36,617 --> 00:05:37,789
94!

117
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:39,781
So I have twice
as many horsepower.

118
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,743
- Shall I tell you something?
- They're not in the car, though.

119
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:43,564
- They are, they're near it.
- Yes.

120
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:45,457
It's interesting, isn't it?
I mean, that is an entire...

121
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:47,065
Nothing about that
is interesting.

122
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,268
Well, This is a blank canvas

123
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:49,651
onto which you could
paint your personality.

124
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:50,870
- Yes.
- Yours has got

125
00:05:50,895 --> 00:05:52,908
a prolapsed V8 hanging
out of its backside

126
00:05:53,024 --> 00:05:54,331
and terrible paint.

127
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,776
Mine is a rather magnificent

128
00:05:55,878 --> 00:05:57,401
"Daktari" -themed off-roader.

129
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:59,613
That's got nothing on it!

130
00:05:59,815 --> 00:06:02,015
- You can express... All your personality,
- It is a bit boring.

131
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,039
And it's standard.

132
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:04,377
It's not...
What do you mean, standard?

133
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:05,504
- Its standard.
- A beach buggy.

134
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:06,896
It's tasteful.

135
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:08,241
What?

136
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:12,066
- Oh.
- The bat sat-phone.

137
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,399
We've got a message from...

138
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:15,830
Mr. Wilman.

139
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:17,165
Right, go on.

140
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:18,551
"Since you're in
beach buggies..."

141
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:20,337
Well, us two are.

142
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,203
"Since you're in beach buggies,

143
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,969
you will now
drive to the beach."

144
00:06:25,157 --> 00:06:26,507
Uh...

145
00:06:26,557 --> 00:06:27,658
Uh... do you think

146
00:06:27,697 --> 00:06:29,366
he's taken leave of his senses?

147
00:06:29,452 --> 00:06:31,115
Well, he was never that good
at geography, was he?

148
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,174
No, he wasn't. "You'll now
drive to the beach."

149
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,445
Hold on.
Oh, no, there's more.

150
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:36,417
"The beach
to which you will drive

151
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:41,734
is located on the
crocodile-infested Kunene River

152
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:46,234
at the northernmost point of
Namibia, where it meets Angola.

153
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:48,749
It's 1,000 miles away."

154
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:53,218
- 1,000 miles?
- 1,000.

155
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,437
What we needed
at this point was a map,

156
00:06:56,577 --> 00:06:59,616
so we decided
to head north up the coast

157
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:01,640
and find the nearest town.

158
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:04,124
Let the journey begin!

159
00:07:08,215 --> 00:07:11,070
And what a journey
it would be in these cars,

160
00:07:11,117 --> 00:07:14,976
cars that were born
in interesting times.

161
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:19,546
So, it's 1964,

162
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:22,496
the word "teenager"
has started to appear

163
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:24,124
in the world's dictionaries,

164
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:26,868
people are listening
to new types of music,

165
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:29,945
they're smoking
new types of stuff.

166
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,275
And then, in California,
the beach buggy arrived!

167
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:40,999
It was perfect!

168
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,651
Girls and boys,
beach barbecues...

169
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:47,221
The first design criteria was
that the front fenders were flat,

170
00:07:47,318 --> 00:07:49,389
so you could stand a beer on it.

171
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:51,359
That's how you design a car!

172
00:07:55,163 --> 00:07:59,452
Jimi Hendrix had a beach buggy
and President Nixon didn't.

173
00:07:59,603 --> 00:08:01,572
Tells you all you need to know.

174
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:07,812
What I really like about the beach
buggy is that it's a testament

175
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:11,312
to the ability of
the human spirit to triumph.

176
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:13,323
Because somebody looked
at the Beetle and said,

177
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:17,577
"Well, that's the legacy of
the world's worst dictator.

178
00:08:17,687 --> 00:08:19,812
Let's turn it
into a beach car."

179
00:08:23,374 --> 00:08:25,118
After a lonely hour

180
00:08:25,193 --> 00:08:27,328
of driving north
through the swirling mist,

181
00:08:27,395 --> 00:08:29,905
we still hadn't found a town,

182
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:33,161
but we did find something else.

183
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,832
Jesus.

184
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,851
I'll tell you what,

185
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,859
he must have been
going at a right old lick

186
00:08:59,913 --> 00:09:00,928
when he hit the beach.

187
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:02,437
He must have been.

188
00:09:02,796 --> 00:09:04,217
Right, the sea is there.

189
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:05,640
That's half a mile away.

190
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:06,677
I'd say so.

191
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:07,952
So he got it up the beach,

192
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:09,457
and then sort of did
a handbrake turn.

193
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,760
- Power-slided it in.
- How do you do a handbrake...

194
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:14,148
How did it get here, seriously?

195
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,531
Can I just say...
my nipples are erect.

196
00:09:17,695 --> 00:09:19,788
- What, 'cause of this jacket?
- No.

197
00:09:19,898 --> 00:09:20,949
- Oh.
- It's cold.

198
00:09:20,982 --> 00:09:22,929
- It is, isn't it?
- It's cold.

199
00:09:23,014 --> 00:09:25,709
That's an unwise
wardrobe strategy.

200
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,874
Yeah, well, you know,

201
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:28,937
Africa, on a beach, I thought...

202
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:30,991
- So did I.
- I'm surprised.

203
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:35,366
The beach has got
the sea haar on it -

204
00:09:35,522 --> 00:09:38,070
mist, fog, cold.

205
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,632
- If you look over there...
- Hm.

206
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:42,336
Sunshine, blue sky.

207
00:09:42,476 --> 00:09:45,296
- Why don't we just go inland...
- The coast road.

208
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:47,765
Find the coast road which
will take us to a town.

209
00:09:47,835 --> 00:09:50,304
And that'll be in the sun.
That's a better idea.

210
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,646
With a plan worked out,

211
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,060
it was time to get moving again.

212
00:09:59,485 --> 00:10:00,786
Oh, dear.

213
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,068
Did you modify
the battery as well?

214
00:10:03,263 --> 00:10:05,021
Oh...

215
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:07,787
- It's obviously not charging up.
- No.

216
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,709
Because I didn't modify it.

217
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,123
Yeah.

218
00:10:11,288 --> 00:10:13,162
I'll just see if mine works.

219
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:16,943
- Oh, yeah.
- Let me just try mine.

220
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:19,073
Yeah.

221
00:10:19,623 --> 00:10:21,209
- Push?
- Hm?

222
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,037
Can I have a push?

223
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:34,288
After the film crew
had got me going,

224
00:10:34,355 --> 00:10:38,292
I used my massive horsepower
to catch the others.

225
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:48,052
But by the time we were
back together again...

226
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,771
it was going dark.

227
00:10:51,006 --> 00:10:54,638
The sun, as you can see
over my shoulder, has set,

228
00:10:54,873 --> 00:10:57,045
and we still
haven't found a road.

229
00:10:57,111 --> 00:11:00,575
It's also going to be very,
very, very cold.

230
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,330
Lights on.

231
00:11:10,994 --> 00:11:13,357
We have got to find this road.

232
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:16,372
This is not going to be
too clever...

233
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,583
in the dark.

234
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:27,474
I've rather crudely
rigged up my torch,

235
00:11:27,614 --> 00:11:30,244
wedged in the windscreen rail,

236
00:11:30,364 --> 00:11:34,591
in the hope that you can see
my last pieces to camera.

237
00:11:38,152 --> 00:11:39,904
Oh, bollocks!

238
00:11:44,158 --> 00:11:45,841
Oh, cold!

239
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:50,599
Finally, though,

240
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:53,122
it looked like
our luck had changed.

241
00:11:53,257 --> 00:11:55,124
Ooh, hello! Hello!

242
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,146
What's that?

243
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:06,013
- It's not a hotel.
- No.

244
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,513
It smells of excrement!

245
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,810
Oh, wow, look at this!

246
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:12,419
There's still, like, plates

247
00:12:12,444 --> 00:12:14,505
and cups and saucers
and things in here.

248
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:16,083
I'll tell you exactly
what this is.

249
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:17,802
It's an abandoned mine.

250
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:20,856
They do mine round
in Namibia, don't they?

251
00:12:20,892 --> 00:12:21,892
What do they mine for?

252
00:12:21,994 --> 00:12:23,607
- Diamonds.
- Diamonds?

253
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,378
Yeah, but they wouldn't
have left if there were any.

254
00:12:26,634 --> 00:12:29,318
They obviously left,
and not yesterday.

255
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,693
Look, there's no road here,
is there?

256
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:35,693
- No.
- No.

257
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:37,239
Apart from anything else,

258
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,872
we can't find our way
around in the dark

259
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,700
'cause we can't navigate.

260
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,364
- Well, I can.
- How?

261
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:43,208
- How?
- Stars.

262
00:12:43,351 --> 00:12:44,896
- No, you can't.
- I can.

263
00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:47,747
I can't do very many
things, I admit...

264
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:49,864
anything, but I can do that.

265
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,618
How do you navigate
by the stars?

266
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:53,239
Uh...
find the Southern Cross.

267
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:54,895
Yeah, but that's
really complicated.

268
00:12:54,962 --> 00:12:57,294
Right, do you want to sleep
in the excrement mine?

269
00:12:57,396 --> 00:12:58,786
No, this is out.

270
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,193
So, we have to keep going,

271
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:02,809
whether we like it or not,
till we find...

272
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,607
We have to, so listen.

273
00:13:04,716 --> 00:13:07,388
I shall find the Southern Cross.

274
00:13:07,677 --> 00:13:09,115
You can't find the Southern
Cross with a hammer.

275
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:12,771
I've found it! Ha! I've found it.
It's there.

276
00:13:12,913 --> 00:13:13,913
It's like a kite.

277
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:15,883
- That one there?
- Yeah.

278
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,241
It's a kite shape.
It's sort of...

279
00:13:17,265 --> 00:13:20,951
Now, you take
the long axis, yes?

280
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:21,905
- Yes.
- Mm-hm.

281
00:13:21,983 --> 00:13:24,256
And draw an imaginary line

282
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:27,280
through it, down to the horizon.

283
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:29,608
Yes? Now, you intersect it

284
00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:32,412
from a line drawn
between two other stars,

285
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:35,211
and where those
two imaginary lines meet,

286
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,781
directly underneath it
is due south.

287
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:40,816
So if it's those two...

288
00:13:40,883 --> 00:13:42,733
Which it is, I'm sure of it...

289
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,654
You draw a line...

290
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:52,562
Oh, this is a bad idea!

291
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:55,459
We are now trusting
our lives to an orangutan

292
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,346
who thinks he's Patrick Moore.

293
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:03,099
There it is.
There's the two stars.

294
00:14:04,201 --> 00:14:06,876
Draw a line...

295
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,841
I'm not getting many directions
from you, Jeremy. Is this right?

296
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:13,083
You're heading a little bit
too much to the right.

297
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:15,263
You need to go left a bit.

298
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:18,513
Good, good.
Oh, I'm so confident.

299
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:23,927
You two are going to be eating
humble pie when the sun comes up.

300
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,998
Despite the confidence

301
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:31,060
of Jeremy Columbus,

302
00:14:31,176 --> 00:14:33,546
no road appeared.

303
00:14:34,593 --> 00:14:36,341
Oh, this is grim.

304
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:42,478
Excuse me.

305
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,919
I've been on the go
a very, very long time now.

306
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:52,451
Guys, I'm sorry.
I'm not driving another inch.

307
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:54,157
I can't do this.

308
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:55,658
It's three o'clock
in the morning.

309
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:57,373
I'm exhausted.

310
00:14:58,001 --> 00:15:00,503
He does have a point.

311
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:07,503
The next morning,

312
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,365
we woke, having
slept on the sand,

313
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:12,808
huddled round our engines
for warmth.

314
00:15:41,404 --> 00:15:43,902
You muppet. What's that?

315
00:15:43,953 --> 00:15:44,954
Um...

316
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:48,178
"Um" what?

317
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:51,247
I never knew
Namibia had two seas.

318
00:15:51,314 --> 00:15:52,682
It doesn't have two seas.

319
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:54,350
No, it has one
massive "cee" in it.

320
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:55,818
One massive, stupid "cee"

321
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:57,820
that's navigated us back
to where we started.

322
00:15:57,887 --> 00:15:59,889
- Can I just say...
- It wasn't my... I...

323
00:15:59,955 --> 00:16:02,255
Why did we even believe you
could navigate by the stars?

324
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,661
You can't even read a compass.

325
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:06,083
There are two "cees".
There's two "cees" here

326
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:08,302
for believing that
that "cee" could navigate us.

327
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,615
- No, you're right.
- I couldn't possibly...

328
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:13,286
Really, I don't understand that.

329
00:16:13,365 --> 00:16:15,693
Freezing cold,
sandpapered on the face...

330
00:16:15,747 --> 00:16:18,677
- You've got a coat on.
- It's thin. Have you felt it?

331
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,599
I haven't even got a thin coat.

332
00:16:20,693 --> 00:16:21,905
I've only got
a T-shirt. Anyway,

333
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:23,677
I'm not going to be
competitive with you

334
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:24,943
about who's the coldest.

335
00:16:24,982 --> 00:16:27,263
- I'm the coldest!
- We're all the lostest.

336
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,302
Never mind. Look,
let's not get bogged down

337
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:30,568
with whose fault it was.

338
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,589
There's no being bogged
down with it, is there?

339
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:34,294
It was yours.

340
00:16:34,474 --> 00:16:36,242
We can either go
back into the desert

341
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:37,724
to look for a road,

342
00:16:37,794 --> 00:16:40,169
or we can just do what
we were doing yesterday,

343
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,075
and stay on the beach.

344
00:16:42,177 --> 00:16:44,250
At least we know, if we
keep the sea on our left,

345
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:45,622
we're going north.

346
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:47,115
- Yes.
- That's a fair point.

347
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:49,522
- Let's navigate by the sea.
- Yes.

348
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:53,393
With our new...
Well, newish...

349
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,490
Plan in place,

350
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,544
we set off once more.

351
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:02,607
So here we are. These are our
wheel marks from yesterday.

352
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:06,673
24 hours of cold, misery...

353
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:08,857
to achieve exactly nothing.

354
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:11,396
I mean, it is exactly nothing.

355
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:15,427
But, apart from that
and the weather...

356
00:17:15,505 --> 00:17:19,686
and Jeremy Clarkson,
it's all going really well.

357
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,411
As we continued north,

358
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:24,056
the misery of
the previous day was banished

359
00:17:24,115 --> 00:17:28,349
by the sheer bigness
of our surroundings.

360
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,060
Oh, this is
an astonishing place.

361
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,669
I've got a dune the size
of Mount Everest to my right,

362
00:17:37,804 --> 00:17:41,007
the Atlantic Ocean to my left...

363
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:45,216
This is absolutely epic.

364
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:55,422
This is proper
beach buggy driving.

365
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:58,891
Sun's out, sea's there
with the surf.

366
00:17:59,052 --> 00:18:01,154
It's like being
in the Beach Boys.

367
00:18:05,763 --> 00:18:07,834
Amidst all
this loveliness, though,

368
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:13,105
there was one small elephant
edging its way into the room.

369
00:18:13,755 --> 00:18:15,050
Chaps, I don't want to
have to say this,

370
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:18,974
but is the tide coming in
or going out?

371
00:18:20,174 --> 00:18:23,185
Uh... I'm guessing in.

372
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:27,950
There's no way
up the sides of that.

373
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:32,716
And if the tide comes in
that far, which it does,

374
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:34,461
we've had it.

375
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:35,990
Got to keep moving here.

376
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:38,099
We cannot afford to get stuck.

377
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:44,240
With some generous
use of the throttle,

378
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:45,786
we managed to get clear

379
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:48,575
of the sea-and-sand-dune
pincer movement.

380
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:51,786
But then we had another problem.

381
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:57,325
I'd say that was the end
of the beach.

382
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:00,005
How does that
just end like that?

383
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:01,607
- It does just end.
- That is the end.

384
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,528
And the Namibian
government doesn't allow us

385
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:06,959
to drive on the salt pans,
and that's what that is.

386
00:19:07,154 --> 00:19:08,595
This meant, according to James,

387
00:19:08,661 --> 00:19:11,964
we had only one option.

388
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:13,662
We've got to go back
the way we came.

389
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,506
But if the tide's coming in,

390
00:19:15,623 --> 00:19:18,724
that narrow bit
will have become impassable.

391
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:22,052
That's why I think if we see a
good opportunity to turn left,

392
00:19:22,218 --> 00:19:24,700
like we did last night,
we do it.

393
00:19:24,753 --> 00:19:26,721
Are you honestly suggesting
we go back in the...

394
00:19:26,802 --> 00:19:28,404
Well, where else can we go?

395
00:19:28,523 --> 00:19:30,625
We'll either drown
or starve otherwise.

396
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:37,957
Right, we've just
got to find a bit

397
00:19:38,024 --> 00:19:42,146
where we can get inland
before the tide comes in.

398
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,266
That is getting closer to that,

399
00:19:50,497 --> 00:19:52,232
and when that happens,
we've had it.

400
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,244
But as we thundered along,

401
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,997
the dunes refused
to open up and let us in.

402
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:04,784
That's the sea!

403
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,654
It's the sea, there!

404
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:11,411
Oh, it's coming at me!

405
00:20:12,818 --> 00:20:15,862
I still say
we can't get out here, look.

406
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:18,130
No left turn at the moment.

407
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:24,279
This is where you need a V8!

408
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,731
Oh, shit.

409
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:32,357
Oh, Jeremy's in trouble!

410
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:34,575
That is not looking good!

411
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:37,513
Come on, come on. Whoa.

412
00:20:39,054 --> 00:20:40,823
Oh, no.

413
00:20:43,189 --> 00:20:46,021
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Not a good place.

414
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,435
Oh, God.

415
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,630
Uh... I'm in the sea.

416
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:53,607
Because it was
a bit of an emergency,

417
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,425
my colleagues
decided to help for once.

418
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:59,338
Go.

419
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:00,661
No.

420
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,174
Is that just spinning?

421
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:03,810
It's beached under there.

422
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:05,693
I don't see why
I can't push him with that.

423
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:08,161
- All right, then. Try.
- All right.

424
00:21:08,294 --> 00:21:09,849
James, count us in.

425
00:21:09,874 --> 00:21:12,380
Three, two, one, away!

426
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:21,427
- Yes!
- Right, let's go!

427
00:21:22,844 --> 00:21:27,365
Me getting beached cost us time
we never had in the first place,

428
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,849
and we were still trapped.

429
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:34,340
Jesus Christ.

430
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,200
Ah, it's coming in.

431
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:44,036
Come on, come on, come on.

432
00:21:45,413 --> 00:21:47,044
Come on.

433
00:21:48,234 --> 00:21:49,661
Whoa!

434
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:55,958
Oh!

435
00:21:57,427 --> 00:21:59,044
Oh, that's bad.

436
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,638
Shit.

437
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:07,325
Whoa!

438
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:11,740
Come on, baby, come on.

439
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,029
Mercifully, the dunes finally
started to fall away

440
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,102
and we were saved.

441
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:25,693
- And we're through!
- We are, we are.

442
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:27,443
That's a relief.

443
00:22:29,678 --> 00:22:31,560
So nearly got stuck then.

444
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:38,318
We'd now been
on the go for 36 hours,

445
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:42,638
and we were pretty much back
where we started from... again.

446
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:46,013
We were also soaked,
frozen, worn out,

447
00:22:46,068 --> 00:22:48,083
and because
we had no food with us,

448
00:22:48,154 --> 00:22:50,138
we were also hungry.

449
00:22:50,255 --> 00:22:54,333
But then Bear Clarkson
came to the rescue.

450
00:22:54,536 --> 00:22:57,630
Cold you go and get
some driftwood for a fire?

451
00:22:57,724 --> 00:23:01,654
And could you fashion a rudimentary
barbecue grill of some sort?

452
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,161
OK. Where did you get
the fishing rod from?

453
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:06,165
It's my whip aerial.
It's a beach buggy.

454
00:23:06,232 --> 00:23:08,434
- I thought of that.
- They're fishing rods.

455
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:19,065
This is going to make a perfect
little fish grill thing, look.

456
00:23:23,922 --> 00:23:25,341
Have you got a fire lit yet?

457
00:23:25,411 --> 00:23:26,302
I thought you were fishing.

458
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:29,216
I am fishing.
My car's fishing.

459
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:31,177
- Look.
- Well, is it?

460
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:33,490
- Yeah, look, I've got the rods attached.
- It's parked.

461
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:35,497
- What's that?
- That's the grill.

462
00:23:35,607 --> 00:23:37,930
So we hold that with the
pliers from my multi-tool,

463
00:23:37,997 --> 00:23:40,083
cut the fish up, fillet it...

464
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:43,836
Can you do that? There's no point
asking him. He can open a tin...

465
00:23:43,903 --> 00:23:45,396
Can you fillet a fish?

466
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:47,661
- What, is it only fish?
- Well, it's the sea!

467
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:50,068
What did you think I was
going to catch, a chicken?

468
00:23:50,098 --> 00:23:51,443
Oh, my God!

469
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,785
- Oh, my God!
- No, wait. Yes!

470
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,833
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

471
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,229
While Hammond went off
to get more driftwood,

472
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,700
James and I set about
gutting the catch.

473
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:11,810
Use his car
as the table. There we go.

474
00:24:11,896 --> 00:24:14,529
- That's his gut. Look. You've got it.
- Yeah, right.

475
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,904
Oh, God. Shit. Look,

476
00:24:16,005 --> 00:24:18,137
it's all gone literally
onto his exhaust.

477
00:24:18,204 --> 00:24:20,310
Oh, no. Never mind.
Look, I need your help.

478
00:24:20,378 --> 00:24:21,943
Right, saw its head off.

479
00:24:23,885 --> 00:24:26,825
- Ah, there we go.
- Excellent.

480
00:24:26,971 --> 00:24:29,252
- I think, but I'm not sure...
- It's gone under his seat.

481
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:30,521
Oh, no. Has it?

482
00:24:30,621 --> 00:24:32,155
It's all right,
I'll get it out later.

483
00:24:36,357 --> 00:24:38,457
Oh, it's done a treat, this.

484
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:40,494
Look at this, Hammond.

485
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:44,396
Mm.

486
00:24:44,636 --> 00:24:46,146
Oh, that's all right, isn't it?

487
00:24:48,183 --> 00:24:49,810
Ooh.

488
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:56,897
It tastes like fish, doesn't it?

489
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,575
OK, does anybody want a beer?

490
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:02,521
- Have you got some?
- No.

491
00:25:02,654 --> 00:25:05,157
Oh, you...

492
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:07,920
That deserves a stabbing.

493
00:25:07,987 --> 00:25:09,055
That is a proper stabbing.

494
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:10,365
That's properly out of order.

495
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,294
After lunch,

496
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,845
we set off once more
into the dunes.

497
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:23,157
Right,
so let's keep heading east.

498
00:25:23,243 --> 00:25:26,025
And we must come to
a road at some...

499
00:25:26,056 --> 00:25:28,743
There has to be a road.

500
00:25:28,975 --> 00:25:31,993
But, for mile after mile,

501
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:33,407
there wasn't.

502
00:25:44,923 --> 00:25:46,325
It's the Namib Desert.

503
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:51,263
"Namib" in the local dialect
means "big nothing".

504
00:25:56,532 --> 00:26:00,275
It must be the prettiest
desert in the world.

505
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:02,525
It's just a sea of dunes.

506
00:26:07,723 --> 00:26:11,247
Dunes which were getting bigger.

507
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:14,253
Bloody Nora,
look at the size of that!

508
00:26:16,222 --> 00:26:20,598
Engaging 180 horsepower.

509
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:23,622
Climbing them in our
two-wheel-drive beach buggies

510
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:25,282
was becoming tricky.

511
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:32,471
Come on, you can do this.
You can do this!

512
00:26:32,496 --> 00:26:37,169
But by deploying the V8,
I was sort of all right.

513
00:26:37,286 --> 00:26:38,614
Yes!

514
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:41,647
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

515
00:26:41,856 --> 00:26:45,809
Hammond had grippy tyres,
so he was all right, too.

516
00:26:45,997 --> 00:26:48,520
Please, make it. Please.

517
00:26:49,893 --> 00:26:51,127
Please!

518
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,583
Ho-ho!

519
00:26:54,755 --> 00:26:56,153
There you go!

520
00:26:56,295 --> 00:26:59,559
However, back in the 1960s...

521
00:27:01,963 --> 00:27:04,199
Come on, little car.

522
00:27:05,215 --> 00:27:06,458
Oh, no, no, no.

523
00:27:06,552 --> 00:27:08,036
No, no.

524
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,567
- Stuck?
- Yes.

525
00:27:20,676 --> 00:27:22,840
Two problems. Number one,

526
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,934
he's put a 90 horsepower
engine in it,

527
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:27,005
which actually
is probably only 40.

528
00:27:27,122 --> 00:27:28,278
- Yeah.
- And number two,

529
00:27:28,364 --> 00:27:30,997
he will not use full power ever.

530
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:34,661
Well, he's got a 90 horsepower
engine, but a 5 horsepower foot.

531
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:39,598
And I bet you any money he's
saying "I had a misfire."

532
00:27:47,348 --> 00:27:49,622
You've got to push the
accelerator all the way to...

533
00:27:49,661 --> 00:27:51,153
I know, but... I know that.

534
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:52,871
It occasionally has
a little misfire moment,

535
00:27:52,895 --> 00:27:54,278
and then I lose it.

536
00:27:54,526 --> 00:27:56,294
He said it!

537
00:27:58,061 --> 00:28:00,708
And so the afternoon continued.

538
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:04,830
The Grunt Machine and the Grit
Machine would forge ahead...

539
00:28:05,012 --> 00:28:08,458
There is no way in hell
I'm doing this!

540
00:28:08,758 --> 00:28:10,394
Yes!

541
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,786
You star!

542
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:17,075
And then there'd be

543
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:19,656
the inevitable radio exchange.

544
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,419
We appear to be a man down,
Jeremy.

545
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,683
James May, where are you?

546
00:28:29,786 --> 00:28:31,669
Because we spent so much time

547
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:34,278
waiting for Captain Misfire,

548
00:28:34,393 --> 00:28:37,496
we were still in the desert
as dusk fell.

549
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:41,600
And failing light meant it
was hard to spot obstacles.

550
00:28:42,951 --> 00:28:44,652
Right, sit rep.

551
00:28:44,883 --> 00:28:48,137
Jesus Christ!

552
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,309
Holy...

553
00:28:54,278 --> 00:28:56,106
Oh, my God!

554
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,981
Oh, shit!

555
00:28:59,192 --> 00:29:00,719
Look at it!

556
00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:03,223
Mate, I've got to have a look.

557
00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:08,614
Oh, shitty death...

558
00:29:10,396 --> 00:29:13,299
- I locked up. That was just...
- Look, he's buried!

559
00:29:13,365 --> 00:29:16,968
- You've buried the front.
- I was completely locked up.

560
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:18,979
'Cause I would have
gone down that.

561
00:29:19,065 --> 00:29:20,567
Look at it!

562
00:29:22,611 --> 00:29:25,573
My close shave was a reminder
that, after dark,

563
00:29:25,656 --> 00:29:29,393
these dunes would become
very, very dangerous.

564
00:29:34,893 --> 00:29:37,722
It's getting harder and harder
to read the terrain now.

565
00:29:37,862 --> 00:29:39,495
Is that a drop?
Is that a hill?

566
00:29:39,535 --> 00:29:42,026
Is that going up? Is that a cliff?
What is it?

567
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:46,753
Peril... peril.

568
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:49,323
Oh, shit!

569
00:29:49,432 --> 00:29:51,370
Oh, I think there's
a drop off there.

570
00:29:52,175 --> 00:29:54,126
It's just a black abyss.

571
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:58,016
That could be
a huge cliff again.

572
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,766
Eventually,
we could take no more,

573
00:30:02,804 --> 00:30:07,751
and we had to settle down for a
second night around our engines.

574
00:30:31,188 --> 00:30:34,164
We will find a road.
There must...

575
00:30:34,189 --> 00:30:36,443
- It can't... It can't go on forever, can it?
- No.

576
00:30:36,498 --> 00:30:40,779
It has to... There will be
a town, a road... something.

577
00:30:43,222 --> 00:30:46,285
Unfortunately,
to find salvation,

578
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:50,308
we still had to climb
more dunes.

579
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:54,233
Climb them and then
get down the other side.

580
00:30:54,581 --> 00:30:56,082
Oh, my God!

581
00:30:57,771 --> 00:30:59,519
Well, that's just a cliff!

582
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:03,538
Whoa! Aargh!

583
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:13,385
Whoa, this is a monster.

584
00:31:13,452 --> 00:31:16,816
Oh!
I don't think I can do...!

585
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:19,627
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

586
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:28,367
Whoa-a-a-a-a-a!

587
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:32,824
Here we go.

588
00:31:33,113 --> 00:31:35,754
All three of us
simultaneously...

589
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,336
Holy shit.

590
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:42,832
Oh-h-h-h, shit!

591
00:31:43,204 --> 00:31:46,058
Argh-hhh! Ha-ha!

592
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:49,007
Whoa-a-a-a-a!

593
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,840
I wasn't scared.

594
00:31:57,062 --> 00:31:58,629
Oh, my God.

595
00:31:58,808 --> 00:32:02,316
Guys, this is the biggest yet
by a country mile.

596
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:07,108
Whoa-a-a-a-a-a!

597
00:32:07,715 --> 00:32:08,835
Is that the size of the drop

598
00:32:08,877 --> 00:32:10,918
or what's happened to his penis?

599
00:32:13,494 --> 00:32:16,191
Right, then. Let's see
what all the fuss is about.

600
00:32:16,447 --> 00:32:18,416
Holy shit!

601
00:32:21,344 --> 00:32:26,283
Oh-h-h-h-h!

602
00:32:29,207 --> 00:32:30,426
Phwoar.

603
00:32:30,487 --> 00:32:32,189
And now straighten
those wheels, Richard,

604
00:32:32,237 --> 00:32:33,456
straighten them,

605
00:32:33,544 --> 00:32:35,113
because you've got to
go down straight.

606
00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:39,250
Holy shit.
Oh-h-h-h-h, shit!

607
00:32:39,614 --> 00:32:41,416
That is frightening.

608
00:32:47,046 --> 00:32:48,777
Love this desert.

609
00:32:49,113 --> 00:32:51,182
I'm never, ever, ever happier

610
00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:53,558
than I am when I'm in a desert.

611
00:32:53,824 --> 00:32:57,889
And this... this is the best
desert I've ever been to.

612
00:33:00,449 --> 00:33:02,628
You can never really lose
sight of the fact, though,

613
00:33:02,694 --> 00:33:04,330
that what it actually is

614
00:33:04,488 --> 00:33:08,134
is a big, orange killing engine.

615
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:12,063
Now, a big crest's coming up.
No idea.

616
00:33:12,422 --> 00:33:15,618
Gentle rolling hill
or massive cliff?

617
00:33:15,755 --> 00:33:17,759
I don't know, Hammond!

618
00:33:17,905 --> 00:33:20,107
Hammond, seriously.

619
00:33:20,243 --> 00:33:22,010
Shit, he's gone.

620
00:33:22,337 --> 00:33:25,392
Hammond's gone, everyone.
Hammond's gone. Big one.

621
00:33:28,693 --> 00:33:30,392
Oh, me.

622
00:33:37,235 --> 00:33:41,321
How the did you get down that?

623
00:33:41,868 --> 00:33:44,079
With my eyes shut!

624
00:33:44,285 --> 00:33:46,938
That was terrifying!

625
00:33:49,337 --> 00:33:51,657
Jesus!

626
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:01,271
As we continued to head east,

627
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:03,601
the terrain
eventually levelled out...

628
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:12,329
which meant we swapped terror
for extreme discomfort.

629
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:17,904
Ah. Oh, God Almighty.

630
00:34:18,251 --> 00:34:21,048
I don't think these cars
were actually designed

631
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:23,579
to take this much punishment.

632
00:34:23,696 --> 00:34:26,313
And I know we weren't.

633
00:34:26,657 --> 00:34:28,154
The only thing is,

634
00:34:28,204 --> 00:34:31,751
James's car rides lower
than this and will be worse.

635
00:34:31,993 --> 00:34:34,886
Argh! Ow!

636
00:34:34,953 --> 00:34:36,688
Ow! Ow! Ow!

637
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:40,592
Agh!

638
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:42,658
Soon, the relentless battering

639
00:34:42,737 --> 00:34:45,407
started to cause breakdowns.

640
00:34:46,863 --> 00:34:49,966
Sand... Sand in gear shift.

641
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:53,390
My throttle is
jammed wide open, people.

642
00:35:03,632 --> 00:35:06,679
The problem is that every
time the air filter, here,

643
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:09,320
turns as I'm driving along...
Which it does...

644
00:35:09,446 --> 00:35:11,843
It's jamming the throttle.

645
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:16,538
What's going on here?

646
00:35:17,891 --> 00:35:19,192
What's up?

647
00:35:19,398 --> 00:35:21,054
The throttle is now jamming

648
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:22,796
fully open all the time.

649
00:35:22,885 --> 00:35:24,906
Oh, problem.

650
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:43,906
Oh, God.

651
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:49,291
It is still moving.

652
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,393
Many miles ahead,

653
00:35:51,624 --> 00:35:54,968
we'd pulled over for a break
from the endless bumps,

654
00:35:55,085 --> 00:35:58,210
and James was being
very interesting!

655
00:36:01,507 --> 00:36:04,226
The good thing about this hat is you
can angle it, like a heliostat,

656
00:36:04,273 --> 00:36:05,726
to where the sun's coming from.

657
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,390
Yes, that's true.

658
00:36:07,562 --> 00:36:09,578
But you still look a tit.

659
00:36:10,147 --> 00:36:12,918
Luckily for Hammond, who
could do with the company,

660
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,786
I was back on the move.

661
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:20,200
Right, a new style of driving
is now required.

662
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:24,020
This arm for steering,
this arm for changing gear,

663
00:36:24,129 --> 00:36:29,137
and then another arm
for deaccelerating, like so.

664
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:31,137
Yes!

665
00:36:31,236 --> 00:36:32,871
Accelerate.

666
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:36,543
Deaccelerate.

667
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:39,277
Sometimes, if you
listen very carefully,

668
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:41,317
you can hear my genius.

669
00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:45,395
Back as a threesome,
we continued

670
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:49,489
with our seemingly
endless journey to the east.

671
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:53,262
Just need to find a road now.
This is not funny any more.

672
00:36:53,364 --> 00:36:55,371
Enough desert.

673
00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:57,292
I don't want another night
in the desert.

674
00:36:59,137 --> 00:37:02,403
I smell pretty bad.

675
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:03,752
And I suspect that if we manage

676
00:37:03,817 --> 00:37:06,786
to find somewhere tonight
near civilisation,

677
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:08,582
we should probably
have a ceremonial

678
00:37:08,607 --> 00:37:11,051
bonfire of the underpants.

679
00:37:11,528 --> 00:37:12,548
In truth, though,

680
00:37:12,573 --> 00:37:15,809
I thought we'd be
in the desert forever.

681
00:37:16,142 --> 00:37:19,895
But then,
late in the afternoon...

682
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:26,063
I'm looking ahead, and I'm not
seeing an endless sea of sand.

683
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:29,026
I'm seeing green.

684
00:37:30,404 --> 00:37:33,174
Trees!
Those are trees and shrubs!

685
00:37:37,891 --> 00:37:39,106
Pylons!

686
00:37:39,231 --> 00:37:41,903
Pylons!
That means electricity.

687
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:47,262
Oh, yes!

688
00:37:48,234 --> 00:37:50,020
Civilisation!

689
00:37:51,678 --> 00:37:54,575
And then, best of all...

690
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,395
Oh, my God.

691
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:08,723
I honestly thought we had
another night of sleeping...

692
00:38:08,762 --> 00:38:09,807
in the sand.

693
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:12,911
But, no! Look at it!

694
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:16,012
Nicest thing I've ever seen.

695
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,754
I could go east,
I could go west...

696
00:38:21,826 --> 00:38:24,309
Whichever way you go, it goes
somewhere. That's the point.

697
00:38:24,395 --> 00:38:26,426
It's a road, it goes somewhere.

698
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,386
You know what we've
just done, don't you?

699
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:33,160
We've just crossed the Namib
Desert in three beach buggies.

700
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,383
- We have.
- We did.

701
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,817
We did.

702
00:38:36,496 --> 00:38:39,328
There is literally nothing
can stop us now.

703
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:44,697
Admittedly,

704
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:48,085
our crossing had not exactly
been as the crow flies,

705
00:38:48,217 --> 00:38:50,361
but we had found our road,

706
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:52,893
and that's all that mattered.

707
00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:54,898
Oh, yes!

708
00:38:54,978 --> 00:38:57,182
That's the best thing
I've ever seen!

709
00:38:57,299 --> 00:39:00,760
Yes, it is the road to freedom!

710
00:39:01,411 --> 00:39:03,780
What the hell was that?

711
00:39:05,797 --> 00:39:09,563
Something has just exploded
at the back of my car.

712
00:39:09,691 --> 00:39:11,893
Oh, dear.

713
00:39:11,992 --> 00:39:14,367
By the time my colleagues
had got back to me,

714
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:17,300
I'd worked out
what the problem was.

715
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:19,577
It's really straightforward, OK?

716
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:22,875
- The top bolt has come out of the shock absorber.
- Right.

717
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:26,664
It shot up, boinged
into the coolant pipe,

718
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:29,906
and three gallons of water
have simply burst out,

719
00:39:29,949 --> 00:39:32,945
going everywhere
except into the engine.

720
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:36,445
- Right.
- So all I've got to do is reattach the top bolt...

721
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:40,820
mend the pipe and find
three gallons of water...

722
00:39:41,102 --> 00:39:45,640
which I shall get from a passing
motorist, and I'll be on my way.

723
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:47,429
- Right.
- All I could do with a hand with

724
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:48,492
is just lifting the car up

725
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:51,600
so I can reattach the, um...

726
00:39:51,678 --> 00:39:54,124
Yeah. Well,
is there anybody here?

727
00:39:54,287 --> 00:39:55,625
- There's...
- I suppose a motorist will pass eventually.

728
00:39:55,649 --> 00:39:59,007
The one that gives you water
will also lift it up for you.

729
00:39:59,075 --> 00:40:00,905
You could just
lift it up a little bit.

730
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:02,843
Or we could go and have a beer.

731
00:40:02,904 --> 00:40:05,053
- I hear traffic. - Yes.
- We'd better not be here.

732
00:40:05,078 --> 00:40:06,639
We don't want to interfere
when you're trying to talk

733
00:40:06,663 --> 00:40:08,546
'cause we might put them off.

734
00:40:13,515 --> 00:40:14,989
Right.

735
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:29,982
Somewhere along here
there will be a place,

736
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:33,028
and that place
will have a bar in it

737
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:34,888
that will contain beer.

738
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,200
Do you have any water?

739
00:40:41,466 --> 00:40:42,482
- Huh?
- Water.

740
00:40:42,536 --> 00:40:44,544
Because the radiator has blown,

741
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:46,310
so I need just three gallons.

742
00:40:46,427 --> 00:40:49,825
Look, you've got some water
there. Just a bucket.

743
00:40:53,011 --> 00:40:55,881
It's an actual water lorry...

744
00:40:56,065 --> 00:40:59,153
leaking water,
and he won't give me any.

745
00:41:03,331 --> 00:41:05,513
Eventually,
I flagged down a local

746
00:41:05,587 --> 00:41:07,677
who had water to spare.

747
00:41:07,778 --> 00:41:09,638
Thank you.

748
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,646
And then I got on
with the repairs.

749
00:41:13,075 --> 00:41:16,911
That is one reassembled
shock absorber.

750
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:18,568
That's reattached,

751
00:41:18,607 --> 00:41:21,482
so that's the cooling system
back in one piece.

752
00:41:25,423 --> 00:41:28,888
After an exhausting
five-hour drive,

753
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:31,677
Richard and I finally
reached a town,

754
00:41:31,786 --> 00:41:36,139
which turned out to be Windhoek,

755
00:41:36,435 --> 00:41:39,575
and we too were
taking on liquids.

756
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,873
Mm.

757
00:42:04,433 --> 00:42:06,372
Back out on the highway, though,

758
00:42:06,509 --> 00:42:08,997
things weren't so good.

759
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:14,021
What I'm driving here - or
attempting to drive - is Apollo 13.

760
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:15,744
There's some air
trapped in the system

761
00:42:15,811 --> 00:42:18,982
and I've had to make
a small hole in the front

762
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:20,443
to get at the radiator.

763
00:42:20,515 --> 00:42:21,536
Bled that,

764
00:42:21,602 --> 00:42:23,388
bled all the stuff
going into the engine.

765
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:24,542
This is the header pipe.

766
00:42:24,604 --> 00:42:26,305
Everything is bled, and yet,

767
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:28,838
you do a mile, it overheats.

768
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,044
Another mile, overheats.

769
00:42:42,438 --> 00:42:47,005
Well, we've covered...
20 miles in four hours.

770
00:43:01,693 --> 00:43:06,762
This is the sixth time
in 30 miles that's happened.

771
00:43:06,966 --> 00:43:09,765
Whilst my colleagues
embraced beer and bed,

772
00:43:09,832 --> 00:43:13,502
I steeled myself
for the longest, coldest,

773
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:17,440
most frustrating night
of my life.

774
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,669
The roads are getting worse.

775
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:27,232
Honestly, my bones
are going to shatter.

776
00:43:27,911 --> 00:43:29,958
Oh, my God!

777
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:39,419
- I've had a great idea.
- Oh, no.

778
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:42,169
Oh, shit, it's really high!
