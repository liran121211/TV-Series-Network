Every single one of my family
back to the 17th century's

00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:53,874
Ooh, and then there was
a TV show called
Last Of The Summer Wine,

50
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:57,911
which was about three
very badly dressed old men

51
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,513
who fell over,

52
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,615

they ever did went wrong.

of the British Isles.

-No, it's not.

But there is a lot
of motoring-related stuff
here this week,

61
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,098
because we're in town.

63
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,836
So, let's get on
with the show.

64
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,372
Yes, let's.

65
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:28,509
We begin in Victorian times,

66
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:30,978
when James May
was a little old lady.

67
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,179

68
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,749
You see, back then,

00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,586
-Rich people in tweed suits.
-Yes, rich people
in tweed suits

70
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,889
would take what was
known as the Grand Tour.

71
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,891
They'd go off
to France or Italy,

72
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,060
and they'd spend a few months
learning about culture

73
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,729
and wine and music.

74
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:51,299
Nowadays, of course,
everybody goes to Magaluf

75
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,967
and learns about beer
and vomit and chlamydia.

76
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,303
-(LAUGHTER)
JAMES: Yeah.

77
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:57,738
Now, we think
this is a real shame,

78
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,607
so Jeremy and I went off
to Italy

79
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:03,311
to do our own modern take
on the Grand Tour.

80
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:05,546
A wonderful,
inspirational journey

81
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,915
that not only gave its name
to this show,

82
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,018
but also to 1,000 GT cars:

83
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,520
grand tourers.

84
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:21,862
JEREMY: Our start point
was the Tuscan hilltop city
of Siena.

85
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:29,136
Home to the most exciting
horse race in the world:

86
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,038
the Palio.

Look at that! Wow!

90
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:47,555
It was the beginning of
what would be a very fabulous

91
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,457
and very cultured journey.

92
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,462
We'd visit the magnificent
cities of Florence

93
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,163
and Bologna and Verona

94
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,131
on our way
to the finishing point

95
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:01,735
in the most magnificent city
of them all:

96
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,003
Venice.

97
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,873
The cars we'd be driving
were fabulous, too.

98
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,777
James had chosen
the Rolls-Royce Dawn,

99
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:13,547
a new two-door, drop-head
version of the Ghost.

100
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:17,385
And I'd be in the DB11,

101
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,086
the latest in a long line

102
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:23,457
of elegant and beautiful
Aston Martin grand tourers.

103
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,561
Even its door mirrors
are beautiful.

104
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,463
Its wheels are beautiful.

105
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,898
This is...

106
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:34,402
This is one of the most
beautiful cars I've ever seen.

107
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:35,703
JAMES: Shame it's brown.

108
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,406
-It isn't brown!
-Yes, it is.

109
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,641
It isn't brown!
It's Sunset Orange.

110
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,411
It's not brown in the way
that my car is green.

111
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:44,745
It's brown.

112
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,481
Your car is a convertible
BMW 7 Series.

113
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:48,682
JAMES: No, it isn't.

114
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,651
JEREMY: But is it
a 7 Series underneath?

115
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:52,620
-Bits of the floor panel.
-There you go.

116
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,789
£265,000
for a convertible 7 Series.

117
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:56,924
It isn't!

118

across Italy,

-...that's what you need.

121

-A brown car?
-It isn't brown!

122
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:07,668
-It's brown!
-Look, let's not bicker.

00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:11,271
Actually, on this occasion,
let's get on.

124
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,773
We are both
going to drive across

125
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,809
what is, I think, our
favourite country
in the world,

126
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,646
enjoy some culture,
enjoy some fine wine,

127
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,347

you were coming.

We rather hoped you weren't.

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,162
Well, I am, and look at
the car I've brought.

134
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,599
Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat.

135
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,801
707 American horsepower,

136
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,671
and enough torque to pull
that old building down.

137
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,006
JAMES: Just...
That "old building" is a...

138
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,274
Oh, well, never mind.

139
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,811
Hammond, Tuscany, not really
the home of the muscle car.

140
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:55,483
Yeah, you see, I was worried
you two were gonna be all
boring and serious.

141
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,851
And I am here to make sure
this trip is fun

142
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,920
because don't tell me
the original Grand Tour
wasn't fun.

143
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,756
It was like an 18th century
Cannonball Run,

144
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:05,192
only with old-fashioned
morphine instead of cocaine.

145
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,627
This is gonna be brilliant.

146
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:08,061
What's with your advertising?

147
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,564
Well, because the Americans
used to do the Grand Tour,

148
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,566
and they used to get sponsors
to help cover the costs,

149
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,034
so I've got myself
some sponsorship.

150

What is a grit?

Yep, look at that.

156

The things is, people will
look at me in that

I am on a Grand Tour.

-You have made no effort.

in a car with that much power
and that much torque,

Ha-ha!

175
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:33,213
Hammond, you're deliberately
making an irritating noise.

176
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,447
Please stop it.

177
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,083
(GIGGLES) I am, yeah.

178
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:45,192
I will freely admit that
Hammond's Dodge Hellcat
is a remarkable car.

179
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:52,299
It would be perfect
if we were at a tractor pull
in Milwaukee.

180
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,335
But we're not. We're here.

181
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,204
And here in Tuscany...

182
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,840
...you need one of these.

183
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,057
This is the all-new
replacement for the DB9,

184
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:20,728
and it is the perfect car
for the job.

185
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,497
It even comes with
three running modes.

186
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:27,300
You've got Sport, Sport Plus,

187
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,102
and the one I'm gonna use.

188
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,139
GT.

189

Grand Touring.

190
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:40,648
Up front, there's a 5.2
litre, twin-turbocharged V12

191
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:44,051
which produces
600 horsepower.

192
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,654
And they are smooth
horsepower.

193
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,155
(ENGINE REVS)

194
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,658
Dreamy horsepower.

195
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:58,198
In the fullness of time,
you'll be able to buy
a cheaper version of this car

196
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,101
with an AMG V8.

197
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:04,037
It's all part of a deal
that Aston have done
with Mercedes,

198
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,139
and you can see evidence
of the deal already.

199
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,876
This has got
Mercedes switchgear,
Mercedes electronics.

200
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,111
It's even got
Mercedes sat-nav.

201
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,948
And I've got to say...

202
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,349
Aston Martin and Mercedes,

203
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,987
that is the best
Anglo-German marriage

204
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,790
since Queen Victoria
married Albert.

205
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,526
James, though, disagreed.

206
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,830
Actually, this is the best
Anglo-German marriage.

207
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,170
It's perfect, in fact,
because it has all the things

208
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:40,207
that we like to think of as
being Britishness in a car.

209
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,910
The sense that it was made
by men in aprons,

210
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,546
that there are craft skills
and traditional materials
involved.

211
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:49,116
But then you've got
the Germans there,
with their hi-tech

212
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,752
and their
manufacturing efficiency.

213

I could quote on this car.

You know, the usual:
top speed, power, 0-60.

irrelevant rubbish.

from the 6.2 litre V8 HEMI.

225
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:37,330
And over the top,
that shrill, manic whine
of the supercharger.

226

Neither is it a particularly
economical one.

it'll chew through
its 18.5-gallon fuel tank

in just 13 minutes.

229
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:53,814
And, in fact, it needs
so much air to mix with all
that petrol it's drinking,

230
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:56,083
they had to remove
one of the headlights

231
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,351
and replace it
with a ram-air intake

232
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,320
to feed air to the engine.

233

So they swapped its eye
for a nostril.

234

The upside of all this,
however,

235
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,333
is that it's extremely fast.

236
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,170
It'll do the standing quarter
faster than
a Porsche 911 GT3,

341
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,563
James Bond simply threw him
through a window,

342
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,732
and that's
what I'm gonna do to him.

343

-Do you mind
if I don't take part in this?
-(LAUGHS)

344
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,470
I'll do it.

345
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,377
JEREMY: So, as Hammond
had some new tyres fitted...

346
00:17:57,444 --> 00:18:01,581
again, I took to the track
for some sighting laps.

347
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,621
Now, let's get one thing
straight from the start.

348
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:14,694
Aston Martins are not really
designed to do track work.

349
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,830
They're designed
to look good, and that's it.

350
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,369
Yes, the chassis on this,
the DB11,

351
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,071
was developed
by a former Lotus engineer,

352
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:26,506
but they actually told him

353
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:29,842
to tune it more for comfort
than handling.

354
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:33,546
That being said,

355
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:38,718
this has an aluminium chassis
and some aero trickery.

356
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,390
Air is sucked into holes
behind the rear windows

357
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:48,195
and then shot out of a vent
on the boot lid,

358
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:50,230
giving me
a sort of air rear wing.

359
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:55,735
Giving me grip...
a lot of grip.

360
00:18:56,903 --> 00:19:00,440
And the traction control
is simply astonishing.

361
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:03,876
In most cars, it's like
somebody hitting you
on the head with a hammer,

362
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,345
but in this, it's just going,

363
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:08,648
"Erm... Hang on, hang on,
hang on." There you go.

364
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,286
Bloody hellfire!
This is very, very good.

365
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:20,227
Certainly it's good enough
to be able to totally destroy

366
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,429
Hammond's idiotic Dodge.

367
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,468
This does not have
a magnesium roof,

368
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,603
carbon-fibre prop shaft.

369
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,072
The engine isn't made
from aluminium,
it's made from cast iron.

370
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:36,243
And you get the impression
they'd have made it
from stone if they could.

371
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:41,548
What it does have
is vast reserves of power,

372
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,116
and even vaster reserves
of character.

373
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:45,752
This thing is just hilarious.

374
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:52,425

375
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:55,528
Look at him
in his little brown Aston,

376
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:58,331
being all in control, and
just not having fun, is he?

377
00:19:58,398 --> 00:19:59,832
I mean, what's the point?

378
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,504
JEREMY: Showboating.
Probably thinks I can't.

379
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:07,640

this is a 600 horsepower,

381
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,280
So I turned
the traction control off,

382
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,382
and all hell broke loose.

of the original Grand Tour

388

wasn't just to look at things
and learn about things.

389
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,479
It was also to enhance

510
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:12,699
Yes, because unlike
other gemstones, it's coal.

511
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:14,533
-Yeah, but...
-(LAUGHTER)

512
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,102
-But it's...
-It's coal, isn't it?

513
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,905
Unlike other gemstones,
Hammond, it's a lot cheaper.

514
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,140
-Well, yes, it would be.
-(LAUGHTER)

515
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:24,210
Well, seriously, you
can get a jet ring, look,
for 32 quid.

516
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:26,612
You get a sack of it
for ten quid. It's coal!

517
00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:27,980
-(LAUGHTER)
-Thing is, though...

518
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:29,381
We were thinking
the other day,

519
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:32,819
you know carmakers now they
use bamboo, ash, walnut

520
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:34,987
and carbon fibre
to decorate bits of a car?

521
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:37,323
-Why don't they use jet?
-Exactly.

522
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,726
Anybody would like to have
some jet in their car.

523
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:42,228
Actually, we've been
doing a little bit of
experimenting, Hammond.

524
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:46,733
I've made a prototype.
This is a gearstick
with a jet knob...

525
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:47,834
(LAUGHTER)

526
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,401
...on the top.
It's brilliant.

527
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:52,071
I mean, it's not polished
yet, but you change gear.

528
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:54,273
It does make your hand
a bit dirty.

529
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,608
But, no, that's
a handy reminder. It is.

530
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:58,745
Exactly. No, you're
absolutely right
'cause you know,

531
00:27:58,745 --> 00:28:00,379
sometimes you drive
an unfamiliar car,
you're on the motorway

532
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,782
and you think,
"Oh, did I change into sixth?

533
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:05,384
-Yeah, I did."
-(LAUGHTER)

534
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:08,354
Here's some conversation...
for Conversation Street.

535
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,423
Erm... Bad news.
There is a problem right now
in this country.

536
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,961
Not enough people
are learning to drive.
Seriously.

537
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:19,999
In 2007, just over 16,000
driving tests were conducted.

538
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:23,602
Last year,
that had dropped to 4,650.

539
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:27,774
That is a true fact.
In less than ten years,
16,000 down to 4,000.

540
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:28,941
And I know why.

541
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:30,442
It's because kids
leave school these days,

542
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:33,079
they've no idea who Hitler
was, they can't add up.

543
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:34,781
They just know cars are bad.

544
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:37,850
That's all they learn:
cars are bad, cars are bad,
cars are bad.

545
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:39,819
Then, when they do
get out of school,
after what--

546
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:41,220
after school's finished,

547
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:44,290
they go around and see
speed cameras, traffic jams,

548
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:47,493
signs saying "Please don't
overtake cyclists" and think,
"What's the point?"

549
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,262
"No point learning to drive.
I might as well just use Uber."

550
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:51,964
Exactly.
If I were a carmaker,

551
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:54,801
I would be fighting
like a Kilkenny cat

552
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,069
to make sure every car I made

553
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:59,205
was as interesting
and as amazing as possible.

554
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:02,041
But instead... Renault,
they give us the KADJAR.

555
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:03,810
-(LAUGHTER)
-How many children...

556
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,946
How many children will say,
"If I work really hard
and do my homework,

557
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:09,515
one day, maybe,
I can have a KADJAR"?

558
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,918
RICHARD: Cos that's the car
they grow up seeing.

559
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:13,252
Worse still, Nissan Juke.

560
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:16,155
-You really hate the Juke.
-No, I hate it.

561
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:18,057
-No, he genuinely hates...
-No, I hate...

562
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:21,894
I object to it existing.
It shouldn't exist.
I loathe it.

563
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,330
On the motorway, you
see them with their stupid,

564
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:26,432
like, double bug eyes.

565
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:27,733
Smug little...

566
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,969
If I see one, I'm mad.
I can't help myself.

567
00:29:30,036 --> 00:29:31,838
And it's cruel, and I'm
sorry if you're in one.

568
00:29:31,838 --> 00:29:32,905
But I do, I see them.

569
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:33,973
(WHISPERS) "I hate..."

570
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,842
-(MOUTHING)
-(LAUGHTER)

571
00:29:35,842 --> 00:29:39,011
JEREMY: He does.
I was driving along with him
the other day...

572
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:40,880
I was busy
telling him a story,

573
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:41,881
and he was looking out
the window going,

574
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:43,615
"I hate you! I hate you!"

575
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,017
I hate them.

576
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:46,853
What's the most boring car
on sale in Britain today?

577
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:48,054
That's a good question.

578
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,422
-(AUDIENCE CALLING OUT)
MAN: Brown Astons!

579
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:51,958
(LAUGHTER)

580
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:54,626
RICHARD: Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!
-Who said that?

581
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:56,295
(APPLAUSE)

582
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:58,197
Get out. Get out.

583
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,572
Security, kill him.

584
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,007
(LAUGHTER)

585
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:10,142
"Brown Astons" my...

586
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:12,244
I tell you what, if I were
the boss of Volkswagen,

587
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,812
I'd go and find the
man who did...

588
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,647
What's that tall Golf called?

589
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,383
Oh, the SV.

590
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,886
SV, that's it.
The one that's like a Golf,

591
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:22,288
but for people who have
stovepipe hats.

592
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:25,324
And I would bludgeon him
with a tyre iron.

593
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:28,260
"Why did you do that?
Nobody wants one!"

594
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,964
Just to be fair, I think VW
have bigger concerns
at the moment.

595
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:34,300
OK, I want to talk about
the Oxford Ring Road.

596
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:37,136
I know it's miles away
from here and from
anybody watching,

597
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:40,172
but the thing is, OK,
for the last two years,

598
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:43,042
they've been
working on shrinking -
slightly shrinking -

599
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:45,211
two roundabouts and putting
some traffic lights up.

600
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:48,915
Now, do you know how much
the budget was for that job?

601
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:52,051
Er... Two roundabouts,
ten grand a roundabout.
I'd say 20 grand overall.

602
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:54,686
£9 million.

603
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:57,023
-Million? Nine million?
-Nine million.

604
00:30:57,089 --> 00:31:00,626
Can you imagine
the builder's face when
he came out of that meeting?

605
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:04,931
"They're gonna give me
nine million quid

606
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:07,066
to shrink a couple
of roundabouts!"

607
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:08,500
Well, that's why it's
taken him two years.

608
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:11,137
He had to make it look like
nine million quid's worth.

609
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,471
"Really difficult."

610
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:13,705
This is not a word of a lie.

611
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:18,377
£9 million will buy you
a 30,000-square-foot house,

612
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:19,478
OK, like this.

613
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:22,248
That is a nine-million-quid
house to build.

614
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:25,651
You can have that
or two shaved roundabouts...
for your nine million quid.

615
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,286
No. No, actually. No.

616
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:30,022
Because - and this, again,
is not a word of a lie -

617
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:32,124
a few months ago,
builder man -

618
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:34,093
and it must have been a bet -

619
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,963
he went back to the council
and he said,

620
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:38,230
"I need another
million quid."

621
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:39,698
-(LAUGHTER)
-And they paid?

622
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:42,534
And they paid! They paid!

623
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:45,337
He probably shuffled in.
"I broke me spade."

624
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,472
(LAUGHTER)

625
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:49,308
"Another million?"
"Yes, of course. Happy to."

626
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,477
Can I be cross for a moment
with BMW?

627
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,279
It'll be difficult
to stop you. Yes.

628
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:56,082
The thing was, last year
they introduced this.

629
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,649
They showed...
They went, "Look at that."

630
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,585
And everybody went,
"That is fantastic!"

631
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,990
It's an homage to the old
CSL Batmobile from '72.

632
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,657
Everyone was going,
"When will you make it?"

633
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:08,160
"We're not. It's just to show
you what we could make."

634
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:09,561
RICHARD:
Why did they show us?

635
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:11,097
JEREMY: Just don't do that!
-Yeah, exactly.

636
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:12,631
Actually, no,
it doesn't matter,

637
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:14,233
because they've come up
with something else instead.

638
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,502
This look.
This is actually an homage

639
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:19,371
to the original 2002, which is
the old car on the left,

640
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,441
and that, I think,
actually looks pretty fab.

641
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:24,410
-It does. Are they
gonna make it?
-No.

642
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:26,178
Well, why show it to us,
then?

643
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:28,014
"Look what we could make
but we're not."

644
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,749
It's a good job BMW don't
run the emergency services,
isn't it?

645
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:34,520
"Oh, look! You have drifted
a long way from shore there,
haven't you?

646
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:36,788
We could drag you back
behind our speedboat."

647
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:40,459
"Will you?"
"No. No, we just wanted you
to know that we could."

648
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:42,894
What they're being
is prick-teasers.

649
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:45,031
-Oh, you can't say that.
-(LAUGHTER)

650
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:46,498
I don't think
you can say that.

651
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:48,267
I'm not sure
you can say that.

652
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,036
Can you say "prick-tease"?

653
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:51,737
MAN: A cock-tease!
-Is it allowed today?

654
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,673
"Cock-tease"?
That's no different.
You've just changed the name!

655
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,176
It's a different way
of saying "prick" or "dick".

656
00:32:57,243 --> 00:32:59,545
You could have said "penis
tease". It doesn't matter!

657
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:02,048
Conversation Street's
taken a really bad turn.

658
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:03,382
(LAUGHTER)

659
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:06,918
The point I'm trying to make
is BMW must stop doing that.

660
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:08,054
(LAUGHTER)

661
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:09,621
Whatever... Whatever it was.

662
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:12,891
Now, if we had
a Grand Tour medal,

663
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,493
and we don't, but if we did,

664
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,196
I know who the first
recipient would be.

665
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:19,365
Cos we heard this amazing
story the other day.

666
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:20,766
You know speed camera vans?

667
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,169
Sit at the side of the road,
blacked out windows,

668
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:26,438
civil servant sitting inside
watching YouPorn. OK?

669
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,775
That's what it is.
Waiting for someone
to trip his camera.

670
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,077
Now, someone, the other day,

671
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:34,946
snuck up
behind the speed-camera van,

672
00:33:35,081 --> 00:33:37,683

On the downside
is everything else.

Er... The centrepiece
of this dashboard here
looks like a...

How can I put this?
...like a lady part.

732
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:22,648
And then
the door lining here,
well, it's just hideous.

733
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:27,353
It look like
a footballer's...

734
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:31,623
It's annoying, cos Aston
have done such a good job
with the rest of this car.

735
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,259
I was staggered

736
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,661

at the track yesterday.

00:42:10,662 --> 00:42:13,498
...James and I
made a run for it.

845
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,602
And, in case he caught up
with us on the motorway,

846
00:42:16,668 --> 00:42:18,604
we took some precautions.

847
00:42:20,606 --> 00:42:24,743
This is the work of a genius.

848
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,312
We are now protected
from Mr Hammond completely.

849
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:37,789
James's head was a bit of
a problem with this plan,
but we've solved it.

850
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:44,830
Don't worry if you don't
recognise me, viewers.
It's me.

851
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:49,000
The question was,
would Richard Hammond
recognise him?

852
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,670
Here comes Richard Hammond.
Just look straight ahead.

853
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:53,338
Look straight ahead.

854
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,406
And the answer was...

855
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:56,842
JAMES: Not looking.

856
00:42:59,645 --> 00:43:01,412
Oh, God. He's waving at me!

857
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:03,014
(DIXIE-HORN BLARES)

858
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:06,517
Well, he's clocked us,
hasn't he?

859
00:43:06,652 --> 00:43:09,988
I think you're better off
getting stone chips
than looking like that.

860
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:13,659
Mayday. Mayday.
I'm disintegrating.

861
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:18,263
Whilst James
unwrapped himself

862
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:21,466
and Richard filled up
through his ruined present,

863
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:24,469
I had another brainwave.

864
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:27,405
I'm gonna lead him into
the centre of Vicenza, yeah?

865
00:43:27,472 --> 00:43:28,940
Yes.

866
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:31,276
I've sent out a tweet,
and I put this on Facebook,

867
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:35,380
saying that Richard Hammond
will be appearing
in the main square, OK?

868
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,548
-Yes.
-So he gets out.

869
00:43:37,683 --> 00:43:38,717
-He's mobbed.
-Yes.

870
00:43:38,784 --> 00:43:41,753
-We scarper, OK?
-Very good. I like it.

871
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,421
-Have you done it in Italian?
-Yes.

872
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:46,391
Oh, good. Only thing is,
I've made a slight mistake.

873
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,493
I have said here that
Richard Hammond will be -

874
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:52,698
I wanted to say "appearing"
but I've put
"exhibiting himself".

875
00:43:52,698 --> 00:43:54,165
Well, it'll get a crowd.

876
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:03,508
Back on the move,
I put my plan into action.

877
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:06,812
I thought we'd turn off
the motorway here, Hammond.

878
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:09,380
Vicenza's got
a doughnuting area in it.

879
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:11,349
Has it?

880
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:12,918
Yeah, no old statues.

881
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:17,088
There's Starbucks,
McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts.

882
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,190
I'm right, aren't I, James?

883
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:22,593
I think they've got
an American football team,
haven't they, in Vicenza?

884
00:44:22,728 --> 00:44:25,964
They have,
the Vicenza Red Bears.

885
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:27,733
OK.

886
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:29,300
We'll have
a little mooch about.

887
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:34,439
Soon, we were approaching
the centre of the town.

888
00:44:35,741 --> 00:44:37,843
I just need a crowd
big enough

889
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:41,479
to keep him occupied
for 20 minutes.

890
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:44,182
I don't know how many people
will have read my tweet.

891
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:46,785
A couple of hundred.

892
00:44:48,754 --> 00:44:51,056
I was nearly right.

893
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:52,958
(CHEERING)

894
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:55,794
Oh, my God.

895
00:45:00,766 --> 00:45:03,034
This has gone really wrong.

896
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:09,775
-This has gone
so spectacularly wrong.
-Jeremy!

897
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:15,180
(CHEERING AND WHOOPING)

898
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:18,116
RICHARD: Oh, my word!

899
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:19,885
Hello. Is there an event on?

900
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:21,987
(CHEERING CONTINUES)

901
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:24,823
It's Mr Hammond
you're looking for.

902
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:29,394
Mr Hammond is in the Dodge.

903
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,364
Oh, this is unnerving.

904
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,803
Is it always this busy here?
What's going on today?

905
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,811
Look at that, we're free,
and Hammond is stuck.
(LAUGHS)

906
00:45:48,814 --> 00:45:50,681
Yes. Yes.

907
00:45:50,816 --> 00:45:51,883
We're out.

908
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,219
Hammond is doomed!

909
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:55,486
He's doomed!

910
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:58,857
Leaving Hammond
in what he thought

911
00:45:58,924 --> 00:46:00,859
was the muscle-car capital
of Italy...

912
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:02,360
(REVVING)

913
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:03,428
(CHEERING)

914
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:06,832
They like a rev.
They do like a rev here.

915
00:46:06,898 --> 00:46:09,835
...James and I
headed out of town.

916
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:13,004
Right, good.
Venice, 23 miles away.

917
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:19,644
I think it's fair to say

918
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:24,449
that this entire trip
has been a total disaster.

919
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:29,720
But the Aston Martin has been
the complete opposite.

920
00:46:29,855 --> 00:46:33,558
It was much, much better than
I thought it was going to be
on the track.

921
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,863
It's staggeringly civilised
and quiet on the road.

922
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:41,466
It really is a superb
grand tourer,

923
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:44,435
and it is achingly pretty.

924
00:46:44,502 --> 00:46:48,273
Especially with this
beautiful orange paintwork.

925
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:53,544
JAMES: Jeremy may have been
won over by his brown Aston,

926
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:57,015
but I was truly smitten
with the Rolls-Royce.

927
00:46:58,049 --> 00:46:59,717
What is it about
a Rolls-Royce?

928
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:03,955
A lot of people would say
this isn't a car-lover's car.

929
00:47:04,022 --> 00:47:06,357
It's not sporty,
it's not dynamic,

930
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:07,993
it doesn't have modes
for you to set.

931
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:09,327
You can't even change
the gears.

932
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:12,297
You can only put it
in forward or reverse.

933
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:16,634
And yet, I think this is a
car for people who love cars,

934
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:20,205
because it gives you
an entirely different
driving experience.

935
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:23,208
There is no other car that's
quite like a Rolls-Royce,

936
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:26,011
no other car that cossets you
in the same way.

937
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:29,714
This is a car
that is kind to you.

938
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:33,218
I think it is actually
impossible to be unhappy
if you're driving this car.

939
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:35,020
And look at what
I've had to put up with:

940
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:36,922
Richard Hammond
and Richard Hammond,

941
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:38,356
Richard Hammond,
the Dodge Hellcat,

942
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:41,927
Richard Hammond,
the Dodge Hellcat,
and I'm still happy.

943
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:48,166
JEREMY:
As we arrived in Venice,
we were in good spirits.

944
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:51,169
And, the next morning,

945
00:47:51,236 --> 00:47:53,038
we did
what all our predecessors

946
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:55,573
on the Grand Tour
would have done.

947
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,309
We took in the sights
from the water.

948
00:48:01,746 --> 00:48:03,248
It's so nice without Hammond.

949
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:05,984
Dinner last night...

950
00:48:06,051 --> 00:48:09,120
Nice to order food
without somebody going,
"Have you got any chips?"

951
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:12,557
Yeah. "Where's the ketchup?"

952
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,826
JEREMY: He is never,
ever going to get out of
that square. I mean never.

953
00:48:15,961 --> 00:48:18,997
JAMES: I assume he's been
crushed to death by now,
or torn apart.

954
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:22,600
Have you seen that?

955
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,369
-Yeah.
-What a moron.

956
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:27,672
JAMES: An inappropriate
brown powerboat.

957
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,074
JEREMY: Orange.

958
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,442
Is that allowed round here?
I'm surprised, actually.

959
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:35,080
Lads!

960
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:38,883
JAMES: What a yob.
JEREMY: I thought
his Hellcat was bad.

961
00:48:38,984 --> 00:48:40,618
Hammond, no.

962
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:45,590
That's really inappropriate,
Hammond. Don't do that.

963
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:46,824
This is very wobbly.

964
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:49,494
JEREMY: Don't...
Don't do that, Hammond.

965
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,129
(LAUGHS) Yeah!

966
00:48:51,196 --> 00:48:53,131
Who's hungry?
Who's for doughnuts?

967
00:48:53,198 --> 00:48:54,699
Hammond, stop it!

968
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,567
-(RICHARD LAUGHS)
-Whoa!

969
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:59,404
Yah! Water doughnut!

970
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,671
Stop it!

971
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:05,176
(RICHARD LAUGHS, JAMES GASPS)

972
00:49:07,812 --> 00:49:10,348
JEREMY: Hammond! Hammond!

973
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:13,718
(CHEERING)

974
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,122
What?

975
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:21,026
Grand Tour. We can
do it again next year.

976
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:23,228
Next year?
Do it again next year?

977
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,499
Not only
did you knock us into

978
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:31,602
the sewage-infested waters
of Venice...

979
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:34,772
you cut the present
we gave you in half.

980
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:36,841
No, hang on a minute.
No, it was only like

981
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:39,477
a two-piece jigsaw puzzle, and
I put it back together again.

982
00:49:39,544 --> 00:49:41,946
Look, there it is.
See? Perfect.

983
00:49:42,047 --> 00:49:43,181
-Hammond?
-Yes.

984
00:49:43,248 --> 00:49:47,285
Art galleries
do not saw artworks in half

985
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:49,454
just to get them
up the stairs, you moron.

986
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,422
Anyway, listen,
before we move on,

987
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,458
can I just say something
about that Aston Martin?

988
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:56,261
Not to wind you two up.
I genuinely mean this.

989
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,495
It's an amazing car.

990
00:49:57,562 --> 00:49:59,497
I know the steering wheel
is square.

991
00:49:59,564 --> 00:50:00,931
-And it was brown.
-Yes.

992
00:50:01,066 --> 00:50:03,068
And I know the interior
wasn't very nice,

993
00:50:03,134 --> 00:50:04,735
but, genuinely,
it's affected me.

994
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:07,972
It's been living up here
ever since I got back.

995
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:09,440
And talking of up here,

996
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:13,544
it's now time to play
Celebrity Brain Crash.

997
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:20,451
(CHEERING)

998
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:23,421
Yes, it's time
for a top celebrity

999
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:26,991
to try their hand at our
fearsome test of skill,

1000
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:29,294
co-ordination
and observation.

1001
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,029
Now, so far,
I should explain,

1002
00:50:32,097 --> 00:50:35,333
no celebrity has actually
made it to the tent.

1003
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,734
-No, they've all died.
-(LAUGHTER)

1004
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:40,271
Yes, but our fingers
are crossed for this week,

1005
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:43,274
because our guest
is a huge star.

1006
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:46,344
You'll have seen him
in Mission Impossible,

1007
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:50,515
Star Trek,
Shaun Of The Dead,Hot Fuzz,

1008
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:53,251
and he's here to talk about
his new movie -

1009
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:55,320
Spielberg movie -
Ready Player One .

1010
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:58,456
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've got Simon Pegg!

1011

(CHEERING)

1012
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:04,329
And there he is.

00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,365
There he is,
ladies and gentlemen,
with his Cornetto.

1014
00:51:07,432 --> 00:51:08,899
RICHARD: Always a Cornetto.

1015
00:51:08,966 --> 00:51:12,370
JEREMY: He's battled aliens,
he's battled zombies,

1016
00:51:12,437 --> 00:51:14,038
he should have
no problem at all

1017
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:16,474
with a short stroll through
this pretty little town.

1018
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:18,976
Of all his films,
it's Paul that I like best.

1019
00:51:19,043 --> 00:51:22,180
-I think that stands out.
- Paul was the forerunner
of Ted, really.

1020
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:24,149
-It was.
-It was first. It came first.

1021
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:27,518
Hot Fuzz .
It's Hot Fuzz for me, just
because of the fight scenes.

1022
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,587
RICHARD: There he is.
He's on the bridge.

1023
00:51:29,654 --> 00:51:32,423
-It looks like he's being
hassled by seagulls.
-(LAUGHTER)

1024
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,925
They're after his Cornetto,
I think.

1025
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:36,461
Yeah, they're after his...
Oh!

1026
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:38,296
(LAUGHTER)

1027
00:51:38,363 --> 00:51:40,765
-Oh!
-(APPLAUSE)

1028
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:42,333
Oh, God.

1029
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,169
There's literally
nothing we can do.

1030
00:51:44,169 --> 00:51:45,570
We're gonna get a reputation.

1031
00:51:47,172 --> 00:51:48,439
Does that mean
he's not coming on then?

1032
00:51:48,506 --> 00:51:50,408
-Well, James...
-(LAUGHTER)

1033
00:51:50,475 --> 00:51:54,379
...he fell into the harbour,
and the icy North Sea waters
are now filling his lungs.

1034
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:56,781
It's a no.
He's not coming on.

1035
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,416
Oh, God...

1036
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:02,420
Well, look, I...

1037
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:05,190
-Oh.
-I anticipated
something like this.

1038
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:06,757
-Did you?
-Yes.

1039
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:09,960
And so I prepared something else
we can do to fill the time.

1040
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:16,000
It's this. You know Google
have been trying to build
a self-driving car?

1041
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,568
For seven years
they've been at it.

1042
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:20,271
We've got a picture of it.
It's absolutely hideous.

1043
00:52:20,338 --> 00:52:22,540
I was thinking,
"Well, how hard can it be?"

1044
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:24,309
RICHARD: Oh, God.
-(LAUGHTER)

1045
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:26,344
Ten days ago I thought,
"I'll give it a bash," okay?

1046
00:52:26,411 --> 00:52:28,045
And I've already finished it.

1047
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:29,414
-Have you?
-Yes, it's here.

1048
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,615
-Is it?
-Yes, it's here.

1049
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:32,483
Let's bring it out.
It's phone-operated.

1050
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,552
-So, erm...
Hang on. Just set....
-What?

1051
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:37,121
No, here it comes.
Right, forwards.

1052
00:52:37,222 --> 00:52:38,223
Forwards.

1053
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:39,657
Please try not
to be distracted

1054
00:52:39,724 --> 00:52:43,428
by the harrowing scenes...
of...

1055
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:46,397
Left, left. Straight.

1056
00:52:46,464 --> 00:52:49,734
...the harrowing scenes
of Simon's lifeless corpse

1057
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,102
being fished
from the harbour.

1058
00:52:52,237 --> 00:52:54,239
I know that's upsetting
for some people.

1059
00:52:54,305 --> 00:52:57,308
Right, we need to make
a bit of a a hole
in the crowd back here,

1060
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:59,477
cos I'm gonna bring it
into the tent studio

1061
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:01,512
so you can see
how brilliant I've been.

1062
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:03,348
-(LAUGHTER)
-Forwards.

1063
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:06,251
RICHARD: Really?
-That is brilliant!

1064
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:08,253
-It's...
-Cheer, everybody.

1065
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:09,754
(CHEERING)

1066
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,990
Left. Left. Left.

1067
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:15,260
-It's hideous!
-Left. Forwards.

1068
00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:20,731
-It's... So, hold on.
-Stop. Stop.

1069
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:22,967
It's not brilliant.
It's hideous, is what it is.

1070
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,302
How can you say it's hideous?

1071
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:26,771
I've copied Google's
styling completely.

1072
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:30,275
Is that a septic tank?

1073
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:31,842
-Yes, it is.
-(LAUGHTER)

1074
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:35,045
Cut in half, and then
I've mounted on the top

1075
00:53:35,112 --> 00:53:36,414
this chaise longue,

1076
00:53:36,481 --> 00:53:38,783
so the owner can recline
in great comfort.

1077
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:41,619
Yeah, yeah.
How does it actually work?

1078
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:42,587
Brilliantly.

1079
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:44,855
Down here,
a very small little camera.

1080
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:49,294
That feeds a view of the road
ahead to the system inside.

1081
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,496
-What system?
-Well, there's a bonnet here.

1082
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:54,198
Come round, I'll show you
the... the gubbins. Ready?

1083
00:53:54,299 --> 00:53:56,501
(CLEARS THROAT) There it is.

1084
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,703
RICHARD:
Well, it's just a man!

1085
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:00,738
-It's just a man in there!
-It isn't.

1086
00:54:01,939 --> 00:54:02,740
It is!

1087
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:08,313
No. No.

1088
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:13,684
It's not just a man.
This is a Romanian man.

1089
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:14,952
(LAUGHTER)

1090
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:18,323
I am providing employment
for newcomers to our country.

1091
00:54:18,356 --> 00:54:20,458
-Oh, God.
-What do you mean, "Oh, God"?

1092
00:54:20,525 --> 00:54:22,493
Think about it. Google, yes?

1093
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,464
Google, they use electronics
to take away the work
of a man.

1094
00:54:26,531 --> 00:54:29,567
This gives him a job,
it gives him dignity.

1095
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:32,136
-Dignity?
-Yes, dignity.

1096
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:33,738
It's a bit feudal, isn't it?

1097
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:36,574
It's a bit brilliant
is what it is.
Let me close the bonnet.

1098
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:38,343
I'm gonna go for
my first-ever drive.

1099
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:40,177
I'll go to t'foot
of our stairs here,

1100
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:42,146
which is a Yorkshire
expression.

1101
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:45,850
The great thing is,
it's so easy to get in
and out of, you know.

1102
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:47,117
Look, there I am.

1103
00:54:47,184 --> 00:54:48,819
(LAUGHTER)

1104
00:54:48,886 --> 00:54:52,423
-Now I don't need the phone.
I can use my speaking tube.
-Oh, God!

1105
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:54,692
There's a man in there!

1106
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:57,027
What's Romanian
for "backwards"?

1107
00:54:57,094 --> 00:54:58,496
Înapoi, I think.

1108
00:54:58,563 --> 00:55:01,198
Înapoi. It is, obviously.
It's bilingual.

1109
00:55:01,265 --> 00:55:02,700
This is evil!

1110
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:05,603
Google hasn't made it work,
I have.

1111
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:07,938
Îna... Backwards.
I'll just stick to English.

1112
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:09,840
Backwards. Backwards.

1113
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:13,511
Thank you so much.

1114
00:55:13,578 --> 00:55:16,947
British engineering,
ladies and gentlemen,

1115
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:19,484
with Romanian parts.

1116
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,219
What a combination that is.

1117
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:24,021
Shit! Ah, my head!

1118
00:55:29,193 --> 00:55:30,828
Yep. Whatever.

1119
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:36,000
-Anyway, I'm glad he's gone.
-So am I.

1120
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:39,637
No, I'm particularly glad
because of what's
coming up next.

1121
00:55:39,704 --> 00:55:42,673
Oh, yes! Yes. Now, right at
the beginning of this series,

1122
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:46,110
Jeremy Clarkson said,
when we were at a race track
in Portugal -

1123
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,145
and he said it
on the television -

1124
00:55:48,212 --> 00:55:50,948
that if his McLaren P1
wasn't faster

1125
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:54,485
than Hammond's Porsche 918
or my Ferrari The Ferrari,

1126
00:55:54,552 --> 00:55:56,320
we could
knock his house down.

1127
00:55:56,421 --> 00:55:57,888
Well, it wasn't,

1128
00:55:57,955 --> 00:56:01,258
so, one weekend when
Jeremy was away, we...

1129
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:02,893
Well, roll the tape.

1130
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:05,963
JAMES: This is it,

1131
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:10,735
200 years old and built from
beautiful Cotswold stone.

1132
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:12,670
Now, I want to make it
absolutely clear

1133
00:56:12,737 --> 00:56:15,873
that this is
Jeremy Clarkson's
actual house.

1134
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,776
Yeah, it really is.
I'd swear to my children's
lives on that.

1135
00:56:18,843 --> 00:56:21,846
It's Jeremy's house.
He bought it when he
fell in love with the view.

1136
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:23,614
It is a lovely view,
actually.

1137
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:26,684
It is. It'll be even better
soon, without a house in it.

1138
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:31,556
RICHARD: Our plan
was to smash the place down

1139
00:56:31,622 --> 00:56:34,324
with some big
demolition equipment.

1140
00:56:34,459 --> 00:56:35,760
But there was a problem.

1141
00:56:40,164 --> 00:56:43,133
In this country,
you can't knock a house down

1142
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,671
if the council find evidence
of bats living in it.

1143
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,639
Well, they did,
and now we've been told

1144
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:51,809
we've got to take the roof
off, quietly and by hand,

1145
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:55,379
to give the bats the chance
to go and live elsewhere.

1146
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,949
James, I can't help but
notice I am doing
all of the work here.

1147
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:01,619
JAMES: Yeah, you're gonna
have to. I don't like it.

1148
00:57:01,686 --> 00:57:05,790
RICHARD: It's just a ladder!
It's a simple enough thing
to operate. Climb it!

1149
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:08,526
Not if you're me, it's not.
How many bats are there?

1150
00:57:08,593 --> 00:57:09,594
-One.
-One?

1151
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,762
-Yes, a bat.
-Just kill it.

1152
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:13,498
We'll go to prison, mate.
We can't.

1153
00:57:13,531 --> 00:57:15,800
Just because that little
winged-mouse bastard

1154
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:18,302
is hanging upside down in there,
feeling smug with himself

1155
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,705
cos I'm up this ladder, we
can't knock the house down?

1156
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:23,708
We've got to do it,
no choice, so get up here
and get on with it.

1157
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,611
Hammond, I hate...
I hate heights.
You know I do.

1158
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:28,713
I hate ladders, I hate bats.

1159
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,649
RICHARD: Many hours later,

1160
00:57:31,716 --> 00:57:35,019
and with no help at all
from Spider-Man,

1161
00:57:35,085 --> 00:57:39,023
the roof was finally off
and the bat was free to move.

1162
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:40,124
But would it?

1163
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,059
Why doesn't it go and live
in there?

1164
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,394
Because, let's be honest,
that's perfect
if you're a bat.

1165
00:57:44,529 --> 00:57:48,833
Yeah, well, it might, but
it's got to decide to do so.

1166
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:51,435
-Can we encourage it?
-Yes, James.

1167
00:57:51,536 --> 00:57:55,806
Why don't you go and stand
in that barn and squeak in
a sultry and erotic manner?

1168
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,543
(OWL HOOTING)

1169
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:00,911
RICHARD: That night,
Spider-Man stood in the barn,

1170
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:03,748
squeaking in a sultry
and erotic manner...

1171
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:05,683
(JAMES SQUEAKING)

1172
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:08,919
...and the bat
eventually succumbed.

1173
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:11,722
So, the next morning,
we were ready to go.

1174
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:31,141
This thing really works!
This rocks!

1175
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:32,409
Oh, my word!

1176
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:35,880
At this rate, we'd be done
and dusted in no time.

1177
00:58:35,946 --> 00:58:39,283
However, my finickity
colleague had an issue.

1178
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,286
-Hammond!
-What?

1179
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,854
-Stop!
-What?

1180
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:44,755
Stop!

1181
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:46,323
You don't just smash it
to pieces.

1182
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:49,059
You're supposed to
dismantle it and leave it
in neat piles.

1183
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:51,729
It's got to be tidied up.
You can't leave it like that.

1184
00:58:51,796 --> 00:58:54,431
It's actually quicker
if you do it methodically.

1185
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:56,266
Oh, God.
Only you would say that!

1186
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:58,603
You want neat piles of bits
that can be carted away.

1187
00:58:58,636 --> 00:59:01,105
You need to work on that bit
and that bit to start with,

1188
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:02,940
then the rest
falls neatly into a heap.

1189
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:05,109
How can you make
even this boring?

1190
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:07,477
It's not boring. It's the
way... I've watched it done.

1191
00:59:07,612 --> 00:59:10,314
That's how you do it.
You don't just smash it.
I'll do it.

1192
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:14,952
James then commandeered
my machine...

1193
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:17,922
so I got another one
and carried on regardless.

1194
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,725
And bang!

1195
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:28,498
JAMES: Ah! I've got it!

1196
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:30,635
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

1197
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:36,340
JAMES: Oh, it's like winning
one of those things
at the fair.

1198
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:40,077
RICHARD:
Thanks to me, at least,
progress was being made.

1199
00:59:40,144 --> 00:59:40,945
However...

1200
00:59:41,011 --> 00:59:44,148
-(CREAKING)
-I'm stuck on something.

1201
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:53,123
Oh! Oh, I've broken
my digger. Oh, dear.

1202
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:56,961
With me out of action
and James achieving nothing,

1203
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:58,963
a new approach was needed.

1204
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:01,131
But first,
we had to clear the site

1205
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:03,768
of Jeremy's
most treasured possessions.

1206
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:05,936
Shakira.

1207
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:08,038
Shakira.

1208
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,675
Shakira.

1209
01:00:14,144 --> 01:00:15,913
Oh!

1210
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:19,283
That is a... strong image.

1211
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:23,287
It's a tiny doll with pins
in it, and your face.

1212
01:00:26,691 --> 01:00:30,027
Look, this is his photo
album. It's probably
really precious.

1213
01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:33,363
-Oh, it's a bit disturbing.
-What?

1214
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:40,470
-They're all of me.
-Yep.

1215
01:00:40,537 --> 01:00:45,442
JAMES: At this point, we
decided not to clear the site
of his treasured possessions

1216
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:47,812
and moved swiftly to plan B.

1217
01:00:48,846 --> 01:00:51,148
Short ceremony,
say a few words?

1218
01:00:51,215 --> 01:00:52,249
Nah.

1219
01:01:09,734 --> 01:01:11,101
(SIGHS)

1220
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:14,939
RICHARD: That...
JAMES: That got it.

1221
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:21,178
(CHEERING)

1222
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:26,383
Done.

1223
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:30,821
So, let's just get this
straight.

1224
01:01:31,822 --> 01:01:34,091
You blew up...

1225
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:36,326
that picture of me
on the horse?

1226
01:01:36,393 --> 01:01:37,594
-Yep.
-Yep.

1227
01:01:37,661 --> 01:01:39,764
-(LAUGHTER)
-Yep.

1228
01:01:39,797 --> 01:01:43,433
And on that terrible
disappointment, it's time to
end. Thanks for watching.

1229
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,634
See you next week.

1230
01:01:44,769 --> 01:01:46,236
-(CHEERING)
-Good night!

1231
01:01:47,772 --> 01:01:49,840
