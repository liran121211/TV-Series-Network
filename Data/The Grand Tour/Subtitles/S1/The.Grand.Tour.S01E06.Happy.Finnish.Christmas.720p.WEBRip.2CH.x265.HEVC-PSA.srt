00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,890
Hello, everybody.

5
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,940
How are you? How are you?

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,630
Thank you. Good to see you.
Thank you for coming.

(CHEERING AND WHISTLING)

8
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,870
Cold out there!

9
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,320
That is cold.

10
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,380
Hello, everybody!

11
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,480
Hello!

12
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:30,150
Hello. Welcome to The Grand
Tour. Happy Christmas.

13
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,800
This week, we are coming -

14
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,330
if you can see through
the drizzle dribbling down
the windows -

15
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,770
from Scandinavia.

00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,960
(CHEERING)

17
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,960
Oh, yeah.

18
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,330
This, of course...

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,730
This, of course, is the home
of those gloomy dramas

20
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,750
where a weird woman
in a jumper solves a murder

21
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,680
by staring at a lake
for six hours.

22
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,890
(LAUGHTER)

23
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,950
This will probably be
the jolliest programme

24
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,320
to come out of this
neck of the woods since...

25
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,720
... Four Funerals
And A Funeral .

26
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,130
JEREMY: Yeah.
-(LAUGHTER)

27
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,530
Swedish rom-com that was.
Erm...

28
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,420
When Harry Shot Sally .

29
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,790
Oh, a laugh a minute.

30
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,300
The Girl With
The Pearl Necklace. No.

00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,740
(LAUGHTER)

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,910
-That's another sort of
Scandinavian film.
-Really?

33
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,370
Yeah.

34
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,410
Anyway, specifically,

35
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,170
we are deep inside
the Arctic Circle in Finland.

00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,340
(CHEERING)

37
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,580
There you go.
And Finland, of course...

38
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:33,460
Finland, of course, is home
to every single racing driver
currently...

39
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,050
-What?
-What, all of them?

40
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,350
(LAUGHTER)

41
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,190
Well, apart from
Nico Rosberg, who is Finnish,

42
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,630
but, for some reason,
claims he's German.

43
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,700
(JEERING)

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,330
Why does he do that?
I have no idea.

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,560
Who else is there, then?

46
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,840
Well, there's Mika Salo,

47
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,630
Mika Häkkinen,
Kimi Räikkönen.

48
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,370
Hang on, they're just
anagrams of the same name,
aren't they?

49
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,370
-(LAUGHTER)
-Then you've got rallying.

50
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,710
There's Tommi Mäkinen,
Timo Mäkinen,

51
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,190
Juha Kankkunen, Ari Vatanen.

52
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,750
More anagrams.

(LAUGHS) Really?

58
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,870
I'm getting
slightly carried away now.

59
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,130
Seriously, I went on
Wikipedia last night

60
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,370
to look for famous Finns
who aren't racing drivers.

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,710
Put up the list I found.

62
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,440
And I noticed something -
they're all men.

63
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,470
-(LAUGHTER)
-All of them.

64
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,780
Are there any famous
Finnish women?

65
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,270
-(MUTTERING)
-Finnish people?

66
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,520
(LAUGHTER)

67
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,420
Nobody thinks so.
They're all... (GRUNTS)

68
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,740
I know why, OK?

69
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,460
It's because all Finnish
women, at the age of 19,

70
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,130
move to England
to be au pairs.

71
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,860
(LAUGHTER)

72
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,750
I actually had three Finnish
au pairs over the years
for my children.

73
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,530
-Did you?
-Yeah. It was always funny.

74
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,190
You'd go to Heathrow airport
to pick up your new au pair,

75
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,300
and there'd always be a row
of 30-something fathers
waiting at the gate

76
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,430
for their Scandinavian
au pair to come out.

77
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,800
(LAUGHTER)

78
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,900
And there was one year
I've never forgotten.

79
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,610
This huge moose
lumbered out of the door,

80
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,150
and the man next to me looked
at his piece of paper and
went, "Oh, for God's sake!"

81
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,560
(LAUGHTER)

82
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,450
That's not good.

83
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,050
-Shall we get on with
the show?
-Yes, good idea.

84
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,570
Because tonight
in our television
programme about cars...

85
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,530
I eat some cheddar.

86
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,030
Richard says
he doesn't want any.

87
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,130
I don't want cheese.

88
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,720
And James compares
a Ford GT40 to a Ferrari P3.

89
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,290
Avanti!

90
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,160
But first, if you are
watching this in America,

91
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,920
you may be amazed to hear

92
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:50,130
that the Ford Mustang
has never been sold,
officially, in the UK.

93
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,860
Well, until now,
because Ford has now decided

94
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,970
that the latest Mustang
will be sold in the UK

95
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,140
with a V8 engine
and right-hand drive.

96
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,580
Mm, and this has made
our other resident American
very happy.

97
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,680
He was so excited, in fact,

98
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,380
that when the first
right-hand-drive Mustang

99
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,380
arrived at the docks
in the UK,

100
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,790
he was actually there
to meet it.

101
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,790
(LAUGHTER)

102
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,510
It'll be here any minute.

103
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,420
That is it. Are we ready?

104
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,930
This is the moment.
It's touched down!

105
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,930
Go, go, go!

106
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,060
♫ New World Symphony (Dvorak)

107
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,260
Look, it's a bit gloomy,
isn't it?

108
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,860
It's not very welcoming.
Have you got anything
more upbeat?

109
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,710

Oh. Sorry about that.

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,030
We really are useless
over here.

120
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,070
It's one of the reasons we
needed your help in the war.

121
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,980
I decided that, first of all,

122
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,270
I'd show
the new Mustang around,

123
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,620
so I headed for London...

124
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,210
which is the capital city.

125
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,780
Ah, now,
this is Tower Bridge.

126
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,850
Interesting.
It's very, very old.

127
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,180
But it folds
completely in half

128
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,140
so that, in the old days,
the horses could go through.

129
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,350
Now, that's
the Houses of Parliament,

130
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,850
which are a series of houses
in which we keep
all our idiots.

131
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,520
That clock thing,
that's Big Ben.

132
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,740
I know it's not what you call
big, but... but we couldn't
just call it Ben.

133
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,400
And that is the Cenotaph,

134
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,210
where we remember those
who died fighting for us.

135
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,640
Slowing down a bit here.

136
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,040
Show some respect.

137
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,850
No idea what that is.
It wasn't here this morning.

138
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,460
A cyclist, you want to be
careful of those.

139
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,790
Small
but very angry creatures.

140
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,360
That's the army.

141
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,700
They're the ones
who shot at your White House.

142
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,000
Sorry about that.

143
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,740
Having seen
all of the sights,

144
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,830
we headed out of town

145
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,680
so I could do this.

146
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,670
(ENGINE THRUMS)

147
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,690
There it is.

148
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,910
That is the soundtrack
that Britain has been missing
for 51 years -

149
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,310
real American V8 muscle.

150
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,060
We just don't make cars like
this on our side of the pond.

151
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,900
All that
lazy-but-determined torque.

152
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,900
Squeeze the throttle
in any gear at any speed...

153
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,440
...and there's
an inevitability
to the way it moves off.

154
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,700
It's like arm wrestling
a solar system -
you're gonna lose.

155
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,920
It is weird...

156
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,030
driving a Mustang
from this side.

157
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,800
It's like suddenly
changing your mind

158
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,900
after 50 years of marriage
and sleeping on the other
side of the bed.

159
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,230
It's also weird
driving a car with a big V8,

160
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,370
reversing camera,
air-conditioned seats,

161
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:32,200
rain-sensing wipers
that you can buy for £37,000.

162
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,740
That's half of what you'd pay
for a BMW M4. Half.

163
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,180
Once we were in
the countryside proper,

164
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,760
I continued
my sightseeing tour.

165
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,960
Look, I've drawn your badge
on a hill.

166
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,260
Jeremy did that one.

167
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,830
Sorry.

168
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,180
Eventually,
we arrived at Stonehenge.

169
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,450
That,
you'll be amazed to learn,

170
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,480
is an ancient calendar.

171
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,520
Or a clock. Or a church.

172
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:23,260
My tour of Britain
was then interrupted
by an unwelcome arrival.

173

174
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,770
What are you doing here?

00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,670
Well,
I have come to remind you -

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,500
cos you've obviously
forgotten,

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,960
cos you're too giddy -

178
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,100
that we have no need
for the Mustang in Britain.

179
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,280
Because if you want to spend,

180
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,450
what, £30,000-£35,000
on a fast Ford,

181
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,980
you'd buy a Focus RS, cos
that was designed for here.

182
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,620
No, you'd settle for that
in the UK

183
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,410
because you couldn't
buy this, but now you can.

184
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,810
That is the point.

185
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,830
Would you wear chaps?

186
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,030
No, because we have trousers.

187
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,060
What about cowboy...
Oh, you are. Cowboy boots.

188
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,800
Well, it's appropriate.
I'm welcoming...

189
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,460
Listen, I don't want
everything from America,
I just want the Mustang.

190
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,690
-Stupid.
-No, America--

191
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,360
It wasn't designed for here.

192
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,830
-Would you wear a Stetson?
-Well, no.

193
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,840
"It's cold out,
I'll wear a Stetson."

194
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,740
No! You wear a bobble hat.

195
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,470
That's a bobble hat.

196
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,370
Oh! No, hang on.

197
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,510
-I've just realised.
-What?

198
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,120
Erm... I-I don't want
to talk to you any more.

199
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,230
(CHEERING)

200
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,860
Anyway...

201
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,510
Anyway, we shall
pick that up later on.

202
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,070
But right now
it's time to drop it a cog

203
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,870
and hook a left
into Conversation Street.

204
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,890
(MELLOW JAZZ)

205
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,050
(LAUGHTER)

206
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,890
-Serious. It's serious.
-It is serious stuff, this.

207
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,470
Now, look, in Britain
we are always being told

208
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,940
that the Scandinavians
are brilliant at driving,

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,770
and that's because they would
be, because they have
to deal with all that snow.

210
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,900
Mm, they're brilliant
because what they do
most of all is crash.

211
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,770
Well, you're absolutely
right, as it turns out,

212
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,650
cos I've got some interesting
statistics here. Erm...

213
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:27,220
In Britain, 1.2% of accidents
result in fatalities.

214
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,910
Here, I'm afraid, it's 5.1%.

215
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,910
Yeah, and it's not just
the Finns, either,

216
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,930
if I may be so bold.

217
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,380
Our Senior
International Producer -

218
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,930
that's his job title -

219
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,700
came over to Finland
the other day,

220
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,830
rented himself a BMW
at the airport -

221
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,170
not a Ford or an Opel,
you'll note, a BMW -

222
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,460
and on his way to
the location here,

223
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,800
this happened.

224
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,010
-(LAUGHTER)
RICHARD: He did! He did!

225
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,370
When I say he's our Senior
International Producer,

226
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,950
he's now our Junior
International Producer.

227
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,580
-Our Junior Local Producer.
-Yeah.

228
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,340
Very local. Specifically,
the stationery cupboard.

229
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,980
-He can produce that.
-That's all
he's in charge of.

230
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,950
How did he do that?!

231
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,350
The thing is, what I don't
understand is how the Finns
manage to go fast enough

232
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,420
to have a crash
of any sort at all,

233
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,690
because the speeding fines
here are insane.

234
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
They're means tested,

235
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,640
which means
a guy here recently

236
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,370
was caught doing 49mph
through a 30 zone

237
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:25,200
and he was fined
112,000 euros.

238
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,140
-That's a speeding fine!
-(AUDIENCE GASPS)

239
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,110
Are they really that high
in Finland?

240
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,080
-(AUDIENCE CONCUR)
-They are?

241
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,440
A hundred and twelve...

242
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,840
112,000.

243
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,580
-Imagine getting that
in the post!
-Well, it's interesting.

244
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,520
Actually, there was
a Finnish minister
recently said

245
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,290
that the government
needs those speeding fines

246
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,630
to balance the books,
they said.

247
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,090
They actually said, "Speeding
is good for the country."

248
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,460
-(LAUGHTER)
-That is actually what...

249
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,260
JEREMY:
Because it is. Every country.

250
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,500
RICHARD:
Right. We should adopt that.

251
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,380
-Speeding is good for you.
-It's your social duty.

252
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,610
-A bit more conversation
for you.
-Oh, good!

253
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,170
(LAUGHTER)

254
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,770
I think, with the exception
of Rolls-Royce,

255
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,840
Volvo now make the best
car interiors of anybody.

256
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,390
(AUDIENCE CALLING OUT)

257
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,480
They do.
They're very, very good.

258
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,520
I don't like to,
but I agree with you.

259
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:18,260
because I went in the new S90
the other day,
and the interior is superb.

260
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,800
-We've got
a picture of it here.
-Yes, that one.

261
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,490
JEREMY:
They use pale colours.

262
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,590
They've got pale-coloured
seats, pale-coloured carpets,
pale wood,

263
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,500
and that makes it feel light
and airy and spacious.

264
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,240
The only problem is
that in one of those

265
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,570
you couldn't enjoy
a chocolate Magnum ice cream.

266
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,570
(LAUGHTER)

267
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,670
It's all right,
I don't eat ice cream.

268
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,740
It's something to do with
being straight.

269
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,050
What? What?

270
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,410
Why are you applauding him?

271
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,180
What do you mean?

272
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,560
Are you saying
everyone who likes ice...?

273
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,720
Ice cream is a bit,
you know....

274
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,120
You're saying all children
are homosexual?

275
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,470
-No, but...
-(LAUGHTER)

276
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,270
There's nothing
wrong with it,

277
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,200
but a grown man
eating an ice cream,
you know, it's a bit...

278
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,940
it's that way
rather than that way.

279
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,270
-(LAUGHTER)
-It is...

00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,110
Welcome to the inside of
Richard Hammond's head.

281
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,200
I'm right. I can't believe
you can't see that.

282
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,620
It's easy.
It's in front of you.

283
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,590
You could enjoy a 99
in there.

284
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,520
-You mean a 69?
-No...

285
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,250
Ninety-nine. But you couldn't
have the chocolate thingy.

286
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,560
-My case rests!
-No, the chocolate thing!

287
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,620
-Exactly!
-You know what I mean.

288
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,100
No,
but if you had that Volvo,

289
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,500
you could have
a white magnum...

290
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,270
JEREMY: True.
-...or a Milky Bar.

291
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,900
Yeah,
but not a Double Decker.

292
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,290
Well, a Flake is worse.

293
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,440
-No, Double Decker's worse.
-(LAUGHTER)

294
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,630
Double Decker...

295
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,800
Do you all know what I mean
by the Double Decker?

296
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,970
It is unique among chocolate
confectionery items.

297
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,880
Take a bite
as you're driving along,

298
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,110
and a bit about this big, OK,

299
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,750
silently breaks away...

300
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,010
...goes down
between your legs

301
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,860
and melts.

302
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,390
So when you get out,

303
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,220
everybody thinks
you've had some kind
of trouser accident.

304
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,660
This big brown stain right...

305
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,600
-I know what you mean.
-It does happen.

306
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,230
A Flake is worse.

307
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,900
No, it just isn't!

308
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,740
A Flake is advertised
as "the crumbliest,
flakiest chocolate".

309
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,600
-It is worse.
-This is a hot topic on
Conversation Street.

310
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,630
It is!

311
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,710
I think we should settle it
here and now.

312
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,970
I'm going to go into
our travelling box.

313
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,240
(CHEERING)

314
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,990
Our travelling box of
chocolate confectionery,
and I'm going to...

315
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,950
Let's settle it
with a competition, yes?

316
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,430
I'm gonna give you
James's Flake

317
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,330
and you the Double Decker.

318
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:33,600
I'll turn that over, so then
you'll see how much spills
off as I eat the Flake.

319
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,660
-Not much. Right, ready?
-This is scientific.

320

(LAUGHTER)

321
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,970
Here we go. Oh.
Some of it's already crum...

322
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,460
This is cheating, this one.

323
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,200
RICHARD: OK, no,
clear away the debris.

324
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,170
JEREMY:
No, I need to... Jesus!

325
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,570
-That's part of eating it!
-It isn't part of eating it!
I haven't even begun.

326
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,570
-But you've got to unwrap it.
-Ssh!

327
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,540
Cheat.

328
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,080
♫ Only the crumbliest ♫

329
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,780

-Jeremy,
you know that advert?

He's going in. First bite.

Oh, it's a big fall
of chocolate!

338
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,230
JEREMY: Mm.
-It's a heavy sprinkling,
that.

339
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,300
That is just a light dusting
of chocolate.

340
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,200
-A light dusting, yeah, OK.
-Right, James May.

This is exciting, isn't it?

-This is a great
car programme.
-Groundbreaking stuff, yeah.

343
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,680
-Quiet, please.
-I can't believe...

344
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,120
-I can't believe this hasn't
been done before.
-(LAUGHTER)

345
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,220
He's going in.
He's taking a bite.

346
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,100
His poor old gnash...
His teeth!

347
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,500
-Oh!
-(AUDIENCE GASPS)

348
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,390
It's a catastrophic fall!
The clear winner...

349
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,860
The Double Decker
is worse than the Flake.

350
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,910
There's the Flake.
There's the Double Decker.

351
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,640
So, there we are.
Using science,
we have now established...

352
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,080
...if you've got a Volvo,
don't have a Double Decker.

353
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,410
-Ever.
-(LAUGHTER)

354
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,950
Or an ice cream, because
he... Oh, no, forget it.

355
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,050
Let's move a little further
along Conversation Street,
shall we?

356
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,930
Erm...
A few weeks ago, Amazon,

357
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,260
they ran an advert
for our show, and we're
rather pleased with it.

358
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,520
See, it's got everything in.

359
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,720
-Yeah, the sense of travel.
-Logo.

360
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,160
-And there's even the goat.
-Yeah, no, that's perfect.

361
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,100
-Everything you need there.
-All you need for the advert.
It's on the screen.

362
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,740
-It's good, isn't it?
-(LAUGHTER)

363
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,170
Yeah. All the essentials are
there. Everything you need.

364
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,640
Everything you need to see.

365
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,880
-(RICHARD LAUGHS)
JEREMY: Actually...

366
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,090
All the important stuff.

367
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,750
Hammond,
I'm sorry to do this,

368
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,760
but before the show launched,
Amazon did another advert,
OK,

369
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,760
which somebody sent to me
on a tweet,
which I screen grabbed,

370
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,690
so the quality's not good,
but I have brought it along.

371
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,930
Here it is.

372
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,020
Oh, for God's sake!

373
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,490
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

374
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,660
(GROANS)

375
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,530
I like their marketing
department a lot.

376
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,370
I think that's enough
Conversation Street,

377
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,980
so let's get back
to our film.

378
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,380
Yes. Earlier on,
I was in the right-hand-drive
Ford Mustang,

379
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
showing it the sights
around our country.

380
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,310
Unfortunately, he turned up

381
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:11,510
and tried to argue that
the similarly priced
Ford Focus was a better bet.

382
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:17,320
-Yeah, I did do that.
-I responded by driving off
and refusing to talk to you.

383
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,700
A bit rudely, I thought.

384
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,930
I'm sorry, this is my film,
my tour of England,

385
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,530
and I didn't want him
spoiling it.

386
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,340
This thing's bloody awesome.

387
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,910
Listen to that bellow.

388
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,120
This thing squats
on its haunches.

389
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,750
This is what
it's built to do.

390
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,800
Every crackle, pop and bang
is just connected to every
synapse and sinew in me.

391
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,360
Oh, no.

392
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,810
This is like a first date
for me, and on a first date,

393
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,700
you don't want a fat,
balding uncle tagging along.

394
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,320
So what I'm gonna do now...
is lose him.

395
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,320
It's Hammer Time!
Shock and awe!

396
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,760
It's Bond versus Bourne.

397
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,840
(HORNS BLARING)

398
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,410
He's got five litres.
I've only got 2.3.

399
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,510
Is he going twice as fast?
No, he is not.

400
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,760
Corner coming up.
There's no need to panic
any more in a Mustang,

401
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,690
because, for the first time,

402
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,080
the Mustang has
independent rear suspension.

403
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,590
Ooh! (LAUGHS)

404
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,810
The cornering speeds
this thing can achieve...
beggar belief.

405
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,450
(CHUCKLES)

406
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,810
How does it grip that well?!

407
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,360
(LAUGHS) I'm in a car chase
in a Mustang.

408
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,830
I am Steve McQueen.

409
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,560
Try that on.

410
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,580
I've got it in Sport Mode,

411
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,980
which makes the exhaust
pop and bang.

412
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,050
(POPPING)

413
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,120
Woohoo! Mine! (LAUGHS)

414
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,780
RICHARD: Oh, my God!

415
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,020
Flat out, yeah.

416
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,300
And it still grips!

417
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,800
What is the point of traction
control on this thing?

418
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,960
It's like putting a
nymphomania control on a nun.

419
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,820
Oh, God!

420
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,210
(HORN BLARES)

421
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,830
Where's he gone?

422
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,540
How did he do that?
How did he get away from me

423
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,370
in something
from the 18th century?

424
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,000
Especially when I'm driving

425
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:54,410
what is basically
a turbocharged barnacle.

426
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,570
This has the most
sophisticated
four-wheel-drive system

427
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,120
fitted to any car.

428
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,710
Not even a Nissan GTR
could live with this.

429
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,070
The Mustang, well,
that's for cruising down

430
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:18,140
the Pacific Coast Highway,
listening to Don Henley.

431
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,140
This is for storming up
the Stelvio Pass,

432
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,830
listening to the Clash.

433
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:30,010
But while it's a grippy,
technological masterpiece,

434
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,490
it still has the blue-collar
character of its ancestors.

435
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,820
In many ways, this reminds me
of the old Escort Cosworth,
and that was a great car.

436
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,630
I actually had one in
the '90s. I called it Gary.

437
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:48,090
It started every morning
and it always went,
"Do you want some?!"

438
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,660
It was just
John Terry, really,
with windscreen wipers.

439
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,800
RICHARD: Meanwhile,
having got rid of the ape,

440
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,840
I was back on
my sightseeing tour.

441
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,650
This is our Cheddar Gorge.

442
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,710
Obviously it's not as big
as your gorge.

443
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,620
The Grand Canyon is bigger.

444
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,950
Well, it's longer
and deeper... and wider.

445
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,660
Mm. But it doesn't have
any cheese in it.

446
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,380
Why can't you
just leave me alone?

447
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,360
I'm just saying, everything
in America comes with cheese,

448
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,030
apart from the Grand Canyon.

449
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,790
Whereas this canyon
does come with cheese,
and it's delicious.

450
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,490
-Here, have some.
-I don't want cheese.

451
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,100
-It's better than
Monterey Jack in a tube.
-You're ruining this!

452
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,940
No, you are, because
you are telling everyone

453
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,470
that the Mustang is better
than the Focus.

454
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,370
-Well, it is.
-It isn't.

455
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,110
-It is.
-No, it isn't.

456
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,180
Look, I'm not saying this
is perfect, cos it isn't.

457
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,410
There's a vertical choppiness
to the ride,
which is annoying.

458
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,390
If you put your phone
in the phone holder
in front of the gear lever

459
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,800
and then accelerate,
it shoots under the seat.

460
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,000
You never see it again.

461
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,960
Petrol tank, way too small.

462
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:59,670
-And the styling is a bit...
yobbish.
-A bit?!

463
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,170
But, Hammond, look at this.

464
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,030
Oh, yeah, you're right.

465
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,980
Half a century of Mustang
history, heritage and pride,

466
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,780
but it hasn't got a small
plastic strip on the door
in case you're a bit clumsy.

467
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:18,420
No, it's brilliant, that.
And... this is faster.

468
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,550
Well, no, it isn't.

469
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,490
-It is.
-No, it isn't.

470
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,030
-It is.
-It isn't.

471
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,690
RICHARD: At this point,
I decided to abandon my tour

472
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,700
and head for
the nearest airfield...

473
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,770
...to teach Clarkson
a lesson.

474
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,750
Right,
I've got 410 horsepower -

475
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,420
that's 100 more than him.

476
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,880
But there's something else
on here that's missing
on his Focus,

477
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,250
and it's this - "line lock".

478
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,590
So, engage it.
Press OK to initialise.

479
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,890
"Initialising.
Initialising complete.

480
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,980
Firmly apply and hold brake
to engage.

481
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,460
Engaged. Press OK to begin."

482
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,870
(REVVING)

483
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,300
What that's doing
is locking the front brakes,

484
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,130
so I can warm up my tyres.

485
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,400
Hm. That is an ideal feature
for people who wake up
in the morning and think,

486
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,270
"Do you know, I've got
too much tread on my tyres."

487
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,290
Yeah!
I'm doing that automatically!

488
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,060
What a moron.

489
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,830
With my tyres warmed up,

490
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,240
I took my place
on the start line.

491
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,400
Right, race mode,
launch control,

492
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,570
over-boost facility
on the turbocharger,

493
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,640
four-wheel-drive,
and a man with lightning
reactions at the wheel.

494
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,310
This car is going to
boing off the line
like a spring lamb.

495
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,650
Launch control, first gear,
and we're ready to go.

496
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,490
(REVVING)

497
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,420
Oh, he's away first.

498
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,390
The most incredible
launch control in the world!

499
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,610
Come on!

500
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,280
Come on, Jeremy.
Come on. You're winning.

501
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,620
RICHARD: Oh, reeling him in!

502
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,350
(LAUGHS)

503
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,240
(LAUGHS)

504
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,640
No, no, no!
That's simply impossible!

505
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,830
Well, bless him for trying.

506
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,450
Things I don't want to see
right now - number one, him.

507
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,310
So er... I won, then.

508
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:06,950
-Yes, but your car
doesn't have a drift button.
-A what?

509
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,330
-A drift button.
-What does that do?

510
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,990
Well, you push it,
and then,

511
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:13,460
when you go round a corner,
the car drifts.

512
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,730
-Does it?
-Yeah.

513
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,720
You know, I'd love
to see that in action.

514
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,530
-I'd love to see
you doing that.
-Yes.

515
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,040
-I'll watch. Yeah, show me.
-You stay there.

516
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,970
You will not... Even
James May could drift this.

517
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
-Here we go!
-I can't wait to watch.

518
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,240
JEREMY: Check it out,
ladies and gentlemen!

519
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,890
Check it out!

520
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,360
I'm drifting.

521
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,290
(LAUGHS) What do you think of
that, Hammond? Look at that!

522
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,900
Hammond?

523
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,910
Hammond?

524
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,610
Hammond!

525
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,180
(CHEERING)

526
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,190
What?
You're not gonna blame me.

527
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:12,090
-Where did you go?
-Well, I left you because
you were being moronic.

528
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,750
-I wasn't!
-You were!

529
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,090
Seriously,
who is going to buy

530
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,920
a Ford Focus when,
for the same money,

531
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,800
you could have
a V8-engine Mustang?

532
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,260
-No-one.
-What?

533
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:23,940
Nobody would. Mustang's
got so much more character.

534
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,390
Hang on.
So, you agree with me?

535
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,830
Oh, God, yes!
If I had the choice
of those two cars,

536
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:29,560
I'd have the Mustang
every day of the week.

537
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,940
So you ruined my day out
for no reason at all?

538
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:38,280
I ruined your day out
because it was fun...
to ruin your day out.

539
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,610
-Good work.
-It was good work.
Sorry about that.

540
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:45,020
But anyway, we must now
find out how fast those Fords
go round our track,

541
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:50,250
and that, of course, means
handing them over to our
other resident American -

542
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,960
a man who thinks that shower
gel is basically communist.

543
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,020
It's the American.

544
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,400
(REVVING)

545
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,690
JEREMY: There he is,
looking bewildered.

546
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,510
And he's away!

547
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:06,410
It sounds like a bunch
of goddamn mice in there.

548
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,350
Why the hell don't they just
start with eight cylinders?

549
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:17,540
Strangest mice I ever heard,
as he powers down the Isn't.

550
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,460
That is a good noise.

551
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,660
Arms working the wheel
like he's wrestling
a drifter,

552
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,150
which, of course, he is.

553
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,320
And already he's at
Your Name Here.

554
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:29,120
Tyres squealing,
but it's clinging on well,

555
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,340
and now the climb
back onto the Isn't.

556
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,200
It ain't got no room in it.

557
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,630
No place to put your beer.

558
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,830
I think he and I
look for slightly different
things in a car.

559
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,110
Anyway,
now hard on the brakes

560
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,750
as he turns into
Old Lady's House.

561
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,580
Yeah, he is dispatching that
with no dramas,

562
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,660
and now he can get
the hammer down

563
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,990
for the bumpy sprint
to Substation.

564
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,520
Looking good.

565
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,630
Four-wheel-drive cars can,
of course, understeer,

566
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,960
but... nope,
not a whiff of it here.

567
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:04,940
And Field Of Sheep,
tidy through there as well,

568
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,490
and across the line.

569
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:11,140
Now, I think
he might enjoy this one.

570
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,700
And he is
wheel-spinning away!

571
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,340
All right!
American muscle, baby!

572
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,340
5.0 Mustang -
this thing is badass.

573
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,480
It's got a trunk,
a place for my golf clubs.

574
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,120
Pack up the old lady,
go for the weekend
somewhere in this thing,

575
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,520
and you can haul ass
while you're goin'.

576
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,260
Something there about an old
lady and hauling a bottom.

577
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,540
Anyway, he's on the Isn't,

578
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,140
and he's flying into
Your Name Here.

579
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,470
The mighty Mustang has filled
the American with vigour,

580
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,480
and he's being
surprisingly tidy.

581
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,550
That's what us Americans
want, we want to
smoke the tyres.

582
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:57,180
We want this thing
to just get shit and get.

583
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,860
Literally no idea what he's
on about. It's just a noise.

584
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,100
When this thing stops, man,
it stops on a dime.

585
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,850
"It'll stop on a dime
and give you nine cents
change" is what we say.

586
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,100
You really can't shut him up
about this one.

587
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,770
Anyway, he is keeping it neat
round Old Lady's House,

588
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,230
and then unleashing
that V8 fury

589
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,770
over the rough stuff
to Substation.

590
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,380
Hard on the brakes,
ready for the 90 left.

591
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,540
Blip it up to Field Of Sheep.

592
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,940
Here we go.

593
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:31,110
Flurry of exuberance,
and across the line.

594
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,790
-(CHEERING)
-There we are.

595
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,630
OK, here's the Lap Board.

596
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,930
Let's have a look, first of
all, where the Focus went.

597
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,690
So...

598
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,160
Oh, there it is.

599
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,630
Faster than an ST200 -
perhaps not surprising.

600
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,610
Just as well.

601
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,980
Now let's bring up
the Mustang.

602
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,440
-Oh!
-(AUDIENCE GASPS)

603
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:58,540
-That's not embarrassing,
is it?
-(LAUGHTER)

604
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:02,610
The car that you, me,
and the American all prefer

605
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,910
is quite a lot slower
than the European Focus.

606
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,210
RICHARD: Yes.

607
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,060
Anyway, listen,
let's move on, shall we,

608
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,600
to Celebrity Brain Crash.

609
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,170
(CHEERING)

610
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,970
Now...

611
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:25,270
our guest this week
isn't just my favourite
Formula One driver,

612
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,540
he's also a local boy.

613
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:31,680
Oh, yeah, this is
the chatty man of motorsport,

614
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,910
Mr Effervescent,

615
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,650
ladies and gentlemen,
Kimi Räikkönen!

616
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,040
(CHEERING)

617
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,580
Here he comes.

618
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,050
RICHARD:
What are we gonna ask him?

619
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,800
It doesn't matter
what you ask him.

620
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:48,600
It doesn't, because you won't
get a coherent answer.

621
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,520
Is he all right?

622
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,470
JEREMY: No, hang on. Whoa!

623
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,500
RICHARD: Oh, no.
JEREMY: Not again.

624
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,210
(LAUGHTER)

625
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,600
No, he has, I'm afraid,
ladies and gentlemen,

626
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:03,000
literally drunk himself
to death.

627
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,000
(LAUGHTER)

628
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,520
JEREMY: Damn.

629
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,220
-Does that mean
he's not coming on, then?
-(LAUGHTER)

630
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,410
Well, his liver has failed

631
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,910
and he's now
slowly solidifying

632
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,920
in the freezing dusk of an
Arctic night, so that's a no.

633
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,030
(LAUGHTER)

634
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,360
Yeah, but it doesn't matter.

635
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,350
Well, it does, cos I actually
rather liked Kimi.

636
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,670
But I can think of something
else we can do to fill the time.

637
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,240
Here's the thing.
Er... If you're watching this

638
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,870
on the day the programme
is actually released,

639
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,500
it is December 23rd.

640
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,780
There are two days to go
until Christmas,

641
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:37,280
and if you're a man,
you won't have done
any shopping yet.

642
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,770
(LAUGHTER)

643
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,910
-But don't worry,
cos we've got your back.
-Oh, yeah.

644
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,320
We have trawled the Internet
and the shops

645
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,010
to find the best gift ideas.

646
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,520
Yes, and here, in our special
Grand Tour Santa Land Grotto.

647
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,590
-Yeah.
-(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

648
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,000
Nice view. Nice everything.

649
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,260
Yeah. Er...

650
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:00,270
We begin with this
rather brilliant tray,

651
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:04,310
which, apparently, is
the ideal place to put your
laptop or your breakfast.

652
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,330
We have a picture of it
in action here.

653
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,510
(LAUGHTER)

654
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,670
RICHARD: Hang on a minute!
-I see a couple of problems
with that.

655
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,610
RICHARD: I can too.
-What else have we got?

656
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,420
Well, now, the reason
I don't play chess any more

657
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,150
is it's just so exhausting
to move the pieces around.

658
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:22,530
-I know what you mean.
-Far too heavy, picking the
Queen up and moving her.

659
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:26,760
But it's OK, because Ferrari
has answered that problem
with this.

660
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:30,470
-It's a lightweight,
carbon-fibre chess set...
-(LAUGHTER)

661
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,470
...and it's yours for £1,400.

662
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:37,160
-How much?!
-£1,400.

663
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,870
And that is the funny thing -
you take something ordinary,

664
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,310
write a car name on it,
and suddenly
it becomes expensive.

665
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,920
This bear, for example.
I know about bears.

666
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,720
It's an acrylic fibre,

667
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,740
stuffed with
industrial waste.

668
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,920
£2.75.

669
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:56,050
But, because it's got
a Honda T-shirt on, £10.

670
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,180
-(LAUGHTER)
-£10.

671
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,120
Yes, but it's Honda Bear!

672
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,420
-Or...
-(LAUGHTER)

673
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,460
I love that! On Christmas
morning, Honda Bear!

674
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,640
I love following
his adventures!

675
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,840
How about this
lovingly crafted

676
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,110
"I love my Hyundai"
pillowcase?

677
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,340
(LAUGHTER)

678
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,600
What woman is ever
going to leap into bed

679
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,840
with a man whose pillows
bear that legend?

680
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,580
OK, Hammond, I'll tell you
exactly what woman.

681
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,510
The woman who would wear
this thong,

682
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,240
which has written
lovingly on the front,

683
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,110
the legend Elantra.

684
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,380
(LAUGHTER)

685
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,450
Erotic! Erotic!

686
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,660
Can I just say, the perfect
Christmas gift for the
Hyundai owner is a BMW.

687
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,800
Well, yes, look, we realised
that branding stuff,

688
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:42,360
obviously there's some money
in it, so we thought,
since we're in Scandinavia,

689
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,170
we would launch our
own range of car-branded
Christmas jumpers.

690
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,210
JEREMY: Mm-hm.
RICHARD: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

691
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,070
-Talk among yourselves,
everybody.
RICHARD: Hold on a moment.

692
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,680
JEREMY:
This is modelling time.

693
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,020
(CLEARS THROAT)
Mine is a simple turtleneck.

694
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,750
Very, very warm,
bearing the name of a legend
on the front.

695
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,820
I know, it's very special.
Very Christmassy, yeah?

696
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,460
-I have gone for
a very cuddly...
-(LAUGHTER)

697
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,770
...and Christmassy cardigan
bearing the name,

698
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,770
as you can see,
of a car I absolutely adore.

699
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,060
Yeah, and here's the thing,
OK.

700
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,430
Mine is a crewneck, actually.

701
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,830
(LAUGHTER)

702
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,410
(APPLAUSE)

703
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,770
Why is everybody...?

704
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,020
-Why are you applauding?
RICHARD: I don't know.

705
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,410
I think...

706
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,020
-Why are you...?
-Is it...?

707
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,080
Is it because they haven't
seen us in knitwear before?

708
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,750
(LAUGHTER)

709
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,590
Anyway, we've had a go
at making some
Grand Tour-branded stuff.

710
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,930
-Oh, yeah.
-But here's the thing.

711
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,260
We haven't gone for
the obvious stuff,

712
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,300
like jumpers
and mugs and umbrellas.

713
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,860
We've gone for things
that other people
haven't thought of.

714
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,230
Things like this -

715
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,460
haemorrhoid cream.

716
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,740
(LAUGHTER)

717
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,670
-We all need it.
-I don't.

718
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,250
No, I don't, either.

719
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,750
-Well, this is mine.
-(LAUGHTER)

720
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:01,120
Bought it for £2.75, but now
it's got Grand Tour on it,

721
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,020
we could sell that for £20.

722
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,010
I tell you what really good
idea we've had erm...

723
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:09,930
is condoms, OK,
which have been...

724
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,600
well, they've been branded
with well-known expressions

725
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,570
and phrases
that we often say.

726
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:17,000
-I'm gonna demonstrate
using this--
-Whoa!

727
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,090
(LAUGHTER)

728
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,590
You flatter yourself, sir!

729
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,010
-Au contraire.
-(LAUGHS) Oh, really?

730
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:27,110
So we simply roll the condom
over the rolling pin.

731
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,500
Here it is. There's
the GT logo coming up.

732
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,880
And on the other side,
"How hard can it be?"

733
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,480
-(LAUGHTER)
RICHARD: We're very pleased.

734
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:40,920
JEREMY: Pretty damn hard,
for a man of my age.

735
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,330
We're... We're very pleased
with these.

736
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,860
Various of our slogans
have been used. I'm going
to put mine on this er...

737
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,870
disappointingly small carrot.

738
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:49,900
(LAUGHTER)

739
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,560
Erm... And it bears
one of my expressions.

740
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,500
-See, I can't--
-Don't bite it!

741
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,530
Well, I can't open the thing,
can I?

742
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,360
No, there's one of those
little tear things.

743
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,270
-Hold on, love.
I'll be with you in a minute.
-(LAUGHTER)

744
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,880
-No, it's--
-You're not gonna be here
to help me when I'm using it!

745
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,510
-You don't know!
-I bloody do!

746
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,650
-I might be.
-I'm pretty sure
you won't be.

747
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,810
That's quite the wrong thing
to... Are you in?

748
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,680
-Yeah, I'm... What?!
-Can I have my glasses back?

749
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,220
-No.
-No, I want my glasses back

750
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,830
before you start messing
around with sex things.

751
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,130
Oh, right, let me...
Oh, dear. It's a bit baggy.

752
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,360
I've actually torn it
with my teeth,

753
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:25,440
which makes the slogan on it
quite appropriate, really -

754
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,060
"That's not gone well."

755
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,660
(LAUGHTER)

756
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,300
Can I just say, that is
by far and away

757
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,040
the least
erotic thing I have ever...

758
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,610
Don't tell me that's not
an unfamiliar sight.

759
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,880
Oh,
have you done one as well?

760
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:49,550
Of course I have.
Very sensibly,
I put mine on earlier.

761
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,430
-Whoa!
-(LAUGHTER)

762
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,200
Branded with the GT logo and
my own personal catchphrase,

763
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,760
"I was the first to arrive."

764
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,170
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

765
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:05,900
Now, are you bored
with having two
fully functioning ankles?

766
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,730
Yes?
Well, don't worry if you are,

767
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:10,650
because this Christmas,
the market is awash
with products

768
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,780
designed specifically
to break them.

769
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,540
such as this iBot-9.

770
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,140
I thought
that was a vacuum cleaner.

771
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,250
No, it's incredibly heavy

772
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,290
because it's
packed full of pain.

773
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,480
Basically, you put these
things out on the side,
you stand and whizz about.

774
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,660
But within seconds of getting
on, you will be falling over
and breaking your ankles.

775
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,030
Probably so.

776
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,790
Yes, and on the other hand,
there are also these.

777
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,290
These are called
the Rocket Skates.

778
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,830
They will cost you just £900,

779
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,400
and they are guaranteed
to power you
straight to casualty.

780
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,800
RICHARD: Yeah.

781
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,800
-No, they're fine.
JAMES: No,
they're really not.

782
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:46,640
-I'll be all right.
I could have a go on those.
-Who'd like to see that?

783
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,010
-(CHEERING)
-You said it.

784
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,010
Seriously.
I mean, honestly...

785
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,490
-"How hard can it be?"
-(LAUGHTER)

786
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,980
See, I knew it would
come in handy.
I can bludgeon...

787
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,100
-Seriously, I'll have a go.
-Off you go, mate.

788
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,770
-Yeah.
Can I wear my shoes in them?
-(IMITATES AMBULANCE SIREN)

789
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,970
-(LAUGHTER)
-Are they like ski boots?

790
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:08,290
RICHARD: Yes, Jeremy,
apart from they've got wheels
and you're indoors.

791
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:11,640
-I am not going near them.
-Just put my foot in them.

792
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,800
I don't want to!

793
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,840
-I can't see what I'm...
-It's degrading
and unpleasant.

794
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:21,720
-Do I take my shoes off?
-Put your great cloven hoof
in there.

795
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,180
It fits!
You can go to the ball.

796
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,960
-(LAUGHTER)
-There, you're in.

797
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,120
-Thank you.
-Now what are you gonna do?

798
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,530
You're not gonna do it!

799
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,990
(LAUGHTER)

800
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,060
-Is that it?
Have you started?
-Not yet.

801
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,130
I better face the other way,
hadn't I?

802
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,260
RICHARD: Looking good.

803
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,560
These are worth every...

804
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,740
What will they cost,
900 quid?

805
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,670
-Nine hundred quid.
-Literally every penny.

806
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,570
Wait, hold it there.
Hold it there.

807
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,180
Look out, girls,
Mr Darcy's arrived.

808
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,370
(LAUGHTER)

809
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,840
RICHARD: Looking good.

810
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:02,230
RICHARD:
Oh, this is brilliant.
JAMES: Wow!

811
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:06,230
I can see why they're called
Rocket Skates.

812
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,120
-Come on, man.
-(GROANS) Oh, God!
I'm trying to move!

813
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,890
WOMAN: Lean back!
-What do you mean,
"Lean back"?

814
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,470
(LAUGHTER)

815
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,930
Like that?

816
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,310
-Jeremy?
-What?

817
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,400
Stephen Hawking would make
a better job of these

818
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,910
Rocket Skates than you have.

819
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,310
-Right...
-Where are you going?!

820
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,150
-You've got to get one...
RICHARD: Do you remember...

821
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,360
-(SHOUTING)
RICHARD: Whoa!
It's a disaster!

822
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,630
(APPLAUSE)

823
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,020
JEREMY: Shit. Sorry.

824
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,590
Don't worry, Jeremy. I will
come and rescue on my...

825
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:42,800
Bloody hell!

826
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,730
-Oh, my God. It's going mad.
-(BEEPING)

827
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,400
Erm... Right. Right.

828
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,730
-I put my foot on there.
-This is a really good
ambulance service.

829
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,010
(LAUGHTER)

830
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,840
Yeah. Yeah. Don't worry,
I'll be there in a minute.

831
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:58,210
I don't know that this works.

832
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,780
-I've gone again!
-(LAUGHTER)

833
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:03,240
Shit! Now I've got cramp!

834
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,210
(YELLS)

835
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,180
That was...
That was a brilliant idea,
but never mind,

836
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,820
because erm...
I have a perfect
Christmas present here.

837
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:14,330
You control this
with your mobile phone
and your face comes on it.

838
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:16,620
And the brilliant thing
about it is that it means

839
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,760
you can have your favourite
celebrity round to your house
for Christmas lunch.

840
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:25,670
With that in mind, ladies and
gentlemen, would you please
welcome into the studio -

841
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:31,240
he's actually in his office
in London, and yet he's also
here on top of a stick -

842
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,780
it's Bob Geldof!

843
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,120
(CHEERING)

844
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,620
JEREMY:
We're gonna say hello to Bob.

845
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,150
RICHARD:
I can't say hello to Bob!
-He's coming, Hammond.

846
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,060
-I just go in circles!
-It is!

847
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,150
It's Bob Geldof, everybody!

848
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,450
Hello, Bob.
Where have you gone?

849
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,130
Bob! We're over here, Bob!

850
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,860
-Bob!
-Bob, we're over here!

851
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,700
-Where are you?
-He's there!

852
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,970
Bob Geldof, how are you?

853
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:57,000
Yes, happy Christmas!

854
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:59,580
Oh, (BLEEP)! Sorry!

855
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,250
-Are you having
a good Christmas, Bob?
-Oh, no! Bob's...

856
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:05,680
Ladies and gentlemen,
Bob Geldof is lost!

857
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,040
He's gone in the wrong...

858
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:10,080
JEREMY: Oh, James May's
coming to join in.

859
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:13,420
JAMES: I'm coming
to talk to Bob Geldof.

860
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,420
RICHARD: Whoa!
JEREMY: May has kissed
Bob Geldof!

861
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,000
-Hello, Bob. How are you?
-Get out of the way!

862
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,100
-I'm travelling!
-No, straight ahead, Bob.

863
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,430
Bob, no. Left-hand down, Bob.
No, Bob. Bob, you...

864
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,140
Have I just attacked
somebody's knob?

865
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,110
RICHARD: Bob,
stop attacking the crowd!

866
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:31,310
Now where's he going?!

867
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,400
Bob!

868
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,700
JAMES: Right,
I'll rescue Bob. Hold on.

869
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,370
Straight ahead, Bob.
That's perfect.

870
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,370
-Straight ahead. Straight.
A bit of right-hand down.
-(LAUGHTER)

871
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:45,420
No, don't drive into it!
Stop head-butting the tree!

872
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,050
This is ridiculous!

873
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,690
Where's the reindeers
and Santa Claus at?

874
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,450
-(AUDIENCE GASPS)
RICHARD: Oh, no!
Hang on a minute!

875
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,860
He's ruined Christmas!

876
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:57,000
Does he know
it's Christmas time at all?

877
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,260
Well, tonight, thank God
it's him instead of us

878
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:00,860
knocking the Christmas
tree over.

879
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:03,360
Absolutely right.
He's ruined it!

880
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:04,560
Anyway, erm...

881
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,910
(LAUGHTER)

882
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,470
This year marks
the 50th anniversary

883
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,180
of the greatest
battle in motorsport history.

884
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,340
The story begins
in the 1960s,

885
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:17,210
when Ford realised that they
could sell a lot more cars

886
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,310
if they were a lot more
successful on the racetrack.

887
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:25,530
So they formulated
a brilliant plan,
but unfortunately...

888
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,920
(LAUGHTER)

889
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,100
...it went disastrously
wrong, didn't it, Bob?

890
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:39,470
Ford knew that if you wanted
to rule in motorsport,

891
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,250
there was only one race
that mattered.

892
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:45,220
The toughest and most
dangerous of them all -

893
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,480
the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

894
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:50,620
REPORTER: Levegh's Mercedes
collides and blows up.

895
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,680
JAMES: The problem was,
for all its might,

896
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,350
Ford didn't have a clue
how to win at Le Mans.

897
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,050
However, over in Italy,
someone did.

898
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:09,530
In the early 1960s,

899
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,430
Enzo Ferrari's cars
ruled sports-car racing,

900
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,040
Le Mans especially.

901
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:16,410
At the start of the decade,

902
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:19,070
he had won the famous
and gruelling 24-hour race

903
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,510
three times on the trot.

904
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:25,690
However, the company was in
deep financial difficulty,

905
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,950
so when Ford offered to buy
the entire business,

906
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,980
Enzo agreed.

907
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,820
At first, all went well.

908
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,360
Enzo Ferrari and the head
of Ford, Henry Ford II,

909
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:44,660
quickly settled
on a price of $16 million.

910
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,810
And on May 21st 1963,

911
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:52,870
Ford executives arrived in
Maranello to sign the deal.

912
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,350
Ford turned up
with an army of suits.

913
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:57,280
Enzo Ferrari
sat opposite them

914
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:59,660
with just
the local town lawyer.

915
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,620
They read the contract
and all seemed well,

916
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,760
but then, suddenly,
Ferrari stopped

917
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,790
and he took out
his famous fountain pen
full of purple ink,

918
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,030
and as you can see from this
accurate copy I have here,

919
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,640
he drew a big exclamation
mark and he wrote,

920
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,040
"No, that's no good!"

921
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,100
Now, what had angered him?
Well, it was this clause
here.

922
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:21,010
You see, Enzo Ferrari
wanted to retain control

923
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:23,200
of the motorsport side
of his business,

924
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:28,010
but this bit effectively
handed control to Ford.

925
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,420
There followed
a tirade of abuse in Italian,

926
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,210
after which,
Enzo said to his lawyer,
"Let's go and eat."

927
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:38,830
Then they got up and they
simply walked out on the
stunned Ford executives.

928
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,030
That was that.

929
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:42,420
All of this for nothing.

930
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:46,700
Back in Detroit,
Henry Ford II,

931
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,490
apoplectic with rage,

932
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:51,440
gathered his lieutenants
and issued the order:

933
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,540
"Build me a car that will
crush Ferrari at Le Mans."

934
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,950
To beat Ferrari
on European soil,

935
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:03,350
Ford needed
European expertise,

936
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:05,750
so he hired a small
British motorsport company

937
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:09,290
that set up shop here,
in this very building,

938
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:13,320
on an industrial estate in
Slough, just outside London.

939
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,960
And the challenges
they faced were enormous.

940
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:21,190
They had to build a car that
would race at over 200mph,

941
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,070
which was something that had
never been done before,

942
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:27,440
and it had to be reliable
for the 24 hours
of the Le Mans race -

943
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:30,950
a race in which you
changed gear 9,000 times

944
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:34,680
and drove flat out
for 3,000 miles.

945
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:39,220
And, as if that wasn't
bad enough, they only had
ten months to do it.

946
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:47,630
Out of that insane timetable
emerged this.

947
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:51,190
The Ford GT.

948
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:55,630
Thanks to its sleek shape
and the body that stood
just 40-inches tall,

949
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,570
it promised to cut through
the air like a missile.

950
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,710
Add a 4.2L V8,

951
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:06,940
and the magic target
of 200mph seemed in the bag.

952
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:11,810
The trouble is, a racing car
is just a collection
of hopes and dreams

953
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,550
until it gets on the track.

954
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,390
And that's something
that Ford learned
in a very brutal way

955
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:22,170
when they took the GT40
to test at Le Mans
for the first time.

956
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:26,730
REPORTER: And so to the first
Le Mans practice session.

957
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,370
JAMES: On its first outing,
the renamed GT40 was fast,

958
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,180
but it was also
terrifyingly unstable,

959
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,250
spinning its wheels
on the straights.

960
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:39,320
I'm not talking about
when you set off,

961
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:42,750
I mean it was happening
at 170mph!

962
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:48,850
Now, the problem was either
aerodynamics or suspension,

963
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,260
but they never found out,

964
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:55,660
because, later that day,
the car crashed at 160mph.

965
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:58,500
Well, that was OK. They had
a spare one, of course.

966
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,060
The next day,
that crashed as well.

967
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:03,840
Le Mans
was just two months away.

968
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:13,610
Against all odds,
Ford got their act together
in time for the 1964 race.

969
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,750
REPORTER: The Le Mans
24 Hour Race at last,

970
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:19,410
and three gleaming Ford GTs
are present.

971
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,510
JAMES:
But during the race itself,

972
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:25,060
all the cars broke down
or caught fire,

973
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,120
leaving bitter rivals Ferrari

974
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:31,160
to take another
one-two-three victory.

975
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:38,160
In Detroit, Henry Ford
decreed that they would be
back next year

976
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,380
to take on Ferrari again.

977
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,280
And to head up the campaign,

978
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:45,670
he turned to
an American motorsport hero.

979
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,970
My name's Carroll Shelby and
performance is my business.

980
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:52,150
Shelby was a former
chicken farmer from Texas

981
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:55,660
who took nitroglycerin pills
to keep his heart going.

982
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,080
But he'd also racked up
countless victories

983
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,630
as a driver and team owner.

984
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,590
Given the task of turning
the GT40 into a winner,

985
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,960
he put his top man
on the job.

986
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:07,530
Coming up is Ken Miles,

987
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,240
one of the best
sport-car drivers in America.

988
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:15,710
Miles was a former
Second World War tank
commander from Birmingham -

989
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:18,600
the one in England,
not Alabama.

990
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,580
He was renowned
for speaking his mind

991
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:23,750
and developing racing cars.

992
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:25,510
Miles took the car
for a shakedown.

993
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,810
Then he got out
and he told Shelby
and the Ford executives,

994
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:30,490
"It's bloody awful!"

995
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,260
Then he got to work,

996
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:34,750
improving the brakes,
the engine,

997
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:36,800
the aerodynamics,
the handling,

998
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:41,860
and taming
the car's terrifying
high-speed instability.

999
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:44,960
However, and even though he
and his team took amphetamine

1000
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,840
so that they could
stay awake all night,

1001
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:51,870
there simply wasn't time
to develop the car properly
for Le Mans.

1002
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:54,270
The GT40
may have been faster,

1003
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:56,420
but it was still fragile.

1004
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,280
At the 1965 race,

1005
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:00,860
six cars started,
none finished,

1006
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,830
and the Italians
humiliated Ford once again.

1007
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,820
So, untold millions
of dollars had been spent

1008
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:13,430
since the first GT40 emerged
from this building here,

1009
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,610
and yet not one car
had even finished the race.

1010
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,380
So Ford now faced
a difficult choice -

1011
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,480
he could throw in the towel
against Ferrari,
or he could fight on.

1012
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,710
What he actually did was
he had some business cards
printed,

1013
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:29,320
and he distributed them
to his Le Mans team.

1014
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:32,460
And on the cards it said,
"You'd better win."

1015
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,090
And so, a year later,

1016
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,780
the American giant
returned to Le Mans

1017
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:40,890
with its hopes
resting on this.

1018
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,330
(ENGINE REVVING)

1019
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:49,900
OK, viewers,

1020
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:54,980
this is historic-race-car
bucket-list moment
number two,

1021
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,780
because this is
an actual GT40

1022
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,570
that competed at Le Mans
in 1966.

1023
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:07,350
All right, don't go mad, May,
it's worth 15-million quid.

1024
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:11,350
Sod it!
Let's make some noise!

1025
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:18,770
Oh, yes!

1026
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:23,070
In this new GT40,

1027
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:27,030
Ken Miles had racked up
thousands of test hours.

1028
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:30,570
Now the car was no longer
horribly unstable,

1029
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,970
but would sit rocksteady
at 210mph.

1030
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:39,990
And the Brummie tank
commander had the backing of
Ford's huge R&D department,

1031
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,750
who tackled the car's
appalling reliability.

1032
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:47,660
The brakes no longer went
into thermal shock

1033
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:50,070
at the end of
the long straight.

1034
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:54,000
The engine and transmission
were run on
a computerised test rig

1035
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:58,130
that simulated the whole of
the 24-Hour Le Mans race.

1036
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,770
Now, that's standard practice
in Formula One today,

1037
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,510
but in 1966
that was witchcraft.

1038
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:09,440
They weren't mucking about,
these blokes.

1039
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:12,140
But neither were
the opposition.

1040
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:15,430
Over in Italy, in response
to the new threat,

1041
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:17,860
Ferrari produced this.

1042
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:29,000
Called the P3,
it looked as sleek as a GT40.

1043
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:33,880
And at just 37.4 inches tall,
it was even lower.

1044
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,470
Avanti!

1045
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,760
Whoo! Holy mother!

1046
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:49,160
I best be a little bit
careful on this narrow road.

1047
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,960
It's worth £20 million.

1048
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:59,460
Where the GT40 boasted
a top speed of over 210mph,

1049
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,710
the P3 maxed out at just 190.

1050
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:08,880
But Enzo Ferrari was willing
to trade outright speed
for gains elsewhere.

1051
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,610
The Ferrari was lighter,
it was more agile.

1052
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:16,050
Ferrari reckoned
he could make up
the difference in the bends,

1053
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:19,480
and he wouldn't have to stop
so often for fuel.

1054
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:24,590
A David and Goliath battle
was looming.

1055
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:30,200
At the 1966 Le Mans race,
Ford arrived with an armada -

1056
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,490
eight cars,
20 tonnes of spares,

1057
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,900
and a squad
of world-class drivers,

1058
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,540
including Ken Miles himself.

1059
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:43,000
In comparison, Ferrari turned
up with just a trio of P3s,

1060
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:44,970
but Enzo had an ace
up his sleeve -

1061
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,710
the undisputed
fastest driver on the planet,

1062
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:53,290
Formula One World Champion
John Surtees.

1063
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:59,690
He came to me and said,
"John... we've got to beat
the Fords. Go out and do it."

1064
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,330
I thought
there was only one tactic -

1065
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:05,020
to have at least one car
be the hare.

1066
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:09,540
I said, "Look,
I don't mind being the hare."

1067
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:11,330
"The moment
that flag goes down,

1068
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,330
we need to be - bang - off,"

1069
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:18,200
tempting the Ford drivers
to perhaps overdrive
a little bit.

1070
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,220
If one could push them
hard enough for long enough,

1071
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,420
then there is more
likelihood, obviously,
of being able to break them.

1072
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,250
The plan was set.

1073
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:32,560
But, as zero hour approached,
everything unravelled.

1074
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,790
REPORTER: Shortly before
the race, we learned that
he wasn't going to drive,

1075
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,590
and we asked him about it.

1076
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:41,360
Yes, unfortunately
you've heard correct.
I won't be driving.

1077
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:43,430
REPORTER: What is the reason?

1078
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:46,580
Well, I suppose it's best
summed up at this stage

1079
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,100
by saying
"political reasons."

1080
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:51,440
JAMES: The problem was that
the Ferrari team manager

1081
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,850
was playing
his own political game.

1082
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,310
He had no particular liking
for Surtees,

1083
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,940
and he nominated
another driver

1084
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:01,060
to go out and start the race,
to be the hare,

1085
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:06,700
even though Surtees
was clearly
the fastest man available.

1086
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,300
SURTEES: And I just stormed
away, drove back, and
had it out with the old man.

1087
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,590
As the Italian papers put it,

1088
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,700
they showed a picture
of me walking out the gates
and saying,

1089
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:22,610
"The divorce of John Surtees
and Enzo."

1090
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,880
With Surtees out of the way,

1091
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,110
the Fords took the top four
slots in qualifying.

1092
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:34,610
And as the clock ticked down,
Henry Ford II
prepared to drop the flag,

1093
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:40,530
praying that, this time,
he would get his revenge.

1094
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:44,300
REPORTER:
Live from Le Mans, France,
it's the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

1095
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:47,160
(CROWD CHEERING)

1096
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:59,650
At first, the Fords
stormed into the lead.

1097
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,520
But a few hours in,

1098
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:07,660
it was beginning to look like
a depressing repeat
of '64 and '65.

1099
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,480
As night fell, the Ferraris,
using their greater agility

1100
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:12,450
and their greater
fuel efficiency,

1101
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,550
were leading the race
one-two.

1102
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:20,670
Four of the eight GT40s were
out of the race altogether.

1103
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:25,710
Worse still, the Ford drivers
had strict orders
not to go balls-out

1104
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:29,170
for fear
of breaking the cars.

1105
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,310
But one man wasn't listening
to those orders.

1106
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,250
Ken Miles
put the hammer down,

1107
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:37,910
set blistering lap times,
and retook the lead for Ford.

1108
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:42,690
The Ferraris had no response
to this crushing pace,

1109
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:46,900
and by morning,
they had either
broken down or crashed.

1110
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:51,800
That afternoon, Henry Ford
watched his cars cruise home

1111
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:55,190
to a spectacular
one-two-three finish.

1112
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,370
REPORTER: First place
for the Ford GT Mk II,

1113
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,550
and a first-time win
for America at Le Mans.

1114
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:10,710
JAMES: Ford would go on
to win their next four
Le Mans races.

1115
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,890
But the man
who had contributed
so much to the team

1116
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,020
didn't get to see
these triumphs.

1117
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:19,730
Ken Miles was killed two
months after their first win,

1118
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,430
testing the latest GT40.

1119
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:28,340
It's impossible to calculate
how much Henry Ford spent

1120
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,010
on his three-year campaign
to break Ferrari,

1121
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:33,310
but experts reckon that,
at the very least,

1122
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:38,800
in today's money,
it was £360 million.

1123
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,750
Now, that's a big bill
for settling a spat
with an angry Italian.

1124
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:47,290
But look what
we got out of it -

1125
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,980
one of the world's
greatest cars.

1126
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,960
(CHEERING)

1127
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,500
RICHARD: Very good.

1128
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,460
That was good. Very good.

1129
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,240
-I hate you.
-I know.

1130
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:14,250
No, but I really hate you
now, cos you've driven a
Ford GT40, and I never have.

1131
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,940
I mean, next week
are you gonna lick
Helena Christensen?

1132
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:18,480
-(LAUGHTER)
-Look...

1133
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:21,920
I'm sure you could drive a
GT40 if you really wanted to.

1134
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:23,490
I can't, I'm too tall.

1135
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:25,380
Yeah, you mean fat.

01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:26,860
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

1137
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,310
-Tall.
-(LAUGHTER)

1138
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:39,140
Horizontally tall.

01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,540
Well, listen, whatever
dimension is the problem,

1141
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:44,150
I can't drive one.

1142
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:47,150
And on that terrible
disappointment,
it is time to end.

1143
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,710
