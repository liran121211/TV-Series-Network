It was morning by the time I nursed
my wounded car into Windhoek,

35

and my well-rested colleagues
were full of admiration

36
00:02:05,315 --> 00:02:08,170
for how I'd pulled off
such a feat.

37
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:10,975
- Is that the first thing you thought of?
- What?

38
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,279
Tear a hole in it.
What's that gonna do?

39
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:17,022
I needed to get to the bleed valve

Oh! I was trying to fix it. And the
only eye I can close is this eye.

- Have you got tenting equipment of any sort?

Have you got somewhere to sleep
other than the desert floor? No.

big leg of the journey?

- Mm.

we headed out to get
the necessary supplies.

66
00:03:31,908 --> 00:03:34,322
The thing is, if we go mesh,

67
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:37,251
it'll keep the sun off but
it won't keep the light out.

68
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,189
That will wake us up early.
That's 1.5 kilograms. But...

69

Hammond, the first thing you need to
know before we start shopping in here

70
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:46,345
is... James and I are in charge.

71
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,095
- Well...
- Sorry, he's right.

72
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,595
No, you're not. You don't
know anything about camping.

73
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,969
- JAMES, JEREMY: Exactly.
- How does that make you in charge?

74
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:54,611
Because we know
it's all terrible.

75
00:03:54,665 --> 00:03:58,314
If we leave it to you, we'll all end
up sleeping in small green triangles.

76
00:03:58,415 --> 00:04:00,665
The camping you know about
is in the Lake District,

77
00:04:00,712 --> 00:04:03,454
where you deliberately
make yourself miserable.

78
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:04,626
I'm sorry, he's right.

79
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:06,931
It is possible, I think,

80
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,845
with a bit of ingenuity
and money,

81
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:12,142
to make tenting bearable.

82
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,923
Richard Baden-Hammond
disagreed,

83
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:18,759
so we went our separate ways.

84
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:21,064
Correct, incorrect.

85
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:22,179
- Exactly.
- Do you agree?

86
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:24,634
- But I'd go even more correct.
- Oh, yes!

87
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,618
Perfect. Roll it out
on the desert floor...

88
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:30,518

Oh, James! Le Creuset!

90
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:36,275
See, Hammond would hate this, because
this weighs more than a tent.

91
00:04:36,321 --> 00:04:38,460
- Which it does, actually.
- A lot more.

92
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:41,895
- And it weighs more because it is a quality item.
- Exactly.

93
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:44,038
Pocket trowel.

94
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:45,772
Pocket soap.

- Pasta spoon.
- Yeah, good idea.

97
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:53,605
I find that bottle opener
a bit... lightweight.

98
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:55,847
Yeah, more expensive
is what we're looking for.

99
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,183
You see, look at this, James.

100
00:04:57,248 --> 00:05:00,496
This is the sort of thing
Hammond would think is a chair.

101
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:05,316
Ooh! That's all you need.
That's your whole... stove.

102

That's it.

103
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:08,938
- Is it gas? It is, isn't it?
- I presume so.

104
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:12,993
For two, you could get a small
chicken in there, or... a pheasant.

105
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,080
We're getting there now.

106
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,180
So that folds down to that.

107
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:23,901
Yeah.

109
00:05:26,739 --> 00:05:29,134
The next morning,
we headed out once more,

110
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:31,864
with the camping gear
James and I had bought

111
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:33,871
bringing up the rear.

112
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:39,900
And besides stocking up
with essentials,

113
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:46,144
Hammond and I had used our day off
in Windhoek to modify our cars.

114
00:05:46,254 --> 00:05:49,541
To solve my overheating problems,
I've fitted a ram-air scoop,

115
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:54,822
which... shovels refreshing, cooling air
into the radiator as I go along.

116
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,493
And, as you may have noticed,
I've fitted a spoiler.

117
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,055
My only complaint, really,
about my beach buggy

118
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,250
was its lack of performance
in third and fourth gears.

119
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,469
Couldn't up power from the engine
and I don't want to stress it,

120
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,188
so I could lighten it.

121
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:16,125
I've stripped away the superstructure
here and the passenger seat,

122
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,579
anything spare.

123
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:23,470
That means this car is 30-40 kilos
lighter than it was before.

124
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:28,454
Jeremy, why has your car
sprouted a green moustache?

125
00:06:28,711 --> 00:06:32,491
Well, it's a spoiler for added
downforce at the front end,

126
00:06:32,618 --> 00:06:35,235
which you need
in a rear-engine vehicle.

127
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:38,274
This thing will be unbelievable
through the corners now,

128
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:39,342
it really will.

129
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,102
Like a 911.

130
00:06:41,645 --> 00:06:42,946
And I tell you what,

131
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:45,188
even with your new
lightweight buggy,

132
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:48,672
you're no match for what
I've got here this morning.

133
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:51,399
Yeah, I'm sorry, mate.
This is quicker.

134
00:06:51,565 --> 00:06:54,094
- It is not.
- It is.

135
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,524
Right, Richard Hammond,
I challenge you to a race.

136
00:06:57,735 --> 00:07:00,094
OK, you're on. Idiot.

137
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:03,077
<i>We shall find a race
track and we shall do racing.</i>

138
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,719
Well, you carry on.
I'm not doing any racing.

139
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:07,719
That's utterly pointless.

140
00:07:09,688 --> 00:07:11,313
On the outskirts of the city,

141
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,496
we found a rather
excellent circuit

142
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,782
where we could do timed laps,

143
00:07:15,864 --> 00:07:19,813
and James could try out
his new vacuum cleaner.

144
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:21,868
Oh, yes.

145
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:25,969
- Are you ready?
- No.

146
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,676
- Why not?
- Temperatures and pressures.

147
00:07:28,977 --> 00:07:31,352
This is a racing machine.
Look at it.

148
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:33,797
It's a plastic beach buggy
parked near a V8.

149
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:35,875
- With aero.
- Really?

150
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,117
In...

151
00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:40,344
three, two, one, go!

152
00:07:41,907 --> 00:07:43,477
Yeah, I'm gonna do it in gear.

153
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,325
- Give it a shot.
- I'm gonna try that.

154
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:47,750
- In...
- No! Throttle's jammed.

155
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:49,889
Yes.

156
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:51,570
- Jammed.
- In...

157
00:07:51,602 --> 00:07:53,569
No! You can keep saying "in"

158
00:07:53,652 --> 00:07:56,037
till the cows come home.
The throttle...

159
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,873
Three, two, one, begin!

160
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:12,447
Why... Why have you stopped?

161
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:14,116
Ah. Well, erm...

162
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:18,194
The throttle
may have gone a bit open.

163
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:21,619
Yeah.

164
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:24,217
My throttle is totally broken.

165
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:25,936
- Anyway, Hammond...
- Yeah?

166
00:08:25,998 --> 00:08:29,327
Any car which can wheelie
off the line...

167
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,702
is going to be able to beat
yours, and would have done.

168
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:32,834
So... Sorry.

169
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:34,997
You're saying
because your car started,

170
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,927
- well, 50 yards away over there
- Yeah!

171
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:38,974
Wheelied, was uncontrollable,
slammed back down

172
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:41,607
and broke itself,
it's the best on the track?

173

Oh, look, there's rhinos!
There's actual rhinos!

243
00:12:21,612 --> 00:12:23,703
And they've been dehorned.

244
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,220
They've had to take its horn out

245
00:12:25,298 --> 00:12:27,877
to stop poachers shooting it.

246
00:12:28,073 --> 00:12:30,159
But you know what
the poachers are doing?

247
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:31,752
They shoot the dehorned ones,

248
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:34,882
because if they track for
a couple of days, a rhino,

249
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:37,002
and then it's got no horn,
they shoot it,

250
00:12:37,073 --> 00:12:40,220
and then they'll never track
it again, so it saves time.

251
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:43,252
Do you know how much you get
for a rhino horn now?

- On the... On the market?
- Yeah, in Vietnam.

254
00:12:47,104 --> 00:12:50,065
$320,000.

255
00:12:50,463 --> 00:12:52,651

going down into its nose.

I'd like to stop poachers,

346
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,144
but... out here at night, what
is the poacher-to-lion ratio?

347
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,677
What am I more likely to find?

348
00:17:36,115 --> 00:17:39,458
What you have to do
is look for rhino tracks,

349
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:42,794
cos that's what the poachers
will be following.

350
00:17:57,771 --> 00:18:01,013
Literally the most manly
thing I've ever done.

351
00:18:01,357 --> 00:18:04,701
Grand Tour for men,
splashing all over.

352
00:18:04,702 --> 00:18:05,554
Ow!

353
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:08,882
- Bloody hell!
- You stupid bastards!

354
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:11,050
Someone's shot me!

355
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:13,411
Hammond? Hammond?

356
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:14,716
Hammond?

357
00:18:14,771 --> 00:18:16,615
Clarkson, you moron.

358
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:18,255
Hammond?

359
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:30,372
Right, well,
I have to be honest,

360
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,872
yesterday was
a total waste of time.

361
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:34,763
We achieved nothing.

362
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:38,607
All we did achieve was we seem
to have wounded Mr Hammond,

363
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:42,146
who er... well, we couldn't wake
him up this morning at all.

364
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:45,074
And because we needed to get
going, we've a long way to go,

365
00:18:45,132 --> 00:18:46,956
we've had to improvise.

366
00:18:57,111 --> 00:18:59,706
Aaargh!

367
00:19:00,316 --> 00:19:01,425
Oh!

368
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:03,731
What the?

369
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,865
What the is this?

370
00:19:07,297 --> 00:19:09,144
You bastards!

371
00:19:13,941 --> 00:19:15,027
Back on the ground,

372
00:19:15,144 --> 00:19:18,285
James and I had
our own problems.

373
00:19:19,378 --> 00:19:21,198
Oh, God!

374
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:24,128
Ow! Ow!

375
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:30,378
This is very good
for the gravel rash

376
00:19:30,425 --> 00:19:34,089
that I got... during my
parachute accident yesterday.

377
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:36,135
Oh, that hurts.

378
00:19:39,152 --> 00:19:41,348
What we could really do with
is a rain shower

379
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,762
to dampen this dust down.

380
00:19:43,863 --> 00:19:45,918
I think it's unlikely.

381
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,660
Yeah, there's no evidence that
rain is on its way, I would say.

382
00:19:51,535 --> 00:19:53,668
Soon, word came over the radio

383
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:57,082
that Hammond was on his way
to rejoin us...

384
00:19:58,184 --> 00:20:01,369
and that he wasn't
in the best of moods.

385
00:20:01,428 --> 00:20:04,159
What was that?

386
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:07,275
What was that about?

387
00:20:07,448 --> 00:20:09,923
- We didn't want to leave you behind.
- You wouldn't wake up.

388
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:11,805
No, obviously, you didn't
want to leave me behind,

389
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:13,415
so you did the logical thing,

390
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:15,939
which is suspend me from
a helicopter whilst asleep.

391
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:18,869
- Yes.
- Most people would arrive at the same conclusion.

392
00:20:18,908 --> 00:20:20,614
No, you didn't!
You were having a laugh!

393
00:20:20,665 --> 00:20:22,796
Do you realise how rough
the first road was

394
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:24,369
that you haven't had
to drive on?

395
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:26,900
And you got a helicopter
ride, which we haven't had.

396
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,126
You wouldn't be laughing
and sniggering so much

397
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:31,626
if I'd fallen out of that
thing, as I could have done.

398
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,290
Well, it wouldn't be funny.

399
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:35,470
No, it just wouldn't be
interesting.

401

With the rhino fiasco behind us,

402
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:45,470
we got back to
the job in hand...

403
00:20:46,742 --> 00:20:48,908
which was to reach
the Angolan border,

404
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:51,095
and therefore prove that
beach buggies

405
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,314
are brilliant
go-anywhere machines

406
00:20:53,388 --> 00:20:56,033
and not just frivolous toys.

407
00:20:58,204 --> 00:21:02,689

Ow! Christ on a bike!

I hate to admit this,
but I'm jealous of Hammond.

413
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,979
I wish I'd fitted
that suspension on my car.

414
00:21:29,494 --> 00:21:34,690
How is this car gonna stand up
to this punishment all day?

415
00:21:36,374 --> 00:21:38,906
Well, since it had been
designed by me

416
00:21:38,937 --> 00:21:41,492
and made from
40-year-old components,

417
00:21:41,595 --> 00:21:44,331
the answer
was depressingly predictable.

418
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:50,317
The alternator, as you can
see, has come off its hinge.

419
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:53,307
The bolt's supposed to go in
there and it's just come off.

420
00:21:53,423 --> 00:21:57,549
And the bolt, well, that's
somewhere back there, 100 miles.

421
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:07,549
So, my alternator is now
held on with a screwdriver

422
00:22:07,604 --> 00:22:09,955
that I've hammered into place.

423
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:12,533
And we're running well.

424
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:19,713
Oh. I don't know what
I'm gonna do about it,

425
00:22:19,853 --> 00:22:22,518
but I don't have
a fan belt on there.

426
00:22:25,138 --> 00:22:27,455
I've got a problem.

427
00:22:28,588 --> 00:22:32,268
Another five miles,
another fan belt.

428
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:34,799
I'm gonna need a pair of tights.

429
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:38,659
And it wasn't just me.

that, the ignition cut-out switch.

I've got some weird gremlin.

This road is just
shaking these cars to pieces.

433
00:22:50,797 --> 00:22:53,556
Naturally, Jeremy
decided that the only way

434
00:22:53,595 --> 00:22:55,542
of keeping his car in one piece

435
00:22:55,611 --> 00:22:57,932
was to drive very quickly.

436
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:02,674
My optimum speed is 2,800 rpm,

437
00:23:02,854 --> 00:23:04,839
that being my only dial, really.

438
00:23:04,963 --> 00:23:08,065
That way, I'm skipping
over the top of the ridges.

439
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,292
Unfortunately, at this speed,

440
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:13,815
my V8 was emptying
the petrol tank

441
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,456
every 31 miles.

442
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,987
And one of the items we'd forgotten
to buy at the camping shop

443
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:21,828
was a funnel.

444
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,836
Right, wind's dropped.
Here we go.

00:23:25,145 --> 00:23:26,424

This is completely safe.

Some of the petrol is...
Oh, my giddy aunt!

448
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:39,979

00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:48,611
What is this Star Trek special
effect we've arrived in?

520
00:27:50,163 --> 00:27:51,830
Oh, my God!

521
00:27:54,377 --> 00:27:57,713
I am swimming through dust.
I'm actually swimming in it.

522
00:27:59,838 --> 00:28:01,798
Oh, dear, oh, dear!

523
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:04,863
We had driven into
something called fesh fesh,

524
00:28:05,135 --> 00:28:07,682
a sand as fine as talcum powder.

525
00:28:07,814 --> 00:28:09,783
Oh, shite!

526
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:13,994
And this had made Ali G
even more cross.

527
00:28:16,273 --> 00:28:18,792
I can't see a bloody thing
now. I've got to...

528
00:28:18,945 --> 00:28:22,375
I can't even find James May
to kill him.

529
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:26,055
Oh! Oh!

530
00:28:26,742 --> 00:28:30,169
OK, the engine's boiling
and I'm stuck.

531
00:28:30,562 --> 00:28:32,156
All my electrics
have gone haywire

532
00:28:32,181 --> 00:28:35,305
My... It's still trying to turn the
motor over. The battery's dead.

533
00:28:35,406 --> 00:28:37,067
Are you stuck, James?

534
00:28:37,187 --> 00:28:39,012
Er...

535
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,977
I think I'm stuck.

536
00:28:43,203 --> 00:28:44,717
Well done, James.

537
00:28:44,838 --> 00:28:46,560
Improved our lot no end.

538
00:28:46,742 --> 00:28:48,570
So the situation is...

539
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:51,117
Hammond has broken his car,
you're stuck,

540
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,234
and mine's overheated.

541
00:28:53,422 --> 00:28:57,375
Are we going to say, James,
that your idea was stupid?

542
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,859
It was stupid.

543
00:29:03,602 --> 00:29:06,263
With even Sergeant Stubborn
admitting defeat,

544
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,818
it was time
to throw in the towel.

545
00:29:08,904 --> 00:29:12,579
So we got ourselves sorted
out, got a wash in the river

546
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,115
and headed back to the road.

547
00:29:16,684 --> 00:29:19,606
There you go.
Freshly ironed linen shirt

548
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:23,794
with epaulettes
that matches my beach buggy.

549
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:25,794
Ironed by Giovanni.

550
00:29:28,716 --> 00:29:30,029
Despite everything,

551
00:29:30,096 --> 00:29:33,763
our beach buggies
had covered 750 miles

552
00:29:33,865 --> 00:29:36,005
of our 1,000-mile journey,

553
00:29:36,115 --> 00:29:38,537
and we were now well
into the tribal regions

554
00:29:38,604 --> 00:29:40,786
of northern Namibia...

555
00:29:42,391 --> 00:29:45,075
which is
picture-book Africa.

556
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:49,875
Well, this is all a bit too
beautiful for words along here.

557
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,685
Look at this.

558
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:54,825
Tribal Namibia, I like it.

559
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:04,654
Where we are now,
it's genuinely...

560
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:08,240
Well, what would you say,
"unspoiled"? Yeah.

561
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:10,865
People do live... the lives

562
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:13,294
they've led here
for thousands of years.

563
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:17,427
Oh, no!

564
00:30:17,521 --> 00:30:19,880
Oh, no! I'm dying!

565
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,841
Annoyingly,
the James May excursion

566
00:30:23,911 --> 00:30:26,911
had caused more damage
than I'd realised.

567
00:30:27,622 --> 00:30:30,458
Oh, now this is stuck on.

568
00:30:30,794 --> 00:30:31,880
Oh, bugger.

569
00:30:31,927 --> 00:30:34,935
Then, instead of the
breakdown-recovery service,

570
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:37,570
some topless ladies arrived...

571
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,642
Hello.

572
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:44,538
Which made knowing where
to look a bit difficult.

573
00:30:44,865 --> 00:30:46,130
Oh!

574
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,779
Erm... Concentrate
on the job, Richard.

575
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,482
This is unusual.

576
00:30:56,704 --> 00:30:59,169
I mean, normally
the AA would have done.

577
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:02,263
Thank you!

578
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:04,985
Very good.

579
00:31:05,654 --> 00:31:08,457
Oh, there's more.

580
00:31:14,802 --> 00:31:19,280
I, too, was nursing wounds
as a result of May Tours.

581
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,505
I do seem to have lost...

582
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:24,427
one of my cylinders somehow.

583
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:26,314
I'm driving a V7.

584
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:31,771
Basically, this is now
Spitty Spitty Bang Bang.

585
00:31:32,193 --> 00:31:34,911
So, at the lunch stop,
Richard and I decided

586
00:31:34,988 --> 00:31:37,872
to get our revenge on Mr May.

587
00:31:47,216 --> 00:31:48,888
Clarkson!

588
00:31:48,943 --> 00:31:50,146
What?

589
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,755
You've put... Where's...

590
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:54,173
That is disturbing.

591
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:56,044
What's annoying is,
what have you done

592
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:58,232
with my original
vintage VW gear knob?

593
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,379
Ah, well, no, good news on that.

594
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:02,740
Giovanni has posted
your original gear lever

595
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:04,200
back to your address in London.

596
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:06,138
- Has he?
- Special delivery.

597
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,646
What is the matter with you?
That's really offensive.

598
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:11,872
Well, I think that's
a bit sexist.

599
00:32:11,982 --> 00:32:14,740
No, it's not. Why would I want
to drive with a rubber penis?

600
00:32:14,773 --> 00:32:16,842
I don't know.
I think you're weird.

601
00:32:22,591 --> 00:32:26,544
With our break over,
we got back on the road.

602
00:32:27,091 --> 00:32:30,591
For our American viewers, James
May is driving a dick-shift.

603
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,747
And it wasn't just James's knob

604
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,521
that was keeping us amused.

605
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:39,654
There was something else
we'd learned over lunch

606
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,963
that was even funnier.

607
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:45,822
James May's fuel tank has
a hole in it, or it's split.

608
00:32:46,135 --> 00:32:48,354
He's driving a bomb.

609
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,041
It's a tense moment, this.

610
00:32:52,111 --> 00:32:54,947
It's like the end of a
football match when it's 1-1.

611
00:32:55,088 --> 00:32:57,377
You're driving along,
you know he's gonna blow up,

612
00:32:57,432 --> 00:32:59,604
you just don't know when.

613
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,557
It's not gonna
read well in the papers.

614
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:06,026
"James May died in an exploding beach
buggy, holding a rubber penis."

615
00:33:06,682 --> 00:33:08,589
Oh, shut up!

616
00:33:08,723 --> 00:33:09,824
Jeez!

617
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:17,394
Oh! In the face!

618
00:33:21,111 --> 00:33:23,721
Once James's
fuel tank had run low enough,

619
00:33:23,854 --> 00:33:25,893
we pulled over
in a small village

620
00:33:25,992 --> 00:33:28,294
so he could make some repairs.

621
00:33:31,252 --> 00:33:34,994
Well, the wind's blowing that way,
so the fireball will go up there.

622
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:37,268
It'll be sudden, won't it,
when he goes?

623
00:33:37,354 --> 00:33:38,177
Yeah. It's "woompf."

624
00:33:38,244 --> 00:33:39,444
"Woompf," then a bit of quiet,

625
00:33:39,478 --> 00:33:41,147
and then...
as all bits come down.

626
00:33:41,214 --> 00:33:42,881
Yes.

627
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:45,627
Here's the split in the tank.

628
00:33:45,885 --> 00:33:48,533
- Apply this.
- Oh, hello!

629
00:33:48,713 --> 00:33:50,994
You know we've been saying how
bad the roads are, Hammond?

630
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:52,135
Yes.

631
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:56,041
They're bad enough to kill
an un-killable car.

632
00:33:56,236 --> 00:33:57,956
That's kind of a terrifying
sight, isn't it?

633
00:33:58,018 --> 00:34:02,143
I know. I've never seen that
before in my life.

634
00:34:02,322 --> 00:34:04,838
A dead Toyota pickup truck.

635
00:34:06,608 --> 00:34:08,510
With James's tank bodged,

636
00:34:08,607 --> 00:34:12,158
we knuckled down to getting
some miles under our belt.

637
00:34:14,775 --> 00:34:16,236
And for the rest of the day,

638
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:20,168
the only person
with petrol issues was me.

639
00:34:25,262 --> 00:34:29,645
Right. Refuelled,
so I'm good now for 31 miles.

640
00:34:32,754 --> 00:34:35,348
By the end of the day,
we'd made good progress.

641
00:34:35,403 --> 00:34:37,422
And when we stopped
to make camp...

642
00:34:37,496 --> 00:34:40,197
Where the bloody hell's
Giovanni?

643
00:34:40,343 --> 00:34:43,814
We were less than 100
miles from the finish line.

644
00:34:43,923 --> 00:34:46,966
So, after supper, we decided
to have a conversation -

645
00:34:47,005 --> 00:34:48,130
well, argument -

646
00:34:48,216 --> 00:34:51,550
about who'd built
the best beach buggy.

647
00:34:51,617 --> 00:34:55,688
The point is,
yours isn't a beach buggy.

648
00:34:55,754 --> 00:34:57,022
- My car?
- Yeah.

649
00:34:57,089 --> 00:34:58,569
Apart from having
a beach buggy's body

650
00:34:58,624 --> 00:35:01,194
and the beating, pulsating
heart of a beach buggy,

651
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,779
namely a Beetle engine.

652
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:04,138
I look at yours and go,

653
00:35:04,216 --> 00:35:06,177
"That doesn't even look
like a beach buggy."

654
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:08,458
It does and it is!
It's a beach buggy.

655
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:10,359
Enhanced, but in the spirit
of beach buggying.

656
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:14,356
- It isn't.
- Jeremy, yours is... a freak.

657
00:35:14,473 --> 00:35:17,458
Had it existed 100 years ago,
it would have been exhibited.

658
00:35:17,552 --> 00:35:20,919
People would come from miles and children
would peak at it through curtains.

659
00:35:21,005 --> 00:35:22,415
"Oh, look at the monster!"

660
00:35:22,481 --> 00:35:23,372
The point is,
I have always loved

661
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:25,419
the spirit of the beach buggy.

662
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:28,169
I love the era that
created it and all of that.

663
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:30,692
But the one thing
that's made me not like it

664
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,466
is the engine reminds me
of Hitler.

665
00:35:33,614 --> 00:35:37,294
I have removed all of that
Hitler DNA from mine,

666
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,333
fitted a bloody great V8.

667
00:35:39,426 --> 00:35:41,629
It's gone too far.

668
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,973
- It's Frankenstein's buggy.
- I can settle this.

669
00:35:45,106 --> 00:35:47,231
- Yours isn't a proper beach buggy.
- It isn't.

670
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:50,322
- But it's more of a beach buggy than yours.
- Oh, rubbish!

671
00:35:50,353 --> 00:35:52,767
Because the true spirit
of the beach buggy

672
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:54,900
is the Beetle floorpan
and engine, which his has.

673
00:35:54,978 --> 00:35:56,119
Yours doesn't have the engine.

674
00:35:56,143 --> 00:35:57,220
Mine actually has everything.

675
00:35:57,244 --> 00:35:58,814
Mine is the proper beach buggy.

676
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,040
- I'm sorry about this, James, but...
- You're not.

677
00:36:01,115 --> 00:36:02,619
Your car was created

678
00:36:02,652 --> 00:36:05,236
by the swinging '60s
and endorsed by Steve McQueen,

679
00:36:05,285 --> 00:36:07,509
one of the coolest people
who ever lived,

680
00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:09,724
and yet, somehow,
you have managed

681
00:36:09,813 --> 00:36:11,912
to make your beach buggy boring.

682
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:13,138
- Rubbish
- It is a bit.

683
00:36:13,163 --> 00:36:15,810
- It is boring.
- It's a boring firework display.

684
00:36:15,904 --> 00:36:18,560
- It is.
- It's boring in that it works.

685
00:36:18,585 --> 00:36:20,396
- No, James.
- It doesn't work!

686
00:36:20,536 --> 00:36:22,560
The only thing
that has gone wrong in my car

687
00:36:22,585 --> 00:36:23,959
is a small leak
in the petrol tank.

688
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:26,031
Everything else about it
has constantly worked.

689
00:36:26,121 --> 00:36:27,880
Do you know, every time
I've overtaken you,

690
00:36:27,905 --> 00:36:29,716
I've looked and thought, "That's
dismal."

691
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:32,094
It isn't. It has an elegance
and a purity.

692
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,254
And when you say,
"You've never come past me,"

693
00:36:34,286 --> 00:36:37,818
I come past you every 30 miles
because you've run out of fuel.

694
00:36:37,873 --> 00:36:41,942
It wheelies, the throttle sticks, the
alternator falls off, bolts fall out of it.

695
00:36:41,977 --> 00:36:45,546
- It... The alternator...
- You've had to fit a wing on it, which ruins the looks.

696
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:47,146
It's not in the spirit
of the beach buggy,

697
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,676
and... but of a man desperately trying
to justify a terrible idea.

698
00:36:50,745 --> 00:36:53,113
- It was a brilliant idea!
- It doesn't work!

699
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,614
I'm fairly conscious right now

700
00:36:54,689 --> 00:36:56,758
your car is drinking the fuel
out of mine

701
00:36:56,834 --> 00:36:58,942
like a sort of plastic vampire.

702
00:36:59,106 --> 00:37:01,121
Look, mine has been thirsty.

703
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,395
- Thirsty?
- Yes.

704
00:37:02,434 --> 00:37:03,871
We continued arguing

705
00:37:03,903 --> 00:37:08,106
until Giovanni reminded us
it was time to go to bed.

706
00:37:08,214 --> 00:37:10,153
But I didn't go to bed,

707
00:37:10,325 --> 00:37:13,645
because I had business
to attend to.

708
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,051
Right, Jeremy Clarkson
thinks he's being flamboyant,

709
00:37:17,121 --> 00:37:19,926
and he doesn't realise that
my knowledge of aerodynamics

710
00:37:19,981 --> 00:37:23,871
will trump his ability to fit
rubber penises to people's cars.

711
00:37:41,216 --> 00:37:42,418
Shit!

712
00:37:47,621 --> 00:37:49,700
Hammond! Fire!

713
00:37:49,796 --> 00:37:51,301
Help!

714
00:37:51,773 --> 00:37:54,098
Hammond! Help!

715
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:01,832
The next morning,
as we resumed our journey,

716
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,528
I was feeling
rather philosophical.

717
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:07,608
I once saw an old lady fall over

718
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:11,153
and drop her shopping bag on
the opposite side of the road,

719
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:12,864
and her shopping fell out.

720
00:38:13,035 --> 00:38:14,512
And amongst it
was an Easter egg,

721
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:18,127
which I assume she bought for
a grandchild or something,

722
00:38:18,287 --> 00:38:20,877
and it rolled into the road
and got run over by a car.

723
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,878
It was the most tragic thing
I've ever seen...

724
00:38:24,947 --> 00:38:27,877
until I saw the front
of my car this morning.

725
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:36,328
And it wasn't just the front
of his own car he'd ruined.

726
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:45,703
I wouldn't mind, but the rattling from
James's workmanship is appalling.

727
00:38:48,931 --> 00:38:52,416
Despite everything, though,
we were now almost there.

728
00:38:52,476 --> 00:38:55,345
Today, we would reach the
beach that marked the finish

729
00:38:55,395 --> 00:38:58,445
of what had been
a spectacular journey

730
00:38:58,532 --> 00:39:01,439
through a spectacular country.

731
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,464
Oh!

732
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:07,748
That deserves a stabbing.

733
00:39:09,593 --> 00:39:12,355
Oh, my God!

734
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:14,902
Oh!

735
00:39:19,403 --> 00:39:21,571
Oh, my...

736
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,142
Giovanni,
could you run the baths?

737
00:39:27,487 --> 00:39:29,418
Aargh!

738
00:39:29,513 --> 00:39:31,818
Help!

739
00:39:32,224 --> 00:39:35,592
It really is an amazing part
of the world, this.

740
00:39:35,617 --> 00:39:39,006
But everything that makes it
amazing is harsh

741
00:39:39,036 --> 00:39:41,171
and unforgiving and difficult.

742
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:46,430
Oh, stop!

743
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:49,834
No one's ever said this
before, but Namibia...

744
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:54,371
is a beautiful bastard
of a country.

745
00:40:03,431 --> 00:40:04,681
And yet,

746
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:08,152
as we counted down the last
few miles of our journey,

747
00:40:08,177 --> 00:40:12,697
our home-made beach buggies
were still running.

748
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:17,259
They were battered and bruised, but
they'd proved our point to Mr Wilman.

749
00:40:18,077 --> 00:40:19,666
They'd made it.

750
00:40:21,572 --> 00:40:23,650
And they had done
something else as well -

751
00:40:23,728 --> 00:40:25,236
they'd got under our skin.

752
00:40:25,347 --> 00:40:27,748
We liked them
even more at the end

753
00:40:27,905 --> 00:40:30,380
than we had done at the start.

754
00:40:30,582 --> 00:40:33,043
I think everybody in the world
should drive a beach buggy,

755
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:36,348
because you're exposed
to so much.

756
00:40:36,446 --> 00:40:38,043
Not just the elements,

757
00:40:38,184 --> 00:40:41,059
but the opinions
of other people.

758
00:40:41,151 --> 00:40:42,551
I mean, when you're in
a normal car,

759
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:44,995
you shake your fist
and make gestures,

760
00:40:45,055 --> 00:40:46,356
and shout and yell,

761
00:40:46,423 --> 00:40:49,126
because you feel
cocooned and safe

762
00:40:49,176 --> 00:40:52,176
and immune from everybody.

763
00:40:52,396 --> 00:40:56,068
But in a beach buggy,
everyone's just there.

764
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,135
It's brilliant!

765
00:40:58,324 --> 00:41:01,186
It's such a friendly way
of moving about.

766
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,341
And with that, we settled down

767
00:41:04,366 --> 00:41:08,570
for what we hoped would be
a smooth cruise to the beach.

768
00:41:08,748 --> 00:41:10,123
But it wasn't.

769
00:41:10,209 --> 00:41:11,693
Ow! Ow!

770
00:41:12,785 --> 00:41:14,350
Oh, God! Ow!

771
00:41:19,207 --> 00:41:20,942
This is outrageous!

772
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:24,209
Holy shit!

773
00:41:26,873 --> 00:41:28,490
Oh, no! It's gone!

774
00:41:28,662 --> 00:41:32,785
And now my aerodynamics
are badly affected as well.

775
00:41:35,607 --> 00:41:37,277
Oh, my word!

776
00:41:38,406 --> 00:41:40,753
Jeremy is hoping
to get to the finish line

777
00:41:40,886 --> 00:41:43,730
in the sort of pile of scrap
you hate your neighbours

778
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,097
for keeping at the bottom
of their garden.

779
00:41:49,085 --> 00:41:50,320
Oh, God!

780
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,496
Oh, no! There's petrol!

781
00:41:57,647 --> 00:42:00,850
Oh! Hammond,
don't go near his car!

782
00:42:01,012 --> 00:42:03,348
There's petrol all over
the front of his car.

783
00:42:03,468 --> 00:42:04,536
- Is there?
- Yeah.

784
00:42:04,632 --> 00:42:06,180
Ooh!

785
00:42:06,376 --> 00:42:08,402
What if it caught fire, James?

786
00:42:13,578 --> 00:42:15,414
With just 30 miles to go,

787
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,410
the mighty seven-cylinder V8
really started to play up.

788
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,522
Oh, no!

789
00:42:28,894 --> 00:42:30,800
And then it started to go dark,

790
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:34,378
which presented us with the
biggest problem of the lot.

791
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:39,253
That's just terrible.

792
00:42:39,285 --> 00:42:41,420
Oh, God!

793
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:43,175
Well, that's marvellous.

794
00:42:43,808 --> 00:42:45,219
That one is dazzling me

795
00:42:45,244 --> 00:42:47,894
and that one is showing me where
to go.

796
00:42:49,006 --> 00:42:51,839
This is far from ideal.

797
00:42:52,113 --> 00:42:53,918
Before pitch darkness fell,

798
00:42:53,943 --> 00:42:57,580
we pulled over to do
some emergency repairs.

799
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,691
I'm gonna put some...

800
00:43:00,022 --> 00:43:03,192
tape of a certain well-known
brand on the problem.

801
00:43:04,841 --> 00:43:06,308
Finger tight will do.

802
00:43:06,398 --> 00:43:09,785
These repairs
were extremely successful.

803
00:43:13,544 --> 00:43:16,281
Oh, it's swung into my face!

804
00:43:16,749 --> 00:43:19,844
No, I can't see a thing.
Agh! That's worse!

805
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:24,277
Oh, God. Now they've turned.

806
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:27,384
Oh, no! My car's gone
cross-eyed again!

807
00:43:29,949 --> 00:43:32,246
There's a man
coming the other way.

808
00:43:32,355 --> 00:43:33,886
What's he gonna think of us?

809
00:43:34,082 --> 00:43:35,094
I don't know.

810
00:43:35,293 --> 00:43:37,315
I can't see a bloody thing.

811
00:43:39,229 --> 00:43:41,644
Thank you.
Oh, that's good!

812
00:43:41,736 --> 00:43:43,817
It's shaken the headlight
back round again!

813
00:43:44,013 --> 00:43:47,372
Yeah! No, it's back again.
Oh, just for a moment.

814
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:53,323
Then the rough road brought
some new headlight problems.

815
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:56,847
Oh, nothing! Oh, no!
Nothing! Nothing!

816
00:43:56,964 --> 00:44:00,219
I've got...
I've now got nothing at all.

817
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:02,454
OK, Hammond and May,
can you just let me know

818
00:44:02,521 --> 00:44:05,324
what your lighting
situation is now?

819
00:44:05,417 --> 00:44:09,269
As long as I hold the flash
lever back, I have light.

820
00:44:09,339 --> 00:44:13,152
If I hold the lever, I get one
light and one flashing light, yes.

821
00:44:13,191 --> 00:44:16,183
But I have to take
my hand off to change gear.

822
00:44:16,503 --> 00:44:19,120
And then Hammond's
car suddenly turned into

823
00:44:19,145 --> 00:44:21,761
the lighting rig
at a Pink Floyd gig.

824
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:25,855
Why does it keep changing?
What...

825
00:44:25,972 --> 00:44:27,274
And it's all got...

826
00:44:32,922 --> 00:44:35,992
It's only three kilometres
to go now. Three.

827
00:44:39,146 --> 00:44:39,947
Ahh!

828
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:41,974
Oh, hell!

829
00:44:43,062 --> 00:44:44,831
Gone. Coming back.

830
00:44:46,511 --> 00:44:47,894
Although we couldn't see,

831
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:51,159
we knew we must be close
to the beach.

832
00:44:51,184 --> 00:44:53,519
It's not... you know,
a seaside beach.

833
00:44:53,597 --> 00:44:57,003
It must be on a river
or a lake, or something.

834
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,331
This is uphill.
I'm sure that's wrong.

835
00:45:03,983 --> 00:45:06,347
That's a big drop there.

836
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,894
I don't want to go off there.

837
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,296
I'm not sure this is sensible.

838
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:15,058
Nowhere in any guide
I've ever read does it say,

839
00:45:15,194 --> 00:45:18,763
"Explore new territory
in a beach buggy

840
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:21,886
with your lights all broken."

841
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:26,261
Unable to find anything even
remotely resembling a beach,

842
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,007
we pulled over.

843
00:45:29,353 --> 00:45:32,925
We cannot carry on just plunging
around in the darkness,

844
00:45:33,242 --> 00:45:34,546
hoping to find the beach.

845
00:45:34,613 --> 00:45:36,788
And, anyway, what is that noise?

846
00:45:37,929 --> 00:45:42,677
I would say
that... is a waterfall.

847
00:45:43,026 --> 00:45:45,598
Is it something you want
to come across in the dark?

848
00:45:45,942 --> 00:45:48,227
Because the other thing
I'd say about that sound -

849
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,488
it might be my imagination, but that
sounds as though it's coming from below,

850
00:45:51,512 --> 00:45:52,813
like we're above it.

851
00:45:52,969 --> 00:45:54,424
We have climbed up that track.

852
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,995
And a waterfall is a drop,
by definition.

853
00:45:57,026 --> 00:45:59,284
If we're... I don't want to...
in the dark.

854
00:45:59,317 --> 00:46:01,606
Abandon. I'm not doing it.

855
00:46:01,689 --> 00:46:03,854
We'll do it tomorrow. Sun.

856
00:46:04,002 --> 00:46:06,752
Let's look at the stars and
have one more night in Namibia.

857
00:46:06,862 --> 00:46:09,024
We'll find it tomorrow and it'll
be fantastically glorious.

858
00:46:09,048 --> 00:46:10,299
Tomorrow on the beach.

859
00:46:10,451 --> 00:46:12,753
Giovanni!

860
00:46:16,448 --> 00:46:21,073
The next morning, daylight brought
answers to our questions.

861
00:46:22,694 --> 00:46:24,429
So it wasn't a waterfall.

862
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:26,865
No, it was many waterfalls.

863
00:46:26,931 --> 00:46:28,463
Hundreds of waterfalls.

864
00:46:36,979 --> 00:46:39,663
And they were just part
of what we all agreed

865
00:46:39,756 --> 00:46:44,473
was the most beautiful view
we'd ever seen.

866
00:46:54,335 --> 00:46:57,971
But... many waterfalls.

867
00:46:58,129 --> 00:47:00,152
No beach that I can see.

868
00:47:03,202 --> 00:47:04,936
Does that count as a beach?

869
00:47:05,003 --> 00:47:06,104
That is a beach.

870
00:47:06,105 --> 00:47:07,872
I'd call that a beach.

871
00:47:07,939 --> 00:47:10,942
- The beach.
- That's got to be it. There's no others.

872
00:47:11,253 --> 00:47:14,301
Gentlemen,
our quest is at an end.

873
00:47:14,488 --> 00:47:16,948
Let us ride...

874
00:47:17,015 --> 00:47:20,481
in splendour... to...

875
00:47:20,689 --> 00:47:23,473
- I'm not finishing that very well. What is it?
- It's very moving.

876
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,866
I'm trying to think of something
evocative and Victorian and brilliant.

877
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:29,151
"Let's go over there
and finish our journey"?

878
00:47:29,176 --> 00:47:30,862
No, that's Brummie rubbish!

879
00:47:30,929 --> 00:47:32,160
- It is!
- It's the fact.

880
00:47:32,185 --> 00:47:36,022
Unable to find the right
words to mark the moment...

881
00:47:36,868 --> 00:47:38,723
we set off anyway.

882
00:47:41,873 --> 00:47:43,621
Yeah, this is it.

883
00:47:46,311 --> 00:47:49,770
We are half a kilometre
from our objective.

884
00:47:53,774 --> 00:47:55,076
Oh.

885
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:58,660
Oh, no. Path ends. Path ends.

886
00:47:59,057 --> 00:48:00,801
Erm...

887
00:48:02,961 --> 00:48:04,840
Oh, my God!

888
00:48:07,366 --> 00:48:08,733
Well, if this won't get
over there,

889
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,582
there's no way will theirs.

890
00:48:13,372 --> 00:48:16,949
We split up to look for a
path through the rocks...

891
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:19,321
Oh, no!

892
00:48:19,346 --> 00:48:22,115
But it was hopeless.

893
00:48:22,676 --> 00:48:23,887
Forget it.

894
00:48:24,973 --> 00:48:26,551
Hammond, forget it.

895
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:29,184
We aren't going down this hill.

896
00:48:32,222 --> 00:48:36,132
The problem is, even if we could get
over this stuff, which we can't...

897
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:37,079
No, we can't.

898
00:48:37,104 --> 00:48:40,564
Have you seen what's
between us and the beach?

899
00:48:40,774 --> 00:48:44,360
Look at it. There's no way you could
drive over that or anywhere near.

900
00:48:44,431 --> 00:48:46,868
- Look, you can't even go inland.
- No, we can't go there.

901
00:48:46,907 --> 00:48:48,236
And you can't go
around that mountain

902
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,087
and come at it from the back,
cos they're cliffs.

903
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:58,423
Wait a minute.

904
00:48:58,656 --> 00:49:00,462
What?

905
00:49:00,574 --> 00:49:02,064
I've had...

906
00:49:03,259 --> 00:49:04,770
a great idea.

907
00:49:04,868 --> 00:49:07,292
- Oh, no.
- No.

908
00:49:07,728 --> 00:49:10,395
So we can't drive over here.

909
00:49:10,728 --> 00:49:16,181
But we have to get us and our
cars to that beach over there.

910
00:49:17,302 --> 00:49:20,259
If there were to be
some kind of...

911
00:49:20,556 --> 00:49:23,392
A mounting point on that
cliff, maybe, and then...

912
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:24,550
Do what?

913
00:49:24,591 --> 00:49:26,821
No.
Mounting point down there.

914
00:49:26,845 --> 00:49:28,680
Over that distance?
That's a huge distance.

915
00:49:28,747 --> 00:49:30,282
- It's about half a kilometre.
- No!

916
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:32,165
But can you imagine
the forces on it?

917
00:49:32,228 --> 00:49:34,553
- The things at the end are gonna have to be...
- Huge.

918
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:37,548
- Massive.
- Jeremy, we don't all live in a cartoon.

919
00:49:37,573 --> 00:49:39,181
We will die! Dead!

920
00:49:42,527 --> 00:49:45,196
Given that
there were no alternatives,

921
00:49:45,266 --> 00:49:47,100
we had to go with
the ape's plan,

922
00:49:47,132 --> 00:49:52,537
which was to turn our beach
buggies into cable cars.

923
00:49:52,821 --> 00:49:56,107
- That's over two metres.
- Yeah, that's good enough.

924
00:49:56,337 --> 00:49:59,278
So we headed to
a nearby abandoned mine...

925
00:50:00,612 --> 00:50:02,712
to scavenge materials.

926
00:50:05,564 --> 00:50:06,884
Is that bit any good?

927
00:50:06,944 --> 00:50:11,267
- How much more of that cable have we got?
- Four drums.

928
00:50:11,292 --> 00:50:12,425
- Are you proposing that,

929
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,704
that becomes a winding drum?
- Yeah.

930
00:50:14,729 --> 00:50:16,995
It's very important...

931
00:50:17,293 --> 00:50:20,932
we get as much weight as
possible into Hammond's car...

932
00:50:20,999 --> 00:50:23,536
for erm...
well, for your amusement.

933
00:50:29,145 --> 00:50:30,543
Right, toolbox.

934
00:50:37,522 --> 00:50:40,168
- How much do you want?
- 30 metres.

935
00:50:46,379 --> 00:50:48,993
James, have you got that hoop
welded in yet?

936
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,747
No, that's my next job.

937
00:50:55,426 --> 00:50:57,262
Several days later,

938
00:50:57,372 --> 00:51:00,020
and with absolutely no help
whatsoever

939
00:51:00,114 --> 00:51:04,098
from any Namibian
mining engineers...

940
00:51:04,567 --> 00:51:08,192
the world's first beach buggy
cable car was ready, and...

941
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,629
Shit! Stop, everybody!

942
00:51:09,654 --> 00:51:13,090
The goats are eating the tree
that we've anchored it to.

943
00:51:13,227 --> 00:51:16,333
Shoo, goats! Shoo!

944
00:51:18,557 --> 00:51:20,747
They were eating the tree.

945
00:51:20,859 --> 00:51:22,661
Anyway, as I was saying,

946
00:51:22,727 --> 00:51:25,215
it stretched for more
than a third of a mile.

947
00:51:25,395 --> 00:51:28,340
And since the drop to
the crocodile-infested river

948
00:51:28,403 --> 00:51:30,369
was several hundred feet,

949
00:51:30,402 --> 00:51:32,653
we decided
James should go first.

950
00:51:33,353 --> 00:51:34,854
- We had a vote.
- Did you?

951
00:51:34,895 --> 00:51:37,465
We did, and we were unanimous
you were going first.

952
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:39,394
Right, so it's become
a democracy all of a sudden?

953
00:51:39,418 --> 00:51:40,934
- Yes, it has.
- Yeah.

954
00:51:41,043 --> 00:51:42,514
And anyway,
your car's the lightest,

955
00:51:42,581 --> 00:51:44,465
now you've burned half
of it away.

956
00:51:44,466 --> 00:51:46,360
♪♪

957
00:51:46,385 --> 00:51:49,668
I'm climbing in.
Jesus!

958
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,161
With the state-of-the-art
generators fired up...

959
00:51:57,393 --> 00:52:00,262
James fortified himself
for the journey...

960
00:52:01,731 --> 00:52:03,254
Is he drinking?

961
00:52:03,473 --> 00:52:06,354
And then simply drove off
the launch pad.

962
00:52:06,471 --> 00:52:08,473
Oh, my God! Whoa!

963
00:52:10,984 --> 00:52:13,039
Oh, shit! It's really high!

964
00:52:13,273 --> 00:52:16,280
It's really high!
I'm turning the engine off.

965
00:52:16,727 --> 00:52:18,617
- We had to test it.
- Well, exactly.

966
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,852
- He had to go first.
- Don't look at us and think we're bad.

967
00:52:21,967 --> 00:52:24,805
Because that was
scientifically vigorous.

968
00:52:30,797 --> 00:52:32,484
It's a cable car.
It's a cable car.

969
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,953
I've been on lots of
cable cars. They're safe.

970
00:52:35,172 --> 00:52:38,367
God. Look, he's... This is where it's high.
That's horrible.

971
00:52:41,316 --> 00:52:43,539
No! It's going really high!
I don't like...

972
00:52:46,961 --> 00:52:48,346
I hate you!

973
00:52:48,447 --> 00:52:50,449
- OK.
- He doesn't like us.

974
00:52:54,327 --> 00:52:58,421
Despite my terror, the cable
buggy kept on chugging through

975
00:52:58,477 --> 00:53:02,930
what's technically Angolan
airspace towards the beach.

976
00:53:03,194 --> 00:53:04,711
God, I'm nearly there!

977
00:53:07,065 --> 00:53:09,219
Neutral. Handbrake off.

978
00:53:09,555 --> 00:53:11,470
He's gonna do it.
He's gonna do it.

979
00:53:11,536 --> 00:53:12,922
I'm at the end!

980
00:53:15,648 --> 00:53:17,883
- He's down.
- That's a landing.

981
00:53:17,939 --> 00:53:19,875
Yes!

982
00:53:20,453 --> 00:53:22,000
- Do you know what, though?
- What?

983
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,062
- I'm doing maths here.
- Mm?

984
00:53:24,211 --> 00:53:27,085
One of us is gonna be killed
doing this, obviously, yes?

985
00:53:27,151 --> 00:53:31,555
- I'd say so, yeah.
- So when we were all here, 33% chance.

986
00:53:31,672 --> 00:53:33,900
Now I'm doing it
with a 50% chance.

987
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:35,611
- Now you're doing it?
- I'm going next.

988
00:53:35,635 --> 00:53:37,281
- I can go next.
- You can't go next.

989
00:53:37,353 --> 00:53:39,821
Why can't I go next?

990
00:53:40,131 --> 00:53:43,969
Whilst James toasted his success
with some more drink...

991
00:53:45,273 --> 00:53:49,383
I won the argument
and prepared for launch.

992
00:53:49,654 --> 00:53:51,945
Why is my car at this angle?

993
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:55,492
Well, maybe because there's a massive
V8 hanging out the back of it.

994
00:53:55,547 --> 00:53:58,008
Right! Right, right, right!

995
00:53:58,082 --> 00:53:59,672
I'll... here we go.

996
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:13,898
My rectum has just opened like
a set of theatre curtains.

997
00:54:14,133 --> 00:54:16,876
And for good reason,
because my beach buggy

998
00:54:16,901 --> 00:54:21,875
weighed 200 kilograms more
than James's charred wreck.

999
00:54:24,643 --> 00:54:27,953
Ooh! Ooh!
He brushed the grass!

1000
00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:32,717
I'm terrified, I'll be honest,

1001
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:35,554
but, for the first time
since I set off,

1002
00:54:35,587 --> 00:54:37,789
I'm comfortable
in my beach buggy.

1003
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:52,781
Approaching the beach. Approaching
the end of the journey.

1004
00:54:53,026 --> 00:54:54,461
Here I come.

1005
00:54:55,053 --> 00:54:57,812
And... touchdown!

1006
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:00,359
Yes!

1007
00:55:00,524 --> 00:55:03,259
Bad news, Hammond. I've
made it.

1008
00:55:03,381 --> 00:55:05,109
Oh, great.

1009
00:55:05,375 --> 00:55:08,492
- Sir?
- Oh, I say, James!

1010
00:55:08,773 --> 00:55:10,822
Actually, I was lucky
there was some left,

1011
00:55:10,889 --> 00:55:14,961
because James had had a bit of a
thirst on whilst he'd been alone.

1012
00:55:16,227 --> 00:55:17,428
Hello, guys down there.

1013
00:55:17,495 --> 00:55:19,664
It's Richard at the top.

1014
00:55:19,831 --> 00:55:22,695
Right, I'm gonna do this now,
so goodbye.

1015
00:55:26,658 --> 00:55:29,023
Oh!
I don't like that feeling!

1016
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:37,664
Here he comes, ladies and
gentlemen, Richard Hammond.

1017
00:55:38,048 --> 00:55:39,219
No!

1018
00:55:41,578 --> 00:55:44,375
I could take solace from
the fact that this system

1019
00:55:44,445 --> 00:55:48,180
has already run twice with their cars
and not failed - it's been tested.

1020
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:50,234
Or I could take
a more realistic view,

1021
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:54,430
which is that those two fat
oafs have already weakened it.

1022
00:55:55,141 --> 00:55:57,367
Plus he had all
that scrap metal in the back,

1023
00:55:57,422 --> 00:55:59,671
which is why
all eyes were on him.

1024
00:55:59,738 --> 00:56:02,070
Well, when I say "all"...

1025
00:56:02,523 --> 00:56:04,961
Look at the colours
in those rocks over there.

1026
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:07,626
It's... It's fantastic.

1027
00:56:07,779 --> 00:56:10,000
Just to the left
of where Hammond is.

1028
00:56:12,945 --> 00:56:15,609
Why's my car sitting so low?
It is heavy.

1029
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,711
It is... Why's it lower?

1030
00:56:17,891 --> 00:56:20,664
- The colouring is fabulous, isn't it?
- Yeah, they are.

1031
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:28,016
Despite all my fears,
the cables were holding

1032
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:31,477
and drawing me ever closer
to my colleagues.

1033
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:33,922
This is it.
I can see the beach.

1034
00:56:34,062 --> 00:56:36,078
I'm so nearly there.
We are gonna do it!

1035
00:56:37,504 --> 00:56:39,297
Come on, Hammond. Come on.

1036
00:56:41,173 --> 00:56:43,209
I'm gonna do it.

1037
00:56:43,743 --> 00:56:45,672
Come on, Hammond. Come on.

1038
00:56:50,252 --> 00:56:51,520
Oh.

1039
00:56:54,106 --> 00:56:55,640
Erm...

1040
00:56:57,096 --> 00:56:58,564
Why have I stopped?

1041
00:56:58,697 --> 00:57:00,547
- Hammond!
- Come on!

1042
00:57:00,656 --> 00:57:02,242
- I've stopped!
- Hammond!

1043
00:57:02,344 --> 00:57:04,068
It's just stopped!

1044
00:57:04,281 --> 00:57:06,000
What can I do?
It's just stopped!

1045
00:57:06,148 --> 00:57:09,070
There's, like, 200 metres to go!

1046
00:57:09,187 --> 00:57:12,043
I don't have anything to do
with it! It's not up to me!

1047
00:57:12,152 --> 00:57:14,680
Is there nothing you can do?

1048
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:16,937
Sadly, James was
too drunk to think,

1049
00:57:17,006 --> 00:57:19,315
and I'm mechanically inept.

1050
00:57:19,461 --> 00:57:22,721
Plus, whatever had gone wrong
had gone wrong at the top,

1051
00:57:22,846 --> 00:57:24,541
and we were at the bottom.

1052
00:57:24,682 --> 00:57:26,244
Move! Move! Move!

1053
00:57:26,345 --> 00:57:28,432
There's literally
nothing we can do.

1054
00:57:28,494 --> 00:57:29,761
We've assessed everything

1055
00:57:29,828 --> 00:57:32,166
and you're in
a hopeless position.

1056
00:57:33,414 --> 00:57:35,216
We could have another beer.

1057
00:57:40,518 --> 00:57:42,588
We've gonna have to conclude,
I'm afraid,

1058
00:57:42,631 --> 00:57:47,408
that Mr Wilman was right that
the beach buggy is no good.

1059
00:57:47,651 --> 00:57:51,073
And on that terrible
disappointment, it's time to end.

1060
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:54,213
Thank you so much
for watching. Good night.
