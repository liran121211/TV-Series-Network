00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,923
There is actually
a very good reason for that.

16
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,594
It is because these two
last week blew up my house,

17
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:36,230
and I literally have
nowhere else to go.

He did do that.
Anyway, erm...

22
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:47,675
we were reminiscing,
as we've been here all week,

23
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:51,345
and we worked out
that Yorkshire
is the only place on earth

24
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:55,082

have had a car crash.

you in Yorkshire?

38
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:27,315
Well, me, I'll tell you.
No, 1977,

39
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,383
when the driving examiner
said to me,

40
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,752
"Congratulations,
Mr Clarkson, you've passed,"

41
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,722
what I heard was,
"Congratulations,
Mr Clarkson,

42
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,990
you are the best driver
I've ever seen."

- Oh, no.
- 36 hours later -

44
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,029
That's all it was, 36 hours
I'd been on the roads -

45
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,431
stuffed my mother's Audi.

46
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,266

So, if you're the farmer,
sorry about that.

49
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:51,405
Er... Anyway, I'm glad
we're still in Yorkshire,

50
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:56,377
because last week we said
there was no real motoring
connection with the county,

51
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:59,247
and it turns out
that's not true.

52
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:01,382
I was reading Trip Advisor
last night.

53
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,885
Now, Trip Advisor is a
website for the mealy-mouthed
and the bitter.

54
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,520
Well, hang on.
I mean, it's not entirely--

55
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:09,122
No, seriously, it's useless
apart from anything else,

56
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:14,262
because you have to know
someone before their opinion
is relevant.

57
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,096
I mean, I know Hammond, OK?

58
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,532
So if he tells me
a restaurant's great,

59
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,335
I know
I don't want to go there,
because it'll be rubbish.

60
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:25,038
You're absolutely right,
actually, because that bloke
in the hat over there,

61
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,909
I don't care how many stars
he gives Oxfam Whitby,
I'm not going there.

63
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,513
Exactly. Anyway...

64
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:37,285
I went on Trip Advisor,
OK, and there was
a review of Whitby.

65
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,688
And it said,
and I'm quoting here,

66
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:44,758
"One aspect of Whitby
is the large number
of local chavs..."

68
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:48,596
"...who drive around
the town in a circuit

69
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,699
in their
noise-enhanced cars."

70
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,335
Already,
I don't like this person.

71
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,169
"They accelerated
down the narrow streets

72
00:03:56,304 --> 00:04:00,408
and then slowed their engines
down quickly as they
approached a junction,

73
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:03,644
causing explosive-sounding
backfiring."

74
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:04,978
(LAUGHTER)

75
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,447
He sounds like a right knob.

76
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:07,715
Of course he's a right knob,

77
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,117
he's leaving a message
on Trip Advisor.

78
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,921
Anyway, the police -
the police, the local
police here -

79
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,490
they've decided
they've had enough of people,
how they put it,

80
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:21,529
"...driving away in a manner
that causes their wheels
to spin and screech."

81
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,531
OK? So they decided
to have a clampdown.

82
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,799
But,
and this is the quote I love,

83
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:29,069
"The operation was curtailed
due to poor weather."

84
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,405
(LAUGHTER)

85
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:32,806
What, are they saying...

86
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,942
They didn't go out
because it was raining?

87
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,945
No, law enforcement
in Whitby is like cricket.

88
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,348
Everybody just goes inside
if it starts to drizzle.

89
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:43,851
So this is... This is
the Whitby Town Police
we are talking about here?

90
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,853
-Yeah, the WTPD.
-Yeah.

92
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:50,023

95
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:56,364

on our car show tonight...

105
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,789
a tree falls over...

106
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,559
... a hedgehog
makes a noise...

107
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,029
...and a dog eats some meat.

108
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,900
But we begin with Porsche.

109
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:37,137
They offer an immense
and immensely complicated
range of cars

110
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,407
all under the 911 banner.

111
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:43,544
Now, Porsche enthusiasts,
by which I mean
these two imbeciles,

112
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:46,113
say that they're all
slightly different.

113
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,548
Completely different.

114
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,182
No, slightly different,

115
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:53,086
and that the best of
the bunch is something
called the GT3 RS.

116
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:57,625
So I thought
I'd take it to our track
to see what it was like.

117
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,428
And let's just hope that,
for once in your life,

118
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,129
you haven't
behaved like a child.

119
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:06,299

-Well, just said it's no good
because I've got one.

(LAUGHTER)

125
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,819
This is the car in question.

126
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:30,458
No, wait. Sorry. Hang on.

127
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,359
It's easy to be confused.

128
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,594
This is it.

129
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:39,833
The hottest, hardest,

130
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,636
tightest 911 of them all...

131
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,873
...and the most exotic.

132
00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:01,889
It has the fattest back tyres
I've ever seen on a road car.

133
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,625
It has scaffolding
in the back for stiffness,

134
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,260
carbon-fibre body panels
for lightness.

135
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,797
The roof is made
from magnesium,

136
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,500
so if you turn it over
and there are sparks,

137
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,835
there will be
a blinding flash of light,

138
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,804
and then you will have
a convertible.

139
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:30,818
Like many people,
I don't really like the idea
of the Porsche 911,

140
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,954
and I certainly don't like
the people who drive them.

141
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:38,692
I find them flawed,
in some dark and
rather disgusting way.

142
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,528
But I will grudgingly admit

143
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,597
that even the basic
cooking models are...

144
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,966
extremely lovely to drive.

145
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,034
They're...

146
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,537
They're just very good
sports cars.

147
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,407
But what about this one?

148
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:55,576
Well...

149
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,211
Let's find out.

150
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:07,420
Straight away,
I can tell you the engine...

151
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,356
is incredible.

152

(REVVING)

153
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,160
There's no turbocharging.

154
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:18,098
It's just a four litre
flat-six, but...

155
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,568
you get 500 horsepower.

156
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:25,338
And its red line at 9,000rpm.

157

158
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,380
9,000!

159
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,082
That's bike territory.

160
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:41,855
But the best thing is the way
it goes round corners.

161
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:44,625
Because it's got
four-wheel steering,

162
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:49,262
and because the engine
is sitting right over
the rear axle,

163
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,666
the grip is just astonishing.

if I can unstick it.

no loss of traction at all.

I thought, when I read
the spec sheet on the RS,

174
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:30,638
that Porsche
had tried to make a supercar,

175
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:35,275
a rival for Ferrari
and McLaren and Lamborghini,
but they haven't.

176
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,177
It's still a sports car.

177
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,647
It's still chuckable
and deft.

178
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,885
(TYRES SCREECHING)

179
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:48,288
Whoa! It's very, very good.

180
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,657
Annoyingly.

181
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:59,066
But... is it as good as this,

182
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,035
the BMW M4 GTS?

183
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:07,641
Like the Porsche,
it's made from exotic
lightweight materials...

184
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:11,478
and fitted with scaffolding
instead of back seats,

185
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,180
and enormous tyres.

186
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,050
It looks good.

187
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,986
But there are some problems.

188
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,590
When you arrive at a small
speed hump in the Porsche,

189
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:27,060
you raise its nose
electrically and all is well.

190
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,965
But when you arrive at
the same hump in the BMW...

191
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:36,804
you will need a team of men
to fold away the spoiler

192
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,572
and adjust the ride height.

193
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,308
This takes several hours.

194
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,246
There are some other issues
as well.

195
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:51,852
To give owners the sense
they're driving a racing car,

196
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,855
all of the storage bins
have been removed.

197
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:57,825
There's no cubbyhole here,
no door pockets.

198
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,060
That means there's
nowhere to put anything.

199
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:04,297
And I think that,
on a day-to-day basis, that
would drive you a bit mad.

200
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,238
Then there's the ride,
which is extremely bumpy,

201
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:14,908
and the drone from the tyres,
which is horrendous.

202
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,878
(RUMBLING)

203
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,747
After ten minutes
on a motorway,

204
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,214
you will have a headache,

205
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,751
and you won't have any
headache pills with you,

206
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,152
because there was
nowhere to put them.

207
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:30,423
Now, at this point,
I would normally use
the word "however"

208
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,761
and start talking about
the car's good points.

209
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,563
However...

210
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,799
I can't, because...

211
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,969
I'm struggling to find any.

212
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:46,039
The engine, for example,
has water injection,

213
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,475
which sounds cool.

214
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,212
But it means
that every third time
you fill the car with fuel,

215
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,949
you have to fill
a water tank in the boot.

216
00:11:56,016 --> 00:12:01,955
I don't know, but I'm not
sure this is very hi-tech.

217
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:08,128
And then there's
the steering, which
in comfort mode is horrid,

218
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:11,298
and in sport setting
is even more horrid.

219
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:15,168
That said,
the steering wheel is nice.

220
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,270
It's good and thick. It's...

221
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,974
It's like holding onto
something from
the Ron Jeremy range.

222
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,910
And the seats aren't bad.

223
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,111
But other than that...

224
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:26,947
No.

225
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:29,817
A point that becomes
even more obvious

226
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,352
when you go into battle
against the Porsche.

227
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:41,161
We both have
around 500 horsepower,

228
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:44,097
both have a top speed
of around 190,

229
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:47,534
but the Porsche
is a lot lighter.

230
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:53,140
Probably because it doesn't
have a tank full of water
in the boot.

231
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:03,450
Struggling to keep up now.

232
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,888
Here we go, into Swindon.

233
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,890
Oh, "Springs"!

234
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,959
A pampas grass shop.

235
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,494
Oh! We're having...
God, that's nasty.

236
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,299
This is not a car
that responds well

237
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:22,569
to my rather brutal
driving style.

238
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,006
The problem is...

239
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:29,943
it doesn't really respond
very well to delicacy,
either.

240
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:37,885
This competition here now
between these two cars

241
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:41,922
is like a boxing match
between an actual boxer

242
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,257
and someone
who thinks they're a boxer

243
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,493
because they're wearing
satin shorts.

244
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:15,923
How did BMW get
this thing so wrong?

245
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,157
Oh, God!

246
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:23,030
It's twitchy,
it's unpredictable.

247
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,331
And in the rain,

248
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,968
it's somewhere between
spiteful and undrive...

249
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,970
Oh, God! ...undriveable.

250
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:40,547
But, that said, this has to
be the winner of this test

251
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,582
because Richard Hammond...

252
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,452
...has got one of those.

253
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,791
(CHEERING)

254
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,160
RICHARD: I called it.

255
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:55,728
That was annoying.

256
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,664
That was
a professional review.

257
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,999
At points.

258
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,467
But you were doing so well,

259
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,269
and then you ruined it
at the end.

260
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,336
What do you mean, ruined it?

261
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,972
By saying you'd have
a worse car

262
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,673
because I haven't got one.

263
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,276
-That Porsche wounded me.
-Wounded you?

264
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:12,812
It did wound me,
because, you know,
it's got so much grip

265
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,247
that you're sort of
forced into the seat?

266
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,083
And the seat's
got stitching on it

267
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,517
which digs a hole
in your back.

268
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,552
I've got a picture
of what it did. Look at this!

269
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,588
-That's my back!
-(AUDIENCE GROANING)

270
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,092
JAMES: Oh, I'm amazed
you weren't hospitalised
with that! That's horrific!

271
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,995
-That is a savage wound!
-Mine's never done that
to me.

272
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:31,331
That's cos you're a midget!
You don't reach that
high up the seat.

273
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,866
Or maybe you're a freak
and sit in the wrong place.

274
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,336
It's not just the fact
it wounds you.

275
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:39,539
Also, the Porsche's
more expensive than the BMW.

276
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,010
Yes, but I'd rather spend
£131,000 on the Porsche

277
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,813
than £120,000 on a BMW that's
not very good on the road,

278
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,248
not very good on a track,

279
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,183
and no good
at all in the rain.

280
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,684
Yeah, no,
that's fair enough.

281
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,120
-Hold on.
-What?

282
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,122
I've got to the bottom of
the problem with the BMW.

283
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,889
It's right here
in the blurb.

284
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:58,491
"Developed on
the Nürburgring."

285
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,293
(LAUGHTER)

286
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,262
Yeah, and, actually,
speaking of tracks,

287
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:05,465
it's now time
to hand the M4 over

288
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:09,802
to a man who thinks
that sparkling water
is basically communist.

289
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,405
Yeah, time to give it
to the American.

290
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,676
There he is.

291
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,945
And he's off! No messing.

292
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:20,647
Parps from the exhaust
on the upshifts

293
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,250
as he attacks
the Isn't Straight.

294
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,552
I wonder if he actually
knows what he's in.

295
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,054
Driving a BMW.

296
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,290
British Motor Works.

297
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:32,425
So, that's a no, then.

298
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,594
OK, continuing up the Isn't.

299
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,131
They say it's got more power.

300
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:42,535
Than what,
my damn toothbrush?

301
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,237
OK.

302
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:47,207
Right to the end
of the Isn't now,

303
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:48,841
and into Your Name Here.

304
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:51,111
Hard on the brakes,
keeping it all in check,

305
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:55,348
and surely he'll appreciate
the turbos punching him
out of the corner.

306
00:16:55,415 --> 00:17:00,420
Turbos on an engine is
God's way of telling you it
ain't got enough cylinders.

307
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,156
My mistake.
Right, back up the Isn't.

308
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,325
Really winding up
that straight-six.

309
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:08,561
I must admit, from
the outside, it sounds good.

310
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,797
And already
he's turning in hard,

311
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,165
round the Unexploded Bomb,

312
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:15,602
into the narrowness
of Old Lady's House.

313
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:19,272
Yeah, back on the power
for the bumpy bit
towards Sub Station.

314
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,209
Idiotic splitter
in peril over the ruts.

315
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,677
Now working
the ceramic brakes hard

316
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:25,845
for the tight left.

317
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:28,715
Tickle of power.
There it is.

318
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,418
And left again
into Field Of Sheep.

319
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:34,654
A whiff of oversteer,
and across the line!

320
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,823
(CHEERING)

321
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,391
It looked tidy.

322
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,826
Yeah, it looked all right.

323
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,194
It looked tidy. Right...

324
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:43,596
Let's bring up the er...

325
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,565
Let's bring up
the leader board, if we can.

326
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:49,336
Now, there we are.
We've already had
the 911 GT3 RS round.

327
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,338
RICHARD: Wha-- And you're
not gonna show the lap?

328
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,605
Nobody's interested
in watching an American

329
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,508
being sawn in half
by a glorified Beetle.

330
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,610
-(LAUGHTER)
-It did 1:20.4.

331
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,147
Right, so, now let's see
what the M4 did.

332
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:03,383
Let's put the time up.
There it is.

333
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,584
(LAUGHS)

334
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,154
Two seconds slower,
and that's a short track.

335
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,222
That's unbelievable.
That's not good, is it?

336
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:13,193
RICHARD: No.
It's only a second faster
than a Porsche 718.

337
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,362
I know.
I mean, I admire BMW

338
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,997
for trying with that car.
I really do.

339
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:20,066
But, my God,
they've made a hash of it.

340
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,335
In fact, I'm trying
to think of a metaphor

341
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:25,838
for someone who's really tried
their hardest with something

No, nothing's coming to mind.

344
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,316
I've got nothing.
I've got nothing.

345
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:37,484
I've got nothing at all.

So, let's...
Let's move it on.

a gentle left into

350
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:53,800
OK. Right, I want to begin
with the new Ford GT.

351
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,536
You've got a picture of it
here. Now, this is...

352
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:58,838
Well, you remember
the last GT they did.

353
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:02,409
That was just an homage,
really, to the old GT40.

354
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,212
This one, they say,
is actually a racing car
on the road.

355
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:08,014
It's got a twin-turbo,
3.5 litre V6,

flappy-paddle box,

more than 600 horsepower.

358
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:15,688
The problem is, though,
I can't think of any
racing car

359
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,057
that works on the road,
really, ever.

No, they don't.

fabulous, fabulous car.

Track edition: rubbish.
It's undriveable.

363

You know,
it's a very good point,

364
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:28,701
because a racing car
on the road

365
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,338
is a bit like trying to play
tennis with a cricket bat.

366
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:32,672
It's technically possible...

367
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,574
Two totally different
disciplines.

the last GT, didn't you?

371
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,750
Yes.

372
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,985
Thank you for reminding me,
Hammond. Yes, I did.

373
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,520
-Did that go well for you?
-No, it didn't.

-Oh, did it not?
-No, it didn't.

375
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:52,024
The problem was
the insurance company said it
had to have a burglar alarm,

376
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:56,529
which blew usually when
my daughter was doing the
school play and ruined it,

377
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,265
and it had to have a tracker.

378
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:01,901
And there is nothing
on God's earth more
annoying than a tracker.

379
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,936
But I've got a tracker.
It doesn't bother me
in the slightest.

380
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,072
No, that's because you'll have
a little special place

on your hall table
with a pencil outline.

for his tracker.

-Especially for the tracker?

-What's it made of?

-Well, leather, I suppose.
-A little leather pouch.

Did you make it yourself?

-No, it came...
-A little leather pouch.

Oh, so Ferrari
sold it to you.

I bet it was.

No, it just
came with the car!

I don't think Ferrari
give it away!

on your Ferrari, OK?

403
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,184
Two stripes,
a bit like on that Ford.

00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,687
There are two stripes.
How much did you pay
for those stripes?

405
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,189
Well, they were an option.
They were £6,000.

I drive a Golf GTI, OK?

don't need an alarm,
you don't need a tracker,

those new pedestrian traffic
lights in Trafalgar Square?

America, is in London,
which is in Britain.

-But traffic lights
are only this big.

a man who isn't sure,
and a woman and a woman--

just want to cross the road?

425

What... It's like being
in the '70s with you two!

426
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:58,518
Crossing the road is now
an opportunity for you
to express your sexuality.

00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:02,555

come up with these traffic
lights in London.

438

Only transgender people
can cross when that's green?

439
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,312
No!

440
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:28,047
When it goes red,
does that mean

441
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:29,516
it's not OK
to be transgender?

442
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:31,551
That's a good point.

443

I don't know what happens
when it goes red.

444
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,788
No way they're gonna say,
"It's not a..." I don't know.

445
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,425
And what has any of this got
to do with crossing the road?

446
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:41,694
That's all you want to do.
It's nothing to do with
expressing your sexuality.

447
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:43,696
It's the wrong time.
I want to cross the road.

448
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,331
All I want to do
at that point

449
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:47,266
is work out how to go
to the other side.

450
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,901

00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,441

Right, now,
can I talk about Alfa Romeo?

456

-Why?

introduce our next film.

Now, as we know, in recent
years the world's carmakers

459
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,723
have made great strides
to make more fuel-efficient

460
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,460
and environmentally-friendly
car engines,

461
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,161
but very little has been
done to make more

462
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,465
environmentally-friendly
car bodies and interiors.

463
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:21,834
Yeah, by and large,
they are still made
of steel and plastic,

464
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,036
and that consumes
a huge amount of energy.

465
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:28,708
So we had an idea. Are there
more sustainable materials
that could be used instead?

466
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:32,645
Well, to find out,
each of us bought
a Land Rover Discovery.

467
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:34,881
We then removed
its metal body

468
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:39,251
and replaced it
with whatever we thought
was the best solution

469

Let me talk you through this.

What I've done, I've built
a frame out of hazel,

479

through which I have weaved
English flowers and shrubs.

480
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,292
It's basically a hedgerow.

481
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,529
Better still, it is growing,
because I've planted them

482
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:25,865
so it's got compost
and soil to provide
the nutrients required

00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,699
planning a new
little hatchback?

504
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:34,166
Now, I hadn't
thought of people.

505
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,468
There's not a lot
of dignity in it, is there?

506
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:38,237
Have you used ears
for wing mirrors?

507
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,672
-Yes.
-You're sick!

508
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:41,941
Why would you not do that?
They're designed for that.

509
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:44,443
-No, they're not.
-Well, they are.

510
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:48,981
-They're not reflective.
-They absorb information and
pass it on to the creature.

511
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,750
-Look at my windscreen.
-What is that?

512
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:52,885
It's...
the digestive system -

513
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:55,622
well, part of the digestive
system - of an cow.

514
00:25:55,622 --> 00:25:56,989
RICHARD: What part
of the digestive system?

515
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,125
-JAMES: Its stomach lining.
-Not its stomach lining.

516
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:00,993
-Well, where? Further back?
-Yes.

517
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,796
Are you staring at the world
through a cow's ring?

518
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,067
It is its anal passage.

519
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:12,538
But it's stretched so thin
that it's completely
transparent.

520
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:14,373
Cow's arse, horse's arse.
It's perfect!

521
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,211
Come on! It's a lot better
than what you two have done,
which is nothing.

522
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:21,948
-What's this made out of?
-Have a guess.
-Is it mud?

523
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,650
It's mud. It's a mud car.

524
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:25,351
-You've got flat tyres.
-No, they're not flat.

525
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,987
They're pumped up
as high as they will go
without exploding.

526
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:29,956
-How much does it weigh?
-Quite a lot.

527
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:31,390
-How much?
-Yeah, loads.

528
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:33,125
How much does it weigh,
James?

529
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,761
-What units would you like?
-Tonnes.

530
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,462
-Five.
-(RICHARD LAUGHS)

531
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:40,366
-Five tonnes?
Well, that's just idiotic.
-Well, mud is quite heavy.

532
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,670
-This looks safe.
-It's sustainable, is that.
That is growing.

533
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:47,239
While we've been having
that conversation, this has
extended a little bit.

534
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,408
-It just grows quietly.
-Is it actually a living car?

535
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:52,912
Everything's planted.
I've put bulbs along here,
ready for spring. Daffodils.

536
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:55,682
-Not safe, though, is it?
-Yes. Hazel, very strong.

537
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:59,786
It's not as strong as bone.
Bone is three times stronger
than steel.

538
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:01,220
-Is it?
-(MESSAGE TONE)

539
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:04,223
Oh. Sorry, text.

540
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,792
Mr Wilman.

541
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:09,762
"Having built your cars
from nature, you will now
drive through it,

542
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:11,263
to the Myarth Hill,

543
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,867
where you will take part in
a green motorsport event."

544
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:17,704
-What green motorsport event?
-He doesn't say.

545
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:21,908
A motorsport event
that is presumably
ecological in some way.

546
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:22,975
OK.

547
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,911
JEREMY: Before setting off,

548
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,613
we consulted a map to see
where we were going.

549
00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:30,116
Right, so that's the UK.

550
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,985
We're here,
and we've got to get to here.

551
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:38,290
Well... that doesn't look
like too much of a challenge.

552
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,493
With that sorted,
we saddled up

553
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,331
and began
our epic 11-mile journey.

554
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:47,834
RICHARD: Look at the smoke!

555
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,501
JEREMY: That's ecological.

556
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:53,339
Greenpeace are gonna be
ringing him up at any moment.

557
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,107
Tremendous.

558
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,777
Smells of nature,
I'm in nature,

559
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:00,246
I'm made of nature.

560
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:05,184
It's not quick,
but it gives me more time
to enjoy God's creation,

561
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,987
of which
I am very much a part.

562
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:10,022
-Oh!
-(LAUGHS)

563
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,359
JEREMY: James!

564
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,227
(JEREMY LAUGHS)

565
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:21,801
We've done ten seconds,
and James... (LAUGHS)

566
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:25,905
I may be losing one of my -
I think the correct technical
term is the A-pillar.

567
00:28:25,972 --> 00:28:27,807
Now it's gone completely.

568
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:29,842
(RICHARD LAUGHS)

569
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:32,945
JEREMY: Oh, dear!
(LAUGHS)

570
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:38,384
Surely
he has to admit defeat?

571
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,586
RICHARD: There's not
much car left now.

572
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,522
JEREMY: Oh, dear, James.

573
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,091
I think we can count you out.

574
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:46,525
-But it doesn't matter.
-What doesn't matter?

575
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,861
Look. You think, "Oh, James's
car's falling apart."

576
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:52,965
I'm standing in my
spare-parts department.
All of it.

577
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:54,633
Can be used
to rebuild your car?

578
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,270
-It's right under there, mud.
-So it's as good as new?
-Sort of.

579
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:01,974
Well, I'm sorry,
but we're gonna set off
and leave you behind.

580
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,509
Well, hang on.
You can't leave me behind

581
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,644
because we haven't started.
We're still in the field.

582
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:06,946
- Oh, yes.
- Good point. OK, well,

583
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:09,448
we're gonna set off
and go to the pub.

584
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:11,383
-That's a very good idea.
-While you...

585
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,286
-While you...
-...find some mud.

586
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:16,823
I've lost my car!
Oh, it's there. It's there.

587
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,359
JEREMY: With Bob The Builder
out of the way,

588
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,561
Richard and I
settled down to appreciate

589
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:27,266
the planet-saving nature of
our revolutionary eco-cars.

590
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,536
You may be...

591
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,038
amused by my bodywork,

592
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,273
or perhaps horrified,

593
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:39,078
but the fact is that
making steel bodies for cars

594
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:45,384
produces 120 million tonnes
of carbon dioxide every year.

595
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,854
120 million tonnes!

596
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:51,891
Carmakers
will sort out clean,

597
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:54,626
environmentally-friendly
engines. They will.

598
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:59,231
But in the meantime, I can
tell you that the CO2
produced by this car's engine

599
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:03,035
is being absorbed
and used by the bodywork.

600
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,573
Plants breathe in
carbon dioxide
and breathe out oxygen.

601
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,910
That's what my car's body
is doing right now.

602
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:12,344
(BLEATING)

603
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:16,916
Jumpers, Sunday lunch...
spare parts.

604
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:19,785
You don't need
a foundry or a furnace

605
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:21,453
to build the body
for this car.

606
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,091
You just need animals
to make love to one another.

607
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,895
That's what this car is
really. It's a sex machine.

608
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:34,934
Meanwhile, back at base,
James was having a rethink.

609
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:37,103
I've decided to abandon
my original idea

610
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,605
because it was just
too weak and too floppy,

611
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,975
and instead I'm going to
build a car out of bricks.

612
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,911
The basic materials
for making the bricks

613
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:47,947
are fresh mud
with a bit of water in it,

614
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:51,517
er... some straw
to give it strength,

615
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,385
and some sheep poo.

616
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:55,955
You then use that
to make the brick shape,

617
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,723
and then you fire those
in a kiln.

618
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,259
Then you use the bricks to
build the thing like a house.

619
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:03,362
Except, of course, it will be
roughly the shape of a car.

620
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:10,236
JEREMY: Back on the road,
Hammond had called
our eco convoy to a halt.

621
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:12,704
-What's the matter?
-Shh.

622
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:13,973
Shush what?

623
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,641
There's a bustle
in my hedgerow.

624
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:19,545
Well, don't be alarmed now.

625
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:24,450
-It's probably just a...
spring clean.
-What, for the May Queen?

626
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,954
RICHARD: As it turned out,
I'd picked up a passenger.

627
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:31,023
Hold on. There! Look!

628
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,591
JEREMY:
Oh! It's a hedgehog!

629
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:34,326
RICHARD: Yeah! He's moved in.

630
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:38,697
Do hedgehogs have bones?
He could be a door mirror.

631
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:41,533
He's now a member of
my little community in here.

632
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,402
You're not using him
to make a door mirror.

633
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:45,604
-No, but when he dies--
-He lives here!

634
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:47,173
Hedgehogs die.

in his little bird box.

00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:15,001
And it's got the biggest
testes I've ever seen!

640
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:20,272
Eventually, Richard and I
arrived at the pub.

That'll never...
You're gonna need pins.

645
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:35,254
Shut up! Your car's
given me hay fever.

646
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:36,788
I can't see through my eyes.

647
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:39,258
Oh, so you crashed your car
because mine's got flowers on

648
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:43,062
and not because you built
your windscreen out of
a cow's balloon knot?

649
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:46,265
Let's not get bogged down
with who caused the accident,
cos it was you.

650
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:48,334
I am now gonna go
and get some spare parts.

651
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,701
Of course you are.
That'll be easy.

652
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:51,670
Maybe there'll be a nice zoo
in this tiny village.

653
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:53,405
No, hospital.
Old folks' home.

654
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:56,042
You could wait--
Just find one of those
old ladies with...

00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,345
JEREMY:
Back at the start point,

657
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:02,414
the eco-warrior was
ramping up the pace.

658
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:23,435
Watch that go.

659
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:27,339
JEREMY:
Meanwhile, back at the pub,

660
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:30,609
I was repairing
my damaged front end.

661
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:34,080
Well, annoyingly,
the pork that I bought

662
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,714
is sort of triangular
and doesn't look right.

663
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:38,284
It doesn't really fit,
so I've got a side of beef,

664
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,152
which I think will be great.

665
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:42,488
Now, I'm just erm...
clearing away the old bone.

I actually think it
looks rather stylish,

673
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:10,216
because it immediately looks
ecological, recyclable,

all those things.

as you can see.

spend the night at the pub.

-How do we know?
We haven't started yet.

The thing is

they always come in the back
of a container lorry,

742

831
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:42,768
The thing is, parking sensors
are very expensive.

832
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,970
You can rent a man
for almost nothing.

833
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:48,306
Yeah, look, I don't know
how much you pay
to rent a man normally,

834
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,241
but I cost more.

835
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:52,210
Now, get me out of here,
please.

836
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:54,980
Well, no, because we've got
to link into the next film.

-We can't get you out anyway

838

we'll never get the bumper off.

839
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:02,220
-You're too good
at your job, Hammond.
RICHARD: Oh, God!

840
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,389
That's what's happened.
So we're going back...

841
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,893
Actually, it's part two,
isn't it? What was the film?

842
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,095
It was Italy.
No, that was last week.

-Oh, the sustainable thing.
-Sustainable cars. So...
-Yes.

we were up bright and early

849
00:42:28,614 --> 00:42:31,016

Oh! That's dogs and foxes
and things, isn't it?

00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:49,701
Dogs have come
and eaten your car. (LAUGHS)

857
00:42:49,768 --> 00:42:51,803
They haven't eaten
it, they've destroyed it,

858
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,706
which means I've got to
put it back together again.

859
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,177
There are some spare parts
up there.

860
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:01,346
JEREMY: Yeah, I think that
horse is looking very ill.

861
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,881
It's got a very grey face.

862
00:43:02,948 --> 00:43:04,650
That's always a sign
of looking ill.

863
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:06,818
Is your horse ill?

864
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:08,053
-No.
-No?

-No
-He'll last the day, then?

866
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:11,322
Yeah.

867

Damn it.

868
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:19,865
It took all morning
to repair my car

869
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,767
with stuff from
the butcher's shop,

870
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,434
which meant it was lunchtime

871
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:25,003
before we were
on our way back

872
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,105
to see how James
was getting on.

873
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:31,977
Jeremy, what's all that smoke
up ahead there?

874
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:34,713
JEREMY: What smoke?

875
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,749
That massive ball of smoke
in front of us, up front.

876
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:39,818
I can't see it.
My hay fever's really bad.

877
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:42,187
No, you can't see it because
you're trying to looking at it

878
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:44,856
through a cow's butt hole.

879
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:47,759
JEREMY: As it turned out,
the smoke was on account

single-handedly restarted
the Industrial Revolution.

(ENGINE STOPS)

00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:12,483
The theory is...
we are reducing our impact
on the environment,

885
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,584
but you've dug it up!

886
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:14,953
It's not where anybody lives.

887
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,722
It's just the countryside.
It's not doing anything.

888
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:18,223
Is that a coal lorry?

889
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:22,027
-Yes.
-The least environmental
thing on the entire earth.

890
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:24,730
It's a lorry delivering coal.

891
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:27,032
-So?
-Why do you need coal?

892
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:29,000
-To fire up the kiln.
-What?

893
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:31,369
The bricks have to be baked.
You can't just--

894
00:44:31,436 --> 00:44:35,440
-Hold on. So you're making
a car out of mud bricks?
-Yes.

895
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,944
Are you gonna dig a canal
network to get in and out,
perhaps, with your coal?

896
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,379
-That's quite a good idea.
-It isn't a good idea!

897
00:44:42,948 --> 00:44:45,283
JEREMY: Much
ruined countryside later,

898
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,987
James's new car
was finally ready.

899
00:44:49,054 --> 00:44:51,823
Why are you dressed up
like an American footballer?

900
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,925
Well, it's a prototype,

901
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:55,994
and I'm a test pilot,
in effect.

902
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:58,329
Test pilots wear
specialist equipment.

903
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,766
But that looks
perfectly solid to me.

904
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:03,769
That roof is...

905
00:45:03,802 --> 00:45:06,872
James, even given
the limitations of the
material you've used,

906
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:08,206
your car looks crap.

907
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:10,141
But look how it blends in
with the environment.

908
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,376

would love this.

with anything.

mystery, to be honest.

00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:37,903
It's not.

918
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:40,471
It had an arched roof,
it had a keystone.

919
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:42,640
There must be something
wrong with that mortar.

JEREMY: Waiting for James
to mend his bodywork, again,

921
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:50,148
meant my bodywork
started to go off.

But, eventually,
he was ready.

It's really rather pleasant.

00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,130
This is like being at home
with the windows open.

926
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:09,100
Richard, meanwhile,
had added some floral
go-faster stripes,

927
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:13,371
and I'd opened up
my cow's rectum
to improve the ventilation.

928
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,176
We have had a few problems.

929
00:46:18,243 --> 00:46:21,913
We've only covered, yes,
two miles in two days,

930
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,015
but here we are,

931
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:26,852
as a threesome, going along.

932
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:34,125
But then...

933
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:36,227
It's a river,
and not a small one.

-Is it?
-Yeah.

939
00:46:57,682 --> 00:47:00,051
JEREMY: Since Richard
is the team bumpkin,

940
00:47:00,118 --> 00:47:02,587
we decided
he should go first.

941
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:07,658
OK, well,
my community of people,
make for higher ground.

942
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:09,560
Just climb.

943
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:13,331
Hammond's ark made it
to the other side safely.

Yeah!

945
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,068
And then it was my go.

946
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:20,438
I'm really deep here.

947
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:21,940
Really, really deep.

948
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:24,209
Oh, no! Cows leak!

949
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:26,577
That's a terrible thing
to learn!

950
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:31,149
However, I, too, made it
with relative ease.

Eat my meat, Hammond!

952
00:47:34,152 --> 00:47:35,921
But then...

00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:37,655
Look at this.

954
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:39,024

Let's look on the bright side.
If this doesn't work
as a car,

957
00:47:46,064 --> 00:47:48,099
it will be very effective
as a dam.

958

quite as quickly as
you or I did it.

959
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,574
Nor as aggressively,
nor as purposefully.

960
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:01,412
His car is also riding a lot
lower than ours because
it weighs so much.

961
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:04,182
I was getting very deep.
It may be leaking slightly.

962
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:08,419
It's leaking a lot.

00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:13,391
Cack.
Chaps, I think I'm beached.

964
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:16,094
I'm being honest,
there's not a great deal
we can do about it.

-The side's just come off.
-Yeah, that's...

What is the point of him?

James, can you hear me?

985
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:08,479
We've analysed the situation
and there is literally

986
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:10,615
nothing we can do to help.
Nothing.

987
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:14,685
Leaving James
in his dissolving car,

988
00:49:14,752 --> 00:49:18,623
we headed off to make camp
and get supper underway.

989
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:22,360
Well, apart from your
rather tragic tents,

990
00:49:22,427 --> 00:49:26,164
-this isn't so bad.
-It's all right.

991
00:49:26,231 --> 00:49:27,765
It is amazing, isn't it?

992
00:49:27,832 --> 00:49:31,202
My car, the way it disappears
into that hedge,

993
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:34,305
it's not just camouflage,
it is hedge.

-It's gone.
-No, it is genuinely...

995

Actually, I will agree,
yours is remarkable.

to get free...

about this -

this sustainable living
we're doing -

this sustainable living
we're doing -
is our barbecue is made
from bricks from James's car,

from bricks from James's car,

vegetables are from your car.

to tell me I'm eating...

-Back wing.
-(RETCHES)

1008
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:22,087
-What?
-When you buy a steak,
it says "keep refrigerated".

1009
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:24,322
It doesn't say, "Stick
to the side of your car,

1010
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:26,324
leave in the sun,
then drive through a river."

1011
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:32,630
Whoa!

1012
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:48,313
James is making
such a racket, isn't he?

1013
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,981
It's worse than last time.

1014
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:55,019
The difference on this trip,
while he's been
tearing nature apart,

1015
00:50:55,086 --> 00:50:57,488
I've never felt closer to it.

1016
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,725
Well, he's just messing
everything up. He always...

It's a hedge trimmer.

-No!

-Why not?
-Because it's going green!

have been on it.

Is this a car? What is it?

1040
00:51:58,816 --> 00:52:03,020
It is a totally sustainable
car made of, effectively,
wattle and daub,

1041
00:52:03,188 --> 00:52:05,022
only the wattle
has been replaced by straw

1042

and the daub has been
replaced by cow poo,

is the same.

-Bats have sonar, don't they?
-Yeah.

1059
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:54,038
So I could use it as a
reversing parking sensor.

once the bat is dead.

There are some issues
associated with

his car back together
using a ball of string...

confuse him now!

Why'd they make it in a ball

But eventually it was done
and we were on our way.

James,
how much does it weigh now?

1078
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:06,877
I'm gonna say the weight
has gone down a bit. I think
I'm down to three tonnes.

1079
00:54:06,944 --> 00:54:09,013
So you still need
an HGV licence?

But it's not a type of car
known to the DVLA.

to smell really bad.

1084

with my microphone,

00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:45,255
Although
we were holding our own,

1164
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:49,193
the relentless pressure
started to take its toll
on our vehicles.

1165
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:52,597
(GRUNTS)

1166
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:55,232
JAMES: I've lost
part of the hat.

1167
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,304
I can smell...

1168
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,939
(SNIFFS) What can I smell?

1169
00:59:03,407 --> 00:59:05,643
Is that from the exhaust?

1170
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:10,014
With Hammond distracted
by the hot exhaust
burning his bodywork,

1171
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,282
it was all down
to my cow car.

1172
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:20,791
Good dicing here between
the past and the future.

1173
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:23,227
It's neck and neck!

1174
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:24,428
(LAUGHS)

1175
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:26,130
But then...

1176
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:27,632
Oh, no! No!

1177
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:29,900
Disaster!

1178
00:59:29,967 --> 00:59:31,702
Oh, hell.
I think it looks like

1179
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:32,970
Jeremy's got trouble.

1180
00:59:34,939 --> 00:59:36,641
How do you peel a cow?

1181
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:41,045
Having eventually got to
the overheating engine

1182
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:45,249
and seen it had become
a production line
for maggots...

1183
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:47,818
...I decided to go off
and be sick.

1184
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:56,160
Er... News from the Inaugural
Sustainable Motorsport Event

1185
00:59:56,226 --> 00:59:58,562
On A Sustainable Track,
or whatever it's called,

1186
00:59:58,663 --> 01:00:02,032
Jeremy Clarkson has retired
with a maggot infestation.

1187
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:07,271
JAMES: This meant
all our hopes rested
with Richard Hammond

1188
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:08,939
and his smouldering ark.

1189
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:13,678
Yeah, you ran wide!

1190
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:15,512
But then...

1191
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:16,881
Oh, my God!

1192
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:19,684
Oh, no!

1193
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:26,123
Oh, no! More news from the
Sustainable Motorsport
Challenge is that... Ow!

1194
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:29,326
...Richard Hammond,
I believe, is on fire.

1195
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:31,028
The garden centre is ablaze.

1196
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,132
Oh, God! Oh, no! Oh, no!

1197
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:38,803
That's gonna make it worse!

1198
01:00:40,004 --> 01:00:41,038
(GROANS)

1199
01:00:41,105 --> 01:00:43,007
JEREMY: With Hammond's car
on fire...

1200
01:00:44,441 --> 01:00:48,445
mine alive, and James's
disintegrating again...

1201
01:00:48,512 --> 01:00:50,147
JAMES: Ow! Ow!

1202
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:54,251
...we decided that
environmentalism
simply doesn't work.

1203
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,055
-And with that, back to--
-(SIREN BLARES)

1204
01:00:58,122 --> 01:01:00,290
And with that,
back to the tent.

1205
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:04,194
JAMES: Holy crap!

1206
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:08,098
(CHEERING)

1207
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,203
-No, it didn't work.
-No. So, there we are.

1208
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,107
There we are,
we've looked into it.

1209
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,575
We've looked into it
thoroughly,

1210
01:01:18,642 --> 01:01:22,079
and I'm afraid
we're all doomed,
we're all gonna die.

1211
01:01:22,146 --> 01:01:25,649
And on that terrible
disappointment,
I'm afraid it's time to end.

1212
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,251
See you next week. Goodbye!

1213
01:01:27,317 --> 01:01:28,418
