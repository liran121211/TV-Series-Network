8
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:20,811
which this week
comes from Germany!

9
00:01:21,734 --> 00:01:25,672
Ja. We're here. We're here.

10
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:31,397
Specifically... Specifically, we
are in the city of Stuttgart.

11
00:01:31,514 --> 00:01:33,461
Except we nearly weren't.

12
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:36,746
Because one of your
local Green politicians

13
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,152
tried to ban us
from coming here.

14
00:01:39,246 --> 00:01:41,707
I don't want to embarrass
the poor man on television.

15
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:44,137
So I've hidden his identity. Um!

16
00:01:47,762 --> 00:01:49,277
Yeah.

17
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:51,044
- Yeah.
- That's good.

18
00:01:51,473 --> 00:01:54,035
That's appropriate.

19
00:01:54,784 --> 00:01:57,238
I certainly don't want to
tell you his name.

20
00:01:57,308 --> 00:02:01,183
Which is... Andreas Kasdorf.

21
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,525
Uh...

22
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:07,223
Not a popular man.
But you elected him.

23
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:10,223
Anyway, he says that
we'd be unwelcome here

24
00:02:10,316 --> 00:02:13,879
because this is a very
bicycle-friendly place.

25
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:18,621
It... It isn't. It's the home
of Mercedes and Porsche.

26
00:02:18,754 --> 00:02:21,738
- And Germany... -
- Exactly.

27
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:24,465
Germany...

28
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:28,949
Germany is the cradle
of the automobile.

29
00:02:29,051 --> 00:02:31,332
The car was
actually invented here.

30
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:34,012
It's the last place on Earth
you can drive a car

31
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:36,798
as fast as it will go
on the motorway.

32
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,894
- It's true.
- All true.

33
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:42,863
This is a true fact.
This is a true fact.

34
00:02:42,948 --> 00:02:45,269
The Germans are
the only people on Earth

35
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:48,589
who really know
how to make a car.

36
00:02:48,698 --> 00:02:49,949
This is...

37
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:52,997
- It's a true fact.
- It's true.

38
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:54,659
I'll tell you a story.

39
00:02:54,738 --> 00:02:56,387
There was a Mercedes engineer

40
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,238
and a Jaguar engineer
having dinner one night.

41
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,277
The Mercedes engineer
said, "Ve haf..."

42
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:02,848
Forgive the accent.

43
00:03:03,285 --> 00:03:06,504
"Ve haf a quality test
at ze Mercedes factory."

44
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,863
Every night, ve take a car
off ze line at random.

45
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,051
Ve put a cat in it,
close ze doors.

46
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,394
If... When ve come back
in ze morning,

47
00:03:15,605 --> 00:03:18,277
ve know the door seals
are vorking correctly

48
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:20,067
"if ze cat has suffocated."

49
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:24,386
Nah.

50
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,871
The Jaguar engineer said,

51
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,723
"We've got something very
similar at our factory."

52
00:03:29,824 --> 00:03:31,840
We take a car
off the line at random.

53
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:34,293
We put a cat in it.
We close the door.

54
00:03:34,418 --> 00:03:36,238
And we know the car's
been built properly

55
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:39,722
if, when we come back in the
morning, the cat hasn't escaped.

56
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:42,073
That is...

57
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:45,025
- True story.
- Yeah. True story.

58
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,910
The strange thing is,

59
00:03:47,012 --> 00:03:48,933
it isn't just cars
that are built well here.

60
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:52,129
- It's absolutely everything.
- Except wine.

61
00:03:52,262 --> 00:03:54,238
Yes, except wine. Sorry.

62
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:55,589
Well, come on!

63
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,917
- Now come on!
- You drink that stuff?

64
00:03:57,957 --> 00:03:59,379
Yeah.

65
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,308
I wouldn't wash my hair in it.

66
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,691
Are you sure?

67
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:04,247
No. It is literally everything,
though.

68
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:05,715
I mean, German soft toys,

69
00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:07,668
better than anybody
else's soft toys.

70
00:04:07,738 --> 00:04:10,144
Cameras, kitchen appliances.

71
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,520
The Queen of England,
she's German.

72
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:14,746
She is. That's why
she's still working

73
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:17,758
even though she's a hundred
and forty seventeen years old.

74
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:20,629
There is no word here
for "that'll do".

75
00:04:20,691 --> 00:04:23,931
There is no ambiguity
at all in Germany.

76
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,129
You certainly see this
with films. Okay!

77
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:28,644
The names you have
for American films.

78
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:31,574
I've got some here.
Remember Airplane?

79
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:33,183
- Airplane...
- Yes.

80
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:35,152
In Germany, it was called

81
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,863
the Unbelievable Journey
In The Crazy Airplane.

82
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:40,988
That is a comprehensive title.

83
00:04:41,152 --> 00:04:42,339
- You know where you are with that.
- Yeah.

84
00:04:42,363 --> 00:04:43,951
What was Jaws?

85
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,183
The what? The Weisse...?

86
00:04:47,363 --> 00:04:48,840
The White Shark.

87
00:04:48,965 --> 00:04:50,800
It should have been
The Massive Shark

88
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:53,361
That Explodes Eventually.

89
00:04:53,613 --> 00:04:55,324
You know where
you're going with that.

90
00:04:55,446 --> 00:04:58,253
What was...
What was Basic Instinct?

91

Just not, a brief glimpse of
Sharon Stone's Vagina?

92
00:05:02,237 --> 00:05:03,972
Yes. Right.
Shall we get on with the show?

93
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:05,176
Yes. Good idea.

103

But before all that,
I'd like to talk

104
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:24,792
about the original Honda NSX.

105
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:26,494
We have a picture of it here.

106
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,957
When that car
was launched in 1990,

107
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:31,004
it was considered remarkable

108
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,637
because it was fast
and exciting like a Ferrari,

109
00:05:33,723 --> 00:05:36,090
but unlike a Ferrari
of the time,

110
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:38,449
it was also incredibly reliable

111
00:05:38,543 --> 00:05:40,465
and very, very easy to drive.

112
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:42,824
Honda killed that car off
12 years ago.

113
00:05:42,902 --> 00:05:45,715
But finally, they've come up
with a replacement.

114
00:05:45,816 --> 00:05:49,417
So I've been down to our
track... to see what it's like.

115
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,473
This is it.

116
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,146
It costs £138,000.

117
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,430
Around the same
as a Porsche 911 Turbo S.

118
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,589
And it has the futuristic lines

119
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:08,464
you would expect
of a rare-breed Honda.

120
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:13,808
Power comes from
a 3.5 litre Twin-Turbo V6.

121
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:17,785
Backed up by a squadron
of electric motors.

122
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:23,745
Together, they give
the NSX 573 horsepower.

123
00:06:24,714 --> 00:06:26,683
So you would assume
the performance

124
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,519
is something to shout about.

125
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:31,831
Now, if you ask Honda

126
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:33,620
for the technical
information on this car,

127
00:06:33,652 --> 00:06:36,464
they will email you
a file so enormous

128
00:06:36,636 --> 00:06:38,433
that it actually
breaks the internet.

129
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:42,027
And yet, nowhere in it does
it mention the 0-60 time.

130
00:06:42,074 --> 00:06:44,636
They simply refuse
to tell us what it is.

131
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:48,127
I know 0-60 times are
irrelevant in the real world

132
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:50,753
and they're rather childish,
but look, this is a supercar.

133
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:53,167
It's top trumps, isn't it?
It's important.

134
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:56,597
So I'm gonna find out what
it is for you using this.

135
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:58,852
It is a data-o-logger.

136
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,105
Right. Put it in Track mode.

137
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:06,902
Here we go. Launch control.

138
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:09,152
Foot on the brake.
Mash the pedal.

139
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:18,732
Phwoarh!

140
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:24,769
I'm not sure that was
quite as neck-snapping

141
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:25,816
as a Nissan GTR,

142
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,781
but it wasn't far off.

143
00:07:28,183 --> 00:07:29,909
Let's see what I did.

144
00:07:32,206 --> 00:07:35,295
3.2 seconds 0-60.

145
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:41,667
Which means... it isn't quite
as fast as a McLaren 570S,

146
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:44,532
or a 911 Turbo S,

147
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:47,214
or a Ferrari 488 GTB.

148
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:48,995
That's why they're
not mentioning it.

149
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:53,370
Honda is happy
to quote the top speed.

150
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,601
Which is 191 miles an hour.

151
00:07:57,902 --> 00:07:59,636
But that too is slower
than its rivals

152
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,925
from Ferrari, Porsche,
and McLaren.

153
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:09,730
So has the new NSX got anything

154
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:10,948
in the performance department

155
00:08:10,972 --> 00:08:14,519
that makes it rise above
its supercar peers?

156
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,238
Well, yes, actually.

157
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:21,066
Firstly, there are the brakes,
which are fly-by-wire.

158
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:23,355
There is no physical
connection to the pedal.

159
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:25,784
That's because they
have to harvest energy

160
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,542
to recharge the battery system.

161
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:29,347
It's a much cleverer
version of that

162
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:31,190
than you get on the Porsche 918,

163
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:33,956
a car that costs
five times as much.

164
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:35,393
Then there's the hybrid system.

165
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:37,261
It uses not one electric motor,

166
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,284
as you might expect, but three.

167
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:43,144
And the way it uses them...
is well good.

168
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:47,183
♪♪

169
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:48,284
The one at the back

170
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:50,269
is the wingman
for the petrol engine,

171
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,601
filling the power gaps
when the turbos lag.

172
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:58,792
This gives the NSX ballistic
pick-up at any speed.

173
00:09:01,386 --> 00:09:04,706
Look, instant shove.
It's lovely.

174
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:14,644
But it's the two at the front
that are the real party-piece

175
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:16,839
because they drive a wheel

176
00:09:16,941 --> 00:09:19,394
each totally independently
of each other.

177
00:09:19,488 --> 00:09:21,402
Which means this car has

178
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,409
a sort of space-age
four-wheel drive.

179
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:28,667
And that means
extraordinary things happen

180
00:09:28,753 --> 00:09:30,824
when you throw it into a corner.

181
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:39,441
So, as you approach
a corner like this one,

182
00:09:39,566 --> 00:09:41,511
computers are
measuring the speed,

183
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,995
they're measuring G-force,
steering input, and so forth.

184
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:46,644
They're adding power
to the wheel

185
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:49,394
or taking power away from
the wheel as it's needed.

186
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:54,222
Then you get perfectly flat,
perfectly controlled corners.

187
00:09:55,331 --> 00:09:57,971
It is a bit like
driving a Honda Civic!

188
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:01,291
There are people who would say

189
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:03,550
that... technology
like this in a car,

190
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:06,120
helping it feel secure,
will make it dull.

191
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:07,941
But it doesn't feel dull to me.

192
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:09,792
It feels tremendous.

193
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:13,824
I'm going fast and I'm relaxing.

194
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,749

But the futuristic
four-wheel drive

isn't the only piece of
23rd-century engineering

198

on the NSX.

199
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:28,604
The aerodynamics,
for example, are so clever,

200
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,800
they can cool all the motors

201
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:34,308
while providing vast amounts
of grip-enhancing downforce

202
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:37,058
to the front and rear wheels.

It's not just the technology,

it's that that technology
is on this car.

211
00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:04,925
Yes, we have hybrid supercars.

212
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:07,134
We have the LaFerrari,
the McLaren P1,

213
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,601
the Porsche 918.

214
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,730
But they're in the
million-pound bracket.

215
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:14,613
This is only an eighth
of the price of the LaFerrari,

216
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:16,909
and it's actually cleverer.

217
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:19,490
I love this.

218
00:11:19,565 --> 00:11:22,644
I love the way it looks.
I love the sounds it makes.

219
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:25,167
I like the sophistication
of the hybrid drive.

220
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,644
I like the performance.

And I find myself
wanting one quite badly.

224
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:40,409
The original NSX made
owning a supercar

225
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,245
less painful and less expensive.

226
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:47,863
This has done the same
for the hybrid supercar.

227
00:11:47,995 --> 00:11:52,152
It really is a worthy successor.

James, Honda...

229
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:10,480
Honda took ten years
to develop that car.

230
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:11,558
And?

231
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,847
Ten years is an enormous
amount of time

232
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:14,980
to do a car.

233
00:12:15,074 --> 00:12:16,456
You can't criticise something

234
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,769
because people spent
too long on it.

People aren't gonna say "I'm not
gonna look round Cologne Cathedral."

They took 600 years
to build it!"

Ooh.

238
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,414
Anyway, I love it.
I love that car.

239
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,058
Anyway, look, we've heard

240
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:30,706
what you've got to say
about the NSX.

241
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:32,699
Now it's time to hand it over

242
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:34,316
to a man who thinks that...

243
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:37,175
Well, potted plants
are a Communist plot.

244
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:40,464
Yep. Here he comes.
It's the American!

245
00:12:43,856 --> 00:12:48,501
Come to England.
Shit weather. Shit beer.

246
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:50,570
And he's off!

247
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:53,396
Clearly in a tremendous mood.

Wipers flapping away

253
00:13:03,127 --> 00:13:05,220
this thing's badge
is inaccurate.

254
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:07,470
Kind of like a loser's Cadillac.

255
00:13:07,627 --> 00:13:09,588
And yet, strangely,
we're still waiting

256
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:12,119
for Cadillac's hybrid supercar.

257
00:13:12,306 --> 00:13:14,697
Right, now,
flying into Your Name Here,

258
00:13:14,783 --> 00:13:17,767
this really is a good day
to have four-wheel drive.

259
00:13:17,892 --> 00:13:20,150
I'm sure even the American
can appreciate

260
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:22,314
the Honda's
hi-tech features.

261
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,158

Right, full power
for the Isn't again.

264
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,392
Electric ain't for engines.
It's for lights and chairs.

00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:36,183
He is not a modern man, is he?

266
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,705
Right, carving through
the standing water.

267
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:40,588
Into Old Lady's House.

Slithering about a bit.

269
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:46,010
And now, he's leaning on it
for the Unsettled section.

270
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:48,853
Past the hangars

Through Field Of Sheep,

276
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:01,315
keeping it tidy through
there, and across the line!

277
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:12,572
Right,

- Not the same.
- a smoggy day.

316
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,541
Can I just ask,
what would you have done

317
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,181
if they'd have actually ordered
you not to drive cars?

it's an advisory.

Once something becomes

325
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,556
I once had a very
interesting conversation

326
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:32,469
with two friends of mine.

327
00:16:32,494 --> 00:16:35,064
One is from California
and one is from Germany.

328
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,537
We were talking about
losing your driving licence.

329
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:40,877
The Californian said, "In
Germany, what would happen"

330
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,705
if you lost your licence
and then you drove your car?"

331
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,738
The German said,
"No, you cannot do this."

332
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:50,244
And he says, "I know
you're not supposed to",

333
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:51,611
but what if you did?"

334
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:54,306
He said, "No. You cannot
drive. You have no licence."

335
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,157
The Californian
went, "Yeah, man",

336
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:58,908
"but late one night, you just...

337
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,400
hell, you go for a drive."

338
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:02,119
The German went,
"It is impossible

339
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,744
to drive without a licence!"

340
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,439
- Impossible!
- Impossible.

341
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,829
Actually, there's an interesting thing
I discovered here.

342
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:17,595
On a motorway, okay, obviously you
can drive as fast as you like.

343
00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:19,142
You get people
sometimes, not often,

344
00:17:19,252 --> 00:17:20,963
cos your lane discipline
is unbelievable,

345
00:17:21,064 --> 00:17:24,564
but sometimes they sit in the
outside lane just dawdling.

346
00:17:24,705 --> 00:17:28,369
If you tailgate them... OK?
I've got the fines here.

347
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:32,197
You get a 400 Euro fine,
two penalty points,

348
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:35,002
and a three-month ban
for tailgating.

349
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:36,588
- That is extreme. Ouch!
- Yes.

350
00:17:36,729 --> 00:17:38,807
But-But if you overtake them
on the inside,

351
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:40,588
just go past them on the inside,

352
00:17:40,635 --> 00:17:43,705
that's a 150 Euro fine,
and one point.

353
00:17:43,853 --> 00:17:45,338
- Yeah.
- None. That...

354
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:47,658
No. This is where
it gets really good.

355
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:51,238
If you go on the hard shoulder
to overtake, the emergency lane,

356
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:55,608
that's also one point
but only a 90 euro fine.

357
00:17:55,845 --> 00:17:58,486
There's your answer.
That's what you do!

358
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:01,174
No, no.

359
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:06,752
No, because... Aha.
You may think that.

360
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,072
But if you fit your car
with blue lights,

361
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,853
flashing blue lights, basically,

362
00:18:10,939 --> 00:18:12,908
you turn you car
into a police car,

363
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,931
you get... I've got
the point fines here.

364
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,580
20 Euro fine
and no points at all!

365
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,513
What? You're joking!

366
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:26,970
- No, you don't understand.
- That is true.

367
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:29,244
That is very strange
to our ears.

368
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,126
Cos if you tried that
at home in the UK,

369
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,447
you would be charged with

370
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:35,016
- impersonating a police officer,
- You understand...

371
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,540
and you would never
get out of prison, ever.

372
00:18:37,603 --> 00:18:40,681
No, to me, people say Germans
have no sense of humour.

373
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:42,751
If you want to know
what no sense of humour is,

374
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,790
impersonate a policeman
in Britain.

375
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:46,970
Then you'll know
what no sense of humour is.

376
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:50,205
Right, that is the end
of Conversation Strasse.

377
00:18:54,306 --> 00:18:57,884
Now, we all like the idea of
a sports utility vehicle.

378
00:18:57,955 --> 00:19:00,845
A car that can handle the
Australian outback at the weekend

379
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:05,011
and then set a new lap record at
Hockenheim on a Monday morning.

380
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,447
But even the German
car-makers

381
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:09,540
can't seem to make
the concept work.

382
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,009
We've got this from Audi.
The RS Q3.

383
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,837
Which is a dismal car.

384
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:16,736
BMW have the X4,
I think that's called.

385
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:17,931
Don't want one of those, either.

386
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:20,509
Mercedes have
this horrible monster.

387
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,775
So, they're all just rubbish.

388
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:25,415
And let me guess.
You have a solution.

389
00:19:25,525 --> 00:19:26,699
- Yes, I do.
- Oh, God.

390
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,665
Yes, I do. A car

391
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,908
that is both sporty
and utilitarian.

392
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,281
This will be good.

393
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:35,939
Ye of little faith.
Watch this.

394
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:41,758
This is a Land Rover Discovery

395
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,650
doing utilitarian things

396
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,531
in Britain's muddy underbelly.

397
00:19:49,172 --> 00:19:51,758
And obviously
a machine like this

398
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:56,110
cannot possibly be
converted into a sports car.

399
00:19:58,726 --> 00:20:00,761
Or can it?

400
00:20:03,063 --> 00:20:07,016
First of all, we have to remove
this rather ungainly body.

401
00:20:07,094 --> 00:20:09,219
You can't do that
with a modern car

402
00:20:09,313 --> 00:20:12,336
because the body is the
chassis. It's the skeleton...

403
00:20:12,422 --> 00:20:15,227
If you take it away,
you're left with nothing more

404
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:17,321
than a collection
of unjoined-up parts.

405
00:20:17,453 --> 00:20:19,492
However, you can remove the body

406
00:20:19,571 --> 00:20:20,899
on an old Discovery like this,

407
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:24,250
using nothing more
than one of these.

408
00:20:30,989 --> 00:20:32,481
After just 40 minutes

409
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,653
with no help from anyone else,

410
00:20:34,754 --> 00:20:37,762
I ended up with this.

411
00:20:43,402 --> 00:20:46,738
Obviously
it's still utilitarian.

412
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:48,622
It will still wade
through rivers

413
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,700
and... crawl its way
up muddy banks.

414
00:20:51,982 --> 00:20:53,575
But now there's a...

415
00:20:53,724 --> 00:20:55,904
a sporty flavour as well.

416
00:20:57,747 --> 00:21:02,732
Without the heavy body, it
feels nimble, agile, light.

417
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:10,637
If it weren't for the fact that the
windscreen is now very close to my face,

418
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:14,060
it would feel like
a Lamborghini Gallardo.

419
00:21:17,224 --> 00:21:19,036
The only real problem with this

420
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:21,530
is that Britain
is a police state,

421
00:21:21,607 --> 00:21:23,365
and if I took this
on a public road,

422
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,857
I'd be stopped immediately

423
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:28,146
by the constabulary
who would point out

424
00:21:28,193 --> 00:21:30,372
that I was contravening about...

425
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:34,200
4,870 different laws.

426
00:21:38,104 --> 00:21:40,232
It's not warm, either.

427
00:21:40,435 --> 00:21:42,552
Oh, no, that's stupid!

428
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:45,364
Happily, both these
problems would be solved

429
00:21:45,426 --> 00:21:49,075
when I fitted it with
the body from a sports car.

430
00:21:51,848 --> 00:21:55,247
And this is the sports car
I've gone for.

431
00:21:56,629 --> 00:22:00,434
A 1978 MGB.

432
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,684
Highly-trained men
are now removing its skin

433
00:22:06,754 --> 00:22:08,340
which will then be mated

434
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,372
in a delicate two-hour
operation...

435
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:14,967
to the internal organs

436
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:17,379
of the mud-plugging V8.

437
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:20,540
The following morning

438
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,372
my incredible car was ready.

439
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:36,325
It is incredible

440
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:40,301
that in a shed I have created
something which has...

441
00:22:40,465 --> 00:22:44,715
eluded the combined might
of the motor industry.

442
00:22:45,036 --> 00:22:49,178
It is a proper
sports utility vehicle.

443
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:51,241
I call it the MGD,

444
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:53,647
and now I'm going to find out

445
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,389
how well it works on a road.

446
00:23:06,476 --> 00:23:10,053
This is... magnificent.

447
00:23:12,405 --> 00:23:16,108
And it is quick. Oh, yeah.

448
00:23:17,904 --> 00:23:19,889
To demonstrate just how quick,

449
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:21,499
I'm going to do a drag race

450
00:23:21,616 --> 00:23:23,655
against the motor
industry's idea

451
00:23:23,877 --> 00:23:25,553
of an SUV.

452
00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:33,968
Little bit of play there.

453
00:23:38,454 --> 00:23:40,456
Let's do this.

454
00:23:43,693 --> 00:23:46,530
Come on! Yes, look at this.

455
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:50,875
The 1.5-litre diesel...

456
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:57,034
is no match
for the 3.9-litre V8 MGD.

457
00:23:59,028 --> 00:24:01,894
Come on, Pride of Britain!

458
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,877
Yes! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

459
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:08,142
Ah... ah... ah.

460
00:24:08,493 --> 00:24:10,118
Oh, God.

461
00:24:10,386 --> 00:24:12,588
The brakes don't work.

462
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,829
With the performance box ticked,

463
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,027
I continued my testing.

464
00:24:21,431 --> 00:24:25,298
In many ways,
the MGD puts me in mind

465
00:24:25,368 --> 00:24:27,618
of an Audi R8 Spyder.

466
00:24:28,665 --> 00:24:31,962
I mean, OK, in the Audi,
the dials would work.

467
00:24:32,118 --> 00:24:34,884
And the switches.
And the brakes.

468
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:36,798
And the steering.

469
00:24:37,118 --> 00:24:39,353
And it's a bit less
bouncy, but...

470
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,986
both of them

471
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:43,642
are four-wheel-drive,
two-seater,

472
00:24:43,736 --> 00:24:46,418
drop-head V8s.

473
00:24:46,553 --> 00:24:48,603
There is, however,
one very big difference

474
00:24:48,743 --> 00:24:50,861
between the two cars.

475
00:24:51,204 --> 00:24:53,095
You can't do this in an Audi.

476
00:25:00,103 --> 00:25:02,835
Oh, yes. Yes.

477
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:07,236
Moments ago I was haring
round a handling track,

478
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,728
and now look.

479
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,392
It's brilliant.

480
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:19,192
Oh, no! Not now, you bastard.

481
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,121
I mean, you wonderful thing.

482
00:25:22,505 --> 00:25:24,247
Choke. Oh.

483
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
Yeah, that...

484
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:30,567
It's on its shutdown thing.

485
00:25:30,754 --> 00:25:31,921
It's just to save fuel,

486
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:34,286
it goes on two cylinders
sometimes.

487
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,872
Once the engine management
thingy had run its...

488
00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:41,622
diagnostic program,

489
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:43,770
I was back on the move.

490
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:45,485
Here we go.

491
00:25:48,692 --> 00:25:50,082
Yes.

492
00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:54,253
Mighty four-wheel-drive
system hauling me up that.

493
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,689
What the hell?

494
00:25:56,927 --> 00:25:59,645
Argh! Aargh!

495
00:26:00,044 --> 00:26:02,294
I'm stopping. Stopping.

496
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:08,716
Oh, Lord,
that is not right, is it?

497
00:26:16,653 --> 00:26:18,552
As I got going
for the second time,

498
00:26:18,755 --> 00:26:21,325
I realised
I'd been a bit of a chump.

499
00:26:21,544 --> 00:26:22,849
The mistake I've made,
of course,

500
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,755
is that I've... introduced
you to this car

501
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:27,200
before I've really tested it.

502
00:26:27,255 --> 00:26:29,317
That's not
what car-makers do.

503
00:26:29,418 --> 00:26:31,449
They test a car and then show it

504
00:26:31,513 --> 00:26:34,239
to the... the press and the public.

505
00:26:34,614 --> 00:26:36,059
I'm doing that
the other way round.

506
00:26:36,145 --> 00:26:38,130
I'm introducing this to you

507
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,317
before I've done
the testing and...

508
00:26:44,388 --> 00:26:46,763
Oh, for Christ's sake.

509
00:26:50,763 --> 00:26:52,856
You little beauty.

510
00:26:57,851 --> 00:27:01,208
Er, now, yes, what was I saying?

511
00:27:03,114 --> 00:27:07,638
I think the issue is really you're
watching my workings-out here.

512
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,340
What you really want to see
is the finished product.

513
00:27:10,364 --> 00:27:12,198
That's what I should have done.

514
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:15,239
Oh, Christ's sake.

515
00:27:17,263 --> 00:27:18,849
Right.

516
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:23,411
At this point, I decided,
for no particular reason,

517
00:27:23,505 --> 00:27:25,712
to scrap the MG idea

518
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:28,216
and go for
something else instead.

519
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,356
♪♪

520
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:33,731
This is what I chose.

521
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:36,856
A 1980s Mercedes SL.

522
00:27:37,052 --> 00:27:39,286
Partly because
it's the very essence

523
00:27:39,427 --> 00:27:41,200
of quiet, urban restraint,

524
00:27:41,246 --> 00:27:42,847
taste and elegance.

525
00:27:42,981 --> 00:27:47,199
It's a car that was driven
by Bobby Ewing in Dallas.

526
00:27:47,442 --> 00:27:49,368
Mostly, though,
I chose it because

527
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:53,114
it would fit more snugly
on the Discovery chassis.

528
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,739
This time,
the men worked tirelessly

529
00:27:58,825 --> 00:28:00,184
for nearly a whole day

530
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:01,700
to marry the two cars

531
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:04,989
and the result... was spectacular.

532
00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:11,911
It's a car
I have justifiably called...

533
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:14,093
The Excellent.

534
00:28:14,395 --> 00:28:17,474
The internal organs
from a Landrover Discovery

535
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:22,802
mated to the beautiful skin
of a glamorous Mercedes SL.

536
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:25,638
To create a vision of pure...

537
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,567
What's the word?

538
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,934
- OTHERS: Rubbish.
- It's not rubbish.

539
00:28:30,005 --> 00:28:33,192
Did you paint it
with a brush or a bucket?

540
00:28:33,317 --> 00:28:36,114
It's got those headlights that
swivel when you go round a bend.

541
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:37,649
So they point at the road.

542
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:39,606
OK, let me ask you this.

543
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:40,927
Which would you rather have?

544
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,083
The Excellent or that Porsche?

545
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,224
BOTH: That Porsche.
- Why?

546
00:28:45,372 --> 00:28:47,994
Because it's better
in every single way.

547
00:28:48,302 --> 00:28:50,583
To prove my cynical
colleagues wrong,

548
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:53,032
I invited them
to go for a drive.

549
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,419
Oh, kind.

550
00:28:56,488 --> 00:28:59,605
See? It's an optional extra
for the shorter gentleman.

551
00:28:59,996 --> 00:29:02,418
- Are you comfy, Hammond?
- No.

552
00:29:02,652 --> 00:29:05,394
- Is this as in as I can get?
- Yep.

553
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:09,305
- Woh!
- Right, listen to this.

554
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:13,191
Oh, no, it moves!

555
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:19,941
We'd only gone a few miles
before Richard and James

556
00:29:20,043 --> 00:29:21,808
completely changed their minds

557
00:29:21,902 --> 00:29:24,855
and realised that The
Excellent was the best car

558
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:26,425
they'd ever been in.

559
00:29:26,573 --> 00:29:28,035
No, we haven't.
Stop saying things

560
00:29:28,082 --> 00:29:29,918
in voiceover that aren't true.

561
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,200
I thought you'd
changed your mind.

562
00:29:31,224 --> 00:29:33,902
No! Maybe a bit.
It's worse than I thought.

563
00:29:34,113 --> 00:29:36,394
- Can I put the heater on?
- That's not connected.

564
00:29:36,601 --> 00:29:37,868
- Is it not?
- No.

565
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,660
- What's that dial down there?
- Speedometer.

566
00:29:40,855 --> 00:29:42,425
Why have you got that one,
not that one?

567
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,066
- That doesn't work.
- Has it got a fuel gauge?

568
00:29:45,277 --> 00:29:47,408
- Not as such.
- Has it got a temperature gauge?

569
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:48,486
Not really.

570
00:29:48,511 --> 00:29:50,589
There's a lot of wires
hanging out of the dash

571
00:29:50,675 --> 00:29:51,955
that aren't connected to things.

572
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:54,496
You haven't given it
an interior.

573
00:29:57,294 --> 00:29:59,847
- I can see the road.
- I can as well.

574
00:29:59,878 --> 00:30:02,800
No, there's a hole in the floor.

575
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,527
While Hammond and May had
one or two minor issues,

576
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:10,152
they both agreed that if I were
to put my car into production,

577
00:30:10,285 --> 00:30:12,511
it would make me a fortune.

578
00:30:12,589 --> 00:30:15,003
No, we didn't agree
to that, either.

579
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,996
Look, I've
done the maths. Honestly.

580
00:30:17,121 --> 00:30:18,902
The Discovery was £2,500.

581
00:30:19,043 --> 00:30:22,433
Mercedes £4,500.
£7,000 for the work.

582
00:30:22,535 --> 00:30:26,418
That's 14,000 quid. I could
sell this for £120,000.

583
00:30:26,636 --> 00:30:28,127
- No, you couldn't.
- Yes, I could.

584
00:30:28,152 --> 00:30:30,222
A Cayenne Turbo is 120.

585
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:34,207
A Cayenne Turbo is a proper
car built by Porsche.

586
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:37,803
This is two scrap cars
glued together by a Muppet.

587
00:30:37,996 --> 00:30:40,128
It isn't designed
for people like you.

588
00:30:40,284 --> 00:30:42,370
What, people with eyes?

589
00:30:42,566 --> 00:30:44,464
People who can dress
themselves in the morning?

590
00:30:44,527 --> 00:30:47,378
I'll tell you exactly
who will buy this car.

591
00:30:47,449 --> 00:30:50,050
People who use
roundy-ended scissors.

592
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,510
Footballers.

593
00:30:51,535 --> 00:30:53,753
- No, they won't.
- Footballers like Ferraris.

594
00:30:53,871 --> 00:30:55,566
Yeah, and Bentleys
and Range Rovers.

595
00:30:55,699 --> 00:30:58,113
- And Aston Martins.
- Not this thing.

596
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:05,433
To prove them wrong again,

597
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,097
I decided to head for the
nearby Chelsea training ground.

598
00:31:10,972 --> 00:31:14,105
These are people who understand
cars, not like you two.

599
00:31:14,222 --> 00:31:16,331
Yeah, they understand
cars, that's why they buy

600
00:31:16,355 --> 00:31:18,660
Range Rovers and Aston Martins.

601
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,955
They buy those things

602
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:22,472
cos they didn't know
that you could do this.

603
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:25,089
- I like my car.
- It's shit.

604
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,238
They're flocking to it,
aren't they?

605
00:31:32,371 --> 00:31:33,959
- You just watch.
- Do you mind

606
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,363
if I go and stand
next to something else?

607
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:39,496
Soon some players arrived,

608
00:31:39,628 --> 00:31:41,633
which gave Richard
and James a chance

609
00:31:41,746 --> 00:31:44,183
to show off their
footballing knowledge.

610
00:31:44,357 --> 00:31:46,425
You're really tall.
You should play in goal.

611
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:47,777
Yeah, I do, I play in goal.

612
00:31:47,863 --> 00:31:49,136
- I'm the goalkeeper.
- I know that.

613
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,050
What part of Chelsea
are you from?

614
00:31:51,207 --> 00:31:54,316
- I'm from Belgium.
- Oh.

615
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,480
How do you know
they're footballers?

616
00:31:56,737 --> 00:31:58,207
Well, do you not recognise them?

617
00:31:58,425 --> 00:31:59,878
They're in football outfits...

618
00:31:59,971 --> 00:32:01,174
He doesn't recognise you.

619
00:32:01,394 --> 00:32:03,175
Where's...
Where's Alex Ferguson?

620
00:32:03,246 --> 00:32:05,391
Why don't we ask him?

621
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:08,675
At this point I dismissed
my ignorant colleagues

622
00:32:08,816 --> 00:32:11,663
so that I could operate
the subtitle machine.

626
00:32:30,493 --> 00:32:31,859
Well, that's ridiculous.
What can I do with that?

00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,665
You're supposed to jump.

628
00:32:36,525 --> 00:32:38,126
Flipping horrific.

629
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:41,032
So you've butchered
a classic car?

630
00:32:41,423 --> 00:32:44,150
Right, watch this.
Little toss...

631
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,798
No.

632
00:32:46,823 --> 00:32:48,868
You need to think of...

633
00:33:04,577 --> 00:33:06,327

- Saved.

636
00:33:14,195 --> 00:33:17,397
that all top professional
footballers loved my car,

637
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,682
we got back on the road.

638
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,169
Did you get any orders?

639
00:33:23,413 --> 00:33:24,694
I noticed that the car park

640
00:33:24,725 --> 00:33:26,311
was still full of
Mercedes G-Class.

641
00:33:26,344 --> 00:33:28,632
- I saw that... Listen.
- Yeah.

642
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:31,639
I could put this...
into an auction,

643
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:33,608
one of those Posh,
up-market ones,

644
00:33:33,843 --> 00:33:35,882
and it would sell for £120,000.

645
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:38,030
- It would not!
- Aah! Aah!

- It cost me 14,000.
- 4,000.

700
00:36:07,656 --> 00:36:09,593
At £4,000...

701
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:11,537
At £4,000, any more?

702
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:12,904
(SILENCE)

703
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:17,867
At £4,000.

704
00:36:18,016 --> 00:36:19,445
Come and see us after.

705
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,347
You just lost ten grand.

706
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:23,969
He could have just
thrown it down the lavatory.

707
00:36:36,046 --> 00:36:37,748
It was rubbish.

708
00:36:38,312 --> 00:36:40,375
Hold on.

709
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:43,797
You were bidding on your own car.

710
00:36:44,008 --> 00:36:46,570
Well, a bit. I just wanted
to get the ball rolling.

711
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:48,008
But even then it didn't work

712
00:36:48,078 --> 00:36:49,975
because you only sold it
for four grand.

713
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,492
It cost you 14,000 to make

714
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:54,992
so you cost our production
company £10,000.

715
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:56,726
No, no, not true.

716
00:36:56,766 --> 00:36:59,156
- I put a reserve on it.
- What reserve?

717
00:36:59,234 --> 00:37:00,992
£100,000.

718
00:37:01,531 --> 00:37:03,922
- £100,000?
- So it didn't sell at all,

719
00:37:03,976 --> 00:37:06,346
which means you cost us £14,000?

720
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:10,570
Well, yes, but we've
ended up with The Excellent.

721
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:14,366
No, we're stuck
with The Excellent.

722
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,836
It's really difficult to
know, working with you,

723
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,211
things like this, is it ambition

724
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:21,773
or are you a lunatic?

725
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:24,656
Sadly there isn't time
to answer that question,

726
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:28,875
because it's time to play
Celebrity Brain Crash.

727
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:38,711
Our guest this week
is a local girl

728
00:37:39,078 --> 00:37:43,281
who is responsible for one of my
all-time favourite pop songs,

729
00:37:43,453 --> 00:37:45,508
99 Red Balloons.

730
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:47,516
She is a singer,

731
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:49,891
she's an armpit hair enthusiast

732
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,195
and she's
an all-round good sport.

733
00:37:52,273 --> 00:37:54,734
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Nena!

734
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:17,903
- Where is she?
- I've got no idea. Um...

735
00:38:19,185 --> 00:38:21,644
Oh. Oh, no...

736
00:38:22,011 --> 00:38:23,995
It's hard to see
through the smog,

737
00:38:24,081 --> 00:38:25,761
but yes, that is...

738
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,800
- Oh, no.
- No. What's happened here is...

739
00:38:28,902 --> 00:38:30,175
Nena...

740
00:38:30,292 --> 00:38:33,511
yes, she's been
carried away by 99...

741
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,248
- Red Ballons.
- Oh, no.

742
00:38:37,703 --> 00:38:39,170
Bad.

743
00:38:44,515 --> 00:38:46,468
Does that mean
she's not coming on, then?

744
00:38:46,804 --> 00:38:49,031
Well, James, she's floated
up into the stratosphere,

745
00:38:49,203 --> 00:38:52,429
her eyelids have frozen over
and her lungs are inside out.

746
00:38:52,562 --> 00:38:54,297
So that is a no.

747
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,889
It's OK, though.

748
00:38:55,914 --> 00:38:58,695
We anticipated
that Nena may float away.

749
00:38:58,765 --> 00:39:01,703
- We have a back-up plan. We'll activate it.
- You sit down.

750
00:39:01,992 --> 00:39:05,148
You see, the thing is...
that more and more stuff,

751
00:39:05,203 --> 00:39:08,593
these days, is being powered
by rechargeable batteries.

752
00:39:08,672 --> 00:39:10,570
You know, phones, laptops.
That sort of thing.

753
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:13,047
And this is giving the world
a bit of a problem.

754
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:17,172
Because in Britain, our power
companies only produce

755
00:39:17,265 --> 00:39:20,625
five per cent more power
than we need.

756
00:39:20,718 --> 00:39:22,781
We're only just coping.

757
00:39:22,898 --> 00:39:25,461
It's actually worse
in the United States

758
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,765
cos they produce 16% less
than they actually need,

759
00:39:28,851 --> 00:39:31,265
which means they have
to import electricity.

760
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,945
So what is gonna happen
as more and more people

761
00:39:34,086 --> 00:39:36,601
are buying
and using electric cars?

762
00:39:36,718 --> 00:39:38,757
We're gonna need more power.
We may not be able to cope.

763
00:39:38,781 --> 00:39:40,711
No. I see the solution, you may think.

764
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:42,508
It-Its is to build more power stations.

765
00:39:42,578 --> 00:39:44,179
But if you even suggest that,

766
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:45,593
weird-beard
environmentalists run around

767
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,152
waving their arms
in the air, going,

768
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,687
"What about the polar bear
and the bats and the newt?"

769
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,170
Anyway, the point is we are going
to need more and more power

770
00:39:52,194 --> 00:39:56,023
to charge the batteries in
our phones, laptops and cars.

771
00:39:56,179 --> 00:39:58,959
- Where are we gonna get it from?
- This got us thinking.

772
00:39:59,068 --> 00:40:02,748
How much electricity could we
possibly generate... every day

773
00:40:02,773 --> 00:40:04,258
just during our normal lives?

774
00:40:04,398 --> 00:40:08,133
And what if we could
harness it in some way?

775
00:40:10,515 --> 00:40:13,867
This is an office block
in the centre of London.

776
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,484
Like many office blocks,
it has a revolving door,

777
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:21,937
which spins constantly
as people come and go.

778
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:26,422
So, why not simply connect
that door to a generator

779
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:30,781
and turn all that spinning
into electricity?

780
00:40:31,258 --> 00:40:34,242
And it's not just
revolving doors, either.

781
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,859
Many of us have dogs

782
00:40:37,945 --> 00:40:41,125
and every day we take
those dogs for a walk.

783
00:40:42,922 --> 00:40:45,640
A dog scampers hither
and thither, running ahead

784
00:40:45,687 --> 00:40:47,264
and snouting under hedgerows.

785
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:51,398
So why not attach it
to a trailer like this?

786
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:53,039
Dog pulls the trailer along.

787
00:40:53,093 --> 00:40:55,621
Inside this wheel is a dynamo.

788
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:58,023
It makes electricity,
goes along these wires

789
00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:59,297
and into this capacitor,

790
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:01,312
and when that dial reads 100%,

791
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,261
I'm charging my phone,

792
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,023
So, dog's harnessed.

793
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:06,932
That was easy.
Attached to the trailer.

794
00:41:07,008 --> 00:41:09,367
All I've got to do
is set her going.

795
00:41:09,726 --> 00:41:12,367
And I've even planned
for that. So, here we go.

796
00:41:12,582 --> 00:41:13,984
Fetch!

797
00:41:16,734 --> 00:41:18,143
Ah-haa!

798
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,878
Yeah! Your favourite!

799
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:24,327
Chase!

800
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,109
Maybe this dog's broken?

801
00:41:28,437 --> 00:41:31,322
Meanwhile, back in London,

802
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:33,091
James was charging his phone

803
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:36,742
from a contraption he'd
fitted to the revolving door.

804
00:41:47,428 --> 00:41:50,875
And even Jeremy had decided
to get in on the action.

805
00:41:52,523 --> 00:41:54,672
This school sports day,

806
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:57,336
in my mind, is a power station.

807
00:41:57,445 --> 00:42:00,500
All we have to do is fit
the children with harnesses

808
00:42:00,695 --> 00:42:04,422
and I could have this
charged up in no time at all.

809
00:42:05,304 --> 00:42:07,648
Here we go!

810
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,383
Straightaway we can see

811
00:42:09,408 --> 00:42:12,297
that... charge is being produced.

812
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,422
Not much, but some.

813
00:42:14,718 --> 00:42:16,835
Come on, all of you!
Come on!

814
00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:21,242
Put your back into it!
Catch him! Chop-chop!

815
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:24,743
This is the work of a genius.

816
00:42:24,984 --> 00:42:26,277
Back in the countryside,

817
00:42:26,406 --> 00:42:27,846
I'd mended my dog

818
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:30,523
and things were going
well here too.

819
00:42:30,992 --> 00:42:33,437
As you can see,
the dog is now running,

820
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:34,686
the wheels are turning,

821
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:36,750
electricity is being generated.

822
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:39,304
He's basically
a four-legged Sellafield!

823
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:40,358
♪♪

824
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:43,922
Sadly, however, in London,
it was the middle of the day

825
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:47,312
and no one had been using
James's door.

826
00:42:48,968 --> 00:42:51,440
As a result,
his phone was dying.

827
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,805
So he had to get radical.

828
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,787
15%.

829
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,932
Nice.

830
00:43:13,312 --> 00:43:15,429
Apart from
a couple of hiccups...

831
00:43:15,491 --> 00:43:17,060
Go!

832
00:43:21,289 --> 00:43:23,984
You'll have to put a little
bit more effort in than that.

833
00:43:24,265 --> 00:43:25,904
Everything was going well.

834
00:43:26,015 --> 00:43:28,008
The power was flooding in.

835
00:43:28,116 --> 00:43:29,484
Oh, yes!

836
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:32,133
25%.

837
00:43:32,226 --> 00:43:33,511
And we were forced to conclude

838
00:43:33,578 --> 00:43:36,988
that it had been a successful
day for all of us.

839
00:43:37,261 --> 00:43:40,277
Well, when I say all of us...

840
00:43:40,686 --> 00:43:42,097
No. Look, listen.

841
00:43:42,214 --> 00:43:45,891
I can see why you're
here. Um...

842
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,794
Obviously, fitting
children with harnesses

843
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,042
and then... videoing them,

844
00:43:51,108 --> 00:43:52,609
and they're not my children...

845
00:44:02,302 --> 00:44:06,226
I got... I got 45% charge
in my phone.

846
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,849
I got 41% charge.

847
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:11,412
I got a different
sort of charge.

848
00:44:12,052 --> 00:44:13,638
Anyway, since we had proved...

849
00:44:13,669 --> 00:44:14,934
well, Hammond and I
had proved...

850
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:17,435
that it was possible
to charge up a telephone...

851
00:44:17,505 --> 00:44:21,026
I began to wonder
if we could charge up a car

852
00:44:21,279 --> 00:44:24,129
using nothing more than vanity.

853
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:30,396
In London alone,
there are over 750 gyms,

854
00:44:30,474 --> 00:44:32,833
and every day they are
full of people

855
00:44:33,013 --> 00:44:35,380
picking things up
and putting them down again

856
00:44:35,513 --> 00:44:37,809
so they can be more attractive.

857
00:44:39,591 --> 00:44:42,169
So why not use
all this colossal effort?

858
00:44:42,834 --> 00:44:44,235
Let's harness it!

859
00:44:46,005 --> 00:44:48,591
And that's exactly
what we have done.

860
00:44:48,794 --> 00:44:50,216
Ten of the machines in this gym

861
00:44:50,302 --> 00:44:51,818
have been connected to a device

862
00:44:51,904 --> 00:44:54,732
which produces a smooth
flow of electricity

863
00:44:54,841 --> 00:44:59,123
that's sent outside to this
G-Wiz in the car park.

864
00:45:00,755 --> 00:45:03,083
Right now the battery is flat.

865
00:45:03,154 --> 00:45:04,779
So I'm going to plug it in

866
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,607
and then after eight hours,
we'll see how far I can drive

867
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:11,623
on electricity that's been
generated... in there.

868
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:26,995
Come on, you're slacking.

869
00:45:42,235 --> 00:45:45,238
Right. Unplug from the gym.

870
00:45:46,812 --> 00:45:48,814
Let's see how far we go.

871
00:45:55,581 --> 00:45:59,003
Look at this. This is epic
because I'm driving along

872
00:45:59,081 --> 00:46:01,636
in a car, sort of.

873
00:46:01,908 --> 00:46:03,580
No fossil fuel has been burned,

874
00:46:03,675 --> 00:46:05,721
and no atoms have been split.

875
00:46:05,909 --> 00:46:07,675
Nothing's been fracked up.

876
00:46:15,004 --> 00:46:17,843
Look, there's a man
pushing that pushchair.

877
00:46:18,238 --> 00:46:20,045
Stick a little dynamo on that,

878
00:46:20,425 --> 00:46:24,043
kid gets some fresh air,
I get more battery charge.

879
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,230
It's difficult to see who
loses from this arrangement.

880
00:46:31,316 --> 00:46:33,816
I get a trip home,
effectively for nothing,

881
00:46:34,027 --> 00:46:36,824
the people going to the gym
feel good, look good,

882
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:39,918
they become healthier,
the NHS saves money,

883
00:46:39,957 --> 00:46:40,941
cos people are less likely

884
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:42,847
to have strokes
and what have you.

885
00:46:42,941 --> 00:46:45,886
If one person in a hundred
gets a free gy...

886
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:51,542
Hang on.

887
00:46:55,889 --> 00:46:58,045
I was enjoying driving on pedal

888
00:46:58,084 --> 00:47:00,615
and... cross-trainer power!

889
00:47:03,537 --> 00:47:06,858
And with that, I think
it's back to the tent.

890
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:14,900
James... James May,

891
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,978
how far... did you get

892
00:47:18,087 --> 00:47:20,564
after eight hours of charging?

893
00:47:20,751 --> 00:47:22,774
Actually, it was
better than I expected.

894
00:47:22,876 --> 00:47:25,064
I did 21 miles.

895
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:27,947
Hang on, though. To get
from our office in London

896
00:47:28,087 --> 00:47:29,814
to my home in nearly Wales,

897
00:47:29,906 --> 00:47:33,126
that's 130 miles, 21 miles at...

898
00:47:33,212 --> 00:47:35,329
So six stops at gyms,
eight hours a time,

899
00:47:35,354 --> 00:47:36,306
and the actual driving,

900
00:47:36,337 --> 00:47:38,548
it would take me three days

901
00:47:38,642 --> 00:47:39,736
to get home!

902
00:47:39,845 --> 00:47:42,127
Or, Hammond, just an idea,

903
00:47:42,407 --> 00:47:44,996
you could maybe get
a petrol-powered car,

904
00:47:45,259 --> 00:47:46,931
put some petrol in it,

905
00:47:47,017 --> 00:47:48,466
and be home in two hours.

906
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,468
That's a better...
I'm gonna do that.

907
00:47:50,543 --> 00:47:51,697
Yes. So there we are.

908
00:47:51,782 --> 00:47:53,954
That's the future,
and it's made of petrol.

909
00:47:54,021 --> 00:47:56,595
So we've addressed that nicely.

910
00:47:59,192 --> 00:48:01,227
Moving on...

911
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,450
Now...

912
00:48:06,028 --> 00:48:07,879
There are people
all over the world

913
00:48:07,965 --> 00:48:11,770
who believe we are permanently
on the verge of nuclear war,

914
00:48:11,895 --> 00:48:14,667
alien invasion or Zombie attack.

915
00:48:14,817 --> 00:48:16,137
It isn't a niche thing.

916
00:48:16,286 --> 00:48:18,817
There's 120,000 of these
people at least.

917
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:20,864
They call themselves preppers.

918
00:48:21,036 --> 00:48:22,622
- Morons.
- Shut up.

919
00:48:23,003 --> 00:48:24,550
- Idiots.
- And these preppers,

920
00:48:24,605 --> 00:48:27,136
in order to prepare for
an extinction-level event,

921
00:48:27,211 --> 00:48:29,426
stock their homes
with essential supplies,

922
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:31,364
they go out into the woods
and practise tactics,

923
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:34,809
and they create what
they call bug-out cars.

924
00:48:34,868 --> 00:48:36,305
They're brilliant.
Here is one. Look.

925
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:38,598
- Look at that!
- Yeah! I know!

926
00:48:38,723 --> 00:48:40,958
- No, Hammond, that is not brilliant.
- It is.

927
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,997
No. Are you saying we can prepare
for a nuclear attack

928
00:48:45,114 --> 00:48:48,395
by putting some spikes
on the wheels of a Hyundai?

929
00:48:48,497 --> 00:48:51,044
What if the nuclear attack

930
00:48:51,168 --> 00:48:52,785
comes from the back
of the Hyundai?

931
00:48:52,902 --> 00:48:55,083
All-All you're gonna do
with that car

932
00:48:55,153 --> 00:48:57,887
- is snag your jumper on it.
- Oh, don't be so negative.

933
00:48:57,972 --> 00:49:01,285
In this show you have wasted
14,000 of our pounds

934
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:02,887
on your stupid Mercedes car.

935
00:49:03,002 --> 00:49:04,572
You have wasted all of our time

936
00:49:04,597 --> 00:49:06,379
with your sweat-powered
electric car.

937
00:49:06,512 --> 00:49:09,490
This is my thing.
Let me do it.

938
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,654
You do realise
there's no such thing

939
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:12,777
as a Zombie, don't you?

940
00:49:12,802 --> 00:49:15,200
Don't spoil it for him.

941
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,849
I like the idea
of being a prepper,

942
00:49:17,927 --> 00:49:21,536
so I thought I'd have a go
at making my own bug-out car.

943
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:31,102
This is what I came up with.

944
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:38,732
It started life as a VW
campervan, high-top version.

945
00:49:38,919 --> 00:49:42,185
But I've stripped it
of its hippie heritage

946
00:49:42,403 --> 00:49:44,707
to turn it into a vehicle
that can bare its teeth

947
00:49:44,771 --> 00:49:47,794
in a dangerous,
post-apocalyptic world.

948
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,536
And I love it!

949
00:49:55,271 --> 00:49:57,857
I'm so unbelievably
pleased with this thing.

950
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:03,372
I feel invincible,
ready, prepared.

951
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:05,841
Which is hardly surprising,

952
00:50:05,935 --> 00:50:08,552
given the modifications
I've made.

953
00:50:09,443 --> 00:50:11,161
At the front, a battering ram.

954
00:50:11,325 --> 00:50:13,786
You can be pretty sure
the roads won't be clear.

955
00:50:13,919 --> 00:50:15,946
The ram itself
is fitted with spikes

956
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,083
for fending off zombies
at close quarters.

957
00:50:18,193 --> 00:50:19,341
Then, up top,

958
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,396
a bank of powerful rally lights

959
00:50:21,466 --> 00:50:24,958
to cut through the murky soup
of a nuclear winter.

960
00:50:25,294 --> 00:50:27,758
Of course, not everyone
I meet will be friendly.

961
00:50:27,825 --> 00:50:30,027
So, up here...

962
00:50:36,177 --> 00:50:37,315
weapons rack.

963
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,574
Everything I need

964
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:41,839
to defend myself against
cannibals and zombies.

965
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:44,775
Round here, water. Essential.

966
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,771
Subtle stuff too.
I don't want to stand out,

967
00:50:47,927 --> 00:50:49,482
hence the camouflage paint.

968
00:50:49,615 --> 00:50:50,757
But perhaps most importantly,

969
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:52,750
the whole of my
bug-out campervan

970
00:50:52,872 --> 00:50:54,411
has been armour-plated.

971
00:50:55,349 --> 00:50:57,555
I really have thought of
everything!

972
00:50:57,693 --> 00:50:59,023
No, you haven't!

973
00:50:59,081 --> 00:51:01,490
All you've done is ruined
a perfectly good campervan.

974
00:51:01,575 --> 00:51:03,740
- No.
- I haven't! It's brilliant.

975
00:51:03,802 --> 00:51:05,419
It's bullet-proof all over!

976
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:07,380
- Bullet-proof? Is it?
- Yes.

977
00:51:07,443 --> 00:51:09,138
- Is it? Is it?
- Yes, it is.

978
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,599
- Oh, yeah, sounds like it.
- Tanks feel like that.

979
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:14,724
OK, then, these are guns.
Use them.

980
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:17,747
- What, on you?
- No, on the van. Shoot it.

981
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:19,818
- Are we ready, gentlemen?
- Yes.

982
00:51:20,857 --> 00:51:22,794
Ha! Didn't go through!

983
00:51:23,521 --> 00:51:24,958
Just chipped the paint.
That's all you've done.

984
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:26,802
- Yes. Hammond?
- Yeah?

985
00:51:26,857 --> 00:51:29,005
What you're suggesting
is these aliens,

986
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,021
they're going to travel
trillions of miles

987
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,372
using a propulsion system
that we can't even conceive

988
00:51:34,513 --> 00:51:37,162
and then they're going to
try and take over the world

989
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,427
using .177 Air rifles?

990
00:51:39,802 --> 00:51:42,019
Well, if they do,
I shall be ready for them.

991
00:51:44,279 --> 00:51:47,325
Especially given
what I've done in here.

992
00:51:48,036 --> 00:51:50,997
Inside, I've turned this
once-humble campervan

993
00:51:51,122 --> 00:51:54,833
into literally the highest-tech
command centre imaginable.

994
00:51:54,935 --> 00:51:57,200
Up front,
carbon dioxide scrubbers,

995
00:51:57,271 --> 00:51:58,865
just like the ones on Apollo 13.

996
00:51:58,997 --> 00:52:02,599
They will purify the air,
even in case of radiation.

997
00:52:02,724 --> 00:52:07,036
And you can measure that radiation
on these systems up here.

998
00:52:07,247 --> 00:52:09,404
Water. You may not
be able to find it.

999
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:11,575
Need to make it.
It's essential.

1000
00:52:11,654 --> 00:52:14,888
I've fitted a system
that recycles urine.

1001
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:18,060
Basically you do
your number ones up there.

1002
00:52:19,107 --> 00:52:20,372
Operate the pumps.

1003
00:52:20,435 --> 00:52:22,130
They send the results up,

1004
00:52:22,286 --> 00:52:25,169
across, and into the water
purification system.

1005
00:52:25,255 --> 00:52:30,060
It emerges from that as
purest... drinking water.

1006
00:52:34,052 --> 00:52:36,607
Food. I'm gonna need it.
I've got a chicken.

1007
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:39,083
It lays eggs.
They go in there.

1008
00:52:39,176 --> 00:52:42,074
And perhaps best of all,
the pâté de foie gras

1009
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,849
of the bug-out community...

1010
00:52:43,974 --> 00:52:45,696
chicken soup.

1011
00:52:45,919 --> 00:52:48,732
I love all this. Setting
out into the wilderness

1012
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:50,982
in my little house on wheels,

1013
00:52:51,154 --> 00:52:54,857
knowing I've got everything
I need, whatever happens.

1014
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,341
What the...?

1015
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,833
Am I penetrating
his bulletproof armour?

1016
00:53:02,911 --> 00:53:05,883
Ummm Yes. And his food.

1017
00:53:06,715 --> 00:53:09,365
Oh! That's my own urine!

1018
00:53:11,482 --> 00:53:14,302
- Are you two doing this?
- Yes, he is!

1019
00:53:14,372 --> 00:53:17,247
I'd get out of the way
if I were you.

1020
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,818
The trouble with the chicken
is, it moves around,

1021
00:53:19,904 --> 00:53:21,341
making this a...

1022
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:25,138
- Oh, good idea!
- Isn't it!

1023
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:31,161
Right, reloading, James.
Reloading.

1024
00:53:31,325 --> 00:53:32,731
Oh, yes!

1025
00:53:44,184 --> 00:53:46,815
- Good shot.
- Not bad, was it?

1026
00:53:47,884 --> 00:53:50,252
Sort of game over now, really.

1027
00:53:50,481 --> 00:53:51,482
Hm.

1028
00:53:52,923 --> 00:53:54,224
Right...

1029
00:53:56,932 --> 00:53:58,705
It wasn't game over, though,

1030
00:53:58,955 --> 00:54:00,971
because I went back
to the drawing board

1031
00:54:01,057 --> 00:54:02,940
and started again.

1032
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:07,453
Three months' work.

1033
00:54:07,659 --> 00:54:09,971
I've used the same basic
interior set-up,

1034
00:54:10,065 --> 00:54:12,674
but I've completely re-thought
the armour plating,

1035
00:54:12,768 --> 00:54:15,182
so that whatever
those two have...

1036
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:26,170
Now, this is a Scimitar
light reconnaissance tank.

1037
00:54:26,248 --> 00:54:30,670
It's small, it's quite fast,
and it's quite manoeuvrable.

1038
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:33,787
Its job is to skip around
the battlefield like a goat

1039
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,592
and find stuff.

1040
00:54:39,803 --> 00:54:42,459
Now, look at Hammond, running
around in a mad panic.

1041
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,131
He thinks I'm gonna
shoot him, but I'm not.

1042
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,685
I'm just here
to mark him with a laser.

1043
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:50,881
He's gonna shoot him.

1044
00:54:57,678 --> 00:55:01,014
Yes, this is a Challenger 2
main battle tank.

1045
00:55:03,037 --> 00:55:05,545
And this really is
a bug-out vehicle.

1046
00:55:05,624 --> 00:55:06,851
It's certainly a lot better
than, I don't know,

1047
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:10,115
a Hyundai with spikes
on the wheels.

1048
00:55:10,787 --> 00:55:14,379
It'll totally protect its
occupants from... radiation,

1049
00:55:14,412 --> 00:55:16,714
nuclear fallout, gas,

1050
00:55:17,037 --> 00:55:20,384
even a direct hit, thanks
to its incredible armour,

1051
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:23,490
from any known
battlefield weapon.

1052
00:55:24,962 --> 00:55:26,817
Then there's this gun,
which is...

1053
00:55:26,919 --> 00:55:29,694
there's no other word...
enormous!

1054
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,263
120mm.

1055
00:55:31,669 --> 00:55:33,152
And it could hit a target...

1056
00:55:33,177 --> 00:55:36,349
let's say
Richard Hammond's van...

1057
00:55:36,536 --> 00:55:40,755
while the tank itself is doing
30mph over rough ground.

1058
00:55:42,263 --> 00:55:45,661
I think, though, today
I shall fire while stationary

1059
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:47,945
because I want to
savour the moment.

1060
00:55:48,068 --> 00:55:51,029
OK, thank you, chaps.
If we could stop there...

1061
00:55:51,122 --> 00:55:52,182
Right, going down.

1062
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:53,958
Roger. Going down.

1063
00:55:57,254 --> 00:55:58,656
Oh, dear!

1064
00:56:01,122 --> 00:56:04,536
I've loaded the gun with
a high-explosive shell.

1065
00:56:04,896 --> 00:56:06,443
It's a tracer shell,
so we'll be able

1066
00:56:06,552 --> 00:56:07,716
to monitor its progress

1067
00:56:07,755 --> 00:56:10,568
as it arcs toward the target.

1068
00:56:10,747 --> 00:56:13,052
Oh, Commander Clarkson,
this is fantastic!

1069
00:56:13,138 --> 00:56:15,529
I can see him right there.
Have you got him?

1070
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:16,904
Yeah.

1071
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:19,755
You bastards!

1072
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,177
Oh, just put him out
of his misery, will you?

1073
00:56:22,355 --> 00:56:24,888
- Fire!
- Thud.

1074
00:56:38,154 --> 00:56:43,083
I'm not sure his bug-out
vehicle was quite as strong

1075
00:56:43,138 --> 00:56:45,388
as he may have
led you to believe.

1076
00:56:49,638 --> 00:56:51,072
Right...

1077
00:57:01,169 --> 00:57:02,442
Many months later,

1078
00:57:02,536 --> 00:57:05,294
I was ready to unveil
my third attempt...

1079
00:57:07,304 --> 00:57:09,342
an impregnable fortress.

1080
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:13,081
Oh, yeah!

1081
00:57:15,228 --> 00:57:17,130
This is bug-out heaven!

1082
00:57:18,244 --> 00:57:20,583
I've used as my inspiration

1083
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,635
the armoured personnel
carrier from Aliens,

1084
00:57:23,916 --> 00:57:27,330
on the basis that if it can
protect Sigourney Weaver

1085
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:30,315
from that metal bitey
thing with teeth,

1086
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:34,268
it can keep me safe from
Jeremy Clarkson and James May.

1087
00:57:34,471 --> 00:57:38,596
Underneath this beast are the basic
elements of an Alvis Stalwart.

1088
00:57:38,752 --> 00:57:41,658
So it was already
armour-plated, amphibious,

1089
00:57:41,783 --> 00:57:43,088
massively powerful,

1090
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:46,048
six-wheel drive
and four-wheel steering.

1091
00:57:51,487 --> 00:57:54,605
And what I've gone and done
is improve it.

1092
00:58:02,893 --> 00:58:06,479
It's got a honeycombed
lattice work

1093
00:58:06,565 --> 00:58:08,643
of ceramic-steel
armour plating.

1094
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:11,104
It's three times thicker
than the armour you'll find

1095
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:14,932
on the turret of
an Abrams A1M1 tank.

1096
00:58:18,237 --> 00:58:23,118
In testing, I fired a 7.62
round at that hull,

1097
00:58:23,143 --> 00:58:26,908
and all it left
was a mark... like that one.

1098
00:58:27,785 --> 00:58:29,518
This thing is incredible.

1099
00:58:34,284 --> 00:58:37,292
Whatever those two
are planning this time,

1100
00:58:37,471 --> 00:58:38,870
it won't work.

1101
00:58:39,026 --> 00:58:42,643
They won't be able
to damage my soup now.

1102
00:58:47,561 --> 00:58:49,108
Drone feed stabilised.

1103
00:58:49,264 --> 00:58:51,084
Vehicle spotted in the open.

1104
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,764
45 stand by to engage target.

1105
00:58:53,926 --> 00:58:55,928
45 stood to engage target.

1106
00:59:05,006 --> 00:59:08,186
This shell...
is twice as powerful

1107
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:12,295
as the shell we fired...
from the tank.

1108
00:59:12,449 --> 00:59:16,397
And it can hit a target...
13 miles away.

1109
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,237
Loading weapon.

1110
00:59:29,905 --> 00:59:31,780
Hot room, gun loaded.
Gun ready.

1111
00:59:31,805 --> 00:59:32,817
Fire mission,

1112
00:59:32,842 --> 00:59:37,881
target number
Uniform Tango 1805.

1113
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,936
Altitude 35.

1114
00:59:40,028 --> 00:59:43,123
Direction 4600.

1115
00:59:43,241 --> 00:59:48,116
Gun target line 130.
Ready 68.

1116
00:59:48,241 --> 00:59:49,686
Command approve.

1117
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:51,647
45. Engage.

1118
00:59:51,826 --> 00:59:55,194
Command approve. 45. Fire.

1119
01:00:01,053 --> 01:00:04,741
They're bored. They've
realised I'm unhurtable...

1120
01:00:06,191 --> 01:00:07,593
and given up.

1121
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,326
Five seconds to impact.

1122
01:00:10,514 --> 01:00:11,890
They probably think
it's really funny.

1123
01:00:11,914 --> 01:00:14,116
They probably think
I'm out here all...

1124
01:00:24,016 --> 01:00:26,234
45. Target destroyed.

1125
01:00:36,595 --> 01:00:38,095
Yeah.

1126
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:41,903
Now,

1127
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:44,775
we went through
the wreckage afterwards

1128
01:00:44,842 --> 01:00:48,739
and this is all that remains
of Richard Hammond.

1129
01:00:48,793 --> 01:00:50,628
He's just dust,
and we know it is Hammond

1130
01:00:50,653 --> 01:00:53,784
because we found this
suspiciously white tooth...

1131
01:00:55,155 --> 01:00:56,624
in it. That's...

1132
01:00:57,851 --> 01:01:00,591
- That's him.
- That's him.

1133
01:01:02,231 --> 01:01:04,864
So, there you are, preppers.

1134
01:01:04,966 --> 01:01:07,903
The tragic remains of Richard
Hammond are proof positive

1135
01:01:08,028 --> 01:01:10,692
that your hobby is
utterly pointless.

1136
01:01:10,868 --> 01:01:13,809
- You spilled him!
- Spilt him on the floor.

1137
01:01:14,192 --> 01:01:15,762
Now you've got him
all over your shoes.

1138
01:01:15,863 --> 01:01:17,729
I know. Even when he's dust,
he's annoying.

1139
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:19,343
Anyway...

1140
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,044
On that terrible disappointment,

1141
01:01:21,091 --> 01:01:22,727
it is time to end.

1142
01:01:23,208 --> 01:01:24,567
He's pretty much gone now.

1143
01:01:24,592 --> 01:01:25,707
Thank you very much
for watching.

1144
01:01:25,731 --> 01:01:27,333
See you next time. Goodbye!
