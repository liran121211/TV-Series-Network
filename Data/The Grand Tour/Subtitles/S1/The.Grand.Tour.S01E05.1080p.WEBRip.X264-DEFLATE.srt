1
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,610
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,380
Hello. Thank you.

3
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,150
Hello.

4
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,220
Thank you.

5
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,590
Thank you so much.

6
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,230
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to the Grand Tour,

7
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,160
which, this week,
comes from the Netherlands.

8
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,900
We're setting something
of a record, actually,

9
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:31,180
cos we are the first three
British men ever to come here
for a weekend

10
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,180
and not vomit
on a prostitute.

11
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,250
Actually,
we love coming to Holland.

12
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,980
James for his...
for his own reasons.

13
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,020
And I like it because
the Dutch are officially

14
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,190
the tallest people on earth.

15
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,920
It's true. True fact.

16
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,530
- Yes, and I hate it here.
- I'm sick of...

17
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,530
I'm sick of staring
at belly buttons all day.

18
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,970
The only problem I do have here
is that I'm not allowed to use
the word "swaffelen".

19
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,370
- Yeah.

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,940
Well, you just did,
didn't you?

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,210
No, the thing is, OK,
it is a really bad word here,

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,880
and I have no idea why.

23
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,650
- What does it mean?
- It means...

24
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,720
It means to bang
your gentleman sausage...

25
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,950
...on the side
of the Taj Mahal.

26
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,960
Oh, God!

27
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,760
Anyway, listen. Erm...

28
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,490
We're in Rotterdam,
which is a marvellous city,
in fact,

29
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,630
because you aren't allowed to
bring a car into the city -

30
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,270
a petrol car -
if it was built before 1992.

31
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,640
You aren't allowed to bring
a diesel car into the city
if it was built before 2000,

32
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,080
which means you're never
held up by poor people.

33
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,950
-Really?
-What else can we say
about the Dutch?

34
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,750
-Oh, of course, you gave
the world speed cameras.
-Oh, yeah.

35
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,750
-So thank you very much
for that.
-Thank you.

36
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,990
No, actually,
I'd far rather be pulled over

37
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,560
by the actual Dutch police
rather than a speed camera,

38
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,260
cos, boy, oh, boy,
do these guys look good.

39
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,330
-We've got a picture here.
-Whoa!

40
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,870
I would very much like to see
a lady policeman in an outfit
like that.

41
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,040
- It looks like the guy
on the right already has.

42
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,940
- Shall we get on
with the show... man?

43
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,610
Yes, good idea. Er...

44
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,880
And coming up in our
programme about cars
this week...

45
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,050
I try to pull a camel.

46
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,420
Come on. Come on.

47
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,660
A donkey pulls James.

48
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,460
And Richard gets stuck
in a cow orgy.

49
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,760
I-I really am alarmed.

50
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:38,370
But first, there's been a bit
of an argument in the office
between these two.

51
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,200
You see, Richard maintains

52
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,870
that the Mazda MX-5
is all the sports car
you would ever need.

53
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,210
-Because it is.
-Mm-hm.
But James says it isn't.

54
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,810
Because it isn't.

55
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,820
So we decided
they should sort it out

56
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,420
by going to
the obvious proving ground
for all sports cars:

57
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,420
North Africa.

58
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,690
This is it,

59
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,370
the latest version of
the bestselling two-seater
roadster of all time.

60
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,470
And it's easy to see why.

61
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,070
Peppy little engine
at the front,

62
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,440
two seats in the open air in
the middle, rearwheel drive.

63
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,110
It's the perfect
sports-car recipe.

64
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,980
But layered on top of that
in this new version

65
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,450
you get air conditioning,
heated seats,

66
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,850
lane-departure assist,
cruise control,

67
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,650
rain-sensing wipers,
dusk-sensing headlamps.

68
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,860
You just can't do any better.

69
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,760
Well, you can, actually,
because all of those luxury
items you're mentioning now,

70
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,500
they just add weight,
and they mean it isn't
a true sports car any more.

71
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,000
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

72
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,770
Colin Chapman, he was
the bloke who founded Lotus,

73
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,810
he said the ethos of
a sports car is simplify
and add lightness.

74
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,640
He didn't say you simplify
and add electric windows.

75
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,210
Yep, and then he gave all his
money away to a drug dealer
called John DeLorean.

76
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,150
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is what it's actually about.

77
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,220
This is called the Zenos.

78
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,920
You get four wheels,
you get somewhere to sit,
an engine, and that's it.

79
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,520
It's a sports car.

80
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,660
-Yeah.
What do you do if it rains?
-Well, you'd get wet.

81
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,660
What if you want to listen
to the radio?

82
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,600
Why would I want to listen
to the radio around here?

83
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,300
-Does it have a heater?
-No.

84
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,200
-Has it got windows?
-Look, if you buy
a football boot,

85
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,300
you don't expect it to be
usable as a ballet shoe,
do you?

86
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,210
But Mazda has invented
a football boot that you can
wear to the opera.

87
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,050
Look, I can guarantee
that if you wear that shoe
to the opera house...

88
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,880
At this point,
the director said

89
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,920
he'd heard enough about shoes
for one day...

90
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,660
...and told us
to go for a drive.

91
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,200
Right, now I'm away from
Hammond's luxury sports car
resort,

92
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,470
let me tell you a little bit
about this remarkable car.

93
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,140
It's powered by
the 2L turbocharged engine

94
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,740
from the Ford Focus ST,
giving 250 horsepower.

95
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,480
That's mounted in the middle,
right behind my head there,

96
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,850
driving the rear wheels
through a no-nonsense,

97
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,190
old-school six-speed gearbox.

98
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,790
Now, 250 horsepower
doesn't sound like a huge
amount in the modern world,

99
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,860
but this car,
made with an aluminium spine

100
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,730
and composite tub,
and all the rest of it,

101
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,760
weighs less than
three quarters of a tonne,

102
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,070
so it is genuinely quick.

103
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,800
Look... Whoa!

104
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,810
Yeah!

105
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:15,750
It makes the noise of some
futuristic propulsion system
powered by antimatter.

106
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,160
Yes! Electrifying!

107
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,170
James comes from a world
where he wants his phone
and his camera separate.

108
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,740
"I like a paper diary."

109
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,880
This Mazda is a smartphone.
It does everything.

110
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,080
It looks brilliant,
it will be endlessly reliable,
it's fast,

111
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,050
it's got speakers
in the headrests,
and it handles well.

112
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,590
And you can get an MX-5
from £18,500.

113
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,560
James's car
starts at £33,000,

114
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,800
and you don't even get doors!

115
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,230
My shed has got doors.

116
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,070
I furnish my cats with doors.

117
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,670
You need doors.

118
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,420
I bet he's being shaken
to death in that thing.

119
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,220
I bet Hammond thinks
I'm being shaken to death
in here,

120
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,620
but actually he's wrong,

121
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,060
because this isn't like
a BAC Mono or a Radical.

122
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,460
It is obviously very much a
car for taking on the track,

123
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,400
but it's been tuned
for road use.

124
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,660
It's quite supple.

125
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,830
See? Look.

126
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,430
Bump. It's all right.

127
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,900
I'm very relaxed.

128
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,040
Eventually,
we pulled over
for a cup of coffee

129
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,280
and a bit more arguing
about doors.

130
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,080
Just because they had them
in the 12th century

131
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,420
on cathedrals, whatever,
you don't need them now.

132
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,890
Don't be a slave
to convention.

133
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,020
But people had eyelids
in the 12th century,

134
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,730
and nobody's deciding,
"Let's get rid of those,
they're old hat."

135
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,230
"Oh, no! I've got dust in
my eyes and I can't sleep."

136
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,430
That's completely facile,
Hammond. You know exactly
what I mean.

137
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,100
The door... I mean,
Riva speedboats
don't have doors.

138
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,630
You don't say...

139
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,500
This is lovely, isn't it?

140
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,100
What are you doing here?

141
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,740
Well, word reached me that
you two were talking rubbish.

142
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,240
-What do you mean, "rubbish"?
-Well, if you want
the best sports car,

143
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,850
you don't want a Mazda
or a Zenos. You want--

144
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,750
Oh, God.
He's brought an Alfa Romeo.

145
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,320
Yes, of course I have.

146
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,320
Alfa Romeo 4C Spider.

147
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,660
This is what
I'm talking about.

148
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,500
A symphony in carbon fibre.

149
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,530
Balance personified.

150
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,970
The Graduate updated.

151
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,940
A mini Ferrari,
as cute as a bunny rabbit,

152
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,410
with the greatest badge
in the history of mo--

153
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,140
How much is it?

154
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,680
-You know perfectly well
how much it is.
-Yeah, we've forgotten.

155
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,850
Money is vulgar.

156
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,090
You can't put a price
on something
as exquisite as that.

157
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,360
Yeah, but Alfa Romeo
did put a price on it,
didn't they?

158
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,490
And what was it?

159
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,690
Sixty thousand pounds.

160
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,160
So you could have both
of our cars and everything
in the back of shot

161
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,300
for the price of
one of these Alfa Romeos?

162
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,740
I know, it is extraordinary
value for money.

163
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,310
-It's too far
from outside to inside.
-It's miles!

164
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,770
Yes, thick sills...

165
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,710
-Here we go.
-...for strength.

166
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,980
Look at this,
rotary heater knobs.

167
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,510
-It's like being in
the 1970s.
-Yeah, it is, actually.

168
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,820
This handbrake, look at that.

169
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,050
Is that fixed on
or does that come off?

170
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,550
Alfa Romeo, purveyors
of disappointment
for nearly three decades.

171
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,620
- Look at this. Classy.

172
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,260
Yeah.
Feel the quality in that.
Let me feel that.

173
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,130
Mm.
Sixty thousand
pounds?!

174
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,430
- Mm. And this...

175
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,100
That's what you want to hear.

176
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,000
If you ever buy
a new item of clothing,
never show it these two.

177
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:55,170
"What are you wearing that
jacket for? It makes you look
like a German gameshow host."

178
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,910
- That's satisfying.

179
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,780
Why are you wearing
that jacket?

180
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,010
Because I was at a party
in India last night,

181
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,480
and I've hurried over here.

182
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,010
Why did you go
to the party

183
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,350
dressed as a German
gameshow host?

184
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,750
Soon,
I grew weary of their abuse

185
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,360
and set off in what,
be in no doubt,

186
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,560
is my favourite car
on sale today.

187
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:22,630
I will admit, there are
one or two tiny little
problems with the 4C.

188
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,230
Trivial stuff.

189
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,170
It's very wide. The gearbox
is a little bit dim-witted.

190
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,610
If you fit sports exhausts,
the noise is catastrophic.

191
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,040
The petrol tank...
yeah, that's too small.

192
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,780
You've really only got
a range of 300... yards.

193
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,990
And then there's
the steering.

194
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,690
There's no power assistance,
so it's incredibly heavy
when you're parking,

195
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,790
there's no feel
when you're on the move.

196
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,560
And then,
and this is its party piece,

197
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:56,170
just occasionally,
it'll go violently left
or right for no reason.

198
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,300
Whoa! You see that?

199
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,440
Bloody hell.

200
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,810
But look at it this way,
we could all probably find
fault with our children,

201
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,480
and yet...
we still love them.

202
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,890
Jeremy loves Alfa Romeos

203
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,360
because,
back in the old days,

204
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,130
they were great...
but they're not any more.

205
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,030
Plenty of things were great.

206
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,560
Greece.

207
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,030
Rolf Harris.

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,500
You can't love them now.

209
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,070
Another small problem
with the Alfa

210
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,440
that I didn't mention earlier

211
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,640
is that you get cramp
after five minutes.

212
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,850
Ooh! Arg!

213
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,850
I'm gonna have to stop
and go for a walk,

214
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,450
and they'll want to know why,

215
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,520
and I'll have to tell them
I need a wee or something.

216
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,990
No, diarrhoea.

217
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,430
Sorry, I've got to stop.
I've got to stop.

218
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,730
I'm just stopping
for a minute here. Hang on.

219
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,260
Why are you stopping
for a minute?

220
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,230
Ohhh! Nothing.

221
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,870
Well,
why are you hopping about?

222
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,700
Look at the snowy mountains.

223
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,470
You are welcome to Morocco.

224
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,680
Ah, merci, monsieur.
Comment ça va?

225
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,210
God above.

226
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,680
-Have you got cramp?
-No.

227
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,250
Yes, you have.

228
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,190
Right, good.
Well, I've seen the view.

229
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,260
I just wanted to see
the view, and it's lovely.

230
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,900
Back on the road,
James suddenly delivered

231
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,170
a very un-James-manlike
observation.

232
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,570
My car is seriously quick!

233
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,170
It's not as fast as this.

234
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,340
Yeah, I bet it is.

235
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:51,550
James, this has a
turbocharged 1750cc engine

236
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,050
from a Fiat Punto.

237
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,020
Mine's 2L with
a twin-scroll turbocharger.

238
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:02,160
Have you noticed Hammond
is being strangely quiet
on the subject of speed?

239
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,030
Oh, just listening
to you two bicker.

240
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,130
I am a bit down on power,
if I'm honest.

241
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:14,170
I think Hammond's in a sort of
retirement home for former
distressed sports-car owners.

242
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,710
Right, next straight bit
of road, James May,

243
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,050
I will pull over
and show you
what real speed is.

244
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,420
Cows.

245
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,020
On a roof rack.
I've never seen that.

246
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:37,290
Soon, we found
a suitable stretch of road...

247
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,100
...and Hammond agreed
to be the starter.

248
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,630
-I've got launch control.
-Not interested.

249
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,770
Are you ready?
Before anyone comes.

250
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,010
In three, two, one, go!

251
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,620
Well, now,
that's just impossible!

252
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,220
It's the Zenos...

253
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,690
which means James May
has just won a drag race.

254
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:17,030
But for me, that
wasn't the biggest surprise.

255
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,340
I don't understand
why this lost,

256
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,010
because instead of
a conventional chassis,

257
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,140
it has a carbon-fibre tub,

258
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,910
like you get
in a Formula One car

259
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,010
or a McLaren P1.

260
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:36,690
And a carbon-fibre tub
makes a car...
expensive, but light.

261
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,850
Very light.

262
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,620
I'm trying to work out
why I lost that race.

263
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,890
I think it's cos your car
isn't as fast as mine.

264
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,200
That was a factor.

265
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,070
Yeah, but mine is so light.

266
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,400
How do you know it's light?

267
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,430
Every time Alfa say
how much it weighs,

268
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,270
they give a different figure.

269
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,070
Yeah,
that's because they've got

270
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,670
better things to do
than go around
weighing cars.

271
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,810
When Picasso had finished
one of his paintings,

272
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,850
he didn't say, "Oh, I wonder
how much that weighs."

273
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,150
You need to know
the weight of an Alfa
for when you resell it,

274
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,750
because you buy scrap cars
by weight.

275
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,820
With the Zenos,
that was built in Norfolk,

276
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,920
so obviously
they're gonna weigh it -
there's nothing else to do.

277
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,060
This is from Milan.

278
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:22,170
They finished making it,
and then they went into town
with one and pulled girls.

279
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,830
It's massive and
it's made of pig iron,

280
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,140
that's the problem.

281
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,140
I can see
the carbon fibre...

282
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:33,280
The weight argument raged on
for the rest of the journey.

283
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,580
So, that night,
at the hotel,

284
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,480
I came up with a plan.

285
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,090
I'm gonna weigh
all three cars

286
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,890
to prove the Alfa's
the lightest.

287
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,190
The problem with your plan
is that you'd need
a weighbridge, and...

288
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,560
-Yes.
-Well, hang on.

289
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,400
-Well, get one.
-No, there isn't one.

290
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,730
I have got the hotel brochure
here, actually,

291
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,630
and, do you know,
it's got three restaurants,

292
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,470
a spa, and a gym,
a business centre,
tennis court.

293
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,940
Mm-hm.
- But with one
glaring omission.

294
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,810
-What?
-There's no weighbridge.

295
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,210
-No!
-They haven't thought of that.
I'd knock a star off.

296
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,280
I shall build one.

297
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,120
I shall build a weighbridge,
and then you shall see.

298
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,720
-I will build a weighbridge.
-That could have been

299
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:26,930
a really useful
and interesting test,
and you've ruined it.

300
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
People are interested in
Alfa Romeos!

301
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,730
People are
interested in murders,
they don't want to see one.

302
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,840
Anyway, anyway, we'll have
more of that later on,

303
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,970
but first, it is now time
for us to engage reverse

304
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,250
and park neatly in a marked
space on Conversation Street.

305
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:55,620
Right, now,
which nation on earth
has the worst police cars?

306
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,760
Oh, that's some good
conversation.
I like that one.

307
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,760
The worst police cars,
it's definitely not the
Americans, is it,

308
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,300
because they have those
Crown Vics, and they're
rearwheel drive V8s.

309
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,540
-That's what you need.
-They're good police cars.
Not the Americans.

310
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,010
-Erm...
-It's us. It's the British.

311
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,640
Yeah.
We have those dreary little
Vauxhall diesel Astras.

312
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,080
Opels if you live here.

313
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,750
Or, if you're in America,
those miserable little
Chevrolets

314
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,550
that are actually Daewoos.
It's awful.

315
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,290
Most countries
around the world

316
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,690
would traditionally have
always had a police car
that was made there,

317
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,590
one of their own cars.
Wouldn't they?

318
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,390
And the funny thing is,
that's not what they
used to do here.

319
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,430
-In Holland?
-No.

320
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,360
You don't surprise me.

321
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:36,830
What they actually had for
many years, about 30 years,
was Porsches.

322
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,870
-What?
-The police used Porsches,
yeah. Remember? Yeah.

323
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,440
-Do you know, I'd forgotten.
You're right, they did.
-They did.

324
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,510
How did they persuade
the government?

325
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,040
It's masterful.
It's genius.

326
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,640
Absolute respect
to everybody who did it.

327
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,310
What they did was say,
"Right, we need...

328
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,950
Hm. I think we need a Porsche

329
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,020
because it's air-cooled and
the engine is at the back,

330
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,090
and that would be handy
if we have to reverse at
high speed for a long time."

331
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,360
They actually said that?

332
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,790
They did.
And this gets better.

333
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,260
And I'm not making this up.
They did say this.

334
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,300
They need a car
where you can remove the roof

335
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,400
so you can stand on the seats
to address traffic
in an emergency situation.

336
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,300
So what they need
is a 911 Targa,

337
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,870
and matching sunglasses,
I presume, yes.

338
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,780
Did they also say, "And it
comes with 911 on the back

339
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,640
which is our
telephone number"?

340
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,280
The thing is, it doesn't,
and they're still at it,

341
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,820
because the cycle cops
around here,

342
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,050
and there's a lot of them,

343
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,650
they managed to persuade
the government

344
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,020
that they need
mountain bikes.

345
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,720
-What, here?
-In Holland.

346
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,430
It's the flattest country
on earth

347
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,400
and they need mountain bikes!

348
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,600
"Yes, I might see
a mountain." What?!

349
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,930
The best thing...

350
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,470
The best thing is,
it gives us an opportunity
to have one more look

351
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,080
at a photograph of the
Dutch mountain cop police.

352
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,580
There they are.

353
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,720
- Now, I want to talk about
otters.

354
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,480
-What?
-I want to talk about otters.

355
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,650
You see, a few years ago
somebody in Holland

356
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,490
worked out that there were
only 185 otters
in the entire country.

357
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,060
Yeah, Jeremy,
it's a car show.

358
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,730
Bear with me, OK, because
I've got the figures here.

359
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,570
In 2014,
21 of these otters
were run over.

360
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:22,270
OK? In 2015,
49 were run over.

361
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,570
You only have 185 otters
in the whole country,

362
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,880
and in two years,
you've flattened 70 of them
under your cars.

363
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,350
- What is your problem
with otters?!

364
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,680
The thing is that
I don't want people to get
the wrong impression.

365
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,420
I don't want everyone
to think that Dutch people
go around murdering animals.

366
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,790
Let me explain.

367
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,190
Recently, the government here
spent 150,000 euros,

368
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,230
and that's £150,000,

369
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
£160,000, £170,000...

370
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,070
That's Brexit for you.

371
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,670
We can't even afford to put
mayonnaise on our chips now
any more.

372
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:01,010
Er... Anyway,
they spent 150,000 euros
on a bridge over a road

373
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,750
so squirrels
could cross safely.

374
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,410
We've got a picture
of the bridge.
It's a substantial thing.

375
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,150
You know this bridge?
A famous bridge?

376
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,120
-That's a squirrel bridge?
-Yeah, it's a squirrel bridge.

377
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,920
Anyway, how many squirrels
do you think have used it?

378
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,830
A squillion.

379
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,000
I see where you're going
with that one, James.
No, it isn't.

380
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,160
I've got the figures here.

381
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,470
"CCTV footage
has revealed, in 2014,

382
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,570
three squirrels used it.

383
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,370
In 2015,
it was used only twice."

384
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,680
Well, why didn't
the third squirrel
use it again in 2015?

385
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,950
-It probably got run over.
-Yeah.

386
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,820
By somebody mistaking him
for an otter.

387
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,050
Get it! Get it!

388
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,050
Now... Er...

389
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,520
You've probably read
the other day,
the Dutch are taking a view

390
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,690
on whether to allow
people to...

391
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,430
How can I put this?
Assisted dying of somebody -

392
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,770
feels as though
their life is complete, OK?

393
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,800
This is something that
occupies me a lot,

394
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,700
I'll be honest with you,
because I sometimes think...

395
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,170
"Oh, have I done enough now?"

396
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,870
- Yes.
- No.

397
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,410
No, you know, when?

398
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,210
When would it be appropriate
for me to think,

399
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,010
"Time to end."

400
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,950
- Now.
- No.

401
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:18,150
-May I get on with it?
-Yeah, do. Do it now.

402
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,990
No, what I want to say is,
OK...

403
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,590
I'll get the forms,
there can't be many.

404
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,230
The time comes... Ssh!

405
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,900
The time, I think, comes
when you stop wanting
to be an idiot.

406
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,670
That's the time
when you've done enough.

407
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,700
- I know what you mean.
- No, actually, you are right,

408
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,270
cos I think it's the moment
where you go into
a big department store,

409
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,270
and you go into
the kitchenware section,
and you see a tea cosy,

410
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,810
but you don't
put it on your head.

411
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,740
Exactly.

412
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,780
Not putting things
on your head
is a sign it's time.

413
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,520
And the time you don't want to
put gloves on your ears

414
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,450
and pretend to be a reindeer.

415
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,460
-I think that's just you,
Hammond.
-It's just me, isn't it?

416
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,460
Here's the moment
I think you know.

417
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:59,560
You're driving up a motorway.
There's a train track
next to you.

418
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,060
A train comes. It could be
one of those fast ones.

419
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,370
The day when you don't try
and race the train,

420
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,700
that's the day.

421
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,540
-Yes.
-I have to race the train.

422
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,510
I have to go faster
than the train

423
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,310
so everyone on the train
looks at me and goes,

424
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,980
"I've made the wrong
travel choice.

425
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,080
"I should have gone
in the car. It's quicker."

426
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,210
If you're ever on a train and
you look out of the window,

427
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,020
you're overtaking me
and I can't be bothered
to race you,

428
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,660
it's because I'm on my way to
the new Dutch death clinic.

429
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,690
And that is the end of
Conversation Street.

430
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,660
Now, if you have children,

431
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,530
there's every chance
they'll spend every
spare second they have

432
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,030
playing Zombie Splatter 7 ,

433
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,230
or some other such
computer game,

434
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,130
but what about
more traditional board games?

435
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,640
Kids these days say they're not
interested in such games,

436
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:46,270
but I believe they would be
if they were bigger

437
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,180
and involved cars.

438
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,920
To prove our point,

439
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,520
we've come here,
to the countryside.

440
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,420
And on the board-game front,

441
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,290
we shall start with
a classic.

442
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,830
A game where two players
try and guess where
each other's ships are,

443
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,060
and then blow them up
by firing missiles at them.

444
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,330
It's a simple game,

445
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,340
and, as such, if you want
to play it with cars,

446
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,970
you don't need much.

447
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,540
In fact, all you need

448
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:22,280
is a massive
former Cold War airfield

449
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,650
with enough tarmac
to accommodate the board
for your board game.

450
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,320
With a big enough slab
of airfield,

451
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,990
you can then lay out
your grid,

452
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,560
onto which you can place
your battleships.

453
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,090
And all you need for that

454
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,260
is several thousand pounds'
worth of old cars.

455
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,630
But not any old cars.

456
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,330
This stretch limo,
for example,

457
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,070
may have seen active service
on hundreds of hen nights,

458
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,110
but it makes
the perfect aircraft carrier.

459
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,080
And then there's
this Toyota Prius.

460
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,080
Its electric engine makes it
perfect as a submarine,

461
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,650
silent running.

462
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,090
And then there's this
Chrysler PT Cruiser
convertible.

463
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,850
There is no naval equivalent
for this car,

464
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,290
but who cares if
we blow it up?

465
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,590
Because it is,
after all, crap.

466
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:15,460
And speaking of blowing up,
we now come to the missiles.

467
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,170
For these,
you need a car that is
frightening and lethal.

468
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,670
A car that strikes fear
into other motorists.

469
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,480
And what better car
could there be for this job

470
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,810
than the magnificent G-Wiz?

471
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,450
All I needed now
was an opponent,

472
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,220
a board-game veteran,

473
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,150
a man who thinks
Call Of Duty

474
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,320
is a visit to
the lavatory.

475
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,990
That's excellent, Hammond.
You've thought of everything.

476
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,630
I know, I have.
Containers as the fence.

477
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,860
A fireman, in case things
get out of hand.

478
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,700
A health-and-safety bloke to
stop us blowing ourselves up.

479
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,900
Cars that look exactly like
ships. The lot.

480
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,140
But how will you fire
the missiles at the cars?

481
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,680
Well,
that is the real genius
in my plan.

482
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,010
Easy, powerful and proven.

483
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,910
Fire the G-Wiz missiles
with the movie cannon.

484
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,980
-You reckon
that's accurate enough?
-Well, it's a cannon.

485
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,920
But you've got to hit
a specific square.

486
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:14,720
You aim the cannon.
You adjust the trajectory
and the elevation.

487
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,660
-You can work that out?
-It's a cannon.

488
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,800
To shut James up,
I took one of the spare cars

489
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,970
to demonstrate
a practice shot.

490
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,930
Right, we're all set.

491
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,370
It's fully charged.
Pressure's good. Fire.

492
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,350
I had a better idea
for the weapons-launching
system.

493
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,170
So, there you go.

494
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,570
You call out
the grid reference
that you want,

495
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,940
and the driver just
manoeuvres the jib
exactly over that square,

496
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,710
and then drops
the G-Wiz missile.

497
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,340
It is absolutely
unerringly accurate.

498
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,980
I like that.

499
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:13,750
Unlike everything else
I've done here,
with all this stuff,

500
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,990
this is all things you can do
at home in your garden.

501
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,020
With the giant containers

502
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:25,190
making sure
neither of us could see
what the other was doing,

503
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,430
...James and I moved
our battleships into place.

504
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:35,800
And with the board laid out,
it was time to play.

505
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,170
Right, the hen-night limos
each require two hits
to be sunk.

506
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,110
Both the motorhomes,
they each require two hits
to be sunk as well.

507
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,950
And then my Prius
and your PT Cruiser,

508
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,120
they each require one
to be sunk.

509
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,790
We've got ten G-Wiz missiles
each.

510
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,990
Five hits needed to win.
Got it?

511
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,560
Yes, right.

512
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,260
Having won the toss,
James would be first to fire,

513
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,400
but I had a cunning plan
to thwart him.

514
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,970
What I've done
is put a couple of my ships
right out on the edges,

515
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,470
because James will think,
"Hammond's a bit thick,

516
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,810
and it's a typically
amateurish tactic to put
your ships on the edge,

517
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,140
so that's what
he'll have done."

518
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,150
But then he'll think,
"Hang on.

519
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,150
Even Hammond's
not that thick.

520
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,350
He just wants me
to think he's thick,

521
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,020
so he'll have put his cars
in the middle."

522
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,650
James will then
not go for the edges,

523
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,290
he'll go for the middle.

524
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,090
But my ships
will be at the edges.

525
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,700
It's like a... double,
or even a triple bluff.

526
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,360
Now, Hammond is a bit thick,
really,

527
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,430
so I reckon he'll have put his
all around the edges.

528
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,910
D2, please.

529
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,380
Fire!

530
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,830
-What was that?
-It was my limo.

531
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,160
Hit on your limo on D2,
thank you. Your shot.

532
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:13,700
Red crane driver,
I'd like C4, please. C4.

533
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,070
Fire!

534
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,680
That's a miss.

535
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,620
C4, miss.

536
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,180
Back to my original theory.

537
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,590
Hammond will have gone
along the edge,

538
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,850
I'm pretty confident
in that.

539
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,520
So is it there,
or is it there?

540
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:39,160
Green crane driver,
fire at D1.

541
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,360
Fire!

542
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,640
-Yes!
-You sank my limousine!

543
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:56,410
One sinking to me,
a miss for Admiral Hammond.

544
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,050
And you've overdone
the explosives.

545
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,390
One plan would be,
if you're playing this
at home,

546
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:06,320
do it on a day when there's
a lot of barbecues in the area.

547
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,390
That way,
people will just think,
"Well, yeah,

548
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,260
it's a big barbecue
they're having next door."

549
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,530
With my aircraft carrier
gone

550
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,200
and James's fleet unscathed,
I had to break my duck.

551
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:22,170
I'd like you to hit B2,
please.

552
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,910
Damn!

553
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,380
B2. Well...

554
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,450
Well, there's no...
Where are they?!

555
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,810
I've just got a feeling.

556
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,920
B1. B1, please.

557
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,490
Red crane driver,
can I have square A1?

558
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,430
Fire!

559
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,670
Oooh! Ooh-hoo-hoo!

560
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,440
Yes! Come on!

561
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,840
Oh, you are on the run!
That is it! Want to give up?

562
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,140
You've sunk my Cruiser.

563
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:07,050
So that's a big red kill
on A1. Boom!

564
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,050
But James wasn't taking this
lying down.

565
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:14,460
C3. Fire!

566
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,530
Yes!

567
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,600
You hit my submarine,

568
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,970
my invisible,
silent-running Prius.

569
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,240
I am losing badly.

570
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,010
I've scored only one hit,
he's scored three.

571
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,340
But then
the game started to turn,

572
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:36,780
as James had a run
of three straight misses.

573
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,210
Fire!

574
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,560
It was a miss! Ha-ha!

575
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,030
Thank you.
I'm closing down my options.

576
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:55,830
It would close your options
down further if you were to
hit rather than miss.

577
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,700
Which was exactly
what I was now doing.

578
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,000
B3, please.

579
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,240
A3, please.

580
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,810
Yes!

581
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,350
You've sunk my battleship.

582
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,580
I am raining down destruction

583
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,190
on your dwindling fleet
of doomed ships.

584
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,690
You loser. Ha-ha!

585
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,530
No, I'm not losing.
We're neck and neck.

586
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,130
Annoyingly,
James was right.

587
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,700
I still had my battleship
Winnebago,

588
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,870
and he still had his
stretched aircraft carrier,

589
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:36,700
both of which needed
two hits to destroy.

590
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,510
It was May's turn to play.

591
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,410
B2.

592
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,050
Critical stage
of the game now.

593
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,750
A hit now and I'm in trouble.

594
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,350
Fire!

595
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,590
Come on.

596
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,260
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

597
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,600
It shouldn't
feel so good, but it does.

598
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,300
Oh.

599
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,370
It's gonna be here.

600
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,540
Red crane,
target C1, please. C1.

601
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,640
Fire!

602
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,550
Hard luck, Horatio Hammond.

603
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,790
All I've got to do now,

604
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:26,790
get inside
Richard Hammond's mind.

605
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:30,960
An awful place, admittedly,
but if I can just
get in there for a second,

606
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,760
which way has he put it?

607
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,360
There and there;
there and there;
there and there?

608
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,270
C2.

609
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,380
Fire!

610
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,590
That'll be a miss.

611
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,490
That, Captain May,
was a miss!

612
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:12,270
However, while James
now had to choose between
just two squares,

613
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,800
I was looking at
a choice of six.

614
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:19,310
Red crane,
target C2, please. C2.

615
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,150
Red crane, fire!

616
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,720
I meant C3! I meant...

617
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,790
Yes!

618
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,160
Oh, yes! Yes!

619
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,700
Bollocks.

620
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,830
That mistaken shot
wasn't just a hit,

621
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,970
it had changed everything.

622
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,800
Because I said C2,
when actually I meant three,

623
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,740
in case it was there,

624
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,240
that's a kill - bang -

625
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,880
which means
it has to be there.

626
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,280
It can't be here or here,
so I've got him.

627
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,310
James, you do know
what that means, don't you?

628
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,950
Yes,
I've just worked it out.

629
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,550
I've got to get this right,
otherwise you've won.

630
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,620
-Do you want to surrender?
-No, I don't!

631
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,530
So, I was
now faced with the choice

632
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,760
that would decide the game.

633
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,670
A2 or B3?

634
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,540
A2, B3. What would
Richard Hammond do?

635
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,570
Green-crane driver...

636
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,910
Oh, God.

637
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,850
Come on, you bewildered
old spaniel - miss.

638
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,460
Right. Fire!

639
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,640
Yes! Yes!

640
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,770
Ha-ha!

641
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,580
Oh, God!

642
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,810
Ha-ha-ha!

643
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,010
Yes!

644
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,450
Hammond!

645
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,390
Best of three?

646
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,160
I bet...

647
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,370
I bet the makers
of Sony PlayStation
are quaking in their boots.

648
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,030
Well,
I wouldn't be surprised.

649
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,540
-They will go, "Oh, my..."
-I know. There's the future.

650
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,710
-That was
a total waste of time.
-Well, now, hang on.

651
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:34,410
No, we destroyed
a PT Cruiser, a Prius
and many G-Wizs.

652
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,740
Well, that's true, yes.
But James...

653
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,180
James?

654
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:45,490
Never mind. Let's move on to
Celebrity Brain Crash.

655
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,990
Yeah. Now...

656
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,530
This week...

657
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,670
This week,
we don't just have one star,

658
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,500
we have several.

659
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,370
They're one of
the biggest bands

660
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,410
ever to come out of Holland,

661
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,680
and they're going to
begin here,

662
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,310
in the sixth largest port
in the world...

663
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,820
by performing
their biggest hit,

664
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,380
by which I mean...
their hit.

665
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,150
Ladies and gentlemen,
Golden Earring!

666
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,420
And there they are.

667
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,830
I tell you what,

668
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,890
we ought to make the lights go
a bit better.

669
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,860
Can we dim the lights?
That's better.
A bit more rock 'n' roll.

670
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,100
What is their hit?

671
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,230
Well, this is Holland,
birthplace of the speed camera.

672
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,070
It's obvious.
Radar Love.

673
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,720
Oh...

674
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,860
OK,
ladies and gentlemen, erm...

675
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,360
...there's a cable's gone
into the sea here, and...

676
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,930
...Golden Earring
have been electrocuted.

677
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,430
Does that mean
they're not coming on, then?

678
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,840
Well, James,
they've been subjected to
a lethal dose of electricity

679
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,840
and are now lying
on the ground, sizzling,
so it's no.

680
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,970
-They're not, no.
-OK, OK.

681
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,940
That is a very grisly scene.
I apologise for that,
everybody.

682
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:18,050
Erm... Probably not
as grisly, though,

683
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:21,080
as if you're looking at us
from out there.

684
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,780
-Eh?
-Well, think about it.

685
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:26,120
-Oh, yeah!
-Yeah.

686
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,920
We are standing in a window
in a Dutch port,

687
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,060
bathed in red light...

688
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,160
...and we've got no trade
lining up.

689
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,530
-Nobody's here.
-No.

690
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,760
No, I know! I know!
I've had an idea.

691
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:39,770
I've had an idea
of how we can fill the time

692
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:42,270
that would have been taken up
by the late Golden Earring.

693
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,040
You see, the thing is...

694
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,770
Can we make the lights
go white again now?
Pretend that never happened.

695
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,980
Good. See, the thing is that,
in Holland,

696
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,750
there are these motorist
accessory stores, OK?

697
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:54,180
-Oh, yeah.
-They're open all night.
The place is full.

698
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,520
We went to one last night
and bought a load
of amazing stuff

699
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:00,150
you can use on the road.

700
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,460
Bring it over here.
Let's show you
a couple of things,

701
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,560
I mean, this,
for example.

702
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,090
It's an incredible
safety device.

703
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,630
Yeah.

704
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:10,430
This is very clever, because
in a lot of car crashes,

705
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,670
people bite their tongues,
sometimes off.

706
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:15,500
But by wearing this neat
safety device,

707
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,870
no way is he
biting his tongue.

708
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,810
Look at that!
Perfectly safe.
That is clever.

709
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,640
Unbelievable.
And then you can
get traffic cones

710
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,780
that fit in
the glovebox.

711
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,480
This is one here.

712
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,520
Yeah.
- It's not funny stuff,
this is safety material.

713
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:32,120
-Another one.
-These are compact, so you
can fit them in your boot.

714
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,720
The thing is, though,
OK, in America,

715
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,560
as I'm sure you know,
there are high-occupancy
vehicle lanes.

716
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,190
Er... You're not allowed
to go in them

717
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,730
unless you've got two
or more people in the car.

718
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,470
We've always been
very worried in Europe

719
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,470
that this idea is
gonna come over here,

720
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,770
but the Dutch
have it covered,

721
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,670
because in these
motorist accessory shops,

722
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,610
you can buy
inflatable people.

723
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,210
We've got one here.

724
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,310
-Very clever, this.
Very clever.
-Isn't it?

725
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,280
The only slight issue is
they do take a lot of effort
to blow up.

726
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,980
It's hard work doing.

727
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,950
It doesn't matter, though,
because here's the thing.

728
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,620
OK, if you arrive
at one of those

729
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,720
high-occupancy
vehicle lanes,

730
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,960
then you pull over
on the hard shoulder -

731
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,500
just pass the Dutchie
on the left-hand side here -

732
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,000
and then use your engine
to blow up

733
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,130
your inflatable person.

734
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,310
So I'm going to do that now,
just to show you how
unbelievably easy this is.

735
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,770
Are we ready?

736
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,140
I'll just er...
put a bit of fuel in there.

737
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,880
And here we go.

738
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,780
Why have you put your fingers
in your ears? It's only a V8.

739
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,380
It's virtually silent.

740
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,750
Here we go.

741
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,920
Behold.

742
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,960
What the...?

743
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,970
Right, the erm...

744
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,340
The inflatable person
has split. There's--

745
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,250
Oh, dear.

746
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,710
Mine's all right.

747
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:10,150
Let's move on, shall we?
Tonight we are in Morocco,

748
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:15,560
for what was supposed to be
a sensible sports-car test
of my Mazda MX-5

749
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,190
versus Bob Marley's
Norfolk-built Zenos.

750
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:23,230
Unfortunately,
the ape turned up, uninvited,

751
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,000
in a ridiculously expensive
Alfa Romeo.

752
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,600
Yes, I did.

753
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,240
And when we left the action,

754
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,010
I decided to see which of
the cars was the lightest

755
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,780
by building
some rudimentary scales -

756
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,580
a job that these two thought
would be... beyond me.

757
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,790
Despite the cynicism
of my colleagues,

758
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,830
the next morning,
my scales were ready.

759
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,770
-Wow.
-Yeah.

760
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:10,650
Even more startling
was Jeremy's choice
of counterweight.

761
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,510
How are you gonna
get it on there?

762
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:14,620
-It's gonna jump.
-Oh, yeah,
they're big jumpers, cows.

763
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,720
-Look, it wants to.
-He's limbering up,

764
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,620
he's getting ready,
you can tell.

765
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,320
-Up you come.
-It's not gonna jump.
They can't jump.

766
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,960
Up you come.

767
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,830
On the off chance that
this isn't a jumping cow,

768
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:28,660
which it might not be,
I think you need a ramp.

769
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,630
You hold that.
I shall go and make a ramp.

770
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,270
-Hello. Hello.
-Hello, nice cow.

771
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:36,370
Oh, it's bonded with you,
Jeremy. It's bonded.

772
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,870
Soon,
without any help at all,

773
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,780
I had fashioned
a makeshift ramp.

774
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,980
Very good. Well done.

775
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,880
That was quick and effective.

776
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:50,120
Unfortunately,
the cow had wandered off,

777
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,450
so I had to draft in
a substitute.

778
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,290
Go on, camel.

779
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,660
-Come on, camel.
-Come on.

780
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,230
Come on, camel. Come on.

781
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,660
Come on. Come on.

782
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,800
He's not gonna go on.

783
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,570
Up you come. Come on.

784
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,270
Come on.
Can you push him? Oh, no.

785
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,910
Not really,
cos they kick your balls off
if you do that. Let me...

786
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:13,780
David Attenborough
has never said that.

787
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,810
Eventually,
I had some success.

788
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,280
This is good.
We are getting there.

789
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:20,550
We are building up
a big Christmas dinner.

790
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,220
And then
the original cow came back.

791
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:27,250
- Come on.
- Dr Thinklittle.

792
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,460
Come on. Come on.
My camel's going
over here.

793
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,860
Good cow.

794
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,300
-Tragically, however...
-...it's not enough.

795
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,970
Could you go
and get another cow?

796
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:41,770
Come on, small cow.

797
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,440
He's on. Right, excellent.

798
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,810
-Good, good, good.
-Jeremy?

799
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,270
-Yes?
-This is far...

800
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,210
-Oh, my God!
-I don't want to be here
for this!

801
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,180
I'm on some scales.
Its carrot's come out.

802
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,250
-Are they both boy cows?
-Yeah, they're both boys.

803
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,850
Yeah. Oh, no.
This is quite bad.

804
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,590
-I'm... Yeah.
-I really am alarmed.

805
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,720
I'm stuck on a porn set.

806
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,290
Am I part of this?
Is this a threesome?

807
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,560
He's trod on a turk...
No, he hasn't.

808
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:11,030
More importantly, the whole
cast of our porn film

809
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,370
still weighed less
than the Mazda.

810
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,870
Chickens. Hello, chickies.

811
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,510
-It's not enough, is it?
-No.

812
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:22,310
It doesn't make... Jeremy,
this is complete nonsense.

813
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,280
Cow sex! No!

814
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:28,120
Come on, we go. On you go.

815
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,920
I'm not convinced
that this isn't...

816
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,790
Oh, the goat's escaped.

817
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:34,390
At this stage,
we explained to Jeremy

818
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:38,330
that animals cannot be used
as counterweights.

819
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,060
Right, no,
you may have a point.

820
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:42,760
I think it's better
if I kill them.

821
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:45,270
-What?
-Well, if they're dead,
they won't mind.

822
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:50,770
This plan
made the job much easier.

823
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,780
Oh, hello!

824
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,340
My experiment has worked.

825
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:57,510
Wow! We have a figure.

826
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,910
For the record,
it weighs two cows,

827
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,980
two legs of cows -
brackets, rear -

828
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:03,480
one camel and three goats.

829
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,090
That's incredible!

830
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:07,350
The most exciting thing
I've ever been involved in.

831
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,790
Having established
the weight of the Mazda,

832
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,960
it was time to do the Zenos.

833
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,800
Hammond, reverse off
down my superb ramp.

834
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,000
-Whoa! It's...
-I'm gonna walk this way.

835
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:24,310
Why is it doing that? James
counterbalances with you.

836
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:26,410
Hang on.
That's not gone well.

837
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,340
- Yeah, it has.
- No, it's moved!

838
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,680
Oh, this is...
Now the back wheels
have come off!

839
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,820
Somebody get on!
The whole crew!

840
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,650
What's happened?

841
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,390
- Oh, God!

842
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:41,690
No, there's no point
doing that, Hammond.

843
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,830
We need to
think this through.

844
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,200
Hang on. I've got an idea.

845
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,630
If you get off there,
this side will go up.

846
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,430
Then you put the ramp
under the back wheels
of the Mazda

847
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,900
when it comes down again.

848
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:58,470
-So you all need to get off.
-Right, I'm off.

849
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,080
Hang on.
Are you going up now?

850
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:05,680
-I think so.
-No, we need...

851
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,210
I know,
everybody has to go there.

852
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,120
-On that side. Yeah.
-Everybody, all the crew.

853
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:13,090
All the chunkier lads,
if you get on that one.

854
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,020
How did we get
into this position?

855
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:17,220
Somebody pull on the front,
just to tip it.

856
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:19,860
And then
we will move this ramp.

857
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,730
Hello? Can we have all of...

858
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,930
- He's down now!
- Am I gonna die?

859
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:27,030
Am I dead? Am I dead?

860
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,870
Thanks to our fluent French,

861
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:35,280
we were able to get the
forklift driver to help us.

862
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,180
The Mazda...

863
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,450
Erm...

864
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,450
Reverse à vous la ramp,

865
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,250
avec introduce la ramp...
Yeah.

866
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,390
Then
the authorities arrived.

867
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,730
-Ah, les animaux?
-Yes, les animaux.

868
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,130
Wait. Erm...

869
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,330
Is it a Problème?

870
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,400
James, it's not acceptable
in Morocco

871
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:04,910
to kill animals to establish
the weight of a car, so...

872
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,010
It's not acceptable
in Morocco?

873
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:09,040
Having established
nothing at all,

874
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:10,580
we were all ordered
to leave,

875
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,410
which made Hammond
very cheesed off with me.

876
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,480
You're a bloody idiot!

877
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:16,920
Funny!

878
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:20,250
I think he's angry,
isn't he?

879
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,360
And I wasn't in James's
good books, either.

880
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:26,360
Clarkson!

881
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:27,430
What's the matter?

882
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:30,130
I want the steering wheel
back, you muppet!

883
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,570
-I haven't got it.
-You have!

884
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,000
I haven't. One of those goats
has got it.

885
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,970
Goats can't pick things up.

886
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:46,250
With his wheel
retrieved, we set off.

887
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:48,820
And soon,
James and I decided

888
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:51,490
something
needed to be done.

889
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,490
Jeremy, are you there?

890
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:55,660
Yes, I am.

891
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,160
Oh, good. Erm...

892
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,760
Look, just...

893
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:01,130
Er...
Just bear with me, OK?

894
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,430
This isn't really working
as well as we'd hoped
at the moment,

895
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,600
so we think
it would be better
if we went our own way

896
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:11,270
and you went yours.

897
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:16,210
Are you in on this, James?

898
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,980
Well, the thing is
that we had conceived
quite an interesting test

899
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:24,420
between
an everyday sports car
and a hardcore sports car.

900
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:26,720
And, I mean,
it's not you.

901
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:29,990
But, I mean, really,
it's the Alfa.
The Alfa doesn't fit.

902
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,830
Right, well, OK. Erm...

903
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:35,730
I'll leave you two alone.

904
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,360
And I do mean alone,

905
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:41,000
because... I'm going to take
the film crews with me.

906
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,010
Now that we're alone,

907
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,280
I could prattle on for hours

908
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:57,020
about what
the Alfa Romeo badge means,

909
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,350
and how,
with its carbon-fibre tub,

910
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:01,120
this isn't really
a sports car.

911
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:05,130
It's more a... scaled-down,
cut-price LaFerrari.

912
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:08,100
But I've had a better idea.

913
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:16,470
What I did was find
a wonderful piece of road...

914
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,840
...and then shut up,

915
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:25,610
so the pictures
could do the talking.

916
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,870
That's the thing
about this Alfa -

917
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,940
if you talk about it,
you're gonna criticise it.

918
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:05,550
If you just look at it...
you're gonna fall in love.
Oh, hello.

919
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,150
Mate! Mate!
Thank God you're here!

920
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,050
What's the matter with him?

921
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:14,820
Well, for the first time
in my life,

922
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:18,460
I'm rather glad you're here,
because...

923
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,030
he thinks he's discovered
an ancient civilisation.

924
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,660
And he got very excited,

925
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:25,170
and I couldn't say,
"No, Hammond, it's not real."

926
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,530
It's a film set.

927
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,300
That is where they filmed
Asterix And Obelix ,

928
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:31,710
and that is where they film
Game Of Thrones .

929
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,440
Yeah, I know that,
but he thinks it's real.

930
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,280
He thinks
aliens have come down

931
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:38,750
and that everything
that universities in Britain
know about Ancient Egypt,

932
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:41,250
Ancient Greece,
Ancient Rome, is all wrong.

933
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:49,390
Which feet
last trod these steps?

934
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:52,230
Were they even human?

935
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,930
Maybe they were that big.

936
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,300
This was actually used in
The Jewel Of The Nile .

937
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:01,670
-Was it?
-Yeah.

938
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:05,840
Starring Kathleen Turner,
Michael Douglas,

939
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,840
and, I think, Danny DeVito.

940
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:10,580
Hammond probably thinks
that it's a spaceship.

941
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,680
That's how they got here.

942
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,220
It's like touching hands...

943
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:20,450
...across the millennia.

944
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,790
These were not
primitive people.

945
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:29,530
While Indiana Hammond

946
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,930
continued
his deluded ramblings,

947
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,670
I came up with an idea.

948
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,910
I tell you what this place
has never been used as.

949
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:41,240
-What?
-A racetrack.

950
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:45,450
Having convinced Richard

951
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,980
we wouldn't anger
the sleeping gods,

952
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:52,890
we made a circuit
from the roads running
through the studio lot.

953
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:59,090
And then I went off
to get changed.

954
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,400
Wow! Hammond,
Roger Moore isn't here.

955
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:03,460
No, he's not, is he?
What is that?

956
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:05,870
It's my Alfa Romeo
racing suit.

957
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:07,700
-Is it?
-Yes, it is. Look at that.

958
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:09,440
- Oh!
- Peacock lining.

959
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,670
That makes it better.

960
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,270
It's the Dick
from Del Monte.

961
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,140
The Cock from Del Monte.

962
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,080
The Dick from Del Monte,
he says, "Ra-ra-ra!"

963
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:19,150
- In an Alfa Romeo--
- This is tremendous!

964
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,120
In an Alfa Romeo...

965
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:25,020
...looking good is more
important than looking
where you're going.

966
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:26,850
-That's a shame.
-When are you gonna do that?

967
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:32,460
It was now time
to get down to business.

968
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:35,860
But first, we went out
for some sighting laps.

969
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:40,300
Whoa!

970
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:42,840
It's all skiddy!

971
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,770
- Oh, this is very narrow.
- James did this.

972
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:49,710
That's only an inch wider
than my car, you stupid man!

973
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,140
But I'm in!

974
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:52,880
I'm into ancient Egypt!

975
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,390
Oh, wow! Look at that!
Paintings and everything!

976
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:02,860
I'm gonna go around
the unconvincing fighter jet.

977
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:10,130
Understeering
like mad, that's not good.
I must remember that.

978
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,700
The problem you have in
the 4C is it's mid-engined,

979
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:14,800
which means,
on a surface like this,

980
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:16,370
there's no weight
over the front,

981
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,470
and that means...
no grip.

982
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,710
Unlike the other two,
this is front-engined,

983
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,580
so there's less weight
on the back end,

984
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:27,510
which would make
for a livelier back end

985
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:30,020
and more time
enjoying oversteer.

986
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:34,360
Oh, I'm gonna spin!

987
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:38,730
That's bad!
That's too much oversteer.

988
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,360
Game Of Thrones set.

989
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:43,500
I mustn't think about
Khaleesi.

990
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,500
Oh, no! Thinking about
Khaleesi, it's bad!

991
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:48,600
Don't think about Khaleesi!

992
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:50,370
No!

993
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,040
Holy crap!

994
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:55,440
It's a castle!

995
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,610
God, no! Nearly hit
a bit of Nazareth then.

996
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,780
Jesus
would have been displeased.

997
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,660
Having got to know

998
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,720
our weird
and demanding track,

999
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:13,990
we began the timed laps,
with James going first

1000
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,600
in his lightweight,
powerful Norfolk-mobile.

1001
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:21,230
Right, are we ready,
James May?

1002
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,800
In three, two, one... Begin!

1003
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:35,980
Oh, where's the bend?
I don't...

1004
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,420
Oh, balls!

1005
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,290
You know,
what worries me most of all,

1006
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:47,630
is the poor little man
who's mortgaged his house
to start Zenos.

1007
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:49,700
And that he's lent it to us
on the television.

1008
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,230
"And which one's driving it?
Which...?"

1009
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,570
"Oh, no."

1010
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:57,500
Right, now what do I do?

1011
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,640
After my first-corner
cock-up,

1012
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:06,580
I was on the back foot,
trying to make up time.

1013
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,950
Heading for Nazareth,
I think.

1014
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:19,030
Whoa!

1015
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:20,630
All over the place!

1016
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:29,940
Round and round the thingy.

1017
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,510
Whoa!

1018
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,980
Fast, faster. Faster.

1019
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:58,260
Well...
this only goes up to
999 hours, sadly.

1020
00:56:58,330 --> 00:56:59,570
Right.

1021
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:01,940
But it's OK,
you were just in that time.

1022
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:02,770
Yeah, mm.

1023
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,240
James,
did you manage to drive

1024
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,640
whilst dragging your face
along the ground?

1025
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:08,310
A lot of dust comes in.

1026
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:11,180
- Why don't you wind
the windows up?

1027
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,250
You're funny men.

1028
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:17,020
Next, it was
the turn of John Travolta.

1029
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:20,620
Never has anybody
looked quite so good...

1030
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:22,090
...on a timed lap.

1031
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:28,030
In three, two, one... Go!

1032
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,900
Right,
let's make this count.

1033
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:42,540
Narrow!

1034
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:53,190
Sideways in linen!

1035
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:09,200
Game Of Thrones set.

1036
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,810
Understeering...

1037
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,620
Turn! Turn!

1038
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:28,620
Come on, let's get
that turbocharger singing!

1039
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,960
Kill it now!

1040
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:49,980
Well, he arrived.

1041
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,310
Finally,
Sir John Blashford-Hammond.

1042
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,750
-Ready?
-Yes.

1043
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:59,090
In three, two, one... Go!

1044
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:03,790
Right, this is it.

1045
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:24,080
I can't afford
a single error.

1046
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:42,330
Uh-oh! This is a hot lap!

1047
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,510
Here he comes.

1048
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:57,680
Ooh!

1049
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:01,850
No!

1050
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,080
And with that,
back to the tent.

1051
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:10,420
Smashed it.
Smashed it.

1052
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:12,990
-Hang on a minute.
-What?

1053
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:16,400
You know that
Windmills Of Your Mind
sequence in the car?

1054
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:19,170
-Yeah.
-You made the Alfa
look really good in that.

1055
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:21,200
-Yes.
-What if somebody buys one?

1056
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:22,840
You don't want that
on your conscience.

1057
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,170
What do you mean?
It was a brilliant... What?

1058
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:28,910
Anyway, anyway, I have
the results here of the laps.

1059
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,010
And er...
well, in third place,

1060
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,750
you in the Zenos;
second place,
you in the Alfa;

1061
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:34,920
first place, the winner
was me in the Mazda.

1062
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,380
But it was
a hollow victory,

1063
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:40,350
because I ruined an
ancient piece of sculpture.

1064
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:43,090
Yes,
but here's the thing, OK?

1065
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:46,390
After the weight test
and the speed test we did,

1066
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:49,100
we've learned...

1067
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,900
-...nothing.
-Yeah, it's nothing.
Nothing at all.

1068
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,970
Literally nothing at all.

1069
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:55,040
And on that
terrible disappointment,

1070
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,240
I'm afraid it's time to end.

1071
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,040
Thank you so much
for watching.

1072
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,310
-See you next week. Goodbye.
-Goodbye!
