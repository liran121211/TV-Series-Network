00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,800
(CHEERING)

4
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,560
- Here we go.
- Hello!

5
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,440
Greetings, everybody!
Thank you.

6
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,440
- Thanks very much.
- Hello.

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,640
JEREMY: Hello. Hello.

8
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,280
- Hello, everybody.
- Hello.

9
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,120
(CHEERING CONTINUES)

10
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,680
RICHARD: Thank you.
Thank you.

11
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,480
- JEREMY: Loud!
- That's a big one.

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,760
JEREMY: Thank you so much!

13
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,240
Welcome. And in this edition of the
world's most exciting motoring show...

14
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,040
...a maroon Skoda...

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,080
...a silver car of some sort...

16
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,800
...and an elderly German man
says, "I don't like jumps."

17
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,360
I-I don't like jumps.

18
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,480
(CHEERING)

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,640
- There's a lot.
- It's a good one. Good one.

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,640
And there's that diarrhoea-coloured
Audi as well, isn't there?

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,240
Yeah. Yeah, there's that.

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,440
- And you kill a Chinese person.
- (LAUGHTER)

23
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,840
But we start with Lamborghini.

24
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,120
They've just launched
a more hard-core,

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,720
more exciting version
of the Huracán,

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,920
and Richard Hammond
was very keen to try it out.

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,400
- I was.
- Yeah, he was.

28
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,680
So we put the air ambulance
on standby...

29
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,800
(LAUGHTER)

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,960
...and off he went.

31
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,920
RICHARD: Here it is.

32
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,200
It's called
the Huracán Performante.

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,560
And whereas the standard
Huracán costs £155,000,

34
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,240
this version comes in
at £208,000.

35
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,680
So what do you get
for the extra £50,000?

36
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,160
Well, to be honest, on paper,
not a lot.

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,360
You only get 29 more horsepower,

38
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,160
up from 602 to 631.

39
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,640
And 30 more torques.

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,560
Hm.

41
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,160
So, while the original

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,320
tops out at 202 miles an hour,

43
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,880
this can do, erm, the same.

44
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,520
And the 0-60 time

45
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,560
goes down by a whopping
two tenths of a second,

46
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,680
from 3.1 to 2.9.

47
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,160
Now, admittedly, we are starting
from a very high baseline,

48
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,640
and you have probably just seen some
pictures of a car going very fast.

49
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,640
But... 55 grand more?

50
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,560
When do you start seeing
something for your money?

51
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,480
Fortunately,
in quite a few places.

52
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,280
For starters, some proper work has
gone into making the Performante

53
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,760
look more dramatic
than a normal Huracán.

54
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,240
This car has much more of the
get-your-camera-phone-out appeal

55
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
you expect from a Lamborghini.

56
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,640
I particularly like the
material this wing's made from.

57
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,000
It's actually chopped-up carbon
fibre bonded in a resin.

58
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,920
So not only does it look rather
good, it's also very light.

59
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,400
And because they've
used it all over the place,

60
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,440
they've shaved 40kg off
the weight of the car.

61
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,000
And you would notice that
on a mountain road.

62
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,400
And then we come
to the soundtrack.

63
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,000
Again, if we compare it to the standard
car, the Huracán makes an OK noise.

64
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,600
But the Performante comes with
a new exhaust, and that...

65
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,440
(REVVING)

66
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,680
Oh-ho!

67
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,480
That is awesome, that is!

68
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,360
Love the sound of a V10.

69
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,480
Like having 10,000 wolves
at your back.

70
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,080
(LAUGHS)

71
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,360
But there's more to the Performante
than just animalistic howling.

72
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,000
The car is also equipped with something
called Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva,

73
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,720
or ALA for short.

74
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,760
And what it claims to be is a
very clever aerodynamic system.

75
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,920
Basically, you have moving
flaps in the front spoiler,

76
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,000
and moving air ducts at the back that
control the airflow to the rear wing.

77
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,160
Now, if you want to go fast in a
straight line, you need less downforce,

78
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,320
so the ducts open so they
direct more air under the wing.

79
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,200
Right, so,
fast in a straight line.

80
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,640
That's as good an excuse for a
gratuitous drag race as we've ever had.

81
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,160
Just a shame there isn't
some local motorist

82
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,840
out for a drive
in a Ferrari 458 Speciale,

83
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,760
or... something...
something that...

84
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,040
Oh, what a stroke of luck!

85
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,040
- Morning.
- Fancy seeing you here.

86
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,320
Yeah. To be honest,
I was just out for a drive

87
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,400
and I stopped to sort of,
you know,

88
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,840
marvel at the mystery
and wonder of God's creation.

89
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,160
Yeah. Well,
I don't know if you're aware,

90
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,840
but you happen to have pulled up
on the start line of a drag race.

91
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,120
- Have I?
- Yeah.

92
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,320
RICHARD: Seeing as
our cars are so similar,

93
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,920
would you mind accompanying me
to the other end of this runway

94
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,760
in a drag-race-type fashion?

95
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,120
- Yeah, all right.
- Excellent.

96
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,640
Good.

97
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
It's just worked out
that way today.

98
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,040
That's blind luck that
that man happened to be in...

99
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,360
in... in the logical
competitor for this car.

100
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,480
(REVVING)

101
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,960
And we are away!

102
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,080
Avanti!

103
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,560
That aero now doing its business to
make this thing as fast as possible...

104
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,160
in a straight line.

105
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,240
And, dear God!

106
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,320
(LAUGHS)

107
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,080
- Ha!
- Oh, no!

108
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,560
I beat the local man in his 458
Speciale, by some considerable margin.

109
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,760
But the Lambo's clever aero
system is equally impressive

110
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,760
when you get to the end of a
straight and arrive at a corner.

111
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,200
(TYRES SQUEAL)

112
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,240
Oh!

113
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,000
As I go into a corner, I need more
downforce to give me more grip.

114
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,760
So the flaps and ducts are
adjusting to do just that.

115
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,680
(TYRES SQUEAL)

116
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,160
It's pressing down,
it's giving it grip.

117
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,520
More than that, it can
operate individual sides

118
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,480
so it can work individual wheels
mid-corner to dial up the grip.

119
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,440
That's clever.
Very, very clever.

120
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,400
(TYRES SQUEAL)

121
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,000
And let me give you some hard
evidence of just how clever.

122
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,360
The Porsche 918, my favourite
out-of-this-world hypercar,

123
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,200
went round the Nurburgring in
six minutes and 57 seconds.

124
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,840
This thing,
five seconds quicker.

125
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,960
As a driving machine, the Performante
is one hell of an experience.

126
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,200
But there's
even more to it than that.

127
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,360
What Lamborghini have done with
this is hit a real sweet spot.

128
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,800
It can corner like a race car

129
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,640
and shatter trees
with its engine noise,

130
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,160
but it hasn't been turned into some
hard-core track-day abomination.

131
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,040
I've got air-con and Apple
connecty stuff in here.

132
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,880
In the comfort sense, it's very much
like driving a standard Huracán.

133
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,920
And that last point is why
this car is so special.

134
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,840
A lifetime ago, on a car show
in a galaxy far, far away,

135
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,880
I reviewed the original Huracán
and was left feeling a bit sad

136
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,760
because it lacked that drama,
that thrill-delivery system

137
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,560
that a Lamborghini
should have and be.

138
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,680
Well, finally it's here. The
whole package is complete.

139
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,280
This is what the Huracán should
have been from the start.

140
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,040
It's brilliant.

141
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,000
(CHEERING)

142
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
RICHARD: That was
a really... amazing thing.

143
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,880
I don't see how Ferrari
always lose a race...

144
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,200
when it's some punter's car, and
when they provide the car, they win.

145
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,440
RICHARD: Amazing, isn't it?

146
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,280
I actually, erm...

147
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,400
I drove a Performante
the other day,

148
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,640
and I pulled out
to overtake a Peugeot,

149
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,640
put my foot down,
and the noise was so enormous

150
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,520
I genuinely believed the
engine had actually exploded.

151
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,720
- (LAUGHTER)
- I've never heard a sound like it.

152
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,400
It is pretty loud.

153
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,120
But it's not pretty loud,
it's incredibly loud.

154
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,520
It can't possibly pass any,
you know, regulations.

155
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,200
- It doesn't need to be, it's Italian.
- It is Italian, that's true.

156
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,080
It's also...
It's also fantastic.

157
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,000
I think I'm right in... No,
I know I'm right in saying

158
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,960
it's currently my favourite
supercar of the moment.

159
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,200
Oh, it's definitely mine.
Supercar.

160
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,920
Absolutely adorable,
it really is.

161
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,560
Anyway, we must now find how fast
it goes round the Eboladrome.

162
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,520
- (REVVING)
- Come on, let's have it!

163
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,480
JEREMY: And she's off!

164
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,240
A searing start,
and a ferocious howl

165
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,120
as the Huracán powers
onto the Isn't Straight.

166
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,160
Grabbing at the gears to keep
that amazing V10 on song.

167
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,120
And carrying some serious
speed through there.

168
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,400
No let-up as she drives down
towards Your Name Here.

169
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,280
Despite being
the hard-core model,

170
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,760
the Performante is still four-wheel-drive
like the standard Huracán.

171
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,080
And that clearly translates
into serious mechanical grip.

172
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,080
Now, unleashing all 631 horsepower
for the blast back down the Isn't.

173
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,920
You really can't beat a normally-aspirated
engine for sheer visceral wailing.

174
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,960
It's superb.

175
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,080
Old Lady's House.

176
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,800
Grip, and that active aero
trickery staving off understeer.

177
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,960
On the bumpy run down
to Substation.

178
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Is it going to be OK
through there?

179
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,360
Yep, absolutely no problem working
the carbon-ceramic brakes.

180
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,760
Flies round Field of Sheep
and across the line!

181
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,520
(CHEERING)

182
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,920
- That looked good. That looked fast.
- It looks quick.

183
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,800
- Is it, though?
- Yeah, that's it.

184
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,680
- That was properly... darting.
- It looked it.

185
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,240
Anyway,

186
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
we must now find out

187
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,200
how far up the board

188
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,680
the Huracán goes.

189
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,600
RICHARD: Oh, hello.
Oh, hang on. Oh-ho!

190
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,520
- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
- JEREMY: Bloody hell.

191
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,440
One sixteen-eight - that's the fastest
road-legal car we've ever had round there.

192
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,920
- It's not road-legal.
- It's Italian.

193
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,200
- Same thing.
- Everything in Italian's road-legal.

194
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,560
Anyway, it is now time for us to
plant some daffodils of opinion

195
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,320
on the roundabout of chat at the
end of Conversation Street.

196
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,200
- (JAZZ MUSIC)
- (LAUGHTER)

197
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,160
Sorry.

198
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,560
- (LAUGHTER)
- So sorry.

199
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,080
That's the best thing that's
going to come out of your mouth

200
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,440
for the next seven minutes.

201
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,040
Ouch!

202
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,520
So erm, conversation,
sticking with supercars.

203
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,440
Many new ones have arrived
recently, and we have one here.

204
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,360
If you have a look,
that is the Devel Sixteen.

205
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,600
Now, that's a 12.3-litre
V16 quad-turbo engine.

206
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,080
It's two Chevy engines
glued together.

207
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,560
And it has a top speed, according to
the makers, of 320 miles an hour.

208
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,040
(SCOFFS) Really?

209
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,600
- Three hundred and...
- That's what they say.

210
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,840
You can test that one, Hammond.

211
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,200
- Three hundred and twenty?
- That's what they say.

212
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,160
Anyway, if you don't fancy
the Devel Sixteen,

213
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,800
you could try the
Ikeya Formula IF-02RDS,

214
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,200
the Apollo Intensa Emozione,

215
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,160
the er, Dallara Stradale,

216
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,920
the er, Aspark Owl.

217
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,880
What? The what? Owl?

218
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,800
- The Aspark Owl, yes.
- You can't call a car an Owl.

219
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,480
- (LAUGHTER)
- JAMES: The Vencer Sarthe,

220
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,640
the Arrinera Hussarya,

221
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,600
the Mazzanti
Evantra Millecavalli,

222
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,040
and the Hennessey Venom.

223
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,520
No, I'm sorry, this is just ridiculous.
Seriously, they're all new supercars?

224
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,680
- They're all new supercars.
- That's absurd!

225
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
- And then, from America...
- Oh, God!

226
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,520
...there's the Glickenhaus
SCG 004S.

227
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,080
And from Denmark,
the Zenvo TS1 GT.

228
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,400
Right, we've got the idea. Every single
person in the world has suddenly decided,

229
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,400
"You know, I can make
a supercar myself."

230
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,840
Yeah, it looks that way.
Yeah.

231
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,800
The problem I've got
with all of this is

232
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,720
it's not like we're
spoiled for choice already.

233
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,680
I mean, you've got Ferrari,
Lamborghini,

234
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,600
you've got Bugatti,
McLaren, Ford, even Audi.

235
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,680
Yeah, but what if you want
a supercar with no heritage

236
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,120
that's built in someone's shed?

237
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,120
If that's what you really want.

238
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,480
- And that you can't get serviced anywhere.
- RICHARD: Exactly.

239
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,400
Did any car there
appeal to anyone here?

240
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,560
(CROWD MURMURS)

241
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,160
You'd all rather have a Lamborghini
Performante than anything there?

242
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,440
So that's total failure
for all those people.

243
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,600
What you've just looked at there
is 27 future bankruptcies.

244
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,440
(LAUGHTER)

245
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,640
Now, we have always argued
that women, whatever they say,

246
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,440
are impressed when a man performs a
perfectly executed handbrake turn.

247
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,960
Oh, it's absolutely true.

248
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,120
We've all been watching Sir Attenborough's
fish programme, haven't we, yeah?

249
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,200
Yeah, Blue Planet.
Unbelievable, OK?

250
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,680
Now, the thing is, every
single week you see, OK,

251
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,880
man fish comes along
with his lady fish there.

252
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,040
Man fish can make his face swell up -
it's huge - like a satellite dish.

253
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,200
Lady fish: "I'm not bothered.
I'm not bothered."

254
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,440
- But she is. She is.
- RICHARD: Yeah.

255
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,840
And then she's going,
"I like his huge face,"

256
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,480
and then they do sex, or whatever it
is fish do, and then they have babies.

257
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,920
Now, that massive face
that a fish can do,

258
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,200
that's basically the same
as the handbrake turn.

259
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,440
- (LAUGHTER)
- All those birds that dance about.

260
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,720
We've got the handbrake,
birds can dance about.

261
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,080
- It's all part of nature's dance of love.
- Exactly.

262
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,040
But the problem has been, of course, most
modern cars now have electronic handbrakes.

263
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,280
You can't do a handbrake turn
with one of those.

264
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,000
That's why Tinder's
become so big.

265
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,000
- Yeah, you have to...
- (LAUGHTER)

266
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,680
You have to swipe right because
you can't slide left any more.

267
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,240
- That's what's going on.
- Well, so that's been the problem.

268
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,080
With electronic handbrakes we
can't conduct this mating ritual.

269
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,920
Ford have noticed this, given it some
thought, and they've come up with this.

270
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,600
It's an after-market part
that you fit to your car.

271
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,880
They call it the drift stick.

272
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,400
- Oh, they ought to call it the love handle.
- Yeah.

273
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,040
(LAUGHTER)

274
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,040
But the point is, what it
does, it overrides the ABS,

275
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,880
and you can actually perform
proper handbrake turns in that.

276
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,560
Girls are going to say,
if you pull that,

277
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,280
"That was ridiculous
and you frightened me."

278
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,360
- What they actually mean is, "I'm hot."
- Yeah.

279
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,760
- (LAUGHTER)
- Come on. Yeah, admit it.

280
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,280
- You're impressed by a handbrake turn, aren't you?
- Just the thought of it.

281
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
If you say no,
that's just part of it.

282
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,560
I've never been in a car with...

283
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,880
You've never been in a car with
someone who's done a handbrake turn?

284
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,760
- Oh, hello!
- (LAUGHTER)

285
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,960
JEREMY: Ooh!

286
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,080
Are you together?

287
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,000
RICHARD: What are you doing,
man? What's wrong with you?

288
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,720
What is wrong with you?
How do you...?

289
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,280
You drove here today,
huge fields everywhere.

290
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,240
You didn't think,
"I'll give it some of that"?

291
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,000
RICHARD: Get out there
and impress her.

292
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,720
On the way out...
Just mind the sheep.

293
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,880
Right, listen.
Bentley has announced

294
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,640
a new version of their big
four-by-four, the Bentayga, OK?

295
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,960
Er... Which they say
is for shooting enthusiasts.

296
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
We've got a picture here, look. It's
got this kind of chest in the back

297
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,240
which has, you know, space for your
guns and refreshments, and so on.

298
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:24,080
However, I know that whoever designed that
has never been shooting in their lives.

299
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,360
How do you know?

300
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,880
Well, because if we examine the refreshments
that have been photographed here,

301
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,720
you will find that they
have fitted it with...

302
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,840
rose lemonade
and elderflower juice.

303
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,120
- (LAUGHTER)
- Now, I'm sorry to say...

304
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,520
No, I'm sorry to have to say this, but
has anyone here been shooting ever?

305
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,240
- (MURMURING)
- Yeah, you have?

306
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,760
As you will know, a shooting
day is an armed drinks party.

307
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,560
- There's no place for shit like that.
- (LAUGHTER)

308
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,280
You turn up with elderflower juice at
a shoot and the host will shoot you.

309
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,640
- What?
- WOMAN: Middle East market.

310
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,040
- Middle Eastern market?
- Oh, she might have a point with that.

311
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,000
Could be.

312
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,720
Don't come here with your bloody
sensible, rational views.

313
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,880
(LAUGHTER)

314
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,160
No, actually it's funny you should
mention the Middle Eastern market,

315
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,920
because they've also done one for
fly-fishing, which happens in the Yemen.

316
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,400
- Yeah.
- (LAUGHTER)

317
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,480
- JAMES: It does.
- (LAUGHTER CONTINUES)

318
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,360
(APPLAUSE)

319
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,680
JEREMY: And it gets better.

320
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,360
And falconry.

321
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,600
And falconry's really big
in the Middle East.

322
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,200
What about dogging?

323
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,480
(LAUGHTER)

324
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,320
- What about dogging?
- Well, why don't they do one for dogging?

325
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,040
It's a countryside pursuit, and more people
do that than do falconry, don't they?

326
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,080
- Well, yeah, you're prob... probably right.
- Yeah.

327
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,080
- From what I've heard.
- RICHARD: Well, they should.

328
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,200
- But what would you have in a dogging Bentayga, then?
- (LAUGHTER)

329
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,880
Well, you'd open the drawers
and there'd be like...

330
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,800
- MAN: Wet wipes.
- Wet wipes!

331
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,200
- (LAUGHTER)
- Wet wipes. Good one.

332
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,720
RICHARD: Straight away.
JEREMY: Yeah, wet wipes. Good one.

333
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,800
- Condoms.
- JEREMY: Yeah.

334
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,080
Condoms. Maybe like a camera
and a whip, or something.

335
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,120
No, on the... I reckon, on the basis of Bentley
thinking that's a shooting, er, chest,

336
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,640
that a Bentley dogging Bentayga,

337
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,520
they would literally have
a blanket, a bowl and a lead.

338
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,560
(LAUGHS)

339
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,520
Now, two US Navy aircrew
people have been in trouble,

340
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,440
er... for using the vapour trail
from the back of their fighter jet

341
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,480
to paint pictures in the sky.

342
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,160
We've got a shot
of their work here.

343
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,120
JEREMY: Erm...
RICHARD: Oh, it's...

344
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,320
That's good work. It's
very neat. It's neatly done.

345
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,840
JEREMY:
It is neatly done. Now...

346
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,960
Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker - obviously from
the US Navy - he's not happy about this.

347
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,080
He says, "Immature acts of a sexual
nature have no place in naval aviation."

348
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,600
Well, I'm sorry, but the plane they
were flying when they did that

349
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,160
is called the F-18 Growler.

350
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,880
(LAUGHTER)

351
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,680
If the US Navy is going
to call its plane a Growler,

352
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,160
they can't really complain

353
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,840
when the pilots go and make

354
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,360
pictures like that
in the sky, can they?

355
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,720
No. And to be clear, if you're American
and you don't know why we're laughing,

356
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,480
it's the same as, erm,
US troops in Iraq laughed

357
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,120
when British soldiers
were being transported around

358
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,640
in what we call
a Snatch Land Rover.

359
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,480
- (LAUGHTER)
- RICHARD: It's the same joke.

360
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,200
"Hey, you're in a Snatch!"

361
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,400
"Yeah, and you're flying around
in a Growler, so shut up."

362
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,240
Anyway, if those two US aircrew
do get fired and are bored,

363
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,280
you are more than welcome to come on
this show anytime. We'd love to see you.

364
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,000
Yes, you are. We like immature
acts of a sexual nature.

365
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,560
- We do, yeah. Yeah.
- (LAUGHTER)

366
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,640
And that's it for Conversation
Street this week.

367
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,720
JAMES: Thank you.

368
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,640
Thank you so much.

369
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,600
Thank you.

370
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,280
Now, there are many unpleasant
aspects to modern motoring,

371
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,880
such as Peugeots, speed
cameras, drive-by shootings.

372
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,360
But by far the worst of them, we think,
is having to stop to fill up with fuel.

373
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,680
No, it is.
It is the worst thing.

374
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,440
It's particularly annoying if the person
at the pump in front of you fills

375
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,280
and then goes inside to do a
weekly shop for a family of seven.

376
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,880
Yes. Now, we did some
scientific research on this,

377
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,600
and we discovered
that the average motorist

378
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,960
spends 36 days of their life
filling up with fuel.

379
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,920
And that got us thinking.

380
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,240
What if you didn't have
to stop for petrol at all?

381
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,000
JAMES: In order to crack this
problem, we've come here...

382
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,160
...to the Grand Tour special
high-intensity test track.

383
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,800
And it's here that we've come
up with our ingenious solution

384
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,760
to ending the misery
of fuel stop fill-ups.

385
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,680
Allow me.

386
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,320
Yes, welcome, everybody,

387
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,160
to the world's first
vehicle-to-vehicle refuelling vehicle.

388
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,280
To create
this incredible machine,

389
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,560
we've taken our inspiration from the
world of air-to-air refuelling.

390
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,000
And it will, quite simply,
make petrol stations obsolete.

391
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,400
Now, the driver
sits up here as normal,

392
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,080
but this is where
the fuel pump attendant -

393
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,840
which in this case is me -
sits with all the controls,

394
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,200
everything you need, for a
spot of car-to-car refuelling.

395
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,000
Absolutely. And we are so
pleased with our creation

396
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,960
that we are going to let the
machine itself do the talking

397
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,880
with a real-world,
world-first, first ever...

398
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,840
- Yeah, we got that.
- ...inaugural demonstration.

399
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,320
OK, so, here I am
on the motorway.

400
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,160
Oh, no. I need petrol.

401
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,600
And I make contact with
James's refuelling vehicle,

402
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,600
probably via an app
or something.

403
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,120
There's always an app.
We'll get a kid to do that.

404
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,000
And there he is now.

405
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,360
Here comes my first customer
now, down the motorway.

406
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,440
I'm going to know it's him
who needs my services.

407
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,440
There'll be an app
or something for that.

408
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,120
I've got a range of fuels:
unleaded, super unleaded, diesel.

409
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,280
Here we go.

410
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,480
Bringing down
the fuel-o-meter arm.

411
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,160
Now, this tells Richard Hammond how
much fuel he's taking on board

412
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,480
and how much it's costing, and just
as importantly it gives him a marker

413
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,440
where to pull up
in relation to the van.

414
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,640
It's all been carefully calculated
using science... and stuff.

415
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,800
JAMES: Pivoting. Pivoting.

416
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,320
Coming in to open filler flap.

417
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,600
(WHIRRING)

418
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,600
Already the heady fumes of
success are filling my nostrils.

419
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,960
Think about it. You're on
your way to that meeting.

420
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,160
You're not stuck in a petrol station queue
- oh, no -because you are a winner.

421
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,120
You are going to make
that meeting.

422
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,480
This is the key to your success.

423
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,160
- (GLASS SHATTERS)
- What?

424
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,480
JAMES: Sorry! Think of it
as a business opportunity.

425
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,240
- Car-to-car window replacement.
- Oh, brilliant!

426
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,080
Hold steady.
Finger extending again.

427
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,360
(WHIRRING)

428
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,360
I've got it.

429
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,720
Oh! Cocking Nora.

430
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,680
Yeah, we're... nearly there.

431
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,200
RICHARD: Having successfully
opened the filler flap,

432
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,600
it was time for phase two:
unscrewing the fuel cap.

433
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,880
(WHIRRING)

434
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,120
Passengers would love this.

435
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,240
Think of the kids. I mean,
they would love watching this.

436
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,200
JAMES: Fuel cap is removed.

437
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,160
Extending fuel nozzle.

438
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,440
(WHIRRING)

439
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,320
I'll be as steady as I can.

440
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,520
Back a little bit.

441
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,200
Yeah, there it is!

442
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,960
- (METALLIC CLUNK)
- We are pumping!

443
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,280
Yeah, we are pumping gas!
Oh, yeah!

444
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,360
It works!

445
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
Oh, shit!

446
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,200
What's happened?

447
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,680
Hammond, right, you're on fire!

448
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,480
- Bail out!
- Oh, no.

449
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,160
James, you bloody idiot!

450
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,920
RICHARD: Clearly, this system
had a couple of issues.

451
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,840
So we reconvened a few days
later with a new solution.

452
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,520
OK, second time lucky.

453
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,800
We think the problem with
the car-to-car refueller

454
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,760
was there was a bit too much
tech, too much to go wrong.

455
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,400
So we've scaled back
on that front.

456
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,960
And there's James now.

457
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,560
- Red light, on.
- (BUZZER)

458
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,080
Activating door release.

459
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,280
(BEEP)

460
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,840
Now, what we're using here is
Chinese acrobats from the circus.

461
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,320
Circuses get a lot of downtime,
so that's a win-win all around.

462
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,240
They are going to refuel
Hammond's car.

463
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,440
- Watch this. Green light.
- (BUZZER)

464
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,080
He's on.

465
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,680
I'm not stopped.
I just carry on.

466
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,480
Look at that. It's like being
refuelled by Spider-Man.

467
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,560
The genius of this is we've made
the petrol pump attendant mobile,

468
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,040
rather than
the petrol pump itself.

469
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,280
It's much cheaper, it's safer.

470
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,480
Right, that chap's pretty
much exhausted his supply.

471
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,720
- Time to send the second man.
- (BUZZER)

472
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,760
- OK, Hammond, pull up for acrobat number two, please.
- (OVER RADIO) Right-o.

473
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,800
Oh...

474
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,560
RICHARD: Clearly, there were
also some flaws in this method.

475
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,120
So we went back to the drawing
board, and a few days later...

476
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,680
OK, we have had
a total grass-roots rethink.

477
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,520
And, well, fingers crossed
for third time lucky.

478
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,160
Check this out, viewers!

479
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,240
What this is is one of those
specialist airport vehicles

480
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,280
that normally goes around doing,
you know, airporty-type stuff.

481
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,440
But it also, as you can see, makes a perfect
platform for a mobile fuel station.

482
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,720
This really is genius.
This time.

483
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,360
Here we go.

484
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,120
Oh, yeah. Ramp's going down.

485
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,000
Ready to commence docking.

486
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,600
Right. I've never done this. I don't know
if it's going to work. I'm hoping it does.

487
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,720
(CLANGING)

488
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,840
I'm on!
I haven't been killed!

489
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,680
There you go. You see,
no exploding acrobats,

490
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,680
no cars having to keep
perfect station or anything.

491
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,560
Hammond can refuel at leisure.

492
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,360
He can even have
a cup of coffee.

493
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,680
So, that's it. My car is refuelled
and I haven't stopped my journey.

494
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,680
I'm still on my way.

495
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,000
(OVER LOUDSPEAKER) Thank you
for using Fuel Port.

496
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,880
Please continue
to enjoy your journey.

497
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,480
(RICHARD SIGHS)

498
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,360
Ready for disembarkation.
Now, this is a bit tricky.

499
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,040
This is precision stuff.

500
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,960
Oh, God.

501
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,040
It's a good job Hammond's not the
sort of person who has accidents.

502
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,320
OK, here I go.

503
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,400
And we're off! (LAUGHS)

504
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,880
It only works!

505
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,880
Yes!

506
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,640
(LAUGHS)

507
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,440
We did something,
and we did it well!

508
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,360
Motorists of the world,
you may have your lives back.

509
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,920
(CHEERING)

510
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,240
- Very, very impressed.
- (APPLAUSE CONTINUES)

511
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,120
RICHARD: Yep, saved the world.

512
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,360
Oh, yeah.

513
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,280
- Credit where it's due.
- It worked.

514
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,720
And I have to say,
what staggers me

515
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,880
is that
even without me helping -

516
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,080
because I was in hospital
at the time -

517
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,840
you managed to get
something that worked.

518
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,880
No, it worked because
you were in hospital.

519
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,560
- RICHARD: It's connected, yeah.
- Whatever.

520
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,360
You've gifted everybody here
another 36 days of life,

521
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,800
and not even the Baby Jesus
could manage that.

522
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,280
So well done, you.

523
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,680
But we did
kill a Chinese man. Sorry.

524
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,440
Yes, and I think we should take a
moment now to remember his sacrifice.

525
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,120
(LAUGHTER)

526
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,280
(LAUGHTER)

527
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,200
- Hammond, if you killed a man, you can't be impatient.
- I'm sorry! I-I did it.

528
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,800
- We'll gloss over it.
- It was a short sacrifice, wasn't it?

529
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,120
Anyway, listen, it's time now
for Celebrity Face Off!

530
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,160
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

531
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,640
Once again,
we are asking a big question.

532
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,520
And it's this:

533
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,480
who is the fastest person
in the world

534
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,640
who earns a living from punching
and strangling other men?

535
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,200
- (LAUGHTER)
- To help us find out,

536
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,640
please welcome Anthony Joshua
and Bill Goldberg!

537
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,520
(CHEERING)

538
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,960
Bloody hell.

539
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,920
They're getting nearer!

540
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,000
- How the hell are you?
- I'm well. You?

541
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,120
- Very well. How are you?
- How are you, sir?

542
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,520
I'm very well. Do...

543
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,320
It's the land of the giants!

544
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,200
(CHEERING)

545
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,600
- Ah, look at that!
- JEREMY: You can feel the oestrogen, can't you?

546
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,800
This...
It's like Loose Women.

547
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,800
- (LAUGHTER)
- What?

548
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,800
And for the first time in my life
I actually feel like a midget.

549
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,760
- (LAUGHTER)
- Yeah.

550
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,360
No, I mean, this guy, he's...
Well, you're... But he's...

551
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,440
- Massive. He's a unit.
- How tall are you?

552
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,560
- "A unit"! Thank you.
- He's a unit.

553
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,200
Yeah, he is,
but you're, what, six...

554
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,120
Six-six.

555
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,000
Yeah, I think that's just
ridiculous, personally. Erm...

556
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,600
See, I've been hit in the head
with chairs too many times.

557
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,880
I used to be 6'6".
I'm only 6'3" now.

558
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,680
The make-up girl was saying she's never
seen a head with more scars on it.

559
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,440
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- (LAUGHTER)

560
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
I'm slightly out of my
comfort zone here, chaps,

561
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,840
because boxing
and wrestling are not...

562
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,480
I'm not really an expert
in either,

563
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,600
so I hope you can guide me
through some of the things.

564
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,560
- Er... You're obviously the boxist. We do know that.
- (LAUGHTER)

565
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,560
One thing that really interests
me is you get hit, obviously.

566
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,960
- Yeah, yeah.
- How much does it hurt?

567
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,280
Do you know what it is, what I've learned?
I was thinking about this the other day.

568
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,840
It's like, you know, as an
athlete you can look amazing,

569
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,040
be in the best shape, you can
be the tallest, the strongest.

570
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,240
But it's when you start getting hit you
question, "Do I really want to do this?"

571
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,760
You've fought on with a broken
nose, though, haven't you?

572
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,800
Yeah, my last fight.
My last fight, strong guy.

573
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,920
Erm... But it wasn't planned.
It's never happened before.

574
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,920
- You know?
- Well, I do.

575
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,560
- Not what he does!
- Yeah.

576
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,920
- "Can you break my nose in the second round?"
- (LAUGHTER)

577
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,200
I thought the ref was going to give me five
minutes to get myself together, but no.

578
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,560
"You all right?" "Yeah."
"Carry on." And that was it.

579
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,520
And if I don't carry on, then
I lose my titles and so on.

580
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,280
You went on and won the fight
with a broken nose? Yeah.

581
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,880
- Just say yes.
- Yes, I won. I battered him.

582
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,560
(LAUGHTER AND CHEERING)

583
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,240
- (BILL ROARS)
- (ANTHONY LAUGHS)

584
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,680
JEREMY: Now, Bill...

585
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,120
We had wrestling here - and anyone in the
audience who's my age will remember it -

586
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,520
and it was largely a sort of
fat woman called Shirley

587
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,720
would sit on another man's face, and the old
women would jump up and down and shout.

588
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,880
- Hasn't changed a bit.
- (LAUGHTER)

589
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,480
Is it pre-planned?

590
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,400
- It's predetermined. Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
- (GASPS)

591
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,640
- Well, I said that on. Hey...
- (AUDIENCE BOOING)

592
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,000
Hey, I said that on...

593
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,160
I said that on Leno
20 years ago.

594
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,160
ANTHONY: OK, OK. (LAUGHS)

595
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,800
But, you know, I like to tell
people it's predetermined, OK.

596
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,480
You know who's going to win, who's going to
lose, how long the match is supposed to be.

597
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,400
But when I wrestled
The Giant, the Big Show...

598
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,000
- Wow.
- ...he weighed 525lb.

599
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,160
And when I picked him
upside down,

600
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,120
it didn't mean, since it was
predetermined, that he was any lighter.

601
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,240
- (LAUGHTER)
- ANTHONY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

602
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,640
It didn't mean when he picked me
up and threw me through the ground

603
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,000
that it was going to be softer.

604
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,920
You know? You know it's going to happen,
but it doesn't decrease the pain.

605
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,120
So you can strangle people,
can't you?

606
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,720
- You can do anything you like in wrestling.
- Yeah, that's the best part.

607
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,440
I can actually do that in public,
too, and get away with it.

608
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,560
- Now I'm like... (LAUGHS)
- Not with you. You're my...

609
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,680
You can only hit and bite.

610
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,760
No, I can't bite. Because
Tyson bit, I can't bite.

611
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,200
Tyson bit. He was a bitey person.
The Luis Suárez.

612
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,560
He was an exception - in a
league of his own, Mike Tyson.

613
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,880
- BILL: He was an animal.
- He was an animal.

614
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,080
Now, one of the things that fascinates me
about both your disciplines of fighting

615
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,040
is the amount you eat - the calories
you have to bung in every day.

616
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,720
When I got
the phone call last year

617
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,480
to go back to wrestling for
the first time in 12 years,

618
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,200
I had to cover
a lot of ground very quickly.

619
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,360
So I had to eat
as much as humanly possible,

620
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,680
um, and I had to train as
much as humanly possible.

621
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,000
I'd eat 15,000-20,000 calories a day
and I'd train three times a day.

622
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,760
- Fifteen? I mean, that...
- Seriously, that's a lot.

623
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,840
- Do you eat that much?
- I can't compete with that. That's amazing.

624
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,600
- That's dedication in itself.
- We got a request from the girls in the office

625
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,520
for photographs of you without
clothes on, basically - there.

626
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,960
(LAUGHTER)

627
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,240
I eat a lot,
but I don't look like that.

628
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,800
(LAUGHTER)

629
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,720
I was explaining to the girls
in the office, though,

630
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,400
that you've both got penises
like button mushrooms, so...

631
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,880
(LAUGHTER)

632
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,120
- How'd he know?
- (LAUGHTER)

633
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,120
I just... Really.

634
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,840
Can we talk about cars?
This being a car show.

635
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,720
- Yes.
- Please.

636
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,720
Now you both started
with General Motors.

637
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,080
You - I think we've got a picture
of it - with a Pontiac Trans Am.

638
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,760
- ANTHONY: Is that what you started with?
- That's what he started with.

639
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,880
And you started with a General Motors
car, which was a Vauxhall Astra.

640
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,080
(LAUGHTER)

641
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,720
- Nice!
- Do you like it?

642
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,280
It's almost like
if somebody said,

643
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,160
"What's the difference, then, between America
and Britain? You speak the same language."

644
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,640
- Well, there it is: the Astra and the Trans Am.
- ANTHONY: There it is.

645
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,560
Er... And you both
modified cars.

646
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,040
- To a certain degree.
- To a certain degree.

647
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,880
To an extreme degree.

648
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,960
One of yours, you put an
800-horsepower NASCAR motor in.

649
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,600
Anthony, you modified your Astra
because you put a DVD player in it.

650
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,120
(LAUGHTER)

651
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,320
- Which is slightly different.
- ANTHONY: Yeah!

652
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,760
- (GROANS) I told you.
- And then after that...

653
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,040
All I can say is if he beats me
on the lap I'm killing myself

654
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,400
by jumping through that window.

655
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,360
Yeah.

656
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,760
After that, you really haven't got
anything in common with cars at all.

657
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,960
I mean, it's just... It's extraordinary.
It really is.

658
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,480
Have either of you ever crashed?

659
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,600
- Have you crashed?
- Oh, yes, absolutely.

660
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,360
- A few times?
- Maybe, yeah.

661
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,320
What's your best crash?

662
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,760
There is an old story about -
since we drove a Jaguar today...

663
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,320
Erm... My brother
is a car collector,

664
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,000
and he had a XK-E
that I just absolutely loved,

665
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,680
but he wouldn't let me drive
the XK-E a lot.

666
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,440
And... back in '85 when
Fort Lauderdale, Florida,

667
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,960
was the place to go
for spring break,

668
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,720
he leaves one night and says, "Whatever you
do, don't take the Jag to Fort Lauderdale."

669
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,120
Well... what do you think
I did, ladies and gentlemen?

670
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,160
Fast forward a little bit, we're
looking for a parking space,

671
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,600
and the buddy in the backseat
proceeds to open the door

672
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,920
to jump out
and find a parking space,

673
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,280
and simultaneously
a motorcyclist came by

674
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,440
and flipped over the door and
bent it backwards, and so...

675
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,240
That serves them right
for being on a motorcycle.

676
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,560
(LAUGHTER)

677
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,440
So, have you ever crashed one?

678
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,200
It's not as crazy as that.
Just me and my cousin.

679
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,040
You know, I went and got my little
DVD player from Wembley Market,

680
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,800
if anyone knows there, you know?

681
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,080
A little £50 DVD player, but it was...
it was life to me.

682
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,760
So we bought the CDs
that you just...

683
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,720
You can watch your little
hip-hop music videos and stuff.

684
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,920
So, we're cruising.

685
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,320
And, mysteriously, someone placed a car
in front of me at a traffic light.

686
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,840
- So er...
- (LAUGHTER)

687
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,200
How did that happen?

688
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,240
I've looked down
for a split second.

689
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,480
- Yeah.
- (LAUGHTER)

690
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,640
Bang! Straight into the back.

691
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,800
Yeah, but the DVD player on the
insurance form wasn't on, was it?

692
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,000
- It wasn't on. That was fine.
- No, it definitely wasn't on.

693
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,320
But we lived to tell the story.

694
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,120
Now, I'm afraid, we're going to park
you, Anthony, just for a second,

695
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,960
because your collection of cars
now, Bill, is simply unbelievable.

696
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,680
- I mean, I've got the list.
- Let me see.

697
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,760
We're not talking about... You know, we're
not talking about Mini Metros here.

698
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,360
(LAUGHTER)

699
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,120
I mean, we start back in '46
with a Willys Jeep,

700
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,600
the Chevy Biscayne,
the Ford Thunderbird,

701
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,000
Dodge 330, the Cobra Replica,

702
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,920
Mercury truck, Plymouth GTX,
Plymouth GTX Convertible,

703
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,600
Dodge Hemi Charger,
Chevy Blazer, GTO,

704
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,880
Pontiac Trans Am
Pro Touring racing car,

705
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,840
Dodge Ram, Cadillac Escalade,

706
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,080
F250, Dodge Challenger
Hellcat, Charger Hellcat.

707
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,960
Why haven't you got any European
cars, which are vastly superior?

708
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,160
- I do. There's a Porsche 911 Turbo.
- Yes, there is, you're right.

709
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,320
'92 Turbo. I've had
a couple of Ferraris.

710
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,440
So you've got a Volkswagen Beetle
and no other European cars?

711
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,480
Bill, I think you're just being racist,
frankly, with your choice of cars here,

712
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,720
because
this is just so American.

713
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,680
Right, we're going
to talk about your laps.

714
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,840
- How was it out there?
- It's not easy. It was fun, though.

715
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,440
You say it's not easy. Would anyone like to
see a clip of Anthony finding it not easy?

716
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,080
AUDIENCE: Yes.

717
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,760
OK, this is the last corner.
It's a 90-right, OK?

718
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,064
- And here comes Anthony...
- Oh, great,

719
00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:10,464
- ...not making it look easy.

720
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,480
(TYRES SQUEAL)

721
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,360
(ANTHONY LAUGHS)

722
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,440
JEREMY: That is a wide line
through there, Anthony.

723
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,240
So you saw what I did and
tried to copy me, right? Ah!

724
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,960
- (ANTHONY LAUGHS)
- Well, it's funny you should say that.

725
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,040
Because you know they say everything
is bigger and more impressive

726
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,920
when it's American
than if it's British?

727
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,480
- Would you like...
- Play the clip!

728
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,520
- JEREMY: Exactly.
- (LAUGHTER)

729
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,320
JEREMY: That is some
serious speed. (LAUGHS)

730
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,480
Oh, no!

731
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,360
- Yes!
- (CHEERING)

732
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,000
JEREMY: That is, erm...

733
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,560
- If you're going to screw up, screw up big time.
- (LAUGHTER)

734
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,520
It's interesting that
both of you went off on that.

735
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,680
Nobody's had trouble with
that corner before.

736
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,080
- Nobody's had trouble? I don't believe you.
- No. Then both of you.

737
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,120
It's that, "I'm going to..."

738
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,320
Yeah, it was the last corner to
make up time for all our screw-ups.

739
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,760
I'm trying to work out whose lap we're going
to see first. Let's start off with...

740
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,880
- Let's see Bill's. Let's have a look at Bill's lap.
- BILL: Eurgh!

741
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,600
Anthony Joshua,
you're next, mother-(BLEEP).

742
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,960
(LAUGHTER)

743
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,760
(YELLS)

744
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,840
JEREMY: And there he goes!
He is underway.

745
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,040
Looking good. Oh,
cutting the corner nicely.

746
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,640
Now, you should slow
through here a little bit.

747
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,640
BILL: First time I've ever been on the right-hand side.
JEREMY: The correct side.

748
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,160
And now, as we go onto the gravel,
starts to get very loose here.

749
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,720
BILL: First time I've ever been on the gravel, also.
JEREMY: Yeah. Yeah.

750
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,920
That's actually
very tightly done.

751
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,680
I drive like a (BLEEP)
old lady around here.

752
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,840
(LAUGHTER)

753
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,800
JEREMY: Oh, actually, that is not
particularly quick through there.

754
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,520
I was told you were
very fast on the Tarmac,

755
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,600
but not brilliantly quick
on the gravel.

756
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,520
- Well, I could have told you that!
- (LAUGHTER)

757
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,200
JEREMY: Now it gets really slippery
when you rejoin the Tarmac.

758
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,520
That is an amazing line
through there.

759
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,960
- It's actually probably quite sensible.
- BILL: Amazingly good or bad?

760
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,600
JEREMY: No, that's a good idea, because
you get more speed into that corner.

761
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,320
Now we're on the straight.

762
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,600
Let's see if I've got
some balls and stay in this.

763
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,760
JEREMY: Oh, that's quick.
Are we quick...

764
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,000
That does look flat
through there.

765
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,360
And now coming up to the tricky last
corner. Well, tricky for you two.

766
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,160
And... Yeah, there he is. And
across the line, everybody!

767
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,240
- They were nice moves.
- (CHEERING)

768
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,640
Nice moves.

769
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,160
- Who'd like to see Anthony's lap?
- (CHEERING)

770
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,560
Let's have a look.

771
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,400
BILL: Was there any ice out there?
JEREMY: Like that sound.

772
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,920
Come on! Give me some power.

773
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,920
JEREMY: They've all been dry pretty
much so far. You see, that's...

774
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,920
ANTHONY: It looks nice and smooth round there.
JEREMY: With you driving.

775
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,120
ANTHONY: (LAUGHS) You're
going fast round there.

776
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,320
JEREMY: Right, now, we're about
to head onto the gravel.

777
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,760
Now, you see, you pick up
speed here all of a sudden,

778
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,840
for no reason
that anyone can understand.

779
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,080
Exuberant through there.

780
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,080
Oh! No, don't do this! Yes!

781
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,640
(LAUGHTER)

782
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,800
JEREMY: You look like you're enjoying yourself.
BILL: That's what matters!

783
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,320
JEREMY: Yeah, and he's enjoying
himself through there as well.

784
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,800
Kicking the tail out
to go into Difficult Bit Two.

785
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,400
And again! God,
this is impressive stuff.

786
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,200
Car's looking very tidy,
got to be honest.

787
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,680
And now...

788
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,280
Yep.

789
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,720
Tighter line. No,
a tighter line through there.

790
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,000
Now on the left, and then
we're back on the straight.

791
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,640
And it's supposed to be flat all
the way to the last corner.

792
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,320
Now let's go!

793
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,800
JEREMY: Looking quick.
Looking very... Oh, my God!

794
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,600
That was leaning on it.
That was leaning on it there.

795
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,480
And now we're coming up
to the last corner.

796
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,280
Yes. And there we are,
everyone. He's made it, too.

797
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,760
(CHEERING)

798
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,560
That's brilliant.

799
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,160
Right, I have the times.

800
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,560
(BILL CHUCKLES)

801
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,400
- Act like you don't care.
- (LAUGHTER)

802
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,760
- I'm in anticipation.
- Bill Goldberg...

803
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,600
One...

804
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,640
...twenty...

805
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,840
...point-four.

806
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,520
So that's... Yeah. No, that's
worthy of a round of applause.

807
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,760
- It's not the fastest we've ever seen.
- ANTHONY: One minute, 20.4?

808
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,040
One minute, 20.4.

809
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,080
Good. Good time.
That's a good time.

810
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,480
Good thing about you two
is you're not competitive.

811
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,280
(LAUGHTER)

812
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,720
Anthony Joshua: One...

813
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,480
...eighteen-point-seven.

814
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,520
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

815
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,880
BILL: Good time, yeah!

816
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,840
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

817
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,160
Ladies and gentlemen, Bill Goldberg and-
I better read this out-

818
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,520
the world's fastest person
who makes a living

819
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,600
by punching or strangling
other men, Anthony Joshua!

820
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,360
(CHEERING)

821
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,040
BILL: Way to go, man!
ANTHONY: Thank you.

822
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:52,000
Way to go.

823
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,160
Right, now, over the years there
have been many titanic battles

824
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,600
in the world of motorsport -
many great duels.

825
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,400
You've had Hunt versus Lauda,

826
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,080
you've had Prost versus Senna,

827
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,640
you've had the Ford GT40 versus
the Ferraris at Le Mans.

828
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,400
But my favourite battle
of them all is this one.

829
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,560
(WHIRRING)

830
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,760
JEREMY: Back in 1977...

831
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,880
Audi was developing this four-wheel-drive
vehicle for the German military,

832
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,920
when they had
a bit of a thought.

833
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,200
They wondered if its
four-wheel-drive system

834
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,840
could be made to work
in an ordinary family car.

835
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:47,440
And so, under the cover of darkness at a
quarry in a remote corner of Germany,

836
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,640
they began secret tests.

837
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,240
And straight away it was obvious that
with all four wheels being driven,

838
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,480
the family car had an
enormous amount of grip.

839
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:06,000
This meant it could go around corners on
loose surfaces like that much faster.

840
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,200
And that, they reckoned,

841
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,600
would make it good at rallying.

842
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,920
But there was a problem.

843
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,520
What I've got here is the
1979 Motor Racing Rule Book.

844
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,360
It's the most boring book
in the world, but whatever.

845
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,160
Here on page eight million,

846
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,080
article two says
that in rallying

847
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:34,120
"Four-wheel-drive cars...
will not be admitted."

848
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,680
Audi, however,
had thought about that,

849
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,880
and dispatched a man to Paris to a
meeting of the sport's governing body

850
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,680
to try and get the rule changed.

851
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,920
He was very clever,

852
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,520
because he waited for
the meeting to be finished -

853
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,680
everyone pulling on
their hats and coats -

854
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,720
and then he went, "Oh, God.
Sorry, one more thing. Erm...

855
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,280
This rule about, erm, four-wheel-drive
being banned in rallying,

856
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,960
is it OK if we, er...
we get rid of that?"

857
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,080
And everyone said, "Well,
obviously he wants to enter

858
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,360
his silly little army lorry
in something or other,"

859
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,440
so they all went, "Yes, yes.
Whatever," and went home.

860
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,280
Three years later,
this is what happened.

861
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,800
(MAN YELLS)

862
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,400
COMMENTATOR: The four-wheel-drive
Quattro is all-conquering,

863
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,720
and the Audi has been proved
master of all conditions.

864
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,480
Superior power and traction

865
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,800
with the turbo-charged,
four-wheel-drive Audi is too much.

866
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,640
Bjorn Waldegard
has wasted no time

867
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,760
in proving the dominance of
the four-wheel-drive Quattro.

868
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,000
Hannu Mikkola has scored
a tremendous victory.

869
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,160
(APPLAUSE)

870
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:44,000
COMMENTATOR: The Quattros hold all
the aces: first, second and third.

871
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,880
Audi won the World Championship in
1982 with this very car, actually.

872
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,040
And from that moment on,

873
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:55,160
everyone knew that to win in rallying
you had to have four-wheel-drive.

874
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,480
Well, when I say everyone...

875
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,320
This was Lancia's answer
to the Quattro:

876
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,360
the two-wheel-drive 037.

877
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,600
I've got a bit of a soft spot
for all old Lancias,

878
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,960
but in this... it's not soft.

879
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,840
(REVVING)

880
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,520
This is everything
I was expecting it to be.

881
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,040
- (BANG)
- Pops, bangs, lumpy petrol.

882
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,920
A dashboard dominated by this
enormous and very well used ashtray.

883
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,440
Completely Italian. (LAUGHS)

884
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:06,520
Honestly, it is dainty as a dandelion
seed caught in a summer breeze...

885
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,320
(TYRES SCREECH)

886
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,160
...and as agile as a water boatman.
I mean, that was...

887
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,920
(LAUGHS) That was just
glorious through there.

888
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,120
Glorious!

889
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,560
It feels highly strung.
Feels like a thoroughbred.

890
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,840
It's fast as well.

891
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,360
(TYRES SCREECH)

892
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,120
Oh, wow!
What a thing this is.

893
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,240
On a dry track, then,
or in a beauty contest,

894
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,840
the 037 would thrash the
Quattro any day of the week.

895
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,320
But in the rough-and-tumble,

896
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:50,280
crash-bang-wallop world
of rallying, not a chance.

897
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:55,280
What's more, Audi was backed by the
industrial might of Volkswagen.

898
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,800
It was efficient and organised.

899
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,320
This was the team boss,
Roland Gumpert.

900
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:06,000
Look at him! A hands-on, bearded
German doctor of engineering.

901
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,440
Lancia's team boss, meanwhile,
well, he was a bit different.

902
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,640
His name was Cesare Fiorio,

903
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,800
and he liked girls
and power-boat racing.

904
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,360
Also, he was running
a team staffed by Italians,

905
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,080
on a shoestring.

906
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,800
And then there were the drivers.

907
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:34,520
Audi had Hannu Mikkola, and Stig
Blomqvist, and Michèle Mouton...

908
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,520
(SPEAKS IN FRENCH)

909
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,640
...who had won 21 rallies
between them.

910
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,720
Quattro was the car
on everybody's lips,

911
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,240
you know, in rally business.

912
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,840
And, of course, we were
developing the car all the time.

913
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,200
It was getting better
and better.

914
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,240
We were well funded, you know?

915
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,640
And er, that time
it was a big team.

916
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,280
JEREMY: Lancia, meanwhile, had
Markku Alén and Walter Rohrl,

917
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,440
who was brilliant, but said he didn't
want to compete in every event,

918
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,920
and didn't want to be
world champion.

919
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:15,800
I told them, "Listen,
I want to win Monte Carlo."

920
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,600
I like Corsica,
I like Acropolis,

921
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,240
I like New Zealand,
I like er, San Remo.

922
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,440
I only do these five or six beautiful
rallies, and nothing more.

923
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,680
I am not interested to win any
more the World Championship title.

924
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,880
I want to be a normal man,
not something special.

925
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,280
And if we are always in the
newspaper and everywhere,

926
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,600
of course you're never...
you're never alone,

927
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,120
because people standing in front of
your house, and... and I don't like.

928
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:52,160
So, Audi had four-wheel-drive,
a proven car,

929
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,840
a team staffed by Germans,
a hands-on boss,

930
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:01,280
and a squad of world-class drivers
who were motivated and on it.

931
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,080
Lancia, meanwhile,
had a budget of £3.75,

932
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,440
two-wheel-drive, a power-boating
playboy at their helm,

933
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,840
and a part-time driver who didn't
want to be world champion.

934
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,200
However, Lancia did have

935
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,640
one ace up its sleeve.

936
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,760
They'd been
in rallying for ages.

937
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,040
They'd won the championship
four times,

938
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,720
with cars like the Fulvia

939
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,960
and then the Stratos.

940
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,840
So although their
power-boating team boss

941
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,720
looked like a playboy,

942
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,360
he knew all the tricks.

943
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,440
For example, the rules said that before
you could enter a car in a rally,

944
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,400
you had to build
at least 400 examples

945
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,440
which could be sold
as road cars to customers.

946
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,480
Now, obviously, when officials from
the sport's governing body turn up

947
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:58,200
to check you've done that, they are going
to notice if you've only made 200.

948
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,560
So you say, "Yes, mm.

949
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,800
But, you see,
this car park was full,

950
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:11,800
so the other 200 are in a car
park on the other side of town."

951
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,480
And then you say, "Let's go
and count those now,

952
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:20,760
and on the way, why don't we
stop off for a spot of lunch?"

953
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,040
You then make sure the lunch
goes on for a very long time.

954
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,760
You have a starter,
a main course...

955
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,520
So I turned it into candles for
three days, got it into port.

956
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,600
...pudding, cheese...

957
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,440
Well, when I say "reverse,"
careered backwards.

958
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,720
...mints, more cheese...

959
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,040
Shame to waste the bottle.

960
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,800
And then, afterwards, you
take them to another car park

961
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:48,320
which contains, miraculously,
the other 200 cars.

962
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,160
Then you had
the cars themselves.

963
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,960
The rules say they must
be fitted with roll cages.

964
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,920
But roll cages are heavy,
they'll slow you down.

965
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,160
So why not use something like this instead?
It looks like a roll cage.

966
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,080
It would pass a visual inspection
every day of the week.

967
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:12,000
But, actually, it's made...
from cardboard. Look.

968
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,000
I'm not saying
Lancia actually did that.

969
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,760
But if you examine
these crashed 037s,

970
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,280
you can see they weren't
exactly... strong.

971
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,840
My family and my friends
around me said, "Listen.

972
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,280
Why are you signed for Lancia?
This car is so dangerous.

973
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:41,360
If you see these thin tubes
and these plastic things,

974
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:46,120
if you... if you went off, then it's
maybe the last accident you have."

975
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:51,160
And I answer, "Listen, I am not
planning to have an accident."

976
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,160
JEREMY: However, despite Lancia's
experience and Cesare's cunning,

977
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,560
no-one expected them to do well in the
first round of the 1983 Championship,

978
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:04,640
which was held in the freezing
mountains above Monte Carlo.

979
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:12,640
We were very much afraid about this rally,
because you can find a lot of snow,

980
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,640
ice, er, slippery conditions,

981
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:20,880
where, of course, a mid-engine
car with rear-wheel traction

982
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:24,040
is not the... the best idea.

983
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:28,160
JEREMY: So, whilst Audi prepared for
the event by fettling its cars,

984
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,520
Lancia got ready by going
to the supermarket.

985
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,000
Here they bought all the salt
they could lay their hands on.

986
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,480
They then sprinkled this
on the difficult corners

987
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,480
so that by the time their car
came along the ice was gone.

988
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,080
And they weren't finished there.

989
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:58,000
We have been also pushing local authorities,
taking care of the French roads.

990
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,480
Say, "Oh, there's a lot
of ice on that road.

991
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,240
It's very dangerous for spectators and
for the drivers with all this ice."

992
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,680
"Oh, oh, oh, yes."

993
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,000
(LAUGHS)
And so they went and they...

994
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:12,080
and they cleaned up the... the
roads, and that was fantastic.

995
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,960
(LAUGHS)

996
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,360
JEREMY: They also had another
trick up their sleeve.

997
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,960
After the icy stages were over, the Lancia
stopped in the middle of the stage,

998
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,760
so the winter tyres
could be changed.

999
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,520
Now, there was nothing in the rules
that said you could do this.

1000
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:34,160
But critically... there was
nothing that said you couldn't.

1001
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,480
(TOOLS WHIRRING)

1002
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,080
If you want to compete in motorsport, you
must know the rules you have to face.

1003
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,000
The grey zones of the rules.

1004
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:49,600
And it's always a big fight, but er...
you must try to be a bit clever.

1005
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,400
JEREMY: The result
in Monte Carlo, then,

1006
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,440
was the exact opposite of what
everyone had been expecting.

1007
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,520
COMMENTATOR: Four-wheel-drive and
340 turbo-charged horsepower

1008
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,880
are just not enough.

1009
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,840
It's Audi sadness, Lancia joy.

1010
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:08,200
JEREMY: The two-wheel-drive Lancias, on a
rally famed for its slippery conditions,

1011
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,720
finished first and second.

1012
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,760
For the next event
of the year, in Sweden,

1013
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,840
there wasn't enough salt
in the world

1014
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,040
to get rid of all
the snow and ice.

1015
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,840
So Lancia solved the problem...

1016
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,160
...by simply
not turning up at all.

1017
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:38,760
Audi therefore scored
a one-two here.

1018
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:43,720
And three weeks later they did the
same thing again in Portugal.

1019
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,840
And after more successes
in East Africa,

1020
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,480
it looked like Audi
were running away with it.

1021
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,320
But then the whole circus
moved to Corsica,

1022
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:00,120
where almost all of the stages
are held on dry, smooth Tarmac.

1023
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,320
Everyone expected the nimble
two-wheel-drive Lancias

1024
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,280
to pick up
a load of points here.

1025
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:10,640
But nobody could have predicted how
many they were going to pick up.

1026
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,280
Usually, Lancia turned up at an
event with two or three cars,

1027
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,280
but here they arrived with four.

1028
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,320
Which meant that if they ran
faultlessly, which they did,

1029
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,680
the best Audi
could hope for was fifth.

1030
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,240
And thanks
to mechanical failures...

1031
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,520
they didn't even get that.

1032
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:39,040
With our speed,
it's just like holiday.

1033
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,600
So, Lancia, with its salt
and its tyre-changing antics,

1034
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,520
and its... flexible approach to
how many cars were in the team,

1035
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,520
was back on top
of the leader board.

1036
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,480
But then the whole circus
moved to the roughest

1037
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,480
and toughest event
on the European calendar.

1038
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,400
Greece.

1039
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,800
Here, everyone knew the rough roads
would cause mechanical issues.

1040
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,840
There would be breakdowns,
and there were.

1041
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,440
But amazingly,
they were all Audis.

1042
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,640
COMMENTATOR: For Lancia,
it's an impressive victory.

1043
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,760
Rohrl has again driven superbly.

1044
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,680
And I won Acropolis
in a... in a Lancia.

1045
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,160
Er... It was a result
I never expected,

1046
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,760
that we even
can come to the finish,

1047
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,760
because I was thinking, "Maybe
the Lancia is too light

1048
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,440
to stay in one piece for...
for Greece."

1049
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,440
JEREMY: The year wore on
with both teams

1050
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,360
always in contention
for the championship.

1051
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,880
But then it was time for everyone to
head for the bumpy hell of Finland,

1052
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,800
and Lancia had a problem:

1053
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,160
Walter Rohrl refused to go.

1054
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,920
I didn't like to go to Finland,

1055
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,840
because I...
I don't like jumps.

1056
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:06,760
Because, you know, if I want
to fly, I would be a pilot.

1057
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,120
But not sitting in a car.
That's no way.

1058
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:24,480
JEREMY: Because of his
no-show, Audi won, easily.

1059
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:33,720
However, with only three rounds left,
it was mathematically possible

1060
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,080
for Lancia to win the World
Championship in San Remo.

1061
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,080
And that's something
they really wanted to do,

1062
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,280
because San Remo...
well, that's Italy.

1063
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,960
They'd be winning it
in front of their home crowd.

1064
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,280
To do that, they'd have to deal with the
main feature of the San Remo Rally.

1065
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,920
Dust.

1066
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,120
It's thrown up by a car, and a minute
later when the next one comes along,

1067
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,840
it's still there.

1068
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:06,560
Which makes seeing where
you're going a bit tricky.

1069
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,600
To try and make
everything better,

1070
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,760
they fitted a team van with brushes
and sent it up the course.

1071
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,280
But this didn't really work,

1072
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,880
so the drivers came up
with a cunning alternative.

1073
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,480
(REVVING)

1074
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,600
On one stage, a minute after
the German car had set off

1075
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,400
and the Lancia
was supposed to go...

1076
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,880
it didn't move.

1077
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,720
So the starter went over
to see what was wrong.

1078
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,520
I'm really sorry.
My belt, it's...

1079
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,760
I don't know how it's
happened. It's come undone.

1080
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,240
I know I should... I should have done
this before we came to the start line.

1081
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,280
It's my bad, really. Oh,
now they've all come undone!

1082
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,880
I feel like such an idiot.
I just need to...

1083
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:53,520
By the time the problem had been solved,
the dust, luckily, had all gone.

1084
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,920
Right, we're good to go now.

1085
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:00,640
Oh, no! The door!
Oh, there it is.

1086
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:04,480
Annoyingly, the officials quickly
put a stop to this Boss Hoggery.

1087
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,760
So if Lancia was going
to win here on gravel,

1088
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:14,000
it would all be down
to the skill of the driver.

1089
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:19,120
And, boy, did Walter Rohrl
rise to the occasion.

1090
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,880
Looking back in my career, it was maybe
my best rally in my life I have done.

1091
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,320
It was just like...
like a dream.

1092
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,320
I mean, I was just thinking,

1093
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,720
"I want to...
to cut this corner.

1094
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,120
Don't lose 10cm of road."

1095
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,240
The car was going
exactly on this point,

1096
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,200
and it was flowing.

1097
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,680
It was just...

1098
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,000
"Nobody can beat me."

1099
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:50,880
And then there was
the magnificent 037 itself.

1100
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:54,320
ROHRL: Driving a Lancia,
it's a perfect thing,

1101
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:58,120
because it... it doing
exactly what you want.

1102
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,280
It's like my...
like my... my shoe.

1103
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,680
It fits so perfectly.

1104
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,320
If I just think it should
do this one, it has done it.

1105
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,600
(CHUCKLES)

1106
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,760
JEREMY: With man and machine
in such perfect harmony,

1107
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:18,920
Rohrl won a staggering
33 of the 58 stages.

1108
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,480
The team scored a
one-two-three, and as a result,

1109
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,240
they won the World Championship.

1110
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:31,040
David had beaten
the four-wheel-drive Goliath.

1111
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,920
And no two-wheel-drive car...
would ever do that again.

1112

(CHEERING DROWNS OUT SPEECH)

1113
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,480
Yeah, I do, definitely.
I want one.

1114
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,440
Great story.
A really good story.

1115
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,880
Yeah, it is. What?

1116
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,840
I'm just wondering,
though. Did...

1117
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:09,520
Did a Lancia driver win the Drivers'
World Championship that year?

1118
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,200
- No, because Walter Rohrl didn't want to.
- No, the other bloke.

1119
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,360
Markku Alén? Mathematically, he could
have won the Drivers' Championship.

1120
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:19,960
But after they won the Constructors'
Championship in San Remo there,

1121
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,800
Lancia then, they didn't bother
going to the last two events.

1122
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,040
They just didn't go,
so he couldn't win.

1123
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,960
That must be pretty frustrating if
you're a professional racing driver.

1124
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,480
It would be the same as
Mercedes' Formula 1 Team

1125
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,960
winning the Constructors'
Championship last year in Texas,

1126
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,040
then saying, "We're not going
to go to the last three races.

1127
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,360
Got Lewis Hamilton going,
"But I can't..."

1128
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,040
"I'm sorry, we've won, and that's
all we're bothered about."

1129
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,240
- But I tell you what makes me sad...
- JEREMY: Mm.

1130
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,160
...is the way that Lancia has
pretty much vanished these days.

1131
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,560
Oh, I know. Audi is now enormous,
and Lancia's shrivelled up

1132
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:51,200
to the point where it only makes one
pretty terrible car, if we're honest,

1133
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,240
and it only sells it in Italy.

1134
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,560
It is, it's heartbreaking. And
on that terrible disappointment-

1135
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,400
and for once it really is a terrible
disappointment - it's time to end.

1136
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,320
Thank you so much
for watching. Goodbye.
