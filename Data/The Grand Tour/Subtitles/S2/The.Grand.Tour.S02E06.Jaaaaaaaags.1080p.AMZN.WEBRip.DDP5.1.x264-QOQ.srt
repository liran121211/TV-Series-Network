1
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,120
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello!

2
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,040
Thank you.

3
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,000
- Greetings, everybody.
- Wow!

4
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,360
- We got a rowdy bunch in!
- They are, they are.

5
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,920
Thank you so much.
Thank you, everybody.

6
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,640
Thank you and welcome.

7
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,160
And, in this edition
of our car show...

8
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,840
Richard steals some sun cream...

9
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,240
I drink some wine...

10
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,760
...and James says "40."

11
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,880
40?

12
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,400
All that...
All that is to come.

13
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,240
But, we begin with Jaguar.

14
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,600
Now, us three, we love Jags because
they're so... they're so roguish.

15
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,240
You can take a girl for dinner if you
have a Jag, and then she will pay.

16
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,280
You could go and stay
with people for the weekend,

17
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,280
help yourself to
all their belongings

18
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,640
and no one will mind because
"you have a Jag". Exactly!

19
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,200
In fact, people expect it.

20
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,200
You have somebody to stay
at your house who owns a Jag,

21
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,920
you've got to accept you're
gonna lose some paintings.

22
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,120
And some cutlery.

23
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,440
The thing is, though, OK,
even though a Jaguar

24
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,560
is an international
get-out-of-jail-free card,

25
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,160
very few people
actually ever buy one.

26
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,960
Who here has got a Jag?
One, two...

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,920
Only three people in Britain
drive Jaguars.

28
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,160
It's astonishing.

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah, I've actually got the sales figures
here and they are pretty tragic,

30
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,320
because in the five years
up to 2016,

31
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,680
Jaguar sold
200,000 cars worldwide.

32
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,760
And in the same period,
Audi, Mercedes and even BMW,

33
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,600
each sold over eight million.

34
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,760
It's a staggering statistic,
it really is.

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,280
We were talking about this in the office
the other day and Mr Wilman said,

36
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,560
people don't buy Jags because
they used to break down.

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,280
Yeah, but, that's just not true.

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,840
And we decided to prove this

39
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,880
by taking The Grand Tour
this week to Colorado.

40
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,000
The car I've chosen is, I think,
the best car Jaguar ever made.

41
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,280
The V8 super-charged XJR.

42
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,040
It's cool without being
Cool Britannia.

43
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,760
It's caddish
without being laddish.

44
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,680
It's... violent
without being vicious.

45
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,240
And it is just the last word
in sophistication.

46
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,680
Hannibal Lecter had one
and that says it all because

47
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,560
the last we saw of him
he was on a plane, scot-free,

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,000
eating
a district attorney's head.

49
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,720
Soon I reached the meeting
point, where I found James,

50
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,920
who'd bought an XK8 convertible.

51
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,160
Here we are, look.
A big cat near an old dog.

52
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,160
- Greetings, May.
- Moron.

53
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,280
It's not a Subaru!

54
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,440
You're supposed to be upholding
the reputation of the Jag driver.

55
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,680
- Why have you bought that?
- Because it's excellent.

56
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,120
- It isn't.
- It is.

57
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,360
- This was a very poor Jaguar.
- This was a very good Jaguar.

58
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,360
You could go camping in the wheel
arches of it! They're so high up.

59
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,200
They looked all right when they were
super-charged and lower but this is...

60
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,840
They didn't work properly when
they were super-charged and lower

61
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,560
because they had
a terrible ride.

62
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,040
The one thing you get
from a Jag is a nice ride.

63
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,040
You're disconnected from the
world, that's the point. Anyway...

64
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,000
And those wheels!
There's no "anyway" about it.

65
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,320
That's the best Jag
probably ever made.

66
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,320
- Hmm. No.
- Well, it is.

67
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,480
Tell me what's wrong with that?

68
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,680
One of the wheels is odd.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,840
Yes, ah, I know exactly
what's happened here.

70
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,120
Previous owner's had a puncture.

71
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,880
He's simply borrowed a wheel
from another car to use.

72
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,360
- And he's gonna give it back?
- Of course he is.

73
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,120
- Because he drives a Jag.
- Exactly.

74
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,440
And look in here!

75
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,760
It looks as if there's been
a knife fight in the car.

76
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,200
That's because he went to stay
with some friends, obviously,

77
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,520
thought,
"I'll borrow their cutlery"

78
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,720
tucked it into his trousers and then he's
cut his seats, that's what's happened.

79
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,800
At this point,
Mr Hammond hoved into view.

80
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,120
- God, is that a Mark X?
- That is a Mark X.

81
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,480
That's a properly
villainous Jag.

82
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,440
- That that is a proper Jag.
- Yeah.

83
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,600
Whatever you do, OK,
do not tell him that.

84
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,920
No, no.

85
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
- Hammond, you idiot.
- What?

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,160
We're supposed to be upholding
the reputation of Jaguar,

87
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,760
you've brought an antique, you've
brought an old piece of furniture.

88
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,680
I am celebrating and revelling
in the glories of Jaguar.

89
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,200
This is 1967420G.

90
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,960
This front end started with this car.
That's the Jaguar look.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,040
The forehead lamps,
the narrow grill.

92
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,240
Hammond, seriously.
What is that?

93
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,200
It's a 420G.
This was the favour--

94
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,880
- No, no not that. That.
- This? It's my jacket.

95
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,040
I thought, a bit of style.
We're in Jaguars.

96
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,640
There's no style
in the jacket at all.

97
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,920
It's riddled with style!

98
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,280
Some of your jackets
are terrible, but I can't--

99
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,040
Anyway, this was favoured by
every villainous bank robber and baddie

100
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,760
in and around England
in the '60s.

101
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,040
- How much did you pay for it?
- £6,500.

102
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,360
- What?
- That is a lot of car for six-and-a-half grand.

103
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,280
- Look at the size of it!
- Hammond, that is 1,000...

104
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,560
No, wait, £2,500 more

105
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,040
than I paid for
a super-charged Jaguar.

106
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,040
That is Jaguar's embarrassing attempt
to recapture their own design

107
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,400
that started with this, the four
head-lamps, the narrow grill.

108
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,520
This is definitive.
Your car is derivative.

109
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,400
And Hammond
wasn't finished there.

110
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,760
Look at the size of this!

111
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,520
Imagine how many oil paintings,
borrowed, I could get in there.

112
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,840
Smells terrible.

113
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,760
- Tool kit.
- Let me have a look.

114
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,720
- That's for opening windows.
- It is, no this is...

115
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,520
Not necessarily for
fixing the car!

116
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,600
That's for cutting through
somebody's fence.

117
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,520
This is for undoing
the paintings from the walls.

118
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,800
All the Jaguar toolkit
is just for burglaries.

119
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,560
It's got a jemmy in it!

120
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,040
At this point we set off
into the heart of Colorado,

121
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,160
eager to demonstrate
the magnificence of our cars.

122
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,040
Now it is telling me here that
the traction control has failed,

123
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,320
the stability control has failed, and
that the anti-lock brakes have failed.

124
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,560
And that's brilliant, because Jaguar
obviously realised when they made this car

125
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,240
that drifting would one day
become very popular,

126
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,520
and driver aids like this would
be unwelcome and unnecessary.

127
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,240
So they were designed
to break, and they have done.

128
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,600
This particular 420G is from 1967.
Quite well-equipped.

129
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,440
This row of toggle switches
here on the dash, six of them.

130
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,640
Wiper. Look at that!

131
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,800
Look at... Oh.

132
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,400
Yeah!
That's the wipers there.

133
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,960
And then this is...
They won't turn off now.

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,200
This is the fan. That doesn't
do anything at the moment.

135
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,760
These are features.

136
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,440
This is character that has
evolved over the years.

137
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,560
These are the beauty spots,

138
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,080
or the slight squint to one eye
that makes a person beautiful.

139
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,360
If anything... If anything... Oh.
The glove box has come open.

140
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,440
I'll close that now.

141
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,920
It's done it again.

142
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,520
Normally I'd say at this
point, now we're alone, viewers,

143
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,560
let me talk you through a couple of
things that aren't right with my car.

144
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,360
I'm afraid I can't do that because
everything in here works perfectly.

145
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,960
There is, if you look in the left-hand
dial, which is the rev counter,

146
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,560
there's an engine
warning light on

147
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,360
to remind me that the engine warning
light works, and that it's there.

148
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,120
When you brake, like that,

149
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,840
the brake pedal judders for you,
so you know you're braking.

150
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,640
That's brilliant! Why doesn't
everybody do that?

151
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,960
I will give
Hammond's car one thing,

152
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,640
it does give good
rear view mirror.

153
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,080
It looks villainous.

154
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,000
The Kray twins actually had
420s just like Hammond's Jag.

155
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,200
If you're watching this in America and
you don't know who the Krays are,

156
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,280
they're the reason the Mafia
never got to London.

157
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,760
They were too scared
of the Krays.

158
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,720
Some incredibly strong smells
in this car.

159
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,320
There's a sort of
gluey, resiny smell.

160
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,200
And burning.

161
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,680
Yeah, burning.

162
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,120
It's having a smoke!

163
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,760
It's from the '60s.
Everybody smoked in the '60s.

164
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,200
- It would smoke, it's a Jag.
- That's what's it's...

165
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,480
You have a smoke, mate.

166
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,880
It's seen this nice view and thought,
"I'll have a pipe and contemplate it."

167
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,560
Like, like a red native.
What are they called?

168
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,200
- Native American?
- Yes, that.

169
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,240
Once Hammond's car
had finished its smoke,

170
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,880
we resumed our
fuss-free journey,

171
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,240
and I got my foot down.

172
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,520
It's still got tons of poke.
Look at that!

173
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,400
Which went well.

174
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,280
It's just not changing gear.
It's... There's neutral.

175
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,880
Right, now it's in,
I think, second.

176
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,440
Jeremy, why are we
going so slowly?

177
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,760
I'll tell you exactly why, because
the only German part in here,

178
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,840
the Mercedes gearbox,
has gone wrong.

179
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,800
That was a sad lapse of
judgment on Jaguar's part.

180
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,440
Any idiot knows you don't
put German bits in a car.

181
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,120
- Manually changing gear.
- What is wrong with it?

182
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,880
It's selecting a gear for the moment
and then just sticking with it.

183
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,360
I can't wait for it
to choose reverse.

184
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,320
This problem with shoddy German engineering
couldn't have come at a worse time,

185
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,840
because we were
now arriving at the location

186
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,280
for Mr Wilman's first challenge

187
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,600
and I'd have to
fix things sharpish.

188
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,600
Now look.

189
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,480
"Now look" what?

190
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,960
Don't let us distract you
Professor, Doctor.

191
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Listen, I have worked
this out all by my own!

192
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,480
The gearbox has overheated, OK? So
I'm gonna put some fluid in it.

193
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,840
How much do you need to put in?

194
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,160
Don't know. How
much do you need to put in?

195
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,760
- Put enough in. Go on.
- Yeah, put some in.

196
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,440
It's like watching a really, really
old drunk pour himself a Scotch!

197
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,880
"Just enough, man."

198
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,840
The concentration face
is coming out, there it is.

199
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,520
Good to see a man operating
at his absolute limit.

200
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,720
With the problem solved,
it was time to get cracking.

201
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,440
We'd be competing against one
another here at an off-road course,

202
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,640
which Mr Wilman was convinced

203
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,720
would break our ancient
Jaguars into 1,000 pieces.

204
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,360
However, James had worked out
a way to prove him wrong.

205
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,400
OK, are you ready?
In three, two, one, go!

206
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,000
- It's a long car. It takes a long time to go past.
- That's what it is.

207
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,640
I'd better brake for this
left-hander, change down.

208
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,400
Oh, concentrate!

209
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,640
And approaching the jump.

210
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,960
He may get air here.

211
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,720
There you go.

212
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,000
Know this, if you're
turning over now to watch

213
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,480
Man In A High Castle,
something of that nature,

214
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,880
James is gonna
finish this course.

215
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,360
Which, eventually, he did.

216
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,040
- And... across the line.
- There he is.

217
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,680
Yeah.

218
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,320
James May,
you just set a lap record.

219
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,280
Yes!

220
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,600
The fastest ever lap

221
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,840
in a Jaguar XK8
around this track.

222
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,040
As you can see,
the perfect track day car.

223
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:07,760
This Jaguar has done a lap of this very
demanding race circuit, and it's perfect.

224
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,760
Next up was me,
in the tight-fit XJR.

225
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,640
It is quite snug in here.
Look, really.

226
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,720
- There is a problem. If I hit the top of your head...
- Oh, hang on!

227
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,920
That's what that's for!

228
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,400
It's a helmet hatch.
That's what it is.

229
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,560
You'll almost certainly
be killed, though.

230
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,120
You know when they take
the top off a boiled egg?

231
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,280
- You do the countdown.
- In three, two, one, go!

232
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,560
Yeah, there's some dust.

233
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:46,240
And there we are! I have
unleashed 385 horsepower!

234
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:53,120
And I would now demonstrate that this 17-year-old
car had lost none of that horsepower.

235
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,920
Or any of its
razor-sharp handling.

236
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,680
Oh, yeah. Just feel
the tail going nicely.

237
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,280
Oh, bollocks! It didn't.

238
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,640
I have slightly got that wrong,

239
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,200
but we can edit that out and cut
to this, and it looks good.

240
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,400
God, he's all over the place.
Look at that!

241
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,320
What you're watching here
is liquid poetry.

242
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,000
And flick it in!

243
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,840
He's completely messed it up.

244
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,240
Yeah, he's just...
What... What is he doing?

245
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,520
I've had a spin there.
A slight spin has gone.

246
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,160
I'm blind as a bat now.

247
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,560
That's... That's added
to his time quite a lot.

248
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
There we go, speed up again now.

249
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,040
And...

250
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,120
You ready?

251
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,960
...across the line.

252
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,040
1:54.

253
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,920
But the important thing is,

254
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:52,680
that's a lap record for the
XJR, and it's still working.

255
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,160
Finally, it was the turn
of Ronnie and Reggie Hammond.

256
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,800
Here we go.
In three, two, one, go!

257
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,680
Here we go, unleashing
4.2-litre straight-six.

258
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,160
Because Hammond's 50-year-old
Jag was a senior citizen,

259
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,680
we hoped he'd take it easy.

260
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,360
However...

261
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,080
Let's do this properly.
Come on!

262
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680
Oh, his boot's come open.

263
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,200
- He hasn't really got the point of this from the start.
- No. No, he hasn't.

264
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,280
You've got a bit more than that in you.
I know you have!

265
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,040
You've got more to give me.
Give me more!

266
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,480
Oh, no, look!
Tons of black smoke.

267
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,480
Yeah!

268
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,040
Ha-ha-ha! Come on!

269
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,520
Back at the finish line,

270
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,800
my colleagues were
not impressed with me.

271
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,400
There's oil
everywhere, and coolant.

272
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,040
All you had to do was go round
pretending it was a bit dramatic

273
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,520
proving that a Jaguar worked
properly and was durable.

274
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,880
I gave it a bit of the beans in
a corner, bit of a tail-out.

275
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,720
This lot at home are fooled. They
think I was trying my hardest.

276
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,520
I pulled a face.
I went like that.

277
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,120
- What did you do?
- Gave it--

278
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,640
And look at the back
of your car.

279
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,600
Smashed rear window.
Boot lid, no other word, off.

280
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,360
Does it actually start?

281
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,960
- I think you threw a rod.
- It's all fixable.

282
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,760
What was that?
What was that "glang" noise?

283
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,880
It could be a rod going through the
side of the wall. I can fix this.

284
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,760
And sure enough...

285
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,320
I would have bet my left ear that Hammond
would never be able to get that Jag going,

286
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,120
and yet, he has!

287
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,640
Turns out the actual damage was
nowhere near as bad as we thought.

288
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,160
All I had to do,
straighten the boot lid,

289
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,120
top up the water in the radiator,
that did need doing, that was it.

290
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,760
Yep.

291
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Never noticed the sun roof
before. That's good.

292
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,200
So, there we are,

293
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,240
proof you can go off-road
racing with three Jaguars,

294
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,840
and all of them will survive.

295
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,240
Well, it is just good that
we're back as a three,

296
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,240
with the three cars
running well.

297
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,200
I think we got away with that.
They never noticed.

298
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,000
No, nobody.
Yeah, we're good. We're good.

299
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,960
- Anyway, shh, shh, shh.
- Yeah.

300
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,520
I can't believe, I simply cannot
believe, how robust those Jags were.

301
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,160
I can, they are tremendously
well-made cars, they really are.

302
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,480
Swiss watchmakers, they gasp sometimes
when they look at an old Jag and go,

303
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,040
"I cannot believe how much
perfection there is in there."

304
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,760
Exactly, and we will
come back to that later on,

305
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,400
but right now it's time to slide
across an icy puddle of chat

306
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
on Conversation Street.

307
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,200
- That hurt?
- Yeah.

308
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,600
Right now, we begin with this.

309
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,680
You know the fire brigade
these days

310
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,800
have been issued with those big
hydraulic, erm, poultry shears?

311
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,200
You mean the jaws of life?

312
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,040
- Whatever they're called.
- Jaws of life.

313
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,040
If you give a man a tool like that,
he is going to use it all the time.

314
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,000
Which means whenever the fire brigade now
turn up at the most minor car accident,

315
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,040
out they come,
they cut the car's roof off.

316
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,960
- Yeah, they do.
- Are there any firemen here?

317
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,040
No, because they're too busy out there
cutting people's roofs off. They are!

318
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,480
Loads of them out there.
It is getting out of hand.

319
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,560
There was a story recently, somebody had a
pretty much brand-new Range Rover Sport,

320
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,080
it had done 400 miles.

321
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,640
They had a bit of a shunt.
I think we've got a picture.

322
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,200
It's broken a headlamp,
but that's about it.

323
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,200
Fire brigade come along and immediately
cut the roof off, there you go.

324
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,720
I mean, that's made everything worse!

325
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,000
I can beat that, OK? Couple of years ago
there was this woman driving along.

326
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,920
There'd been a minor accident,
she wasn't involved,

327
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,720
but the people who were,
were standing around.

328
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,640
She said, "Do you want to sit
down in the back of my car?"

329
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,880
Fire brigade turn up,
cut the roof off her car.

330
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,000
- What, they...
- There, look!

331
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,240
That hadn't been in the crash?

332
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,600
They'd gone in
through the doors, said,

333
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,840
"We'll cut the roof off,
easier to get you out."

334
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,440
The doors are working, look!

335
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,360
She was being a good
Samaritan and that's what she got?

336
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,120
- Do you know they actually did this to the police?
- Who, the fire brigade?

337
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,280
The police turned up at the scene
of an accident, a very minor one.

338
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,080
The people were unhurt
but it was raining.

339
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,240
They said, "Would you like to rest in the police car?"

340
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,720
No, please tell me...
They didn't!

341
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,320
The fire brigade cut the roof
off the police car!

342
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,480
That's gonna escalate.

343
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,560
I think what happened later on

344
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,400
was the police went in their convertible
police car round to the fire station

345
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,200
and blew up the fire engine in a "controlled
explosion" which is what the police do!

346
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,560
It's gonna build!

347
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,520
I kerbed the wheel on my car
the other day and I thought,

348
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,920
"I hope the fire brigade didn't see me
do that. They'll cut the roof off!"

349
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,920
They wouldn't cut the roof off your
car because that's only a Golf.

350
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,520
- What they like to do is cut the roof off a Porsche!
- That's more exciting.

351
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,120
You say at the pub, "I cut
the roof off a Porsche!"

352
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,080
It's better than
a Golf or a Hyundai.

353
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,440
- It's a better story.
- Exactly.

354
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,920
I know why they're doing it.

355
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,680
To be brutally honest, they're
doing it because they can.

356
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,280
They should take a lesson
from the Queen.

357
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,280
She's been the Queen now
for, what, 65 years?

358
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,200
Now, she has the constitutional
right and power...

359
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,040
Weirdly this is... this is,
actually their display team.

360
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
This bit better go in,

361
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,240
because that's gonna be un
ing editable, that is!

362
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
They should take a lesson
from the Queen.

363
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,080
- She's been in power now, what, 65 years?
- Yeah.

364
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,360
She has the constitutional right to
declare war on another country, OK?

365
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,240
She can do that,
and she never has.

366
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,000
How long would you last before you
declared war if you had the ability?

367
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,320
- I'd give it two days, and it'd be all-out war.
- Exactly.

368
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,080
"I'm declaring war on France.
That's what I'm doing."

369
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,160
Well, you would if you could, that's
the problem. That's why they do it.

370
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,600
I sympathise with the fire brigade, because
I bought a chainsaw the other day.

371
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,640
- Oh, my God! Are you sure?
- No, I did.

372
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,080
But when you've got a chainsaw,
you use it for everything.

373
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,360
I was thinking, "I've got to carve the
Sunday joint. I'll get the chainsaw."

374
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,280
Opening a letter, get the chainsaw.
Bread, use the chainsaw.

375
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,720
Your eyebrows could do
with a bit of a trim.

376
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,960
As soon as the show's over, they're
coming off with a chainsaw.

377
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,760
- You've got it, so you use one.
- Exactly.

378
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,640
- They've got jaws of life?
- Jaws of life.

379
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,840
They're gonna use it,
and they are doing.

380
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,520
We've got an important message actually
for all firemen and firemenwomen.

381
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,160
Stop cutting the roofs...

382
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,680
Sorry!

383
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,880
I think that's right.
That's right, mate.

384
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,560
- It's equal opportunities, what's the matter with you?
- It's a modern world.

385
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,200
Stop cutting the roofs off
our cars or we'll come round

386
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,400
and cut the roof off your
painting and decorating van.

387
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,360
That's covered the fire brigade.

388
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,880
- Yep.
- Hope we don't need them any time soon.

389
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,200
So do I, cos we're gonna be
trapped in a car, "Please!"

390
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,720
Aston Martin's launched this.
It's the new Vantage.

391
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,960
That looks great.

392
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,560
Absolutely spectacular.

393
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,600
That actually looks like the one-off
Aston they made for the Bond film.

394
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,800
Oh, from the back especially. Have you
got a picture of it from the back?

395
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,360
I mean, that is just
a spectacular-looking thing,

396
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,280
and it's been fitted with the twin-turbo
charged four-litre V8 from Mercedes.

397
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,840
- The AMG engine.
- Yeah.

398
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,680
And that is just brilliant.

399
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,360
It's the work actually of the man with
the best name in the motor industry.

400
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,680
No, second best name.

401
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,640
Man with the best name is
Lamborghini's chief test driver.

402
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,560
- He's called Max Venturi.
- Yeah.

403
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,800
- He's never had sex.
- No, no, no.

404
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,200
- He's young and good-looking as well.
- Yes, I know.

405
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,000
Anyway, the guy at Aston, their technical
officer, is called Max "Szwaj".

406
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,000
- What?
- Max "Szwaj".

407
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,280
- "Szwaj"?
- No, "Sz".

408
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,880
- That's what I said "Szwa".
- No, it's "Sz".

409
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,400
- You sound like a broken dentist drill, "Szwaj".
- You're just being racist.

410
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,200
- I'm not!
- You are, the man's Irish.

411
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,560
- I'm not being racist!
- Just cos you want him to be called Paddy O'Malley!

412
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,520
I didn't say... You can't accuse
me of being racist on television!

413
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,840
Anyway, we'll gloss over
your frankly...

414
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,960
- I'm not. That is...
- It's embarrassing.

415
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,640
They've also... He,
I should say, Max "Szwaj",

416
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,520
has also put the Mercedes
engine in the DB11.

417
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,920
And I love that engine,
and I love that car.

418
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,120
That's gonna be
one hell of a combination.

419
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,000
Could be amazing.
How much will it be?

420
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,440
Well, weirdly,
not much less than the V12.

421
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,160
But I think that the V8 will be better
cos the engine will be lighter.

422
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,800
So what you're saying, in
fact, is smaller is better.

423
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,160
No.

424
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,960
You know Chinese companies like to
give themselves Western names, OK?

425
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,960
- I know what you mean.
- Well, there's a Chinese spare part company.

426
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,960
They do brakes and what have
you, that's called, erm, this.

427
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,880
Well, well, it's...

428
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,000
- Thing is--
- It's memorable, isn't it?

429
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,600
Thing is, though, if you
type that into Google...

430
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,480
Oh, don't!

431
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,360
You've really got some strong images for 27
pages before you get to your brake disks.

432
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,920
Sitting there an hour later
with eyes like that.

433
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,960
"Only wanted some brake pads, and now
I've seen things I can't unsee!"

434
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,880
What were you looking for
when you came across...?

435
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,800
What had you put in?

436
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,600
Had you been through all 27,000
pages to get to that one?

437
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,200
I was just looking at.

438
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,000
Oh!

439
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,720
And that is the end of this
week's Conversation Street.

440
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,760
That's very kind, thank you.

441
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,800
Thank you, and now it's time
to get back to our film

442
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,800
in which we're proving that Jaguar's
reputation for unreliability

443
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,160
is completely unfounded.

444
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,840
Yes, we pick up the action at a hotel
where, because we're driving Jags,

445
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,800
we'd spent the night in rooms as far away
as possible from the reception desk,

446
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,080
and its pesky
checking-out requirements.

447
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,240
The next morning we were
up way before the hotel staff,

448
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,240
to get back on the road.

449
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,160
- Morning.
- Morning.

450
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,000
What's with the towels?

451
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,080
Well, they had
this sign that explained

452
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,960
how environmentally damaging and
expensive it is to wash them,

453
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,120
so I've saved them the trouble.

454
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,800
- That's good thinking.
- That's kind.

455
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,760
That is.

456
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,400
Because we'd had
such an early start,

457
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,920
we decided after
a little while to pull over

458
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,800
and admire some of the
beautiful rock formations.

459
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,240
Do you see the sandstone has been

460
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:21,760
eroded by time, wind, and the
pressure of water seeping through it.

461
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,880
It's baffling, isn't it,
how a simple stream

462
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:33,440
can have carved such
an extraordinary gorge.

463
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,920
I don't think there's any
point continuing to do that.

464
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,920
I think you're going to just
melt the starter motor.

465
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,480
Now, it's a heck of
a battery, though.

466
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,680
How have you managed
to break it so quickly?

467
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,400
- Literally we left the hotel...
- You've had it five minutes!

468
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,640
...40 minutes ago.

469
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,560
It's something I've done.
It's certainly not the car.

470
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,920
- Look at those cross braces.
- Mm.

471
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,560
I fitted those as well,
that it didn't have before.

472
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,920
Because the problem
was bound to be minor,

473
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,000
James and I left Richard to it

474
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,280
and continued onwards
to our next destination.

475
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,120
This is one hell of a road!

476
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:21,240
Surface is good. Scenery is fantastic.
No traffic.

477
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,520
These were ideal conditions
for a Jag like mine.

478
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,320
One of the things I
absolutely love about the XJR

479
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,800
is the way the faster you go, the
more it starts to sort of float.

480
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,520
It's like you're sort of
powder skiing.

481
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,960
It actually encourages you to go
faster because you're so relaxed.

482
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,680
This, let's not forget, is a
155-mile-an-hour machine.

483
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,840
Nought to 60,
five-and-a-half seconds.

484
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,000
It's quick,
even by today's standards.

485
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:07,080
Right, problem is fuel pump not working,
that's because there's no power to it.

486
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,040
But the really clever thing
about a Jaguar

487
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,720
is you get lots of
spare stuff you can use

488
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,320
when a problem arises, should
it, which is very unlikely.

489
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,880
In this instance, I disconnected this
which powers the electric aerial.

490
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,800
That has got power. Obviously I can
do without the electric aerial.

491
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,400
I didn't want to use it anyway.

492
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,640
Hook this up to the fuel
pump, job done, we're away.

493
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:30,120
Sure enough, he was
soon back on the move...

494
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,120
I love this thing.
It's a beautiful little car.

495
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,800
...unlike me.

496
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:46,280
Not that this is much of an issue
for someone who's driving a Jag!

497
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,240
Yes, Constable, however,

498
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,080
if I could draw your attention to
the first page of my passport here,

499
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,080
"Her Britannic Majesty..."
that's the Queen,

500
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,920
"...requests and requires
in the name of Her Majesty,

501
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,560
all those whom it may concern to
allow the bearer..." that's me,

502
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,120
"...to pass freely without
let or hindrance."

503
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,440
Did you get away with that?

504
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,240
Yeah, I just hit him
with the passport thing.

505
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,360
Very good, yes.

506
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,600
Honestly, it works every time.
It never fails in America.

507
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,200
I also told the officer I was
travelling with Mrs May,

508
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,680
the British Prime Minister.

509
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,880
And he believed me!

510
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,240
Meanwhile, quite a few miles
further back...

511
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,360
That's... just having a rest.

512
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,680
Oh, it's a Brit
and it's overheated.

513
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,080
No, no, it's fine.

514
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,680
Do you know why
the English like warm beer?

515
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,240
Because Lucas
makes refrigerators, too!

516
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,000
- Good, thank you so much!
- Yeah, you bet!

517
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,160
Oh, this isn't helping our case.

518
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,200
Higher in the sky,

519
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,480
James and I had arrived at the
location for our next challenge...

520
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,400
...a runway.

521
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,000
And once our colleague
had arrived,

522
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,720
I explained what
Mr Wilman had planned.

523
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,960
We'll go from here,
one at a time, 0-100,

524
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,080
and then back to 0 again.

525
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,960
You've got to stop before the end of the
runway, and really do have to stop,

526
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,400
because this airport has a...
a slightly unusual feature.

527
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,760
Perched on the summit
of a rocky mountain,

528
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:01,080
Telluride is the highest
commercial airport in the US.

529
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,000
And at the end of the runway,
there is...

530
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,560
...nothing.

531
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,680
Just a 1,000 foot drop
to an uncomfortable end.

532
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,520
Here we go!

533
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,440
Yes, there it is!

534
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,480
It has got some shove, that.

535
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,080
Forced induction of course is what
you need at this kind of altitude.

536
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,600
That's why super-chargers were fitted
to the Spitfire and the Messerschmitt.

537
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,440
That's 80...

538
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,160
90...

539
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,400
There's 100!

540
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,120
Oh, the brakes are medium
good and that's a worry...

541
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,760
...for Hammond and May.

542
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,760
On the plus side, that's further
proof of the power of a Jaguar.

543
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,560
On the negative side, Jeremy isn't
now going, "Argh!" which is a shame.

544
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,320
It is, the other thing
we need to bear in mind

545
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,200
is that his car is very much the most
powerful one here, and you're going next.

546
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,760
Why am I going next?

547
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,520
Because I just said you're going
next, and that's like a bagsie.

548
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,960
- That's how a Jag driver would work.
- Right!

549
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,680
Three, two, one, begin.

550
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,840
Ohh, yeah! I think it's lost
some ponies over the years.

551
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,680
The big question is,
will his ancient XJ6

552
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,800
be able to beat the yardstick
I've laid down?

553
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,200
Er... 55.

554
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,720
60.

555
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,040
Still accelerating.

556
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,640
You're gonna have to
work a bit harder, Jaguar!

557
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,360
You really are, because
that's not good enough!

558
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,560
Still...

559
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,800
85.

560
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,680
Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness
the death of Richard Hammond, again.

561
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,800
Nearly!

562
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,240
100!

563
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,680
Oh, my God!

564
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,200
Ah!

565
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,800
And... shut down.

566
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,480
How much excrement?

567
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,600
Erm... well, brown seats would
have been a better choice.

568
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,360
- Yeah. Your braking?
- Erm... Vigorous.

569
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,200
Would you like to know how
much further you went than me?

570
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,720
- Yeah, go on.
- 0.4 of a mile...

571
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,400
...of a mile!

572
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,520
Finally it was my turn and I
was going to need as much runway

573
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,640
and as much streamlining
as possible,

574
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,200
for good reason.

575
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,320
Now we're alone, viewers,
I'm gonna admit to you

576
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,720
that my car has gone
into "limp home" mode,

577
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,040
which is not ideal
for this sort of thing.

578
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,360
In three, two, one.

579
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,200
40.

580
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,240
He's moving.
I mean, just barely but...

581
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,640
50.

582
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,200
60.

583
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,200
He's still accelerating!

584
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,120
70.

585
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,960
75!

586
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,280
80 miles... 80.
80 miles an hour.

587
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,360
90!

588
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,640
Oh, my God!

589
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,520
Argh!

590
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,120
Ow! Ooh!

591
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,520
Ow!

592
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,960
Having completed the 0-100
and back to 0 test,

593
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,120
we got back on the road.

594
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,680
Well, all credit to James's XK8.

595
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,280
He's come out of it unharmed
and the car pretty much, too.

596
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,680
If anything, the engine seems
to have become even smoother,

597
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,760
almost as if it's gained
50% more cylinders.

598
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,720
But that's the thing about
Jags, they just get better.

599
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,040
With all three cars
still running well,

600
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:58,040
we headed off to face our final
and toughest challenge...

601
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,160
...in the ski resort
of Telluride.

602
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,800
- They applauded your death.
- They did.

603
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,160
- They applauded your death.
- Thank you very much!

604
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,040
I have to say though, James,
it really was extraordinary

605
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,080
that you went down that
1,000-foot fall, not a scratch.

606
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,120
Completely unharmed.

607
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,160
It's weird that Jag don't make
more of that in their commercials.

608
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,760
Anyway,
we'll pick that up later on.

609
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,200
Now though, it's time for
Celebrity Face Off.

610
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:46,280
Yeah, and today we are asking another
important question, and it's this.

611
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,880
Who is the world's fastest actor,
whose middle name is George?

612
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,960
Surprisingly hard to find contenders
for this one, but we've managed it.

613
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,840
So please welcome Luke Evans
and Kiefer Sutherland!

614
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,880
Jack Bauer! How are you?

615
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,200
You. How are you?
Have a seat.

616
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,560
No messing about this week!
We are not messing about.

617
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,600
Can I just explain
before we start? Yes.

618
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,000
- You get a Canadian flag because you're Canadian?
- Yeah.

619
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,360
- But if you win it'll become British.
- It'll become British.

620
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,800
- Because you were born...
- I was born in London.

621
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,360
- Born in London, so do you have a British passport?
- I do.

622
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,480
- And you're a Canadian citizen?
- Yes.

623
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,600
- But you live in America?
- Yes.

624
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,040
I am a well-travelled man!

625
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,640
Yeah. You travel
the colonies. Erm...

626
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,440
- You're Welsh whatever happens.
- Good.

627
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,520
Now, this business
of middle names...

628
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,640
- You've just got the one middle name?
- Yes.

629
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,520
- Which is George?
- George, yes.

630
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,440
- You...
- I've got the five.

631
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,080
Which are...

632
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,600
Kiefer William Frederick Dempsey
George Rufus Sutherland.

633
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,280
Ah, wow!

634
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,880
- So, your dad--
- My father owed a lot of people money!

635
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,400
I think he would just say, "I can't pay
you, but I'll name my son after you."

636
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,280
Now we'll get onto you,
Luke, if we may.

637
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,240
Obviously, your new blockbuster
is Beauty And The Beast.

638
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,760
But you're best known, certainly among
this audience, I should imagine-

639
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,280
- I've a feeling I know which one it is.
- Fast and Furious.

640
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,280
- Yeah.
- Fast and Furious 6.

641
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,720
Yeah.

642
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,440
Now, what fascinates me about this
Fast and Furious business is somehow

643
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,280
you make a living from driving around,
smashing up very expensive cars.

644
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,280
I mean, how is that
even possible?

645
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,520
You tell me.

646
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,440
Touché.

647
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,680
- It must be a riot.
- It is a riot, yeah.

648
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,040
Especially when they... they
make them from scratch,

649
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,360
like the flip car
that I drove in Fast 6.

650
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,440
That was hand-made by
this genius in Los Angeles

651
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,960
who makes all
the cars in the films.

652
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,520
- And the flip car was--
- It's got a tongue on it...

653
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,080
It's basically like
a door wedge, basically,

654
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,320
which had, I think it was
a Formula One engine.

655
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,200
But it was just the shell,
so the sound was deafening.

656
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,640
We all had to have ear plugs and
stuff and... But it was great.

657
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,720
All the wheels could crab, so they
all could turn at the same time,

658
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,000
so you go could go underneath
lorries, trailer lorries.

659
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,240
- They're tricky to drive, I presume.
- Very tricky.

660
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,680
It was, erm... it wasn't a normal
sort of gear shift. It was a ratchet.

661
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,960
So you'd have to press a button and
then you had to pump the clutch

662
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,080
then you had to ratchet it up to
first, and it was so complicated.

663
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,520
- While doing acting?
- While doing acting, yeah.

664
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,720
See, he's so cool, why would
you have me on the show?

665
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,600
No, I mean, you do crash even
more cars than Hammond does.

666
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,000
I've got the figures here.

667
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,960
You've destroyed, or the
Fast And Furious people,

668
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,960
- 1,478 cars...
- Wow!

669
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,120
...in the franchise, which is quite a lot.
Someone worked out the cost.

670
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,760
- You've only done £3.7 million worth of damage.
- That's not bad.

671
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,280
Jason Statham's got through 148
million quid's worth of cars.

672
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,480
Actually, Richard Hammond has
provided me with a question here.

673
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,920
He said, "Is it because
he can't drive very well?"

674
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,400
I did not say that! I didn't! Why
would I fall out with Jason Statham?

675
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,080
- I didn't say that!
- You thought it.

676
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,080
Can he drive? I've always
wanted to get Jason...

677
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,880
I have no idea!
Yes, I'm sure, yeah. I...

678
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,880
- Are you sure he can't drive? There you go, Hammond.
- I didn't ask that!

679
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,360
I'm sure he can.

680
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,160
Did you crash any cars? Not to
the extent they do, but did you?

681
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,840
No, actually, I was thinking how
cool all your stories were.

682
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,200
Mine was so embarrassing.

683
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,920
Er... I had a scene,
all I had to do,

684
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,840
and a very normal car,
the wheels didn't crab,

685
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,800
I just had to drive it to the mark, get
out, draw my weapon and say something.

686
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,680
And that day they had
a really wonderful actress.

687
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,320
I had a bit of a crush on her, and
I was really trying to show off.

688
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,960
And I spun the car a bit, threw it
into a stop, threw open the door,

689
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,840
pulled out my weapon, said my line
and slowly the car passed me.

690
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,560
I had forgot... I had
forgot to put it in park.

691
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:11,080
And er... and it hit the fence that the camera
operator was sitting on and he fell off.

692
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,120
The girl never talked to me again
and that was the end of my day.

693
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,080
We'll get onto cars cos you both started
with Mustangs, I think I'm right in saying.

694
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,560
- Yeah.
- Well, sort of yeah.

695
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,960
- You were very late to...
- Yeah, I was 30 when I passed my driving test.

696
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,160
I'd never been to LA, and I had
to go there for a screen test,

697
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,600
and the first time I got in a car on my
own was a hire car from LAX Airport,

698
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,080
which was a Mustang, and then I
went on the 405 to West Hollywood.

699
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,400
- Shat myself.
- That'll teach you how to drive!

700
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,880
My hands were so wet that they were
sliding off the steering wheel.

701
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,360
- And the steering wheel's on the wrong side of the road.
- I mean, five lanes!

702
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,320
I do love saying wrong side of the road
in front of people who aren't...

703
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,320
It's the right side of the road.
We're the idiots.

704
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,320
No, we're not.
No, we're not!

705
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,120
Steering wheel's on the wrong side,
on the wrong side of the road.

706
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,320
- The 405 is a nightmare.
- It's hell.

707
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,960
- I'd not want to do my first solo drive.
- Yeah.

708
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,640
- Now your first car was a--
- My first car was a 1967 Mustang.

709
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,480
And er... I had a couple of
jobs in New York,

710
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,800
that allowed me to buy the car.

711
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,560
Then I was gonna drive it
from New York to Los Angeles,

712
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,160
where I had another job
waiting for me.

713
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,560
And I was driving across Texas,

714
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,720
and this was the cheaper
model of the 1967 Mustang.

715
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,800
It was a straight-six,
not a lot of power.

716
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,920
And I guess there was an
80-mile-an-hour wind coming east.

717
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,560
I was trying to go west, and the
wind was more powerful than my car

718
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,080
so in the middle of the
highway it just stopped.

719
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,720
And, I'm not
a mechanically-inclined guy

720
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,840
so I got rid of the Mustang
as quickly as I could.

721
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,480
You, on the other hand, are
mechanically-minded, aren't you?

722
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,880
Yeah, well, my best mate as I
grew up was a farmer's boy

723
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,960
and so I was always
on the farms with him.

724
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,560
And there was, like, tractors
and quads and motorbikes.

725
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,320
- Are you a bike enthusiast?
- My dad is a big biker. Like, big, big biker.

726
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,120
So I was always on
the back of his bike.

727
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,280
Pillion passengers through
the Brecon Beacons, you know?

728
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,120
Did your dad have a 1600E?

729
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,440
That was...
Yeah, when I was born,

730
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,240
he had a 1600E Cortina
in azure blue,

731
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,240
and when I was born, he put
my name on his number plate.

732
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,160
I grew up with this
very special car.

733
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,360
Well, now you're into
my specialist subject here.

734
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,120
You may have to tune out for
a moment here, because to...

735
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,280
I don't think it was available
in blue, the 1600E.

736
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,680
No. It wasn't. But you'll need
to ask him the answer to that.

737
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,440
- Why, is he here?
- He's there.

738
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,000
- Was it, how did you get...? He's brought his dad?
- Brought my dad, yeah.

739
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,295
- Have you brought your dad?

740
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,640
- No.
- That'd be hilarious.

741
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,120
How did you have
a blue Cortina 1600E?

742
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,520
Well, the Mark Ils
came out in the silver fox,

743
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,960
but after a few years
they started to fade.

744
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,280
- So I bought one and I had it re-sprayed.
- You painted it?

745
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,480
- I thought, I sort of...
- Stylish for a Valley boy!

746
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,680
Azure blue, I mean, come on!

747
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,880
I had a 1600E. It was amber gold.
They were the coolest cars.

748
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,280
- Do you remember it?
- Yeah, I do remember it. It was beautiful.

749
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,120
I mean, I remember that I chipped the...
the walnut, er, dashboard,

750
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,840
cos I was in the car like this with my
teeth, and he'd braked and I split.

751
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,120
I literally have guilt even now
and I was only five at the time.

752
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,360
Your dad was cross with you for smashing
your teeth out cos he braked too hard?

753
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,960
Oh, yeah, the car was
everything, like yeah.

754
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,800
You smashed your
face in on the dashboard?

755
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,960
Yeah, I lost my front teeth, but it
was the walnut veneer that was the...

756
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,280
This is the Poor Parenting Award here, this is.

757
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,920
Now we've got to find out,

758
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,200
well, basically whether we're gonna
call you Canadian or British.

759
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,120
Who wants to see their laps?

760
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,160
- So, Kiefer, we're gonna have a look at yours first.
- OK.

761
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,440
So, here we go.

762
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,640
It's a beautiful day once
again in the heartland of England.

763
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,640
Accelerate.
Accelerate, brake.

764
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,600
That's the right way to do it.
Oh, cutting that corner nicely.

765
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,200
It's tricky here cos you've got to
slow down then get on the power,

766
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,320
which you've done very well
as you go left

767
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,800
and into what we're calling
The Difficult Bit.

768
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,960
And there we go.

769
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Oh, that's tidy.
That is tidy. Not exuberant.

770
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,720
Through the banked turned, the Gravelsel,
and back down toward the Difficult Bit Two.

771
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,280
I must say you are holding that
very nicely through there.

772
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,920
We had the traction control wound
back so you've got a loose rear end.

773
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,240
Now it goes very slippery.
Oh, nicely held there.

774
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,640
On the power ready to go down the straight
bit that isn't really very straight,

775
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,920
like our other track.

776
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,720
Hell, let's see if
you've got any bottle.

777
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,120
Supposed to be flat through. Oh... that
is actually very quick through there!

778
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,680
That is very nicely done indeed.

779
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,440
Hard on the brakes and
through the last corner

780
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,600
also very nicely
and across the line.

781
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,160
That is tidy!

782
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,800
Tidy lap. It was quite good.

783
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,240
- You've got people that are very helpful out there.
- Yeah. Well, they do.

784
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,400
They teach you how, but then you've
got to go solo. You have to do it.

785
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,240
- So how was yours, good fun?
- I loved it.

786
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,240
I didn't want to get out. They
had to peel me out of the car!

787
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,880
Who'd like to see the lap?

788
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,760
Come on.
Let's have a look at Luke's.

789
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,720
Come on!

790
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,720
OK, right. Also cutting
the corner, taking it...

791
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,920
I think it's a good idea
to go sl... Oh, ha-ha.

792
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,240
Just about hold it together
and onto the gravel.

793
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,480
Listen to that exhaust popping away,
that's good for a two-litre engine, that.

794
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,200
Oh, exuberant! Coming wide
through there, that looks good.

795
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,400
This gravel is crazy!

796
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:57,440
It's not necessarily the fastest way to
have the arse of it hanging out like that,

797
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,120
but it does look good.

798
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,480
Right, yeah, looking good
through there as well.

799
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,360
This is keeping it tidier,
this is better.

800
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,120
It can get a bit fish-taily down here if
you're not careful, but it's all right.

801
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,800
And onto the slippery,
dusty bit.

802
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,440
Keeping it wide.

803
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,680
Now, flat-out. Do you keep it
flat through the last corner?

804
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,800
Now I should brake,
but I'm not gonna.

805
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,640
Are you not gonna brake?
No, you are not!

806
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,080
Oh, though, that is fast,
nearly losing it,

807
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,200
but just got it together in time
to brake for the last corner.

808
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,760
Nicely held through there
and across the line!

809
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,120
Well done.

810
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,760
Well done.

811
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,560
Right. I have got
your times here.

812
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,040
So, Kiefer Sutherland,

813
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:53,680
you did it in
one minute... 17.8.

814
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,720
- OK.
- I'll pop that up there, now.

815
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,720
Luke Evans. One minute...

816
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,440
...21.3.

817
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,000
So, there's nothing
we can do about that.

818
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,760
I loved it.

819
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,000
- Now you're British!
- Oh, great!

820
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,640
Can't resist it.

821
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,840
So there we are.

822
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,480
Just in case you're thinking, "Oh, no,
I'm gonna have to hang myself..."

823
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,960
We've had a 1:24.4. 1:24.1. 1:23.6. 1:23.

824
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,080
You're actually there
the fifth fastest.

825
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,720
So that's really not a bad time.

826
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,760
It's just his was stellar,
absolutely stellar.

827
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,640
There we are,
ladies and gentlemen,

828
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,720
Luke Evans and the
fastest actor in the world

829
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,960
whose middle name is George,
Kiefer Sutherland!

830
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,440
Thank you very much.

831
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,840
Brilliant!

832
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,560
Now, thank you.

833
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,080
Now, tonight we are proving

834
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,560
that old Jaguars are
reliable and brilliant.

835
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,320
Yep, and we rejoin the action
just as we are about to embark

836
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:17,000
on one of the biggest challenges
us three have ever faced,

837
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,040
avoiding the expense of ski
passes and hiring all the kit,

838
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,240
by going skiing in our cars.

839
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,920
Easter Sunday, Telluride.

840
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,560
Rich pickings for a man
with a Jag.

841
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,400
Hello, my dear.

842
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,760
Having found somewhere to park,

843
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,200
Hammond checked into the hotel.

844
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,560
Check-in please. Thank you. Can
I borrow your pen? Thank you.

845
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,760
You can fill that out.
And right here is your key.

846
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,200
- Room number, Wi-Fi.
- Oh, thank you very much. Thank you.

847
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,400
I, meanwhile,
headed for the restaurant.

848
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,400
It's definitely corked.

849
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,600
Sorry.

850
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,240
The next morning,
it was cold outside.

851
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,000
So, we needed warm clothes for
our trip up the mountains.

852
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:12,560
James therefore
went shopping, Jag-style.

853
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,320
And I didn't.

854
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:25,160
Welcome to the hotel, sir. I
could take your... your coat.

855
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,440
Thank you very much.

856
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,280
- Had a pleasant trip?
- Yes. Yes, thank you.

857
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,360
- Your hat?
- Oh, well, thank you.

858
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,560
Perhaps your bag as well,
sir. Thank you very much.

859
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,320
If you'd like to see my colleague on
reception that would be marvellous.

860
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,720
- Excellent.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

861
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,600
Right, that's my warm weather
gear sorted out.

862
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,440
I actually nicked that idea
from Peter Sellers.

863
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,200
Don't think he'll mind because
of course, he had a Jag.

864
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,960
Once we were fully equipped
with suitable clothing,

865
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,840
we drove straight
past the lifts,

866
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,320
and hit the gradients.

867
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,920
Ha-ha, slopes.

868
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,840
Here we go. Speed and power.

869
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:15,120
Unfortunately, for once, speed and
power didn't seem to do the trick.

870
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:19,520
Oh... Ski, damn you!
Come on ski, Jag!

871
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:24,320
We're going to have to admit
this isn't working.

872
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,920
Luckily, James then
had a brainwave.

873
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,360
And down at the resort's workshop,
he borrowed some metal poles,

874
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,400
which he used to
shackle our cars together.

875
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,840
If this works,
I'll eat my own head.

876
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,560
Six-wheel drive,
all at the same time.

877
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:53,520
Right, everybody select drive
in three, two, one... Gently.

878
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,280
Yes! I think we've got this.

879
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,280
Yeah!

880
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,000
We're like The Human Centipede!

881
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,440
Yeah, no, I got that wrong.

882
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,160
Oh, hello... James is going a bit skewy.
I'll give him more power.

883
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,560
Hammond, you're jack-knifing
me towards the edge.

884
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,600
Or Clarkson,
one of you, somebody.

885
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,800
I'm not doing anything!
You're steering.

886
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,000
You're at the front. You're
the head of this caterpillar!

887
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,800
I'm not steering!
You are. It's jack-knife...

888
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,480
No, it's the edge!
Stop, stop!

889
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,840
Right, everybody in reverse.

890
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,920
Three, two, one, gently go.

891
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,520
- Jeremy, where are you going?
- You're the one that steers us going backwards.

892
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,160
I wasn't steering you
that way, why are you there?

893
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,280
- You've jack-knifed us Hammond, you stupid idiot!
- I'm not doing that!

894
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,200
I'm not!

895
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,520
Eventually,
after much bickering...

896
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,640
You're pushing me over
the edge, you blithering...

897
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,200
When you're going
backwards, you're steering you.

898
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,680
- Whose idea was this?
- Hammond, you're doing it again.

899
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,040
...we started to
get the hang of it.

900
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:22,040
I knew this would work. All you got
to do is co-ordinate the brains.

901
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,440
This is what comes from many,
many years of working together,

902
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,560
that intuitive bond
that links us.

903
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,600
Bond of hatred.

904
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,080
And there we are, the summit.

905
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,160
12,500 feet.

906
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,760
We have made it!

907
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,320
Ho-ho!

908
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,240
Good. Right, let's unhitch.

909
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:13,400
Having bypassed the lifts and
cable cars, it was time to start skiing.

910
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,440
Which was a bit of a worry.

911
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,200
Don't look over that edge.

912
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,680
But there's a bit of...
It gets really steep.

913
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,560
People do this for fun, yeah?

914
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,000
- Not in old Jags.
- Oh, yeah, you're right.

915
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:31,560
If you went wrong here, look. You'd have
time to phone your insurance company.

916
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,400
You'd start
filling the form out.

917
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,160
There's the airfield, look.

918
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,480
I can see Heathrow from here.

919
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,800
But, since the only way
down was down, we set off.

920
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,680
Gingerly.

921
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:53,000
Just an ordinary drive.
Just an ordinary drive.

922
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,480
Oh... Oh.

923
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,920
Jeez, that's... Don't look.

924
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,480
Erm... there's an... Oh, God.

925
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,880
It's in case I need to bail out.

926
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,880
Steering wheel's
working a bit... Ah!

927
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,280
Ooh!

928
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:26,000
Oh, gawd. What you've got to be wary
of is losing the back of the car.

929
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,200
Ooh! Oh, cripes.

930
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,520
Practise braking.
Practise braking.

931
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,400
Nothing.

932
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,640
Just going to write a book while
we don't stop. Still not stopping.

933
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,560
Picking up speed! Oh, my God!

934
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,640
Got no control now.

935
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,680
Ah... it won't stop!

936
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:52,880
I'm going to hit that tree.
There's nothing... No.

937
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,240
Jesus Christ!

938
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,840
Mercifully, the gradient
eventually levelled out,

939
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,520
but then it became very narrow.

940
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,760
Oh, my God!
Look at the drop on our left.

941
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,440
Holy shit.

942
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,720
It's... Oh, God.

943
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,240
Oh!
That's genuinely alarming!

944
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,280
I'm crabbing.

945
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,160
Bloody hell.

946
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,880
Just, why don't you just go
in a straight line?

947
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,240
Just please, just briefly...

948
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:38,600
James, is your car crabbing
as well for absolutely no reason?

949
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,680
Yeah,
it's absolutely terrifying.

950
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,800
Oh. Oh.

951
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,040
Don't look at the view.
Don't look at the drop.

952
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,440
Ing hell, this is scary.

953
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,320
Ah... oh.

954
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:00,000
Oh, shit. Shit, shit!

955
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,960
Having not fallen over
the terrifying drop,

956
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,360
we then had to drive down one.

957
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,040
Holy mother of God!

958
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,320
Oh, my God!

959
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,480
Oh, my giddy aunt.

960
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,960
This is quick now.

961
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,520
Oh-ho-ho!

962
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:29,560
I'm gonna change up a gear. That was a
mistake. That was a massive mistake.

963
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,640
Just go in a straight line,
you bastard.

964
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,480
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.

965
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,560
Oh!

966
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:50,040
But none of us died, and then
Jag-skiing started to come together.

967
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:04,480
Oh, yes, I'm slalom skiing now is what
I'm doing, and I'm doing it well!

968
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,360
Ya-ha-ha!

969
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,840
Ho-ho!

970
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:18,320
And let's be honest,
after one day on normal skis,

971
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,400
you'd still be pretty rubbish.

972
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:25,760
Whereas here,
we are absolutely brilliant.

973
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,240
Love to do this with other people
on the slopes at the same time.

974
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,000
Could actually
run into a snowboarder.

975
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,360
"Oh, I'm sorry,
was that annoying?

976
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,240
Now you know
what it feels like."

977
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:41,040
Eventually, we started on the
final leg down into the town,

978
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,480
and Richard and I
got into a bit of a race.

979
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,480
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

980
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,960
Give me a little bit more go.

981
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,600
Oh, bumpy, oh, very bumpy.
Very bumpy.

982
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,480
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, no!

983
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,160
Whoa, that was a biggy!

984
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,080
Meanwhile,
a little further back...

985
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:09,240
Oh, gawd! I've got
a brake warning light on.

986
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,560
I don't know what that means. Pad wear?
System failure? God knows.

987
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,000
There's the town.

988
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:21,920
We're coming in
hot and stylishly.

989
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:26,080
And we wouldn't have to walk
to the hotel in silly boots.

990
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,760
We'd simply drive there.

991
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,600
Oh, hello.

992
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,720
Whoa!

993
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,800
Whaagh!

994
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,280
Oh-ho-ho-no!

995
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:43,200
Oh ho-ho-ho!
Oh, there's been an accident.

996
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,840
- Ah.
- Damn.

997
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,200
Right.

998
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,920
Only we...

999
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:57,200
No, look, we meant to park
them there, they look good.

1000
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,920
Oh, no!

1001
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:03,800
Just keep working, brakes, for
another ten seconds or so.

1002
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,160
Exactly where we
wanted them to be,

1003
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,400
and that's where they are,
and that's good.

1004
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:13,160
Er... anyway, the thing is that
we got here... well, there,

1005
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:17,920
without a single problem, and
with a very definite conclusion.

1006
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,640
- Buy an XJR.
- Whoa, no, hang on!

1007
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:25,200
The point of this exercise was to
demonstrate Jaguar's reliability as a make.

1008
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,360
Yes, but we have,
and we've also...

1009
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,440
What? Oh.

1010
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,200
Oh, er...

1011
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:44,960
Brilliant, so we get
all the way to the very end,

1012
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,360
and then you ruin it.

1013
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,880
It was hardly my fault,
was it? The brakes failed!

1014
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,040
But now you've just told everybody!

1015
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,440
And now they all think that Jaguars
have faults, and they won't buy one.

1016
01:02:55,480 --> 01:03:00,080
Which means this entire programme
has been a complete waste of time.

1017
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,520
And on that terrible
disappointment, it's time to end.

1018
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:05,360
Thank you so much for watching,
see you next time. Goodbye.
