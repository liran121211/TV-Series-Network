Thank you so much.

And welcome, and thank you all

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,080
for braving these treacherous

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,080
I nearly fell over once, but I made it.

Don't worry,

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,520
because we have an incredible
reward for you all.

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,720
Because, in this action-packed show...

18
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,720
..James wears a red anorak...

19
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,440
..Richard looks at a pipe
of some sort...

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,640
..and I make a cup of tea.

(CHEERING)

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,560
It is non-stop action.

Non-stop. But...
but we begin with mankind.

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,440
- Wow! Big start!
- It is a big start.

25
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,280
You see, the thing is, as a species,

26
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,080
we are very pleased with ourselves,

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,680
because we have the Porsche 918

28
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,960
and the Ferrari TheFerrari:

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,200
cars that can travel at
212mph, an incredible speed.

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,800
Whereas cows and ants and...

31
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,200
- What are you going on about?
- Well, think about it, OK.

32
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,240
A cow is exactly the same now

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,840
as it was a million years ago.

34
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,720
Well, maybe a bit more delicious now,

35
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,920
but basically the same.

36
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,480
It still stands around all day long

37
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,920
in a field eating grass.

38
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,440
Whereas we think that we've improved.

39
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,360
But have we?

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,480
- Yes.
- Yeah, we have.

41
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,880
Well, now, you say that,

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,320
but we were travelling
at way more than 212mph

43
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,560
in our cars 25 years ago.

44
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,320
JEREMY: This is the Jaguar XJ220.

45
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,120
And with a top speed of 217mph,

46
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,400
it was the fastest car in the world.

47
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,680
For about five minutes.

48
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,560
And then this came along.

49
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,720
The 218mph Bugatti EB 110 Super Sport.

50
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,960
Both these cars
were conceived in the '80s,

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,920
when Gordon Gekko was running amok,

52
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,760
and the world was awash with money.

53
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,400
But by the time they went
on sale in the early '90s...

54
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,400
An incredible day on Wall Street.

55
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,440
The market has fallen over 400 points.

56
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,880
JEREMY: ...the stock market had crashed.

57
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,880
There's only one word to
describe what's happening,

58
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,440
and that is "panic".

59
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,880
JEREMY: So, the only people
who might have bought them

60
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,800
were too busy hurling themselves
out of their office windows

61
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,080
on Wall Street.

62
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,960
So, these cars,
they came, they conquered,

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,840
and no-one noticed.

64
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,520
Today, though, 25 years later,

65
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,960
there are only three cars
in current production

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,880
that are faster than this.

67
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,840
However, while there is
a lot of performance,

68
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,880
the way it's delivered is...
quite old-fashioned.

69
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,040
You put your foot down,
and then you wait

70
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,080
while the turbo-chargers spool up.

71
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,120
It takes quite a while,
cos there are four of them.

74
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,640
However, when the 3.5l V12

75
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,080
is finally getting
all the food it needs...

76
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,160
Oh, God!

77
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,920

80
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,440
Through the corner.

81
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,840
Mild terror.

82
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,920
The speed is hilarious!

83
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,960
And terrifying.

84
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,720
That's probably why they fitted it

85
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,000
with this plastic sheeting
rather than carpets,

86
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,600
because they knew that one
day you would soil yourself.

87
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,240
You did have to be good

88
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,960
to get the best out of this thing.

89
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,400
Which brings me on to
Michael Schumacher.

90
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,680
He could have had any car
he wanted back in the day,

91
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,280
but he had one of these.

92
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,480
Weirdly, however,

93
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,920
and mainly because
I think it looks better,

94
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,240
I'd have chosen the Jag.

95
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,000
It was supposed to have been
a four-wheel drive V12,

96
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,040
like the Bugatti,

97
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,200
but Jaguar found that
much too complicated.

98
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,880
So, they gave it the turbo-charged V6

99
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,440
from a Metro rally car,

100
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,880
rear-wheel drive, the rear
lights from a Rover 200,

101
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,680
and then they said, "That'll do,"

102
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,880
and went to the pub.

103
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,000
So, does that mean the Jag
is embarrassed by the Bugatti

104
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,800
in a drag race?

105
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,640
Right, before we do this,

106
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,240
I have to tape
the cassette player in place,

107
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,080
because the last time I did
a full-bore standing start

108
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,960
in an XJ220,

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,200
the acceleration was so vivid,

of its slot in the dashboard,

111
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,760
ricocheted off the gear lever,

112
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,480
and then speared into my left plum.

113
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
It was very uncomfortable.

114
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,880
Oh, the end's come off.

115
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,760

Whoa! That was some speed!

129
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,240
After a quarter of a mile,

130
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,280
the badly-made Jag was doing 135mph,

131
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,320
and a modern day Lamborghini
Huracan couldn't do that.

132
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,080
Which proves that in the last
25 years, we've come nowhere.

133
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,360
Except, we have.

134
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,400
You see, back in '92 and '93,

135
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,160
there was no Wi-Fi,
there was no PlayStation,

136
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,640
DVD hadn't been invented,

137
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,520
Justin Bieber hadn't been born.

138
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,920
There was no Google, Amazon was a river.

139
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,840
There was no internet pornography.

140
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,360
Well, that's probably a good thing,

141
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,880
cos there was no Viagra, either.

142
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,640
The early '90s were the dark ages,

143
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,360
and when you drive these cars, it shows.

144
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,720
In here, there's no power-steering.

145
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,000
No air conditioning.

146
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,600
No anti-lock brakes.

147
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,080

no driver aids of any kind.

After a couple of laps in this thing,

155
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,560
you really are aching.

156
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,040
And sweating.

157
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,320
And you're frightened. You really are.

158
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,920
Cos this is not a car that's
just gonna forgive you.

you're gonna hit a tree,

than these monsters from the past,

but a modern supercar
makes the speed fun and easy,

No, seriously, well done,

because nobody's ever
finished a road test

171
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,480
with the word "faeces" before.

172
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,720
No, that was a first.

173
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,880
But I'm just thinking,

174
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,320
it isn't just supercars
that are getting slower,

175
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,320
because you remember the Lotus Sunbeam?

176
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,160
- When was that, 1979, '78?
- Yeah.

177
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,920
That did 0-60 in 6.6 seconds,

178
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,240
and there aren't many hot hatches

179
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,920
that would keep up with that,
even today.

180
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,200
And then you've got trains.
The Mallard, the steam train,

181
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,640
is quicker than most electric trains.

182
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,560
SR-71 Blackbird, nothing
in the skies as fast as that.

183
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,880
I suppose, if you think about
it, we used to be able

184
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,000
to get across the Atlantic
in three hours,

185
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,800
- and now it takes us seven.
- Exactly.

186
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,760
And now we must put some
numbers on our argument

187
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,480
by sending the Bugatti
round the Eboladrome.

188
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,360
(ENGINE REVS)

189
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,040
Come on, old-timer!

190
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,080
JEREMY: And she's off.

191
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
A smooth start.

192
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,600
Four-wheel drive system
maintaining traction

193
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,520
in these wet conditions.

194
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,200
It really is soaking out there today!

195
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,760
Right, a measured line
through the first curve,

196
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,240
and then carefully working the throttle

197
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,000
to keep things in check.

198
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,600
Approaching the sweep
down to Your Name Here,

199
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,240
and smoothly done.

200
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,640
(TYRES SQUEAL)

201
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,560
Crikey! Managing to get
the tyres squealing,

202
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,760
even on this damp section.

203
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,920
And then winding up the little V12

204
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,200
to fire it back onto the Isn't.

205
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,880
Single wiper batting away the drizzle,

206
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,040
as she hustles it
towards the braking zone

207
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,040
for the tricky Old Lady's House complex.

208
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,080
How will it get on here?

209
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,800
Very neat.

210
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,160
Very controlled.

211
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,760
And now back on the gas
for the run to Substation.

212
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,640
And you can hear the fizz

213
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,680
from those four
furiously spinning turbos.

214
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,000
Keeping it together there nicely.

215
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,200
Field Of Sheep to go.

216
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,520
Glides through there,
and across the line.

217
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
(CHEERING)

218
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,680
So, let's see where
it goes on the board.

219
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,360
I'm imagining pretty high up.

220
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,560
Oh.

221
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,720
- That's not very fast.
- No, it isn't very fast.

222
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,000
But we put the Jag round, as well,

223
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,480
and that did it in...

224
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,800
Hang on, I've got the time here.
Just bear with me.

225
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,840
..one thirty-five one.

226
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,920
JAMES: So... slower than the Bugatti?

227
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,800
Yes.

228
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,240
Slower, in fact, than everything

229
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,800
except a small, cheap
Volkswagen hatchback,

230
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,120
which also went round
in the soaking wet.

231
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,600
Yes.

232
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,440
So, contrary to what
you were saying earlier on,

233
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,680
supercars have got much faster

234
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,600
over the last 25 years.

235
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,280
Yes.

236
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,760
Right! Moving on!

237
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,280
Because now it's time

238
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,600
to order some doughnuts of debate

239
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,640
from the Chat Café,
on Conversation Street.

240
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,680
(SMOOTH JAZZ)

241
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,480
- I was terrified.
- Yeah.

242
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,840
Right, good. Now...

243
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,080
- ..you know the BMW Z4?
- Yes.

244
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,200
The only car, incidentally,

245
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,160
designed on the interior
and the exterior by women.

246
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,280
- OK?
- It was.

247
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,240
Well, they're dropping it,
and replacing it with this.

248
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,080
This has been designed by a man, so...

249
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,240
Mm-hm. And where are you
going with this one, Jeremy?

250
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,520
So, it won't be able
to take its jumper off

251
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,360
by folding its arms.

252
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,720
- What?
- What are you on about?

253
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,760
Men can't take their jumpers
off like women do,

254
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,360
- crossing their arms.
- I can do that!

255
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,320
- You're not a man.
- Oh, right.

256
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,560
I take my jumper...

257
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,480
That's how you take
a jumper off, like that.

258
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,000
How do you know?

259
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,280
You just wait for the
paramedics to come along,

260
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,160
cut it off after your accident.

261
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,480
Yes, but that's how
you take a jumper off.

262
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,880
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Take your jumper off.

263
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,920
Just take your jumper off. Watch this.
How does he take it off?

264
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,360
Er, like this.

265
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,800
JEREMY: There, you see? Like a man.

266
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,320
Are there any women wanna take...

267
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,840
Oh, no, we can't do that.

268
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,200
Seriously, women, do you know
what I'm on about?

269
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,440
WOMEN: Yes.

270
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,560
Women cross...

271
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,200
If I tried to do that,
I'd dislocate my shoulder!

272
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,440
Thank you for that nonsense, Jeremy.

273
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,480
Can we maybe get back to
the BMW now, which is a car?

274
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,800
Yes, it is. Now, I have to say,

275
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,960
the old one was never as good to drive

276
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,640
- as it was to look at.
- I know what you mean.

277
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,360
It wasn't. It was sort of
baggy, wasn't it?

278
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah, and there was never an M version.

279
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,200
You know, it was all just unexciting.

280
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,920
But I'm hoping this new one

281
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,640
is as good to drive as it looks,

282
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,120
and it does look very good,

283
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,640
- even though it will struggle with its jumper.
- Yeah, whatever.

284
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,280
Anyway, if I was looking
for a new BMW Z4,

285
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,200
actually, I'd have one of these,

286
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,880
because this is the new Toyota Supra.

287
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,400
I know, it looks phenomenal!

288
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,000
And that underneath is basically a Z4.

289
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,960
- Same engine and everything.
- Same chassis.

290
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,640
It is a Z4, but with that body.

291
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,560
And that body,
I have to say, looks amazing.

292
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,240
And do you know
the most amazing thing is,

293
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,520
they're talking about a price
between 40,000 and 60,000,

294
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,560
which is much less than it looks like.

295
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,200
RICHARD: See, I think that is
actually filling a gap in the market.

296
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,200
There is a need right now
for a mid-price sportscar,

297
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,520
because there really
aren't many, if any.

298
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,160
There's the Audi TT RS.

299
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,960
Well, that'll definitely take its
jumper off like that, won't it?

300
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,720
And then stow it
in the overhead lockers,

301
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,720
tell you where the doors are.

302
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Now, Volkswagen's
US Head of Regulation -

303
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,800
that was his job title -
a guy called Oliver Schmidt.

304
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,520
He's just been done
for his part in Dieselgate.

305
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,480
And they've given him
seven years in jail.

306
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,680
Or, as he would put it, 4.2 years.

307
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,760
And a fine of £400,000,

308
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,920
or whatever that translates
into VW money.

309
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,640
Two hundred and seventy thousand.

310
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,080
The fascinating thing is, there was a
warrant out for his arrest in America,

311
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,400
but he was in Germany.

312
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,000
And then, for some reason,

313
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,320
he decided to take his
annual holiday in Florida,

314
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,800
and got arrested at the airport.

315
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,120
"Oh, nein!"

316
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,200
- Why did he do that?
- Because he's a moron?

317
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,520
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, he must be!

318
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,520
He must be!
The only thing I can think of

319
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,920
is that Volkswagen needed
someone to do some jail time

320
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,200
- for what had happened.
- And he volunteered to do it?

321
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,600
No, I reckon they probably said,

322
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,600
"You are ze employee
of ze month, Mr Schmidt,

323
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,800
and you have won a fortnight's holiday

324
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,280
in Disney World!"

325
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,680
- "Ah, danke!"
- And off he toddled.

326
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,040
"Oh, no, they have arrested me!"

327
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,520
That's actually a seven-year
holiday, Mr Schmidt,

328
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,880
and the catering is terrible.

329
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,760
Now, do you remember the Rimac we had

330
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,200
in programme one of this season?

331
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,440
- There it is.
- JEREMY: Yeah.

332
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,320
RICHARD: Well, they've announced
there is a new one coming out.

333
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,080
Well, what happened to that one?

334
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,680
No, that was called the Concept One.

335
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,960
- JEREMY: Mm-hm.
- And they only made eight of those, actually.

336
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,360
- How many are left?
- Seven. Shut up!

337
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,680
What happened to the other one, Hammond?

338
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,400
Just stop saying things!

339
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,360
The new one is gonna be
called the Concept Two,

340
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,200
and amazingly they're saying
it's gonna be even faster,

341
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,680
and that was blindingly fast.

342
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,760
I actually don't believe
that you can make a car go...

343
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,160
Well, they say it's gonna be faster,

344
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,360
and it's a bit bigger inside.

345
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,960
Which you did need, cos
that one was quite cramped.

346
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,960
- You can fit in this one.
- I could fit in the last one.

347
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,360
You'd be less like Spam, though,

348
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,080
if you rolled it over and over and over.

349
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,800
It should be more dangerous,
you're right.

350
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,480
We've actually got a picture
of the new Concept Two.

351
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,400
Here it is, Hammond. You'll like this.

352
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,920
- RICHARD: Oh, God. (LAUGHS)
- (LAUGHTER)

353
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,000
Ooh, now, there's a new McLaren, OK?

354
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,520
I've got a picture of it here.

355
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,400
This is staggering. OK?
I've got some of the details.

356
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,360
It's their new flagship,
kinda replaces the P1.

357
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,240
Super hard-core. 789 horsepower
mentalist that thing.

358
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,880
And they've called it... And this
is a tremendous name, I think.

359
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
- They've called it the Senna.
RICHARD: Ooh, cool.

360
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,000
JEREMY: I mean, that is a really
cool name for a car like that.

361
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,120
I'm glad they didn't
call it the Mansell.

362
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,640
- No, less cool.
- With its droning engine note.

363
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,480
And it would have a stupid
moustache above its number place.

364
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,560
- (DRONES)
- And if it were a convertible, a tweed roof.

365
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,280
McLaren Hunt could work,
cos he was quite cool.

366
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,920
A terrible thirst, though,
it would have.

367
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,240
Yeah, a lot of smoke coming out.

368
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,680
Every now and again it would try and
mount another car. But it'd be cool.

369
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,840
On balance, I think Senna's
probably the best name

370
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,200
they could have come up with.

371
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,080
Right. Now, what else? What
more conversation have we got?

372
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,280
- I have some conversation.
- You have some conversation?

373
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,960
You know last week,
you were talking about

374
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,440
how you ended up following a pigeon?

375
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,480
- How fast did you reckon it was going?
- Thirty-five?

376
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,720
Thirty-five, I think you said.

377
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,480
The other day, I was going
down a country lane

378
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,960
and I ended up following a blackbird,

379
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,920
and that only does 28.

380
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,920
And that's interesting, cos that
means a blackbird, in level flight,

381
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,240
is slower than a pigeon.

382
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,560
What is wrong with you two?

383
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,880
Why are you following birds?

384
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,920
Why not follow Russian spies
or straying husbands?

385
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,920
No, listen, Hammond. Pay attention.

386
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,760
- RICHARD: Oh, God.
- I did some research on this.

387
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,760
You know the top speed of a pigeon,

388
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,600
if it really puts its foot down, is 90,

389
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,880
in level flight.

390
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,400
- Ninety miles an hour!
- Ninety? That is amazing,

391
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,880
cos you wouldn't think a pigeon's
wings could shift enough air.

392
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,480
- No, I wouldn't think about it!
- No, no, stop!

393
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,960
You say that: a hummingbird
can fly faster than a goose.

394
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,880
- JAMES: Can it?
- Even though it's like that.

395
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,320
- Nobody cares!
- They do!

396
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,640
Stop ranking birds!

397
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,800
What?

398
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,280
- R-r-r-ranking.
- (LAUGHTER)

399
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,360
Anyway, I think that the top speed
of birds is a new hit show.

400
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,600
And you and I can host it,

401
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,280
and you'll end up as Buttons
in panto in Swindon.

402
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,640
And then you'll shoot yourself

403
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,480
in a room in a Premier Inn one night.

404
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,680
- Yeah.
- There'll only be one police car outside,

405
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,160
and it'll be a Vauxhall Astra.

406
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,360
That's your future!

407
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,080
Anyway, that is enough Conversation
Street this week, so let's move it on.

408
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,840
Thank you very much.

409
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,560
(CHEERING)

410
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,080
Now... Now, as I'm sure you know,

411
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,000
trying to set a speed record
is very, very dangerous,

412
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,520
and especially if you try
to do it on water.

413
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,640
In fact, over the years,
and this is a true fact,

414
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,520
85% of everyone

415
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,760
who's tried to break
a speed record on water

416
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,640
has been killed in the process.

417
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,840
- Eighty-five percent!
- Yeah.

418
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,320
But that's not the sort
of figure that puts us off!

419
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,560
Exactly. Because there was
a 15% chance of surviving it,

420
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,560
we decided to try and break
the UK speed record

421
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
for amphibious vehicles.

422
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,760
Yeah, first, though,
we had to build a car

423
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,600
that could be driven legally
on the road,

424
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,240
but that would also go
very quickly on the water.

425
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,160
Mm. And how hard can that be?

426
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,600
JEREMY: Since we were trying to break

427
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,760
an amphibious speed record,

428
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,120
the obvious starting point... was here.

429
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,680
At Huddersfield International Airport.

430
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,600
Why are we at Huddersfield
International Airport?

431
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeah, why aren't we at a lake?

432
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,960
Because I'm project leader,

433
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,600
and one of the many, many
things that I know

434
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,120
is that to go fast on water,

435
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,280
you have to have a lot of power.

436
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,080
To demonstrate what I was on about,

437
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,240
I'd set up a test,

438
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,800
using the jet engine from an RAF Nimrod.

439
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,080
- Did you build all this?
- Yes.

440
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,760
- JAMES: Can I just ask...
- JEREMY: What?

441
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,480
...what is the current speed
record for amphibious vehicles?

442
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,560
Thirty-nine point one miles an hour.

443
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,960
Well, isn't this rather overkill?

444
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,480
Listen, Usain Bolt can run
at 27mph on land, OK?

445
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,320
If he were waist-deep in water,

446
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,120
he'd have a top speed of about one.

447
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,080
Water's really sticky,
you need loads of power.

448
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,360
I've got a word in my head for all
this, and it's "impractical".

449
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,760
I've got a word, it's "shut up".

450
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,880
- All right.
- We're going.

451
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,120
(ENGINE POWERS UP)

452
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,760
- Is it loud?
- Very.

453
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,720
- (BANG)
- That's fired up.

454
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,720
That's gonna drive air
into the big engine.

455
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,480
- (ENGINE WHINES)
- We've gotta get those in the green.

456
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,480
I hate it when you've got buttons.

457
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,440
I can't hear anything.

458
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,400
Ignitors on.

459
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,840
(WHIRRING)

460
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,240
I'm gonna give it some thrust now.

461

(ENGINE WHINES)

462
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,120
Gonna go up to 100% power.

JAMES: You are a witless dodo!

468
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,080
RICHARD: Look at it!

469
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,120
JEREMY: Ah!

470
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,600
On the upside -
there is an upside here -

471
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,520
if it's capable of doing that,

472
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,560
imagine how fast
we're gonna go on the lake.

473
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,160
- You're a cretin.
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

474
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,720
None of this is based on any
scientific reasoning whatsoever.

475
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,240
You say, "It's got a lot of power."

476
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,720
"How much thrust has it got?" "A lot!"

477
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,560
Look what it's done,
it's blown two aeroplanes over

478
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,040
and given us a massive bill...

479
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,760
JEREMY: Having proved
to my sceptical colleagues

480
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,640
that jet power was the way forward,

481
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,120
we moved to our technology centre.

482
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,680
Here, we would fuse together
this Russian jet...

483
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,160
..this speedboat...

484
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,000
..and this Suzuki Jimny,

485
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,400
and we'd end up with the
fastest amphibious vehicle

486
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,200
Britain had ever seen.

487
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,280
- We have an old Suzuki car.
JEREMY: Yes.

488
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,200
A small, old, plastic boat
and a jet engine.

489
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,520
And you're suggesting that
somehow we unite them all

490
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,960
into some sort of symphony
of success and glory?

491
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yes.

492
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,200
This is the stupidest thing
I've ever been involved with.

493
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,560
JAMES: It's idiotic.

494
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,520
JEREMY: Having convinced my
sceptical colleagues once more

495
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,160
that my plan was a good one,
we set to work.

496
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,120
And soon, our amazing
creation was ready.

497
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,880
Right, as you can see, everyone,

498
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,760
this is fully road legal.

499
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,600
Lights, indicators, number plate.

500
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,560
And a massive jet engine just behind us.

501
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,720
JEREMY: Yes.

502
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,800
RICHARD: More of an issue, though,

503
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,240
was the passenger's seat layout.

504
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,360
I've gotta change gear,

505
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
and it's right where your penis is.

506
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,480
I never want your hand that
near my gentleman's sausage!

507
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,640
RICHARD: What are these things
above our heads exactly?

508
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,400
These are the stabilisation tanks, yeah?

509
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,160
When we go in the water, you lower
them down and they keep us afloat.

510
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,360
I've got that. I've got that
when we fitted them,

511
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,800
but what we're now discovering

512
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,840
is they make us more stable on water,

513
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,760
but a lot less on land!

514
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,560
JEREMY: James, why are
you being so quiet?

515
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,200
JAMES: I'm waiting for it to fall over.

516
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,320
JAMES AND RICHARD: Whoa!

517
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,400
Will you stop making
stupid, childish noises!

518
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,280
I think we've done an incredible job,

519
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,600
and I think I've been
a remarkable project leader.

520
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,600
Why has no-one
thought to do this before?

521
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,480
It's so logical when you look at it.

522
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,400
The car bit of it's working,
but it was already a car.

523
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,080
That's not much of an achievement.

524
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,280
I'm gonna do a brake test.

525
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,120
Ah! Oh! Oh.

526
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,360
- What?
- Wait.

527
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,480
(GASPS) Is that that...

528
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,680
- Ooh!
- Oh!

529
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,840
Yeah.

530
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,680
JEREMY: Eventually,
we arrived at the lake.

531
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,400
For our first high-speed test run.

532
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,240
And immediately, Hammond chickened out.

533
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,040
Why aren't you wearing a fire suit?

534
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,320
Um, jet engines just aren't my thing.

535
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,240
I'm gonna watch this from the bank.

536
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,720
Are you really not coming in it?

537
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,280
No, I'm gonna watch...
I'm gonna be the observer.

538
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,800
Oof!

539
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,680
JEREMY: Oh. She's ready.

540
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,080
My big fear is, let's be modest

541
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,560
and let's say we reached 80.

542
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,360
So from here, we've got to
just use drag to slow us down

543
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,600
before we hit the far bank.

544
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,240
Well, we have to think ahead, yes.

545
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,000
Start decelerating
when you pass that mid-point,

546
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,080
- you should be all right.
- JAMES: I think he's right.

547
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,480
The middle is the critical point.

548
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,160
RICHARD: Then just back off
the throttles.

549
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,960
- And then we'll use the drag of the pontoons to slow us down?
- Yeah.

550
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,560
OK.

551
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,920
Right.

552
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,160

were ready for the test,

553
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,000
and not at all nervous.

Perspex that I put in here,

555
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,680
I put it in.

556
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,000
So what if that just goes?

557
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,480
You shouldn't have said that.

is sucked into the engine?

560
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,120
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's like that.

561
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,480
It will be like that, won't it?

gonna fire up the jet engine.

Is that 50%?

Yeah, that's about 50, but 70 is 100.

589

What do you mean, "70 is 100"?

I couldn't find a dial that
exactly matched the revs,

I mean, that jet
is from a Russian fighter!

That is capable of keeping
a Russian fighter in the air.

Why doesn't it work?

625
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,320
Well, it's mainly to do with
the shape of the car,

626
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,800
the shape of the sawn-up bits
of tatty old boat

the size and power
and position of the engine,

00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,880
the amount of fuel it will run,

00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,240
the basic physics.

632
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,240
The fact that water is
750 times as dense as air...

633
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,400
JAMES: It was time to go back
to the drawing board.

634
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,280
And this time, we gave Jeremy
a job he could actually do.

635
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,760
Now, this is the car that
currently holds the record

636
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,560
for amphibious vehicles.

637
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,520
It's the Gibbs Humdinga,

638
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,080
and, as you can see,
it is not an ancient Suzuki

639
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,200
with an old Russian
jet engine on the back.

640
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,080
No, it's a light, plastic car
with a hull,

641
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,240
and, as you can see, retractable wheels.

642
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,840
Exactly. And that's why we have chosen,

643
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,360
as the basis for our project, this.

644
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,480
Which is a Reliant Robin

00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,480
one of the coolest cars from the '70s.

647
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,080
And I can see why you chose
this particular one, Hammond.

648
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,560
It's got your name on it.

649
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,520
Shut up. The only reason these
things never really caught on

650
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,640
was because nobody thought
of making them amphibious.

651
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,000
Yes, but we have, you see.

652
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,560
So we're gonna fit it with retractable
wheels, same as the Gibbs,

653
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,680
and we're gonna use the
engine from one of these.

654
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,080
- JEREMY: A jet engine.
- Yes. Sort of, but different.

655
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,200
JEREMY: It's my idea.

656
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,000
The jet engine was not your idea.

657
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,720
No, the jet engine isn't my idea,

658
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,440
but the idea of making an amphibious car

659
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,400
using a jet engine was my idea.

660
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,880
This is a water jet, it's different.

661
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,600
And anyway, this is genius,

662
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,560
because you can rent one of these

663
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,040
from pretty much any beach in the world,

664
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,960
that will do 50mph out of the box.

665
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
- This one will do 67.
- It will. Exactly.

666
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,040
Well, that's plenty.

667
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,840
So, all we've gotta do
is incorporate this

668
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,120
into the roadworthy shell
of the Bond Bug,

669
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,600
and we've got a very fast car and a
very fast boat in the same thing.

670
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,480
Which is exactly what I was doing.

671
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,440

we sent Jeremy home

00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,080
You both started with 4x4s,
as far as I can work out,

694
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,560
or they have featured in your life.

695
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,320
You are a G-Wagen man, yeah?

696
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,480
Yeah, yeah.

697
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,040
So, at the beginning, when my
TV show got a bit of success,

698
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,720
Mercedes came and they
would give me cars to drive.

699
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,000
But then, I did a commercial with Fiat,

700
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,720
and Mercedes weren't
too happy about that.

701
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,600
(LAUGHTER)

702
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,520
I used some of the money from Fiat to...

703
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,480
I still love the G-Wagen,
so I bought one.

704
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,440
So, you used Fiat money
to buy a Mercedes?

705
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Yeah.

706
00:35:02,536 --> 00:35:04,760
That is quite good. But
you had a Ford Bronco.

707
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,240
But only because I watched OJ do the...

708
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,200
- (LAUGHTER)
- And I said, "He's kind of a big guy.

709
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,480
Maybe I'd fit in that car."

710
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,160
And I got the whole thing,
and it was all too masculine,

711
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,440
so I painted it stripper pink for Vegas.

712
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,720
When you're driving to work, do
they think you're a stripper?

713
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,880
I hope so.

714
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,040
Didn't you have a Ford Falcon
at some stage?

715
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,880
Well, when I was in high school...

716
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,680
I'm from a rural area.

717
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,280
..my mother gave me her car,
which was a Ford Falcon.

718
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,360
But for me, that was just a place
to have sex in high school.

719
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,600
And then you started touring together.

720
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
Mm-hm.

721
00:35:41,726 --> 00:35:43,640
So you presumably needed
some kind of tour...

722
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,880
You know, we're carny trash.

723
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,280
We did carnivals and outdoor
shows and all of that.

724
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,080
We're the worst kind of people.

725
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,880
And we had to drive all over
the United States of America.

726
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,360
So, we went to an auction place

727
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,160
and bought a Datsun 210 station wagon,

728
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,960
with the back seat down, and then our
trunks in there with all our stuff.

729
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,960
We were so terrified
of having our props stolen,

730
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,520
that we had a magnetic sign
we put on the side

731
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,880
that said, "Atlanta Centre
for Disease Control

732
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,840
Specimen Transfer Unit."

733
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,720
We put that on the side, with
the big boxes in the back,

734
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,200
and that worked really well,

735
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,200
until the sign was stolen.

736
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,080
I wanna talk about cars,

737
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,240
but who would rather here
see some magic?

738
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,880
AUDIENCE: Yes!

739
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,440
I know we're supposed to do cars.

740
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,840
Would you mind awfully
if you now do some?

741
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,880
Have you actually... You've
brought something with you?

742
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,240
I'm gonna try something with you.

743
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,040
Just hold your hands out for me.

744
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,400
- What, both?
- Both, like this.

745
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,880
- Like that?
- A little bit wider.

746
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,480
Are you left or right-handed?

747
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,840
Right-handed. Unless
we're talking about shooting.

748
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,640
- Close it in a fist.
- Like that? That one?

749
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,440
Yeah, then turn this left one over.

750
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,960
I'm gonna put a little cross
right there.

751
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,440
Can you show that to everyone?

752
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,640
- Show the cross to everybody.
- I've got a cross there.

753
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,960
Let's have a look.

754
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,760
So, make sure it's dry.

755
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,360
It's Sharpie, so it shouldn't come off.

756
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,520
Yeah, it's still there.

757
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,760
The idea...

758
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,840
..is to make it...

759
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,800
..disappear from there...

760
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,560
If it's in this hand now,
I'm going to be...

761
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,600
(BLEEP) sake!

762
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,640
How is that?

763
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,320
Go on, do another one. Who'd
like to see another one?

764
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,640
AUDIENCE: Yes!

765
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,320
- Come on, what have you got?
- Have you got a piece of paper there?

766
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,000
Er, yes.

767
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,720
I've got a pen here.

768
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,200
I'm just gonna just do
some markings for you.

769
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,320
We'll start here.

770
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,480
Take the pen.

771
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,920
- Take the pen.
- Yeah.

772
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,880
Give me a number from, say, one to ten.

773
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,120
Nine.

774
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,560
Nine. Write it down.

775
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,840
- JEREMY: Nine.
- DYNAMO: Great.

776
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,600
We'll go for, let's see,

777
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,360
the lady right there with the glasses.

778
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,160
Yeah. I need another number,
from 9 to 19.

779
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,880
Er, 11.

780
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,240
- Eleven.
- I think it was a man.

781
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,960
That's a bit embarrassing.

782
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,800
We may be in a world of trouble here.

783
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,720
(APPLAUSE)

784
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,080
Let's move it on, quickly!

785
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,200
Yes.

786
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,880
- Richard!
- Yes?

787
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,360
A number from 11 to 21.

788
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,840
Nineteen.

789
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

790
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,560
- Nineteen, write it down.
- There, yeah?

791
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,800
Perfect. Yes.

792
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,120
Uh, we'll go for this guy
here in the blue jacket.

793
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,920
- How you doing?
- Actually, that's a woman.

794
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,520
- (APPLAUSE)
- It's so hard to tell.

795
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,840
A number from 19 to 29, please.

796
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,520
27.

797
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,960
Twenty-seven, write that down.

798
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,360
Gilles Villeneuve's old number.

799
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,080
We'll go for this gentleman right
here with a white t-shirt.

800
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,760
- The gender-fluid gentleman.
- Yes. Yes!

801
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,480
DYNAMO: A number from 27 to 37.

802
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,680
Thirty-three.

803
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,000
Thirty-three, write that down.

804
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,480
Finally, the lady at the end
with the long hair.

805
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,680
Can we have a number between 33 and 49?

806
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,840
- Forty-two.
- DYNAMO: Forty-two.

807
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,720
So, nine, 11, 19, 27, 33 and 42.

808
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,640
These are the numbers
we randomly generated today.

809
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,200
A couple of years ago,

810
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,320
I picked six numbers myself.

811
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,680
They're like my lucky numbers,

812
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,200
and I went to a shop and
I bought a lottery ticket.

813
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,520
And I won.

814
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,600
Only a tenner, but, you know,
I won something.

815
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,080
And I actually keep
that ticket in my wallet.

816
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,520
- There we go.
- No, no, no. No!

817
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,920
Keep it in my wallet for good luck.

818
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,200
Where's the camera?

819
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,640
Can you see that?

820
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,920
There's one ticket there.

821
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,680
- This is a lottery ticket?
- I think you'll find the numbers quite interesting,

822
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,240
if you wanna read them out loud.

823
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,680
So, you...

824
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,640
I'll need my glasses
on a lottery ticket.

825
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,800
So, let's just...

826
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,600
- What was the first number?
- Nine.

827
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,760
Nine, right there.

828
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,920
- Eleven.
- Eleven.

829
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,560
- Nineteen.
- Nineteen for Richard.

830
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,360
- JEREMY: Twenty-seven.
- DYNAMO: Twenty-seven.

831
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,160
- JEREMY: Thirty-three.
- DYNAMO: Thirty-three.

832
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,800
- DYNAMO: The last one?
- JEREMY: Forty-two.

833
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,480
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

834
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,080
That's actually a lottery
ticket. It is a lott...

835
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,320
I'm... Well, I'm staggered.

836
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,600
But anyway, look,
we haven't finished yet.

837
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,120
Shall we see what the Americans can do?

838
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,920
- AUDIENCE: Yes!
- Come on, you two, let's have a look. What have you got?

839
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,640
Well, you know, I was asking Dynamo,

840
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,360
you're a member
of the Magic Circle, right?

841
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,600
- Yeah.
- PENN: We are not.

842
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,280
Teller and I have a reputation,

843
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,560
not ill-deserved, for
giving away magic secrets.

844
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,200
You do. You always say
how your tricks work.

845
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,520
We have done that, so they
will not let us be members.

846
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,680
So that got us thinking.

847
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,280
Could we do a trick that
would fool the Magic Circle,

848
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,920
while giving away...

849
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,920
..all the very principles
we've given away?

850
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,840
And the first thing we gave
away, in 1985, way back then,

851
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,600
we're on the David Letterman programme,

852
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,440
and gave away the idea
of fake blindfolds

853
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,920
that are used by magicians.

854
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,480
We said, "Every blindfold used by a
magician is fake," which we've stood by.

855
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,880
We're gonna have a blindfold that
can't be faked, which is... Dynamo.

856
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,160
Teller's gonna stand up here,

857
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,280
and, Dynamo, just make sure
that Teller can't see.

858
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,480
Come over there and
just make sure that Teller...

859
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,560
- Not permanently, but just for now.
- (LAUGHTER)

860
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,840
Just put your hands right over
his eyes there so he can't see.

861
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,480
No need to be gentle, it's not me.

862
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,280
- Cool, cool.
- All you've gotta do is make sure he can't see.

863
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,640
How many fingers am I holding up?

864
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,080
Now, we've been accused

865
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,880
of giving away the idea of marked cards.

866
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,480
Marked cards are very hard to...

867
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,160
Even professional gamblers

868
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,600
sometimes can't determine
if they're marked.

869
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,360
But Dynamo's gonna
make sure they're not marked.

870
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,000
The cards will be dealt face-down
in Teller's right hand.

871
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,040
If the cards were marked,
which they're not,

872
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,160
Teller would have to see,

873
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,920
and Dynamo's making sure he can't see.

874
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,760
- He can't see.
- The other thing we gave away

875
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,000
was on the Johnny Carson programme.

876
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,520
We gave away the idea of a card force:

877
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,360
that it's easy to do a trick

878
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,400
if you know in advance
what card's gonna be picked.

879
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,360
And one of the ways you can
do a force like that, Jeremy,

880
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,680
is to have all the cards be the same.

881
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,040
- JEREMY: Yeah.
- Then just have a card selected,

882
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,800
where you know what's it's gonna be.

883
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,200
- Stand up for a second, Jeremy.
- Yeah, I can become vertical.

884
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,280
I want you to make sure
you look over these,

885
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,200
and make sure they are not all the same.

886
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,360
- I'll try to fan them all out.
- No, that's a pack of cards.

887
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,520
Yeah, it's a pack of cards.

888
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,360
Now, another way you can do a card force

889
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,800
is you can use sleight of hand

890
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,680
to force the bottom card
or the top card,

891
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,080
or even a card in the middle.

892
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,120
I'm gonna eliminate sleight
of hand by using your hands.

893
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,160
OK?

894
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,280
So, I'm gonna give you
most of the deck right there.

895
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,480
And I'm gonna...

896
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,160
Just fan them out like this.
Fan them out.

897
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,360
Don't let me see, but just think of one.

898
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,560
Don't even point to it, don't cut to it.

899
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,640
Just look over all the cards.
You have most of the deck.

900
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,560
And then just think of one card.

901
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,880
Don't look at it, just think of it.

902
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,720
Then close them up so I can't
see what you're doing.

903
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,640
And then give those cards
a good shuffle.

904
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,280
Or give them that kind of shuffle.

905
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,560
Good. That's good.

906
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,920
But face-down so I can't tell
what you're shuffling.

907
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,680
- So you've thought of one card?
- Mm-hm.

908
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,040
- You have no idea where it is in the deck? Is that right?
- No. No.

909
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,320
Now, magicians often
want you to misremember

910
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,680
the sequence of events.

911
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,800
We want you to very much
remember the sequence.

912
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,920
The card is only
in your head, is that right?

913
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,320
- Yeah.
- It's nowhere else?

914
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,200
- Nowhere else.
- The cards are all mixed up, you have no idea where it is.

915
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,920
Now, I'm gonna put these in your hand.

916
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,200
Now, the order of these will
not change. It will not change.

917
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,400
I'm not gonna touch them again.

918
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,680
I will no touch them again, OK?

919
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,120
Now that my hands are off,
and I won't touch them again,

920
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,320
what was the name of the card?

921
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,440
- King of Hearts.
- OK.

922
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,520
Now, you're gonna go over there and you're
gonna deal the cards, one at a time,

923
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,000
from the top, face-down,
to Teller's right hand, OK?

924
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,760
- Into his hand?
- Into his right hand.

925
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,120
- JEREMY: Face-down?
- PENN: Yeah.

926
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,600
PENN: Dynamo, make sure he can't see.

927
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,760
He can't see nothing.

928
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,880
See, we are just being
whipping boys again, Dynamo,

929
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,720
us English.

930
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,800
- OK, Dynamo, was he able to see, even for a moment?
- Nothing.

931
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,960
- Jeremy, what was the name of your card?
- King of Hearts.

932
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,240
Look at the next card.

933
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,600
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- Thought of card out of a shuffled deck.

934
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,160
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

935
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,600
JEREMY: Well...

936
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,200
You came here, of course,
to do your laps.

937
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,560
And, as we can see,
in the rapidly fading light,

938
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,280
the weather has not been clement.

939
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,640
In fact, when we arrived
at the track this morning,

940
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,000
it looked like this.

941
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,000
And then... You can see the problem.

942
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,280
That bit, you can sort of see
where the track goes.

943
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,440
But if we've got another shot...
I think we've got a moving shot.

944
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,160
Now, somewhere in there is a racetrack.

945
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,360
(LAUGHTER)

946
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,560
Which makes it quite tricky,
I should imagine,

947
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,680
to see where you were going.

948
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,960
- You did it first, didn't you?
- Yeah.

949
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,760
And there was a particularly fine
moment, I have to say, on the...

950
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,720
It's supposed to be a flat-out
corner when it's dry,

951
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,240
but it really wasn't.

952
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,200
The weather was improving,
it was thawing.

953
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,000
And it all went, really,
brilliantly wrong.

954
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,520
Who'd like to see Dynamo
going round in a few circles?

955
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,120
- Yeah, we all wanna see that?
AUDIENCE: Yes!

956
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,320
Let's have a look at this.

957
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,680
This is a flat-out corner,

958
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,720
and then you just can see it's going,

959
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,920
and then...

960
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,040
That's a properly big
slide-off, that one is.

961
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,400
Round of applause for that, though.

962
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,960
We like that.

963
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,960
- Was that scary?
- No, it was well fun!

964
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,840
I was like, "I could have
done this all day,

965
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,000
it's so much fun."

966
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,480
Who'd like to see the lap
that eventually resulted?

967
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,520
- AUDIENCE: Yes!
- Let's have a look.

968
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,000
Dynamo's lap, here it comes.

969
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,520
Thawed out.

970
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,320
A nice, smooth, quiet start.
And he's away.

971
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,280
Right, let's do this!

972
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,680
JEREMY: OK, that's...

973
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,080
Ooh, that's quick through...

974
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,160
Oh! Yes, that's cutting
that corner, but nicely done.

975
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,560
Nicely held.

976
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,280
And now we go on to what
is normally gravel, but...

977
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,040
What does it look like now?
It's just mud and slush.

978
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,320
God, that looks tricky!

979
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,640
But you're keeping it...

980
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,440
Ooh, a bit wide through
there, but not bad at all.

981
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,720
Again, not bad.

982
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,480
Not fast, but...

983
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,800
I don't think I'm on
the track any more, guys.

984
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,200
JEREMY: No, it's still brown...

985
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,680
No, that is a James May cornering
speed through that one.

986
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,480
Is the car putting
traction down all right?

987
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,560
DYNAMO: No, it was all over the place!

988
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,920
JEREMY: No, that's nice.

989
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,920
Yeah, splashing through the last bit.

990
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,440
Difficult Bit 2 as we call it.

991
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,760
It's driving on water, this is.

992
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,080
JEREMY: It is, yeah.
It's almost Jesus-esque.

993
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,800
And then now we get
back onto the tarmac.

994
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,480
Ooh, I say, that was tonnes
of front-end grip there

995
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,160
all of a sudden.

996
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,760
And look at the way
the front's turning in.

997
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,080
That's unbelievable!

998
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,600
Now, we go onto the
really fast bit, ordinarily.

999
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,040
Come on, then. Here we go.

1000
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,200
JEREMY: This is where
you lost it in the practice.

1001
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,680
But you haven't lost it this time.

1002
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,480
That front is suddenly
sticking really well!

1003
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,760
Coming up to the last corner.

1004
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,120
And a little bit of understeer
through there, but nicely tamed.

1005
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,360
And there we are,
across the line, everybody!

1006
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,000
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1007
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,520
Nicely done. Not easy.

1008
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,360
Not easy.

1009
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,240
Now then, after you'd had
a go, it was your turn.

1010
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,000
- Yes.
- Did you enjoy yourself?

1011
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,160
I had a very good time, yeah. And I had
Teller as a passenger, which was helpful.

1012
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,720
Oh, that would help!
Balance it out nicely.

1013
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,080
PENN: Sure.

1014
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,680
You also had a moment, shall we say.

1015
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,360
I did. I did, yeah.

1016
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,840
Would anybody like to see this moment?

1017
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,640
- AUDIENCE: Yes!
- Let's have a look.

1018
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,600
This is quick
coming into the last corner.

1019
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,800
That's understeer.

1020
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,640
Oh, somebody's been off there already,

1021
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,320
you can see the tyre marks,
but not as far you went.

1022
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,680
That is impressive.

1023
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,040
That's the furthest anybody's
been off that track,

1024
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,080
by a long way.

1025
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,360
You're definitely winning that, so far.
Definitely.

1026
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,720
Furthest off the track, I got that.

1027
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,200
- But then you got a lap together, both of you.
- I did.

1028
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,360
Let's have a look at this lap.

1029
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,600
Yeah, another nice, tidy start.

1030
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,400
Roaring off down to the first corner.

1031
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,920
So, we're going, Teller.
Can you feel that?

1032
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,960
JEREMY: It's not at all scary in there.

1033
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,720
Right, that's tidily done through there,

1034
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,120
keeping it really on the island,

1035
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,360
unlike Dynamo, who was a bit mad.

1036
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,000
And onto the gravel.

1037
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,400
Well, the mud. Well, the slush.

1038
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,760
Whatever you wanna call it.

1039
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,200
(RATTLING)

1040
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,560
Ahhh!

1041
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,160
PENN: I'm going quickly there.

1042
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,520
JEREMY: Oh-hoo-hoo!

1043
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,640
- That was well held there.
PENN: Thank you.

1044
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,280
JEREMY: That's nice driving.

1045
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,200
I'm under control.
Shut up, Teller! I got it!

1046
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,680
JEREMY: Is he putting you off?

1047
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,800
Now, this is...

1048
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,160
Sometimes, when it appears
to be slow, it's fast,

1049
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,560
and sometimes, when
it looks fast, it's slow.

1050
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,280
This is looking fast,
I'm gonna be honest,

1051
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,840
but there's a lot of sideways action,

1052
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,280
which, of course, isn't forward motion,

1053
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,080
- which is a problem.
- But it looks really good.

1054
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,480
JEREMY: It looks tremendous.
This is great television.

1055
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,480
And you can hear the bark
of the two-litre there

1056
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,720
as you hit the straight.

1057
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,120
- We're going!
- Ahh!

1058
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,280
- Now! Boom!
- Oh!

1059
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,480
JEREMY: And coming up to the...

1060
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,880
This is the corner - not
this one, but the next one,

1061
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,920
that caught you out practising.

1062
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,160
Ooh, you're trying to get
a Scandi flick going there,

1063
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,520
but a bit too soon.

1064
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,640
Understeer again,

1065
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,240
but you've held it this time.

1066
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,320
And there we are, yeah,
across the line, everybody!

1067
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,880
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1068
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,680
Right, I have the times here.

1069
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,800
OK.

1070
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,560
We'll start with you, Dynamo.

1071
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,560
One thirty-nine point three.

1072
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,000
- That's all right.
- That's really slow.

1073
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,880
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1074
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,480
But you've got the snow symbol.

1075
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,640
So far, you're the fastest person ever

1076
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,680
to go round our track in the snow.

1077
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,600
But are you faster than Penn and Teller?

1078
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,880
There's actually
excitement here, isn't there?

1079
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,600
- DYNAMO: Yeah.
- PENN: There's nervousness.

1080
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,120
You did it in one...

1081
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,640
..thirty...

1082
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,360
..three point eight.

1083
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,480
(APPLAUSE)

1084
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,640
(CHEERING)

1085
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,880
DYNAMO: Bad boy.

1086
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,240
Commiserations. Commiserations.

1087
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,360
Congratulations, gentlemen.
Congratulations.

1088
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,800
That was fantastic!

1089
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,440
And thank you so much, all of you,

1090
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,440
for coming along
and doing all this magic.

1091
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,520
But we must now say goodbye to Dynamo

1092
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:12,080
and the world's fastest
magicians, Penn and Teller!

1093
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,800
- World's fastest magicians!
- (CHEERING)

1094
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,800
Now, tonight, we are attempting to break

1095
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,160
the British water speed
record for amphibious cars.

1096
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,760
Now, earlier on, Jeremy
had a go at making something,

1097
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,400
and his effort was, frankly, terrible.

1098
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,720
- JEREMY: No, it wasn't.
- It was.

1099
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,400
Yeah, so, Hammond and I
took control of the project,

1100
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:40,040
and what we decided to do was
take a 1970s three-wheeler

1101
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,080
with a removable roof,
called a Bond Bug...

1102
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,200
Here's a picture of it.

1103
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,600
..and mate that with a jet ski,

1104
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,200
to create something that we
had christened the Pond Bug.

1105
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,080
And then, when it was finished,

1106
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,560
take it to the Lake District,

1107
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,680
and something called
Coniston Speed Week.

1108
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,880
JAMES: Over the decades,
many fearless daredevils

1109
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,240
have powered across this
five-mile stretch of water,

1110
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,920
in the pursuit of new records.

1111
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,240
One was the legendary Donald Campbell.

1112
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,720
Who was killed here in 1967,

1113
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,800
whilst trying to break
the 300mph barrier.

1114
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,560
Today, in Speed Week, that
spirit of adventure lives on,

1115
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,520
as people from all over the world

1116
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,080
come to push their boats, their engines,

1117
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,080
and themselves to the absolute limit.

1118
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,240
This was speed heaven,

1119
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,880
and I felt sure
our fully road legal Pond Bug

1120
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,040
would blend in perfectly.

1121
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,560
Morning!

1122
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,560
Look at all this!

1123
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,760
Having parked up, I went off
to find Hammond and Clarkson,

1124
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,000
who reckoned he'd come up
with something better.

1125
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,560
- JEREMY: Are you ready?
- (SIGHS)

1126
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,600
You're gonna not believe this.

1127
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,800
RICHARD: OK.

1128
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,520
JEREMY: Behold my genius!

1129
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,160
JAMES: Oh, hello!

1130
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,280
JEREMY: Oh, yeah!

1131
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,920
RICHARD: That is actually
quite surprising.

1132
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,760
JEREMY: So, the tracks drop
down when you're near land.

1133
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,960
JAMES: Oh, very clever!

1134
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,560
I mean, I'm sorry...

1135
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,240
I'm gonna stand back a little bit.

1136
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:08,280
..have I, or have I not
created something brilliant?

1137
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,280
- JAMES: No.
- RICHARD: You didn't build it.

1138
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,120
And it's very cool,
but you can't use it.

1139
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,200
- Why not?
- Because it's not road legal!

1140
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,520
Well, put a number plate on it.

1141
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,800
It's not an amphibious car, it's a boat.

1142
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,480
That's a boat with legs on it.

1143
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,760
It's not eligible for what we're doing.

1144
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,000
- Well, where's your car?
- BOTH: Ah!

1145
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,280
- What do you think?
- Oh, yeah!

1146
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,880
Look at it!

1147
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,040
That is a quality job.

1148
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,840
Why are you pulling that face?

1149
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,040
It's the stupidest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

1150
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,200
It's the coolest thing
that has ever been!

1151
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,240
- Look at it!
- What are they?

1152
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,400
- RICHARD: These are the doors.
- JAMES: Yes, undercarriage doors.

1153
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,520
What doors?

1154
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,800
RICHARD: You retract the undercarriage.

1155
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,840
The front wheel goes up,
then these doors shut,

1156
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,000
you've got a smooth hull.

1157
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,760
So those... What do the back wheels do?

1158
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,480
(WHISTLES)

1159
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,680
What about the chine?

1160
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,480
What do you mean,
"What about the chine"?

1161
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,000
Look at the chine at the back.

1162
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,800
This is to attempt a water speed record.

1163
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:08,560
- RICHARD: I know!
- JEREMY: This is what you need for a high-speed run,

1164
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,800
a smooth, rounded chine.

1165
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:14,120
When this is up here, it's sharp.

1166
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,760
So, as you're going along,
you catch that,

1167
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,480
and it's gonna go.

1168
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,640
JAMES: We had to make it fit round the wheel,
otherwise it wouldn't work on the road.

1169
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,920
You could have made it round!

1170
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,880
That was a difficult fabrication job.
It was much easier to do it like that.

1171
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,000
I'm sure it's easier, but
you've created a death trap!

1172
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,640
Weight. Keep the nose down.

1173
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,640
- JEREMY: I know what it's for.
- RICHARD: Well, there you go then.

1174
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,360
Isn't this thing just gonna porpoise?

1175
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,400
- We don't know.
- No. Probably.

1176
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,920
JEREMY: Anyone who gets in that

1177
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,440
- is effectively committing suicide.
- JAMES: No, they're not!

1178
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,160
Anyone who gets in that is gonna look the
coolest person here, that's fact one.

1179
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,440
Which one of you two's driving it?

1180
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,800
Now, that's interesting, because...

1181
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,040
We've had a think about that.
It's gotta be somebody

1182
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,840
with a speedboat,
powerboat racing licence.

1183
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,880
- JAMES: Yes. Have you got one of those?
- I haven't got one.

1184
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,640
I haven't got one. Do I know
anybody who does have one?

1185
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,960
Yes, I do have a racing licence.

1186
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,440
- Well, there you go, then.
- And here is your racing boat.

1187
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,360
Look what we've built for you.

1188
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,040
- I am not getting in that.
- Yes, you are.

1189
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,440
No, I'm not doing...

1190
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,640
- No!
- JAMES: Well, you have to.

1191
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,800
- You have to.
- I am not.

1192
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,160
And with that, back to the tent.

1193
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,920
- This is broken.
- No, line it up with the...

1194
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,520
It is broken, otherwise it would...

1195
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,040
You've used a removable
steering wheel before.

1196
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,360
JAMES: Line up the... There you go!

1197
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,600
I've mended it.

1198
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,760
JEREMY: Knowing that 85% of people

1199
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,120
who attempt speed records are killed,

1200
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,720
and that the boat had been
designed by imbeciles,

1201
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,280
I was fervently hoping that it
would, at least, be easy to operate.

1202
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,280
However...

1203
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,640
You have to drive it into the water
first. It's still in road mode.

1204
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,360
And you do that using this.
That just teases it in.

1205
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,160
A little push, a little push,
and it goes in.

1206
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,600
Once you're in the water, you
have to retract the wheels,

1207
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,960
and then you disengage
the fan and the clutch.

1208
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,920
Then you have to close
the nose wheel doors...

1209
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,080
If you push it down once,
you're in neutral.

1210
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,600
You'll still rotate round, cos
the jet's still running...

1211
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,560
Push it up, you'll see the current
will flow on the ammeter.

1212
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,920
When you get a current surge...

1213
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,160
Jet thrust trim is here,

1214
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,800
and it will appear
on your screen here...

1215
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,280
Hold that, and that goes...

1216
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,520
This one, you pull it fully back.

1217
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,720
If you knew, and you
obviously did know all along,

1218
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,400
that I was gonna be driving this,

1219
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,280
why have you made this thing
so complicated?

1220
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,320
- That's not complicated.
- We've simplified it.

1221
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,200
These instruments are from the jet ski.

1222
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,000
RICHARD: Comforting.

1223
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,800
Comforting. When you're on holiday,

1224
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,160
you've looked at those and thought,

1225
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,440
"I'm having a lovely time."

1226
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,400
That's what you're doing today.
The water will be colder.

1227
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,640
- Why don't you take the checklist with you?
- Because it will blow...

1228
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,040
- It tells you the things you've got to do.
- JAMES: It's so easy!

1229
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,760
We've spent hours on that!

1230
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,560
The thing to remember is that it's...

1231
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,320
Thirty-nine miles an hour
is really fast.

1232
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,080
- JAMES: It is quite fast.
- It is really fast.

1233
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,840
But if you do 40, then
you're a world record holder.

1234
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,480
- Step out of here...
- JEREMY: Not world. It's a British record.

1235
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,600
- What better record to break?
- What other sort of record would you want?

1236
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,520
JEREMY: To set a speed record,

1237
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,560
you have to drive past the
start line marker buoys.

1238
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,960
You're then timed over a kilometre,

1239
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,640
after which, you turn round...

1240
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,320
..and do exactly the same thing

1241
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,040
in the opposite direction.

1242
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,120
Your result is an average speed
taken from the two runs.

1243
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,960
It all sounded very terrifying.

1244
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,240
Please sink like a stone. Please sink!

1245
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,160
Sink! Sink!

1246
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,160
No, it isn't. Damn it!

1247
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,000
- It looks good.
- It looks brilliant!

1248
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,720
RICHARD (OVER RADIO):
We have every faith in you.

1249
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,360
- We don't have every faith.
- No.

1250
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,600
No faith.

1251
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,760
JAMES: Wheels!

1252
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,120
Wheels coming up.

1253
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,280
JEREMY: It was now time
for the checklist.

1254
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,680
What do I do with the clutch?
I've forgotten that.

1255
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,840
Doors. Doors. Is that right?

1256
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,400
How do I get it out...
Wait a minute. Right, bilge.

1257
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,800
No, that's bilge, that's not right.

1258
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,080
No, it's just...

1259
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,720
Oh, this is terrible!

1260
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,800
Hammond! May! You idiots!

1261
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,720
JAMES: Why is he just
going round and round?

1262
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,560
Is there a record
for going round and round?

1263
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,840
RICHARD: Don't know, but if
there is, it's in the bag.

1264
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,360
Right. I think we need to go to a
better viewing position to see his run.

1265
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,200
Let's go over there.

1266
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,520
JEREMY: With the ridiculous
checklist completed,

1267
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,240
I had to get some speed up,

1268
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,240
so I could cross
the start line at full chat.

1269
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,600
(ENGINE REVS)

1270
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,320
Visor down.

1271
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,880
It's on the plain now.
We're on the plain.

1272
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,760
It's very spray-y.

1273
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,640
It's a badly-designed hull.

1274
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,320
JEREMY: But the hull
was the least of my problems.

1275
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,320
Jesus Christ! This steering!

1276
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,440
Oh...

1277
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,880
It's a (BLEEP) nightmare!

1278
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,160
I can't steer it!

1279
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,160
I literally cannot steer it!

1280
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,080
I think he's experimenting with it.

1281
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,200
I think he's sort of testing.

1282
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,520
Oh, my God!

1283
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,400
(GROANS)

1284
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,560
- JAMES: It looks pretty good.
- RICHARD: It looks fabulous!

1285
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,040
I bet it handles like a dream!

1286
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,480
Oh, come on!

1287
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,280
I'm gonna crash
into the bloody safety boat!

1288
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,760
- Look, he's making turns. Yes!
- That looks tremendous!

1289
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,400
JEREMY: Three times
I tried to get the Pond Bug

1290
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,400
pointing in the right direction.

1291
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,520
Absolutely impossible!

1292
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,160
And then I thought, "Sod it,"
put my foot down,

1293
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,920
and went for it.

1294
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,160
Oh, Christ!

1295
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,560
It's only my skill that is keeping
this pointing in a straight line.

1296
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,320
And, to make matters worse
for a man on a speed run,

1297
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:07,160
I had no idea how fast I was going.

1298
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,720
I've got a GPS speedo,
but I can't read it,

1299
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,120
because there isn't any GPS.

1300
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,480
Why have they given me
such shoddy workmanship?

1301
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,360
Oh, heavens!

1302
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,560
Oh, Christ!

1303
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,520
That's the worst thing
I've ever done, ever.

1304
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,640
And now, I've gotta
turn round and do it again.

1305
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,160
I've gotta wait
for my own wash to die down.

1306
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,080
That's what did for Campbell.
He went back too quickly.

1307
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,480
Here we go.

1308
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,480
That is my foot pinned to the floor!

1309
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,960
Jesus! It's starting to chain lock!

1310
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,560
It's really bad.

1311
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,760
Ahhh!

1312
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,520
And then...

1313
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,800
Oh, my God!

1314
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,760
Oh, no, we've got a power problem!

1315
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,440
I'm losing power!

1316
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,440
May and Hammond have built
a piece of shit here.

1317
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:22,280
It sounds a little bit inconsistent.

1318
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,400
That's maybe him
feathering the throttle.

1319
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,160
He is possibly finessing it
to keep it on the plain.

1320
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,520
Oh, no! Come on!

1321
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,360
(SIGHS)

1322
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,120
Jesus! A lot of smoke.

1323
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,800
Well, that was a disaster!

1324
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:47,120
I've got no GPS, so I don't
know how fast that was.

1325
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,120
And the engine
is cutting out all the time.

1326
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,360
Basically, it was time for a stern word

1327
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,440
with the engineering department.

1328
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,280
- Right, you two...
- RICHARD: Yeah?

1329
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,560
Not only have you built something

1330
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,120
- ugly and complicated...
- It's not...

1331
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,040
JEREMY: No, it's rubbish and lethal.

1332
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,600
- In what way?
JEREMY: The worst thing is the steering.

1333
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,880
You cannot get it going
in a straight line.

1334
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,400
The steering is a horrible compromise,

1335
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,600
cos it's gotta work the steering
wheel and steer the boat.

1336
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,440
"Horrible compromise"
is a way of describing it.

1337
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,400
"Lethal" is another way.

1338
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,040
- It looked great!
- Looked great out there.

1339
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,080
- Did it?
- JAMES: Yeah.

1340
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,040
- I was doing about 4mph.
- RICHARD: Well, that's a start.

1341
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,120
JEREMY: Then, an official
came on the Tannoy

1342
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,080
to announce my result.

1343
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,520
Sequence 46, the Pond Bug.

1344
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,840

01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,560
Which is a new National Record.

What do you mean "we" did it?

1352
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,760
Would you have swam it?

1353
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,880
- I did it!
- We did it!

No, wait, they're applauding
us as a team.

Listen! I'm sorry to go on about this,

1360
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,320
but Roger Bannister was the first

1361
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,720
to break the four-minute mile.

1362
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,440
Not the man who made his shoes.

Edmund Hillary was the first
to go up Everest.

1364

Not the man who made his rucksack.

1365
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,560
- So?
- So, I was the first...

1366
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,960
I was the first to do that!

1367
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,280
I broke the record, not you two!

1368
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:30,160
Yeah, the truth is,
to be honest, we failed.

1369
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,640
You didn't fail.

1370
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,240
I mean, if you'd spent less
time getting your hair cut

1371
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,960
and more time working on the
engine so that it ran properly,

1372
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,360
I reckon that thing
would probably do 60 or 70.

1373
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,160
On flat water, it definitely would.

1374
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,120
Yeah, but the thing is,
we gave it the square chines,

1375
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,640
that really terrible steering,

1376
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,840
the fantastically complicated
knobs and buttons and things.

1377
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:55,120
Basically, we built a death
trap, and it didn't work.

1378
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,880
Well, so you're...
Let me get this straight.

1379
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,920
You were hoping I would
become one of the 85%

1380
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,640
who died trying to break a record?

1381
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,200
BOTH: Yes.

1382
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,480
So we're now actively trying
to kill each other?

1383
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,840
Yes, and we can't even do that properly!

1384
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,720
And on that terrible
disappointment, it's time to end.

1385
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,960
Thank you so much for watching.

1386
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,520
- Goodbye!
- Bye-bye.

1387
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,560
(CHEERING)
