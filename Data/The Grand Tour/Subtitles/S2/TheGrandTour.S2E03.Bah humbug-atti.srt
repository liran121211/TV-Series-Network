1
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,520
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much, everyone.

2
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,040
Hello.

3
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,080
Hello, everyone!

4
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,600
Thank you.

5
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,360
Thank you, everybody. Thank you so much.

6
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,440
Thank you.

7
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,120
Thank you so much.
Welcome, and Happy Christmas.

8
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,240
And in this show, which
has a tree over there,

9
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,240
and nothing else festive at all...

10
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,440
I drive the Bugatti Chiron
in Saint-Tropez.

11
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,600
And in the Alps.

12
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,640
And through the streets of Turin.

13
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,520
But we start with James May, who
has been driving a Kia hatchback.

14
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,760
So, he drives around the best bits of
Europe in a Bugatti and you get a Kia!

15
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,840
You can shut up, Hammond,

16
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,960
because, if you remember rightly,

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,320
you were supposed to go
and drive the Kia hatchback,

18
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,440
but you couldn't, because you can't
drive round corners without crashing.

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,560
Oh, yeah.

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,800
- Were you his stand-in?
- Yes.

21
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,400
- Has he said "thank you"?
- No, he hasn't, actually.

22
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,080
That's unbelievably selfish.
You should have done, really.

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,360
- Well, I'd broken my leg!
- Well, don't go on about it.

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,880
That's all we hear: "I broke
my leg! I broke my leg!"

25
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,520
It doesn't matter,
because the Kia hatchback

26
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,560
that Hammond should have
been driving, but wasn't,

27
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,680
turns out to be not as boring
as you might expect,

28
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,720
as I shall now explain.

29
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,120
To do my explaining, I've come here,

30
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,960
to the sunny Balearic island of Majorca,

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,880
where we find this.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,920
Kia's first attempt to make a saloon car
that's sporty, rather than sensible.

33
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,200
It even has a cool name.
It's called the Stinger.

34
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,240
Check this out.

35
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,760
This is the little keyless fob
that locks and unlocks it,

36
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,720
and you could see that as the
button that launches a missile.

37
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,080
To the Stinger.

38
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,680
Besides a key from Fighter Command,

39
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,920
the Stinger has other things
designed to give you the fizz.

40
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,760
Power, for example. This has
a 3.3-litre twin-turbo V6,

41
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,240
developing 365 horsepower.

42
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,440
Now, that's not Vindaloo-hot,
like a BMW M3.

43
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,760
It's more Madras-hot, I think.

44
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Say an Audi S4.

45
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,880
And if you're watching in America,

46
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,320
I'm using here the car-curry
performance index.

47
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,000
Very popular in Britain.

48
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,200
If you prefer numbers, it does 0
to 60 in around five seconds.

49
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,520
And it has a top speed just
short of 170 miles an hour.

50
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,960
So, again, that's not
as fast as a BMW M3,

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,160
but it's probably fast enough to outrun

52
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,760
one of Kim Jong-un's
wonky northern missiles.

53
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,040
And there's more sporty stuff.

54
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,520
I have an eight-speed,
semi-automatic gearbox,

55
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,520
which I can control with paddles,

56
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,600
and that most important
of sports-saloon requirements:

57
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,200
rear-wheel drive.

58
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,480
It's also groaning with equipment.

59
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
I'll run you through
just a few of the things.

60
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,080
I've got a 15-speaker stereo.
I've got a head-up display,

61
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,080
adaptive cruise control,

62
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,080
collision warning system,

63
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,080
driver-drowsiness warning system.

64
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,560
Very useful when I'm on board.

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,240
All of this in a car
costing around £40,000,

66
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,240
which makes it £5,000 less than
the equivalent Jag or Audi.

67
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,320
But never mind
the not unreasonable price.

68
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,600
The Stinger's main purpose is to show
that Kia can make a sporty saloon.

69
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,040
So, to find out if they've succeeded,
we need to do something sporty.

70
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,320
Which brings me here.

71
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,920
To this road.

72
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,920
A challenging five-kilometre
scribble of Tarmac,

73
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,360
spearing and snaking up through
the Majorcan hills.

74
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,280
What I intend to do is start down
there and drive as fast as possible

75
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,240
to a finishing point
here on this bridge.

76
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,520
And to spice it up,
I'm making it a race.

77
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,520
It's me and the Stinger versus
some young men on planks.

78
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,520
Here's one of them,
and here's the other one.

79
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,600
They both dress like bike racers,
but their preferred transport

80
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,440
is specially modified skateboards,

81
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,280
which hardly sounds like much
of a threat to the car.

82
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,480
OK. Tell us about those skateboards.

83
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,000
What, sort of bicycle speeds? 20, 30?

84
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,520
The fastest we can go
is 75 miles an hour. 120K.

85
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,400
75 miles an hour?

86
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,680
On that?

87
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,560
Do you mind if I...?

88
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,240
Yeah. Knock yourself out. Not literally.

89
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,280
75 miles an hour on a piece of wood
with some plastic wheels on it?

90
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,520
You're mad.

91
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,480
Right. Just so we're clear on the rules,

92
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,320
I'm going to start down there
at the start line

93
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,360
and drive uphill all the way to
here, which is the finish line,

94
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,720
while you start here on what is my finish
line, but is actually your start line,

95
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,960
and you're downhill all the way.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,960
So, if you see "finish" upside
down, you're at the start,

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,360
but "start" the right way up,
you're at your start.

98
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,200
And when I see "start" upside down,
it's your start, but it's my finish,

99
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,520
cos it says "finish" the right way up.

100
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,000
There's a point where we cross
over, obviously, so be careful.

101
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,080
Let's just agree: stay right
if we see each other?

102
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,320
Your right or our right?

103
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,320
Well, it's the same thing, cos you're
going the other way, downhill,

104
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,080
and I'm going uphill
towards this finish.

105
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,600
OK.

106
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,560
No. Yeah. No, the left.
No, just stay... Yeah.

107
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,320
Soon we were in position at our
respective start/finish lines.

108
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,400
Right. Setup.

109
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,920
We're going to go for the sportiest
mode, which is Sport Plus.

110
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,680
Traction & Stability Control disabled.
That's all the nannies off.

111
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,160
It is a hill climb. Don't bin it, May.

112
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,360
Here we go. Horsepower versus gravity.

113
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,440
Isaac Newton and dudes
versus South Korea and me.

114
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,560
Three, two, one.

115
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,360
Keep the foot in. Yes.

116
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,640
Throttle response a bit more chippy
when you've got it on Sport Plus.

117
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,800
Yes. Little bit of sideways action.

118
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,720
I've got a limited-slip diff.
That's going to look after me.

119
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,600
Brake. Turn it.

120
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,680
On the exit. There it is.

121
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh, those rocks
don't look nice! Aaaarghh!

122
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,320
Easy right, then a bit of a left.

123
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,320
Here they come. Keep right!

124
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,640
Jeez, those guys are going!

125
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,240
And for them, the remaining course
was full of fast straights,

126
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,760
whereas, for me, the road
was now becoming twistier.

127
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,320
Stay out, stay out, stay out.
Mind the rocks.

128
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,960
Apex. See the exit.
Squares it. That's lovely!

129
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,600
Yes, there's the bridge.

130
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,960
Here I come! Here I come!
Don't bin it now.

131
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,680
Aaaarghh!

132
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes! Yes.

133
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,600
Right. Let's have it.

134
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,120
- Yeah, buddy.
- Yeah, buddy.

135
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,080
OK, James. The boarders did
it in five minutes and 16 seconds.

136
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,800
You did it in five minutes
and ten seconds.

137
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,080
Yes! Yes! Yes!

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,640
Losers!

139
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,360
Losers! Losers!

140
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,240
Whatever. ...that guy.

141
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,560
Bad winner.

142
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,320
- He's a bad winner.
- Yeah, exactly.

143
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,600
Appalling.

144
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,920
Yep.

145
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,960
Standard reaction from James May.

146
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,440
James, I am very curious.

147
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,800
How did you manage to go to Majorca
in all that beautiful sunshine

148
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,560
and not catch pneumonia?

149
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,360
Well, I mean, it's a danger.

150
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,120
No, it's funny you should ask,
but actually, I did go

151
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,240
past a lot of places
that sold pneumonia.

152
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,560
But I didn't go in
because I had to get up

153
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,240
the next day early and go to work.

154
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,920
Let's move on, because it is now time

155
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,200
for us to peer down a manhole
of chat on Conversation Street.

156
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,080
That's festive. The tree and that.

157
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,440
And I think we should do
more festive stuff now.

158
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,480
- Yes.
- And turn on the lights

159
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,080
on our motoring-flavoured tree.

160
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,760
Yes, and I'd like to go first, if
I turn on the lights I've made

161
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,960
using the back lights from various cars.

162
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,360
Look. That's Christmassy, isn't it? Ahh!

163
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,560
I'd like to add my lights to the festive
tree, which I've made out of indicators.

164
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,600
So, they're orange and they flash,
and they're warm. Are you ready?

165
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,240
- Oh, Christmassy!
- How about that, then?

166
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,800
- Right...
- No!

167
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,120
Why not?

168
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,600
Do not switch on whatever you've made.

169
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,280
- Why?
- Because you'll blind everybody in the tent.

170
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,280
Why do you always think
I'll have overdone it?

171
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,320
Because you always overdo it.

172
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,000
- Ready?
- Oh, dear God!

173
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,640
What do you think of that?
Why are you grimacing?

174
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,320
Don't encourage him.

175
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,560
What? It's brilliant.

176
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,480
It's a bit bright, I admit, but...

177
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,640
It is bright. You've burnt
people's eyes out.

178
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,880
- Why is it a cross?
- It's the baby Jesus.

179
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,560
It's the baby Jesus, not the dead Jesus.

180
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,920
What?

181
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,320
The cross is what he was
crucified on. That's Easter.

182
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,440
Oh.

183
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,440
So, what should it be at Christmas?

184
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,960
A star.

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,320
- That's Jewish.
- No.

186
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,520
It is. Jews don't do Christmas.

187
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,680
It's a different sort of star.

188
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,240
You've used the wrong religious symbol.

189
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,320
What that is is a big spoiler alert.

190
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,680
Yes.

191
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,760
It is, yeah!

192
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,880
- I've given away the ending?
- Yeah.

193
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,080
If you don't want to know what happens
to the baby Jesus later, look away now.

194
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,920
Last year we looked at all the
motoring-related Christmas presents

195
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,640
you could buy,
and they were all terrible.

196
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,800
In fact, they always are terrible.

197
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,640
Actually, the most terrible of them all
I've got in here. It's Scalextric.

198
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,040
- Oh, come on.
- What do you mean?

199
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,040
- Well, I like Scalextric.
- Ah, you're wrong.

200
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,840
- No, you are wrong.
- How could I be wrong about what I'm like?

201
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,680
- You don't like it.
- You think you like it.

202
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,840
- I do.
- It's like classical music.

203
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,880
People think they like classical music,
but they don't. Nobody does, really.

204
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,480
I do.

205
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,440
Anyway, back to Scalextric,
which nobody likes, OK?

206
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,640
The Professor of Sweeping Statements!

207
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,800
Let me explain the problem, okay?
This is how Scalextric works.

208
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,520
You take out the car. "Wow!" you think.

209
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,480
"Look at that. It's like a Dodge Viper."

210
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,480
And then throw it under some furniture.

211
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,400
And you have just played Scalextric.

212
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,720
Cos that's what happens
immediately with Scalextric.

213
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,920
No, you get your
little sister to pick it up.

214
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,440
Scalextric should come with
a little sister. Mine did.

215
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,280
No, no. No, it shouldn't come
with a little sister.

216
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,240
It did.

217
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,440
- Did you say that out loud?
- Yeah, he did.

218
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,280
I was hoping to just carry on.

219
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,200
My sister's 12 years younger.
The year I got my Scalextric,

220
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,800
I also got a little sister.

221
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,160
Don't disillusion him of it!

222
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,840
He thinks that's where they come from.

223
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,800
- It came from Hornby Hobbies.
- It shouldn't arrive at all!

224
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,880
Two things are going to happen.

225
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,160
Either you go too fast, in which
case the car goes under furniture,

226
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,640
or you get the speed right and
it just goes round and round

227
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,840
and round and round, for ever.

228
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,240
Yes, you find the speed at which the cars
don't come off and then just watch them.

229
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,800
What you're doing at that point
is watching electricity happen.

230
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,480
Yes.

231
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,560
I can see why you were
disappointed, Hammond.

232
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,800
You put an electric car on a race track

233
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,880
and, next thing you know,
you've crashed.

234
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,320
Sorry. That was a bit...

235
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,880
That was...

236
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,760
That wasn't even in the back.
That was in the face!

237
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,680
I have got some Bentley...
espresso cups and saucers.

238
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,160
- What do you think of that?
- No, no, I quite like those.

239
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,080
- The colours...
- They're horrible.

240
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,160
- They're too thick.
- Ah, they're not,

241
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,120
cos espresso cups have to be thick.

242
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,160
They have to weigh 147.8 grams.

243
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,800
- Says who?
- Italian coffee scientists.

244
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,720
- That's a fact.
- That is pretentious twaddle.

245
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,920
- It isn't.
- Just try it in a restaurant.

246
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,320
Call the waiter over.
"Come here, my man. Ahem.

247
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,680
I think you know what I'm going
to tell you about this cup.

248
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,200
It's too heavy."

249
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,600
- But it isn't too heavy.
- It is. It's too thick.

250
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,440
It could be hit with a hammer
and survive.

251
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,000
What, and that's a bad thing?

252
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,480
Oh, don't hit it with a hammer.

253
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,960
I was wrong.

254
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,880
I was actually going to take those home.

255
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
Ah, you can. You can, actually.
There you go.

256
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,720
There's your set of three Bentley
espresso cups and saucers.

257
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,160
And you get a spare saucer,
in case you break one.

258
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,640
It's nice. Spare.
It's a good present, that.

259
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,600
I have actually got you
a present, Hammond.

260
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,120
- Have you?
- It's in a presentation box. Here it is.

261
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,680
The box is broken, and I apologise for
that, but there it is. Check it out.

262
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,360
It's a ruined watch.

263
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,080
Not just any ruined watch.
It's your ruined watch.

264
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,240
- Is it?
- That has been retrieved

265
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,080
from the wreckage of the car that you
destroyed, with your incompetence,

266
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,240
and that survived the fire.

267
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,520
It's actually still... It doesn't
look pretty, but it's still working.

268
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,800
Well, that's actually quite a
nice present, in a way, isn't it?

269
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,920
Exactly, and they've written
a little thing on the box.

270
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,920
"Made in Switzerland,"

271
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,120
and then, "Carefully perfected
on 10th June 2017

272
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,560
by the British."

273
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,440
They don't mean "perfected", do they?

274
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,120
No, and by "British" they mean you.

275
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,320
Yeah. It's actually quite
a mean present, after all.

276
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,160
Well, look, Hammond.
I've got you something.

277
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,800
I have got you a pair of running shoes,

278
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,200
and I've added to them the logo
of your favourite local car maker,

279
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,000
and you can't say you don't like that.

280
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,080
You love running.
You go running every morning.

281
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,520
I've seen you go running
in the evening, as well.

282
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,080
I cannot wear those.

283
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,280
Why not?

284
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,680
Because I'm not allowed to run
any more. I broke my leg.

285
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,640
Oh, stop going on about it!

286
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,240
It's all he talks about: "I
broke my leg! I broke my leg!"

287
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,160
We brought you those presents.
Two of them.

288
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,040
I've got you another present here.

289
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,640
Look at that. An alarm clock.

290
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,320
Made it myself. It's beautifully styled.

291
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,440
Oh, funny. It's crashed. I see. Ha-ha.

292
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,360
Yeah, it's a crashed car on top.
That's why it's yours.

293
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,000
Right, I'm just setting it now.
Now, pretend to be asleep.

294
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,920
- What? Oh, all right.
- Just pretend to be asleep.

295
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,520
This is on your bedside table.

296
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,440
Yes, OK. I'm asleep.

297
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,560
There it is.

298
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,840
Christ!

299
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,440
It's going off.

300
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,280
- That's my alarm?
- Yes.

301
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,800
- Well, that's...
- Come on!

302
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,600
I can't have that. That'll...
That'll just set fire...

303
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,560
- Haven't got my glasses.
- That'll just set fire to everything on my...

304
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,480
- Sorry.
- Oh, God!

305
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,640
It's not me that's on fire this time!

306
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,920
I missed. I haven't got my glasses.

307
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,600
I can't wake up to that every morning.

308
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,320
When you're driving along
and your car catches fire,

309
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,240
which it will,
cos you'll have crashed it...

310
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,080
...you'll be used to it,

311
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,440
cos you'll have to put
a fire out every morning.

312
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,960
Yes, I won't have slept for a year, waiting
for an explosion next to my bed...

313
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,160
Stop moaning about all
the presents we've given you!

314
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,840
It's traumatising!

315
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,440
Look. I have bought you
a pair of trousers.

316
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,200
- There you go.
- What? Oh, thank you, James. Very nice.

317
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,160
Not just any old trousers.

318
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,000
No, they've got Velcro
on them. What's that about?

319
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,560
Well, it means the paramedics won't
have to cut your clothes off you.

320
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,560
And you'll save a fortune over
the coming year, you see?

321
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,040
- Have you got us anything?
- No.

322
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,760
Not a thing?

323
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,080
Well, I didn't know we were doing this.

324
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,840
What do you mean? You didn't know it
was Christmas? It's in your diary.

325
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,040
It's in everybody's diary.

326
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,760
It's not like Easter, moving around.
It's the same day every year.

327
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,520
Every single year.

328
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,120
You could have sent a memo,
saying we're doing presents.

329
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,840
Unbelievable.

330
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,200
Anyway, Jeremy Clarkson...

331
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,800
Not everybody is as thoughtless
as Richard Hammond.

332
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,560
I'm certainly not, and I have
bought you a present.

333
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,240
- Oh, thank you, James.
- It's the season of goodwill to all men.

334
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
Even if you hate them.

335
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,480
I have got you,
for Christmas, a T-shirt.

336
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,040
- Are they my lungs?
- Yes, they are.

337
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,040
That was when I... It is.

338
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,640
A lot of work went into this, cos I had
to ring up the hospital in Majorca,

339
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,880
and I asked the barman...
Sorry, the doctor.

340
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,040
...for a copy of the scan of your
lungs, and I printed it on the T-shirt.

341
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,880
- And this bit, this is the...
- That was the pneumonia?

342
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,440
Yeah, that's the bit where
your lungs were infected.

343
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,840
I've coloured that in pink, you know, to
show your favourite type of pneumonia.

344
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,080
- Is that... Are they bubbles?
- Yes.

345
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,680
James, I don't drink Prosecco.
I'm not a girl.

346
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,360
Oh, no, of course. You're
the Viking Jeremy Clarkson,

347
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,240
with his still pink wine, which
you drink out of a hollow horn.

348
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,560
All real men drink rosé.

349
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,400
Thank you, James. That is a thoughtful
gift and I shall treasure it.

350
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,280
No, it's OK, Jeremy.

351
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,560
There is as much pleasure
in giving as in receiving.

352
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,720
I suspect more...

353
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,040
Leave it! Leave it.

354
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,480
- Leave that where it is.
- Yeah.

355
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,120
I've got you
a properly brilliant present.

356
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,000
- I can't wait.
- No, seriously.

357
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,280
You know the problem with
trying to open a fridge door?

358
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,080
- No, that's not a problem.
- Yes, it is. No, it is.

359
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,840
No, you pull the thing
and, with my fridge,

360
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,920
the seal is stronger than
the weight of the fridge,

361
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,720
so you just end up pulling the
fridge across the kitchen floor.

362
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,320
No, that's because you're an ape.

363
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,360
The only way of opening
my fridge is to surprise it.

364
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,120
- Surprise your fridge?
- You walk up to it backwards

365
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,760
and then snatch it like that,

366
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,920
because you have to yank it
really quickly.

367
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,640
But I'm not joking. The other day,
I did that and the fridge fell...

368
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,680
Actually the whole thing on top of me.

369
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,400
Are you sure your fridge
doesn't have a push door?

370
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,560
Anyway, I've got you, James May...
It's a big present, this one.

371
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,360
Right. Ready? I've got you a
fridge with a motoring flavour,

372
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,960
cos I put a steering wheel on the door.

373
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,200
So... OK, it's now shut, yes?

374
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,800
Oh, thank you very much.

375
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,720
Relax. OK?

376
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,360
- So, it won't open. Yes?
- Right.

377
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,800
But then, if you turn this... It's
modelled on a submarine door,

378
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,760
cos it's important, with a submarine,
you know when a door's open or shut.

379
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,760
All the way over, and then
it opens. Can you see?

380
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,200
- Yeah, I can see.
- Well, how brilliant's that?

381
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,480
You've bought me a solution
to a problem only you have.

382
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,160
That is the worst Christmas
present I've ever had.

383
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,400
It isn't. How can it be? Why is it?

384
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,600
- You've bought something for yourself.
- No, you did that last year.

385
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,200
You bought your girlfriend a Ferrari
that only you were insured to drive.

386
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,880
You did.

387
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,480
"Oh, I bought you this," and
no-one else could drive it.

388
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
- That's chivalry.
- Is it?

389
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,440
Well, I think that's just been a
total disaster, Conversation Street.

390
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,320
- It was awful.
- He bought us nothing.

391
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,400
- I bought you a present...
- I'm sorry.

392
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,440
Shut up. I made you presents
you don't like.

393
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,040
No. All right. Let's move on.

394
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,640
Now, have you ever wondered if office
lunch time could be more interesting?

395
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,880
- No, nobody's wondered that.
- Well, we have...

396
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,840
...which is why

397
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,120
James and I decided to take
the Grand Tour to Dunstable.

398
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,640
This is what we're on about.

399
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,240
People in offices all over the world

400
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,320
just frittering away
their valuable lunch hours

401
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,640
doing pointless things on their
phones and eating plastic food.

402
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,480
But not any more,

403
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,240
because we're here
to literally save lunch times

404
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,880
through the crucible of motorsport.

405
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,760
And you may be watching this and
thinking, "Well, that's a great idea,

406
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,480
but how do you get all these people

407
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,960
to a race track
during their lunch hour?"

408
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,200
Well, the answer is, we don't need to.

409
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,160
The race track is already here.

410
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,880
Yes, go to any business park anywhere,

411
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,520
and you'll find long straights,
flowing roundabouts,

412
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,800
sharp bends, the lot.

413
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,280
There's a circuit to rival
Silverstone or Laguna Seca

414
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,000
right outside your office window.

415
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,960
Today we've chosen Houghton Hall
Business Park near Dunstable.

416
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,520
So, let's see what kind
of track it can provide.

417
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,120
This is the Kia Picanto GT line,

418
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,200
the hottest ship in the Picanto range.

419
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,800
- Is it?
- 80 horsepower from 1.25 litres.

420
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,720
Yes, just get in the bloody thing.

421
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,920
- I'm saying a lot, cos it takes him so long to get in.
- Shut up!

422
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,000
So, what are we doing?

423
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,600
We're going down the straight towards the first
roundabout, which is Froughton's Haulage.

424
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,920
I like the braking-distance markers.
That's a nice touch. Very professional.

425
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:51,080
This is the Whitbread, extremely tight
left-hander, and into Car Park A.

426
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,000
Now, there's a speed hump, and
then the soon-to-be immortalised

427
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,840
Smokers' Shelter complex.

428
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,760
- Nice.
- Which is what we're in now.

429
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:03,280
Dab of brakes. Apex it there,
and we're into Car Park B.

430
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,280
This is Office Chair Bend.
This is the chicane...

431
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,120
- Very nice.
- ...before we go

432
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,120
back onto the beginning
and ending straight

433
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,640
and head towards Mannington
Plastics Roundabout.

434
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,840
Leaders in injection-moulding
technology solutions.

435
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,720
Excellent. Quite the landmark.

436
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,800
Keep it wide. Half-throttle.

437
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,400
Look for the exit, and there
we are... across the line.

438
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,640
Once you're across the line,
you can slow down.

439
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,840
No point in continuing to go fast, cos
you could have an accident doing that.

440
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,800
Funny.

441
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,000
With the track signed
off, we selected two firms

442
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,240
to go head-to-head
during their lunch hours.

443
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,440
Today, the competitors are Storage King,

444
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,560
"Self-storage made simple",

445
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,160
and Cura Technical, "Leading
providers of IT support solutions".

446
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,640
And once their contenders
had been selected,

447
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,440
it was time for the driver briefing.

448
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,600
"Each entrant from each firm
does one timed lap.

449
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,120
Using those lap times, we'll
whittle down our entrants,

450
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,800
until we have the best driver
from each of the two firms."

451
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,640
Hammond, everybody in the room can read.

452
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,680
Shut up. "They'll then go
head-to-head in the grand final,

453
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,840
to decide the ultimate winner
of today's round."

454
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,680
With Hammond's presentation over,

455
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,120
it was time to begin the
qualifying laps that would decide

456
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,880
which employees would represent their
firms in the shoot-out grand finale.

457
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,920
What we have first is
Pete from Cura Technical.

458
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,200
He is the regional manager for
Bedfordshire and the Midlands,

459
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,680
in his Vauxhall SRI Astra.

460
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,200
In three, two, one... go!

461
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,480
As the regional manager scorched away,

462
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,560
I commandeered the security hut,

463
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,120
so that I could use its CCTV feed
to commentate on the action.

464
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,000
There's a complex of turns through
here, really more than just one,

465
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,920
and that speed hump to deal with, as
well. He's done that. He is through.

466
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:03,360
He's on his way through the Office Chair
complex. I can't see him on that camera.

467
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,480
Here he is. He's coming
back up the straight.

468
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,680
200 brake horsepower. Useful now.

469
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,480
Going to make his way
towards Froughton Haulage,

470
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,640
which is soon to become the ending line.

471
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,200
Huge amount of noise!
And across the line.

472
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,480
After a cracking qualifying performance

473
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,640
from Pete of Cura Technical...

474
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,720
1:06.16.

475
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,080
...Storage King
sent out their first driver,

476
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,600
hot-hatch enthusiast
Darren from logistics.

477
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,400
Two, one... go!

478
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,080
I do like a Clio.

479
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,800
Oh, some sideways action.

480
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,600
Oh, lovely work!

481
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,240
By ragging his Clio
for all it was worth...

482
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,720
...Storage King's Darren banged
in a scorcher of a qualifier.

483
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,840
Oh!

484
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,200
- 1:05.97.
- Oh, ho-ho!

485
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,840
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
from Cura Technical,

486
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,560
it's Nick from Accounts,

487
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,640
who will be looking to...
balance the books.

488
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,040
Oh, God. He's making puns.

489
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,280
In three, two, one! And he's off!

490
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,000
Despite being at the
wheel of a motorway cruiser,

491
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,760
Nick seemed determined
to top the timing charts.

492
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,680
Oh, this looks fast to me,
towards Smokers' Corner.

493
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,040
However...

494
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,120
And he's... Yeah, that's looking...

495
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,160
No, that's not under control,
because he's binned it!

496
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,920
And he's binned it.

497
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,200
He's binned it at Bin Corner,
appropriately enough.

498
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,280
It is a DNF for Nick from Accounts.

499
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,520
The fleet manager
is not going to be pleased.

500
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,480
There are going to be words when he
gets back after lunch, I suspect.

501
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,120
With the lunch-hour clock ticking away,

502
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,920
there followed a final flurry
of qualifying laps.

503
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,000
Three, two, one... go!

504
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,360
Oh, it's a fizzy start
from the little Abarth.

505
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,720
This is a tight little car,
for a small circuit.

506
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,360
It's built for business-park
racing. Look at that!

507
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,440
It's Chris from Marketing
in the Toyota GT86.

508
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,640
1:03.24.

509
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,600
And then, with the results in,

510
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,400
it was time for the grand-finale
showdown shoot-out.

511
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,600
Now, representing Storage King,

512
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,560
in the Seat Leon Cupra R,

513
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,120
from Purchasing, it's Gav.

514
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,920
And representing Cura Technical,

515
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,560
in the BMW E90 M3, from Sales,

516
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,880
give it up for Steve!

517
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,320
And since we are dealing with the best

518
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,320
that South Bedfordshire has to offer:

519
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,080
the crème de menthe of
business-park driving talent,

520
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,080
this final will be decided with
a straight head-to-head race.

521
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:04,880
OK. Here we go. Ready. Ready.
In three, two,

522
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,320
one... Go!

523
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,880
And there they go. Steve against Gav,

524
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:16,040
Sales against Purchasing,
battling down the main straight.

525
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,960
Froughton comes up first.
They're both through.

526
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,120
They're both already in Car Park
A, heading for Smokers' Corner.

527
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,600
Oh, he's gone very wide there.

528
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,840
And the Seat is through.

529
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,480
The Seat is in front, but not by much.

530
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,480
I daren't watch. This is tight.

531
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:41,440
I would hate to have been having a fag
in that booth when they came past.

532
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,320
Car Park B coming up. Look at this!
Tailing one another through there.

533
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,640
I don't know how these two companies
get on. Is there rivalry there?

534
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,160
Are they getting something
out of their system?

535
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,760
Already coming back up. Through
Froughton's for the second time.

536
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,360
These guys do mean business!

537
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,000
- Half a car's length in it.
- Look at the speed they're carrying!

538
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,600
Oh! Close!

539
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,120
Both of them now up to Mannington's
Plastics, and it's really tight there.

540
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,640
And across the line!
The BMW takes the flag.

541
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,960
Yaaarghh!

542
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,200
How about that?

543
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,360
Well, there we are. That's...
That's that all sorted out.

544
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,840
And now it's time to sort
something else out, as well,

545
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,360
as we play Celebrity Face Off!

546
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,520
Once again...

547
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,600
Once again, it is an
international event,

548
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,000
Britain versus America.

549
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,000
And the question is, and it's a big one:

550
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,960
who is the fastest person in the world

551
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
who lives with a bear?

552
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,160
To find out, please welcome Casey
Anderson and Hugh Bonneville!

553
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,440
Gentlemen.

554
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,200
- Hugh, have a seat.
- Thank you.

555
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,400
Casey, have a seat.

556
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,480
You go here - that one.
Yeah, you're that one.

557
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,520
Thank you for coming. First of all, I
know you live with a bear, obviously.

558
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
- Obviously.
- But it's not a real bear.

559
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,440
No, Paddington's like a CGI bear.

560
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,040
You may say that!

561
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,160
And, Casey, you do live
with an actual bear.

562
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,560
That's right, yeah.
Big bear. Like, 800 pounds.

563
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,240
800 pounds?

564
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,240
Yeah, 800 or 900 pounds, depending
on what he had for dinner.

565
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,520
The thing is, you rescued this bear
when it was little, in Montana.

566
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,960
Yeah, he was literally that big when I
rescued him, only a couple of months old,

567
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,280
and now he's 15 years old,
stands about eight feet tall.

568
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,160
But did you know that was going
to happen, or were you surprised?

569
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,280
"Jesus Christ! Look at the size of it."

570
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,600
Well, you have this cute little
bear for a little while,

571
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,520
and then all of a sudden, he's ripping
the couch up and eating the cushions,

572
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,440
trying to get in the
refrigerator for the beer.

573
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,520
- You say he drinks beer?
- Bears love beer.

574
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,840
Who'd have thought? I mean, I remember
one time just cracking that open,

575
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,680
and they have
an incredible sense of smell.

576
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,120
Have we got a picture of him
drinking beer?

577
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,600
That's not Stella, I hope, cos
you don't want a bear on Stella,

578
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,240
or Wife-Beater, as we call it over here.

579
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,320
He doesn't live in a cage?

580
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,920
No, he lives in the sanctuary
part of the time.

581
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,440
He's at the house part of the
time, depending on what...

582
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,920
He loves to be around people. That's all
he knows. He can't be out in the wild.

583
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,960
OK, I get that... but you had
him as your best man?

584
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,960
He was best man at one of...
Yeah, he was.

585
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,600
We actually have a photograph
of the wedding here.

586
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,440
That's the sloppiest kiss
I had that night.

587
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,200
And then he came
for Thanksgiving dinners?

588
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,880
I think we've got a picture of that.

589
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,600
There - look.

590
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,120
- That is a big bear.
- That's huge.

591
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,200
- Does he like turkey?
- He loves turkey.

592
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,680
Ate the whole thing.
Mashed potatoes. Everything.

593
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,120
Can I just ask...? You have a
sanctuary, a bear sanctuary.

594
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,840
- Correct.
- And how's the dynamic,

595
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,640
like, compared to his dynamic
with you and the other bears?

596
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,320
Does he go, "Hey, I get on with
humans and you don't"?

597
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,000
A little bit. I mean, he's the
one that gets to come home

598
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,600
and do things that the other
bears can't really do.

599
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,400
But it's like a soap opera.

600
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,400
He has different relationships
with different bears.

601
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,080
He's got a girlfriend named
Bella who's younger than him,

602
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,040
and they wrestle around all the time.

603
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,320
So, that's your bear, OK? Now,
yours is rather different.

604
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,920
Yes, thankfully!

605
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,640
Although yours is probably more
mischievous. Paddington is.

606
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,520
Yes, he gets stuck
in the fridge, in the film...

607
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,440
- Impossible.
- Have you come across Paddington Bear in America?

608
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,320
- Yeah, definitely.
- Because it very much has been a British

609
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,600
character for decades, really.

610
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,400
But he gets up to all sorts of mischief,
and his favourite thing is marmalade.

611
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,120
And so, apart from getting stuck
in the fridge...

612
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,480
This time round, in the second film,

613
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,480
he tries to become a barber, he
tries to be a window cleaner.

614
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,720
None of these things
go particularly well.

615
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,520
We do have a clip. I'd like to
show that for you now, if I may.

616
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,520
I'm sorry. This is
a private conversation.

617
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,840
Oh, it's all right, Mr Brown.
This is my friend, Knuckles.

618
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,240
- How are you?
- And this is Phibs.

619
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,360
- G'day.
- Spoon.

620
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,720
- Hello.
- Jimmy the Snitch.

621
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,600
T-Bone. The Professor. Squeaky Pete.

622
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,760
Double Bass Bob. Farmer Jack.
Mad Dog. Johnny Cashpoint.

623
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,000
- Sir Geoffrey Wilcott.
- I hope I can rely on your vote.

624
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,760
And Charley Rumble.

625
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,880
Oh, it's so wonderful to meet you all.

626
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,640
It's a great relief to know

627
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,760
that Paddington's already made
such sweet friends.

628
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,360
Would you excuse us a moment?

629
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,360
- What are you doing?
- Talking to the nice men.

630
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,640
Nice men? Mary,
we can't trust these people.

631
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,320
I mean, look at them.

632
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,960
Talk about a rogues' gallery! Hideous.

633
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,800
And as for that bearded baboon
in the middle,

634
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,040
he's hardly got two brain cells
to rub together.

635
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,680
We can still hear you, Mr Brown.

636
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,720
That was the light you turned off.

637
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,200
It does look good.

638
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,720
I should just set up, or sort
of back-set-up that clip,

639
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,360
which is that Paddington
gets put into prison

640
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,120
for a crime we don't think he committed.

641
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,640
- I'm sure he didn't commit it.
- No.

642
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,680
Somebody was pointing out
to me the other day -

643
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,880
if Paddington really did arrive, and I
won't get bogged down in immigration,

644
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,080
but he would be in contravention of
Section 24 of the Immigration Act.

645
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,520
Cos he's deliberately avoided
the immigration authorities.

646
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,440
- And you, as Mr Brown...
- Yeah?

647
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,840
You would potentially face
prosecution under Section 25,

648
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,880
for assisting unlawful
immigration to a member state.

649
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,040
14 years in prison, that would get you.

650
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,120
Right. Well, there's the plot
of Paddington 3 for you!

651
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,720
Anyway, we must get on to cars,
cos this is... largely a car show.

652
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,400
Now, Casey, the thing about Montana is,

653
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,680
you could pretty much do anything you
liked on the road there, until recently.

654
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,480
Yeah, not long ago, you could drive
100 miles an hour down the road,

655
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,720
drinking a beer, and have
a loaded shotgun in your lap,

656
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,400
and you weren't breaking the law.

657
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,200
- What went wrong?
- Yeah, I know!

658
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,040
Now you can only drive 85.

659
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,560
Cos the rule is, basically: don't crash.

660
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,360
"Just keep it between
the fences", I think...

661
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,680
Yeah, between the fences,
between the ditches.

662
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,560
As long as you don't go off the road,
or maybe a little bit, you're cool.

663
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,280
It's largely gravel roads, as well.

664
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,400
Gravel roads, or icy roads.

665
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,880
I mean, I grew up with Land Cruisers,
Willys Jeeps, big pick-up trucks.

666
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,840
When I haul Brutus around,
I have a big Dodge 3500.

667
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,080
Can he drive a car?

668
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,200
No, but he likes to tear them apart.

669
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,760
There's been times when we're
driving down the road to the vet,

670
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,160
and he's like, "What's this knob?
What's this lever?"

671
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,600
And so the windshield wipers
are going, radio's blaring,

672
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,840
and I'm screaming, "Get back,
Brutus! Get back, Brutus!"

673
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,600
And he's tearing your face off.

674
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,040
You imagine the drivers
driving by, saying...

675
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,920
Now, you're not particularly,
I don't think, a helmsman.

676
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,680
No, I'm not. I'm not a petrol-head
of any, you know, type.

677
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,840
Cars, for me, get me
from A to B, I'm afraid.

678
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,480
In recent months I had my proper,
full-blown midlife crisis

679
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,880
and decided to buy a convertible.

680
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,760
My wife said, "Don't be ridiculous.

681
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,840
It is only sunny in England
about two days a year."

682
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,680
Exactly, yeah. "Don't be so stupid."

683
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,120
So, I went and bought a
convertible, and then I thought,

684
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,800
"Actually, what I really want is
an electric car."

685
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,040
So, I said to my wife at
the end of the summer...

686
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,600
"I'm getting rid of the convertible
and getting an electric car."

687
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,920
She said, "Don't be ridiculous! We've
had a great summer in that convertible.

688
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,800
You're not getting rid of it."

689
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,600
But meanwhile, I'd already placed
an order for a second-hand Tesla.

690
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,080
So, I am now a Tesla owner,
and I love it, Jeremy!

691
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,520
- Which is yours? The S?
- Yes.

692
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,040
And my friend down the road
has the top-of-the-range,

693
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,640
and we actually have
a Tesla coffee group.

694
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,520
Oh, Christ.

695
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,480
- There are three...
- How evangelical!

696
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,760
There are three...
four of us, actually, now.

697
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,680
Another mate's just got one. So,
in about a five-mile radius,

698
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,680
and we literally go and stare
at each other's cars.

699
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,120
I've never had an interest
in cars at all,

700
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,720
and I love my Tesla.

701
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,960
I can't imagine the electric car
has caught on much in Montana.

702
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,520
- I'm part of a Tesla coffee group, too.
- Oh, Christ.

703
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,960
How have we ended up with this?

704
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,520
Right. Now, obviously, you came here
to do your laps. How did it go?

705
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,520
Ah, look, I'm not a driver,
and I would say

706
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,840
that I'm probably about a minute
slower than him. That's my prediction.

707
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,720
A minute would be something
quite spectacular!

708
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,200
I'm like an old granny.

709
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,920
Well, that's cos you're from Downton.

710
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,640
The car had barely been
invented - that's what it is.

711
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,480
The gravel must have been
second nature for you.

712
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,080
Oh, when I heard that there
was gravel, and I saw it,

713
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,320
I'm like, "Oh,
I might have a chance here."

714
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,480
- That was my edge.
- Damn!

715
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,640
Well, now, whose lap
shall we see first? Hmmm...

716
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,160
We'll go with you first of all.

717
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,160
Who'd like to see Hugh's lap?

718
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,240
Let's have a look.

719
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,960
There it is. Two-litre engine
crackling away.

720
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,640
What do you mean, you need the toilet?

721
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,120
You've taken Paddington with you in the car.
And is that a crash helmet he's got on?

722
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,160
- Oh, yes.
- Brilliant.

723
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,320
You're frightened to death. Actually, that's
not too bad. And onto the difficult bit.

724
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,280
- Oh, here we go.
- Yeah, there we are.

725
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,480
Are we going
to get some sideways action?

726
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,120
Oh, yes, we are.

727
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,160
Nearly stopped.

728
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,800
Virtually in reverse.

729
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,480
I think what they're doing is playing
the film in slow motion. Let's be kind.

730
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,280
They did say you were very slow,

731
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,320
but no, that's not very slow.

732
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,000
Hang on. Let's have a look through here.
Tail out again. That's good.

733
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,680
Coming back onto... Oh, no, you've
got a bit of a tank-slapper!

734
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,120
And back on the Tarmac, where it's very
slippery, but you've held that nicely.

735
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,480
Right. Now for the tricky bit.

736
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,680
- Oh, this bit was...
- It's OK. You're making it look tricky.

737
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,240
And there we are, onto the straight.

738
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,040
♪ Here we go round the mulberry
bush, the mulberry bush, the... ♪

739
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,760
Keeping Paddington happy.
Were you flat through there?

740
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,440
Yeah...

741
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,320
That was leaning on it.
You are good on the Tarmac.

742
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,920
Final corner, and tail out again.

743
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,840
Nicely done, Hugh, and across the line!
There we are, everybody.

744
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,600
- Well, done.
- Pretty good.

745
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,080
That's not bad!

746
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:41,520
Honestly... a couple
of slow bits, but not bad.

747
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,640
Who'd like to see Casey's lap? Done
without a bear in his car. Here we go.

748
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,800
Vigorous, little two-litre engine.

749
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,160
OK, this thing has got some power.

750
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,320
Yeah, but it is only two-litre.

751
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,640
I'm amazed that was big enough
for you, with your big pick-ups.

752
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,120
Nicely, tidily done through there.

753
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,760
Very tidy indeed. Keeping it smooth.

754
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,760
And onto the gravel. Now,
this is where he's at home.

755
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,840
Except for the beer and the shotgun.

756
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,760
Oh, nicely held through there,
flicking it back the other way.

757
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,200
Sideways on that one.

758
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,280
Big smile. It is funny
how a fully grown man

759
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,920
can be made to smile
by sliding a car on gravel.

760
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,440
That does look good
in the afternoon sun there,

761
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,240
as the F-Type comes up now,
back towards the Tarmac.

762
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,400
No tank-slapper going on there.
This is always tricky.

763
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,720
You are the master of understeer.

764
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,480
Yep, that looks good. Bit of dust.

765
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,600
Nearly stopped, but we're going again.

766
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,800
It's my nemesis coming up right here.

767
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,680
Yeah. Understeer again?

768
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,920
No, that was really...
Oh, what are you doing?

769
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,920
That's a Scandi Flick, or
something near a Scandi Flick.

770
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,080
And more understeer, and there
we are, ladies and gentlemen.

771
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,800
Across the line, as well!

772
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,440
A little crazy.

773
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,320
So far, the Brits have won
every single week.

774
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,240
- OK.
- We're hoping to keep that up.

775
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,520
I've got the times here.

776
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,000
Hugh Bonneville, you did it...

777
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,160
And just to give you some idea...

778
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,320
The fastest so far is a 1:17.

779
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,560
The slowest is David Hasselhoff. 1:24.

780
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,760
You did it in one

781
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,560
22

782
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,520
.2.

783
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,760
- So, you're faster than David Hasselhoff.
- Beat the Hoff!

784
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,200
- Beat the Hoff.
- Beat the Hoff.

785
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,680
Well done.

786
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,800
But...

787
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,240
Did you beat our American guest,
who's come very far for this?

788
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,520
Casey Anderson.

789
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,560
1:18.6.

790
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,680
Congratulations.

791
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,760
So, there we are -
our first American winner.

792
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,280
First one. Sorry, Hugh.

793
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,640
There we are, ladies and gentlemen.

794
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,480
A very big thanks to Hugh Bonneville

795
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,520
and the fastest man who lives
with a bear, Casey Anderson!

796
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,920
Now, in olden times,

797
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,600
the furthest you could
ever travel in one day

798
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,880
was as far as your horse
could go before it died.

799
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,960
Yeah, and then, in the late '50s, the
invention of jets and helicopters meant,

800
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,040
if you had the money, you could have
breakfast in the South of France on a boat,

801
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,800
go skiing in the Alps at lunch time,

802
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,440
and get to Turin in time
for dinner with a Contessa.

803
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,640
Yeah. Now, this created the jet-set,

804
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,640
which is all very "Where do you go to, my
lovely, when you're alone in your bed?"

805
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,320
But I was wondering,
now that cars are so fast

806
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,200
and roads, by and large, are good -
we have motorways, for example -

807
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,960
do you need the jets
and helicopters any more?

808
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,680
Yeah, you do.

809
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,160
Well, to find out, I took the
Grand Tour to Saint-Tropez.

810
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,080
Giovanni!

811
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,080
Ah, morning.

812
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,640
I've got dinner tonight
in Turin with the Contessa,

813
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,680
but I fancy a bit of skiing.

814
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,080
So, could you bring the car round?

815
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,480
And can you make sure there are no ordinary
people near it? I don't want a disease.

816
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,920
Good.

817
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,480
Soon, Giovanni arrived
at the boat with my car.

818
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,960
And after he'd loaded the boot

819
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,880
with half of what I'd need for the day,

820
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,440
I climbed aboard and set off.

821
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,120
Right. What all these people
are looking at

822
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:36,840
is Bugatti's answer to the
Agusta 109 and Gulfstream G6.

823
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,040
It's called the Chiron, and there's
no other way of saying this.

824
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,880
It's the fastest car in the world.

825
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,680
Obviously, it isn't the fastest
car in the world right now,

826
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,600
because I'm sort of going round
the port in Saint-Tropez,

827
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,720
but this, in fact,
is the Bugatti's party piece.

828
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,040
But think about it.

829
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,960
This is a 1,479-horsepower,

830
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,960
261-mile-an-hour rocket ship.

831
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,280
It is engineering taken
to the max, and then some.

832
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:26,520
And yet I'm doing 20 miles an
hour and it feels like a Golf.

833
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,360
It's like Concorde.

834
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,520
Anyone in the sky in the 1960s

835
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,320
who was doing twice the speed
of sound was wearing a G-suit.

836
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,240
But on Concorde they were doing
twice the speed of sound

837
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,000
while wearing a lounge suit,

838
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:44,800
sipping from a glass of Château Margaux.

839
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,080
That was the brilliance of Concorde.

840
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:53,480
It was right at the edge of what was
technically possible, but it felt normal.

841
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,120
That's what the Bugatti's doing here.

842
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,720
Eventually, though, I emerged

843
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,600
from the summer-long
Saint-Tropez traffic jam

844
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,520
and joined the motorway,

845
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,880
home turf for the Chiron and
the monster that powers it.

846
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,160
It's an eight-litre monster,

847
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,840
with 16 cylinders

848
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,880
and enough grunt to make
kilometres feel like inches.

849
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,520
We all thought the Veyron
was fairly amazing,

850
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:41,400
but this has... out-amazinged it.

851
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,760
Let me give you a few
of the headline statistics.

852
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:52,040
The Chiron accelerates
from 0 to 186 miles an hour

853
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:56,200
faster than a Toyota hatchback
accelerates from 0 to 60.

854
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,960
Flat out, this will
drain its fuel tank...

855
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Ready? ...in nine minutes.

856
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,720
And to put that in a language
the youth can understand,

857
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,960
it's like drinking seven shot glasses
full of petrol every second.

858
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,400
The Chiron has ten radiators.

859
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,600
That's more than I've got
in my apartment.

860
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,360
And then there's the water pump,

861
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,880
which sends 200 gallons of water
a minute round the engine.

862
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,600
That could brim a bath in 12 seconds.

863
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,160
Firemen use less powerful
pumps than that.

864
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,400
It's not a cheap car to buy.

865
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,400
In fact, it costs £2.5 million.

866
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,600
And it's not cheap to run, either.

867
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,680
The tyres, for instance, cost £13,000.

868
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,600
The stats just go on and on and on,

869
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,400
but all you can ever think is,

870
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,280
"Bloody hell, this thing's quick!"

871
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,360
Obviously, I can't show you how
fast on a motorway,

872
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,280
because the French police

873
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,480
have completely lost their sense
of humour about speeding.

874
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,720
So I had to make a call.

875
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,560
Giovanni!

876
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,120
Sir?

877
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,280
Yeah, could you lay on
a deserted air field and...

878
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:33,680
What shall I get? ...a BMW M4
in about 20 seconds?

879
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,200
- Certainly, sir.
- Thanks.

880
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,000
OK. I don't really have time
to do this on my busy day,

881
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,560
but what I'm going to do
is demonstrate to you

882
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,480
the difference between a really fast car

883
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,320
and a Bugatti Chiron.

884
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:18,120
80, 96, 105, 130, 154,

885
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,000
163, 200, 207, 223...

886
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,400
...hell.

887
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,000
Drag-race over, I got back on the road.

888
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,360
There is no doubt in my mind

889
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,480
that this is faster
than flying. It just is.

890
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:45,080
I mean, if I were to be racing Hammond
today in his silly helicopter,

891
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,400
he'd still be sitting at the
heliport in Saint-Tropez, saying,

892
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:54,640
"Requesting ILS Vector, Golf
Tango Donkey Norway Shirley."

893
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,360
All completely unnecessary
gibberish, just so everyone goes,

894
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,520
"Oh, aren't you clever, being
able to fly a helicopter?"

895
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,520
Not really.

896
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,600
I, on the other hand, having got
no clearance at all from anyone,

897
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,440
had turned off the motorway and
into the foothills of the Alps.

898
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,200
And you might imagine that,
on roads like this,

899
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:29,120
a mid-engine supercar would be divine.

900
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,840
But this is no ordinary
mid-engine supercar.

901
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:40,240
A McLaren 720, or a Ford GT,
they would be brilliant here.

902
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:45,400
But this... I'm gonna be honest
with you. It feels heavy.

903
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,000
Because it is. I'm not saying
it's cumbersome.

904
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,840
I'm not saying getting
it up this mountain road

905
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,680
is like getting a cow up a step-ladder.

906
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:58,000
But it's not delicate or deft or dainty.

907
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,080
No, the Chiron,
it tackles mountain roads

908
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,920
in a way I've never experienced before.

909
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,560
Imagine the tear of a newly born child.

910
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,480
Well, this isn't like that.
This is more like...

911
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,520
Mount Vesuvius!

912
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,880
There are no straights in a Chiron.

913
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,880
You come out of a corner and
then you're in the next one.

914
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,240
Pretty much immediately.

915
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,680
Come out of a corner... Wham!

916
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:40,160
Slow down... Blam! Oh, my God! Wham!

917
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,200
Most supercars would
flow up a hill like this,

918
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,880
but this is more staccato.

919
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,160
Weirdly, then, the best way to
enjoy this car on a mountain road

920
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,880
is to drive it much more slowly
than it can actually go.

921
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,080
Is this a bad thing?

922
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,680
Well, not when you remember
who it's been made for.

923
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,400
If you tell the Bugatti customer

924
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,440
that this can generate 2G in the
corners, he won't care less.

925
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,800
Tell him it's got 3K diamonds in the
speakers, and he'll say, "Really?"

926
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,760
Only, in a Russian accent.

927
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,640
I think they've judged this
to perfection.

928
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,960
Soon I arrived at Les Deux Alpes,

929
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,920
where I removed my ski boot
from the boot,

930
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,800
bought another from the shop...

931
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,520
Merci. Oui, à plus tard.

932
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,920
...and went off to find a glacier.

933
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,640
Let's do this.

934
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,720
It is remarkable that,
in this day and age,

935
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,720
I've been able to do this.

936
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,560
Just a few hours ago,
I was in the South of France,

937
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,960
surrounded by people
in their carefully designed,

938
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,280
topless swimsuits.

939
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,600
And now I'm on an Alp, doing skiing,

940
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,880
with the others of the jet-set.

941
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,880
It took rather longer
to get down the glacier

942
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,400
than I'd expected.

943
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,960
So, when I got back to the town,

944
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,560
I had to get my skis off
and my skates on.

945
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,120
Not that you could actually
hear that I had my skates on.

946
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,800
The only really odd noise
you get in a Chiron

947
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,520
is the whoosh
of the turbo-charging system.

948
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,400
Ready?

949
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,560
It's actually relaxing.

950
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,840
It sounds like small wavelets

951
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,520
breaking on a tropical beach.
Here we go.

952
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:44,200
What this car is is just a really nice,

953
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,200
comfortable place to sit,

954
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:52,560
while it gets on with the
business of smashing continents.

955
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,520
And that's exactly what it'd have to do,

956
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,800
if I were to be on time
for my dinner date

957
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,080
with the Contessa in Turin.

958
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,720
Happily, I soon left France,

959
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,000
where they rip your fingernails
out if you break the speed limit,

960
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:11,120
and entered Italy,
where, so far as I can tell,

961
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:15,360
speeding isn't really seen
as a crime at all.

962
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,400
I was once pulled over
by the police in Italy,

963
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,600
when I was driving a Lamborghini,

964
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,480
and they told me I wasn't
driving quickly enough.

965
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,560
"It's a Lamborghini.
When you leave here,

966
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,720
you drive like the wind."

967
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,680
This is my instruction from the police.

968
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,240
Right. It's 47 miles to Turin.

969
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,600
I've got 45 minutes to get
there, and I'm never late.

970
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,800
I'm pathologically punctual.

971
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,960
By taking the police advice and
driving like the wind,

972
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,960
I made it to the outskirts of
Turin with 11 minutes to go.

973
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:58,240
And I had to spend one of those
minutes getting changed

974
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,320
in the bogs at a motorway
service station.

975
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,840
Right.

976
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,840
I have got nine minutes
to make this rendezvous.

977
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,560
This should be interesting.

978
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,920
There was a film called
Rendezvous, made in the 1960s,

979
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,560
when someone tried to cross
Paris in nine minutes.

980
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:41,720
Well, now it was time to put that
16-cylinder engine in Race mode

981
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,320
and make an hommage to that.

982
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,040
20 seconds.

983
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,480
Made it.

984
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,720
- Amazing.
- Rumble.

985
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,720
You can feel it
more than you can hear it.

986
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,840
Yeah, in the chest. But hang on.

987
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,600
Are you seriously saying

988
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,800
that, point to point, a car is
faster than a helicopter?

989
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,640
Well, it's faster than your helicopter.
You start yours with a cord.

990
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:58,040
Duh-duh-duh-duh! You do.

991
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,280
But a car is not faster
than a helicopter.

992
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,320
OK, then, a race. OK?

993
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:07,560
You in your Moulinex Magimix
versus me in that Chiron.

994
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,080
No, I can't. I'm not allowed
to fly it at the moment.

995
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,440
- Why not?
- I broke my leg.

996
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,800
Oh, here we go again! God!

997
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:17,040
So, there we are. Because of
his astonishing selfishness,

998
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:21,280
there will be no race between his
kitchen appliance and the Chiron.

999
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,920
And on that terrible
disappointment, it's time to end.

1000
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,320
Thank you very much
for watching. Goodbye.
