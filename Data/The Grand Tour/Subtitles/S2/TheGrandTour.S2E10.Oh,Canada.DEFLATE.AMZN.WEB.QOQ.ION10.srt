1
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,040
- Hello!
- Greetings!

2
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,520
Thank you so much. Thank you.

3
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,600
Thanks, everybody.

4
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,440
Good noises.

5
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,320
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

6
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,880
Welcome! And in this incredible show...

7
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,840
Richard reads a map...

8
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,520
James wears a hat...

9
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,960
And I remember how old I am.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,800
I'm 57.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Brilliant stuff.

12
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,280
A brilliant show. A good one.

13
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,480
Now, that smorgasbord

14
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,280
of nail-biting action is all to come,

15
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,920
but we start with our feet
firmly on the ground.

16
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,280
You see, us three agree on,
well, almost nothing, really,

17
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,240
but we do agree that all
medium-sized SUVs

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,000
are dreary and drab and rubbish.

19
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,720
Yes, but, and we were talking
about this the other day,

20
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,720
they are incredibly popular.

21
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,240
And we were arguing over
which ones we'd buy,

22
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,920
if we absolutely had to.

23
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,680
Yeah, and needless to say,
we couldn't agree.

24
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,040
No, it got quite heated.

25
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,360
It did get very heated indeed.

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,600
So we decided we should settle it

27
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,560
by taking The Grand Tour
this week to Canada.

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,080
No, we didn't.

29
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,040
This was the meeting point we chose.

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,520
The Area 27 race track.

31
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,680
It was designed by F1 star
Jacques Villeneuve.

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,440
And it's a bit of a hidden gem.

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,080
And I'd be driving round it in this:

34
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,600
the new Alfa Romeo Stelvio.

35
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,960
There is no way in hell that
I would buy one of these

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,400
because the saloon on which it's based

37
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,200
is faster, cheaper, more economical

38
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,600
and nicer to drive,

39
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,720
but if I had to have an SUV...

40
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,200
This is what I'd choose.

41
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,200
At this point, May arrived

42
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,080
in the supercharged
V6 Range Rover Velar.

43
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,040
Well, you've done that wrong.

44
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,080
- No, I haven't.
- Mm.

45
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,560
Look, in the first season
of The Grand Tour,

46
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,600
we did a big test of three
large off-roaders.

47
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,320
You had a Range Rover and you went:

48
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,040
"You'd be mad not to have a Range Rover,

49
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,440
the Range Rover is literally the best."

50
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,240
So you can't then stand there
and say that it isn't.

51
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,920
What I meant when I said you'd got
it wrong, well, I meant two things.

52
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,160
One: you've picked the wrong one,
you should have had an Alfa,

53
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,440
and two: it's the wrong colour.

54
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,160
I saw one of those in London

55
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,880
the other day and it was silver,

56
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,880
and it's one of the best-looking
cars I've ever seen.

57
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,440
It is a very good-looking
car, yes, I agree.

58
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,120
Really good-looking.
That's just hideous.

59
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,240
That looks like it's got a
glovebox full of K and MDF...

60
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,560
What, building materials?

61
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,080
No, not MDF. What do I mean?
What is it? I don't know.

62
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,520
- MDMA.
- MDMA. Director knew that, weirdly.

63
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,920
Anyway, never mind that.

64
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,800
What that is is a Range Rover

65
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,840
that sits between the Evoque
and the Range Rover Sport.

66
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,000
I thought the Disco sat there.

67
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,600
No, that sits over to one side.

68
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,080
No, the Discovery Sport sits
between the Evoque and the...

69
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,800
- No, wait.
- No, the Discovery Sport...

70
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,200
- Hang on, you've got Evoque.
- Yes.

71
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,320
Discovery Sport off to one side.

72
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,600
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

73
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,560
- Why is it?
- Because that's the serious off-roady bit, not the...

74
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,800
It's not serious!

75
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,960
Before we had a
chance to get to the bottom

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,480
of Land Rover's very
complicated line-up,

77
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,280
Richard Hammond
arrived in a Porsche Macan.

78
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,560
Wow, Hammond, that is modern.

79
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,880
Yeah, that's where you're wrong.

80
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,160
He's making a habit of that.

81
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,040
This is the new Porsche Macan
Turbo Performance Pack.

82
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,520
You get 40 horsepower
more than the standard Turbo,

83
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,040
so it makes 434 in total.

84
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,160
- I'm sorry, 434?
- Yeah, in there, yes.

85
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,000
And you managed to make it move?

86
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,960
- Why?
- 505!

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,040
Italian horses.

88
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,000
Which, let's face it,
a flock of Italian horses

89
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,880
could go from Shire to Shetland.

90
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,480
- These are German horses...
- How many torques?

91
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,160
- 442.
- 443.

92
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,560
Oh, right. One more.

93
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,800
Well, it's too many for a car on stilts.

94
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,000
- This isn't!
- It's high, that, isn't it?

95
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,640
What do you mean? Of course it's high!

96
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,840
It looks like somebody's startled it!

97
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,200
It's an SUV!

98
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,480
At this point,

99
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,320
we decided to get on with testing

100
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,840
the "S" part of our SUVs,
the sporty bit.

101
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,000
We began by sending
a BMW M3 sport saloon

102
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,400
round the track to get a benchmark time.

103
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,360
It's a really, really good race track.

104
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,480
"Good race track"
is like saying "fun fair",

105
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,680
it's just a contradiction.

106
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,440
James, I think most of our viewers
would disagree with you on that.

107
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,720
I dunno.

108
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,280
- Here it comes.
- Here it is, and...

109
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,880
Two minutes 26 seconds,

110
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,600
and James May will
now fail to match that

111
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,560
in his Range Rover Velar.

112
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,000
James was soon ready to go,

113
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,240
but there was a problem.

114
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,640
Can you hear me in the BMW?

115
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,480
Could we have the brown
BMW get off the track?

116
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,840
Saying the key isn't in the car.

117
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,720
- Well, how did he do a lap?
- I don't know.

118
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,800
Because if it was keyless,
if somebody got out

119
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,440
with the key and it was running...

120
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,680
- No, no, cos they stop.
- No, they don't.

121
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,880
What?

122
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,000
Course they don't, cos otherwise
it'd just stop on the motorway.

123
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,280
What they won't do is restart.

124
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,440
All the while this is going on,
I'm forgetting the track.

125
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,240
You go down here and you go left,

126
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,760
and then it's a fog.

127
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,280
Who has the key?

128
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,280
Come on, one of you
has been near the BMW.

129
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,840
Where's the key? Have you
checked your pockets?

130
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,080
With the key nowhere to be found,

131
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,520
there was only one solution.

132
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,120
Ditch the health and safety
and get on with it anyway.

133
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,480
And he's off!

134
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,960
Right, compared with Pinky and Perky

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,520
I have the least power,
the least torque,

136
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,800
I have the least impressive
0-60 time and top speed,

137
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,200
but I do have the mostest
number of gears at eight,

138
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,760
so that's nice and confusing.

139
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,760
What happens here? No idea.

140
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,560
You know, one of the reasons why
that thing is gonna be very slow

141
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,360
is because of who's driving it.

142
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,960
Yeah, it's cause and effect.

143
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,120
Now in bigger Range Rovers
the power is split 50-50

144
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,400
between the front and rear wheels.

145
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,920
On this one, it's biased
more towards the back

146
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,920
which is, of course, very sporty.

147
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,280
But it will put some to the front

148
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,640
when you're off-road,
and you need traction, or...

149
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,680
Oh, God.

150
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,200
When I cock it up.

151
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,080
Do you know what he did last weekend?

152
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,520
He took his girlfriend across London
to the Victoria and Albert Museum

153
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,760
to look at an exhibition of plywood.

154
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,440
How good was that?

155
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,760
Next up, Richard "Lucky" Hammond.

156
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,760
His wife's already telephoned
him this morning,

157
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,080
said if he goes round the corner with
any tyre squeal, she's divorcing him.

158
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,480
Three, two, one. Go!

159
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,920
And we're away.

160
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,920
Whoa!

161
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,960
Minding the BMW on arriving
at this first turn.

162
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,880
No tyre squeal.

163
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,440
This is the only one of the three

164
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,600
that has a proper dual-clutch gearbox.

165
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,160
The other two are just
old-school slushmatics.

166
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,240
So it does change like a race car.

167
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,480
Ooh, did you hear that?

168
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,240
- Nice little sporty noise.
- Yeah.

169
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,440
There is no doubt this thing
can talk the talk.

170
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,880
It's got dry sump, active aero,

171
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,240
but it's all wrapped up
in the wrong body.

172
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,560
Huge amount of lean, I mean...

173
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,840
Scrabbling for grip.

174
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,920
Those squeals from the tyres
are in protest, not for joy.

175
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,640
Hammond breaking his record,
completing a lap without a crash.

176
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,600
Finally, it was the turn of the Stelvio.

177
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,840
Three, two, one. Go!

178
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,760
Oh, well, that's just a flying start.

179
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,960
And he's hit the BMW.

180
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,880
The twin turbo-charged
V6 engine in this thing...

181
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,920
Well, it's a masterpiece,
there's no other word.

182
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,000
The body's made from aluminium.

183
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,800
The prop shaft is made
from carbon fibre.

184
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,960
This has all the ingredients
of a full-on racer.

185
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,760
And it is quick. Easily
the quickest car here.

186
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,160
0-60, 3.9 seconds.

187
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,680
Top speed, 177.

188
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,080
In an SUV!

189
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,440
In a straight line, it would
leave even the M3 for dead.

190
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,760
But this circuit isn't a straight line.

191
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,600
Which causes a few problems.

192
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,800
Oh, chief among which is the steering.

193
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,960
It's as fast as the steering
you get in the saloon car

194
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,120
and it is too quick
in a car of this type.

195
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,600
It... (BLEEP) hell!

196
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,720
See what I mean?

197
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,720
Tiniest little movement of the wheel
and it's darting all over the place.

198
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,960
Couple that to the wobbly
long travel suspension

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and it all gets a bit haywire.

200
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,640
Whoa!

201
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,680
- That was rubbish!
- What was that?

202
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,640
And across the line.

203
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,920
After that fast but messy lap,

204
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,320
it was time to review the times.

205
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,480
BMW, two minutes 26.

206
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,240
Range Rover, three minutes two.

207
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:29,240
Porsche, 2.46, you're only 20
seconds slower than the M3.

208
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,120
Alfa Romeo, 2.40.

209
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,920
Six seconds faster
than the Porsche Turbo

210
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,680
which proves, conclusively,

211
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,280
that the most sporty of three
completely un-sporty vehicles

212
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,120
is the Alfa Romeo.

213
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,240
- Yes.
- Right.

214
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,960
Onwards, to the next part of our test.

215
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,840
Which was to find out
how utilitarian they are.

216
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,000
We're gonna do this
by seeing which one of us

217
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,080
can get the most amount of
dogs in the boot of our car.

218
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,000
- Hammond, you idiot.
- What?

219
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,160
What are they?

220
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,400
If you say "dog" in Canada,
these are what you get.

221
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,000
- Newfoundlands!
- Hammond, they're enormous.

222
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,440
They're not dogs, they're cattle.

223
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,240
Yep...

224
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,720
Oh, they're having sex behind you.

225
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,360
Oh, there's dog sex. There's
actual dog sex going on.

226
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,160
- Dog sex. We don't need to see this.
- Maybe we should...

227
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,520
In a brief break from the mating,
we got on with the test.

228
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,760
- Up you go! Come on!
- Come on!

229
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,560
Up! In the car! Come on, it's a
new Range Rover! Come on, dog!

230
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,000
Right. Erm, there's... No. No.

231
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,240
I've got... Up we go. In we go.

232
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,960
The dog has never been in a
car and doesn't want to go in one.

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,640
Right. Sit.

234
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,440
Getting another dog.

235
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,320
Dog beer.

236
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,560
Ow.

237
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,440
Yes! Stay.

238
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,080
Ahem! The Alfa Romeo, not
only the sportiest vehicle,

239
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,280
but, as you can see, perfectly capable

240
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,560
of handling a brace of dogs.

241
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,040
Oh.

242
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,440
Yeah, the problem is, you
know electric tailgates...

243
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,080
If they sense anything, they'll open.

244
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,360
Yes, that's what's...

245
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,280
- So you can't actually close...
- Never gonna stay in, is it?

246
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,400
Oh! Biggest dog here is in.

247
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,440
Yeah, but you try closing,
OK, close your boot, then.

248
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,400
Go on, then.

249
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,280
You see, it won't close
cos it's electric.

250
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,520
All we've established, then, so far

251
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,960
is that these cars are
nowhere near as fast

252
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,320
as an ordinary car around a race track.

253
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,080
That you cannot put
a medium-sized dog in them

254
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,080
because of the electric tailgate

255
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,680
and you'll damage them cos they've
all got painted rear ends

256
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,960
and carpeted boot floors.

257
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,920
And that concludes another
important test. I'm sorry!

258
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,920
We then went for a short drive

259
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,400
to the location for our third test.

260
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,280
How well our cars worked as vehicles.

261
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,240
Now to do this, we are going to see

262
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,480
whether our cars
are better than a horse.

263
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,360
And here comes the horse now.

264
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,440
It's being ridden by someone
called Meinie Kampf.

265
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,640
- It's Maddie.
- What?

266
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,080
It's Maddie.

267
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,280
Yes, Maddie, Meinie's something
completely different.

268
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,240
Do you know, my Range Rover is better
than that horse in every single way.

269
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,640
- Ah, but is it?
- Yes, it is.

270
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,960
- Is it?
- Well, yes it is,

271
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,840
because it doesn't jig around a bit
when you're trying to get in it.

272
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,200
It doesn't set off on its own
at maximum speed.

273
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,600
It doesn't veer off to one
side to eat something

274
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,400
or sniff another Range Rover's arse.

275
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,600
Yes, good. Thing is, though,
we're trying to find out now

276
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,280
whether our cars are faster
than this horse in this arena.

277
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,560
This is barrel racing.

278
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,120
A sport for cowboy girls,

279
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,720
the idea is that you ride round three
barrels as fast as possible...

280
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,920
..while wearing Wrangler jeans.

281
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,280
Her time was 22.69 seconds.
That's what she did it in.

282
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,240
I shall now go and
beat it in my Porsche.

283
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,840
Well, this is what roads look
like where Hammond lives.

284
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,800
All of this is like his garden.

285
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,600
Broken tractor, knackered old caravan...

286
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,960
Rusty fence...

287
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,920
It's as if we've come
to Hammond's house.

288
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,040
Soon, I was in position
and preparing for the off.

289
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,160
Right, to do this I need Sport Plus...

290
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,120
Firm suspension...

291
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,520
No ride height...

292
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,000
Traction control off...

293
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:14,560
OK, in three, two, one... Go!

294
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,280
And we're off!

295
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,200
Barrel racing, so, I've gotta get round
this one first of all, on my right.

296
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,680
I'm already going
much faster than the horse.

297
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,960
Left now.

298
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,840
What?

299
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,400
He's stuck.

300
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,320
A four-wheel drive overload!

301
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,120
What?

302
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,400
Oh, it's gone into limp home mode!

303
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,720
This is the most lamentable spectacle!

304
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,480
Can I do it again?

305
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,920
No, don't let him do it again.

306
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,520
No, you can't have another go.

307
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,480
That was your time,
and it was 48.7 seconds,

308
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,160
which means that car, it's not
even half as good as a horse.

309
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,400
Next, it was May's turn in the Velar.

310
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,600
Three, two, one, go!

311
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,920
He's not lost. Actually, I
really did think he'd be lost.

312
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,280
- Oh, God, he's gonna beat me.
- Come on.

313
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,280
Oh, no! Look, he can't find the fence.

314
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,120
What is he... He can't find the fence!

315
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,640
What the hell is this?

316
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,840
Come on.

317
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,520
What's the time? Please tell
me he's quicker than you.

318
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,160
40.78.

319
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,000
- Would you like to jump off the back here?
- Yes.

320
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,640
Finally, it was my turn,

321
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,960
and I'd had a brilliant idea.

322
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,440
This is what those two didn't realise.

323
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,960
Use the handbrake, fight
the turnaround on the up.

324
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,040
In three, two, one, go.

325
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,680
There it is!

326
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,520
Ready for the handbrake?

327
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,360
Here it comes!

328
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,600
Oh.

329
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,120
He's gone to put the handbrake on,

330
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,120
but it's an electronic handbrake
so it just stops dead.

331
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,680
The electric handbrake is as
useless as the electric tailgate!

332
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,680
Oh, no!

333
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,440
No, I'm in limp home!

334
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,120
Service ATV system,
everything has failed!

335
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,920
Virtually parked.

336
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,160
This is it flat out.

337
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,040
Foot hard down, barely moving.

338
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,440
That looks utterly feeble.

339
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,680
He's still not out. And... He's out.

340
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,880
Damn you!

341
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,320
- What's the time?
- You did it...

342
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,640
- Yes.
- ...in...

343
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,080
Yes.

344
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,640
...45.44!

345
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,320
- So James May was the fastest?
- Yes.

346
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,680
- And then I was the second fastest?
- Yes.

347
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,520
And, with that test completed,

348
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,040
it was time for our conclusion.

349
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,240
We've proved that SUVs are no good

350
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,520
at sport or utility stuff.

351
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,200
And that if you want a vehicle,

352
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,160
you're better off with a horse.

353
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,320
And with that, back to the tent.

354
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,440
- Hang on.
- It was important work.

355
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,120
Thing is, we thought that
we'd finished at that point,

356
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,000
but Mr Willman had other ideas,

357
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,400
so we're gonna be
picking that up later on.

358
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,640
Yes, we shall.

359
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,520
However, now it's time to
step in a dog turd of chat

360
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,800
on Conversation Street.

361
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,680
Ow. Aargh. Ow.

362
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,440
Ooh. Ow. Ow. Ooh.

363
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,040
It was a good day, that.

364
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,640
Now, I wanna stick, if I may,
for a minute or two, on SUVs

365
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,680
because 25 percent of all new cars

366
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,800
sold in Britain these days are SUVs.

367
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,960
And the thing is, I was
working out the other day

368
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,440
why so many people buy them.

369
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,800
And I've worked it out.

370
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,760
See, if you were in
a hatchback or a saloon

371
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,080
and you see an SUV - which is larger -
coming towards you,

372
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,800
you think, "If we have an accident,

373
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,040
"I'm gonna come off worse.

374
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,880
"So I'd better have one, too."

375
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,200
They're like nuclear weapons.

376
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,880
Once one person's got one,
everyone's gotta have one.

377
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,680
Next thing you know, Kim Jong-Un's got
one, and then it's all a disaster.

378
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,080
But the fact remains,
everybody has them or not,

379
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,280
they are really silly.

380
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,480
The moment we asked
that Alfa and that Porsche

381
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,960
to do a tiny bit of off-roading

382
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,240
in that horse arena,

383
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,800
they just panicked and gave up
and went into limp home mode.

384
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,960
I actually think they might have
too much electronic stuff on them.

385
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,560
They do. The four-wheel-drive
system's all idiotic,

386
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,320
and then the handbrake, that
doesn't work, and the tailgate.

387
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,000
I mean, how do you actually
load a dog into a car?

388
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,640
I dunno. I mean, you can't...

389
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,840
If you put your hand in
to hold the dog back,

390
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,280
then it's gonna detect your arm.

391
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,920
You'd have to go round and
hold the dog against the seat.

392
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,320
But then you can't close the boot.

393
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,600
I know. And also,
while you're walking round,

394
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,560
the dog's left on its own in
a boot with an open tailgate.

395
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,400
What you're doing is
asking a dog to stay alone

396
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,240
in a room that's getting smaller.

397
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,880
It's not gonna do it,
it's gonna run away.

398
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,960
There is no solution to this
that I can think of.

399
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,640
There is a way to do it.

400
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,760
You'd have to put your dog in the boot,

401
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,360
shoot it with a tranquiliser dart,

402
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,880
so that it went out for a bit.

403
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,400
Well, yes, James, you could do that

404
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,840
or you could buy a car with
a manually closing boot lid.

405
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,280
Yeah, which would be cheaper,
lighter, faster and easier.

406
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,200
So, that's covered that. Don't
buy SUVs, they're stupid.

407
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,240
But we have got more on them later on.

408
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,000
I've got a bit of conversation.

409
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,680
- Is it about iambic pentameters?
- No.

410
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,400
- Is it about the Embraer 190?
- No.

411
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,120
- Is it about plywood?
- No.

412
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,160
- What is it about?
- It's about vans.

413
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,760
- Is it?
- Yes.

414
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,840
Because I borrowed
a transit van the other day

415
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,320
and the amazing thing about it is,

416
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,840
it's got all the equipment
you'd expect on a posh car,

417
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,240
including those sensing headlights
that dip automatically.

418
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,600
So when they see lights coming the
other way, they automatically dip,

419
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,800
but they also dip if they
see a reflective road sign.

420
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,360
Oh, I know, that's unbelievable,

421
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,800
cos it blinds you, cos they've dipped.

422
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,360
And now you can't
see where you're going,

423
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,400
as you approach a sign warning
you of a hazard ahead

424
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,360
which you then can't see.
No, they are stupid.

425
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,360
Here comes a really
dangerous right-hand bend.

426
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,280
- I'll just turn the lights off so you can't see it.
- They do do that.

427
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
But apart from that, I have to say,

428
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,960
the Ford Transit van long wheel-base,

429
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,320
is absolutely brilliant.

430
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,280
Much better than any SUV
and half the price.

431
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,600
And the amazing thing is, you can get
absolutely tonnes in the back of it.

432
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,880
Well, yeah, James. It's a van.
It's kinda what it's for.

433
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,960
The one problem with it was, I found,

434
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,400
is that when you load a van,
you have to get out.

435
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,720
You don't step out, you
sort of do a little jump...

436
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,720
No, I don't do a little jump. I just...

437
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,880
You do a little jump,
but what I didn't think of

438
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,040
was that I had my big parka on,

439
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,400
and as I jumped out,
the hood caught on the roof

440
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,760
and I actually hanged
myself pretty much as I...

441
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,280
If you actually had hung yourself,

442
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,760
we'd have put out a press release

443
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
saying that you'd died
in an autoerotic accident.

444
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,160
- Yeah, we would.
- Thank you.

445
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,560
- Did you have an orange in your mouth?
- No, I didn't.

446
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,880
You would have done
in our version of events.

447
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,560
You'd have been wearing a fur-lined
anorak and nothing else.

448
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,920
When you were found by police.

449
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,440
Bet you wish you hadn't started
that conversation now.

450
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,720
Now, we get quite
a few letters asking us

451
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,640
why we never review
anything made by Tesla.

452
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,280
Mm, very simple, actually.

453
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,400
Many years ago, I gave
a firm but fair review

454
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,800
to the Roadster -
picture of that one there.

455
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,120
- Yep, and Tesla sued.
- Yes, they did.

456
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,160
And they lost. And then they
appealed and they lost that.

457
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,840
Which is all fine, but being sued
is a massive pain in the arse.

458
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,800
It keeps you awake
at night, really stressy.

459
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,840
So I thought I will never, ever review
another Tesla as long as I live,

460
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,400
I shall simply ignore them.

461
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,080
However, Tesla is on the brink of
becoming a mainstream manufacturer.

462
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,000
They reckon that
by the end of this year,

463
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,400
they'll be bigger than Volvo.

464
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,280
Mm. So I couldn't really
ignore them any more.

465
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,640
Which is why I decided to
test the new Model X, OK?

466
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,480
Because I thought this might
actually be an SUV we all like.

467
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,560
With its bobby-dazzler back doors,

468
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,280
this doesn't look like
a normal family SUV,

469
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,960
it looks better.

470
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,200
Especially on the inside.

471
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,840
And it's more practical, too.

472
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,080
Because you have seating for seven,

473
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,160
a boot at the back that's big
enough for an owl sanctuary,

474
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,800
and then another boot at the front,

475
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,280
because, of course, it's
electric so there's no engine.

476
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,320
Most of all, though,
I'm intrigued by this car

477
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,680
because it represents a whole
new way of thinking about...

478
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,920
What a car actually is.

479
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,800
Take this enormous command and
control screen as an example.

480
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,240
It does all the usual stuff:

481
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,400
navigation, music,
connectivity and so on,

482
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,560
and so much more besides.

483
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,680
For example, if I want, I can
turn it into a sketchpad.

484
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,360
Then I can just draw pretty patterns

485
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,840
and so on as I go along.

486
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,040
Or, if I'm bored with being
in - where am I here? -

487
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,960
there you are, Swindon, which I am,

488
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,440
I can change it so that I become...

489
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,960
On Mars! Look at that,
I'm actually on Mars.

490
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,280
I mean, I'm not there, obviously,

491
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,600
but it says I am and that's fun!

492
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,360
Ooh, and this is a good one.

493
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,440
If you don't want to see the car
you're driving depicted on the screen,

494
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,480
you can change it so that it becomes...

495
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,480
Bond's Lotus.

496
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,480
That is actually quite funny.

497
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Of course, you may think all of this

498
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,920
might be a bit of a distraction
when you're driving.

499
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,200
Ah, well, now, you see,
that's the thing.

500
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,160
Because if I pull
this lever here twice...

501
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,320
I get a bong to tell me
I've engaged the autopilot,

502
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,600
which means I'm not driving.

503
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,800
It is.

504
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,720
Seriously, it's doing it all by itself.

505
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,800
Legally, cars aren't allowed
to drive around by themselves

506
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,280
but this is getting awfully close

507
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,600
because it's reading
the white lines in the road

508
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,920
and then simply sticking between them.

509
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,320
Then if I want to change lanes,

510
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,320
I don't have to bother with any of that
mirror, signal, manoeuvre nonsense,

511
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,400
you just put the indicator on...

512
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,200
And if it's safe to pull out, it does.

513
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,280
Put the indicator on to pull back
into the central lane and...

514
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,680
That's just astonishing!

515
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,280
All of this means that I can drive along

516
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,120
writing important messages
on my sketchpad.

517
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,280
Because I know that if the car in
front slows down, I'll slow down.

518
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,800
If it speeds up, I'll speed up.

519
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,560
If the traffic stops, I'll stop.

520
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Honestly, this is...

521
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,560
the most relaxing thing
I've ever driven.

522
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,840
Cos all I have to do is sit here.

523
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,240
Unless, of course, I can't
be bothered to do even that.

524
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,480
OK, the car is over there

525
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,200
and I literally can't be
arsed to walk to it.

526
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,720
So, take out my phone,
put it in summon mode,

527
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,560
connecting to vehicle and...

528
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,840
Here we go.

529
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,520
Look at that!

530
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,320
I mean, it can't extricate
itself from a parking space

531
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,880
or come to you from
the other side of town,

532
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,520
so it is only a gimmick.

533
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,520
But what's wrong with a gimmick?

534
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,720
That's brilliant!

535
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,960
And... Stop!

536
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,960
But what's it like if
you do actually drive it?

537
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,760
Well, because it's electric,
it's quiet, obviously.

538
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,920
Eerily quiet.

539
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,560
Stupidly quiet. Too quiet,
as they say in the movies.

540
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,200
It's also heavy because
of its massive battery pack.

541
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,760
However, because
it's mounted under the floor,

542
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,280
the centre of gravity is very low down.

543
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,880
And because you've got one electric motor
at the front running the front wheels

544
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,880
and one at the back
driving the back wheels...

545
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,120
..the car feels nimble and agile.

546
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,640
Feels good.

547
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,600
So, you're thinking it's
a fun-filled family car

548
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,200
with show-off doors and lots of
stuff to excite your inner child,

549
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,760
but that there's nothing here
for the enthusiastic motorist.

550
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,000
Hm...

551
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,920
Not so fast on that one...

552
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,680
Because what I'm gonna do now

553
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,120
is drag race this family SUV

554
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,360
against a mid-engine, V10-powered

555
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,440
600 horsepower Audi R8.

556
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,240
Right, before I do this

557
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,280
I'm going to engage what's
called "Ludicrous Mode".

558
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,320
There we are.
Hold on, I've got a choice.

559
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,040
"Do you wanna do this?"
"No, I want my Mommy."

560
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,520
"Yes, bring it on!" There we are.

561
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,720
And then, because I have the
mental age of a nine-year-old,

562
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,440
I'm going to use the warp speed graphic.

563
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,880
And there it is!

564
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,600
Right, good. I'm ready.

565
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,440
Sweet Jesus!

566
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,760
That really is properly ludicrous!

567
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,040
A hundred miles an hour!

568
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,200
105, 110...

569
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,920
112, the Audi's coming!

570
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,760
But not fast enough!

571
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,920
That is astonishing!

572
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,640
Small wonder this thing is fitted

573
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,840
with my favourite mode of
them all - celebration mode.

574
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,680
There we are. All I have to
do now is put it in park,

575
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,080
get out and lock the doors.

576
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,160
Watch this.

577
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,080
So, this may be a two-and-a-half tonne,

578
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,920
seven-seater PlayStation,

579
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,240
but it'll do 0-60 in 3.1 seconds

580
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,000
and has a top speed of 155.

581
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:44,040
So it really does seem
to be all things to all men.

582
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,640
It's serious and light-hearted.

583
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,880
It's sensible and daft.

584
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,160
It doesn't feel like anything else.

585
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,960
It doesn't go like anything else.

586
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,240
It's fabulous.

587
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,400
There are, however, some drawbacks.

588
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,280
But before talking about those,

589
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,240
Mr Willman said I should
fill the remaining six seats

590
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,800
with a team of lawyers.

591
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,520
First thing I wanna talk about is range,

592
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,720
because Tesla say this will
do 351 miles between charges.

593
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,000
But, in my experience, electric
cars never do the range...

594
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,760
How extensive is
your experience, Jeremy?

595
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,240
How many electric cars have you driven?

596
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,120
- Two.
- Ah.

597
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,480
Both of them failed to do the range

598
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,120
that the manufacturer
said they would do.

599
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,880
Cos it depends on temperature,

600
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,680
it depends on a million
things, and anyway...

601
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,520
As you've said, legally we need
to make very clear, it depends.

602
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,160
It depends on the conditions.

603
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,320
Most people are not driving
like a maniac like you.

604
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,520
I'm not. I'm doing 34 miles an hour.

605
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,320
At the moment.

606
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,480
So that we're clear,
we completely accept

607
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,840
that this car can do 351 miles
between charges, don't we?

608
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,600
I don't know, I haven't tried it.

609
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,800
I think we should accept that
if that's what Tesla says

610
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,760
and we don't have any
evidence to the contrary.

611
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,720
What, you just take what a car
manufacturer says as being gospel?

612
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,640
Vauxhall says its cars are exciting.

613
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,280
I wouldn't wish to contradict
them on television

614
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,400
unless we had strong
evidence to the contrary.

615
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,440
Suggesting a claim by
the manufacturer is untrue

616
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,520
is not where we're going
to go today, is it?

617
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,720
All right, then. Batteries.

618
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,680
We on this show have some experience

619
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,840
of electrical fires in a crash.

620
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,400
And this has the same sort of
batteries that the Rimac had.

621
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,160
Yeah, that was in a crash, wasn't it?

622
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,640
Drove off an edge and
rolled down two hillsides.

623
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,200
You're saying Richard Hammond was too
small to see over the steering wheel?

624
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,760
I'm not saying anything,

625
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,320
I'm just saying that that was a crash.

626
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,040
What people don't understand

627
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,440
is that if you crash an electrical car,

628
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,640
and it has lithium-ion
batteries, it could catch fire.

629
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,640
And often, the fire brigade will turn up

630
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,960
and they've only got water on board,

631
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,200
so as you're sitting there, on fire,

632
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,080
you're then being electrocuted.

633
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,640
It's just something that's worth
bearing in mind, isn't it?

634
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,360
I think we should make it clear

635
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,240
that we're not suggesting
that these cars

636
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,680
have any inherent defect.

637
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,320
I mean, look what happened with
Samsung with their batteries.

638
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,480
We're not gonna start
defaming Samsung, are we?

639
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,400
I think the battery is a good analogy

640
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,640
for libel law and reviews generally,

641
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,880
in that it has to be balanced.

642
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,920
You must have the positive and
you must have the negative.

643
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,840
Shall we bear that in mind?

644
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,760
What we should bear in mind is that -
what I've just written on the screen.

645
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,840
I know an area we need to discuss.

646
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:33,080
I think the biggest drawback with this
car, actually, is the width of it.

647
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,120
It's so wide, 79 inches,

648
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,440
that it won't actually go
across Albert Bridge in London.

649
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,040
It really won't go across the bridge

650
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,120
or do you mean it won't go through a
width restriction, a road narrowing?

651
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,880
Right, so I have to say

652
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,840
this is too wide to fit through

653
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,480
the width restriction at the start,

654
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,760
and indeed finish, of Albert Bridge?

655
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,040
That's perfect.

656
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,120
There is, however,
one advantage to this size.

657
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,520
Especially in a supermarket car park

658
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,040
when your Model X is full of lawyers.

659
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,960
- It can be interpreted...
- No, no. Listen.

660
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,880
Mean what you say, say what
you mean, that's the law.

661
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,960
Just stay there, all right? Stay there.

662
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,920
OK. Got the phone.
Summon mode, forwards.

663
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,840
I'm sorry, that never
ceases to amaze me.

664
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,840
Little bit more, little bit more...

665
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,760
And... Stop!

666
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,240
Right, now they can't open the doors -

667
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,680
they're trapped -

668
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,480
which means they can't interfere

669
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,960
when I tell you this car's
really big drawback.

670
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,280
It's £156,000.

671
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,760
There is... a lot to like on that.

672
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,400
- Yeah.
- There's a lot to like.

673
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,960
Thing is, though,

674
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,080
is that an SUV that we all like?

675
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,400
No. Not at that price.

676
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,960
No, 156 is silly.

677
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,400
I do love some of the gimmicks.

678
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,640
Yeah, now, on that, I have to say, you
know the summon facility it's got on it?

679
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,760
That didn't always work.

680
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,600
And then there was
the business on the motorway

681
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,000
where it checks for traffic coming
behind before moving lanes.

682
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,440
How'd you find that?

683
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,840
Well, I can't say.

684
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,160
So I got a lawyer to write this for me.

685
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,000
Really?

686
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,440
It's my honest belief
that a driverless system

687
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,480
does not always behave as you'd expect

688
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,000
and when it doesn't,
it can be discomforting.

689
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,160
Discomforting?

690
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,840
However, I acknowledge and accept

691
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,880
that a number of external
factors can reasonably result

692
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,840
in a driverless car's decision
to deactivate self-driving,

693
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,920
including, but not limited to,

694
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,280
other cars on the road
unexpectedly accelerating.

695
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,680
- So...
- No.

696
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,640
- What?
- No, just...

697
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,560
For the avoidance of any doubt,

698
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,400
these personal observations
about driverless cars

699
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,640
are my honest opinion

700
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,400
and should not be
regarded as any statement

701
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,760
about the general safety, roadworthiness
or mechanical effectiveness

702
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,640
of this specific car
or any other Tesla vehicle.

703
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,520
It is bloody fast, though, isn't it?

704
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,800
- It really was!
- Really fast!

705
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,520
We actually put it round the Eboladrome.

706
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,080
It did a 1.29.06, which is the
same as a five-litre Mustang.

707
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,880
- It's quick, isn't it?
- It is quick.

708
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,480
But anyway, we must park the Tesla now

709
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,000
and move on to Celebrity Face Off!

710
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,400
Another important question,
and it's this.

711
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,600
Who is the world's fastest
golfing enthusiast?

712
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,360
Well, to find out,
would you please welcome

713
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,120
Rory McIlroy and Paris Hilton!

714
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,960
Look at this!

715
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,960
That is a surprise!

716
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Hello, chap, how are you? Have a seat.

717
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,480
Paris, lovely to see you, how are you?

718
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,720
- Great.
- Have a seat!

719
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,240
We're not messing around.

720
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,560
We are not messing around this week.

721
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,960
Now, you are both golf enthusiasts.

722
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,560
You obviously are, cos you're heavyweight
golfing champion of the world.

723
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,640
Sorta need to be, yeah.

724
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,520
You, more of a surprise,
but your family, of course,

725
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,040
does own 50 golf tracks, doesn't it?

726
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,440
Yes.

727
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,080
Or was it courses?
Courses, that's what it is.

728
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,080
Fifty golf... So you play
quite a bit of golf.

729
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,320
I'm not as good a golfer
as him, obviously.

730
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,920
As him? No, that figures.

731
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,920
But I have been playing since
I was around four years old.

732
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,240
The one area of golf I really
genuinely love are the golf carts.

733
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,920
Me too.

734
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,840
I don't think I've ever got out
of a fully functioning golf cart.

735
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,120
In my life, ever.

736
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,680
Cos I've always crashed them.

737
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,160
I don't know what it is
that makes you think:

738
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,720
"Right, I'm going to go a million."

739
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,520
You would like my golf cart because
I've got the restrictor taken off it

740
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,160
so it goes about 50 miles an hour.

741
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,680
- You're kidding.
- No, it does.

742
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,360
- That's sick.
- How much damage could I do with that?

743
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,960
You could do a lot.

744
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,200
I love the golf carts.

745
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,680
Actually, when I was a little girl,

746
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,280
my grandfather has

747
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,760
a Rolls Royce golf cart
and a Bentley one.

748
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,600
So my sister and I decided
that we wanted to race them.

749
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,920
So we're going around
the pond on the golf course

750
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,960
and going so fast,

751
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,080
I smashed the Rolls into this huge rock.

752
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,200
The entire thing was smashed,
it was totalled.

753
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,040
We were so scared, we just ran away.

754
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,960
And then later my grandpa's like,

755
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,240
"Where's the Rolls? I wanna
go golfing right now."

756
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,880
Stolen. Stolen is the answer.
That's what I always say.

757
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,680
Someone went and had a joyride in it.

758
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,480
I know one thing I wanted to
talk about is golfing slang.

759
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,280
- OK.
- Cos apparently

760
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,760
there's quite a bit of,
well, it's quite rude.

761
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,080
Are you familiar with this?

762
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,240
There's a Richard Hammond, I know that.

763
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,640
There's a Richard Hammond, which means

764
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,160
straight down the middle like a rocket,

765
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,560
then veers off into
the rough at the last minute.

766
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,800
Jamie Oliver, you really
wanna smack it but you can't.

767
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,520
I actually like Jamie Oliver,
make that quite plain.

768
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,080
This is not me, this is
just golfing people.

769
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,360
Ryanair. OK in the air but landed
miles from where you wanted it to be.

770
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,400
Right, shall we get on to cars?

771
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
Cos this is another thing
you two have in common.

772
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,240
Genuinely an astonishing collection
of cars that you both have.

773
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,200
You started, at the age
of 17, with a BMW.

774
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,160
Yeah, I had a 1 Series was my first car.

775
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,240
- Did that go well?
- Not very well, no.

776
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,600
I thought I was cool
having a BMW at that age,

777
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,880
just passed my test.

778
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,760
Tried to do some handbrake turns
in the golf club car park

779
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,120
and that didn't go so well.

780
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,960
Nearly actually drove it through
the front door of the golf club.

781
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,320
Hit a big, high kerb,
bent the steering axle

782
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,080
and I literally had
to drive it like this

783
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,240
to keep it straight for
the five miles I went home.

784
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,760
And I got back to my parents

785
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,600
and I said I had to swerve
to miss a fox and hit a kerb.

786
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,360
But, any girls watching, they
will have been impressed.

787
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,680
We've argued this many times.

788
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,720
When a girl sees a guy
do a handbrake turn,

789
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,440
it's like when a peacock
does that feather thing.

790
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,120
You say you're not interested,

791
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,480
but you are, aren't you?

792
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,600
- I think it's pretty hot.
- There you go.

793
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,800
First honest girl I've ever met.

794
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,040
So that was your 1 Series, and then you
moved up quickly, age 19, I think?

795
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,560
I won my first professional
golf tournament at 19

796
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,920
and I always thought the image
of success was a Ferrari,

797
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,000
so I bought a Ferrari at 19.

798
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,400
How the hell did you insure it?

799
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,880
The premium was quite high.

800
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,520
- Make it live for us.
- 25 grand a year.

801
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,640
You need to win a lot of golf.

802
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,800
Yeah, you do, yeah, yeah.

803
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,760
And did that kindle a love of Ferraris?

804
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,160
It did, yeah. And I always knew
that you've loved Ferraris

805
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,920
and the reason that I have the
cars that I have at the minute,

806
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,240
I saw you test drive
the F12 that I have.

807
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,680
Oh, the F12? That's a scary car.

808
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,160
- Yeah.
- You've got an F12 now?

809
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,160
That's a really, that's almost too fast.

810
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,720
And didn't you get a LaFerrari?

811
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,920
I've got a LaFerrari, yeah.

812
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,920
No, cos why did you go for a
LaFerrari and not a P1,

813
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,160
which I proved on this show was better?

814
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,400
I would have killed myself
in a P1, I think.

815
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,360
The P1 is nuts, but they are brilliant.

816
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,400
- I mean, the LaFerrari is also...
- It's incredible.

817
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,240
I haven't taken the LaFerrari on a track

818
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,280
like what we obviously did today,

819
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,080
and I don't know if I'd want to.

820
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,360
I'd be so scared
of flipping it or rolling it.

821
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,200
That's where it belongs, on a track.

822
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,680
I know, I just... I'm scared.

823
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,400
That's an impressive car collection.

824
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,080
Well, not really a collection,

825
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,840
but two really super-fast Ferraris.

826
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,080
But yours is not far behind,
cos you've got a McLaren.

827
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,840
Yes.

828
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,480
- 650, yeah?
- I love it.

829
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,160
I think it's just such a sexy car.

830
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,040
It is. And then, and
I really hate to say this,

831
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,520
my favourite car in the whole
wide world, you also own.

832
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,120
Which is slightly murderous, actually,
is the word I'm looking for.

833
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,800
You've got a Lexus LFA.

834
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,200
I actually got the second one
they ever made.

835
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,600
- Really?
- So I was so excited.

836
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,760
And just driving on the street,

837
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,400
no one had ever seen it before

838
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,400
so they looked at it
like a UFO or something.

839
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,560
That is definitely a head-turner.

840
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,360
Didn't you drive a Bentley every day?

841
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,520
Yes, I actually had
a Bentley custom-made

842
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,000
so it's all baby pink
with crystals on it.

843
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,360
- Oh, wow, that's...
- There you go.

844
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,880
It's very pink. I used
to drive it all the time,

845
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,280
but when I drive it, it's literally
like Mickey Mouse at Disneyland.

846
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,120
People are pulling over on the freeway.

847
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,600
- I wonder why.
- Taking selfies.

848
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,360
It causes, like, accidents almost,

849
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,840
so I try to keep it at home now.

850
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,760
Anyway, listen. You obviously
came to do your laps.

851
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,720
There's no snow this week, which is
good, but it's still quite greasy.

852
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,560
- It was icy.
- Yeah, it was a little greasy.

853
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,800
Icy and greasy, so we're not gonna
be looking for a record time today.

854
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,600
And you were seriously
pushing it, by all accounts.

855
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,960
I was. I love driving fast.

856
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,960
And I love when there's no cops
around to pull me over, so it's...

857
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,880
Exactly. Well, anybody wanna see an
outtake of Paris trying really hard?

858
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,280
Let's have a look.
This is the last corner,

859
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,120
which you've gotta slow down for.

860
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,680
Which we obviously never told
the poor girl, here we go.

861
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,520
Shit!

862
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,600
That's a properly big one,
and well done.

863
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,000
Thanks.

864
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,120
You did have a problem, apparently,
with that last corner?

865
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,520
Because I just wanted
to go so fast at the end

866
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,840
and then just making that right...

867
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,400
You've gotta slow
right down to get round.

868
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,920
I thought I was gonna flip over,

869
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,520
I was actually really
scared at that point.

870
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,480
Would anybody like
to see Paris's actual lap?

871
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,080
Yes!

872
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,760
Let's play the tape!

873
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,640
Yep, that's an aggressive start.

874
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,040
Let's go!

875
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,240
OK, the first S.

876
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,160
Ooh, beautifully done,
keeping it very tidy.

877
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,600
I like to brake there.

878
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,720
Was that left foot braking?
Probably not. That's panic braking.

879
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,480
Ooh, I say, that's the tail out, there.

880
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,080
On to the difficult bit.

881
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,520
And how are we gonna handle this?

882
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:04,080
First right, wide, but nicely held.

883
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,600
And completely off the track.

884
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,640
But that's OK, back on it again now.

885
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,480
(BLEEP) rocks!

886
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,720
The what-ing rocks?

887
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,680
Ooh, that's some
family-friendly words there.

888
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,680
Through the gravel cell,
still looking tidy,

889
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,520
not necessarily the wrong
thing to do, keeping it tidy.

890
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,880
Ooh, that's wild.

891
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,240
And now trying to get in shape,

892
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,160
ready to go back on the tarmac.

893
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,440
I bet this was slippery, too.

894
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,880
Ooh, no, you've done that beautifully.

895
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,800
And then...

896
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,080
Right, now, round the final left

897
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,520
and on to the straight flat out.

898
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,240
Let's do it!

899
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,720
Now, this isn't your
tricky bit. This is now.

900
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,200
You've gotta start braking...

901
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,880
Now.

902
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,360
And do you?

903
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,760
Oh, yeah. That's heavy, that
was probably too much braking,

904
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,880
but there we are, anyway,
you've made it across the line.

905
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,360
Nicely done.

906
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,400
Good.

907
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,640
Looks good.

908
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,360
So what do you reckon,
then, now you've seen that?

909
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,000
Are you feeling nervous?

910
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,320
Yeah.

911
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,920
Anyone wanna see Rory's lap?

912
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,360
- Yeah!
- Yes!

913
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,280
Let's see if you chose the wrong sport.

914
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,600
Here we go.

915
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,200
Right, and we are underway.

916
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,960
Third, fourth.. Brake at the 50 board.

917
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,240
This is a man who's been listening
to the instructors, haven't you?

918
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,440
You can tell, that's nicely done.

919
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,760
Listening to the instructors
is always the key, really.

920
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,920
Most men think, "I can
go better than they do.

921
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,520
I know more than they do."

922
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,600
Right and... Holding it on.

923
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,480
Yeah, are we gonna take the Paris line?

924
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,240
No, we're gonna stick
on the actual track.

925
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,200
Ah, little bit. Don't let it
get too sideways, Rory!

926
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,640
Yep, that's beautifully
held through there.

927
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,560
Smooth power application, yep.

928
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,560
More of it. Should have done
this, you're in the wrong sport.

929
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,080
Ah, I dunno.

930
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,560
No, this is looking very good indeed.

931
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,480
Are we gonna be able to control it here?

932
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,000
Very nice in, keeping it to the right.

933
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,080
Which puts you in the right
place for that left.

934
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,800
You've managed to keep two tyres
on the track, so that's all right.

935
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,240
And off we go.

936
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,280
OK, come on, lift a little, turn in!

937
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,640
Probably not flat through there today.

938
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,240
It's too slippery, too icy.

939
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,000
Here's the corner
we were having trouble with.

940
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,400
This is the tricky one, the last corner.

941
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,480
Ooh, bit of understeer
but just keeping it...

942
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,880
Oh, no!

943
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,440
Just about made it across the line!

944
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,240
Oh, yeah.

945
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,160
So there we are.

946
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,520
Right, so just so you know,

947
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,280
I've got some times we've had.

948
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,440
Fastest so far 1:17, Kevin Pietersen.

949
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,600
Slowest, Dynamo, last week, 1.39.3.

950
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,000
But the track was two feet deep in snow

951
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,640
so he has got an excuse.

952
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,080
- Oh, my goodness.
- He does.

953
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,920
Got your times here.

954
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,920
Paris Hilton...

955
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,600
1.25.8.

956
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,640
So that puts you - have
a round of applause for that.

957
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,040
You're faster than two people
you've never heard of:

958
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:11,280
Alfie Boe and Bill Bailey are both, well,
round about that sort of time, OK?

959
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,720
1.25.8, that's the time you've gotta
beat on a greasy track, Rory.

960
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,600
One...

961
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,960
21...

962
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,720
- Ooh.
- ...point 9.

963
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,520
That is a very good time.

964
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,400
Very good time.

965
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,160
Faster than Hugh Bonneville.

966
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,360
- There you go.
- Faster than Hugh Bonneville, and he was on a dry track.

967
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,320
So that was extremely good.

968
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,080
- I can't thank you enough for coming, I really can't.
- Thank you for having us.

969
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,000
Pleasure to have you here.
Ladies and gentlemen,

970
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,480
Paris Hilton, and the world's fastest
golfing enthusiast, Rory McIlroy!

971
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,320
Now. Now.

972
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,080
Earlier on, we were in Canada,

973
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,480
where we proved that medium-sized SUVs

974
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,760
are useless at everything.

975
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:06,400
But Mr Willman said the tests
we'd done were idiotic.

976
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,240
Yeah, he said people actually
buy them to go canoeing

977
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,400
and hiking and mountain biking,

978
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,440
and he then also said
that we could only come home

979
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,360
once we'd completed one more challenge.

980
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,200
Why are we towing speedboats?

981
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,480
Never mind that, James.

982
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,320
Why have you bought a brown speedboat?

983
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,400
Er, it's orange.

984
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,240
Never mind James's brown speed boat,

985
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,400
where's your Alfa Romeo?

986
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,880
It was stolen.

987
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,640
- No, it wasn't.
- It was!

988
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,920
I came out of the hotel this morning,
it was just gone. Literally gone.

989
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,360
You know Canada is number one
in the world for car theft?

990
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,680
No, it isn't.

991
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,800
So what I've done is I've replaced it

992
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,880
with this Ford F150 pickup truck,

993
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,760
which is the best-selling
vehicle, not just in Canada,

994
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,040
but the entire world.

995
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,760
Yeah, but the fact is
you've replaced your Alfa

996
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,240
because we were told to tow speedboats

997
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,800
and you can't fit a towbar to a Stelvio.

998
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,320
The problem is that they've
routed the exhaust

999
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,680
on the Stelvio in such a way

1000
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,160
that you can't, actually, as
Hammond says, fit a towbar.

1001
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,480
I think the thing is,

1002
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,480
that in Italy it's unmanly and
undignified to tow something.

1003
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,080
I mean, why would they tow something?

1004
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,280
It just slows you down.

1005
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,240
Soon, we arrived at the start point

1006
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,360
for Mr Willman's challenge.

1007
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,920
Which was precisely
in the middle of nowhere.

1008
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,320
- James...
- What?

1009
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,720
This is a skip.

1010
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,640
No, it's just all stuff
that was thrown in.

1011
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,760
Literally thrown in, yeah.

1012
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,560
- It's all boat stuff.
- Is it? There's a traffic cone.

1013
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,600
Well, that's probably
something to do with boating.

1014
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,080
It isn't anything to do with boating!

1015
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,960
This is an oar and a boat suit and...

1016
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,080
- What are you doing?
- Looking for bears.

1017
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,440
Why?

1018
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,360
Because one of the things I don't
wanna be is eaten by a bear.

1019
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,640
I wouldn't worry about
being eaten by one.

1020
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,000
Well, I do.

1021
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,480
Well, they do far worse than that.

1022
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,240
Hang on, hang on, we have a message,

1023
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,120
and it's from Mr Willman.

1024
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,920
"Each of your cars has been
fitted with a satellite compass

1025
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,880
which will direct you
to the finish line.

1026
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,040
Whoever arrives first can
claim to have the best SUV."

1027
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,320
Well, that's me.

1028
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,360
Well, apart from you haven't got an SUV.

1029
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,080
It's got a twin turbo-charged V6 -

1030
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,400
same as the Alfa.

1031
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,120
Four-wheel drive, same as the Alfa.

1032
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,520
It's exactly the same colour.

1033
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,600
With all that
cleared up... the race began.

1034
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,960
Ah!

1035
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,680
Right, where are we now? There.

1036
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:51,680
My compass thing says I've
gotta go in that direction

1037
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,800
for 5.1 kilometres.

1038
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,960
How hard can that be?

1039
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,760
Come on, little Porsche, this is your
chance to show your off-road credentials.

1040
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,800
The Porsche is the only one with a
proper four-wheel drive system for this.

1041
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,200
It can divert all of its
power to the front wheels

1042
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,720
so it can scrabble its way
out of trouble like a dog,

1043
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,440
pulling itself with its front legs.

1044
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,720
Right. Typical of those two,
just roar off being brilliant.

1045
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,040
Let's have a look at the map first.

1046
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,360
Might just go straight up here.

1047
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,440
Through these nettles.

1048
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,840
What are they, Christmas trees?
I don't know what they are.

1049
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,800
If you really want to go off-road,

1050
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,600
you need a real off-roader.

1051
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,680
A Range Rover, a Land Cruiser, a Raptor.

1052
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,960
There's no point messing
around with a little SUV.

1053
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,240
It's not gonna go anywhere.

1054
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,640
Speaking of which...

1055
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,800
Oh, I'm stuck.

1056
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,000
I'm going backwards now.

1057
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:09,200
So I'm going west-northwest.
That's high terrain...

1058
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,720
That's very high, I want to avoid that.
I should try to...

1059
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,440
Come on, come on.

1060
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,000
Four-wheel drive overload,
rear-wheel drive only.

1061
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,680
Reduce engine load.

1062
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,360
It doesn't work!

1063
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,600
I need another route.

1064
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,320
James, meanwhile,
had sorted out his route

1065
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,800
and was now sorting out his car.

1066
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,640
I'm putting my response system
in grass, gravel and snow.

1067
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,160
It has just started snowing.

1068
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,480
I also have...

1069
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,520
Who the hell is that?

1070
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,520
It's Hammond, look,
he's got exactly nowhere.

1071
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,240
What a spanner.

1072
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,880
Anyway.

1073
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,880
With both my colleagues
still on the start line,

1074
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,320
I was winning by miles.

1075
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,320
This is a very narrow
little path, this one.

1076
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,280
I don't want to be
making a mess... Oh, hello.

1077
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,560
Right.

1078
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,880
What that is is a fallen-down tree.

1079
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,520
How the hell do you reverse a trailer?

1080
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,760
So if I turn the steering
wheel this way...

1081
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,760
This way.

1082
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,120
Yeah, I've got it, I've got it.

1083
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,320
This is a bit... No, not...

1084
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,640
Oh, shit, no! Ooh, God!

1085
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,800
Boat is still attached, correct.

1086
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,400
Direction, roughly right.

1087
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,440
Everything's excellent.

1088
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,760
Plenty of power, this is good.

1089
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,080
Right, arrow's pointing that way.

1090
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,280
Now we're making progress.

1091
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,400
I want to go... If I turn into the...

1092
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,120
No, this way.

1093
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,120
Oh, Christ, that's not right.

1094
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,920
Having carefully
unhitched the trailer...

1095
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,080
Right.

1096
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,280
I was soon turned round
and back on the move

1097
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,400
looking for another route.

1098
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,320
Trailers definitely
have an intelligence.

1099
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,760
They have a mind of their own
and it's a vindictive mind.

1100
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,480
It wants you to fail.

1101
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,760
And, thanks to its vindictiveness,

1102
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,680
all of my lead in this
important race was gone.

1103
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,840
Quite ballsy of Land Rover, really,

1104
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,600
to build a car that doesn't
have a low-ratio gearbox.

1105
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,960
But there is a lot of
electronically-controlled stuff.

1106
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,760
The central diff, for example,
it just locked for me then.

1107
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,560
I can feel it working stuff out,

1108
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,880
finding the grip on different wheels.

1109
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,200
And it works: look at that.

1110
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,360
My off-road work is exceptional.

1111
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,880
How long before James May says keep
your thumbs out of the steering wheel?

1112
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,400
It's all he knows about off-roading.

1113
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,400
Thumbs outside the steering
wheel in case it kicks.

1114
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,080
Mud ruts selected.

1115
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,880
Just because it's gone a bit slippery.

1116
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,800
But then, I too hit a dead end.

1117
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,040
Oh, cock.

1118
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,160
Right, trailer reversing tip,

1119
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,360
if I look in the mirror and I say
I want the boat to go that side,

1120
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,360
I lift that hand.

1121
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,640
So you look in the mirror.
So I'll do that...

1122
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,320
Right, well, I am getting closer

1123
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,960
according to my electronic compass.

1124
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,320
This is looking good.

1125
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,720
I've just gotta hope
they don't find this track.

1126
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,760
To be honest, in the Raptor,
I didn't need a track.

1127
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,960
I'm not a fan of pickup trucks

1128
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,240
and I will kill you if you ever
tell Richard Hammond this,

1129
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,840
but this is impressive.

1130
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,560
It's just drumming its
fingers coming along here.

1131
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,440
I mean, if I'd have asked it
to tow a battleship,

1132
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,240
maybe it would be struggling
a bit, but a speedboat? Pah.

1133
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,120
Yes! Well done you, little car!

1134
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,880
Do you know, I'm gonna win this.

1135
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,200
Oh, hang on a minute.

1136
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,880
This thing's telling me, it must
be the other side of the lake.

1137
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,520
I can see a flag.

1138
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,000
There's a flag. It's there.

1139
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,920
Clearly, it would be impossible

1140
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,960
to drive the Macan round the shoreline.

1141
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,280
So I needed to break out the
map and find another route.

1142
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,160
A track, a track, a track.
There will be one.

1143
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,800
Oh... Oh, good.

1144
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,760
Why've you stopped here?
Finish line's over there.

1145
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,920
Yes, I know, I'm just
working out how to get there!

1146
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,680
You just drive round the
outside, look, on the beach.

1147
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,320
I can't do that.

1148
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,080
That's cos you're in the wrong car.

1149
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,720
- No, you're in the wrong car.
- I'm not in the wrong car!

1150
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,360
You are!

1151
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,400
Rather than have a
pointless debate about this,

1152
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,920
I decided to let
the Raptor do the talking.

1153
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,560
Here we go. Oh, yep.

1154
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,200
Meanwhile, very far back,

1155
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,840
in a blizzard, on a hill,

1156
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,280
the Velar's electronics, predictably,

1157
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,360
were starting to struggle.

1158
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,280
Right, no traction launch. Activate.

1159
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,240
Doesn't like it.

1160
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,920
Oh, no!

1161
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,040
I've gotta be honest,
I'm a bit disappointed.

1162
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,480
I'm using absolutely everything on here.

1163
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,880
No.

1164
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,720
Come on. There you go.

1165
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,240
Oh! What's that big bump?

1166
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,520
This beach is woodier than I thought.

1167
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,480
But the speedboat is still
upright, and that's good.

1168
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,800
And round we go.

1169
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,920
Ooh. Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

1170
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,320
No! Bloody hell!

1171
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,480
Distance, reducing.

1172
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,520
Hill descent control
is automatically on.

1173
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,360
Controlling the speed with my thumb.

1174
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,480
It's excellent at going down
hills, this Range Rover.

1175
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,200
Not so sure about it going up them.

1176
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:53,080
Having righted the boat with
no help from any of the film crew...

1177
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,240
I was back on the move.

1178
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,080
Stop just dithering about.

1179
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,120
Ooh, God!

1180
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,440
Found it.

1181
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,120
This is what we need.

1182
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,560
Proper track. It's farther from
the lake, I'll have further to go

1183
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,920
but I can get a move on.

1184
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,680
Now we've got a race on our hands.

1185
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,600
Eventually, I arrived at the lake,

1186
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,840
but I wasn't worried
about how far back I was

1187
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,080
because I'd had an idea.

1188
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,400
That message from Mr Willman,

1189
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,680
it said the first person to get
to the finishing line, didn't it?

1190
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,360
- Is that right, director?
- Yes.

1191
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,080
The first person. Didn't
say anything about the car.

1192
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:47,560
So why don't I just unload
the boat and boat across?

1193
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,680
Meanwhile, I'd left the
difficult beach through a wood

1194
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,000
and was on a track with a problem.

1195
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,080
My vindictive trailer has now
decided to have a puncture.

1196
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:06,000
Well, I'm going to pay it back by not
stopping cos I haven't got time.

1197
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:10,800
I didn't even stop when the vindictive
trailer decided to be on fire.

1198
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,760
Oh, I'm gonna lose that outboard.

1199
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,920
Boat suit.

1200
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:40,520
One wheel on my wagon
and I'm still rolling along.

1201
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,880
This is good. This is very good.

1202
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,720
But then...

1203
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,360
Bloody hell.

1204
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,720
No! I'm in another dead end!

1205
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,880
There was only one thing for it:

1206
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,400
another manual three-point turn.

1207
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,440
This steel's just so
warm and comfortable!

1208
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,240
Whoa! Come on!

1209
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,760
Drifting my boat.

1210
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,920
I'm 57.

1211
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,800
No! No, no!

1212
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,240
Come on, come on, come on.

1213
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,920
Right.

1214
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,040
Meanwhile, I was
ready for the final charge.

1215
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,640
Goodbye, losers.

1216
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,520
Ignition, start!

1217
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,520
Oh, cock.

1218
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,400
I'm just going as fast as I dare.

1219
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,760
Speed... speed power.

1220
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,440
With the other two heading for failure,

1221
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,960
I got HMS Orange started

1222
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,360
and was cruising to an easy win.

1223
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,880
This is just brilliant.

1224
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,720
Full throttle!

1225
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,280
Oh, cock.

1226
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,240
The boat is beginning to behave oddly!

1227
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,360
There is a bit of water coming
in, but it's not very far.

1228
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,200
Come on!

1229
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,120
There's the flag!

1230
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,960
Oh, really?

1231
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,720
Los-er!

1232
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,440
Oh, God.

1233
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,880
- Well, hang on a minute.
- What?

1234
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,320
Where's your boat?

1235
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,400
- It's there.
- No, it's not.

1236
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,720
It's just some bits of boat!

1237
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,200
It's a boat jigsaw.

1238
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,960
So you're finishing this race
without your car,

1239
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,800
without your trailer or
the boat that was on it...

1240
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,080
- I have got the boat!
- You've got some bits of boat.

1241
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,200
- You're claiming to be the winner.
- Listen.

1242
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,640
You've come second,
you're taking it badly.

1243
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,560
I think it doesn't matter

1244
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,760
because an even more interesting race

1245
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,560
is developing out on
the water as we speak.

1246
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,800
Handling is affected by water ingress!

1247
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,800
It's getting closer to my kneecaps!

1248
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,640
Oh, Canadian flag, come on!

1249
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:00,160
Will he make it to the
finish point before he sinks?

1250
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,800
- That's got some tension in it, hasn't it?
- I know!

1251
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,800
There's no tension here, this is done.

1252
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,920
- Oh, yeah, this is very tense.
- But we'll give you more.

1253
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,680
You two! Help!

1254
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,680
Come and rescue! I'm going down!

1255
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,880
My boat's smashed to pieces, James,

1256
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,440
I can't help you with that.

1257
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:19,600
My boat's, look, it'll take me ages.
It's all the way over there!

1258
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,520
It's going down!

1259
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:24,480
I'd have to move mine out of the way...

1260
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,120
And then I'd have to walk up
there, along those rocks...

1261
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:30,360
It's gone! Oh, Jesus, ah!

1262
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,000
It's so cold!

1263
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,800
- Look, he's going...
- Argh, you bastard!

1264
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,360
Have you ever seen...

1265
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,480
Argh! My testicles are retreating!

1266
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,360
We don't need to know that!

1267
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,360
Oh, no!

1268
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,520
- Ooh!
- Oh! Oh!

1269
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,400
That hurt me just watching!

1270
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,720
I've got a runny nose thinking of it.

1271
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,000
My bits just shrivelled!

1272
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,080
That was a cold, cold day.

1273
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,640
- What could we do?
- I wouldn't want to be in that water.

1274
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:59,560
- You couldn't help.
- I really wouldn't.

1275
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,760
What that film proves is that if you
want to buy a Range Rover Velar

1276
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,840
or a Stelvio or a Macan,

1277
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,280
you're better off with a Ford Raptor.

1278
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:15,440
Yeah, not only that, the Raptor is
actually nearly half the price.

1279
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,440
Yes, but you can't
buy a Raptor in Britain.

1280
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,720
And so, on that terrible disappointment,

1281
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,600
for you lot, at least, it's time to end.

1282
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,440
Thank you so much for watching, goodbye!
