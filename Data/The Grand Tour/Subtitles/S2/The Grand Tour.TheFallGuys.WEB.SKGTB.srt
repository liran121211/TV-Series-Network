1
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
Thank you, everybody.

2
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,840
Thank you.

3
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,000
Hello!

4
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,520
- Hello, peoples!
- Hello.

5
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,360
Thank you very much.

6
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,240
Thank you.

7
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,160
Thank you so much.

8
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,720
Thank you, everybody.

9
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,480
And in this show...

10
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,600
James stands in a park,

11
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,000
I panic in a shop...

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,560
...and Richard is touched
by a man.

13
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,360
All that is coming later.

14
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,080
It is not!

15
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,720
Yes, it is. But first,
we start with this.

16
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,960
This is the new Ford GT,

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,200
and we have had thousands
of letters from people,

18
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,840
all asking the same thing -

19
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,000
"We know it's fast, very fast,

20
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,520
but is it faster
than an airliner?"

21
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,440
Well, not thousands of letters.

22
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,000
Er... no, not thousands
of letters.

23
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,320
- You mean, none.
- Yes. We've had no letters at all.

24
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,400
But I was interested in
finding out anyway,

25
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,840
so this week, The Grand Tour
is off to New York.

26
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
And here it is.

27
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,400
Deep inside the concrete
canyons of Manhattan...

28
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,320
...the fastest, most beautiful,

29
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,640
most expensive car
Ford has ever made.

30
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,800
Some are saying that it's just a
647-horsepower racing car for the road,

31
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,320
but actually,
it's a lot more than that.

32
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,760
First things first -
it is very practical.

33
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,320
It's got a boot which is
the exact same size

34
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,160
as the glove box
on a Renault Clio,

35
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,240
so you can get your luggage
in easily.

36
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,080
And unlike the previous GT,

37
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,960
it's got doors that
you can open in a car park

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,680
cos they go up rather than out.

39
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,800
And you can get inside
even if you have a head.

40
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,680
However, the seat doesn't move.

41
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,160
In order to get comfortable,
what you have to do is

42
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,520
move the steering wheel
to where you want it

43
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,920
and then you move the pedals.

44
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,440
Pull this sort of
ratchet strap here, and...

45
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,040
Right.

46
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,600
Is that... Is that fixed?

47
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,720
The problem with this
moving-pedal arrangement is

48
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,640
that when I push the brake,

49
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,960
how do I know whether
I'm applying the brakes

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,680
or just pushing the pedal
further away?

51
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,960
How do I know
whether it's locked?

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,480
I don't!

53
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,600
After some nerve-racking
city-centre miles

54
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,120
with a swallowy Adam
in my Big Apple...

55
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,640
...I arrived in Central Park,
the start point of the race

56
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
that no one's been asking about.

57
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,560
And dressed like everyone else,

58
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,920
my rival was waiting.

59
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,640
There he is, Mr Slowly.

60
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,280
- Morning.
- Hang on.

61
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Right, what's the plan?

62
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,120
Well, we're going to find out

63
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,880
whether it's faster
to fly or drive

64
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,200
from here
to the Canadian border.

65
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,680
- Fly.
- Well, you say that,

66
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,080
but if you look on a map...

67
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,160
...you, because you're not
using a car,

68
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,080
will have to go from here
in Central Park

69
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,000
on a train to JFK,
then fly to Buffalo

70
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,520
and then use a bus
to get to the finish line

71
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,960
at the Niagara Falls, where
I'll be waiting for you.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,920
You won't be waiting for me.

73
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,400
I will. This thing does
216 miles an hour!

74
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,880
Yes, I know, but where,
between there and there,

75
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,200
are you gonna do
216 miles an hour?

76
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,880
Yes, but you've got to spend two hours
at JFK being touched inappropriately

77
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,480
and giving them your toothpaste.

78
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,080
Anyway, you've got a handicap.

79
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,920
- What handicap?
- Here it is!

80
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,160
Seriously?
I thought he was in hospital.

81
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,600
No, you mean you hoped he was
in hospital, but he isn't!

82
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,200
He's come all the way out here.

83
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,400
He's keen to get back to work.

84
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,800
So I've become a carer,
is that what you're saying?

85
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,400
Yes. Morning, Hammond.

86
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,560
- Morning, chaps! How are you?
- We're very well.

87
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,840
You do know this is
a race car, don't you?

88
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,320
Yes, apart from the fact it's got
indicators and a rear-view mirror and...

89
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
Yeah, but it was built
to go racing,

90
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,760
and you do know racing cars
never work on the road.

91
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,280
After an hour in this, you'll
be scared you're gonna to die.

92
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,640
After two hours, you'll be
scared in case you don't die.

93
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,440
Shall we just get on with this?

94
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
- Ready?
- Yes!

95
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,720
What was that?

96
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,240
- Nothing, nothing.
- That looks tremendous!

97
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,120
I've got it up again now.
That was in its V-Max mode.

98
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,560
Right. Ready, steady...

99
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,080
Yes.

100
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,840
Go.

101
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,120
He hasn't got a chance, has he?

102
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,000
He has if you just
stand there. Let's go!

103
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,880
It's this way, come on.

104
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,320
There we are, leaving the park.

105
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,520
This is good.

106
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,080
Come on, Hammond.

107
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,760
Yeah, good teamwork.

108
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,280
Come on!

109
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,160
Oh, it's good to be back!

110
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,160
As this was a race between
the car and public transport,

111
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,240
we'd be using two subway
trains, the AirTrain to JFK,

112
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,720
a plane to Buffalo and then
two buses to the finish point

113
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,280
at the Niagara Falls.

114
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,440
Clarkson, meanwhile,
had a simple 420-mile thrash

115
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,520
from one side of
New York State to the other.

116
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,440
Yes! They're green on 89th.

117
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,040
And they're green on 90th.

118
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,680
We are screaming along now.

119
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,040
There are some steps here.
Can you manage?

120
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,320
Yes! Er...

121
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,640
Hammond, there's more.

122
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,280
"Start to begin. English.

123
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,480
Fast MetroCard. Cash".

124
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,000
Not everybody gives
a running commentary

125
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,160
as they get a card,
most people just do it.

126
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,880
Finally, I'd been caught
at a red light,

127
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,960
but that was OK because I had
an important call to make.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,320
Thank you for
calling JetBlue. How may I help you?

129
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,080
Good morning,
my name's Jeremy Clarkson.

130
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,920
You have a James May
and Richard Hammond

131
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,120
booked on this morning's
flight from JFK to Buffalo.

132
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,360
Sure. Do you have their confirmation number,
and can you spell their last names?

133
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,640
I don't have
a confirmation number.

134
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,840
What I can tell you is that they've
been accidentally booked by the office

135
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,080
into business class.

136
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,720
That's not company policy, so could
you drop them back down to economy?

137
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,440
Sure, let me take a look.

138
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,360
OK, I will make this update
in their reservation

139
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
and we will email you
a confirmation.

140
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,320
Is there anything else
we can help with?

141
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,600
No, not for the moment,
thanks. Thank you very much.

142
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,560
Oh, I'm on form this morning!

143
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,680
As was the world's worst carer.

144
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,960
Come on!

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,760
With the world's clumsiest
driver stuck in a barrier...

146
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,400
...I was getting used to
the monster

147
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,960
that was powering me
through Manhattan.

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,320
I used to own the old Ford GT,

149
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,920
and that was a brilliant car
in every way

150
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,200
apart from the fact that it was
the size of a football pitch,

151
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,400
I knocked myself out
every time I closed the door,

152
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,880
I couldn't see
what was coming at junctions,

153
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,440
and it had
such a small fuel tank

154
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,760
that it could only go about
six yards between fill-ups.

155
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,040
This new version, however,
is completely different.

156
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,720
It is longer than
the car I had, and wider

157
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,880
and harder to see out of,
and incredibly,

158
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,560
the fuel tank's even smaller.

159
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,640
It only holds 12 gallons.

160
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,240
And that means that
on this 420-mile race,

161
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,400
I'm gonna have
to fill up... twice.

162
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,840
Eek.

163
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,520
It also has literally the hardest
ride of any car I've ever driven.

164
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,120
I know New York's roads are
atrocious, but this is stiff.

165
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,040
This is... This is
stiffer than Ron Jeremy.

166
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,600
Meanwhile...

167
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,280
This is us.

168
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,760
Other than throwing myself
down the stairs,

169
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,640
this is all I've got.

170
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,920
Right, we missed that one.

171
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,080
In the GT, I was
already leaving Manhattan.

172
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,640
Right, we've got to go across
the Georgy Washington Bridge.

173
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,720
Heading for New Jersey.

174
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,640
Annoyingly though,
my storming progress

175
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,080
was about to be halted
by roadworks.

176
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,520
This traffic's worse than
I thought it was going to be.

177
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,800
Come on!

178
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,240
Er... James?

179
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,240
Nothing, don't worry.

180
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,600
- What?
- Nothing.

181
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,680
Yeah, but it means both of
them, not just this one.

182
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,800
Come and see the man without a
disability sitting in the special seat!

183
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,200
- Ow!
- There's nobody else disabled down here.

184
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,160
I'd be better if I could sit in that
special seat that's reserved for me.

185
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,960
It's reserved for
disabled people.

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,640
- Like me!
- You're not disabled!

187
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,400
Temporarily, yes, I am!

188
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,880
You're not disabled, you've
had a playground injury

189
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,840
as a result of your own
half-wittedness.

190
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,160
- Oh!
- That's not disabled.

191
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,560
I'm surprised you don't do more charity
work with the differently abled.

192
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,560
Yes.

193
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,040
Lot of love for the fast Ford here.

194
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,640
There always is, of course, cos they're
seen as sort of blue-collar heroes.

195
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,880
That said, this one is $400,000.

196
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,800
You can actually have two Ferraris
for the price of one of these. Two!

197
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,760
Meanwhile, Hammond was heading
for the next subway train

198
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,640
with the help
of Captain Compassionate.

199
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,640
Come on, come on,
come on! Come on!

200
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,120
Come on!

201
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,800
That's gone, then. Yeah.

202
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,760
What happened there is,
basically, we missed the train

203
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,040
because you don't know to slow down
when it says "finish" across the road.

204
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,760
- Oh, nice!
- Sorry to put it bluntly like that,

205
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,120
but that's exactly
what happened.

206
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,520
I, meanwhile,
was off the bridge,

207
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,840
and at last the GT had some
space to stretch its legs.

208
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,320
Right, now, the roads are
opening up a bit,

209
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,840
time to see what this V6 can do.

210
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,040
Right, here we go -
opening the taps!

211
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,640
Bloody Nora!

212
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,640
Aagh!

213
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,000
What a machine!

214
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,160
What an astonishing engine!

215
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,640
It's a turbo-charged V6,
not a V8,

216
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,080
which it should be in a Ford GT,

217
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,880
and it shares 60% of its components with
the engine in a Ford pick-up truck.

218
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:25,240
Yet somehow, it feels
like a mad Caterham

219
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,160
when you put your foot down.

220
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,640
I also love the way they haven't messed
around with the sound this engine makes.

221
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,920
There's no electronic trickery,

222
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,760
no artificial barks and bangs,

223
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,400
it's just a raucous,
deafening racket.

224
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,160
As Jeremy deafened
himself in New Jersey,

225
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,160
we had finished with the subways

226
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,920
and were about to board
the train to the airport.

227
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,320
- The train will be in three minutes.
- Thank you.

228
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,080
I'm gonna call May,
see how they're doing.

229
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,800
Who would you like to call?

230
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,880
Vagina.

231
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,080
I've had to change his name
in my contacts.

232
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,400
It's not normally Vagina,
it's worse than that.

233
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,240
Hello, it's me. You rang.

234
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,240
You'll have to really
speak up, my car's quite noisy.

235
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,920
I want to know,
what time do you get to JFK?

236
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,680
We will get to JFK
in 25 minutes' time.

237
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,400
This is embarrassing,
you're making a scene.

238
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,640
I'm hoping to get the
11 minutes past one flight.

239
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,520
Hello? May!

240
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,160
You know what? He's done some
Bluetoothing, hasn't he?

241
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,040
Oh, look.

242
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,680
- Oh.
- That's not worked, has it?

243
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,360
What a bloody noise, honestly!

244
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,640
- What can I do about it?
- Put some springs in them or something.

245
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,520
On the freeway,

246
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,000
I was falling even more
under the spell of the GT.

247
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,160
This car was actually developed

248
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,160
by a team of just 20 people,

249
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,680
and they did it under the
radar of Ford's management.

250
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,760
They had no idea
it was going on.

251
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,760
Their only contribution to it
was insisting it had

252
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,960
a little sort of glove-box thing
down here in front of the seat

253
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,440
so that when they were testing
it on the streets of Detroit,

254
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,880
they had somewhere
to store their Glocks.

255
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,280
And it does actually feel like it
was put together by a small team.

256
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,840
It doesn't feel like the product
of a mass-market manufacturer.

257
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,760
There's nothing subtle or damped
or gentle about anything it does.

258
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,760
I just love it!

259
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,360
On the AirTrain,

260
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,120
we too were finally
making swift progress.

261
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,960
- That's quite good, isn't it?
- That's excellent.

262
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,920
How fast would you say
this was going?

263
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,120
It's probably 60mph.

264
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,680
That's great!

265
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,920
Observe - the train is
going faster than the cars.

266
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,080
Not my car, it wasn't.

267
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,840
As we are now
in the steady cruise,

268
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,800
I've put it in "comfort",
and I can relax.

269
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,600
The office has provided me
with an audiobook,

270
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,440
which will help me
do just that. Here we go.

271
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,080
I knew innately that

272
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,720
loosening them meant
turning them anti-clockwise,

273
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,880
a tiny hairspring
that contracted...

274
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,200
Sadly, it turned out to be

275
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,040
a James May talking book
on how to mend things.

276
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,840
What I didn't
appreciate at the age of five

277
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,560
was the facility that the
freshly wound mainspring had

278
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,840
for completing the
disassembly process for me,

279
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,360
and as a quantum event
at that. It was there...

280
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,320
Having reached JFK
in no time at all...

281
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,320
...Hop-Along Hammond was now
slowing us down again...

282
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,480
...so I decided to speed him up.

283
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,680
You do realise this is not
a self-propelled one,

284
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,320
it hasn't got the big wheels,
you'll have to push me?

285
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,760
- Yeah, that's all right.
- Cool.

286
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,720
It's better than listening to that
clink-chink-clink noise for the rest of the day.

287
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,280
You've really suffered, mate. I don't
know how you've put up with it.

288
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,840
Thank you.

289
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,200
- I'm just gonna do a quick brake test.
- Yeah.

290
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,520
Yeah, they work.

291
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,680
Off came the back,

292
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,720
suspiciously easily,
I would now realise.

293
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,880
More screws lay within,
and on I went,

294
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,880
like one of Carter's
archaeologists...

295
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,560
How did he stay awake
to read that out?

296
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,560
He's reassembling
an alarm clock,

297
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,440
and he's made
an audio book of it.

298
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,880
Oh, God!

299
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,280
With Hammond
now on four wheels,

300
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,320
we were doing well.

301
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,800
This is so easy!

302
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,720
Take everything
from out of your pockets, please.

303
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,240
However...

304
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,520
Well, I left them back in the...

305
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,560
I can't get in there
without crutches.

306
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,720
You were complaining. I didn't
think you wanted them any more.

307
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,960
- You gave them away!
- You're in a wheelchair.

308
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,560
It's like a reserve parachute, you
don't go, "I'm not using that".

309
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,280
We haven't got the crutches.
Please may we go through?

310
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,160
OK.

311
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,280
It may have been OK for him,

312
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,360
but it definitely wasn't OK
for me.

313
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,760
All right,
so I'm gonna go ahead,

314
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm going to give you
a pat-down today, OK?

315
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,960
- All right, sir.
- The pat-down consists of

316
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,640
me starting from the top all the
way to the top of your feet.

317
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,760
For your sensitive areas, I have
to use the back of my hands

318
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,720
in a sliding motion, from your
waist, going down over your groin

319
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,000
and across your groin as well,

320
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,680
then sliding my way
down your leg, OK?

321
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,720
Sitrep - 300 miles to go,

322
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,360
and I've been doing
16.4 miles to the gallon,

323
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,520
and I'm on the motorway.

324
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,040
That's not bad. I mean, it's
not a prize, but it's not bad.

325
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,880
They should be at JFK now
having their penises touched

326
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,560
and deodorant confiscated.

327
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,520
I'm gonna go up and down, OK?

328
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,200
I'm going down.

329
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,360
I'll go up and down one more
time at the top of the leg.

330
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,800
At this point,

331
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,680
I decided to make life even
worse for Hammond and May

332
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,520
by making another call
to their airline.

333
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,600
Thank you for
calling JetBlue. How may I help you?

334
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,960
Really sorry to trouble you again.
It's Jeremy Clarkson here.

335
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,720
I spoke earlier about

336
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,480
downgrading Mr May and
Mr Hammond to economy class.

337
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,680
- Yeah.
- If I could tell you,

338
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,280
in confidence - they've both
just come out of rehab.

339
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,840
So on the flight,
could you make sure

340
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,400
the attendants don't
give them any alcohol?

341
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,720
Thank you for letting us know.

342
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,360
I will go onto the
reservation and make a note

343
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,320
and give it
to our in-flight crew.

344
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,680
We will make sure to accommodate
this special request.

345
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,800
Thank you
for your understanding.

346
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,680
OK, goodbye.

347
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,680
Calling Vagina.

348
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,280
Hold on.

349
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,200
- Hello?
- Where are you?

350
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,240
We're at JFK.
How far have you got?

351
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,560
I've done 153 miles.

352
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,160
- 153?
- Yeah.

353
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,480
Right, well,
this is where we catch up.

354
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,840
We're about to board
the 500mph shuttle.

355
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,400
How long's your flight?

356
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,080
One hour and 15 minutes.

357
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,800
Righty-ho. I could literally...

358
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,720
I might stop
and have lunch in a minute.

359
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll see you at the end

360
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,600
and keep a beer warm for you.

361
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,960
You definitely will need a drink if
you get to the end, I assure you.

362
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,880
Got to go now - important work.

363
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,000
Goodbye.

364
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,400
Economy and no drinks!

365
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,800
I am so gonna win this today.

366
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,560
Calls over,
I put my foot down

367
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,960
and went back
into the noise zone.

368
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,240
Honestly...

369
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,480
...you would not believe,

370
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,320
you simply wouldn't believe the
noise that that car makes.

371
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,160
It's just...
It's just so relentless.

372
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,400
I can't imagine having to put up
with that endless bellowing drone.

373
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,200
Yeah, it's a dreary drone.

374
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,320
Just going on and on
and on and on.

375
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,560
You think you had it bad, I was
travelling with a handicap!

376
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,080
James, it's not 1950. The correct
term these days is "a disabled".

377
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,440
He's not disabled,
he's just clumsy.

378
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,960
What?

379
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,600
Actually, on that whole point,

380
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,200
able-bodied people
like to think that

381
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,280
everything that could be done
to make life easier

382
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,640
and convenient for disabled
people has been done,

383
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,560
but when you find yourself
in that position,

384
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,520
you realise it really,
really hasn't.

385
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,920
The Grand Tour -
a show that cares.

386
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,840
This week it's disabled people

387
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,440
and next week we're doing
people who are BLT.

388
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,040
Erm... that's a sandwich.

389
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,320
What is it I mean?

390
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,960
You mean, LGBT.

391
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,520
Yes, that.

392
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,040
That's what I meant, not BLT.
Er... anyway...

393
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,960
It's lesbian, gay, bacon
and tomato - that's the one.

394
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,400
That's my favourite sandwich,
and we're doing that next week.

395
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,840
Later on, though,
we'll be picking the race up,

396
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,400
so don't go away.

397
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,920
Absolutely, there'll be
more of that later.

398
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,800
But now it is time for us
to lean

399
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,640
on the lamppost of chat,
in Conversation Street.

400
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,800
Right, yes, now -
Formula One season is over,

401
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,800
and as we all know, I'm sure,

402
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
Lewis Hamilton is
world champion,

403
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,040
and well done, him.

404
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,000
I think we all agree on that.

405
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm sure the Baby Jesus
was very pleased.

406
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,520
- I don't doubt it.
- They're like that.

407
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,040
They're close.

408
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,840
For me though, the highlight
of the entire season

409
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,160
was on the podium in Mexico,

410
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,160
where Kimi Raikkonen set what
I think is a new world record

411
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,000
for the longest
chug of champagne.

412
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,760
- Did he?
- Honestly.

413
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,720
Everyone else is
spraying it round.

414
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,240
Back of shot...

415
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,200
I thought, "I know
the Finns like a drink,

416
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,200
but he must have
a titanium throat!"

417
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,080
Imagine the burp he did
afterwards, a whole bottle.

418
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,600
It's staggering.

419
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,760
I think the problem is
for most people,

420
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,120
champagne on the podium
is a ritual,

421
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,560
but for Kimi Raikkonen,
it's just another drink,

422
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,640
and he hasn't had one
for at least two hours.

423
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,440
I often wonder - you know
in Abu Dhabi, on the podium,

424
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,560
they're given rose water,
not champagne?

425
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,120
If Kimi's coming 3rd,
he's thinking,

426
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,080
"I've got to go on the podium for
20 minutes and drink rose water."

427
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,400
"Oh, no, I'm 4th.

428
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,320
Straight to my motorhome
and have a beer".

429
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,400
- Tuck in!
- I mean, he is a Finn!

430
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,200
That's what they do.

431
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,960
Anyway, self-driving cars.
We're told they're coming.

432
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,120
- Yes.
- We were told this week,

433
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,920
actually,
that there's a problem.

434
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,360
In cities like New York, and I guess
other cities around the world,

435
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,280
people who drive them,
indeed the cars themselves,

436
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,800
are going to be bullied.

437
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,960
- Bullied?
- That's what they're saying.

438
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,520
Obviously, these cars will be programmed
to never run over a person, OK?

439
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,400
Which means you can just go
and stand in front of them.

440
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,160
I mean, you could.

441
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,720
You could do better than that, you
could probably herd them a bit.

442
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,720
I could herd them
and I would herd them.

443
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,120
Can you imagine
how sanctimonious

444
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,920
the man sitting in his new self-driving
car is gonna be with his paper?

445
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,720
"I'm not driving, I'm just reading
the paper while it drives me home."

446
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,440
If you just go, "Back up!"

447
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,760
It'll be going,
"I mustn't run him over!"

448
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,480
Back him into a river.
That's what I'd do, I would.

449
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,640
They'll have all those
algorithms on board

450
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,160
for moral decisions as to
what they're gonna do.

451
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,720
- So carry a fake baby.
- Good plan!

452
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,720
Walk up to it,
the car will think,

453
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,240
"Fake baby or fat, smug man
in a business suit?"

454
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,200
- He's going in the river.
- This is exactly right.

455
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,000
That would be tremendous.

456
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,040
Sadly, I don't think we're
going to see anything like

457
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,200
an autonomous car
until long after we're dead.

458
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,880
No, I couldn't
agree with you more.

459
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,360
They are years and years and
years away, decades away.

460
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,600
It's such a complicated area to
apply what is essentially robotics.

461
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,400
You're dead right
about robotics.

462
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,840
I don't yet have a robot that
could make me a cup of tea,

463
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,160
which is quite simple,
or bring me my slippers.

464
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,480
- Just domestic stuff.
- Sex robots aren't here yet.

465
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,120
That's people from Essex,
isn't it?

466
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
There's a TV show about that,
isn't there?

467
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,800
- Anyone from Essex?
- Orange Sex...

468
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,040
You're from Essex? There's
a sex robot here, look.

469
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,760
Hiya!

470
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,160
That's what he thinks of you.
I don't, personally.

471
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,640
That's amazing.
It's incredibly convincing!

472
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,760
Can you go like that...

473
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,200
Can we stop this conversation?
It's gonna go somewhere wrong.

474
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,520
The way I'd sum this up is this.

475
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,320
Somebody says, "We've made this
self-driving car, brilliant."

476
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,040
I will take him to Bolivia, put
him at the bottom of Death Road

477
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,640
and say, "Sit in it,
reading your paper

478
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,920
while it drives you up there, passing
all the buses with the 1,000-foot drop.

479
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,640
If you're prepared to do that
and you can reach the top

480
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,200
with no poo in your
underpants, I'll buy one."

481
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,800
"Enjoy reading your newspaper on the way".
It's not gonna work.

482
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,240
No, right - "Agh!"

483
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,280
That's covered
self-driving cars.

484
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,520
We needn't worry.
Shall we move it on?

485
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,040
Yes. Moving on.
Interesting news this week -

486
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,520
Jeremy has been approached
to be the ambassador...

487
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,200
- Oh, yeah!
- ...for a vineyard

488
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,600
- in the South of France.
- Yes, I have.

489
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,960
What are they thinking?

490
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,120
Imagine a better job than that.

491
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,600
Oh, yeah. "I am the Ambassador
for Chateau."

492
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,960
How's that going to go?
"Where is the Ambassador?"

493
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,760
"He's out the back,
completely clattered,

494
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,360
where he always is."

495
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,360
You're not an ambassador,
you're a customer!

496
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,480
Sorry - he's out the back
with pneumonia.

497
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,320
- Ambassadorial pneumonia.
- Still droning on about that?

498
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,120
I don't know how it's going to
work though, cos the problem is,

499
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,280
the three of us have never
had a commercial tie-in.

500
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,160
You may be surprised to hear
this - we dress ourselves.

501
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,240
No, he doesn't mean we
put our clothes on ourselves.

502
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,760
We're not sponsored by
a clothing company.

503
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,520
I know you'll be staggered
to hear that.

504
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,240
- Model's own.
- Yes, this is it.

505
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,280
I go into a shop and I
choose these and I buy them

506
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,120
with my money,
watches and everything.

507
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,000
We buy everything ourselves.

508
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,640
That's why we don't know how it
works, the commercial stuff.

509
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,600
Actually, it's funny
you should mention that,

510
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,280
because you know that
pink-and-purple-striped

511
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,360
rugby-shirt thing
I've had for years?

512
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,440
- Yeah.
- You know the one I mean.

513
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,640
- It's a top.
- I know, yeah. Top?

514
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,160
- It's a top.
- Did you say, "top"?

515
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,480
- It's a top.
- It's not a top!

516
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,840
It's not a shirt,
it's not a T-shirt.

517
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,360
Hammond, I've never said this before
and I promise I'll never say it again,

518
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,240
but I'm with James May on this.

519
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,840
- A man cannot wear a "top".
- Ordinarily, no,

520
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,160
but that is... Technically,
it's a hooped top.

521
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,440
Anyway, that's not the point.
I was at an event once,

522
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,160
and a man sidled up to me,
took me to one side.

523
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,080
He was from Gant, the big
American clothing company

524
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,880
- that made that thing originally, the shirt!
- Top.

525
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,120
He begged me, he said,
"Please stop wearing it."

526
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,720
And then...

527
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,080
It got better than that.

528
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,840
He says,
"If you stop wearing it,

529
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,320
you can have as many
free clothes as you like."

530
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,960
But I still said no
because I'm an arse.

531
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,440
Hey! What about...
Why don't we do...

532
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,520
- What?
- Reverse sponsorship.

533
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,560
It's just occurring to me.

534
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,920
You know Levi's once said I'm
ruining the Levi reputation?

535
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,760
- They did!
- Because I always wear Levi's.

536
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,960
Why don't I say to them,
"Give me 100 grand,

537
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,600
I'll wear Rounders"?

538
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,840
- Erm...
- What about watches?

539
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,880
I'm going to sit like this,

540
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,800
and I'm going to say
something deeply offensive

541
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,200
to millions of people
around the world, Omega!

542
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,360
Unless you send me 50 grand,
and I'll wear a Rolex,

543
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,320
which is the watch of choice
for all the world's arses.

544
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,320
I'm not a lawyer...

545
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,800
- Mm-hm?
- ...but isn't that extortion?

546
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,280
It is extortion.

547
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,880
It just is.

548
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,520
I've got a better idea.

549
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,200
Why don't we say to people,
they can put in bids

550
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,480
to put their logo on the bottom
of Richard Hammond's car?

551
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,840
Because the chances are...

552
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,040
Yes!

553
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,400
Thank you!

554
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,360
- Thank you.
- Imagine the commentary.

555
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,480
"Here comes Richard Hammond.
Oh, no, he's gone off! Pepsi".

556
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,360
- That's a very good idea.
- Moving on.

557
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,920
That's the end
of Conversation Street.

558
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,720
We must move it on with this.

559
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,040
Imagine what it's like
to be a car designer.

560
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,120
You love cars, you always have.

561
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,320
Your school exercise books
were full of drawings of cars.

562
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,960
You worked hard,
you got to college,

563
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,520
learned about geometry
and proportions

564
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,600
and classicism and airflow
and legislation.

565
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,480
Then one day
you get your qualification,

566
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,160
and you land your dream job
somewhere like Mercedes-Benz.

567
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,440
And you spend
your first four years

568
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,040
designing the new seat-belt release
button for the A-Class hatchback.

569
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,640
Exactly, or a tailgate handle
for a van. Ooh!

570
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,720
It's not exactly what
they dreamed of as kids,

571
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,320
is it, car designers?

572
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,360
Which is why they
occasionally get bolshie

573
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,080
and they say to the management,

574
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,640
"Look, would you please let
us do something interesting?"

575
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,360
And that is obviously what's
happened with the new Mercedes GT R.

576
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,480
You just know the designers
have said, "Can it be green

577
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,520
and can it have a mouth that
could be used for sifting krill

578
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,640
and can the bonnet
be nine miles long

579
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,520
and can it have bits of the
Battlestar Galactica on its gills?"

580
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,520
The bosses obviously thought,
"They're being idiotic."

581
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,400
But to keep them sweet,
they let them get on with it.

582
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,800
The upshot is a car
that only really appeals

583
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,760
to those that have
a mental age of eight,

584
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,320
and that's me
and every other man.

585
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,680
It even makes a childish noise.

586
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,720
Just brilliant!

587
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,640
Unfortunately however,

588
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,120
because the stylists were
allowed to do what they wanted,

589
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,400
the engineers then
stuck out their bottom lips

590
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,960
and said they wanted
a free hand too.

591
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,040
The trouble is that
unlike car stylists,

592
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,040
who are flamboyant
and usually drunk,

593
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,280
car engineers
tend to be very sensible.

594
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,560
You can tell this just by
looking at their trousers.

595
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,600
So they fitted this with
all sorts of sensible stuff.

596
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,280
It's got a flap, for example,
which lowers itself

597
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,880
from the bottom of the car
when you're going quickly

598
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,960
to reduce the air pressure
down there.

599
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,040
That literally sucks the car
into the Tarmac,

600
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,080
giving you more grip.

601
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,440
Then there's
the traction control,

602
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,080
which you can turn off
using this button here.

603
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,000
Then you can decide how off
you'd like it to be

604
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,640
using this piece of Lego here.

605
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,160
You turn it that way, and
it's really very off indeed.

606
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:15,000
Then you swivel it round, and
now it's only slightly off.

607
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,360
I never knew "off"
was a variable thing,

608
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,720
but there you go.

609
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,840
Other things - well, the body
is made from carbon fibre

610
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,400
and titanium and magnesium
to make it light.

611
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,720
And it's got two
Venturi tunnels at the back

612
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,600
and short gearing
and four-wheel steering.

613
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,880
There's so much techy stuff
on the GT R, in fact,

614
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,280
that it is really...

615
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,200
...very fast

616
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,760
and extremely well sorted out.

617
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,480
The turning, thanks to
the four-wheel steering,

618
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,040
is incredible,
and when you go through

619
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,240
Dentalcare Swindon,
run by dentists for patients,

620
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,640
it's like a small
and very eager dog.

621
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,520
Then you've got the gearbox,

622
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,520
which I think was designed by
Mystic Meg

623
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,760
because it always seems to know

624
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,080
what's going to happen next.

625
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,240
It is uncanny!

626
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,000
But the best thing is
the braking. You ready?

627
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,000
Watch this.

628
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,600
Has my face actually
come off? It has, hasn't it?

629
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,320
Small wonder, then, that
the GT R holds the lap record

630
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,440
for rear-wheel drive cars
at the Nurburgring,

631
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,400
and that is its problem.

632
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,720
Because AMG Mercs aren't really
supposed to set lap records.

633
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,160
They're not supposed to be
particularly fast.

634
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,360
You buy an AMG Merc
cos you want it to do this...

635
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
...make a lot of noise

636
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,880
while sliding through a
cloud of its own tyre smoke.

637
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,640
In an AMG Merc,

638
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,040
you don't want to go round
a corner crisply at 150,

639
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:38,760
you want to go round smiling
and sideways at about 27.

640
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,880
And there's another thing too...

641
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,960
...the engine.

642
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,840
It's a twin turbo-charged V8,

643
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,760
which produces 577
horsepower, and that's a lot.

644
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,800
But exactly the same engine
in an E-Class saloon

645
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,320
produces
more than 600 horsepower.

646
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,200
So why not use that engine
in here?

647
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,080
The only possible reason
is that soon,

648
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,360
there'll be a more powerful,

649
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
even faster version of this car,

650
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,880
so why buy this one now?

651
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,160
It's a good question.

652
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,080
I wouldn't.

653
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,080
So, who would buy a car
like that?

654
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,040
I don't know,
I've never met anyone

655
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,040
who I think would like that
car, would want to buy it.

656
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,840
Besides all that,
if you want something

657
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,560
that feels like a Porsche,
why not buy, say, a Porsche?

658
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,080
Because Porsche are really
good at making Porsches.

659
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,400
- They are.
- Yeah.

660
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,800
They're so good
at making Porsches

661
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,360
that since you filmed that,
their new GT2

662
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,920
has gone round the Nurburgring

663
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,080
faster than the GTR.

664
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,840
The worst thing is,

665
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,920
that's the first time I've
ever filmed an AMG Merc

666
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,200
and finished the day

667
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,880
on the same set of tyres
I started with.

668
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,560
And I don't like that.

669
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,920
I want an AMG Merc to eat
its own feet in every corner.

670
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,600
That's what it's for, yes.

671
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,400
Anyway, if you are
the sort of person

672
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,520
who wants to buy
a shouty, lime green car

673
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,240
that looks mad
but actually isn't,

674
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,520
then you'll probably
want to know

675
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,040
how fast it goes around
our Eboladrome.

676
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,800
Yeah. Last year,
that would have meant

677
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,640
handing it over to the American.

678
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,640
But we're not using him
any more,

679
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,680
because he didn't like
coming to England.

680
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
And because you all hated him.

681
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,320
- Well, that too.
- Little bit.

682
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,440
But the point is,
we needed a replacement,

683
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,000
we needed a new driver.

684
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,800
And we've spent
the last nine months

685
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,840
auditioning everyone
we could think of.

686
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,280
Former F1 drivers,

687
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
rally drivers, stunt drivers,
test drivers,

688
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,320
until we ended up
with the fastest.

689
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,840
And here she is.

690
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,640
Right, here we go.

691
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,760
And she's off.
Tidy start, no wheelspin,

692
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,520
full power
from the twin-turbo V8.

693
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,880
To the first corner.
Will she lift?

694
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,000
No, it didn't sound like
she did.

695
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,680
Right, second corner,
balancing the car nicely.

696
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,760
God, that thing looks planted.

697
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,640
Right, here we go,
this is the tricky bit.

698
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,840
Let's have a look how she's
getting on round here.

699
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,960
Ooh, that thing looks planted!

700
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,600
And quick.

701
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,560
She's on the raggedy edge
on the down-changes.

702
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,240
Michelins squealing in pain,
but that is...

703
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,240
Let's have a look.
Yeah, inch-perfect.

704
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,040
Now, back onto the Isn't.

705
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,960
She really has only one
throttle position here,

706
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,280
and it is in the carpet.

707
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,560
Lifting now, and into the
Old Lady's House complex.

708
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,000
Working the low-speed grip
through there.

709
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:53,280
Yeah, and back on the gas for
the bumpy run to Substation.

710
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,920
Showing no mercy down there.

711
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,160
Leaving the braking
nice and late.

712
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,320
Tidy line through
the second-to-last corner.

713
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,960
Just Field of Sheep to go.

714
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,720
Really on it through there,
and across the line.

715
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,240
That was an impressive lap,

716
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,640
but let's see how fast it was.

717
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,160
Here we go.

718
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,800
Past the... Oh, it's quicker.

719
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,040
Yes!

720
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,880
Bloody hell!

721
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,400
1:18.7. That is quick.

722
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,840
Yeah, it is, and she is
an incredible driver.

723
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,120
She's a phenomenal driver,
absolutely phenomenal.

724
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,880
We are delighted
to have her on board.

725
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,040
But now it is time to move on
to Celebrity Face-Off.

726
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Yes. And once again
it is an international event

727
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,800
as baseball takes on cricket.

728
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,960
In short,
we're trying to find out

729
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,800
who is the fastest person
in the world

730
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,400
who earns a living from throwing
and catching small balls.

731
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,320
So would you please welcome

732
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,600
Kevin Pietersen
and Brian Wilson.

733
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,480
Gentlemen!

734
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,560
Hello, sir.

735
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,720
- Kevin, how are you?
- Good.

736
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,400
Good. Have a seat.

737
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,160
Brian. Good to see you.

738
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,400
That is a look!

739
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,000
That is a look
you've got going there.

740
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,000
First of all, thank you
very much for coming.

741
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,400
Thanks for having us.

742
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,120
And let's begin
with a simple one, OK?

743
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,600
Actually, it's not that simple.

744
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,200
Kevin, could you explain
to our American viewers

745
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,840
what cricket is?

746
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,000
I think I'm very lucky,
we've got...

747
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,240
I'm bored already actually!

748
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,440
- No, go on, have another bash.
- No.

749
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,920
Just cos I don't like it
and it gives me hay fever.

750
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,440
Go on.

751
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,840
Yeah, it's very difficult.
For American...

752
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,960
I play a lot of golf with
a lot of American people

753
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,760
and they literally,
after two minutes,

754
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,680
tell me to go away,
swearing at me,

755
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,680
because how can you play a game for
five days and not get a result?

756
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,360
But there's T20s
that Brian knows about,

757
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,880
he's been to India,
he's played T20s in India,

758
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,440
and it's a pretty cool game.

759
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,000
- I reckon you could do a T20.
- No, I couldn't.

760
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,600
With cricket, you stand there
in the outfield,

761
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,120
the ball,
super-heated from re-entry,

762
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,040
is coming, "Ah, ah, ah,"

763
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,640
and then it always lands
right on the end of your...

764
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,680
- "Gah!"
- That finger?

765
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,880
- Yeah, and everyone shouts.
- That's convenient.

766
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,600
Everybody shouts,
and you drop the ball,

767
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,800
and you're batting
and some enormous man...

768
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,320
It's miserable, it goes on,
as you say, five days.

769
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,240
Actually, before we move on,

770
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,640
perhaps you could explain
to the British viewers

771
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,360
what baseball is.

772
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,600
It's not much more exciting.

773
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,400
- I've seen...
- It's a little faster.

774
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,880
I've seen clips of it in films,

775
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,880
like Good Will Hunting,
there's a scene of it.

776
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,200
It's rounders.

777
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,480
- Now, I just learned...
- It is rounders, isn't it?

778
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,400
I just learned
what rounders was today,

779
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,160
and in all fairness,
no, no, it's not like that.

780
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,400
Men play this sport as well.

781
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,080
Can you be drunk
while playing baseball?

782
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,600
- You can be, I guess, yeah.
- Cos you are...

783
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,200
Everyone is in cricket,
I presume.

784
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,680
We're all piss-heads.
Cricketers are piss-heads.

785
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,280
The great celebrated cricketers,

786
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,720
the Flintoffs, the Warnes,
piss-heads.

787
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,440
- Piss-heads?
- Piss-heads, yeah.

788
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,520
- It's OK.
- You can say that?

789
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,760
Or as we call them, ambassadors.

790
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,640
With pneumonia.
That's what it is.

791
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,960
I was astonished
to read the other day

792
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,640
about the England
cricket team and how...

793
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,640
Actually, the Australian
cricket team as well,

794
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,400
I presume it's the same
in South Africa,

795
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,400
is how much drinking went on
at the "tea break".

796
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,960
Yeah. There's a world record

797
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,480
for the amount of alcohol
consumed on an aeroplane

798
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,280
by a cricketer from Australia
for the Ashes,

799
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,440
and there was an Australian
cricketer drank 52 beers

800
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,320
on his way over from Australia.

801
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,960
That's aggressive.
That's aggressive.

802
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,440
That's a big amount.

803
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,480
- That's a big amount.
- That's a lot of drunk.

804
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,520
Now, we must move
on to cars, if we may,

805
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,520
- having covered the sport.
- Sure.

806
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,160
Maybe begin with you, Brian, OK?

807
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,960
You had,
I think it's fair to say,

808
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,680
an inauspicious start
to your driving career.

809
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,560
It wasn't the best start, no.

810
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,840
So, 16, got my licence.

811
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,440
First day, I got a speeding
ticket, that was expected.

812
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,600
Second day, though,
it's about 1am,

813
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,840
apparently we have a curfew
I didn't know about,

814
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,920
you have to be in bed
by a certain time.

815
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,040
As a 16-year-old,
I'm thinking, "No, I don't."

816
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,680
So I rolled through
the stop sign,

817
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,760
and I see the blue lights,
and I'm thinking,

818
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,000
"I'm in a '94 Thunderbird,
this is a V8 engine."

819
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,800
So I speed.

820
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,440
Now I'm getting
in a police chase.

821
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,480
- Now the adrenaline's going.
- Second day?

822
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,840
The second day.

823
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,560
I'm driving around
my neighbourhood,

824
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,480
and I accidentally hit
an electrical box

825
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,880
and the power goes out
and I feel really bad.

826
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,960
But I left this guy in the dust.

827
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Like, I got all the way
to my driveway.

828
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,720
But because
I turned the keys off...

829
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,360
The car was automatic lights.

830
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,720
So the cop
just followed the lights

831
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,360
and arrested me in my
driveway, my front yard.

832
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,560
And so what do you get
for that, for...

833
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,760
What do you get? You get to go
to jail, you get a free ride.

834
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,120
And I'm amazed
they pull you over,

835
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,160
cos you look like
an accountant, I mean...

836
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,120
This is a slow Tuesday.
See me on the weekends!

837
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,440
So, Kevin, your first car
was a Nissan...

838
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,440
- Pulsar.
- Which is a bit boring.

839
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,880
It's not as good as his
V8 Thunderbird, is it?

840
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,880
It is boring, apart from
a couple of gadgets.

841
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,120
I got a couple of gadgets

842
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,160
that were put in
by my late grandfather.

843
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,600
And in South Africa, the
crime rate's pretty severe,

844
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,760
so there was a switch he had
put underneath the ignition

845
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,840
you had to flip before
you could turn the car.

846
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,080
If you didn't flip it
within 20 seconds, the car...

847
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,760
Would explode, killing
everybody within 40 yards.

848
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,320
- That's safe!
- The South African way.

849
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,920
There was another one,

850
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,800
every time you put it into
reverse, "Doo, doo, doo."

851
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,960
I'm a cool 18-year-old
driving around Durban,

852
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,760
I put it in reverse, everyone goes,
"Where's the (BLEEP) truck?"

853
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,160
It was a little red
Nissan Pulsar,

854
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,920
"Doo, doo, doo, doo," out of it.

855
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,400
So really, you're basically
a slightly more wild driver.

856
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,960
Did you not buy a police car
at one stage?

857
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,960
I did have a police car.

858
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,760
And I did get
pulled over in that. So...

859
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,120
Again, why would you
get pulled over?

860
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,800
It wasn't my fault, though.

861
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,440
They said I was trying to
impersonate a police officer,

862
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,800
which I wasn't, it was just
a cool car to drive in.

863
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,560
I may have pulled a friend
over as a joke.

864
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,880
- But who wouldn't?
- Did you have sirens and all?

865
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,880
Yeah, you have sirens.

866
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,080
Have you ever gone anywhere
in a car

867
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,880
and not been pulled over
by the police?

868
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,080
Just thinking, going back
to the sporting thing,

869
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,400
when you played cricket
briefly in India,

870
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,600
you managed to get
into trouble with that one.

871
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,480
- Yeah, and felt really bad.
- Really?

872
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,800
So, well, where I was,
it was just a large field

873
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,800
and there might have been
100 games going on,

874
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,360
all the kids
from around local playing,

875
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,040
and they said,
"Hey, you wanna try?"

876
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,160
So no one tells me
any of these rules,

877
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,520
so there's these three little...

878
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,480
- What do you call, wickets?
- Wickets.

879
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,840
- Stumps.
- "OK, what do I do?"

880
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,960
They give me this
paddle-looking thing,

881
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,200
and like, "Just stand there,

882
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,000
and then this guy's
gonna throw to you."

883
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,680
He throws it, it hits
the ground, I'm like, "What?

884
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,640
That's a bad pitch."
And it hits the wickets,

885
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,320
and all the kids start
laughing at me.

886
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,040
"What are you guys laughing
at? Give me another shot!"

887
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,000
So I stand up, pff,
just absolutely destroy it.

888
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,160
It leaves the park, it hits
an apartment building,

889
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,640
and I'm just like,
"I'm the greatest!"

890
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,840
The guy that brought me there
told me

891
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,480
that's the only ball
that they have.

892
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,560
And immediately
I just went, "Oh.

893
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,480
I feel terrible."

894
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,600
"We've had that ball in our
town for three generations."

895
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,160
- They would have.
- Treasure it.

896
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,760
Now, going back to cars,
you, at one stage,

897
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,800
as I understand it,
had a Vauxhall Vectra.

898
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,960
I did.

899
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And you said to our researcher

900
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,920
when they called you
the other day,

901
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,760
"I have nothing particularly
interesting to say about that."

902
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,160
I've been known to be
a straight-shooter.

903
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,920
Put it there.
I once had to do a TV show

904
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,480
where I was asked
to review one of those,

905
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,320
and couldn't think of a thing.

906
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,960
It was four wheels
and a (BLEEP) seat.

907
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,400
Why did you have one?

908
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,880
The team were sponsored
by Vauxhall.

909
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,640
You were sponsored by Vauxhall?

910
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,280
Oh, I'd have gone and done
another sport.

911
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,360
Now, we must get
on to why you are here.

912
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,720
Obviously, you're only the second group
of people we've had around the track.

913
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,520
- How was it out there?
- It was...

914
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,960
I found it comfortable
on the tar,

915
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,920
but as soon as we veered
off there, it was difficult.

916
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,880
- It was intimidating.
- Is it?

917
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,760
I (BLEEP) loved it!

918
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,680
There were grass clippings
all over the car,

919
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,000
I just took it off-road
a little bit, it was fun.

920
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,240
Yeah, I've been hearing.

921
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,920
We can get it mended
for next week.

922
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,760
Kevin, we're gonna see
your lap first.

923
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,200
OK, let's bring it up
and see how you got on.

924
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,040
Is that
a slow-motion start?

925
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,800
Oh, no, you're building up
speed as you cross the line.

926
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,440
Come on, Kevin!

927
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,280
Ooh, that's
a determined-looking face.

928
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,880
Clipping the corner,

929
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,200
but keeping two wheels
on the track, nice to see.

930
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,600
Yes, you've done what I do.
You brake there

931
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,160
and then you've got a slingshot

932
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,280
into what we're calling
the Difficult Bit.

933
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,640
That's when it goes
really skatey as you...

934
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,160
You've really gotta pay...

935
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,800
Ooh, I say, that's rather good.

936
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,640
For a man who grew up
with a Pulsar.

937
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,480
Kevin, you absolute numpty!

938
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,160
Right, oh, look at
that, it's got the tail out.

939
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,480
Yeah, got the tail
out, got him going good.

940
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,080
Traction control saved it,

941
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,920
now you can floor it
through to Difficult Bit 2.

942
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,480
Oh, she's going all right.
Nicely done.

943
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,120
- That was tough.
- Yeah.

944
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,360
It is a tough bit.
This is really slippery

945
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,880
when you come back
on the Tarmac,

946
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,320
you think that's OK,
and it isn't.

947
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,240
Tyres being absolutely tortured,

948
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,560
that's looking nice.

949
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,040
Right, onto the straight.

950
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,320
Come on, baby! Come on, baby!

951
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,480
It's more exciting
than cricket, way more!

952
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,280
As is being asleep.

953
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,160
Were you flat-out through there?

954
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,200
I was flat-out through
there, then I messed this up.

955
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,800
Ooh! I'm not...

956
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,440
Yeah, I messed it up,
I missed the curve.

957
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,880
Ballsy flat-out through there,

958
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,960
but you crossed the line,
you did it.

959
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,360
I got it. Time?

960
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,400
So...

961
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,600
Time?

962
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,160
- Patience.
- Time?

963
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,680
You're a cricketer,
we know you have patience.

964
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,960
OK.

965
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,880
Because what else
is there to have?

966
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,880
- It wasn't bad.
- No, it looked OK.

967
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,480
- Brian.
- Yes.

968
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,680
- Want to see his lap?
- Yeah.

969
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,120
Come on, let's see Brian's.

970
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,360
Oh.

971
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,240
Right, no creeping
across the line.

972
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,160
And here we go! Yee!

973
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,840
That is a colourful
comb... That's a...

974
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,960
Cheat. He's cheating! Cheat!

975
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,680
He's a cheat!

976
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,200
It's not Formula One,

977
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,160
we won't penalise him for
this, we have no stewards.

978
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,480
Oh!

979
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,960
Oh, my God!
Coming in hot!

980
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,400
Holding it well, though,

981
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,080
and, I must say,
that is exuberant.

982
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,600
He's on fire!

983
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,560
Into the gravel cell,
the banked gravel corner,

984
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,600
nicely done through there.

985
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,280
Look at those stones
coming off the back of that.

986
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,840
Difficult Bit 2.

987
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,960
Floor it.

988
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
You don't think this is
gonna be slippery but it is.

989
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,840
Every time, that happens.

990
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,640
Nicely held, though, Brian.

991
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,360
You really do get around.

992
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,720
And there he is, onto the
main straight and relaxing.

993
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,800
Yoo!

994
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,600
Well, not
completely relaxing.

995
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,440
Were you flat through here,
as well?

996
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,400
Ooh.

997
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,720
I took it...
Flat-out, that's good.

998
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,800
Braking hard.

999
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,160
Not bad at all.

1000
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,320
And there we are, across the
line, that's both of them.

1001
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,760
Right. Now, I've got
your times here.

1002
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,680
I'll tell you one thing,
they're very, very close.

1003
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,160
So you were kind of smooth
and crickety.

1004
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,120
- Yeah.
- You were kind of exuberant.

1005
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,280
- Yeah.
- They are ridiculously close.

1006
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,200
- OK, here we go.
- The suspense.

1007
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,520
- I mean, come on.
- Yeah.

1008
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,800
- Killing me.
- OK, Kevin.

1009
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,040
- 1:17.2.
- 1:17.2?

1010
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,800
So at the moment,
you're the fastest man

1011
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,840
who's ever been round our track.

1012
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,400
- Until...
- This precise moment.

1013
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,080
Until about 30 seconds.

1014
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,000
Brian Wilson...

1015
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,880
- Ooh.
- 1:17...

1016
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,800
- Ooh.
- Point one.

1017
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,480
- Give it to me.
- ..five.

1018
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,840
- Damn it!
- Ah!

1019
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,160
Seriously, 0.3 of a second.

1020
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,160
Well done, sir.

1021
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,560
- That's close.
- That is nice.

1022
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,840
That is a nice result,
I'm very pleased with that.

1023
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,960
And there we are,
you are still the fastest man

1024
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,320
who's been round our track.

1025
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,240
You have come a long way
for nothing.

1026
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,120
Thank you.

1027
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,640
- Literally nothing...
- Much appreciated.

1028
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,800
So, honestly, I mean
it's been an absolute joy

1029
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,120
- having you both here...
- Came here for the sheep.

1030
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,040
Yeah, no, take one home.

1031
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,200
So there we are,
ladies and gentlemen,

1032
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,520
Brian Wilson, and the fastest
person who makes a living

1033
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,880
by throwing and hitting
and catching small balls,

1034
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,320
Kevin Pietersen!

1035
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,840
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

1036
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,920
Right.

1037
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,680
Now, this week
we are having a race

1038
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,840
from Central Park in New York
to Niagara Falls,

1039
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,480
and it's Jeremy
in the new Ford GT

1040
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,160
against James and me

1041
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,520
in a whole selection
of public transport.

1042
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,200
Yes, and when
we left the action,

1043
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,640
Jeremy was miles ahead
in the car,

1044
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,240
slowly going deaf
from the drone of the engine.

1045
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,960
But now we were
about to haul him in

1046
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,160
as we boarded
the flight to Buffalo.

1047
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,840
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1048
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,360
Ow! Sorry.

1049
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,080
Get out of the way. Get out
of the way, I'm in a race.

1050
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,320
Hello. Hello.

1051
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,160
Don't get in the way of someone

1052
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,680
who's just given up
a 43-year smoking habit.

1053
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,760
Meanwhile...

1054
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,240
Has he got to go in that?

1055
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,160
Yes.

1056
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,840
OK, see you on board.

1057
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,560
- Welcome aboard.
- Hello. Thank you.

1058
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,560
Oh, God.

1059
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,560
Hello. Hello.

1060
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,360
Yeah.

1061
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,760
OK.

1062
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,000
Having covered
160 miles,

1063
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:14,880
the GT's tiny tank
was now nearly empty.

1064
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:20,280
This is a splash-and-dash.
Right, petroleum.

1065
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,560
Oh, please let it not be

1066
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,440
one of those stupid
American ones

1067
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,520
where I've gotta pay first,
I don't know how much I want.

1068
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,840
Sadly, it was.

1069
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,920
No. Not a debit card.

1070
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,040
I haven't got one... Ah.

1071
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,920
What?

1072
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,320
All exits are marked
with a sign overhead...

1073
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,440
It's very unusual having business
class at the back, isn't it?

1074
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,720
Imagine what it's like
at the front.

1075
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,520
Must be sort of like there.

1076
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,920
It's quite good if you sit at
the back in business class,

1077
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,480
survey the whole aeroplane.

1078
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,760
This is an Embraer 190.

1079
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,640
I can tell you a bit about
these actually.

1080
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,040
Prepare for departure.

1081
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,720
Oh, dear, you can't,
he's talking.

1082
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,840
Hello. Can I...
The pump says...

1083
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,440
It's just coming up
"not approved".

1084
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,600
Does it have a chip?
It's probably the chip.

1085
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,120
How do I pay? Cos...

1086
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,040
I'll turn the pump on,
you pump what you need

1087
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,200
and I'll let you run
the card when you're done.

1088
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,520
Thank you so much.

1089
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,360
If you talk like Hugh Grant,
you can get anywhere.

1090
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,400
Any minute now, Richard
Hammond and James May

1091
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,480
will be thinking,
"Mmm, a beer, I think."

1092
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,960
Anyway, here we go,
let's catch him up.

1093
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,200
Definitely.

1094
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:47,200
I think we should celebrate
our progress right now,

1095
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,800
as we're moving so well.

1096
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,240
- Hello.
- Hello.

1097
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,400
- Hi.
- Can we have beer?

1098
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,720
- Two beers, please.
- Let me see.

1099
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,520
So, as it turns out,

1100
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,400
unfortunately I won't be able
to serve you any beer today.

1101
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,360
Can I offer you a water,
Coke, Sprite?

1102
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,440
- You've got no beer?
- No, I'm sorry.

1103
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,320
Wine. Wine? Two glasses
of wine? White wine.

1104
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,960
I'm not quite too sure why,

1105
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,760
but unfortunately
I won't be able to.

1106
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,440
Can I get you
some other beverages?

1107
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,360
However, while they
were squashed and thirsty,

1108
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,200
there was no getting round
the fact

1109
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:23,120
that they were doing 500mph,
and I wasn't.

1110
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,000
Come on, fellow Ford driver,
get out of the way, please.

1111
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,560
You've got a Ford!

1112
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,320
We are gonna be
reeling him in now.

1113
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,360
We're not gonna get stuck
behind anything.

1114
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,560
- No.
- In traffic.

1115
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,920
No. Nobody is gonna have
a puncture.

1116
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,560
Or shed the load
from a pick-up truck.

1117
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,480
No.

1118
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,840
My biggest problem,
though,

1119
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:53,720
was the woeful lane discipline.

1120
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,480
And you're gonna stay in
that lane, are you, really?

1121
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,720
Undertaking.

1122
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,320
This is allowed in the
United States and America.

1123
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:10,800
You can see why. People
don't use their mirrors.

1124
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,640
It was a problem.

1125
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:16,480
And then there was a bigger one.

1126
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,680
What the hell's this?
I'm in a traffic jam.

1127
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,880
A bloody traffic jam. No.

1128
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,040
We're about to begin
our descent

1129
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,320
into the Buffalo airport.

1130
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,000
We'll be on the ground shortly.

1131
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,360
Look.

1132
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,800
Is there a fat idiot
in a very fast Ford?

1133
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,080
- Nope.
- Good.

1134
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,600
Why is there a traffic jam?
And it's a bad one.

1135
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,920
Look, we're all stopped.

1136
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:49,240
Come on. Come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

1137
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,600
Go, go, go, go, go.
Chair, please.

1138
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,040
Oh, shit.

1139
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,440
There we go. I'm in.

1140
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:12,280
Blimey! Yeah, that is...
I am safe.

1141
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,080
Incident.
There's been an accident.

1142
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,800
There's the problem. Jesus.

1143
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,160
We have some time to make up.

1144
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,600
Seeing an accident like that
normally slows you down,

1145
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,840
but I couldn't do that.

1146
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:32,120
I was upholding
the honour of the car.

1147
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,280
They should be landing
in about ten minutes.

1148
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,760
Oh, no.

1149
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,360
May? You've landed?

1150
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,440
- Yes! Yes.
- James, too loud. Too loud.

1151
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,640
Where are you?

1152
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,960
I'm 130 miles from Buffalo.

1153
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,600
He's 130 miles away.

1154
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,240
Well, you better
get a move on then

1155
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,960
in your 200 and whatever
it is mile-an-hour car.

1156
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,520
I... Oh.

1157
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,040
- That's...
- Keep going.

1158
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,080
Oh, for God's.... Shut up.

1159
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,400
Bye.

1160
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,080
Right, where do we get the bus?

1161
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:11,360
We now only had a
couple of dozen miles to go.

1162
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,080
We'd catch a bus into Buffalo

1163
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,880
and then another
to the finish line

1164
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,360
at the Niagara Falls.

1165
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,800
Trying to think
where this went wrong.

1166
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,120
George Washington Bridge,
that didn't help.

1167
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,840
The accident and the traffic jam
that resulted, that didn't help.

1168
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,440
But I think the main problem

1169
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,960
is that Jet Blue managed to do

1170
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,800
an hour and 15 minute flight
in an hour.

1171
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,680
Oh, I say.

1172
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,720
Oh, I see,
it folds out like that?

1173
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,040
- That's very clever.
- Here we go.

1174
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,800
- Thank you.
- Aligned.

1175
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,040
- There's a wheelchair section right over there.
- Thank you very much.

1176
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,280
Come on. Yay!

1177
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:57,360
The Trump enthusiast
has pulled over!

1178
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,160
Right, let's find out
where he is.

1179
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:08,160
It's Mr Bell End.
Hammond, where are you?

1180
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,720
Leaving the airport on a bus.

1181
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,200
Right. Well,
I'm 90 miles behind you.

1182
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:18,440
You're gonna have
to make that up in no time.

1183
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,200
How far are you
from Niagara Falls now?

1184
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,520
23 miles.

1185
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,240
I'd say
you could be doomed.

1186
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,320
Good luck,
we're getting closer. Bye.

1187
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,280
He's never gonna do it.

1188
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:38,480
Oh! I don't want this car
to lose, I properly love it.

1189
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,920
It's just so exciting.

1190
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,560
All the things that make it
bad and annoying

1191
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,800
make it brilliant and exciting.

1192
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,920
The noise, and the ride,
and the roughness.

1193
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:54,040
It's just raucous, raw,
bareback, unplugged energy.

1194
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:01,200
I want it to win,
I want it to beat the plane.

1195
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:04,560
But to do that, it
would have to do 113 miles

1196
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:08,360
in the time it takes a bus
to do 23.

1197
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,080
Stop requested.

1198
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,200
Luckily, however,

1199
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,960
buses have other people on them.

1200
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,200
I don't like this bit.
What do you do?

1201
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,840
You just have to sit here.

1202
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,440
Yeah. Bus travel
is tricky to like, isn't it?

1203
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,320
And we've gotta stop
and change buses,

1204
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,400
and if we lose ten, 15 minutes
waiting for the next bus...

1205
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,000
I know, it's not in the bag.

1206
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,040
76 miles.

1207
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,880
Stop requested.

1208
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,840
Who pulled the...

1209
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:42,280
Well, it is a bus with...
Can't be rude to customers.

1210
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,840
Nobody else pull the string
until we've got off, please.

1211
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:45,920
Let's just go all the way.

1212
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,240
Hello. Where are you?

1213
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,840
I think about 55 miles away
from the finish line.

1214
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,680
- 55?
- Yeah.

1215
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,160
Right, this is gonna be close.

1216
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,680
Have you not got to Buffalo yet?

1217
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,520
No, no, we're in Buffalo,

1218
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,200
but we haven't got
to the bus change point.

1219
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:13,880
Oh, really? Oh!
Does your bus keep stopping?

1220
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,120
Well, of course it does,
it's a bloody bus!

1221
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,120
I haven't been on one
since I was eight.

1222
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,960
That kept stopping.

1223
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,280
I thought, "I won't go on
another one, they're stupid."

1224
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,040
- They're still the same.
- Bye-bye.

1225
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,520
Amazingly,
I was still in the running,

1226
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:33,600
but my furious pace meant
I had to make a decision.

1227
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:37,760
Do I drive like Al Gore would
want me to drive, at 55mph,

1228
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,640
and possibly make
the finish line

1229
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,040
without having to fill up again,

1230
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,640
or do I floor it,
go really quickly,

1231
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,120
and have a quick
splash-and-dash?

1232
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,200
Do I risk running out...
Oh, no, I can't.

1233
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,720
Meanwhile,
not that far ahead,

1234
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:58,080
we had reached the bus station.

1235
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,200
And James, incredibly,
was doing running.

1236
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,000
Where the hell is it?

1237
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,960
Niagara Falls, Niagara Falls.
48, look.

1238
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,880
It's that one there. In we go.

1239
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,920
Right, we need
a swift departure.

1240
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,720
Hello! Oh! He's missed the ramp.

1241
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,520
This is so irritating.

1242
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:17,720
I've got 35 miles to go,
that's all,

1243
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,520
but I'm not gonna make it
on the fuel,

1244
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,800
I just know I'm not.

1245
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,680
I'm gonna have to fill up. Argh!

1246
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,320
- So, 15 miles from here?
- Yeah.

1247
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:34,040
It's 35 miles.
Four gallons will do it.

1248
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,320
That will do.

1249
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,200
Now approaching
Mohawk Street.

1250
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,560
No need to stop.

1251
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,360
No, no need to stop,
we're all fine.

1252
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,160
Ah, roadworks!

1253
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,880
- Ten miles, Richard Hammond.
- Ten miles to go?

1254
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:00,080
Yes, joy of joys,
two actual lanes open.

1255
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,200
Get a bloody move on!

1256
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:15,440
12 million people a year
visit Niagara Falls.

1257
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,160
Do they?

1258
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,520
I want them all to get in
Jeremy's way, but not ours.

1259
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,960
Yes, Niagara Falls.

1260
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:32,400
No, no, no. No, a toll. Argh!

1261
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,840
Luckily, though,
I had an electronic pass,

1262
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,160
which made paying much faster.

1263
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,600
See, Hammond,
it's right there. See it?

1264
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,160
- Yeah.
- See the spray?

1265
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,720
Yeah.

1266
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,320
It's not working. No!

1267
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,040
Right.

1268
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,880
Stop requested.

1269
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,440
- Is this it?
- This is our stop.

1270
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,040
- Yeah.
- Right.

1271
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,440
Four miles.

1272
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,680
Are you gonna have a heart attack on television?

1273
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,600
Yeah.

1274
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,360
Don't wanna lose this.

1275
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,600
What's it say there? "Falls".

1276
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:48,560
Right, this is it.

1277
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,920
Where the hell are they?

1278
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,280
There's the observation tower.

1279
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,560
There is the observation tower,
that's where I'm headed.

1280
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,880
Dicky wheel.

1281
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:15,120
Ah! Oh! I have been turned into Richard
Hammond by six hours in that car.

1282
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,680
This is it.
There's the bridge thing.

1283
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,080
Oh, God. Jesus.

1284
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,360
- In we go.
- Howdy.

1285
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,960
Ooh.

1286
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,560
Oh, God,
so it all comes down to,

1287
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,520
is he the other side
of this barrier?

1288
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,240
Can you get that door, Hammond?

1289
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,640
Yeah, I got it, got it, got it.

1290
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:44,920
Oh. Hang on. Oh. Look.

1291
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,560
Let me sit down, sorry.
Put the brake on.

1292
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,600
How long you been here?

1293
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:53,480
Long enough
to do some nice pictures

1294
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,720
- and some Instagram work.
- Oh, good.

1295
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,280
Why are you so tired?

1296
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,480
I've been pushing him uphill!

1297
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,760
- He doesn't like it.
- He's actually sweating.

1298
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,040
- He's been running!
- I've run on the internet.

1299
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,960
I thought he might have
a heart attack.

1300
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,320
James May is going to die
live on TV.

1301
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,840
I'm gonna do it here,
just talk amongst yourselves.

1302
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,240
The gloating gets worse.

1303
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:30,880
So there we are, the answer to the
question that no one was asking is:

1304
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:35,200
Yes, the Ford GT
is faster than an airliner.

1305
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,160
No, it's faster than a bus.

1306
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,040
And it crippled you
and made you deaf.

1307
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,720
He didn't exactly arrive
in tip-top shape, did he?

1308
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,360
No, but hang on,

1309
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,600
that's because I had to
push him around all day,

1310
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,000
and it was like having

1311
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,760
a massive wheeled suitcase
with an opinion

1312
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,240
that pointed at things
like Rommel all the time.

1313
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:54,040
He was the only one who had
a comfortable day, actually.

1314
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,120
- You were.
- You were.

1315
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,720
Cos the honest truth is,

1316
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:00,080
that Ford GT went through
a city and on a motorway,

1317
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,240
and neither
of those environments

1318
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,880
is where it's really at home.

1319
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,600
Yes, like I said in New York,
it's a racing car.

1320
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,040
Yes, which is why I'm going to
get one brought over to the UK

1321
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,760
and later I'm gonna thrash
it round the Eboladrome.

1322
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,880
- You're gonna do that?
- As opposed to?

1323
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,040
Well, uh... me?

1324
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,880
People wanna know
what it's like on a track,

1325
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,320
not what it's like on its roof.

1326
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,560
And on that terrible
disappointment, for you,

1327
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,800
it's time to end.

1328
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:30,320
Thank you so much
for watching, goodnight.
