1
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,440
Thank you!

2
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,240
Hello! Hello!

3
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,360
- Thank you.
- Hello!

4
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,040
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

5
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,800
Thanks, everybody, and welcome!

6
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,200
And in today's show...

7
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,120
Richard chooses
his favourite waterfall.

8
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,000
I like that big one.

9
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,960
...James waters
a stranger's barbecue...

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,800
...and I put
some dust on a girl.

11
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,680
All that is to come,
but we start with McLaren.

12
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,880
They have replaced the 650
with a new car

13
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,160
which is fast around the corners
and faster in a straight line.

14
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,680
Plainly, then, the only one of us
three qualified to drive such a thing

15
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,480
is Richard "Whoops,
I've Done It Again" Hammond.

16
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,480
While the outgoing car
may have been great to drive,

17
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,200
it was never what you'd call beautiful,
or even very exciting to look at,

18
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,920
but its replacement, well
that's a different matter.

19
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,040
It's called the 720S,
and from any angle

20
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,640
and in every detail,
it's simply sensational.

21
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,160
Right down to the engine bay that
glows red when you unlock the doors.

22
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,600
Yup, on the head-turn-o-meter

23
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,280
this thing definitely matches
the Ferrari 488

24
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,240
and the Lamborghini Huracán.

25
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,800
And then when we move onto the
business of speed and power,

26
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,760
it actually beats them.

27
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,720
Nought to 60
takes just 2.8 seconds.

28
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,080
Top speed is 212 miles an hour.

29
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,080
Both those numbers walloping
the efforts of the Italians.

30
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,840
Everything is bigger
in this car.

31
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,600
Even the price, £208,000.

32
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,800
Oh, wait, that's not a good point, is it?
No, that's a... Never mind. Whatever.

33
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,320
The horsepower is...
Well, it's ridiculous is what it is.

34
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,000
This four-litre V8 with its
twin-turbos produces 710 of them.

35
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,640
To put that into context, the actual
mechanical engine in a McLaren P1

36
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,080
without all the hybrid
battery boost

37
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,360
produces
just 17 horsepower more.

38
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,680
The net result of that is...

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,760
...staggering!

40
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,240
Ooh, that is fast.

41
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,680
However, although they've gone nuts
with the styling and the engine,

42
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,960
the 720
is still very much a McLaren.

43
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,400
By that, I mean it's been made

44
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,600
by the ultimate tech nerds
from the Kingdom of Geeks.

45
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,080
Let me put it this way.

46
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
This is, like I say,
the replacement

47
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,160
for the McLaren 650S.

48
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,880
If you ask a McLaren technician, so
how much of this car is new then,

49
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,160
they will tell you 91%.

50
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
Not, "nearly all of it, mate,"

51
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
or "about 90%".

52
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,920
91%.

53
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,760
James May applied for a job
at McLaren

54
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,880
but they turned him down
for being too slapdash.

55
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,280
And this incredible geekery
has paid dividends.

56
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,600
For example, one of the reasons
the 720 looks so pretty

57
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,200
is because it's the only
mid-engine super car

58
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,480
without massive gaping
intakes behind the doors.

59
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,760
Instead, McLaren created
subtle channels

60
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,400
along the bodywork to feed
air into the engine bay.

61
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,960
More nerd stuff. The old car, the 650, had
a carbon fibre tub that came up to here.

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,440
On the 720, all of this, all of that down
the centre, everything, is carbon fibre.

63
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,640
That means these carbon windscreen
pillars can be very thin,

64
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,760
which makes it easier
to see out, and it's light.

65
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,120
Overall, they've lost
about 18 kilograms up here.

66
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,440
That means the centre of gravity
is lower, which is good.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,120
Then there's the
computer-controlled suspension,

68
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,040
which is even more advanced
than the system on the P1.

69
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,360
It makes the ride on this
700-horsepower hardcore supercar

70
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,480
as comfortable
as a nice sit down.

71
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,760
The question is, what does all that
comfortableness mean for the handling?

72
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,080
Here we go. Track mode...
active.

73
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,920
Haw! I like that.
I do like that.

74
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,480
Right! Um, well, carry on!

75
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,760
Oh, my God!

76
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,080
This is breath-taking!

77
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,320
The new chassis control
system on this,

78
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,000
based on the work of proper
pointy-heads in Cambridge,

79
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,480
it's all about maintaining the
biggest possible contact patch

80
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,440
between the tyres
and the tarmac.

81
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,320
God! It's the grip!
It's staggering!

82
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,560
It feels like
a four-wheel drive.

83
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,560
But if you do want things
to get a little more lairy,

84
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,120
simply dive into the
computers and activate

85
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,320
Variable Drift Control. It lets you select
the angle of dangle through your drift

86
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,480
by varying the amount
of traction control.

87
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,720
I think we'll go for all of
it, lots of drift available.

88
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,640
Yeah, maybe less than that,
I think.

89
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,760
I think I'm gonna have 38%.

90
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,000
38.5.
This is a McLaren. Accuracy.

91
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,960
And that seemed to do the trick.

92
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,960
Yes!

93
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,200
Yes! Working! That's it!

94
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,360
I know my setting on a McLaren's
Variable Drift Control.

95
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,920
Unleash the beast!

96
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,680
And when you've finished
your slide fest...

97
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,960
...you can switch back
to comfort mode,

98
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,640
and settle down
for a relaxing cruise.

99
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,080
That's the thing that
stands out about this car,

100
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,560
it's everything in one. You
want speed, you get speed.

101
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,280
You want comfort,
you get comfort.

102
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,760
You wanna lose tyre rubber,
help yourself.

103
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,640
You want boot space,
there's plenty.

104
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,120
But the thing I keep coming
back to is those looks.

105
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,680
Because at last, McLaren's
technical perfection

106
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,320
has been clothed in a way
that does justice

107
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,200
to the fizzing brilliance
underneath.

108
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,320
God, I'm falling in love
a bit here.

109
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,000
Actually, no, I'll go further, I'm in love.
This is utterly brilliant.

110
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,840
No, you're wrong.
Well, no, I drove that car,

111
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,640
not that one, but I drove a 720 a couple
of weeks ago and I didn't love it.

112
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,200
Are you just being obtuse
because I did?

113
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,360
No, no, honestly. I didn't
like the brake pedal.

114
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,520
- Oh, was it the wrong shape?
- The wrong colour?

115
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,160
- No.
- Was it in the glove box? Was it the handbrake?

116
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,280
- No.
- Was it round and in front of you?

117
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,280
No! Listen! The problem was -
imagine a volume knob on a stereo

118
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,040
where the volume doesn't
start till you get to six.

119
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,040
So you push
and then it all happens.

120
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,040
You wouldn't have
noticed it on the track,

121
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,360
but on the road it was almost
impossible to drive smoothly.

122
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,240
It drove me mad. Nearly
as mad as the seat controls.

123
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,120
What was wrong with those, then?

124
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,960
They were really complicated.

125
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,640
I should explain, by the way,
that this is a man

126
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,880
who a couple of days ago summoned a
woman from the other side of London

127
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,720
to help him send a tweet.

128
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
- Yeah, he did!
- No.

129
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,120
- It was a complicated tweet.
- No, it wasn't complicated.

130
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,960
- Did you try the seat control?
- Can I say, actually, yes.

131
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,600
And I agree with you,
there's no sense to it.

132
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,880
There's no sense to all this.
You can't recline.

133
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,880
You can't make them
do what you want.

134
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,760
Anyway, let's forget the seat controls
and let's forget the brake pedal

135
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,640
and let's find out how fast the
720 goes round the Eboladrome.

136
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,040
- With someone who can adjust the seat.
- Yes.

137
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,400
Right, let's do this.

138
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,680
And she's off. Short-shifting
away from the line to manage the traction

139
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,760
and immediately onto the Isn't.

140
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,120
Total focus there.

141
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,840
A deliberately wide line
round the first corner,

142
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,480
working the tyres hard
on this cold, tricky track.

143
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,640
Flying down to Your Name Here.

144
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,360
God, that thing sounds good.

145
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,040
Ooh, getting a bit of tyre squeal there.

146
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,200
And then hammer down up the
hill and back onto the Isn't.

147
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,800
This is so quick.

148
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,160
A dab of brakes. Down the box
to keep the fire lit.

149
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,520
Now up to the slow and
technical Old Lady's House.

150
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,200
Avoiding any understeer there.

151
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,440
Interesting, she's got the car in track
mode but the dash is in full screen.

152
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,640
Clearly that's what
proper drivers prefer.

153
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,360
Even with the air brake up, clearly
needs some managing under braking.

154
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,120
Just the last corner to go now.

155
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,440
Slices through there
and across the line!

156
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,040
It looked good.
It looks fast.

157
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,480
Right, let's see where it
goes on the leader board.

158
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,800
Here we go, up it goes.
Quicker than the GTR.

159
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,040
Ooh! Now, that's
quite interesting, isn't it,

160
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,920
because what we've deduced
from that is the car you loved

161
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,040
is no faster
than the car it has replaced.

162
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,240
Yeah, yeah. That is a bit weird.
The only thing I can think of

163
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,400
is the 650 was on Super Trofeo tyres
which are super sticky, wasn't it?

164
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,160
And that 720 was on normal road tyres.
It makes a difference.

165
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,000
- That is actually quite a good explanation.
- Thank you.

166
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,440
Well it's either that
or it's no better.

167
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,840
Anyway, shut up,
because now it's time for us

168
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,160
to plant a sampling of chat
on Conversation Street.

169
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,040
And it is an unusual
Conversation Street this week.

170
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,400
Because it's the end of the year
we're doing our awards, OK,

171
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,200
or as we call them, the Nigels.

172
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,440
We start actually with, well,
we're calling it

173
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,920
the Nissan Juke Award for
the Worst Car of the Year.

174
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,840
Nominations are, the
Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV.

175
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Why is that on the list?

176
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,320
Well, many, many reasons,
actually, chief among which

177
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,040
is the way it beeps as you're
driving along for no reason.

178
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,720
You just go along
and it goes "beep".

179
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,440
- Ah.
- Nothing's happened, it's just beeping.

180
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,840
- Maybe it's just bored.
- I'd be bored if I was a PHEV, but anyway.

181
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,360
Other nominations include
the Mini Countryman

182
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,160
and the Renault Kadjar.

183
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,600
And the winner is...

184
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,360
It's the Nissan Juke!

185
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,160
There you go!

186
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,720
- A deserved award.
- Oh, yeah, it is.

187
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,720
The judges were particularly impressed
with its consistent awfulness.

188
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,240
It was awful when it was first
launched seven years ago

189
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,440
and it continues to be awful to this day.
Well done, the Nissan Juke.

190
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,440
Do you know what that car is?
It's a wacky vicar.

191
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,880
It's more like the sort
of vicar that will go,

192
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,400
"I've just been on My Face, and do
you know who else was there? Jesus!"

193
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,320
- Yeah.
- That's what it is.

194
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,240
Next it is
the Hard Ass To Follow Nigel.

195
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,400
This is given to the car with
the worst-looking rear end.

196
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,320
The nominations are
the Honda Civic Type R.

197
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
- Oh, I like that.
- No, you're wrong.

198
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,520
That is well wrong. It's just a
car they wouldn't stop designing.

199
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,200
Look how many spoilers
they put there.

200
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,560
"We'll have one here and one
here and one there and there,

201
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,560
and we'll have the one exhaust,
two exhausts, three..."

202
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,800
It's a bit like your jacket. They just
didn't know when to stop adding bits,

203
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,600
unnecessary, pointless,
stupid things to it.

204
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,440
I might be in with a shout.

205
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,760
The next nomination
is the Toyota C-HR.

206
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,000
A car styled by nine people
who'd fallen out at a wedding.

207
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,440
But the winner of the Hard
Ass To Follow Nigel is...

208
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,640
Ooh! It's
the Land Rover Discovery!

209
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
Look at that!

210
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,720
I think the problem is the
designer Gerry McGovern...

211
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,520
Can we get
a picture of him here?

212
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,520
And this is his dog.

213
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,720
- This is where he lives.
- It all makes sense.

214
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,760
So it's only natural his car
should look like that.

215
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,600
It's just all hunched up.
Now we have a special award.

216
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,760
It goes to a car that you like
but you know you shouldn't

217
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,080
cos it would be
a bit embarrassing.

218
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,920
We're calling it the "You Would But
You Know You Shouldn't" Award.

219
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,760
Sarah Palin.

220
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,640
Oh, yeah!

221
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,760
It is the new - next year's
one, actually - Corvette ZR1.

222
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,560
That is...

223
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,280
That fits the bill perfectly.

224
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,400
That is exactly right, because
you would buy one cos, "Wow!"

225
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,800
And then the next morning you'd wake
up and think, "What have I done?"

226
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,680
We're moving on now to the
Lack of Continuity Award.

227
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Nobody's gonna beat me on that.

228
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,960
You were nominated for your
mid-season haircut, that's true,

229
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,360
but you were
beaten by Richard Hammond!

230
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,520
Hold on.
Why was he beaten by me?

231
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,560
Well...

232
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,320
I would invite you all now to
pay careful attention to...

233
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,640
well, actually a clip from the
McLaren film that you saw earlier.

234
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,200
This was an early edit, OK. See if
you can spot something wrong here.

235
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,800
On the head-turn-o-meter this
thing definitely matches

236
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,040
the Ferrari 488 and the
Lamborghini Huracán.

237
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,760
And then when we move onto the subject of
power and speed it actually beats them.

238
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,840
- A deserving winner.
- You switched to a completely different car.

239
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah.

240
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,640
Which brings us
on to the next award...

241
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,960
- Oh, no.
- Yes, you'll like this.

242
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,320
It's for Accidentally Filling Up the Petrol
Tank of a Supercar With Water Award.

243
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,360
Oh, God.

244
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,520
How in the name of all
that's holy did you do that?

245
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,880
- Well, it's interesting...
- Is it?

246
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,080
It was running low on fuel
at the track,

247
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,200
and rather than take it off to a
petrol station which is miles away,

248
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,360
I filled it
from one of the jerry cans.

249
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,200
- Which was full of water?
- Yes.

250
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,080
- And you didn't notice?
- No.

251
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,400
- When did you notice?
- When the tea started tasting funny, I suppose?

252
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,720
It's, it's...

253
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,560
It was when
the engine sort of let go.

254
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,840
How many supercars have you
destroyed this year, Hammond?

255
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,440
Two.

256
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,000
Two?
How many have you driven?

257
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Two.

258
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:57,320
Well, anyway, I'd like to present you
with your Nigel for Appalling Continuity.

259
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
- There you are.
- Thank you.

260
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,360
- Richard Hammond.
- Thank you very much.

261
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,520
That concludes the awards and that concludes
Conversation Street for this week.

262
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,160
Moving on. After every single film
we ever show on The Grand Tour

263
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,920
we always get a load of messages
from people on social media...

264
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,760
I say "people", I mean
teenagers,

265
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,040
saying that
they didn't like the film

266
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,600
cos it was too scripted,
too faked and too set-up.

267
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,480
Yeah. I've got
one of them here.

268
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,800
It's from Monaro Boy 4541

269
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,320
who says, "I hated that thing
you did in Morocco

270
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,680
because it was too scripted. Why can't
you do stuff like you did in Portugal?

271
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,120
Which I also hated
because it was too set-up."

272
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,720
Yes, so we decided to make
a completely unplanned film.

273
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,840
No scouts going ahead
to find locations,

274
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,280
no pre-scripted exchanges
between us,

275
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,680
no set-up explosions.

276
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,280
No. All we agreed on was that we should
do whatever it was we were going to do...

277
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,080
in Croatia.

278
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,240
We chose to meet
in the town of Zadar,

279
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,680
next to its famous sea organ.

280
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,960
Not realising that this
wave-powered machine

281
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,320
makes a terribly annoying noise.

282
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,920
But I ploughed on regardless.

283
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,960
This is an Audi TT RS.

284
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,440
Four-wheel drive,
five-cylinder, turbo-charged,

285
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,080
two-and-a-half-litre engine,

286
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,520
nought to 60,
three and a half seconds.

287
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,600
Really you can think of it
as a Nissan GTR

288
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,200
in a Bauhaus baby-gro suit...

289
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,480
No, that doesn't work, hang on.

290
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,560
Sorry, I normally think...

291
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,440
I normally think of this before I get here.
Hang on. It's a...

292
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,200
It's a GTR...

293
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,120
with a well-groomed
scrotum? No, that's...

294
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,040
Before I'd had chance to come
up with the right words...

295
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,000
...Richard Hammond arrived
in an Ariel Nomad.

296
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,840
This is an Ariel Nomad.

297
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,640
I know, I've already said
that in voice-over.

298
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,480
Why didn't you bring a Porsche?

299
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,200
You could have brought
that Porsche...

300
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,240
What is it? The new one?

301
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,960
No, the one that was the
Cockster that is now the 97 one?

302
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,440
- Uh, the 718?
- Yes, that. Why didn't you bring that?

303
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Because I brought this.

304
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,160
Nobody's gonna say, "Shall I buy
an Audi or some scaffolding?"

305
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,880
I grant you, it's...
No, because they're both...

306
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,920
- What?
- Cars?

307
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,960
Are they the same price? No. Do
they have the same performance? No.

308
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Are they for the same thing?
No.

309
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,280
As we argued about our mismatched
cars, James arrived...

310
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,880
...in an even more
mismatched Lada Riva.

311
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,600
Well, that's not gonna
work, is it? I mean...

312
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,760
This is... a Lada Riva.

313
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
We know. We've already said.

314
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,800
- I'm talking to the viewers.
- Yeah, but they already know, don't they?

315
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,440
- I said it in voice-over.
- You haven't said voice-over yet.

316
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,120
Yeah, he's done voice-over.
He said mine in voice-over as well.

317
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,400
This is whatever Jeremy said
it was. And I paid just £800,

318
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,000
which leaves me £1,200 for the
all-important modifications.

319
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
- And that is plenty.
- Hey?

320
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,240
What modifications?

321
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,600
The modifications to turn
them into fire engines.

322
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,000
We're gonna turn
them into fire engines.

323
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,240
Who said anything
about turning...

324
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,040
Turn your car into a fire engine
using the money you haven't spent

325
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,520
out of the budget on the car.
I've spent £800.

326
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,560
Well, I just borrowed that
from Audi.

327
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,440
I made a phone call.
"Can I borrow a Nomad?"

328
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,920
If you don't turn it into a fire
engine, you won't win the competition.

329
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,880
- I'm not in the competition.
- You are in the competition!

330
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,520
James, we have tried time
and again to think of a way

331
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,120
to turn something into an amusing
fire engine. It can't be done.

332
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,160
The fire engine already
exists. It's brilliant.

333
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,680
It's already more compact
than you'd expect,

334
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,240
faster than you'd expect, you can fit
the firemen in it, and the water.

335
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,720
- And they work very well.
- Exactly. That's the challenge.

336
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,960
You're only saying you're not gonna
turn that into a fire engine

337
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,520
- because it's an air hostess car.
- It is not.

338
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,560
Have you checked the boot
to make sure the luggage

339
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,080
hasn't moved during the journey?

340
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,480
Then our unscripted film
got even more unscripted.

341
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,200
Can I have a selfie?

342
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
- Um, well...
- OK.

343
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,720
That's really up to you
if it's a selfie! I mean...

344
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,880
If I do it, I'll get us
all in. I'm better at this.

345
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
- I can get everybody in.
- Could it maybe wait?

346
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
- There you go.
- Brill.

347
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,000
Come on, let's do whatever
we're doing. Doors to manual.

348
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,800
- Cross check.
- OK.

349
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,720
No air hostess jokes.

350
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,680
- Is that seat back upright?
- Where are we going?

351
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,480
Well, let's just go.
This is the point at which we set off.

352
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,440
We always do that.
Chat, chat...

353
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,640
There'll be a line of voice-over. I'll
put some voice-over in that says...

354
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,360
Hang on. It'll say,

355
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,360
"Since we weren't able
to decide what we were doing,

356
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,480
- We all went in different directions."
- OK.

357
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,200
Since we weren't able
to decide what we were doing,

358
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,000
we all went
in different directions.

359
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,760
If he'd thought about it
in advance,

360
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,560
Richard would have found a quarry in which
he could test his action-lifestyle Nomad.

361
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,200
But he hadn't. So...

362
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,680
Yeah, we've...

363
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,840
I don't feel I'm exploring the outer
reaches of this car's potential

364
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,880
in this traffic.

365
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,320
Because I had satnav,
I fared better.

366
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,760
And found the perfect road

367
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,200
to open the taps
in this brilliant little TT.

368
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,800
Oh!

369
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:41,240
The engine in this car
is an absolute masterpiece.

370
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,760
You've got as near as makes
no difference

371
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,640
400 horsepower.

372
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,960
And then there's that sort of deep
bass drum of torque all the time.

373
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,760
And listen to the noise
it makes. It sounds like...

374
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,080
It sounds like...

375
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:18,120
um... what does it sound...
It sounds like...

376
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,520
It's like... It sounds like a
bear that's trodden on a plug?

377
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,080
No, a bear would go "ow",
wouldn't it?

378
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,440
Soon I'd got it worked out.

379
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh! Listen to that.

380
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
It sounds like
a happy hippopotamus.

381
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,600
Now you would imagine
that putting

382
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,400
this much power and this much
torque in an Audi...

383
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,120
Hey, Jeremy, do you have
to put your phone in flight mode

384
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,160
when you drive one of those?

385
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,560
Bob the Builder appears to be here in
his scaffolding. Anyway, as I was...

386
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,280
Would you mind checking round your feet to
make sure there's nothing on the floor?

387
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,640
As I was saying,
you would imagine...

388
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,560
Have you folded your tray table
away ready for when you stop?

389
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,960
You would imagine that putting this
much power and this much torque in a TT

390
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,520
would make it wayward
and out of control, but no...

391
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,080
Have you pointed out
the lavatories?

392
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,120
There's nothing for it, I'm gonna have
to lose him, get out of radio range.

393
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,200
Right, Hammond, goodbye,
I'm losing you now.

394
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,160
He probably thinks this is just a
dune buggy with a number plate

395
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,080
that's no good on the road.

396
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,200
I shall now prove
that he's wrong.

397
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,520
Charge!

398
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,880
Well, it looks like we've got
ourselves an unscripted race here.

399
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,880
Ha-ha-ha. Oh. Oh.

400
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,680
Hang on a minute, wait.

401
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,560
Oh...

402
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,800
What?

403
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,600
Where's the road gone?

404
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,200
If we'd sent scouts out last week
to check it out like we usually do,

405
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,440
we'd have known about this
and we wouldn't have done it.

406
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,280
- But we didn't.
- No.

407
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
- So we didn't.
- No.

408
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,240
But the fact is, I really want
to show you how fast this is.

409
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,120
I-I'd like to see it
in my mirror,

410
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,800
but there's just one other
thing before we do that.

411
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,480
- What?
- I'd really like a jumper.

412
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,840
So, the situation is,
we're gonna have a race

413
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,920
after we've bought him a jumper.

414
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,800
- Yeah. Ideally...
- And while we're doing that,

415
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,440
I should imagine in the edit they'll
cut back to James in his stupid Lada.

416
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,800
Yeah.

417
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,640
While those two were bumbling
about, I'd found a workshop...

418
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,240
Good.

419
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,560
...and some health
and safety-obsessed locals...

420
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,960
...so I could convert my Lada
into a fire engine. Oh, yes!

421
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,360
Meanwhile,
back in the 21st century,

422
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,920
Hammond had bought his jumper

423
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,520
and we were looking for somewhere
to have our drag race.

424
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,560
It's a dual carriageway.

425
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,640
No, it's got buses on it.

426
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,160
We can't race
where there's buses.

427
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,640
And there was
another problem as well.

428
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,000
It was obviously
a slow news week in Croatia,

429
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:31,800
so we were being followed everywhere
by the paparazzi, and TV crews.

430
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,840
We can't do it here.
Everybody is filming us.

431
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,400
This is impossible. How are
you supposed to have a bloody race?

432
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,200
Hammond, just pull over here.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

433
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,320
Three, two, one, go.

434
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,960
Stop, stop. Abort, abort.
He's paparazzi.

435
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,440
We can't do it here.
It will be in the Daily Mail.

436
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,960
Luckily though, Hammond then had
a sudden burst of intelligence.

437
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Look, there's an airport sign.

438
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,320
Oh, yes.
Well spotted, Mr Hammond.

439
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,800
Well, that's where we always
have drag races, isn't it?

440
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,120
Business as usual.

441
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

442
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,320
However...

443
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,680
There's a man with a...
This is like a news crew here.

444
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,800
- You're joking?
- Hello.

445
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,960
- We're just having a drive.
- Don't tell them we're doing a drag race.

446
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,360
You just said that on the radio!

447
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,040
- Hello.
- Hello. Are you having a nice time?

448
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,960
Very nice, thank you.
Look. So you can't be cross with me.

449
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,600
- You love Croatia?
- Absolutely, yes.

450
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,640
So, we're... we're just having
a drive around.

451
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,680
Thanks.

452
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,480
Yeah.

453
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,280
Right, runway's there.
Jeremy's gone in to ask permission.

454
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,560
Drag race, humiliation,
end of, move on.

455
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
Ah, nobody in?

456
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,720
No. He says
it's a commercial airport,

457
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,680
they're not gonna suspend flight
operations for us to do a drag race.

458
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,600
- I mean he has got a point.
- Yeah, I suppose so, but...

459
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,240
Well...

460
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,760
He also said if we had rung
a couple of weeks ago,

461
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,760
he might have been able
to sort something out.

462
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
- There's a reason why we do that.
- Exactly!

463
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,720
Here's how I'd sum up
unscripted television.

464
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:22,120
You could sit and film a waste disposal
unit all day long and every day long

465
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,800
and transmit the pictures, hoping
that one day a cat will fall into it,

466
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,040
or you could actually push a cat
into it and get it over with.

467
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,680
Whilst James continued with his
stupid fire engine conversion,

468
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,280
Richard and I drove about
until eventually...

469
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,200
...we found
an abandoned runway.

470
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,920
- Right, ready!
- Do the tension thing before the race.

471
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,640
Oh, OK.

472
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,440
Rev the engine.

473
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,440
Yeah, he's got 400 brake
horsepower but his car is heavy.

474
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,280
This only has
290 brake horsepower

475
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,320
but it only weighs 670 kilos.

476
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,600
So in actual fact this has
400 brake horsepower per ton.

477
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,400
That doesn't.

478
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,320
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
Hang on, Hammond?

479
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,400
How are we going to start it?

480
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,680
Normally we have a production member with
a chequered flag. We haven't got that.

481
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,560
We'll start it on the radio. That's what
we'll do, we'll start it on the radio.

482
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,320
I'll do it, OK?
No, wait a minute, hang on.

483
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,120
No, I can't do it, I've got launch control,
I need both hands.

484
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,760
I can't do it,
I have to put the radio away

485
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,040
before I set off.
I've got nowhere to put it.

486
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,280
Shall we... why don't
we just get a local person?

487
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah, that's not difficult,
for somebody just to wave a flag. Yes.

488
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,800
Right, we'll cut back to James

489
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,520
and then when we get back
we'll have a local person.

490
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,440
With Hammond
and Clarkson's camera crew

491
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,520
looking for a local person to
start their pointless race,

492
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,280
I was finally in business.

493
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,360
So, here we are. Just a few hours and
exactly £1,200 later, my fire engine.

494
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,120
My colleagues have been
very quick to point out

495
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,080
that the fire engine as a concept
is very well established,

496
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,600
but this is something different.
You don't call the fire brigade.

497
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,360
I patrol in your area and you summon
me if you need a fire putting out.

498
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,520
Like an ice-cream van. And
to that end I have a siren.

499
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,040
There is a large range of
fire-fighting accoutrements on board.

500
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,800
There are various hoses. We've got CO2 for
electrical fires, fire blankets, sand.

501
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,800
There's a water cannon here. See,
if I just turn on that pump,

502
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,720
steer with my knees, and
put on the windscreen wipers,

503
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,400
and extinguish the fire.
There you go.

504
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,920
And a lot of it comes through
the window and it... Jeez.

505
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,760
Yeah, it's quite...
I may have made it

506
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,760
a bit more complicated
than it needs to be.

507
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,840
All I needed now
was a fire to put out.

508
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,760
And since this was an unscripted film,
it had to be a real one.

509
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:11,400
I'm going to put my light on, and my
siren, just in case anybody needs me.

510
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,560
As Mr Softee
continued to drive round

511
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,520
looking for an unscripted fire,

512
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,520
our camera crew had found a typical
Croatian to start our race.

513
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
It didn't work,
we didn't go anywhere.

514
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,720
Um, oh, yeah.

515
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,600
I-I dunno where I was.
My mind was elsewhere.

516
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,800
I've had another idea.
Why don't we use her as the finish line

517
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,520
and then get, I don't know,
a sound recordist to do the start?

518
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,840
Yeah. That works.

519
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,120
OK, problem sorted.
We have our starter.

520
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,240
We've lost the distraction,
in quite a big way, actually.

521
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,680
Three, two, one, go!

522
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,960
I just cooked my clutch.

523
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,680
Ah.

524
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,680
That is
one hell of a finishing line.

525
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,000
Back at the start line,
the news was bleak.

526
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,040
I think I've broken
that drive shaft end.

527
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,600
As spare parts
had to be sourced,

528
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,160
I decided to take the finishing line
for a spin, in my functioning Audi.

529
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,320
- Woo-hoo!
- Hammond?

530
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,080
I need to go to feed my pet.

531
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,120
She's got to go
and feed her cat.

532
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,600
Right. You go off with the
old man, I'll fix the car.

533
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,920
Fire service
is now available in your area.

534
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,000
Back in town, Fireman May

535
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,760
still hadn't found
anything to put out.

536
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
A kiosk, not on fire.

537
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,360
Ice-cream shop, not on fire.
People with shopping, not on fire.

538
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,080
Are you having a fire?
Your last chance to summon

539
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:28,440
the local fire brigade if
your mobile phone is ablaze.

540
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,880
James eventually realised
that in an unscripted world

541
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,480
he wasn't going to find a fire.
So he deployed his acting.

542
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:42,120
Wait! Smoke! It looks as if
somebody's bin's caught fire.

543
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,920
Not to worry,
I can deal with that.

544
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,480
Several hours later,
with my car fixed,

545
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,480
we were finally ready
for our showdown.

546
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,800
- Let's do it, then.
- OK, let's do this.

547
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,600
Let's sort this out.

548
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,680
Three, two, one!

549
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,120
Come on, baby, come on!

550
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,080
Oh-ho-ho!

551
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,160
No! Where's he come from?
Oh, no!

552
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,520
What's that?

553
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,240
Since when did a finishing line
have an opinion on a result?

554
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,440
I'm better than him.

555
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,000
I don't know why you're
applauding, I really don't,

556
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,600
because there you are,
Monaro Boy,

557
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,800
that is what unscripted
television looks like.

558
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,840
You've got
17 minutes of film there.

559
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,040
All we did was buy a jumper -
which was actually a sweatshirt -

560
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,080
- It was.
- and have a ten-second drag race. That's all we did.

561
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,280
Hang on a minute.
I built a fire engine.

562
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,120
Yeah, but it wasn't
a very good fire engine.

563
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,360
- Yes, it was.
- I'm sorry, James,

564
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,640
but your water cannon
would only be any use

565
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,440
at putting out a fire if the fire
were on your windscreen wipers.

566
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,600
Anything further away than
that would be hopeless.

567
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,760
- I put out that bin fire.
- Yeah, the bin fire that you started.

568
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,440
I did not start it.

569
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,000
- Yes, you did.
- I might have done a bit.

570
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,640
You did a lot. Anyway, listen,
we'll pick that up later on.

571
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,160
Now, though, it's time
for Celebrity Face Off.

572
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,440
And once again we're asking
an important question.

573
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,240
Who is the fastest classical
singer in the world

574
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,720
who has an interesting connection
to the British motor industry?

575
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,680
Many, many people we could
have gone to for this one,

576
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,880
but in the end we selected two.

577
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,320
And they are, and would you
please welcome them now,

578
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,400
Michael Ball and Alfie Boe!

579
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,520
Gentry men.

580
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Thank you very much.

581
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,880
How are you? Have a seat.
You can go in either way.

582
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,720
Both British this week.

583
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,840
Welcome gentlemen,
welcome, welcome.

584
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,840
Now, I've just described you
as classical singers

585
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,200
but actually that's not strictly
true, is it? You're not...

586
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,760
- Well, it is for me. He's...
- I'm not.

587
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,720
But classical music, how was it
described in that movie In The Loop?

588
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,080
It was all vowels? Which it is,
"aa-ee-aa-uu-uu". Nobody likes classical music.

589
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,040
Do that again?

590
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,400
Do you wanna come on tour?

591
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,480
Whatever your music is, however,
it is unbelievably popular.

592
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,400
Last Christmas you were number
one, with your joint album,

593
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,600
and that kept The Stones and Little
Mix, whoever the hell they are,

594
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,560
off the number one,
and then this year,

595
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,200
your album's keeping,
who is it, the Stereophonics?

596
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,240
Yeah, we went
to number one again.

597
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,800
And it's still...
it's doing all right.

598
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,840
Cos I was looking... I was thinking,
so what sort of music is it?

599
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,400
And I was looking on YouTube,
at clips of you two singing.

600
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,120
The audience is quite... old.

601
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,200
Those are Michael's fans.

602
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,560
Are they Michael's fans? They're the
ones that... Do they smell of urine?

603
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,920
- No!
- No?

604
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,800
OK, we were just waiting,
they were...

605
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,680
One of your audience said that

606
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,560
they'd bought our album, so there
is someone here who has our album.

607
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,440
- Who is it?
- Where is she?

608
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,960
Well, "she", there's a surprise.

609
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,320
- Come on, where are you?
- She's now denying it.

610
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,800
Yeah, she's denying it. She's surrounded
by a load of bikers, that's why!

611
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,640
We've got to get onto these
connections with the motor industry

612
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,280
cos that's what people
are interested in here,

613
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,240
which is a genuinely fascinating thing
that we've managed to find with you two.

614
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,760
- We'll start with you if we may.
- Sure.

615
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,880
Michael, your dad was world sales
chief for British Leyland.

616
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,160
That's where he ended. He started off as
an Austin apprentice back in the '50s

617
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,560
and eventually ended up
as world sales chief at BL

618
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,280
under Michael Edwardes and
the whole Red Robbo scenario,

619
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,160
and when they actually
went bust. So...

620
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,360
So you grew up in
a British Leyland household?

621
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,480
- Totally, yeah.
- So how did you ever get to school?

622
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,400
We did have some dogs.
We even had some...

623
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,400
Well, did they make anything
that wasn't a dog?

624
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,600
No.

625
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,360
My favourite one
had to be the Allegro Equipe.

626
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,880
The ugliest car,
with the "Go Faster" stripe.

627
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,520
Yellow and brown
"Go Faster' stripe".

628
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,200
And matching nylon interior.

629
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,120
Didn't your dad progress up to things
like E-Types and what have you?

630
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,160
Yeah, yeah. I remember him
crashing the E-Type.

631
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,440
Taking me to school, funnily
enough. Third day he had it

632
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,320
and someone
into the back of him,

633
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,040
he went into the back of,
well, underneath a lorry.

634
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,440
There's a lot of nose to go under a lorry,
let's be honest, with an E.

635
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,440
The fascinating thing is
he launched the Mini.

636
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,800
He was the guy, he was given
a 500-quid budget.

637
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,400
He was taken in by Issigonis
and all of them, they said,

638
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,040
"This is the car, we want to make
some headlines. Do a thing with it."

639
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,720
And he came up with
this concept of "It's Magic"

640
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,160
and put on one of the
first-ever car launches.

641
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,680
Didn't he do the thing about how
many things can you get in a Mini?

642
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,760
That's right.
That's absolutely right.

643
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,400
Which became a huge thing, for those
of us old enough to remember,

644
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,120
they were always seeing what
they could get in a Mini.

645
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,640
800 Boy Scouts.

646
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,400
I'm gonna move it on, if I may,
to, not your dad, but you...

647
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,760
actually worked
on the shop floor at TVR?

648
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,000
I did. I started off... I was there
for about two or three years.

649
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,440
There are some questions I've
got about TVR, because I...

650
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,120
As I understand it, people
who worked on the shop floor

651
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,280
would often,
before the cars were painted,

652
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,520
or underneath the carpets on the
boot floor, leave rude messages.

653
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,000
- Yeah.
- Is that true?

654
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,440
Absolutely! There's a guy driving
around in a TVR Griffith

655
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,000
with, on the bonnet,
with a big penis shape on it.

656
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
- Underneath.
- Before it was painted?

657
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,800
Yeah. And there's a car door
somewhere with "Alfie is a twat".

658
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,000
I think I've got that one!

659
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,240
They basically got some
things right about TVR, so...

660
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,080
You always think, they couldn't
possibly have done this?

661
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,880
If you've got a TVR and you lift
up the carpet in the boot...

662
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,040
There'll be a message
somewhere, yeah.

663
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,360
Wasn't it a way of passing
messages onto one another down...

664
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,160
Well, there wasn't really
a production line, but...

665
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,240
Yeah, that was the, you know,
the flatting shop would pass

666
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,760
a message down to the paint shop, and, yeah,
usually rude and annoying, but, yeah.

667
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,840
Didn't they used to spray
the backs of your heads?

668
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,800
Yeah, they'd come up to you and just
straight across the back of your neck.

669
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,320
With the paint? Which was
cyanide? Yeah, it was.

670
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,280
Cyanide-based paint, yeah!
Yes!

671
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,040
I came out in a bit of a
rash, but I'm all right now!

672
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,160
Why did they use cyanide paint?

673
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,520
Just cos it was the metallic feel
that they'd get from it. That real...

674
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
- Like a metal flake thing?
- Yeah.

675
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,240
So that must have hurt? Well,
being sprayed in cyanide?

676
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,800
It did a little bit.
It stung for a while.

677
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,400
The worst thing was being shoved through
the powder coating room. That was...

678
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,720
That really... that really
got under your skin.

679
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,960
That itched like crazy,
that did. That was rough.

680
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,080
It's a wonder TVR went out
of business, isn't it?

681
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,800
It makes you wonder,
"How did that happen?"

682
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,480
Cos they had the engine, presumably
your dad's engines, weren't they?

683
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,080
Cos they were using
the V8s from... Rover V8s?

684
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,960
Yeah. They built this engine bay and
they mounted this engine on a plinth

685
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,680
and then stuck the exhaust
into this metal box,

686
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,480
bricked around the metal box, fired it up
on the first test of one of the engines,

687
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,880
and they didn't turn
the extractor fan on.

688
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,600
Oh, God!

689
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,680
So this metal box was turning
into this huge bomb, basically.

690
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,120
It backfired, lit up everything,
bricks flying everywhere.

691
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,800
All the paintwork, cars were
smashed to pieces with bricks,

692
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,200
and the metalworking, the foreman came
up and said, "What the wrong?"

693
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,960
He said, "Just get on with it. Come on, clean
up, we're all right." And that was it.

694
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Was anyone ever killed there?

695
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,200
Not as I...
Oh, there was a guy, yeah.

696
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,040
Yeah, he...

697
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,160
I think...

698
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
- We're laughing.
- Yeah, I know, it was crazy.

699
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,480
Yeah. He did, he went in the
spray booth without his mask on

700
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,000
and just started spraying and
keeled over and that was it.

701
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,040
So he disposed of himself
with cyanide?

702
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,520
Yeah. It was crazy.
Well, the paint job was good.

703
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,920
He said, "Ooh, I've done it."

704
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,320
So how did you get from there
to singing?

705
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,080
Well, I was working in the factory
and working on a Griffith

706
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,000
and I was polishing it away

707
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,800
and this guy was overhearing
me singing along to the radio,

708
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,800
and he said, you know,

709
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,120
"You've got a good voice, you should
try out for this company in London."

710
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,560
And I took the day off work,
went down to London and...

711
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,600
sang for this company
and got taken on.

712
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,280
Came back to TVR, handed in my
notice, and my foreman went crazy.

713
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,440
He said, "What do you wanna
go and do that for? Singing?"

714
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,240
He said, "Why do you wanna leave this job?
You're on 60 quid a week."

715
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,200
Well, there we are, then.

716
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,080
Didn't you try to get Michael to give
you a leg up in the music business?

717
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,280
When I was at college, I stayed
in the same area of London

718
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,240
that he was living at the
time, I was renting a room,

719
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,840
and I posted a note through his door to see
if he'd give us a bit of advice and...

720
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,680
never heard a thing.

721
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,040
- See, you look nice.
- Oh, I know.

722
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,200
You have that nice-looking face, but
actually there beats a cold heart.

723
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,080
Oh, I'm a cold bastard.

724
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,760
Absolutely. I mean, no, I
still haven't given him any.

725
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,280
Could you remember it? You
don't remember the postcard?

726
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,440
- No!
- But your house burnt down?

727
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,920
- Yeah, it did.
- Did you do that?

728
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,360
Probably! When I didn't hear anything from
him, you know. It's the only way forward.

729
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,960
So, anyway, you're here, in the
depths of the English countryside,

730
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,640
and how did it go on the track?

731
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,480
I'm dreading this.
I'm so nervous.

732
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,000
Are you?
I loved every second.

733
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,120
I was told there is quite a bit of
needle between who is the fastest today?

734
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,520
Yeah.

735
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,760
And there's a big dinner
riding on this.

736
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,000
- A really major dinner.
- Who shall we go with first?

737
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,160
Let's have a look at...

738
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,400
- Michael's lap.
- OK.

739
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,200
Here we are. And it's a
smooth start. Up into second.

740
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,400
- Pedal to the metal.
- Well, pedal to the carpet.

741
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,440
Now, I like to brake
half way through this one.

742
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,240
And you do as well.

743
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,560
I think it makes sense cos then you've got
more speed going onto the tricky bit,

744
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,280
which is coming up now,

745
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,120
cos we've run out of money
and there it is, the gravel.

746
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,480
Really, keeping it quite tidy
through there,

747
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,160
and tidy through there as well.

748
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,680
Who the hell
puts gravel on a race track?

749
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,720
I told you,
we haven't got the money.

750
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,360
Right, now, this is the...
I can't remember what it's called.

751
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,360
Gravelsel, that's what it is,

752
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,680
Named after the Carousel of the
Nürburgring. Onto difficult bit two.

753
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,480
Is that any good?

754
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,880
- That's pretty good
- It's quite slow.

755
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,600
Cos sometimes
if you keep it tidy

756
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,920
and it looks slow,
it's actually fast.

757
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,960
That's a hard corner. Cos it always
is more slippery than you think.

758
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,480
Right, now, smoothly onto
the main stra...

759
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,520
Well, not smoothly,
virtually stopping.

760
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,480
I'm loving this!

761
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,360
Good. Now this is supposed to be
flat but it's quite greasy today,

762
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,920
so you probably wouldn't be.
You definitely aren't.

763
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,600
Right,
final corner coming up now...

764
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,640
Ooh, more understeer, not as bad as last week.
But there we are, across the line!

765
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,880
- I mean...
- Well, who knows?

766
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,200
- I didn't crash.
- You definitely didn't crash.

767
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,280
Slow and steady wins the race.

768
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,320
Or gets around. What's that?

769
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,480
These are the times. But we're not gonna
reveal them until we've had a look at

770
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,400
Alfino, as we liked to call you all week,
when you were coming off.

771
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,880
Right, let's have a look at
Alfie's lap.

772
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,360
- Oh, fog's come down.
- He gets special effects.

773
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,360
Right, and he's disappeared.

774
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,440
All right, Bally,
I'm coming after you.

775
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,160
God, that really is a pea souper.
Could you see all right?

776
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,200
- No, it was...
- Ooh, there's an excuse, Alfie.

777
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,440
- You should say, "Yes, easily".
- It was easy. I was fine.

778
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,920
That's nice and smooth through there.
Now, are you exuberant on the gravel?

779
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,480
Let's have a look,
as we come up here.

780
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,800
Ooh, that's wide!

781
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,720
This gravel turn is as wide
as Michael's vibrato.

782
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,680
That traction control is really
letting you have some angle there

783
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,920
as we come now
to Difficult Bit Two.

784
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,680
Cutting that corner nicely,
sliding wide on that one.

785
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,800
Very different styles
you two have got here.

786
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,760
God, that really is fishtailing down there.
Onto the tarmac once again.

787
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,920
We'll ignore that.

788
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,960
That's illegal!

789
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,160
You almost stopped as well.
Now, here we go.

790
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,160
Yay!

791
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,080
I never would have had
you as a swearist. Right, now...

792
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,120
That seems fast but wide.

793
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,560
Ooh, he's off, he's off!

794
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,200
No, he's back on.
And stopping. Why? No, not...

795
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,360
Virtually stopping.

796
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,080
And then across the line.

797
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,520
I actually don't like this bit,

798
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,160
having to reveal the times to two
people when it really matters.

799
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,480
- Really matters.
- It does.

800
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,120
Anyway, I've got the times here.

801
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,160
Are you nervous?
I'm really nervous.

802
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,400
I've shat myself.

803
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,880
It smells like
one of your audiences.

804
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,600
- I've gone again!
- Right.

805
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,600
- Michael Ball.
- Yes.

806
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,920
You did it in one minute...
23.3.

807
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,160
My heart is pounding.

808
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,480
Alfie Boe. One minute...

809
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,120
twenty...

810
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,560
...four point four.

811
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,080
Ooh!

812
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,840
Too exuberant.

813
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,880
I think, too exu...

814
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,920
- You probably had more fun.
- Yeah.

815
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,000
But you were faster.
By actually 1.1 seconds.

816
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,760
1.1 seconds?

817
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,600
- Yeah. Do you want me to say it again?
- Would you mind?

818
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,240
It's not the winning,
it's the taking part!

819
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,440
So there we are,
ladies and gentlemen,

820
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,400
Alfie Boe and the fastest
classical singer

821
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,760
with a connection to the
British motor industry,

822
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,360
- Michael Ball!
- Thank you!

823
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,840
Now, this week
we are in Croatia,

824
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,960
making a totally unplanned
and unscripted film

825
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,880
in which we attempt to turn
cars into fire engines.

826
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,920
No, James, we are not.

827
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,800
Well, I am.
Yes, but to be quite clear,

828
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,000
Jeremy and I are doing something
completely different.

829
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,720
Having proved that my Audi

830
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,800
was faster in a straight line than
Richard's Honda-powered Nomad,

831
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:36,040
I was now determined to show him
it was also faster at rallying.

832
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,680
I'm confident
for several reasons.

833
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,560
It's got four-wheel drive, it's got
a differential that moves the power

834
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,600
to whichever wheel is best able
to handle it at any given moment,

835
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,760
and it has a fabulous gearbox.

836
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,360
But most of all I'm confident because
this is the first Audi I've ever driven

837
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,280
that has a front on it.

838
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:00,680
What I mean by that is it has a front
end that goes where you point it.

839
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,880
You flick the wheel and it goes
in the direction you selected.

840
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,320
There's no understeer. You then have
to sort out the back end, obviously,

841
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:12,320
but that's OK, that's what all top
drivers, such as myself, want.

842
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,040
Does that mad old ape really
believe his air hostess chariot

843
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:28,000
will stand a chance off-road against
this custom-built off-road racer?

844
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:34,840
Has he got £3,000 worth of Fox off-road
long-travel coil-over suspension?

845
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,880
No, he hasn't.

846
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:41,000
Can he glance out the side and see
exactly how his wheels are positioned?

847
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,440
No, he can't. Does he have
a hydraulic handbrake?

848
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,080
No. Does it weigh
just 670 kilograms?

849
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,000
No, he weighs more than that.

850
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:58,160
All we needed to sort this out was
a loose-surface gravel track of some kind.

851
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:04,360
Obviously nothing planned, we just
drive round until we find somewhere.

852
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,800
Can't do it there, too many trees.
That's just a little bit of gravel.

853
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,920
Can't go there,
that's an orchard.

854
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,360
Somebody will be cross.
There must be somewhere!

855
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,040
Meanwhile, after his success
with the staged bin fire,

856
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,000
James was now
getting carried away.

857
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,800
Ah, looks like a job for me.

858
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,400
- My pleasure.
- Ah...

859
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,760
Back out in the countryside,

860
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,280
Richard and I had stopped by
some nice lakes.

861
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:54,360
But, because this was an unscripted film,
we didn't have much to say about them.

862
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,240
I like the waterfalls.

863
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,040
Yeah, the waterfalls are nice.

864
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,760
What's your favourite
of the waterfalls?

865
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,720
- I like that one.
- I like that big one.

866
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,600
- Yep.
- Oh.

867
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,640
Hold that a minute.

868
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,360
Right, I've done a quick chart
of how we're performing so far.

869
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,440
We aren't...?

870
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,800
- I'm not performing.
- Right, Economy.

871
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,840
Three points for me,
most economical obviously,

872
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,280
followed by Hammond, two,
you, one.

873
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,720
Top Speed. It's the other way round.
You're the fastest, three points,

874
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,840
two for you and one for me,
the slowest. Now, Value.

875
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,680
You get a point for every pound
you save under the £2,000 budget,

876
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,840
but you lose a point for every
pound you go over it, OK?

877
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,080
So I am winning that.
My car car was £800.

878
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,720
I score 1,200. You...

879
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,840
Minus 65,000...

880
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,880
- James?
- I think there's something wrong with him.

881
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,680
645.

882
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,720
I can't write on
a vertical surface.

883
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,800
Let's have a writing
competition. You lose!

884
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,160
Hang on, your car, you lose...

885
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,880
Minus 48,000.

886
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,800
- I can't be minus anything.
- Hang on, hang on,

887
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,840
have you included
his optional windscreen?

888
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,880
- Don't encourage him!
- Was that optional?

889
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,920
- It's an optional windscreen.
- How much is it?

890
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,560
1,500 quid.

891
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,360
Minus 1,500.
That's interesting.

892
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,560
Minus minus is a plus,
which is a minus.

893
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,800
James, this is very riveting,
but it's irrelevant.

894
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,880
It's not irrelevant.

895
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,240
It's like saying, "Jeremy, you lost
to Manchester United yesterday."

896
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,440
I wasn't there,
and I wasn't taking part.

897
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,480
- You are taking part in this.
- I'm not.

898
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,520
Yes, you are. Just because you can't
be bothered and you've done it wrong.

899
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:44,160
You're losing. Catch up here.
You've got Fires Extinguished,

900
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,600
Water Capacity. You can still
claw it back for the total.

901
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,560
But at the moment, mate,
you're losing.

902
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,640
Fires Extinguished.
So far I've done two...

903
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,080
Having thrown James's chart
in the lake,

904
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:03,080
Hammond and I resumed
our search for a rally stage.

905
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,880
And soon, we found one.

906
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,560
This would be perfect
for our timed shoot-out.

907
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,200
Hammond elected to go first.

908
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,560
Right, this bush
is the start/finish line, OK?

909
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,600
- OK. Yes.
- Good.

910
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,640
No, hang on.
I don't trust you to time me.

911
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,680
I'm not. Sylvia is.

912
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,520
Oh, great,
the human finish line.

913
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,600
Yes!

914
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,320
Tri...

915
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,680
Go!

916
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,280
This is it.

917
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,080
A little touch of the brakes.

918
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,320
Don't wanna drift too wide.

919
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:52,760
Two-wheel drive means I've gotta take
advantage of every bit of grip I can find.

920
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,360
A lot of rocks!
A lot of rocks!

921
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,920
Come on. Get your
concentration on, Richard!

922
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,600
Now, floor it!
Everything we got!

923
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,600
- Sylvia, what was the time?
- Two minutes, five point seven.

924
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,240
Well, that's...
that's probably brilliant.

925
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,280
Two minutes,
five point seven. Right,

926
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,680
- My turn.
- OK.

927
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,120
Watch and learn.

928
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,040
Go!

929
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:09,440
Right, I have the whole car
set up in its dynamic mode.

930
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,960
So, the throttle response,
the gearbox, the suspension,

931
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,800
they're all now sharper
than an architect's pencil.

932
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,040
Jesus! God's truth.

933
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,880
I am not the world's best
loose-surfaces expert.

934
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,960
I'm not even
in the top 20 million.

935
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,800
But, in a car like this, you feel like
you have all the control you need.

936
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,000
Absolutely unbelievable.
And flick it in.

937
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,760
That front end on this
is just phenomenal.

938
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,520
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

939
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,400
Yes! Go, go! Go, Jeremy!

940
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,560
Oh, yeah, totally unbiased.

941
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,960
- The finish line looks happy.
- Sylvia, what was the time?

942
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,840
Perfect time. Two
minutes, three point seven.

943
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,320
Oh, come on!

944
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,360
That's just because...

945
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,080
She can't mess with time.

946
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,680
Time is just an entity on its own.
You can't mess around with it.

947
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,880
Jeremy!

948
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,920
- Hammond, Hammond?
- No.

949
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,960
Hammond.

950
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,600
May. What, now? Where?

951
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,640
OK. No, yes.

952
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,440
Yes, yes, yes, I've got satnav.
I'll find it. All right, bye.

953
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,360
He says he's organised
a demonstration

954
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,800
and he wants us two
to come and watch it.

955
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,520
- Watch it?
- Yeah.

956
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,960
I'd personally prefer to do
another race of some sort.

957
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
- No, there's no point.
- In a swimming pool, perhaps?

958
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,280
- The finish line is biased.
- On a beach? Why don't we...

959
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,160
No. Let's go. I'd rather go
and see James

960
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,200
than be humiliated by another
biased...

961
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,960
- Why don't we have a race in a sauna?
- No.

962
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:24,920
As James was a fair few miles
away, we had time to sum up

963
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,720
what we'd learned
about our cars.

964
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,600
I know the Audi TT
has an image problem.

965
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,480
I know people think
it's an air hostess's car.

966
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,400
But the RS
genuinely is different.

967
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,520
The RS is like...

968
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,480
Oh, not again. Um...

969
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:49,160
It's like...

970
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,760
It's difficult to think of anyone who
really needs a supercharged Ariel Nomad.

971
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,280
Even an emergency off-road
vet would have nowhere

972
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:01,880
to put their tools to do anything
when they got there, so it's useless.

973
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,200
It's also draughty,
expensive, noisy...

974
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,840
...and brilliant!

975
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,320
I adore it!

976
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:18,360
It's the best toy in the world, and what
finer praise could you have for any car?

977
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:25,200
Eventually we met up with our colleague, who
was eager to explain what he had in mind.

978
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:28,440
I'm making
a simulated bush fire,

979
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,440
the start of a bush fire
to demonstrate

980
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,680
how quickly my roving fire
engine could just put it out

981
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,440
before it develops into something
like a massive conflagration.

982
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:40,240
This bush fire, OK, is going
to start right next to a road.

983
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,960
Which happens to be next to where
you've parked your fire engine?

984
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,200
I'm not... I'm gonna drive in
and put it out.

985
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,920
But you know where it is!
You've just started it.

986
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,760
I know! It's a demonstration,
you morons!

987
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,960
It's two and a half feet
from a road!

988
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,960
Bush fires happen miles out
in the middle of...

989
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,120
All right, go and build one out there.
It doesn't make any difference.

990
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,360
Why don't we go
and start a fire for him?

991
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,200
That's more realistic.
You travel to the fire,

992
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,000
wherever we've started it,
and put it out.

993
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,520
Off you go.

994
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,040
Having travelled a
realistic distance from the road,

995
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:12,040
we soon had
a bush fire on the go.

996
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,360
Ooh, hello. Hello! Hello!

997
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,560
Yes!

998
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,600
That is speeding things up,
isn't it?

999
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,640
Isn't it? There you go.

1000
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,880
What it's doing is catching on. The
wind moves it along and it gets bigger.

1001
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,200
It's quite good.
Another bit there, look.

1002
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,280
Then we told James
to come and do his stuff.

1003
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,320
Relax, I am coming
to put out the fire.

1004
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,240
However, because
of his leisurely pace,

1005
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,760
the fire had grown a bit
by the time he got there.

1006
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,320
Jeez.

1007
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,800
Pressure.

1008
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,520
It's too big!

1009
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,320
I've run out of water!

1010
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,800
This isn't gonna work.

1011
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,840
I think what we've
established here

1012
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,880
is that he's only capable of putting
out fires that he's started himself.

1013
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,920
Yeah, that are nearby
and contained.

1014
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,880
I haven't got anything left!

1015
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:35,240
Luckily, at this point,
the real fire brigade arrive.

1016
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,000
Thank you.

1017
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,600
It's a six-tonne
lump of water...

1018
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,640
Hold on. Hold on, hold on.

1019
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:28,400
Let's have a look at the final scores
on my water-damaged scoreboard.

1020
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,800
No, James.
No, there's no point.

1021
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,000
You get minus a million
cos that was the cost

1022
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,000
of the real fire brigade
that had to come,

1023
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,200
and I get plus a million
for winning everything.

1024
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,520
No, hang on, the only reason
your doors-to-manual Audi

1025
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:44,160
beat the magnificent Nomad is that
you fed the finishing line's cat.

1026
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,600
And because it was faster.
And better in every way.

1027
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:50,440
It is a superb car, that TT,
but you can't have one.

1028
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,200
Because of
the air hostess thing?

1029
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,720
No, because
I've driven three examples

1030
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,360
and every single one
has had squeaky brakes.

1031
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,720
You can hear it in the film,
and it drives you mad.

1032
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,040
Yeah, that's unforgivable.

1033
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,600
And on that terrible disappointment,
and that total waste of time,

1034
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,040
it's time to end. Thank you
very much for watching.

1035
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,800
Have a very happy New Year.

1036
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,960
Unless you're watching this in April,
in which case, whatever. Goodbye.
