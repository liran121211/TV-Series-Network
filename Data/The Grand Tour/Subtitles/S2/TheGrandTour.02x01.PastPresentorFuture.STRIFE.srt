1
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,920
Thank you.

2
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,120
Thank you, everybody.

3
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,480
Thank you.

4
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,200
Thank you.

5
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,120
We're back!

6
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,920
We are back!

7
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,720
Thank you very much,
everyone, and welcome.

8
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,840
Welcome to our
permanent new home

9
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,280
here in the green heart
of England-land.

10
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,640
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!

11
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,880
Can I just say, it's not so
much green as inconvenient.

12
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,400
Why is it inconvenient?

13
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,560
Well, Jeremy,
tell the ladies and gentlemen

14
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,040
why you decided to put
our tent precisely here.

15
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,600
Ah, it is exactly here
because this spot

16
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,360
is exactly half way between May's
house and Hammond's house.

17
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,080
So there is no squabbling

18
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,520
over who had
the longest commute.

19
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,840
Yes, but your house
is just over there.

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,080
I can see it, just there.

21
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,720
I haven't got a house. You
may remember you blew it up.

22
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,600
Oh, all right,
your backup house.

23
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,960
Yeah, your spare house
is just there.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,240
Let's not get bogged down with
whose house is the nearest.

25
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,360
It's yours. Definitely yours.

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,960
Is that your cat?

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,960
The point is...

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,520
Oh, hang on, Jezza,
you've got a parcel.

29
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,320
No, I can tell there's
a man putting one of those

30
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,280
"I can't be arsed to ring the doorbell"
cards through the letterbox.

31
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,320
The tent is located here, yes.

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,200
But this is still very much
The Grand Tour.

33
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,440
The globe is still
our playground,

34
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,000
as you will see
from this short clip

35
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,920
of what's coming up
over the next 11 weeks.

36
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,560
Won't Get Fooled Again

37
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,160
OK, it's time now and...

38
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,160
nobody's ever said this
on a car show before,

39
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,760
to save the world.

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,880
Morning, shoppers.

41
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,040
Oh, my giddy aunt!

42
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,160
Holy shit.

43
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,480
Here they come!

44
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,080
Oh, here we go again!

45
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,560
Way. Get out of the way.
I'm in a race.

46
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,200
Extending fuel nozzle.

47
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,960
We are pumping gas!

48
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,320
Have we got to drive up there?

49
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,440
Fire service is now
available in your area.

50
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,640
Charge!

51
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,840
I'm better than him.

52
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,640
Bollocks!

53
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,600
You're gonna have to work
a bit harder, Jaguar!

54
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,480
We've been busy.
We have been very busy.

55
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,480
Anyway, that...
that is all to come.

56
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,400
This, however, is now.

57
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,560
And we have
an important job to do.

58
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,680
An important question to answer.

59
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,320
Which is better? The past,
the present, or the future?

60
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,520
By which I mean,
which is better -

61
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,240
petrol power, hybrid power,
or electrical power?

62
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,560
Now, to do this, we are going to
use the Lamborghini Aventador S,

63
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,000
which has a petrol engine and is therefore
from the pages of ancient history.

64
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,480
And that will be driven by
our resident Neanderthal.

65
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,240
Representing the present day,
we have the Honda NSX,

66
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,800
which is a modern hybrid.

67
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,040
And that, obviously, will be driven
by somebody crisp and contemporary.

68
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,840
- Me.
- Yeah!

69
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,240
Yeah.

70
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,040
And I shall be driving
something from the future.

71
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,240
An all-electric supercar
from Croatia.

72
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,720
- We know how that ends.
- Yeah.

73
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,040
Yeah.

74
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,680
And... And...

75
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,200
And while we're on...

76
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,600
And while... while we are on
the subject of me,

77
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,520
I decided to take charge of
where we would do this test.

78
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,720
I'm tired of these two picking places
that I don't like or understand.

79
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,840
Which is why this week
The Grand Tour

80
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,600
is off to Switzerland.

81
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,080
Well, here it is.
The Rimac Concept One.

82
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,840
The world's first
electric supercar.

83
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,240
And listen to that. The hills are alive
with the sound of, well, nothing.

84
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,720
It's amazing.

85
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,360
At least it was
until they turned up.

86
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,760
Listen to that.

87
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,960
Look, everything
was better in the past.

88
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,600
Christopher Wren
was a better architect

89
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,040
than those numpties you see
on Grand Designs.

90
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,480
Bob Seger could belt out a
better tune than Justin Bieber.

91
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,520
And this Lamborghini is better
than Hammond's lady shaver.

92
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,880
It just is - in every way.

93
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,360
No, the present is best.

94
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,640
Everything in the world now is
better than it was a minute ago.

95
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,840
Everything in the world now is better
than it's going to be in another minute,

96
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,360
because we don't know
what that is yet.

97
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,520
It might be
the nuclear holocaust.

98
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,480
Human kind can only
live in the present,

99
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,560
and that's why you need
a Honda NSX. OK?

100
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,880
The NSX is by far the cleverest
of the three cars here.

101
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,400
Because of its dual powertrain.

102
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,920
It has the dependability,

103
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,360
the availability,
of fossil fuels.

104
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,800
And the magic and helpfulness,
if you like, of electricity.

105
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,040
It's a hybrid and it
really is rather brilliant.

106
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,600
They probably think this is

107
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,280
some sort of Eastern European electric
milk float in a supercar suit.

108
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,160
Well, they're wrong. Very wrong.

109
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,080
I have four
massive electric motors here.

110
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,000
One for each wheel.

111
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,080
So I'm in
a 1,241 brake horsepower,

112
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,080
all-electric supercar.

113
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,240
The speed in this
is other-worldly,

114
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,080
because it's achieved
so silently.

115
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,440
It's funny, isn't it? I'm
shouting but I don't need to.

116
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,960
I could talk quietly.

117
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,880
Even when I'm accelerating hard.

118
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,000
I know the Rimac is very pretty.

119
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,480
I can see that.

120
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,400
And I know it's very fast.

121
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,080
But I also know...
it can't do this.

122
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,680
Oh, my God!

123
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,240
That is
a six-and-a-half-litre V12.

124
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,400
Turning petrol into noise.

125
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,800
Come on, Hammond, admit it.

126
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,120
That is one hell of a noise.

127
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,760
It is cannon fire.

128
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,880
Fire! Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang.

129
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,960
It is like watching the battle
of Waterloo from a spaceship.

130
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,000
I know it looks like
the three of us are just

131
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,640
clowning around
in some supercars

132
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,600
on a lovely, lovely day,
on a beautiful bit of road,

133
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,720
but this is important work.

134
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,320
It is.

135
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,880
It is.

136
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,120
And to prove it's
important work,

137
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,160
we decided to pull over

138
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,480
and start acting like
important car journalists.

139
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,280
You may mock the idea
of a Croatian supercar,

140
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,480
but Rimac is already working with Koenigsegg
and Aston Martin on their battery tech.

141
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,000
It's a serious company.

142
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,320
So serious that they make nearly
every bit of this car themselves.

143
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,680
Satnav, switch gear,
headlamps - all in-house.

144
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,840
Mm, apart from the leather, if you
go for that, which is Bulgarian.

145
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,160
- I love Bulgarian leather.
- It's my favourite.

146
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,520
But, anyway, the reason
I like the Aventador most

147
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,960
is because it defines
the supercar.

148
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,960
It wasn't designed to do a
billion round Brands Hatch.

149
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,120
It was designed to do 9
on Knightsbridge.

150
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,200
It was designed to make
people go "Wow", and it does.

151
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,600
If you wanna go fast,
buy a Ferrari.

152
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,000
Or a Rimac. -No, that's for shaving
your legs if you're a lady.

153
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,560
I love the Lamborghini as well. The
styling especially, it's fantastic.

154
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,400
But you know that the sort of
time and thought that

155
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,320
Lamborghini put into that,
Honda put into things that

156
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,880
they thought were important,
like making a new type of

157
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,520
steel section for that pillar so it can
be smaller, so you can see out better.

158
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,640
Ten radiators
to cool the drivetrain

159
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,760
and lots of other stuff that make
modern technology simple to use.

160
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,480
I just don't like it.

161
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,640
Well, how is that relevant? I'm
talking about it and I like it.

162
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,360
So you're wrong. -I wanted
to like it, but I don't.

163
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,560
You're redundant. -I didn't...
I really wanted to like it.

164
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,120
I've been ten years looking forward to it.
I wanted to like it.

165
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,600
I got in it, I didn't like it.

166
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,040
- But it doesn't matter because I do.
- You are wrong.

167
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,600
- I'm not wrong.
- You are.

168
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,080
Eventually, we stopped
arguing and set off...

169
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,040
so we could do more arguing
on the move.

170
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,760
So, James,
Honda's hybrid technology

171
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,440
has served them very well in Formula One
the last couple of years, hasn't it?

172
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,280
Has it? I wouldn't
know and I don't care.

173
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,600
Formula One is irrelevant.

174
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,920
And then there are actual details
that are wrong with that car.

175
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,800
Yes, go on.

176
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,240
Well, the gearbox is dim-witted,
the steering's odd,

177
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,960
the sun visor's too flimsy,
the satnav's from a Civic,

178
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,560
and the fuel gauge
isn't straight.

179
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,760
What do you mean, the
fuel gauge isn't straight?

180
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,360
You look at the actual needle.

181
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,000
It's not in the centre
of the dial.

182
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,440
- Yes, it is.
- It isn't.

183
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,440
The actual centre point
of the needle

184
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,640
is higher up
than the middle of the dial.

185
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,560
No, it isn't. The problem is,
when you're driving,

186
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,800
your head, which is too big,
is in the wrong place.

187
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,400
Isn't. It's on top of my shoulders.
Oh, God.

188
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,200
If you got
a measuring tape out -

189
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,520
and I'm sure you will,
cos you're that sort of man.

190
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,280
I don't need to get
a tape measure out.

191
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,120
I have a very good eye for these
things and I can tell you it is.

192
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,120
Welcome to Radio Old.

193
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,560
I think the problem is the needle boss is
slightly proud of the centre of the dial -

194
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,440
because your head's in
the wrong place.

195
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,400
Coming up next, we moan
about the price of things

196
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,960
and how young policemen
are these days.

197
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,440
Nyeh.

198
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,960
There's nothing wrong with the fuel gauge.
What a ridiculous thing to say!

199
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,840
It's so good
to be back doing what we do.

200
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,440
Driving round corners
a bit too quickly

201
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,160
while shouting and bickering.

202
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,840
Sadly, however, things
took a turn for the worse

203
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,680
when we arrived at the hotel

204
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,200
that Hammond had booked.

205
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,600
Here we go. This is our home.

206
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,320
This is gonna be great.

207
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,080
What?

208
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,920
Hammond.

209
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,520
What is a "wellness retreat"?

210
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,120
One of these.

211
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:34,240
More specifically, hang on, it said
Swiss natural detox. What is that?

212
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,080
- It's handy for where we need to be.
- Can we get a drink here?

213
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,080
No.

214
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,040
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

215
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,600
Do you realise that could
result in your death?

216
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,760
- "Could"?
- Yes.

217
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,400
Sorry, will.

218
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,520
- What are you thinking of?
- Why?

219
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,480
It's convenient. It's near
many things I want to be near.

220
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,000
It's the only hotel? -Do
they do colonic here? -Yes.

221
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,400
Would you like to know
what colonic feels like?

222
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,080
The new electric version. -Do
they really do colonic here?

223
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,080
- You might feel better for it.
- I won't feel better for it!

224
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,760
You'll thank me for it in a bit.

225
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,280
Would you like a glass of
water, James, and some kale?

226
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,640
Oh, yes, that's what I
always have for supper.

227
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Over dinner that
night, the mood was dark.

228
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,600
I know people
who eat this stuff.

229
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,080
Do you know what they're called?

230
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,640
Women.

231
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,920
Think how healthy you'll feel
when we get back.

232
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,160
- How long are we here for?
- Four days.

233
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,680
Four days?

234
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,440
I've got a lot of things
planned.

235
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,960
Yeah, but we're gonna starve to
death, Hammond. -No, you won't.

236
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,480
Listen, what this is...
is tough love.

237
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,840
Well, not love for you two,
but it's what you need.

238
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,240
It's tougher hate than usual
is what I'm giving you.

239
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,280
I'm taking you in hand
and for both of your sakes,

240
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,200
turning it around,
turning over a new leaf.

241
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,680
I actually think James
is looking better already.

242
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,000
He's got a healthy glow. -He isn't
looking better. He's looking angrier.

243
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,640
You're gonna look a lot worse in
a minute, I can guarantee that.

244
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,200
Look at the view.
Look at that. Look at that.

245
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
You can't eat that!

246
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,400
Ungrateful sod!

247
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,720
OK, we will pick that up
later on.

248
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,760
Yes. And now it's time for us

249
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,360
to take a stroll down the smooth
sidewalks of Conversation Street.

250
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,040
That was good.

251
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,120
Now, I'd like to begin
Conversation Street

252
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,960
with the world's most
incompetent TV host, James May,

253
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,720
who filmed the entire series...

254
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,000
and as you saw in that sting,
the sting itself,

255
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,920
and in the montage, and in
Switzerland, looking...

256
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,360
Well, with long hair, looking
like a roadie for Steppenwolf.

257
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,520
And then he turned up
this morning

258
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,160
looking like
a geography teacher.

259
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,680
James, have you ever heard of
the concept of continuity?

260
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,440
He had to do it,
had to make a change,

261
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
because he had
his identity stolen.

262
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,160
I did, actually.
That is absolutely true.

263
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,720
I did have my identity stolen.

264
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,000
Somebody got hold of,
you know, personal details,

265
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,120
address and date of birth,
and they've opened, you know,

266
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,320
eight bank accounts
with overdrafts and loans

267
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,000
and all that stuff
that I'd be liable for.

268
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,160
What fascinates me about this
is they had a choice.

269
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,280
They could've been David
Beckham or Brad Pitt.

270
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,640
Yeah, you can look
around the world. Anybody.

271
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,440
I wanna be Barack Obama.
Cool, powerful.

272
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,920
No, wait a minute.

273
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,680
I want to live in Hammersmith
and have a folding bicycle

274
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,640
so that one day,
I can walk out of my house

275
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,680
and say, "Look at me. Behold,
I have become James May."

276
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,840
"And now I will organise your paperclips.
Have you got a pie?"

277
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,960
The good thing is, James...

278
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,120
is we can guarantee this will
never happen to you again.

279
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,520
- Can you?
- Yes.

280
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,400
Because we have come up
with a new name for you.

281
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,720
Yeah. You are now...

282
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,280
Dingleberry Handpump.

283
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,720
Right.

284
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,600
That is your name,
your new identity.

285
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Nobody's gonna steal that cos nobody's
gonna go into a mobile phone shop and say,

286
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,520
"I'd like to set up an account.
My name is Dingleberry Handpump."

287
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,440
- Yes.
- You're completely safe.

288
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,320
It's just that
that's now your name.

289
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,080
- I appreciate that.
- That's OK.

290
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,960
We're moving on with an apology.

291
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,520
And it's for the lateness of
the arrival of this series.

292
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,680
The problem is that since
we were last here,

293
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,480
all three of us, for one reason or
another, have been in hospital.

294
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,680
Uh, Handpump was in for...

295
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,760
I don't know why he was in.
But he was.

296
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,640
Hammond, well, we'll see why later.
And then I had pneumonia.

297
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,280
- Um, this pneumonia of yours.
- Yes.

298
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,160
It's something that people catch from...
going out without your vest on.

299
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,400
- That's what I was told.
- Yes, my mum used to say,

300
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,720
you'd get it if you went out
with wet hair.

301
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,400
Yeah, that sort of thing. And yet, you
somehow managed to catch pneumonia...

302
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,920
on the sun-kissed Mediterranean
isle of Majorca.

303
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,120
Yes, I did. I did.

304
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,760
It's very odd, because he was
out there for five weeks.

305
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,400
He rang us after one,
and he said,

306
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,960
"I can't come home. I've
literally got pneumonia."

307
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,680
- I had.
- And I looked it up.

308
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,240
It was 100 degrees and bone dry.

309
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,440
- And yet you got pneumonia.
- I did catch pneumonia.

310
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,280
After a short while,
if I remember right,

311
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,760
- you managed to get yourself to Ibiza.
- Yes, I did.

312
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,960
I don't remember a news headline
in the papers that said,

313
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,160
"Jeremy Clarkson rushed
to Ibiza with pneumonia."

314
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,640
No, I know I wasn't rushed.
I went on a friend's boat.

315
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,640
"Sadly, Jeremy Clarkson has been
admitted to a luxury yacht..."

316
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,040
This pneumonia of yours that
you suffered from. -Yes? Yes.

317
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,800
Was it at its worst in the
morning when you woke up?

318
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,200
And then did it get better
through the day, every day,

319
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,120
towards the evening, every day?

320
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,440
It was pneumonia,
for crying out loud!

321
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,200
You're mocking the afflicted.

322
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,200
OK, Handpump, why don't you tell the ladies
and gentlemen why you were in hospital?

323
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,080
No, I don't like to make a fuss.
Let's talk about cars.

324
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,760
It's nothing to do with my anus.

325
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,480
Let's just clear that up
in case...

326
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,520
- Um...
- I've got some conversation.

327
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,960
- What?
- Nissan has introduced

328
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,720
some special seats
that record your sweat.

329
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,360
- What?
- I've got a picture of them.

330
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,320
Right, they start blue.

331
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,400
And then they go yellow
where you've been sweating.

332
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,720
Why would you want seats
that do that?

333
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,520
That's a very, very good
question -It's the only question.

334
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,400
Yes. I looked into it. Apparently,
they say it's because

335
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,440
you can tell
when you're dehydrated,

336
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,080
because you've been sweating.

337
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,840
I know when I'm dehydrated.

338
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,080
It's because I feel thirsty
and I need a glass of wine.

339
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,080
Yeah.

340
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,760
Well, be careful with that, you'll get
pneumonia again. -That's how it starts.

341
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,280
That's how it starts.
I know what you mean.

342
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,280
Just don't applaud him.

343
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,360
Handpump.

344
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,320
That is the world's first...

345
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,600
Nissan have come up with the world's
first pneumonia-sensing car seats.

346
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,520
That's absolutely incredible.

347
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,560
I know what you mean.
Our bodies are equipped with

348
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,360
means of telling us that we are
dehydrated without looking at the seat.

349
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,320
Exactly. Exactly. -Like if
you start going for a pee

350
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,760
and just sand comes out,
it's time for some water.

351
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,080
If you're one of those sort of
slightly fat jogger type people,

352
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,520
won't you end up with
like a yellow line

353
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,400
where your butt crack was?

354
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,560
Oh, how lovely! How very lovely.

355
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,440
Do you know the worst one
I ever had with that?

356
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,640
I was filming in the States,
in Texas, town called Lubbock.

357
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,080
And I borrowed a pickup truck
from this quite large gentleman.

358
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,160
Um, who'd lent it.
We needed it for filming.

359
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,880
Drove it around all day, took
it back to him in the evening.

360
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,560
He bent over to
pick something up,

361
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,160
and as he did that, he'd got
his shirt not tucked in.

362
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,280
As he bent over, I could see he'd
done his jeans up under his arse.

363
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,800
What? -Well, 'cause he
wasn't a well off man.

364
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,440
He'd obviously bought a pair
of jeans when he was 14

365
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,280
and didn't fit them any more,
so he just simply...

366
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,560
And I could see he hadn't
wiped his bottom.

367
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,520
Oh, God! Jeremy!

368
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,440
Who steers your eyes?
Why did you look there?

369
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,680
- Because...
- Look away! Look away!

370
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,880
It was a gigantic arse
with a brown...

371
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,720
- I don't want to see a man's claggy bottom.
- I didn't either.

372
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,800
I especially didn't.
I'd spent all day

373
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,760
squirming around in the seats
of his pickup truck.

374
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,840
And I was wearing... I was
wearing beige trousers.

375
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,760
That's all right.

376
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,680
You could explain it to people. It's
not mine. It's somebody else's.

377
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,520
Exactly. I've got somebody else's
skid marks on my trousers.

378
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,040
It doesn't wash.

379
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,000
Now, as we know, a lot of...

380
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,920
particularly sporty cars
these days

381
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,040
have got exhaust systems
that sort of make a racket

382
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,480
when you put your foot down
or when you start them up.

383
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,040
I had an Audi RS3 the other day.

384
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,080
As you fired it up...

385
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,280
- We're only going to the shops for some milk.
- Makes a big fuss.

386
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,240
Makes a huge
song and dance about it.

387
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,320
Actually, some Jags
do this, don't they?

388
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,200
- All the sporty ones do.
- Yeah, they do.

389
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,200
They make a tremendous racket but
you don't hear it inside the Jag.

390
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,320
You can only hear it... Basically, your
neighbours are annoyed by it but not you.

391
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,480
Yes, and this is exactly
what I'm on about.

392
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,200
Because Ford has announced
on the new Mustang,

393
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,160
it's got something called
"Good Neighbour Mode".

394
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,880
Ooh, does it come around and water
your plants when you're on holiday?

395
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,040
Tell you you forgot to
take the cat in? -No.

396
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,440
Bring your post in? -No. It
doesn't do any of those things.

397
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,080
But you can program the car
to start quietly

398
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,880
between certain hours
of the day.

399
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,160
So between, say, 11pm and 8am
it starts quietly.

400
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,160
Ok? Because Ford's
head of noises...

401
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,920
The what?

402
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,600
No, he's American. It'll be the Vice
President of noises, cos they always are.

403
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,480
He's come up with a list of
other annoying sounds.

404
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,640
Oh, where are you on it?
Come on, top, got to be.

405
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,280
Gotta be. Right at the top.
Number one.

406
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,720
That's actually a good point.

407
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,440
What are the most annoying
noises in the world?

408
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,640
Oh, good conversation,
I like that.

409
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,040
- What are they?
- Aircraft.

410
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,600
- What?
- Cat fighting.

411
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,120
- Cat fighting.
- I like that.

412
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,840
Donald Trump.

413
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,360
- Foxes shagging.
- What?

414
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,760
What?

415
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,520
Whoa!

416
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,080
So, who was shagging?

417
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,560
- Foxes shagging.
- Foxes...

418
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,200
No, he's right.
That is annoying.

419
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,240
- Foxes make a lot of noise.
- Do you know why?

420
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,200
This is broadcast in America.

421
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,640
They don't know...
...what shagging is.

422
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,920
We know what shagging is.

423
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,040
- Making love.
- Getting it on.

424
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,520
Making little foxes,
for our American viewers.

425
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,560
I have to be honest. Mine
is an old-fashioned one.

426
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,760
- Polystyrene. Anyone share that one?
- Yeah.

427
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,480
Polystyrene doesn't make
a noise.

428
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,880
It does, it squeaks.

429
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,280
My children bought me
one of those record players,

430
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,720
to digitise vinyl.
You know the one I mean.

431
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,840
To transfer your records
into digital files.

432
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,720
I can't get it out of the box cos
it's covered in polystyrene.

433
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,920
It's just sitting there.

434
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,680
- So your kids bought you this?
- Yes.

435
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,800
And you haven't taken
it out of the box. -No.

436
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,360
You ungrateful bastard.

437
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,960
Did you hear that?
It was like stereo.

438
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,360
I mean, that's your dad.

439
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,960
He wouldn't even
take it out of the box.

440
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,400
Your secret's out of the box now, unlike
your present that they bought you.

441
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,360
That is the end
of Conversation Street.

442
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,880
We must now move on.

443
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,400
In fact, we must move back
to our film.

444
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,120
Tonight we are comparing
the superb

445
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,800
Lamborghini Aventador S,

446
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,040
the Honda NSX - which is a hybrid
and has a wonky fuel gauge...

447
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,720
No, it doesn't. It's not wonky.

448
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,120
...and the Rimac, which is an
all-electric Croatian supercar.

449
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,240
It's our comparison between the
past, the present, and the future.

450
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,080
Yeah, the only trouble with this

451
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
is that we were staying
at a health farm,

452
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,760
which Hammond had chosen,

453
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,840
sticking to a schedule
that he'd dreamt up.

454
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,040
Our first outing was to a museum

455
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,520
in the nearby city of Lucerne.

456
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
But that morning, Jeremy and I

457
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,360
had other things on our minds.

458
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,960
I'm starving already. I think it's
cos I only had air for breakfast.

459
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,360
I had a piece of dry toast.

460
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,840
Stop bleating
and just enjoy the view.

461
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,640
Look around you.

462
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,120
Ah.

463
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,600
Brilliant.

464
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,160
Obviously something's
gone wrong here, hasn't it?

465
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,240
Where's he going?

466
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,080
W...

467
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,720
It's actually shut.

468
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,720
It's roadworks, I think.

469
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,560
We'll have to back up.

470
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,320
So they are prepared to let you sit here
at a red light until you starve to death.

471
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,920
Why don't they just tell you
it's shut? A bit un-Swiss.

472
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,240
Right, there is an escape road to the side.
It's the old route, I think.

473
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,560
If we back up until I can see
it, then we'll go down there.

474
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,800
Once we'd all backed up,

475
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,400
we turned onto
Hammond's back road.

476
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,600
Which was in a gorge.

477
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,560
Yep, this is... Oh, yeah.

478
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,360
Well done, Hammond,
you blithering idiot.

479
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,920
Well, Hammond, I've got to say

480
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,680
I'm glad Honda spent
so much time and effort

481
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,320
working on
the dynamics of this car

482
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,440
so I could enjoy this supercar
extravaganza you've brought me on.

483
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,360
You have excelled yourself
in ruining my day.

484
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,840
Oh, good.

485
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,800
You've brought us
to a builder's yard, Hammond.

486
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,480
There are lavatories on the left

487
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,080
if anybody wishes to use them.

488
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,040
Why? Why did we allow him
to bring us to Switzerland?

489
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,920
Why did we allow him
to put himself in charge?

490
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,760
There we go.

491
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,960
Back on the main road.

492
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,200
Unless, that is, you're me...

493
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,840
in a Lamborghini.

494
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,960
Oh... Argh.

495
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,360
Ugh!

496
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,720
Hammond! Hammond!

497
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,760
Where are you?
I'm going to kill you!

498
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,960
This thing is deeply impressive.

499
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,440
James, I've dialled up my regenerative
braking with the throttle,

500
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,200
so that I lift off
the accelerator,

501
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,800
I don't even have to
touch the brake to stop.

502
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,600
Wow. Can't stand
his resolute chirpiness

503
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,960
in the face of obvious
disaster of his making.

504
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,920
I, meanwhile,
had extricated myself

505
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,840
from Hammond's gorge and was
now causing traffic chaos...

506
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,560
Sorry.

507
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,080
Shit.

508
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,520
...by having to do
a three-point turn.

509
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,920
Sorry.

510
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,520
Sorry. I do apologise.

511
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,640
Having not enjoyed
our supercars all morning,

512
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,760
we soon arrived in Lucerne,

513
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,000
with our irritating
tour guide leading the way.

514
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,400
Hey, chaps,
they're electric trams.

515
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,200
If I had a long enough aerial, could I
connect to the wires and power this?

516
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,120
Why don't you just
reach out and hold onto them?

517
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,480
You would conduct the
electricity, wouldn't you?

518
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,760
Hammond then said that the best
way of getting to the museum

519
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,920
was by driving right through the
medieval heart of the city.

520
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,280
Wasn't there a ring road
we could've used?

521
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,720
Oh, ring roads are boring.
And further.

522
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,640
I'm really getting
the best out of this car here

523
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,680
in this town that Hammond's
bringing us through.

524
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,840
Hammond,
this is a cobbled street.

525
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,400
I'm in a supercar
on a cobbled street.

526
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,640
Well, it's a road.
It's a beautiful road

527
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,880
through this ancient
and wonderful city.

528
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,280
I didn't wanna look at an
ancient and wonderful city.

529
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,040
I'd do that on a bicycle,
you pillock.

530
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,000
Then, things got worse.

531
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,280
Uh, chaps, it's right here.

532
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,960
- You sure?
- Oh, this does look a bit...

533
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,080
Yeah, we'll be all right.

534
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,920
Oh, I don't like this.

535
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,040
"Come to Switzerland and drive
the new NSX," said Hammond.

536
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,240
This Lamborghini's four
inches wider than that Honda

537
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,680
and five inches wider
than the lady shaver.

538
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,800
I am never ever ever going to
get round that corner.

539
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,160
And sure enough...

540
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,000
A tiny bit of left hand and just
creep forward so I can see.

541
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,160
You can't creep.
It's a single clutch gearbox.

542
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,840
Instead of giving this model
40 more horsepower,

543
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,120
I'd have given it
a "one more clutch".

544
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,480
No, I'd agree. Does that fold?

545
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,440
It doesn't matter.
Even if it does,

546
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,640
the back of the car
is wider than the front.

547
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,680
I'm going to have to find
another...

548
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,920
It physically won't fit
through there.

549
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,320
All right, well, we're up there.
See you in a couple of weeks.

550
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,600
So, while James went off to not
enjoy his NSX some more...

551
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,080
Have you got any idea what you're
doing and where you're going?

552
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,680
It's down here, this
pretty little alley here.

553
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,200
...I spent a couple of hours

554
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,000
on the verge of
a massive coronary.

555
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,400
Jesus H.

556
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,600
God, give me strength.

557
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,400
Hammond!

558
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,040
Sorry.

559
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,240
Sorry.

560
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,880
Sorry.

561
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,440
Meanwhile...

562
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,000
Or do you have a bread roll?
I'm starving.

563
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,120
- I need to eat. Eat.
- Ah.

564
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,400
I'm so hungry. Yes.

565
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,080
Danke. Danke, danke, danke.

566
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,880
Oh.

567
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,640
Mm-mm. What are these?

568
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,000
It's bloody Ryvita.

569
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,360
Eventually,
while I was attempting

570
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,920
yet another
impossible manoeuvre,

571
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,120
Hammond and May arrived.

572
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,240
Well...

573
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,320
Oh, no.

574
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,600
That's not good. Sorry.

575
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,520
And then after a short drive
through suburbia,

576
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,800
where none of us got past 40,

577
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,040
we arrived at our destination.

578
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,800
It was a transport museum.

579
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,880
And once Hammond
had plugged his lady shaver

580
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,920
into one of Switzerland's
fast charging points...

581
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,600
...we went inside to look at the
rather underwhelming exhibits.

582
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,640
So let me just see
if I've got this straight.

583
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,920
You made me - well, us -

584
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,000
drive through a gorge
and the 12th century,

585
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,320
so we can look at a Renault 16?

586
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,240
No, no, this is
so much more than that.

587
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,280
There's all the things on the racks
here, and then there's pictures here.

588
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,800
You look for the picture of the
thing that you wanna look at.

589
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,360
Then you touch it.

590
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,360
And now look what happens.

591
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,960
It's presented to you!

592
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,560
I can only apologise for this.

593
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,560
I know you want to see which of
our three cars is the fastest,

594
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,480
which handles the best,
which is the most economical.

595
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,160
Oh, my God,
it's coming towards us.

596
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,440
Yeah.

597
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,560
What we're actually
looking at instead

598
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,920
is a vending machine.

599
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,280
With some old motorcycles on.

600
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,080
Oh, look, come on. -Oh, wow,
it goes round and round.

601
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,000
That is just the best.

602
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
Give me strength.

603
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,360
That night, over dinner,
the mood was even darker.

604
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,280
And the following day,
it didn't improve

605
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,960
because Hammond made us
go on exactly the same route

606
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,480
as he had the day before.

607
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,280
We did this yesterday.

608
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,520
We did this as well yesterday.

609
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,840
And after Hammond
had plugged his car into

610
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,200
the same charging point...

611
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,640
we went off to look at that
day's underwhelming attraction.

612
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,120
The Museum of Chess.

613
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,800
Boom! I win!

614
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,560
He doesn't even know
how to play, does he?

615
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,040
And then the penny dropped.

616
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,560
- Hammond.
- What?

617
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,120
What are we doing tomorrow?

618
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,440
Going to a pencil museum.

619
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,520
Is the pencil museum in
the same town as this museum?

620
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,680
Yes.

621
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,040
Do you keep
bringing us to this town

622
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,800
because it's the only one within
100 miles of our wellness centre

623
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,720
where there is a fast
charging point for your car?

624
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,800
Yes.

625
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,920
So that night,
after another plate of weeds,

626
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,000
James and I sacked Hammond
as team leader

627
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,520
and came up with
our own schedule.

628
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,880
Right, we've found an airfield,

629
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,120
and now we're gonna have
a drag race,

630
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,800
which is a lot more interesting
than going to a museum.

631
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,760
I'd have thought
he'd like museums.

632
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,280
I mean, he's driving one.

633
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,560
Track, check, traction, yes.

634
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,640
I've put it in launch,

635
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,240
which sets the rear two engines
in the first of their two gears.

636
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,360
The front two engines
only have one gear.

637
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,160
I do not know how that works.

638
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,560
Why doesn't the car stretch
or overtake itself?

639
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,120
The simple fact of
the matter is that

640
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,160
because this car has
no electrical gubbins,

641
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,600
it is, despite appearances,
the lightest car here.

642
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,800
And it has 730 horsepower.

643
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,640
So allow me, please,
to demonstrate

644
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,040
that you can't beat
old-time rock and roll.

645
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,400
Thrust mode!

646
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,960
Oh, my word!

647
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,880
God, look at Hammond!

648
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,640
190, 200, 220, 200...

649
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,200
I can't speak fast enough!

650
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,280
James and I were now racing
only to see who'd be last.

651
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,800
Yes, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

652
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,920
Goodbye, Mr May.

653
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,960
Jes-us!

654
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,160
That Rimac just s off.

655
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,880
Ha-ha ha-ha!

656
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,720
If that is the future,
I am so ready!

657
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,600
Oh! Oh-ho!

658
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,640
I've never seen
anything like that.

659
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,440
I've never seen anything move
as quickly as that.

660
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,880
Not with number plates.

661
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,400
Annoyed that my
dinosaur had been humiliated,

662
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,960
I decided to show Hammond

663
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,920
that it still has enough power

664
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,960
to kick-start a dying star.

665
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,200
Yes!

666
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,800
This is what Lamborghinis
are all about.

667
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,320
Oh, yeah.

668
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,000
Which went well.

669
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,880
- Oh, my word!
- Oh!

670
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,440
Sit rep. The entire tyre
has been consumed

671
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,560
- by the heart of the monster.
- It has.

672
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,320
Do you know, the thing was,

673
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,240
the tyre pressure
warning light came on.

674
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,040
- What could that have meant?
- Well, it meant that, on this,

675
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,240
it was specifically telling me there
was a problem with this tyre.

676
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,280
- So I ignored it.
- Yes.

677
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,400
Good job you're not an
airline pilot. -Yes.

678
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,640
However, we'll get it fixed...

679
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,920
...and then... Actually,
we ought to find a track.

680
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,680
And then I'll be able
to thrash you.

681
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,880
- Oh, mate, no.
- No?

682
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,680
You won't find a track in Switzerland,
will you, cos motor racing is banned.

683
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,560
- What do you mean banned?
- Oh, it is.

684
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,320
1955 there was an accident
in France, at Le Mans.

685
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,600
The Swiss banned motorsport.
It's still banned today.

686
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,160
We can think of something else.
Something that requires four tyres.

687
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,320
Oh, God, I tell you what, though, it
does mean another night in his hotel.

688
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,280
You're gonna drive there
on a space saver.

689
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,160
No, I know something we can do.

690
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,320
What?

691
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,920
There's plenty to occupy us
at the hotel.

692
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,640
- Come on.
- Well, not supper.

693
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,360
I may take a while because I'll
be going on a bicycle wheel.

694
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,880
I still can't believe...

695
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,840
I still can't believe
that Switzerland

696
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,800
banned motor racing because of
an accident in another country.

697
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,040
Yeah, it's like Britain
banning railways

698
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,520
because a train crashed
in India.

699
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,640
Yeah, exactly. Or it's like
America invading Iraq

700
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,280
because some Saudi Arabians
destroyed the World Trade Center.

701
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,240
- Whoa.
- Did I say that out loud?

702
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,840
That came out.
That came out as sound.

703
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,920
Well, never mind,
we can edit it out.

704
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,960
Look, um, we'll pick
that film up later on,

705
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,440
but in the meantime you may
remember that in the last series

706
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,680
we had a feature
called Celebrity Brain Crash.

707
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,560
Yes, but we're not
doing that any more

708
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,280
because too many people died.

709
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,800
Yeah, and also because
you all hated it.

710
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,840
Yeah, that's the main reason.

711
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,200
Everybody wrote to us and said,
"That's rubbish. Stop doing it."

712
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,560
Anyway, it doesn't matter,

713
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,680
because we've come up with
another idea,

714
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,560
a brand-new idea
and it is brilliant.

715
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,360
You see, the main reason why
we like having the tent here...

716
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,120
Is that you can walk home
every week.

717
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,680
Yes, it's just that right
down the road,

718
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,720
and I mean less than a mile
away, there is an actual track.

719
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,600
Yes, there is, and we've got a
picture of it here. Have a look.

720
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,080
It's rather fabulous because as you can
see, it's really quite narrow, all of it,

721
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,720
and then bits of it aren't
finished - this stretch.

722
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,440
Yeah, that bit
is entirely gravel.

723
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,360
Yes, it is, but it doesn't
matter because it is a circuit.

724
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,160
And then somebody said to us, "Well,
why don't you get a celebrity

725
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,200
to drive round it every week
to see which is the fastest."

726
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,960
We said no, because that
would be boring. -Yeah.

727
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,960
So we have come up with
an entirely new idea.

728
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,080
You see, everybody's always
wanting to know

729
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,920
who is the fastest
weathergirl in the world,

730
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,280
or who is the world's fastest
transgender architect.

731
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,920
Exactly.

732
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,640
Let me explain
what we're gonna do.

733
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,960
Each week, two celebrities
from the same field

734
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,280
will go head to head, on our
track, in a Jaguar F Type.

735
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,520
OK? It's a feature we're
calling Celebrity Face Off.

736
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,880
Or, for short, Celebrity F
Off... No, that doesn't work.

737
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,520
Tonight we are asking the question
that everybody wants answering.

738
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,440
Who is the fastest
former talent show judge?

739
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,680
And it's an
international competition,

740
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:46,000
between America's Got Talent
and The Voice UK.

741
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,080
Please welcome Ricky Wilson
and David Hasselhoff!

742
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,200
Thank you, man. Welcome.

743
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,920
- Big man's still got it.
- Welcome.

744
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,120
- Thank you.
- Equally, big guy.

745
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,920
- Have a seat.
- Whoo!

746
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,160
Ah.

747
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,320
There you go. All right.

748
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,200
- Hello.
- Hello and welcome.

749
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,080
- Thank you.
- They've made it alive.

750
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,360
No unconvincing deaths.

751
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,320
And, of course, you're not just

752
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,480
former talent show judges.

753
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,600
You both have, obviously,
singing careers.

754
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,800
Albeit with
rather different approaches.

755
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,720
Um...

756
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,920
Let's have a look at
a photograph of the Hoff.

757
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,480
There you go, you see.

758
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,320
That says it all.

759
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,200
The mullet, the dry ice,
the Lamborghini.

760
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,320
- We think that's the American way.
- Mm-hm.

761
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,360
Now let's have a look at
the Yorkshire way.

762
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,320
There he is.

763
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,240
The windswept...

764
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,240
We are making it Yorkshire versus the
United States of America tonight.

765
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,440
- That's what we decided to do.
- York-shire.

766
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,160
Have you been to Yorkshire? -I've...
I've... I've had York-shire pudding.

767
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,200
Actually, we filmed an
episode of Hoff The Record,

768
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,240
which is a series, in Yorkshire,

769
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,760
and we had a blast.

770
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,440
The people were extremely nice.

771
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,040
I couldn't understand
a word they said.

772
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,880
No, it's a special language,
but we're both from Yorkshire.

773
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,600
Yorkshire will be watching. Yorkshire
versus America. Well, we've won that.

774
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,360
Oh, don't pile on the pressure.

775
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,760
Can I just ask, what did you
think of our track?

776
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,400
It's incredible. I mean...

777
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,960
Hopefully, you know,
when you film people...

778
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,040
like I've filmed friends
going round tracks

779
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,640
and they go,
"Oh, film me, film me!"

780
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,080
You don't wanna watch it back cos they
come round the corner like brrrrrrrr.

781
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,720
But we were going sideways
at points on this.

782
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,080
- What about the car? The Jag.
- Loved it.

783
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,160
I loved it, Jaguar.

784
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,240
There's a man
who understands sponsorship.

785
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,720
Yeah, exactly.

786
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,960
I would have thought
your biggest problem

787
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,040
was getting in it,
cos I really struggle.

788
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,800
- I couldn't get in the car, Jeremy.
- Could you not?

789
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,160
No, I had a hard time getting into
KITT, but you know, this was...

790
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,240
Actually,
we've got some footage.

791
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,320
Anyone wanna see footage of the
Hoff trying to get into our Jag?

792
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,040
Yeah! Let's have a
quick look at that.

793
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,920
There it is. Look. Resplendent.

794
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,760
And it's got a roll cage in it.

795
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,440
- And this is the bit...
- Oh, my God.

796
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,360
The bit I like here is -
I've had to do this as well -

797
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,800
is when you have to lift your
own leg.

798
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,440
Argh! Argh!

799
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,640
I found it perfectly my size,
Jaguar Land Rover.

800
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,760
- And even like the colour.
- Yeah, yeah.

801
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,160
Your biggest problem, though,
as I understand it, with cars,

802
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,600
is being run over by them.

803
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,200
Oh, yeah, cos I actually got run over,
then tried to chase after the car.

804
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,880
- You never caught the guy?
- They never caught the guy.

805
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,920
How come they can catch me doing 35
in a 30, but they can't catch...

806
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

807
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,720
It's a very good point.

808
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,640
Um, in fact, when er...

809
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,840
In fact, when the police
questioned me about it,

810
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,160
"So, what was the car like?" and I said
it was a Metro and it had a sunroof.

811
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,440
They said, "How do you know it had a
sunroof?" "Cos I went over the sunroof."

812
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,320
Good observation while
you're being run over.

813
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,000
"And it's a Tudor Webasto
sunroof."

814
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,880
I'm actually surprised, though,

815
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,480
you did survive
your motoring youth, Hoff.

816
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,640
Yeah, my first car was um...

817
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,840
when I was just turning 16,

818
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,880
was a Corvair,
which is a real small car.

819
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,920
Well, not by European standards.

820
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,360
- We call it an enormous car.
- Yeah.

821
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,280
The engine was in the back and it was
described as "unsafe at any speed".

822
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,480
I just realise that now.

823
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,040
Your first car was a Fiat Panda.

824
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,400
- Yeah, if you want an example of a small...
- Oh, my God.

825
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,840
If you want an example of a small car...
a Fiat Panda is what you...

826
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,440
It'd be like you trying to get
into a cupboard under the stairs.

827
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,040
- It was called a what?
- A Panda.

828
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,200
- A Panda?
- Yeah.

829
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,240
They're very rare now,
like Pandas.

830
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,600
Didn't you have people steal
the windscreen? -Yeah.

831
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,280
They have a peculiar thing,
the Panda.

832
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,200
- It has a very flat...
- Completely flat.

833
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,560
Completely flat, and you used to be
able to pop it out, from the outside.

834
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,280
So, many times I'd get into it

835
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,960
and be driving down the road
and go, "Something's wrong."

836
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,080
Like that.

837
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,400
You wouldn't even get that
fast, so you'd never know.

838
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,560
Yeah.

839
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,720
It was only when you turned
the squirters on that it...

840
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,280
- And that happened a lot?
- Well, it happened a few times.

841
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,640
And then I kept buying them
out of this Italian guy

842
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,320
that had a garage
round the corner.

843
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,680
I think he was nicking 'em.

844
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,280
"That's my tax disc."

845
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,120
Now we've gotta get onto KITT.

846
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,480
We all remember Knight Rider
and the Trans Am.

847
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,120
Thing is, I was looking the
other day, cos it's a while...

848
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,960
- When was it actually on?
- It was on from '82 to '86.

849
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,040
OK, '82 to '86. Now, it had,
in your car, you had cru...

850
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,080
These were all
futuristic things.

851
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,720
Cruise control, pollen
filters in the air con,

852
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,920
vocal commands,
automatic opening doors.

853
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,960
You get all that stuff
on a Ford Fiesta now.

854
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,520
It's actually standard
on a Ford Fiesta.

855
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,040
It still really did
capture the imagination.

856
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,480
There was a Yorkshireman
who did an homage to KITT.

857
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,640
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

858
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,520
- Got a picture of it here.
- It wasn't me.

859
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,280
No, look.

860
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,880
A, it's a Renault. -It's not that bad.
It's not bad.

861
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,000
- Formula One drivers have a...
- Exactly.

862
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,000
- A stick like that.
- I see nothing wrong with that.

863
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,240
But no, because...

864
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,120
You've come up with your rules
of the road, which I quite like.

865
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,600
You've got one here.
Old people over a certain age

866
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,920
should be legally required to
place a hat on the parcel shelf.

867
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,760
Now, old people... Not so
much old people in general.

868
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,200
I was gonna say be careful,
because if you say 65...

869
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,520
- Yeah, that's me.
- No, I'm just saying...

870
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,400
On certain journeys, I'd like to
put a hat on the parcel shelf,

871
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,720
just to indicate
that I'm not racing you.

872
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,000
What I really like
is this business of um...

873
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,040
male and female cyclists should
indicate on their Lycra bottoms

874
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:55,240
- what sex they are.
- Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

875
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,320
Well, I know...

876
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,520
I know where you're going
with that.

877
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,480
We've all been... "Ooh, I say!
Oh, no, he's got a beard."

878
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,480
Now, I wanna get
on to your laps.

879
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,960
Oh. -And I wanna
start off, if I may,

880
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,840
- with you, your Hoffmeister.
- Oi.

881
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,680
Are you a fast driver?

882
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:22,120
You know, I um...
I'm basically an actor.

883
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,280
You know, I'm not
really a good driver

884
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,120
but I just look good doing it.

885
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,280
Because we have some
footage of you attempting...

886
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:36,400
I think it was your first one and making a bit
of a mess-up of what is the last corner...

887
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,720
Right. -And then really making
a mess-up of the finish.

888
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,800
Let's have a look at this.

889
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,240
Here he comes now, into the
last corner, goes in deep,

890
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,560
which is crazy,
loses it on the grass

891
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,040
and then there's
the finish line - and stops.

892
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:57,280
- We've never seen that before.
- No...

893
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,720
They told me
the first lap didn't count.

894
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,880
Yes. -And that's why I
didn't hit the finish line.

895
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,880
- We can edit out that excuse.
- Ah, come on!

896
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,160
I love the idea of a Formula
One driver going...

897
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,280
Well, that's it, and that's
as far as I'm going.

898
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,200
- Am I? Yes.
- Anyway.

899
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,680
Let's have a look at
the Hoff's lap.

900
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,320
And we are off on our brand-new
track in our brand-new car.

901
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,640
Remember,
Knight Rider drove himself.

902
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,720
Clipping the corner but keeping two
wheels on the track, nice to see.

903
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,120
And then you go left
and onto the gravel.

904
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,200
This is what we call
the difficult bit.

905
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,640
It is actually quite tricky

906
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,120
as you flick it right there
and then flick it left.

907
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,600
Now we're into - not the
Carousel - the Gravelsel.

908
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,600
It's like a banked
gravel corner.

909
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,720
Never been seen anywhere before.

910
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,520
Into the difficult bit two.

911
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,440
You're managing to keep it mostly
tidy, which is quite good.

912
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,080
I'm looking forward to seeing Judi
Dench go down here one day - sideways.

913
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,360
Ooh, deep again!

914
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,120
Nearly stopped, but now
picking up the speed.

915
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,960
And onto the main straight.

916
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,120
This is one helluva track, this.

917
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,960
Hit it! Yeah!

918
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,040
That was the sound
of a man crapping himself.

919
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,800
And I don't think you did
actually lift, which is brave.

920
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,280
Now braking.

921
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,440
Are we gonna get
the last corner right?

922
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,640
Yes. All neatly done
and there we are.

923
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,120
Ladies and gentlemen,
across the line!

924
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,320
Well...

925
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,520
That looked like
you were in control.

926
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,160
- No, I... No.
- No, that was tidy.

927
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,440
The slower you look, very often
the faster you're going.

928
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,440
- Yeah.
- I mean, that is a true fact.

929
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,520
Yeah, if you go smooth and keep the
car on balance, but it's hard to do.

930
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,960
It is. I went out and had
a play on that this morning,

931
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,360
and just had... the tail out
the entire way round.

932
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,960
It's taken me 15 minutes to get round here
but I had fun in the process. Anyway.

933
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,600
- Can I use that as my excuse?
- No.

934
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,880
We're gonna see your lap now.
OK, are we ready?

935
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,480
Let's bring it up. Here
he is, Ricky Wilson's lap.

936
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,120
Little bit further back
than you were.

937
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,440
Nice excuse
and we haven't even started.

938
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,880
Not even looking. No hands.
No hands. No hands.

939
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:28,520
- Ooh, it's deep, deep, deep.
- Getting it all together.

940
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,920
But it's not bad
slowing down there

941
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,960
cos you can
now keep the power on there,

942
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
keep the power on here,
and onto the difficult bit.

943
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,880
No, that's good. Gonna flick
the tail out a bit?

944
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,200
Yeah, that's nice.
Flick it the other way.

945
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,320
I found that made you go
quicker, flicking the tail out.

946
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:48,000
Whoo-hoo! Take that!

947
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,600
This is good, round the
Gravelsel. Get that tail out.

948
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,720
There it is.
We're gonna find out later

949
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,560
whether that's faster or slower
than the Hoff's approach.

950
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,880
Cutting the corner. That's not going
to be grass for very much longer.

951
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,080
That's very good.
Very good indeed.

952
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,800
Also, when you come back
to the Tarmac here,

953
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,600
it's very, very slippery,
that bit.

954
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,920
For reasons I don't understand.

955
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,840
Kicking dust off the tail.
Looks good, that car.

956
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,680
And now, onto the straight.

957
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,400
Give it some. Come on, Jag.

958
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,320
- Did you lift here?
- Yes.

959
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,640
- I don't think you did.
- Ah, well, maybe not.

960
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,000
I don't think you did there. -I was
having too much of a good time.

961
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,480
Ooh, kick the tail out at the last corner
and there we are, across the line.

962
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,480
It looked all right.
It looked all right.

963
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:38,120
- I'm a little nervous now.
- It looked all right.

964
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,240
- Are you proud?
- Yeah, I am quite proud.

965
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,880
- Proud of that.
- Yeah.

966
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,360
Oh.

967
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,760
Have I remembered to bring
the times out with me?

968
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,680
- Oh, gosh.
- Yes, I have.

969
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,440
I think it's you.

970
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,840
I think it's you, cos you
looked more in control.

971
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,440
I was all over the shop.

972
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,440
Yeah, but no... you were smooth.

973
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,240
And I stopped
at the first corner.

974
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,160
You did virtually stop, that is true.
You did actually come to a halt.

975
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,160
Mind you, you stopped
just before the finish line.

976
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,440
Yeah, yeah.

977
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,200
David Hasselhoff, you did it...

978
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,240
representing the United
States of America.

979
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,440
Oh, God.

980
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,080
One minute...

981
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,760
24, point one.

982
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,320
We have no idea
whether that's fastest.

983
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,240
- Yeah. It could be anything.
- Literally no idea.

984
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,360
That could be the fastest time

985
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,800
we're ever, ever
going to see round here.

986
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,120
- Right.
- Or it could be the slowest.

987
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,040
We have no idea.

988
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,280
- Ricky Wilson.
- Yeah, yeah.

989
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,560
One minute...

990
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,280
- ...20...
- Ooh.

991
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,760
...point one.

992
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,880
Whoo!

993
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,440
Whoo!

994
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,080
Ohh!

995
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,600
- I... Oh.
- Well, there we are.

996
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,360
Well.

997
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,040
So, there we are.
How do you feel about that?

998
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,320
I've spent years practising.

999
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,240
I told you I was an actor.

1000
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,000
David Hasselhoff...
and, as it turns out,

1001
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,920
the fastest former talent judge
in the world, Ricky Wilson!

1002
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,520
Thank you, gentlemen.

1003
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,320
Right, let's get back
to Switzerland.

1004
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,800
When we left the action,
Jeremy had torn the tyre

1005
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,920
clean off his Lamborghini,

1006
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,000
and we thought that would be it,
as far as accidents are concerned.

1007
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,240
Mm-hm, we figured that
because we are all

1008
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,200
experienced,
professional drivers,

1009
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,000
nothing else
could possibly go wrong.

1010
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,680
Exactly.

1011
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,080
So we pick up the story
at our wellness clinic,

1012
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,600
where we were trying to work out

1013
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,800
how to get the best
out of three supercars

1014
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,920
in a country where
motor racing is banned.

1015
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,920
This was not easy,

1016
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,640
given the activity that Hammond
had planned for us that night.

1017
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,400
Arghh! Jesus!

1018
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,880
Well, we could
always go to a museum.

1019
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,160
We need to go to
a race track, Hammond.

1020
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,880
Well, look, actually, as we're
in Switzerland... Clarkson?

1021
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,280
- What?
- Can you do... Argh!

1022
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,640
Can you do hill climbs in
Switzerland under their laws?

1023
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,440
I don't know.
I've got a tube up my arse.

1024
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,720
Well, seriously,
you've been here before.

1025
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,840
You're supposedly the motorsport
expert, you always say.

1026
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,880
I don't know.
I've got a tube up my arse.

1027
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,200
Yeah, but the thing
that they banned was...

1028
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,800
because in the famous
Le Mans crash,

1029
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,720
cars crashed into each other.

1030
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,920
That can't happen in a hill climb, so
would they allow stuff against the clock?

1031
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,680
I don't know because I've
got a tube up my arse.

1032
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,600
Come on, think, Clarkson.

1033
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,840
I think you can do
hill climbing in Switzerland,

1034
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,160
but I don't know for sure because
I've got a tube up my arse.

1035
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,560
Right. OK, that's a start.

1036
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,480
Let's see if
we can find out... Argh!

1037
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,440
After a bit of digging around,

1038
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,840
James discovered there was a Swiss
hill climb event on that weekend...

1039
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,200
and it was only 200 miles
from our hotel.

1040
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,160
Which was fine...
for some of us.

1041
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,000
At this speed, six of my 12
cylinders are shut down.

1042
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,080
They're not using
any fuel at all,

1043
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,640
so I could probably do
400 miles on the fuel I have.

1044
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,520
Just check on James.

1045
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,440
Er, James, are you able to make the
hill climb event 200 miles away?

1046
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,400
Well, let me just have a
look. Er, yes, I am.

1047
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,560
Well, how do you
know with that fuel gauge?

1048
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,120
Bec... Oh, I can't be bothered.

1049
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,720
It's not straight, is it?
Admit it.

1050
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:56,520
Happy piling the motorway miles on
your precious cars, are we? Good.

1051
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:59,560
Why is there somebody talking
to us from a van, James?

1052
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,280
It's a lorry!

1053
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,240
Hey, Hammond, I don't know
where you are, but there's

1054
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,400
a really remarkable-looking futuristic
car on the back of a truck.

1055
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,600
Must just be a mock-up, I suppose,
otherwise it would be being driven.

1056
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,800
Yeah, you pile
the miles on. Enjoy yourself!

1057
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,640
I don't see
what's wrong with this.

1058
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,400
People don't ride their race horses
to the Grand National, do they?

1059
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,480
They put them on a lorry.
Every weekend,

1060
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,200
people all over the world, load
their best toys onto a truck,

1061
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,160
take them somewhere
and enjoy them.

1062
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,840
Horses, supercars, race cars,

1063
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,240
rally cars,
race bikes, dirt bikes.

1064
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,760
All of them. It's what you do.

1065
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,840
Prepare to deploy smug face
at Richard Hammond.

1066
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,640
After leaving
the van driver far behind,

1067
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,880
James and I arrived at
what's almost certainly

1068
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,640
the most beautiful hill climb
event in the world.

1069
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,560
And the cars weren't bad either.

1070
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,240
We were keen to get cracking,

1071
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,760
but, first, we had some important
business to attend to.

1072
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,520
Oh, brown food.

1073
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,840
Brown drink.

1074
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,720
- Calories.
- Mm-mm.

1075
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,840
Oh. Oh.

1076
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,200
Oh. Mm.

1077
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,080
I'm actually shaking,
I'm so excited.

1078
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,160
Mm. Mm.

1079
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,600
- What?
- Look who's here.

1080
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,760
Oh, yeah, it's the van driver.

1081
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,800
Ah.

1082
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,280
He won't have the energy
to drive up the hill.

1083
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:48,120
What? -He won't have the
energy to drive up the hill.

1084
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,400
Here I am, car rested,
ready and fully charged.

1085
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,440
Breakfast. Actual food.

1086
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,880
Brown food.

1087
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,720
Yeah. Well, professional racers do
carb load, don't they, before races.

1088
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,000
- So, you're sort of... -Like all athletes carb load.
- They don't lettuce load.

1089
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,080
As I walked over, I saw you
two and thought, "Athletes."

1090
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,640
Shut up, Hammond.

1091
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:12,400
With breakfast demolished, it
was time to go hill climbing.

1092
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,480
But before we did
our timed runs,

1093
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,960
we had to learn the course.

1094
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,200
Corsa. Track mode.

1095
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,240
Traction control... off.

1096
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,560
No, traction control on.

1097
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,680
Practising, Jeremy, practising.

1098
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,000
Don't showboat.
Must beat Hammond.

1099
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,400
It's a 1.09 mile course.

1100
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,640
It has 11 corners.

1101
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,440
And the most important factor
in all of this

1102
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,120
is my ability to concentrate
and remember how it goes.

1103
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,560
Everything good.

1104
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,520
Creep mode off, suspension low.

1105
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,560
Race mode. We're good.

1106
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:07,080
Ok, that's a good start.

1107
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:11,240
It's a bit wobbly going up
here, but... Oh, lordy lord!

1108
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,520
Jesus Christ,
it's tight and narrow.

1109
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:21,560
No idea what I'm doing.

1110
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,600
No, that's not as tight as I thought.
That was a mistake.

1111
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,680
Unleash 1200 horsepower,
bit of brakes.

1112
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,400
It's no problem.

1113
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,880
No looking at the drops.
Drops are irrelevant.

1114
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,680
Balancing it
through there nicely.

1115
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,720
This is starting
to come together now.

1116
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,760
This is the long
right-hander, I think.

1117
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,880
No, this is
the long right-hander.

1118
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,200
It's bloody complicated.

1119
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,080
Getting on it, getting on it,
getting on it.

1120
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,960
This could go so wrong.

1121
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,960
With the practice
session complete,

1122
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,360
it was time to go
against the clock.

1123
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,680
And for me, this was a problem.

1124
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,080
Because the rules said
that in timed runs,

1125
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,200
I had to wear a helmet.

1126
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,800
No.

1127
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,200
No.

1128
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,440
Right, well, I can
either drive like this,

1129
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,920
with a helmet on, or...

1130
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,440
What the hell are we gonna do?

1131
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,640
It was time
to break out my genius.

1132
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,240
Lamborghini's got one of
their test drivers here.

1133
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,960
He's about this big.

1134
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,160
- What's your name?
- Giacomo.

1135
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,880
- Giacomo.
- Giacomo is the Italian name.

1136
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,120
- Yiacomo.
- Giacomo.

1137
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,760
- Jack-mo.
- Giacomo.

1138
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,240
Whatever. Don't worry.
You look exactly like me.

1139
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,520
I'll tilt that camera down,
it'll make you look taller.

1140
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,520
Be fine with a crash helmet
on. Curly hair, same as me.

1141
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:02,160
- But you've gotta sound like me.
- All right.

1142
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,240
So... "Hammond, you idiot!"
Say that.

1143
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,240
- Hammond, you idiot!
- Hammond, you idiot.

1144
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,720
- You idiot.
- You idiot.

1145
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,280
Exactly, because he
always is an idiot.

1146
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,680
So you can always drop that in.
It's a useful phrase.

1147
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:17,200
The other one is, this is the
fastest car, pause... in the world.

1148
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:21,360
This is fastest car... pause...
in the world. -Say it.

1149
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,040
This is the fastest car...
pause, in the world.

1150
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,240
With all that sorted out,

1151
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,480
James took his place
on the start line.

1152
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,200
This is the big one.

1153
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,520
...James May!

1154
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:53,480
Now is the tight right-hander,
so a dab of brakes.

1155
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,280
I'm sorry I didn't say anything.
That was my concentrating face.

1156
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,760
That's the most I've
concentrated for five years.

1157
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,560
Then it was my turn.

1158
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,640
...Jeremy Clarkson!

1159
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,080
Hammond, you hidiot.

1160
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:42,760
This is the fastest car...
pause... in the world.

1161
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,600
With an astonishing
time on the scoresheet,

1162
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,400
Hammond had it all to do.

1163
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,840
And we decided to give him
some encouragement.

1164
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,680
- Hammond.
- Yeah.

1165
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,800
Really, really, really big crowds
here today, as you can see.

1166
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,280
- Yeah.
- Because they know...

1167
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,360
you're gonna break
the record here.

1168
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,160
54 seconds.

1169
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,320
Come on, you've got 1200 horsepower,
you've been practising all morning.

1170
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,720
Actually, it is the most powerful
car here by some margin.

1171
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,680
Well, I can't promise to...

1172
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,720
Well, it's the fastest car
we've ever seen!

1173
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,560
Look at it this way,
the whole of Croatia

1174
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:30,480
is watching this knowing that
you're gonna do it for them.

1175
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:33,000
In 52 seconds' time,
you're going to be

1176
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,520
whatever the equivalent of a hero of the
Soviet Union is, but in modern-day Croatia.

1177
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:39,200
- Not just Croatia.
- It goes spreading out.

1178
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,160
It's the whole
Eastern European region.

1179
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,400
Yeah.

1180
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:45,000
You have got a lot riding on
your shoulders, Richard Hammond.

1181
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,320
- You...
- A lot.

1182
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,280
- You will be on a coin.
- Thank you, guys.

1183
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,520
- He'll be on a coin.
- Or a stamp.

1184
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,520
Oh, I'm quite nervous.
I'm suddenly nervous.

1185
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:05,600
...Ricardo Hammondo!

1186
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,880
OK, here we go.
Give it your best shot, Rich.

1187
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,600
Yeah. Watch this.

1188
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,840
Crash!

1189
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,680
Right, I have the times here.
Are you ready?

1190
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,160
Representing the present day...

1191
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,840
...the Honda NSX did it in...

1192
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,280
1:20.4.

1193
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,960
OK.

1194
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,720
Representing the past,
the Lamborghini Aventador

1195
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,960
did it in 1 minute 10.4.

1196
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,640
Ooh!

1197
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:19,680
And this is the big one.
Representing the future...

1198
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,960
...the Rimac did it in

1199
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,560
one minute... 14.7.

1200
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,480
Yes! I am the winner!

1201
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,240
- Oh, I am victorious.
- No, wait! Wait a minute.

1202
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,080
Wait a minute.

1203
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:39,200
The past and me. -You weren't
even driving the bloody car.

1204
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,520
Well, you were driving
your car and you crashed it.

1205
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:45,760
Yes, but I crashed after the
finishing line, like a professional.

1206
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,960
Hammond, when was the last time

1207
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
you went home after work
not in an air ambulance?

1208
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,400
Now...

1209
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,960
When was the last time you took
your own clothes off at night,

1210
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,120
rather than have a paramedic
cut them off in a field?

1211
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,840
Now, hang on a minute. -You
crashed after the finishing line,

1212
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,040
so our cameras weren't there.

1213
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,000
We had to get that clip
from YouTube.

1214
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:08,800
That is not professional. That
is selfish. It is. -Look...

1215
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,560
I just don't know
how it happened.

1216
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,840
We do. We know
exactly how it happened.

1217
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,960
History has taught us you can't
drive in a straight line.

1218
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,360
And now we've seen you can't
drive round a corner either.

1219
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,480
Do you know what's a really
remarkable thing about that crash?

1220
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,120
What? -That car
continued to catch fire

1221
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,640
five days after it happened.

1222
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:30,400
Fi... What? Bursting into... -Yeah.
Spontaneously bursting into flames.

1223
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:34,440
The reason is the accident damaged one
of the cells in the lithium ion battery.

1224
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,600
That caused a short circuit,
it catches fire,

1225
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,120
but then that damages
the next cell,

1226
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,280
so that one catches fire,
and so it goes on.

1227
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,240
There are 8,000 cells
in that thing.

1228
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,280
It's like a chain reaction.
What do they call it?

1229
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,320
Yeah, chain reaction.
It's called thermal runaways.

1230
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,160
Bang, bang, bang, bang,
and so it goes on.

1231
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,160
I was all right.

1232
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,600
Thank you.

1233
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:02,600
It's relevant. I'm OK.

1234
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,160
We don't care, and anyway it's
time to end the programme

1235
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:09,440
with a conclusion to our very
thorough test, and it's this.

1236
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,240
The future is very fast...

1237
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:15,680
and extremely quiet...
but a bit burney.

1238
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,160
And on that terrible
disappointment, it's time to end.

1239
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,240
Thank you so much
for watching. Goodbye.
