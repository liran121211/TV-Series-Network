1
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,600
Hello, everyone!

2
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,040
Hello!

3
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,120
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

4
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,720
Thanks, everyone.

5
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,360
Hello.

6
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,440
Thank you.

7
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much, everyone.

8
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,120
Thank you and welcome.
Welcome!

9
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,800
And in this show,
we have literally everything

10
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,880
the motoring enthusiast
could possibly want.

11
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,720
A shopping centre...

12
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,040
an explosion...

13
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,240
and a man banging a pole.

14
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,200
Exciting stuff, isn't it?

15
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,640
That... That is all to come -
but we start with this.

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,720
If you're wealthy and you have
nothing to do all day long,

17
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,240
you're going to develop
a drink problem.

18
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,600
It's inevitable
and it always happens.

19
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,000
Paul Gascoigne, Queen Mother...

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,360
James May.

21
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,640
But if you're from
the United Arab Emirates,

22
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,440
you can't do that.

23
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,080
So instead, they buy toys
that run on the stuff

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,040
that made them rich
in the first place.

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,320
What, gold?

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,520
No, James. Not gold.
Go and have another gin.

27
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,480
That's why this week,

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,920
I've taken The Grand Tour
to Dubai.

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,640
So let's start out here.

30
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,000
And let's start with this.

31
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,560
Ah-ha-ha!

32
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,560
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

33
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,600
This is what's called
a Sandrail.

34
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,320
A vehicle built specifically
to play in places like this.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,040
Whoo! Ha-ha!

36
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,480
Admittedly, they were
invented in the USA.

37
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,400
But here in the UAE,

38
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,440
things are a bit more hardcore.

39
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,520
In America, they turn these
out with 300, 400 horsepower.

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,760
Over here,
they've dialled that up.

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,440
To 1500.

42
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,120
Ho-ho!

43
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,360
And they run them on
these incredibly aggressive

44
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,720
paddle-style tyres.

45
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,640
Which means
it can accelerate from 0-60

46
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,760
in under three seconds.

47
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,920
That's supercar speeds -
on sand!

48
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,360
Holy mo... It's...

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,120
Roughing hell!

50
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,680
I'm doing wheelies!

51
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,880
Jesus! Ohh-ho!

52
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,440
That's insane!

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,160
I'm in love!

54
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,760
Keen to see what else
the locals are driving,

55
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,840
I headed back into town.

56
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,080
This is called the Ripsaw

57
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,880
and it's built
by a small American firm

58
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,360
who specialise in extreme
off-road vehicles.

59
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,720
Their customers
are mainly the military

60
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,600
and the people who make
the Fast & Furious films.

61
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,880
However,
if you have the money -

62
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,680
uh... look where we are -

63
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,400
you can have a Ripsaw
built just for you,

64
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,560
as your own private run-about.

65
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,520
So, let's see what it's like.

66
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,800
Oh, and straight away we are
in thumbs-up territory.

67
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,680
Gull-wing doors.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,560
Safety.

69
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,160
It's a tank. I'm in a tank.
It's matte black.

70
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,920
Ha-ha-ha!

71
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,120
I'm on the road!

72
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,520
Because each Ripsaw
is custom-made,

73
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,120
there is no definitive
price list.

74
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,520
But I can tell you,

75
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,920
this one cost its owner
around £300,000.

76
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,320
For that, you get what's billed
as a high-end luxury supertank.

77
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,680
And if you're nine, which I am,

78
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,560
it doesn't get much better
than that.

79
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,040
On the luxury front,
I've got air-con,

80
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,720
electrically adjusted
leather seats, stereo.

81
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,040
I mean, it's hardly
a Bentley Bentayga in here

82
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,560
but look at all the controls
and switches.

83
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,520
I've got winches, work lights,

84
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,600
a light bar.

85
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,920
And who doesn't want

86
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,280
a Thunderbirds-style
steering wheel?

87
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,360
Ooh. Roundabout.

88
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,560
Yeah.

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,280
Ooh. Yeah, I'll be honest,

90
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,520
visibility is a bit poor
out the sides.

91
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,000
It should
get marked down for that.

92
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,160
And it turns out

93
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,920
visibility isn't the Ripsaw's
only drawback as a city car.

94
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,440
So here I am at the shops,
looking for a parking space.

95
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,280
As you do.

96
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,520
And... Well,
you can see for yourself.

97
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,440
They haven't thought somebody
might turn up in one of these.

98
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,560
Thankfully, because the Ripsaw
weighs nearly four tonnes,

99
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,560
and is a tank,

100
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,040
it can get round this issue.

101
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,000
There we go.

102
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,320
I think at the next
management meeting,

103
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,320
they'll be having a serious rethink about
the width of their parking spaces.

104
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Morning, shoppers.

105
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,400
To be fair, this is
a very big shopping centre.

106
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,760
This is easier than walking.
It's miles.

107
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,000
Ooh, that reminds me.
I need to get cat food.

108
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,480
Unfortunately,
I couldn't find the pet shop

109
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,560
so it was time to leave.

110
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,240
I'm going to go out the way I came in.
I don't want to make too much mess.

111
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,080
And right now,
you'll be thinking:

112
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,040
how's he going to do a
three-point-turn in that thing?

113
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,280
Ah, this is actually better
than that.

114
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,760
For in-town manoeuvrability,
this is a tremendous feature.

115
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,640
I'm surprised more
manufacturers don't fit it.

116
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,640
Although the Ripsaw is,
in its own unique way,

117
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,280
a good town run-about,

118
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,080
it's definitely
at its happiest...

119
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,160
...out here.

120
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,800
With a huge 6.6 litre
diesel V8,

121
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,120
the standard Ripsaw is acknowledged as
the fastest tracked vehicle ever built.

122
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,560
But this particular Ripsaw
is not the standard model.

123
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,560
In a normal state of tune
it's 400 brake horsepower.

124
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,520
This one's been taken up to 700.

125
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,560
And 975 pounds feet of torque.

126
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,120
Nearly four tonnes
of off-road tank

127
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,280
travelling at 60mph
perfectly happily.

128
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,480
It is mighty.

129
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,120
An equally surprising
sensation is the ride.

130
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,000
I thought, because it's tracked, it'll
just be solid and incredibly brutal.

131
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,920
But it has suspension.

132
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,520
More suspension travel
than a Range Rover,

133
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,640
so it's supple.

134
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,240
Suddenly,
it's more gazelle than rhino.

135
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,720
This thing rocks.

136
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,840
And when it comes
to bashing the dunes,

137
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,400
the Ripsaw
is in a league of its own.

138
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,760
A Land Rover Discovery can
climb a gradient of about 45%.

139
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,480
This thing, 75.

140
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,760
That's damn near vertical.

141
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,600
Boom! Ha-ha!

142
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,640
This is the moment
when, in desert driving:

143
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,360
"Oh, no! What's beyond?
What's beyond?"

144
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,800
But I'm not worried,
cos I'll be fine.

145
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,040
Ha-ha.

146
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,320
Yeah!

147
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,320
I've driven in deserts a lot,

148
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,920
never in something
that just feels this capable.

149
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,800
I mean, camels are good
in the desert, yeah.

150
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,240
But this is better.

151
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,360
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

152
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,120
What a device.

153
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,000
I love this thing.

154
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,240
I want one, I want one. Yep!

155
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,440
- I really, really want one.
- I do.

156
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,160
Very nice.

157
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,360
Not bothered about that 1400
horsepower thing, but "that".

158
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,560
Yeah.

159
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,680
I must ask, though, can you drive a
tracked vehicle on the road in the UK?

160
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,160
- Well, the Army can.
- Apart from the Army.

161
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,160
You're not allowed to drive a tracked
vehicle that's going to damage the road,

162
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,880
but the Ripsaw's OK because
the tracks are rubber.

163
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,400
And of course, because they're rubber,
if you're a complete nincompoop

164
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,320
and you crash into
somebody's treasured BMW,

165
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,600
it does less damage...
Did you see that?

166
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,240
Did you know
you had even done that?

167
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,560
No.

168
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,520
It's a tank.
Which is why I love it.

169
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,560
And now it is time for us to pop
into the post office of chat

170
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,680
on Conversation Street.

171
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,160
Now...

172
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,720
...as this is the start
of a new year,

173
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,080
we thought we'd have a look
at some of the cars we...

174
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,120
we're looking forward
to coming along in 2018.

175
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,520
It's actually quite a car-ry
Conversation Street.

176
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,600
And I want to start with
the Bentley Continental GT,

177
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,640
cos that's been around
for what, 15 years now?

178
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,400
- Yeah, it is.
- 15 years.

179
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,840
Anyway, they've restyled it,
given it an all-new look.

180
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,560
Here it is.

181
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,080
Wow, that is radical, isn't it?

182
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,280
Yes,
all they've changed... What?

183
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,440
Well, it's a good question.

184
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,600
Anyway, on the inside, they say it
has "driver-orientated instruments".

185
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,280
As opposed to what?

186
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,960
Yeah, no idea.

187
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,640
They say the central command
screen is "retina quality".

188
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,040
I hope it's not
my retina quality.

189
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,440
It'll be sort of slightly blurry and
a bit bloodshot round the edges.

190
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,120
Actually,
if you defocus my camera

191
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,080
you can see
what it would look like.

192
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,360
Like that.

193
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,720
Actually, that's better.

194
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,360
Yeah, to be honest,
I wish I had your retina,

195
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
- sitting here looking at you - it's better.
- I do.

196
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,160
So anyway, in short, this car
looks the same as it did before.

197
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,160
It has a speedometer you can see

198
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,320
and a satnav screen
that's in focus,

199
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,280
all for £150,000.

200
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,960
No, but actually, to be fair, for
a W12 twin-turbo car like that,

201
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,680
150 grand these days isn't bad.

202
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,280
And... And I bet that's
a bloody good car.

203
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,520
- I think it probably will be.
- I bet you it is.

204
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,280
I bet that's going to be
bloody good as well.

205
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,440
The only thing I don't like
about Bentley,

206
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,320
I wish they'd stop going on about
all that Bentley boys at Mulsanne,

207
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,680
and men in aprons making things.

208
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,120
I've got a bit from their...
from their blurb here.

209
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,720
With your blurry eyes,
here he goes.

210
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,320
Retina quality reading
coming up.

211
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,560
It's really not working, is it?

212
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,480
Oh, so depressing!

213
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,960
It says, "Designed, engineered
and handcrafted in Britain".

214
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,440
But the truth is, that's a
Porsche Panamera underneath

215
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,960
and it has a VW engine,

216
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,840
and a Porsche gearbox, in fact.

217
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,560
No, that's true but the chief
executive of Bentley is called

218
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,200
- Bunter Potherington-Smythe.
- Is he?

219
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,600
No, he's called
Wolfgang Durheimer.

220
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,600
- Is he?
- Yeah. A bit of a giveaway.

221
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,800
But that's exactly the sort of
thing they should celebrate.

222
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,680
They should say, "Bentley. Don't
worry, it's reassuringly German".

223
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,800
Precisely. That's what
you want to hear, actually.

224
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,720
- There's a chance it might work.
- Anyway, have you seen this?

225
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,840
This is the AMG Project One
developed by Lewis Hamilton,

226
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,040
so presumably it will have
pierced door mirrors.

227
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,600
Yeah.

228
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
- And tattooed bodywork.
- Yeah.

229
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,720
And when it gets to where
it's going, the satnav says,

230
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,080
"Hashtag blessed".

231
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,600
Going to cost
two million pounds.

232
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,640
Doesn't say whether
that includes tax.

233
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,520
Cheeky, that is.

234
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,800
- Cruel but fair.
- Ha-ha-ha!

235
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,080
A car I'm looking forward
to driving this year is this.

236
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,440
That is the new BMW 8 Series.

237
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,400
And if it actually
looks like that,

238
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,320
that admittedly is the styling
thing that they show the public.

239
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,720
But if it looks like that,
I think it will be fantastic.

240
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,480
And I've heard that it will be
available with a 6.6-litre V12.

241
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,560
- That's a waste of time.
- What?

242
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,440
Well, V12s actually don't make
much sense, if you think about it.

243
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,520
Well, that's a bit of a
sweeping statement, isn't it?

244
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,480
No, seriously, cos you get
all the complexity

245
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,560
and all the thirst
and where's the upside?

246
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,840
Well, for a given capacity you get a
greater number of smaller pistons

247
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,680
which have a
lower reciprocating rate,

248
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,360
which means you can have a
higher rev line on the engine,

249
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,880
and that gets you more power.

250
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,200
Has a point.

251
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,520
Yeah, the thing is,
though, the power,

252
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,800
the extra power you talk about,

253
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,880
as a result of whatever
it was you just said,

254
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,200
is offset by the weight.

255
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,920
And they sound dreary,

256
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,400
and all V12s depreciate like
pianos falling off tower blocks.

257
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,920
No, they do.
Friend of mine, OK?

258
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,400
He had a Ferrari GTC4Lusso,
the V12 one.

259
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,600
Kept it four months and sold it,

260
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,960
after four months -

261
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,320
and lost £55,000.

262
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,720
- Ouch.
- In four months.

263
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,600
Four... Yes! I mean,
if he'd have had the V8,

264
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,920
it wouldn't have
depreciated that much.

265
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,640
Well, mainly because he wouldn't have
wanted to sell it in the first place.

266
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,000
That is really good buyers' advice
for everyman! We all now know...

267
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,680
This from a man who's just
reviewed a £300,000 tank!

268
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,480
- Has anyone got an expensive car?
- Yes.

269
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,080
- What?
- Range Rover.

270
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,680
That's not expensive.

271
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,520
A Range Rover.
We use those as vans.

272
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,520
What's the most... A what?

273
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,680
SVR.

274
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,000
Oh, an SVR is quite expensive.

275
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,280
- Is that with the V8 in it?
- Yes.

276
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,680
- Do you not feel an idiot when you overtake?
- No, Hammond, it's got a 1.3!

277
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,600
With that supercharged V8 you feel
like such an idiot when you overtake

278
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,720
cos of the noise it makes.
It's genuinely embarrassing.

279
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,440
I'll admit... OK, let's not talk
about supercars anymore.

280
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,960
Try and think of something
that isn't about Lamborghinis.

281
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,480
Well...

282
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,360
It is, as well!

283
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,800
The car I most
like the look of is this:

284
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,720
it's the Lamborghini concept
for...

285
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,400
Actually made me do it.

286
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,560
It's called the Terzo Millennio.

287
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,520
I don't know if that's how you
pronounce that: Terzo Millennio.

288
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,840
But thing about that car,
interesting,

289
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,920
it has super capacitors
instead of batteries,

290
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,160
which are apparently better,
and a motor in each wheel.

291
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,120
You can see them, and they glow
when it's running, which is cool.

292
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,160
But best of all, they say
it has self-healing bodywork.

293
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,040
It's got nanotubes in it,
which can detect damage,

294
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,680
and then repair it.

295
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,520
- How does that work?
- I don't know.

296
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
No, they said they've been
thinking outside the box to do it.

297
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,000
I think they've been thinking
inside the pub, haven't they?

298
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,760
With its self-healing...

299
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,000
No, but when that isn't a drawing
any more and is a real car,

300
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,320
and you went on a motor show stand
and ran a key down the side of it,

301
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,760
I bet they wouldn't say, "Well, that's
good, now we can watch it mend itself."

302
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,000
No, they might charge
after you, bellowing,

303
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,760
"I hope you've got nanotubes, chum.
You're going to get a kicking."

304
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,320
Things I'm excited about,
it's actually out about now.

305
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,280
Renault have a pickup truck.

306
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,480
- Look at that!
- What?

307
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,200
- Yeah.
- Why?

308
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,840
Because the whole world wants
one. Je suis un rouge neck.

309
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,760
Je suis un nerd-kicker.

310
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,920
I'm sorry to say
that won't work,

311
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,680
cos the Americans don't want a Renault and
the French don't want a pickup truck.

312
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,680
ISIS like a pickup truck,
don't they?

313
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,560
ISIS would...

314
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,480
- I'm just looking for a market.
- It's a good idea.

315
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,560
This is business,
that's what you do.

316
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,440
- No, if Renault ship them all out to Syria...
- Yeah?

317
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,840
"Oh, these crappy old Toyotas".

318
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,200
Shiny new Renault -
it won't start.

319
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,000
It would solve ISIS
in a heartbeat.

320
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,600
Global peace.

321
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,320
"The drone's coming!"

322
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,920
They'll be blown to pieces.

323
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,840
Thank you, Renault.
Well done, saved the world.

324
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,000
Renault has saved the world.

325
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,240
- Who knew?
- Yeah.

326
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,840
I tell you what I thought you'd like
most of all for this year, is this.

327
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,520
I do like the look of that.

328
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,000
That is the new... It's the
Dodge Challenger Demon.

329
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,240
It's basically an even more
powerful version of the Hellcat

330
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,600
I drove in the last series.
840 horsepower.

331
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,400
And it's got those
little wheels at the front

332
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,760
because it's set up there
for drag racing.

333
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,520
- But it looks like a T-Rex.
- What?

334
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,480
It's ridic... It's like that.
It's just stupid.

335
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,200
That's why T-Rexs died out,
they couldn't reach anything.

336
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,840
Well, they were good at drag
racing though, weren't they?

337
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,600
But they... they couldn't
even pleasure themselves.

338
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,080
Sorry?

339
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,000
Well, how would
a T-Rex pleasure himself?

340
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,240
How has your mind
even gone there?

341
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,040
I'm telling you--

342
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,680
- Is that why they were always in such a bad mood?
- Yes.

343
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,040
And that is the end
of Conversation Street.

344
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,640
Thank you very much.

345
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,080
Excellent, excellent.
Now...

346
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,440
Moving on, I would like to talk
a little about hot hatchbacks,

347
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,840
because I think they
might be getting a bit silly.

348
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,200
The AMG Mercedes A Class
develops 375 horsepower.

349
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,640
The Focus RS has 345 horsepower.

350
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,760
Why do you need that
much power in a hatchback?

351
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,760
- Well, James--
- Well, nothing.

352
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,840
Because I think it's time we
all just calmed down a bit.

353
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,480
This is the Golf GTI,

354
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,200
and it's a perfect illustration
of what I'm on about.

355
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,200
Yes, it is quick.
And it should be quick.

356
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,320
It's got more power
than a 1980s Ferrari.

357
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,040
But then again, it needs a lot of power
because it's so big and so heavy.

358
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,400
The hot hatch
wasn't always like this.

359
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,480
To show you what I mean,

360
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,480
here's the original Golf GTI
from 42 years ago.

361
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,960
And it's a very different
animal indeed.

362
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,560
Now that car wasn't
about massive rear leg room

363
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,840
or a big bulky body,

364
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,640
or a huge duvet
of sound deadening,

365
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,480
or all this equipment,
or any of that stuff.

366
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,120
It was just about
having a bit of a laugh,

367
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,880
darting around in
a biscuit-tin body of a car.

368
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,720
Sadly they don't
make 'em like that any more.

369
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,200
Well, except when they do.

370
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,160
This is the Volkswagen up!
- the smallest car VW sells.

371
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,560
And now
they've made a GTI version.

372
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,320
A car that's been created

373
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,160
to resurrect the spirit
of that original Mark I Golf.

374
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,880
In fact, the similarities
are uncanny.

375
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,480
Let's start with horsepower.

376
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,080
The original had just 108,

377
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,720
and the up! GTI
has a similarly modest 113,

378
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,400
giving both cars a 0-60 time

379
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,720
of around nine seconds.

380
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,080
It's also a little bit
'80s retro in here.

381
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,280
For a start, you
start it by turning a key.

382
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,240
There's no button to press for people who
want to pretend to be fighter pilots.

383
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,480
You change gear using a stick

384
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,760
and an old-fashioned
clutch pedal.

385
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,320
I haven't looked in the boot

386
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,760
but I expect there's a
miners' strike in there,

387
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,640
or the speeches
of Margaret Thatcher.

388
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,880
However, one of the reasons the
Mark I GTI was so much fun to drive

389
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,720
was because it was so light.

390
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,840
But the up!,
being a modern car,

391
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,800
weighs a portly 200kg more.

392
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,520
So, with all that extra
weight to lug around,

393
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,800
is the new boy actually
any fun on the move?

394
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,800
Well, its modernity
does pay under the bonnet.

395
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,680
This has just
a one-litre engine

396
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,360
with only three cylinders,

397
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,920
but it does have
a turbo-charger

398
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,480
for a bit of extra oomph.

399
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,760
And it makes
a fantastic growly noise.

400
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,880
Listen to this.

401
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,040
You don't get that
in a modern Golf GTI.

402
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,240
It's all smooth and asinine.

403
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,680
Now, that noise...
There it is, there.

404
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,560
It's a bit of a cheat because there's
something called a sound actuator

405
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,160
under the bonnet,

406
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,200
and it artificially pumps
that growl into the cabin.

407
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,520
But so what?

408
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,600
It's very satisfying.

409
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,120
So, the engine's
a bit of a hoot.

410
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,560
And, despite the extra weight,

411
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,160
the up!'s pretty nimble
through corners too.

412
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,280
Yeah, you see, small...

413
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,400
...chuckable...

414
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,720
...enjoyable.

415
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,360
It is proper fun.

416
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,200
Feels like I'm doing
hundreds of miles an hour.

417
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,800
You know what this is like? It's
a bit like an '80s action movie

418
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,160
where the same thing
blows up ten times.

419
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,800
And it's that compared
with say, a CGI blockbuster

420
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,960
full of amazing effects.

421
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,840
One is a simple laugh,

422
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,880
the other is a bit too bloated

423
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,640
and, frankly, up its own arse.

424
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,000
But even though the up!
harks back to simpler times,

425
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,320
it still comes
with climate control,

426
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,800
heated seats,

427
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,360
Bluetooth, a reversing camera

428
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,080
and, for when your
17-year-old borrows it,

429
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,920
traction control
that you can't turn off.

430
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,320
So it's quicker than it sounds.

431
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,400
It scampers around
like a spaniel,

432
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,080
and it's got just enough kick
to make it comfortable.

433
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,440
But no more than that.

434
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,040
And it gives you all this
for about £14,000.

435
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,760
Or, to put it another way,

436
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,920
it's half the price
of a new Golf GTI,

437
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,880
and, I honestly believe,
twice the fun.

438
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,120
I might actually want one.

439
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,200
Nice little car.
Nice little car.

440
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,440
- It is.
- So...

441
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,560
So that is...
that is interesting.

442
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,120
What you're saying is

443
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,920
the up! GTI is half the price
of a modern Golf GTI

444
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,280
and more fun.

445
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,480
Yeah, and cheaper to run. And actually,
to be honest, it's more characterful.

446
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,120
So really the conclusion is

447
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,480
that to own a Golf GTI,
you'd have to be a moron.

448
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,640
To be honest,
you'd have to be demented.

449
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,640
Shall we see how fast the up!
goes round the Eboladrome?

450
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,520
Oh, wait. You own a Golf GTI,
don't you?

451
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,880
Yes, I do.

452
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,120
I knew somebody had one.

453
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,760
It's when you said a moron, that's
when it all clicked into place.

454
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,960
Anyway, the lap.

455
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,400
Right, let's see
what you've got.

456
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,240
And she's off.

457
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,920
A murky day out there,

458
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,480
and I'm sure
she'd rather be in a Golf.

459
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,360
Onto the Isn't Straight.

460
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,040
Actual standing water out there,

461
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,880
but she's showing
no fear at all.

462
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,440
Smooth line through there.

463
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,600
Now trundling down
towards Your Name Here.

464
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,280
A Golf, of course,
would have arrived hours ago.

465
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,640
She still isn't there!
Come on!

466
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,320
The little up-exclamation-mark
GTI dawdling through there.

467
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,760
Golf GTI has a clever diff,
of course. This doesn't.

468
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,680
And now back onto the Isn't.

469
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,320
Perfect line along there...

470
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,200
And down the gears now
for Old Lady's House.

471
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,640
Well, not yet but in a minute
she will be. Hang on.

472
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,880
Any minute now...

473
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,240
There she is,
down through the gears.

474
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,520
Will it understeer through here?

475
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,280
No, cos of course you can't
turn off the traction control

476
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,960
whereas you can in a Golf GTI

477
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
cos it's a car for
brave and brilliant people.

478
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,880
Right, down the Bumpy Back
Straight to Substation.

479
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,720
It really is awful weather
out there.

480
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,240
If she was in a Golf,
it'd be sunny.

481
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,120
Uh... right, just the last
corner to crawl round.

482
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,520
There it is,
and across the line.

483
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,040
Right, let's find out

484
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,440
where it goes on the board,
shall we?

485
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,440
Let's have a look.

486
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,800
Ha!

487
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,840
Literally
the slowest car in the world.

488
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,280
Yeah, but it was
chucking it down. Come on.

489
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,960
So you're saying
if it had been dry

490
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,600
it would have challenged
the Aston Martin Vulcan?

491
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,880
- Yes, it would.
- Anyway, we must move it on

492
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,120
because it is time to play
Celebrity Face Off.

493
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,720
Thank you.

494
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,920
And once again we are
asking an important question,

495
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,240
and it's this.

496
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,840
Who is the fastest person
in the world

497
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,960
who has a failed
former career in a band?

498
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,600
Well, to help us find out,
please welcome...

499
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,560
Dominic Cooper and Bill Bailey!

500
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,120
Thank you very much.

501
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,720
Twins!

502
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,480
They're literally twins.

503
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,720
- Hello.
- Welcome.

504
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,680
- Cheers, thank you.
- Have a seat.

505
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,080
- Welcome, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

506
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,400
Welcome, welcome.
I have to tell you,

507
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,000
I had a great one
last night, Dominic.

508
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,480
I actually met you in
a restaurant just last night.

509
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,920
No, no.

510
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,480
Exactly, that was the problem.

511
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,800
I was with a couple of
theatrical and film people.

512
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,560
I said you were coming on the show, and
they went, "He's on the next table."

513
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,720
So I went over and
actually said to this person,

514
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,120
"I hear you're coming
on the show."

515
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,600
He went,
"What are you talking about?"

516
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,800
You went over
to someone that wasn't me,

517
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,160
persuaded by the people
you were with that it was me.

518
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,120
- Yes but it was incredible--
- Who was it?

519
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,520
He was a complete stranger.
He thinks Jeremy Clarkson--

520
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,400
Perhaps it was Danny Dyer.

521
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,560
No.

522
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,920
No, no, no, no, no.

523
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,560
That is not fair.

524
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,440
So I made a bit of a fool
of myself. Anyway, right...

525
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,400
Well, thank goodness you
hadn't done that before.

526
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,360
It's a new experience.

527
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,680
Phew.

528
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,080
That was a lucky escape.

529
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,040
Oh, dear.

530
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,960
Anyway, the link,
of course, between you two

531
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,560
is that you both had failed
careers in bands early on.

532
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,800
- Yes.
- I wouldn't say failed.

533
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,640
I don't... Fail, really?

534
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,760
- Well...
- Interesting, uh...

535
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,240
What's success,
in terms of a band?

536
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,400
Well, OK, I think,
were you not once,

537
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,680
the band
outnumbered the audience?

538
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,320
- Every time we played.
- That's a failure.

539
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,880
Is it?

540
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,400
It is, I'd call that a failure.

541
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,280
Well, there was one
particular gig in Greenwich

542
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,880
where, yeah, there
was one audience member.

543
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,480
- One?
- Five band members,

544
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,200
- one audience member, yeah.
- Oh, that's tricky.

545
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,520
You...
before you start with the...

546
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,960
What was your band called?

547
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,800
Well, the band
was called the Famous Five

548
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,040
and there was
actually four people in it.

549
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,320
And nobody had heard of us,

550
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,760
so it sort of
didn't make any sense.

551
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,440
We...
We did have a photo shoot

552
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,480
and the drummer
was quite a vain man,

553
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,840
and he decided what a
great idea it would be to...

554
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,960
if we all painted our little
fingers with black nail varnish,

555
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,960
because that looked cool, right?

556
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,720
Then we saw the photo shoot

557
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,760
and it looks like we've all
trapped our hand in a door.

558
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,720
Just looks really stupid.

559
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,600
Now, I've got a question from Richard
Hammond... cos I was in a band.

560
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,400
We were talking
about this the other day.

561
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,320
James May was in a band,
He was in a band.

562
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,320
He still wears socks down the front
of his underpants to do the show.

563
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,400
Whoa! What?

564
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,680
He was wondering, did you ever put
anything down the front of your--

565
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,640
I did not ask that!

566
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,560
You did! You said, "Can you
ask them what they put..."

567
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,000
You've written
that down yourself!

568
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,840
Well, I may have
made it up a bit.

569
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,440
But you never went down
that route?

570
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,760
- Yeah.
- No.

571
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,480
- You did?
- No. No, no, no, never. Did you?

572
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,360
Well, very recently, cos I
had to wear a lot of spandex

573
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,120
in the thing I'm filming
at the moment,

574
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,560
all-in-one spandex...
sort of...

575
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,880
- This is Mamma Mia 2.
- '70s ABBA suit, yeah.

576
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,960
So we were all discussing, it was quite a
logistical and quite problematic thing.

577
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,880
It makes you look like
you have absolutely

578
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,160
very little going on
in that department.

579
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,640
So we had to decide whether,
and what we would use to...

580
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,200
- Right.
- Do you know what I mean?

581
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,000
What did you put down
the front of your trousers?

582
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,520
This is what Hammond was asking.

583
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,520
I wasn't asking,
just to be clear.

584
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,400
I tried two make-up
sponges at first.

585
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,960
Two make-up...

586
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,120
Anyway, listen,
we've got to get on to cars.

587
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,240
- You're united, I think, by a love of French cars.
- Yes.

588
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,880
- Cos you have a Citroen DS.
- I do.

589
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,880
- Beautiful.
- Which is beautiful.

590
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,080
- Stunning car.
- It's the most beautiful car ever made.

591
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,440
- There...
- I agree.

592
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,080
And... it's a piece of work.

593
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,960
And why did you
buy such a thing?

594
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,240
Why?

595
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,040
Well, because
of the Icelandic volcano

596
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,400
with the unpronounceable name,

597
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,440
Eyjally-jolly-joffakabl...

598
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,200
...when it erupted and there was the
big ash cloud, we were trapped.

599
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,920
We were in southern Spain,
couldn't get home.

600
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,160
All the flights were cancelled.

601
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,800
The ferries were full.

602
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,960
We thought we'd get
the train back through France

603
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,440
but, of course, perfectly,

604
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,320
the French decided
to have a rail strike

605
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,440
during the time of the greatest
travel upheaval in recent memory.

606
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,360
"Non, I don't care.
I don't care about you."

607
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,240
But there's no flights.
"Non... uh."

608
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,560
So we...

609
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,720
I just... Just checking
my blood pressure.

610
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,040
So... So what happened was we thought:

611
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,320
let's just buy a car
and drive home in it.

612
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,600
And then I thought: well,
let's not just buy any car,

613
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,800
let's buy the car
I've always wanted to own.

614
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,440
So we found a little garage
just outside Marseille

615
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,760
and it was wrecks of every kind
of French car you could imagine,

616
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,480
but amongst them
was this old black DS

617
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,760
and it was a
bit of a wreck, but it went.

618
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,880
- And it got you home.
- It got us home.

619
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,320
And then,
over the last few years,

620
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,760
I've refurbed it
into its former glory.

621
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,280
- Do you still drive it around today?
- I still drive it around today.

622
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,680
Now, you started
on this Citroen thing.

623
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,400
Did you learn to drive in a 2CV?

624
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,480
Yes, I did, in a field.

625
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,040
The thing about the 2CV is
if you learn in one of those,

626
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,880
and I've often wondered that, when
you get into an actual proper car...

627
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,200
don't you think: well, I don't
know what anything does.

628
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,800
Cos the gear lever's all in a different
place and everything feels different.

629
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,080
Yeah, the gear's
all backwards isn't it?

630
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,480
And it didn't help that my stepdad at
the time put the engine in backwards

631
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,640
so it had four reverse gears
and one forward.

632
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,360
That's what he did
at that particular point.

633
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,600
But they're so simple.

634
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,720
And the fan.
They had those fan...

635
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,480
They... just had a fan, you just opened...
just a hole into the...

636
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,600
I loved the basic nature
of it, you know?

637
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,120
You could open it with
just a screwdriver, a coin.

638
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,200
I had a...
I had a Citroen Dyane,

639
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,560
which, if you can believe it, is
the more basic version of the 2CV.

640
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,440
And I left it parked up
somewhere and I forgot my key.

641
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,840
And I thought: nah,
don't worry, I can break in.

642
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,640
So I broke into my own car
and I got into the back seat

643
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,200
and there was
a child seat there,

644
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,440
and I thought:
I don't have a child. Oh, no.

645
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,040
Oh, dear.

646
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,320
And uh...

647
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,120
But it's very easy to put back
together again, you know.

648
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,000
- For when the real owner comes back.
- Yes.

649
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,480
Cos your first car,
not French, was that...

650
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,640
- No.
- It was a Healey?

651
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,600
Austin Healey Sprite, yeah.

652
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,640
Oh, a Sprite, right,
not a big Healey.

653
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,280
Not a 3000. It's tiny. I don't
know how I dared drive it.

654
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,760
Actually, it was my brother's,

655
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,200
and I needed to get
to Stratford to do a play

656
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,960
and I don't know why or how I had
the nerve. I wasn't insured.

657
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,840
The car had a hole about that
high above the petrol tank

658
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,880
so you could put 55p's worth of petrol
in it, which would get you there.

659
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,760
- Had no wipers - wipers on strings.
- Like an Uber driver.

660
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,520
And one headlight.

661
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,720
So what are you running now?

662
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,840
The Healey: the Healey around
London and an Audi RS7.

663
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,400
Hang on, so you
still have the Healey, and...

664
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,840
Yeah, I got another one.

665
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,280
From eBay.
It works quite well.

666
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,480
- Really?
- Yeah.

667
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
It's the only thing that's ever
turned up, that I bought on eBay.

668
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,160
And yeah, it's quite good.

669
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,800
Because it's interesting, you both
drive old cars, and why would you?

670
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,720
Because you are
quite a speedy driver.

671
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,200
Oh, well, I like the speed.

672
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,920
I like to go fast.

673
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,600
How many points did you get
on your licence at one point?

674
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,440
Uh... Well, all of them.

675
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,680
You know, I had 12 points

676
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,760
and then I went over
the 12 points

677
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,840
and I had to go on
a speed awareness course,

678
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,760
and I've done that
three times now.

679
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,560
So I'm quite used to that.

680
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,080
- So you do get pulled a lot?
- Yes.

681
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,440
I was driving down to Devon

682
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,160
and I forgot to put my seatbelt.

683
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,080
My bad, terrible thing to do.

684
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,400
I'd just pulled out of the service
station, I hadn't had it on.

685
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,200
I was in the process of
putting it on.

686
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,320
And anyway, so I got pulled
over and the copper,

687
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,400
he said, "Right",
he goes, "Now." He was from up north.

688
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,240
He goes, "Very dangerous, what you
did there." I went, "Oh, yeah."

689
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,040
He said, "You know
the band Def Leppard?"

690
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,200
And I said, "Yeah,
I know the band Def Leppard".

691
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,120
He goes,
"Yeah. You know the drummer?

692
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,480
You know, lost his arm?
He wasn't wearing a seatbelt.

693
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,640
He was thrown from
the vehicle, lost his arm."

694
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,360
And I went, "Oh, right."

695
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,640
And he goes, "His girlfriend,
she was wearing a seatbelt.

696
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,200
Killed instantly."

697
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,640
What was his point?

698
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,200
I don't know. It didn't back
up his story at all, did it?

699
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,520
Right, so anyway.

700
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,480
You came here, you did
all this, and... was it fun?

701
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,160
It was great fun, on the track.

702
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,600
I just loved it, loved
every second of it, yeah.

703
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,960
Trying to work out
whose lap shall we see first.

704
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,360
- We'll go... You're nearest.
- All right.

705
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,960
Shall we have
a look at Bill's lap?

706
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,760
- Yes!
- Yeah.

707
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,400
- Let's see it.
- I'm very worried about this.

708
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,840
And away we go. It's
looking good today, the Jag.

709
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,440
- It is.
- Ha-ha.

710
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,640
Lovely lady of acceleration.

711
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,720
Few helmet issues
there, if I may be so bold.

712
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,080
- I know.
- Jimmy Carr once--

713
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,000
Looks like I've been punched...

714
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,560
A fat kid stuck in a lift.

715
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,800
That's a bit steady through
there, but I agree with that,

716
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,840
because otherwise it's a bit tricky
when you get onto the gravel.

717
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,800
Yes.

718
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,480
Holding it nicely together...
into Difficult Bit One.

719
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,880
Tricky bit there,
that was pretty good.

720
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,840
You're so good at this!

721
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,480
Oh, horrible gravel,
horrible gravel.

722
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,920
Horrible gravel.

723
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,640
In to the gravel.
Holding it nicely through.

724
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,520
- That's very well done, got to be honest, Bill.
- Not too bad.

725
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,240
No, right, now
into Difficult Bit Two.

726
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,960
This is tricky, this is tricky.

727
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,760
Oh, you're in the
thick gravel now, that's...

728
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,640
I was in the horrible,
nasty thick stuff there.

729
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,240
Slow you down. Now, coming
back on the track, very slippery here.

730
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,560
That's very slippery.

731
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,640
- Suddenly the...
- Oh!

732
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,600
Suddenly you just... There's
a bit of fishtailing because...

733
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,120
- That's all right.
- ...you're back on the tarmac.

734
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,160
Right, now we're
into the very fast bit now.

735
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,280
Very exciting.

736
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,800
There's a man who
likes a bit of speed.

737
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,160
And... Oh, it's a couple
of lines chosen for there.

738
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
And another one there.

739
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,040
Coming up to the final corner.
Little bit of understeer,

740
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,200
but not like Casey the
Bear Man had the other day.

741
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,840
And there we are,
across the line, everybody.

742
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,880
Well done.

743
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,920
- Well done.
- I'm furious, furious.

744
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,880
Looked good.

745
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,000
That did look good.
Now, Dominic, um...

746
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,080
You had a bit
of a problem with...

747
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,280
- What's that?
- Well, with one of your practice laps.

748
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,720
Would anybody like to see?

749
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,440
Yes!

750
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,320
- Which bit?
- This bit.

751
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,240
Here he comes.

752
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,760
And onto the slippery bit.

753
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,400
Oh, oopsy-daisy.

754
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,720
Yes, yes, yes.
Straight back on the track!

755
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,080
This is what I love,
keeping it going, yes!

756
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,720
That was very good.

757
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,920
Yeah. It was a bad moment.
That was a bad moment.

758
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,000
Eventually,
you got a lap put together.

759
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,720
- Would you like to see it?
- Yes!

760
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,640
- Here we go.
- It's just not going to be as good.

761
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,520
It always seems to take
a while getting off the line.

762
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,720
I'm going to have to break
quite hard into this corner.

763
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,040
Aargh!

764
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,440
OK, now you've got to...
Hang on, let's listen.

765
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,680
Oh, feathering the throttle through there.
That's nicely done.

766
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,680
Holding it as we head
toward the gravel.

767
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,520
Yeah, you can see it
starting to fishtail.

768
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,200
That is slightly bowel-loosening
when it does that.

769
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,440
Yep.

770
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,640
Very wide through there, through the...
It looks like it's manure.

771
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,840
Come on, car!

772
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,640
- Blaming the car.
- Cars respond when you shout at them.

773
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,200
It's what people don't
understand, but they do.

774
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,720
It's such good
fun, that gravel bit.

775
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,080
That's tidy through there.

776
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,120
- Right, Difficult Bit Two.
- Tidy.

777
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,920
Sometimes tidy is fast.

778
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,320
Sometimes it isn't, I admit,
but it is... could be.

779
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,200
More fishtailing there. You've got
to try and get it right for this.

780
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,880
Can you do it properly this
time? Yeah, look at that!

781
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,920
Now, this is
the corner, this is the one.

782
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,680
It's greasy.
Was it very slippery?

783
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,640
It's hard coming out
of the gravel onto the tarmac.

784
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,760
Be confident!
Keep going, keep going!

785
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,000
It is exciting
because you're supposed--

786
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,560
As though I'm going to stop.

787
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,640
It's just... Ooh, there's another
one... Ooh, shall I turn? Ooh, maybe not.

788
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,960
There we go, coming up now
to the last corner.

789
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,960
You can lose so much time here, but
I don't think you are doing there.

790
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,640
And there we are,
across the line, everyone.

791
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,400
- Well done.
- Thank you.

792
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,640
- That is such fun.
- Oh, the best.

793
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,120
I've got the times here.

794
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,760
Oh-ho-ho...

795
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,360
- Bill Bailey.
- Yes.

796
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,880
- It's a 1.25.1 is what it is.
- All right, then.

797
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,360
Now, it's a good time.

798
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,280
A greasy track out there.

799
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,680
- It was wet. It was wet.
- Greasy.

800
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,600
Yeah, no question. That's a greasy track
out there, and that's pretty good.

801
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,440
- Times we've been having, that's ballpark.
- OK.

802
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,560
They've been in the dry
so you can be proud.

803
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,000
Dominic Cooper.

804
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,720
One...

805
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,760
twenty...

806
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,440
3.6.

807
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,920
Well done.

808
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,600
- Congratulations.
- I thought I'd failed!

809
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,120
So there we are,
ladies and gentlemen,

810
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,040
let's get this right, shall we?

811
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,800
It's Bill Bailey and the
fastest person with a beard

812
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,240
who went on into
either stand-up or acting

813
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,120
with a failed
early career in a band,

814
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,960
- Dominic Cooper!
- Yay.

815
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,320
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Very good.

816
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,480
Now, if you go on the Internet,

817
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,240
there's lots of films on there with
people skidding around in cars.

818
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,200
I've got an example here
of what I'm on about.

819
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,120
Yes, yes.

820
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,920
I know what you're thinking.

821
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,280
You're thinking:
Oh, that's very impressive.

822
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,520
You're thinking that's
very impressive, but is it?

823
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,560
Well, yes, it is.

824
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,080
That's the thing. I don't think it is.
Anyone could do it.

825
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,440
- Well, no they couldn't.
- They could, seriously.

826
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,200
Because every time
you make a mistake

827
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,680
you cut to a shot of the rev
counter, or changing gear.

828
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,120
Yeah? Or your face
looking a bit heroic,

829
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,920
and then you get back
to the action again.

830
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,400
It's just editing.

831
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,080
I think it's a bit more
complicated than that.

832
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,680
No, it isn't, honestly. And
I decided to prove my point

833
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,480
by making a skidding-about
film of my own, OK?

834
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,800
No, it's really simple, OK?

835
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,200
You just need a pretentious
opening with some smoke

836
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,080
and then lots of shots of me
looking heroic like that.

837
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,880
- Why are you doing that?
- So I look heroic, like that.

838
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,840
- Well, you don't.
- I do, and I will.

839
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,200
- This will be good.
- It is.

840
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,080
- I bet it isn't.
- It is.

841
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

842
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,720
Why have you stopped it?
Why did you stop it?

843
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,240
Because...
Because it's rubbish.

844
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,160
It isn't rubbish. The ladies and gentlemen
were enjoying it. Were you enjoying that?

845
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,200
- Yes!
- Exactly. Why did you stop it?

846
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,600
Because the whole thing is fake.

847
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,680
What was faked in that?

848
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,520
All right, take that
rev counter shot for a start.

849
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,080
Pull it up, let's have a look.

850
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,840
OK, so you are doing 6750rpm
and no miles an hour.

851
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,440
Speedometer was broken.

852
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,560
- Was it?
- Yes, it was.

853
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,000
What about that bit where your feet
were dancing around on the pedals?

854
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,840
- You know, that bit.
- Skilful work.

855
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,880
- Really?
- Yeah, it was.

856
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,120
Would anybody like to see the
unedited footage of how he did that?

857
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,200
- Yes!
- Yes we would, we would yes.

858
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,400
- Is there a GoPro in here?
- Yeah.

859
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,760
So I can get my feet wiggling around
on the pedals and we can cut that in?

860
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,640
- Yeah.
- Good.

861
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,520
Heel and toe, heel and toe...

862
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,760
Shall we wobble
the car a bit as well?

863
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,400
Yeah, rock it.

864
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,720
And then drop these in
just every so often.

865
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,440
Yeah.

866
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,640
Do the gear change as well.
We can paint the windows out.

867
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,880
Do we need to get
a rev counter shot, Phil?

868
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,840
We'll just... We'll just
stick a camera on here.

869
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,160
- Like that, on there.
- OK.

870
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,640
We can use that one
from the footwell.

871
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,600
Yeah.

872
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,680
Got it?

873
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,400
Totally convincing. I'm keeping it
so that it looks like it's in gear,

874
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,120
you know, not just revving it:

875
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,440
No, wait.

876
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,960
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

877
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,160
And then...
Then there was that bit

878
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,480
where you were doughnuting around
in the barn, remember that?

879
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,880
- Can we remember that?
- What about it?

880
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,440
Who would like to see
the rushes of that one?

881
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,000
Let's see what was on the cutting room floor.

882
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,920
What scene's this, scene four?

883
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,400
Scenes two to seven in-car.

884
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,680
So I just look heroic.

885
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,600
Yeah, but you've really got to throw
it in and give it a bit of oppo, yeah?

886
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,320
Yeah. I can do that.

887
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,920
20 years of practice.

888
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,240
Farmkana, the introduction.
Take one.

889
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,800
Handbrake!

890
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,600
Had an accident.

891
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,400
Damn.

892
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,280
Oh, shit.

893
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,920
- Got it?
- Yeah.

894
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,880
- I look pretty good.
- Nice one.

895
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,840
It... it didn't, it didn't
look good though, did it?

896
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,080
No, and on that terrible
disappointment--

897
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,120
No, no, no. No.

898
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,720
- No, no, no.
- We haven't got time for any more of your nonsense.

899
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,480
Oh, yes, we have, cos we
haven't got to that bit yet

900
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,480
where you slid through
the gate, remember?

901
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,080
- Oh, for God's sake!
- Who wants to see what happened there?

902
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,640
- Nobody does!
- The truth.

903
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,520
Speed.

904
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,680
Farmkana: The Gate.
Take one.

905
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,160
Let's do this!

906
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,840
Oh, shit.

907
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,720
I may have clipped
something there.

908
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,920
Damn. Sorry about that, Phil.

909
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,240
Well, from now on we just...

910
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,120
Why can't we shoot everything
from the other side?

911
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,480
I can't do that cos the car's
turning around all the time.

912
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,040
I can't just film from one side. It's
going to look absolutely terrible.

913
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,960
But if you...
You can barely see that.

914
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,640
Well, you can, look, it's...

915
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,680
Why don't we just mend the fence
and have another go at it?

916
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,960
The Gate. Take two.

917
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,920
Concentrating, concentrating.

918
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,200
And turn, and flick!

919
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,640
Oh, dearie me.

920
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,360
He's done it again.
What a massive twat.

921
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,800
- You just can't do it.
- I can.

922
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,480
- You can't.
- Well, I clipped it once.

923
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,040
I'm getting better.

924
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,520
It's still not going through
smoothly, is it?

925
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,240
Could you just rebuild it
once more, honestly?

926
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,720
I think I know what the problem is.
My angle's too shallow.

927
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,920
So I'm going to come up this side
of the bog and swing it round.

928
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,920
The Gate. Take three.

929
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,280
Action when you're ready.

930
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,760
Turn... yank, let go, power.

931
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,760
Action when you're ready.

932
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,640
Right, here we go.

933
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,400
And handbrake! Oh, shit, that's
the bloody...

934
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,040
What happened was...
You won't believe this,

935
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,320
but I went for the handbrake,

936
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,080
but I changed
into second by mistake.

937
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,760
- Properly wedged it in there.
- Yeah.

938
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,360
Well, at least we don't have
to reset the gatepost again.

939
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,000
Exactly. There, you see. That's the
sort of bright thinking I like.

940
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,000
That's not a good thing, though.

941
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,480
- What?
- Cos that's worse.

942
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,520
Phil, let's get the other guy
in the car.

943
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,400
Can somebody get Mark?

944
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,080
- Oh, don't show this.
- I should explain.

945
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,080
That is three-times British
Rally Champion Mark Higgins.

946
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,400
If you just drive through
there about...

947
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,800
- I was doing about 85, 90.
- Right.

948
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,400
And I wasn't quite getting it.

949
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,160
So if you could just come
through there, sideways,

950
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,520
power up and power out.

951
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,520
Right.

952
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,080
Thing is,
you'll have to wear that.

953
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,720
It's me - it's what
they use in Hollywood.

954
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,320
Yeah, but how
can I see through them?

955
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,120
Yes, you do.
Just look through the slits.

956
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,000
Put it on, seriously, it works.

957
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,200
This is what they use. All
Hollywood stunt drivers use them

958
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,800
if they want to look...
Then you... and just...

959
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,800
It's like looking in a mirror.

960
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,560
- That is... Look.
- What?

961
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,120
Seriously, can you tell that
that's not... Look at this.

962
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,360
Identical.
Now, put your helmet on.

963
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,800
- What, on top of this?
- Yeah.

964
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,720
Shall we see what Mark looked
like with the helmet on?

965
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,920
- Yes.
- Shall we?

966
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,480
It's uncanny,
it really is, look at that.

967
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,280
What it is is wanton cruelty
on your part.

968
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,680
But anyway, listen.

969
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,480
I did use Mark
for that one scene, I admit.

970
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,040
Yeah, you did.

971
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,120
It's a shame you didn't use him for the
sheep-herding scene though, isn't it?

972
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,960
Don't show that.

973
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,040
No, no seriously,
do not show that.

974
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,960
Action, Jeremy,
when you're ready.

975
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,640
So I've got to get these sheep

976
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,080
in that pen in the far corner,

977
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:42,360
in an exciting and exuberant...
YouTubey way. Here we go.

978
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,480
Speed and power,
that's the solution.

979
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,040
Duh... uh, nothing!

980
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,920
Right, just get these stragglers...

981
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,400
Don't go...

982
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,760
Come on!

983
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,520
Oh, shit!

984
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,880
I can't believe this.

985
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,680
Listen, you can either
round them up really slowly,

986
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,000
which is quite
boring television,

987
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,920
or you can give it some of that.

988
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,600
And if you give it some of that,

989
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,960
which is exciting for
the ladies and gentlemen,

990
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,680
you're inevitably
going to hit some sheep.

991
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,480
You've done one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

992
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,000
eight, nine, ten, 11 sheep.

993
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,160
And broken the windscreen.

994
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,800
I think the windscreen is the least of
our worries, to be honest with you.

995
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,280
Well, not really,
not for continuity,

996
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,200
cos it's hard to cover that up.

997
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,920
This isn't how they do it
on the normal film.

998
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,200
Well, how do they do it?

999
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,840
- Well, he doesn't crash it every five minutes.
- I haven't crashed it.

1000
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,560
You have crashed it,
and you've killed things now.

1001
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,760
Well, a bit...

1002
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,080
What? No.

1003
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:01,160
Please, don't...
Don't clap. He's a murderer.

1004
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,400
They... they would have been
jumpers by now, or Sunday lunch.

1005
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,160
It's not the end of the world.

1006
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,240
No, all right, but the next
bit nearly was, wasn't it?

1007
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,040
How the... How am
I going to film with that?

1008
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,120
Phil?

1009
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,040
Rolled it.

1010
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,760
Just make it go
the other way up,

1011
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,320
whenever you've got a moment.

1012
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,440
Now I know what it's like
to be Richard Hammond.

1013
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,800
Thanks, chaps.

1014
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,200
- We can edit that out.
- No, we can't. Look at it.

1015
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,840
What? Look at what?
The door...

1016
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,240
This, look. I can't do
any of the drone shots now.

1017
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,280
This is all smashed to bits.
This is wrong.

1018
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,320
- You're such a fusspot.
- Oil's come out of it.

1019
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,080
Honestly.
It still works well.

1020
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,600
Pull that towards...

1021
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,400
- Completely...
- You haven't asked about me.

1022
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,800
You're fine, aren't you?
You've got your helmet on.

1023
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,880
- No.
- They didn't care.

1024
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,520
I was risking my life for the
ladies and gentlemen. Nobody cares.

1025
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,600
- What?
- Right, all right.

1026
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,360
Let's move on
to the end of your film.

1027
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,480
The big finale?
Which was brilliant.

1028
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,960
- Hmm, yeah. Well, it wasn't, was it?
- Yes, it was.

1029
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,960
No, well, this is the bit,
ladies and gentlemen,

1030
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,920
where Jeremy attempted
to jump over a river.

1031
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,080
- I did jump over a river.
- No, you didn't.

1032
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,520
- I did.
- No, you didn't, as we shall now prove.

1033
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,160
Dyke Jump. Take one.

1034
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,160
Action, action.

1035
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,040
Let's do this!

1036
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,680
Sorry!

1037
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,680
What a prick.

1038
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,040
Erm...

1039
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,400
Really it now.

1040
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,360
Yeah, no, I think
that's pretty much had it.

1041
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,400
- Look at it, look at it.
- I know!

1042
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,640
- I've... We've...
- We haven't got an ending.

1043
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,960
- You're supposed to go over.
- We'll just use another car.

1044
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,600
- It's the big stunt.
- I've got a backup car.

1045
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,400
We'll use that.

1046
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,800
Is that it?
Is that enough now?

1047
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,200
- Nearly.
- No.

1048
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,760
Right, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1049
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,400
- Let's move on, shall we...
- You're not still going on about--

1050
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,560
No, I am, because
I think we would like to see

1051
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,680
the grand finale
of Jeremy's film

1052
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,520
and his backup car, yes?

1053
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,280
- Yes!
- Yes, right.

1054
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,600
Oh, shit.

1055
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,840
No. No, I'm sorry.

1056
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,240
Hold on.

1057
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,440
Your backup car, it was an Audi.

1058
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,160
OK, who here... Who here
noticed that was an Audi?

1059
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,160
Yes!

1060
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,480
Yeah, so everybody noticed
that because it was obvious.

1061
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,480
I tell you what, why don't
you explain to everyone

1062
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,520
how magicians cut
a lady in half in a box?

1063
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,160
- I don't know how that's done.
- Exactly, cos it's magic!

1064
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,920
People don't want to know
how it's done.

1065
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,080
And nobody wanted to know
how I had made my film.

1066
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,640
And you told them, and now
you've spoiled everybody's year.

1067
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,800
- Year?
- And on that terrible disappointment,

1068
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,240
it is time to end this time.

1069
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,640
Thank you so much for watching.

1070
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,800
I'm sorry about these two.

1071
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,960
See you next time. Goodbye.
