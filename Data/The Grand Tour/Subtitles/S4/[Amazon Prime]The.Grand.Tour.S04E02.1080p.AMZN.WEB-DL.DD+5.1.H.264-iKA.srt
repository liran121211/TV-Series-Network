Hello, and welcome to
what is very obviously
the South of France.

the South of France

This isn't even

This is 5,700 miles south
of the South of France.

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,120
It's a tiny volcanic island
in the Indian Ocean
called Réunion.

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,880
It is weird, isn't it?
Cos this isn't like
a French protectorate.

13
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,440
It's actually France.

-You know the flight
from Paris to here?
-Yeah.

And because of
the time difference,

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,120
this was the first place in
the world where a euro
exchange happened.

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,640
-Yes, and wasn't it
for, like, a bag of lychees?
-It was.

25
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:03,040
Now, I'll admit that Bentley
forged its reputation many
years ago at Le Mans,

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,400
which is in the north
of France.

27
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,120
But it's changed since then.

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,080
Now it's the most South of
France brand of them all.

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,720
The recipe's
still the same, though.

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,760
It's a big, heavy suet
pudding of torque
and opulence.

Yeah. (LAUGHS)

This is the first time ever
on our adventures

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,440
when I've had a proper,
functioning, decent car.

Whatever Mr Wilman
has in mind,
this'll be... perfect.

It's light, 1500 kilos,
and it's clever.

It has torque vectoring. It
can send up to 70% of the
total power to the rear axle.

of that to one wheel.

I've done this properly.

I've come in this.

This is a Caterham.

It is a 310R, to be precise.

It is a bit of a faff
getting in, admittedly,
but once you are in,

the rewards are enormous

was born in the '50s,

And there are
a lot of rockfalls on it.

problem by dangling wire mesh
down the side of the cliffs,

but that hasn't
really worked.

up with is... pretty radical.

I've got the least weight.

and four-wheel drive

those things in a drag race.

He was called The Buzzard.
Big nose he had as well.

170
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,000
There is more on Neville's
piece of paper if you could
just keep quiet for a moment.

171
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,480
It says, "On his way to the
scaffold he threw a coded
message into the crowd

172
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,200
that explained where
he had buried his treasure.

173
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,600
A copy of that message is
included in your pack."

174
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,760
Is that it?

175
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,400
That's it, yes.

176
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,880
-Well, it's just garbage.
-No, but here's the good bit.

177
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,480
"It's reckoned that his
treasure included
the Fiery Cross of Goa,

178
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,240
a 220-pound, seven-foot high
golden crucifix studded
with rubies

179
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,000
and that today the haul
would be worth £100 million."

180
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,440
-Wow.
-So?

181
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,000
"So it's your job to crack
the code and find the loot.

182
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,480
Your sincerely,
Neville Wilman."

183
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,480
Oh, we are hunting
for pirate treasure?

184
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,880
-Yes, we are.
-Oh, come on.

185
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,280
Do you believe in
all this pirate nonsense?

186
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,640
What do you mean, "believe"?

187
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,240
Yes. Pirates were pirates.

188
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,640
Pirates knock
on your door and say,

189
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,000
"I've got this
knocked-off copy of the
Avengers: Endgame.

190
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,360
Do you wanna buy it?
It's only five quid."
That's a pirate.

191
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,080
Yeah, pirate now.
Pirates then, they had style.
This one...

192
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,480
-So we've gotta crack that...
-Yes.

193
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,600
...and that'll tell us
where this, The Buzzard...
-Yes.

194
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,400
...buried his treasure?

195
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,800
Yes.

196
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,680
Well, how are you
gonna crack that?

197
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,720
This is so up his street.

198
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,480
What's happened here
is very straightforward.

199
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,800
He loves pirates, you...
what do you like doing?

200
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,920
-Cracking codes.
Doing Sudoku.
-Crosswords.

201
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,640
What do I do?

202
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,840
Well, you can have your...
We'll be pirates,
we'll split the treasure.

203
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,160
I'm not going to be a pirate.

204
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,720
Oh, so we won't
split the treasure?

205
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,840
If you want to share
in the £100 million,
and I suggest you do,

206
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,720
you could maybe
muck in a bit.

207
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,400
You can help digging.

208
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,840
I can't be doing
with pirates. It's all...

209
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,120
All right,
so you don't want any?

210
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,720
Well, I mean,
I'll have it if it's there.

211
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,880
Oh, will you?

212
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,640
JAMES: Back at the hotel,
I started on the code...

213
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,480
while Nick and Margaret
sat in the background,
being annoying.

214
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,800
Would it help if I built you
a machine made of brass
and copper and transistors?

215
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,760
I heard if you drink
a glass of water like that
whilst looking at it...

216
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,720
-Have you thought about,
A is one...
-That's clever.

217
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,560
-B is two...
-Oh, that's clever.

218
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,280
-No, wait, wait.
-What?

219
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,440
-I've already had
a breakthrough.
-What?

220
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,320
Why don't you two go away
and leave me alone
to work on it by myself?

221
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,160
It is a bit boring, this.

222
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,400
Not very piratey thus far.

223
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,640
JEREMY:
So Richard and I left James
Turing to get on with it.

224
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,920
So La Buse...

225
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,880
(MUTTERS)

226
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,360
It's a shame
we can't go swimming.

227
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,680
Why can't we?

228
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,080
It's against the law.

229
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,360
What, swimming's illegal?

230
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,600
No, it really is.

231
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,760
Because between
2011 and 2016,

232
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,120
there were 43 fatal shark
attacks around the world.

233
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,520
19 were in the waters
off Réunion.

234
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,200
-Out there?
-Yeah.

235
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,680
Well, look,
it's only shallow.

236
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,640
If a shark comes,
we can jump it.

237
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,120
I think we did that in 2013.

238
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,760
(CHUCKLING)

239
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,840
(TICKING)

240
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,960
JEREMY: Do you only read
pirate books?

241
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,720
If it's got a pirate ship
on it, you're gonna
read it, aren't you?

242
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,520
It's exciting. There was
derring-do and adventuring.

243
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,120
The Lioness of Brittany,
1330 thereabouts.

244
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,960
She had a fleet of five
or six black ships
called the Black Fleet.

245
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,160
She had them all painted
black with red flags.
How cool is that?

246
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,360
JEREMY:
On the third day, we were
running out of activities,

247
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,720
so we went to see
how Alan was getting on.

248
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,120
-Have you got anywhere?
-Yes.

249
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,360
Where?

250
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,760
After a two-headed dog...

251
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,240
you take some honey.

252
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,960
Three days and that's it?

253
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,840
"After a two-headed dog
you take honey"?

254
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,800
Yeah, but I'm starting
with nothing.

255
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,920
-Um, you do know that they
hung La Buse here in Réunion?
-Yeah.

256
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,640
But they arrested him
in Madagascar.

257
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,200
And he's hardly likely
to have said,

258
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,320
"Mind if I bring this
seven-foot gold cross
and all my treasure

259
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,680
on your police boat
to the gallows" is he?

260
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,840
So it makes sense
that the treasure
is buried in Madagascar.

261
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,800
How long have you known that?

262
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,440
Since I was ten.

263
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,960
Did you not think it might
have made sense to say that?

264
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,200
I had a thought
and I've done this before
and made a fool of myself

265
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,040
by rushing in with it
before it's ready,

266
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,560
so I had to let it mature and
develop before I thought,

267
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,080
"Yes, I'll present this
thought to them."

268
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,240
I mean, there might be a
place called Two Headed Dog
in Madagascar for all I know,

269
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,640
but I wasn't looking.
I've been looking at Réunion.

270
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,520
-Well, we've got to go
to Madagascar, then.
-Yeah.

271
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
-It's not far away.
-Is it not?

272
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,320
Yeah, but we can't take
those cars to Madagascar.

273
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,640
-Why?
-Might be fun.

274
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,840
Well, no, the roads
are terrible in Madagascar.

275
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,200
How do you know?

276
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,640
Cos I had a friend when I was
much younger called Mary

277
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,120
who went there
doing wildlife conservation

278
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,240
and she told me Madagascar
was the worst place she'd
ever tried to drive a car.

279
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,120
We've been
all over the world.

280
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,960
-We've seen a lot of
potholes, mate.
-We have.

281
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,160
Yeah, but she went all over
the world as well, all over
Africa, South America.

282
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,960
She says Madagascar's
got the worst roads.

283
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,800
All she ever talked to me
about was how bad
the roads were in Madagascar

284
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,480
-and how often she was stuck.
-Right.

285
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,040
For days.

286
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,240
-Better modify our cars,
then.
-I've got a Caterham.

287
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,680
We can modify that
very easily.

288
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,120
-What, into an airship?
-I don't know.

289
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,160
Use your imagination.

290
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,720
JEREMY:
So we found a workshop.

291
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,760
And as James began...

292
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,800
Right, to work...

293
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,000
...Richard and I
went to a shop to buy kit.

294
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,760
-Bonjour.
-Bonjour.

295
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,000
Bonjour.

296
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,760
Avez-vous...

297
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,080
...jump leads, um...

298
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,720

(CONTINUES BARKING)

302
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,720
Monsieur, avez-vous
batterie connecteur?

303
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
-Ah, no.
-Oh, merci.

304
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,080
What, jump leads
are called battery...?

305
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,960
They're battery connector...
Yes, that's what it is.

306
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,800
-Not...
-You don't have any?
-You mimed it in English.

307
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,000
Well, I just thought jump
leads, brilliant acting.

308
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,880
If you know the English
for jump leads.

309
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,080
JAMES:
With the kit bought and
the modifications finished,

310
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,720
we set sail for Madagascar,

311
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:39,240
arriving two days later
in the port of Tamatave.

312
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,480
Hello again, viewers.

313
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,440
What I've done is this.

314
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,680
My car is already very light,
which is ideal
for off-roading,

315
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,320
so I've put some
bigger wheels on it.

316
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,960
That's good for ground
clearance and grip.

317
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,240
That's it.

318
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,320
Clearly, Jeremy had done
rather more than that.

319
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,720
Let me talk you through
what I've done.
There's a fair bit.

320
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,280
Got a winch here mounted
on a steel platform

321
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:31,080
and I have amour-plated steel
running from the front
to the back on the underside.

322
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,080
Headlamps, they're now
from a motorcycle.

323
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,200
I needed the space ordinarily
taken up by the lights
for these snorkels,

324
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,320
which I've fitted so the car
can now wade through
about six feet of water.

325
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,240
Moving further back,

326
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,560
big chunky tyres but the
wheels are actually smaller.

327
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,320
Now, that meant the original
brakes wouldn't fit,
had to remove those,

328
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,800
replace them with the brakes
from a Golf GTI.

329
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,080
Then I moved the brake and
fuel lines inboard to give
them extra protection

330
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,680
and removed
the air suspension,

331
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,760
replaced it, in fact,
with long travel shocks
and steel coils.

332
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,520
-You did all that
in two days?
-Well, it was that workshop.

333
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,080
-I don't know,
it was just so well-equipped.
-It was well-equipped.

334
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,640
So I was able to do, I think,
a pretty thorough job.

335
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,800
I am genuinely impressed.

336
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,880
-I'll tell you what.
-What?

337
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,320
This is what life is like...
outside the EU.

338
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,040
We were in the EU on Réunion,
smooth roads.

339
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,320
BMWs. "Would you like
a glass of Chablis?"

340
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,880
-Here...
-Yeah! Oh, sorry.

341
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,320
Would you like
some food poisoning?

342
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,680
JEREMY:
As we discussed post-Brexit
life, our colleague arrived.

343
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,920
O-K.

344
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,200
Ha-ha!

345
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,320
Yep, the flag and...?

346
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,280
And a number of
other changes.

347
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,800
OK, I'll talk you through it.
I've painted it black,
skull and crossbones.

348
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,320
There is a flag, yes.

349
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,280
Full external roll cage and
if this isn't strong enough,

350
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,400
I've replaced the front
and rear crumple zones
with girders.

351
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,800
I've raised the suspension by
19 inches to give it 23 and a
half inches ground clearance.

352
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,400
And then if you look
closely...here, the corners.

353
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,320
-Oh, yes.
-You know what he's done?

354
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,440
It's genius is
what I've done. Look at it.

355
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,160
-He's uninvented the wheel.
-You have,
you've put triangles on.

356
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,000
JEREMY: Having sorted
all that out, we got back
to the main problem.

357
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,320
The code.

358
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,280
I'm presuming, May,
because you haven't done
very much with your car,

359
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,800
you've devoted
quite a lot of time

360
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
to working out where in
Madagascar this treasure is.

361
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,480
-This non-existent treasure
is buried.
-Indeed.

362
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,320
-Yes? And where is it?
-No idea.

363
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,160
-You still don't know?
-Not a clue.

364
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,440
It's still two-headed dogs
and lemons and parrots
and things.

365
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,040
You do know they
actually arrested La Buse
on Madagascar

366
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,720
in an area called Libertalia,

367
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,080
which is like
a pirate commune
where they lived

368
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,320
and they had rules
of society and everything.

369
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,480
So it stands to reason
that's probably where
he buried his treasure

370
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,800
when they arrested him.

371
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,560
Have you known that
since you were ten as well?

372
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,320
Er, yeah, yeah, I have.

373
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,200
Is there anything else you've
known since you were ten

374
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,040
which would be relevant to us
now that you ought to
tell us?

375
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,320
No, that's it.

376
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,000
-So this Libertalia?
-Yeah.

377
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,880
-Where is it?
-North of here.

378
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,440
-How far north of here?
-100 miles.

379
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,760
You actually know
where it is?

380
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,080
Yeah, north of here.

381
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,680
100 miles north of here.

382
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,880
But you didn't say that
three days ago.

383
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,160
Again, you have to take
your time with a thought,

384
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,240
make sure it's ready,
turn it around, look at it.

385
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,040
Don't wanna make
a fool of myself, rush in.

386
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:51,040
JEREMY: And so, armed with
Captain Jack Hammond's new
information, we set off.

387
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,720
(LAUGHS)

388
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,720
I've taken
one of the finest
performance cars of its time,

389
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,560
a scalpel, and turned it
into a chainsaw.

390
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,600
(LAUGHS)

391
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,040
"Oh-arr, oh-arr, Jim lad."

392
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,360
I just don't get pirates.

393
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,600
You tell Tom Hanks
that pirates are romantic
and interesting...

394
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,160
They're not. They're
just... floating burglars.

395
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,480
Got a light here telling me
that there's a fault
with my air suspension.

396
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,840
I know, I've removed it.

397
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,400
But why had I removed it?

398
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,320
Because contrary to
what James had said,
the roads were fine.

399
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,920
Yeah.

400
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,120
Not sure I needed to raise
my car much for this
very smooth Tarmac.

401
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,440
Er, James?

402
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,880
Yes, what's your point?

403
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,840
Because of you, I've prepared
my car for Armageddon

404
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,640
and you've brought me
to a tea party.

405
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,480
JEREMY:
All right, look at this.

406
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,240
Big test for the Bentley.

407
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,160
There it is.

408
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,040
Jeez, I feel like
Ranulph Fiennes here.

409
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,200
Look at me!

410
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,000
Look at what I've done.

411
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,840
Just because he befriended
some girl in a floaty skirt,
I've ruined my whole hatch.

412
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,400
We should have known that
a friend of James' wasn't
going to be an explorer.

413
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,280
The worst thing that happened
is a daffodil fell out of her
bicycle basket and she pan...

414
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,120
"Oh, this is terribly rough.
It's absolutely awful."

415
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
(SONG PLAYING)

416
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,200
RICHARD: As we headed out
into the countryside,

417
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,680
we hoped the roads
would get worse...

418
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
But no.

419
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,400
Hello. Bonjour.

420
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,560
They're all looking at me and
thinking, "What, is he mad?"

421
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,920
Look at that lovely road.

422
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,360
What were we thinking?

423
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,120
We took off-roading advice
from Jane Austen.

424
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,400
"Oh, James,
I went to Madagascar

425
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,840
and the roads were nothing
like they are in Devon."

426
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,480
Bonjour. Please,
stop building roads!

427
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,040
-(TOOTS OF HORN)
-No more road surface.

428
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,760
Oh, God.

429
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,520
We've completely overdone
our cars.

430
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,880
They look good.

431
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,880
But they're not necessary
and nor is the journey.

432
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,720
70% of
the Madagascan population

433
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,080
exists on
less than a dollar a day.

434
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:29,920
So if there were a seven-foot
golden cross studded with
rubies buried somewhere,

435
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm fairly confident someone
would have found it by now.

436
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,080
Oh, and another thing:
buried treasure...
in all of human history,

437
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,520
not a single ounce of buried
treasure has ever been found,
ever.

438
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,040
As I complained about our
mission, the road did
suddenly get rougher.

439
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,480
Oh, yeah, that is a pothole.

440
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,280
That is a definitely
a pothole and that's
another one...Ooh.

441
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,520
O-K.

442
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,320
RICHARD: In the Ford tech...

443
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,800
I thought my mods would shine
in this new rough terrain.

444
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,720
Sadly, however...

445
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,560
Ow.

446
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,360
Slight hitch here.

447
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,360
I put my car on tracks,

448
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,880
but what I'm having trouble
with is the little wheels
inside the tracks

449
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,000
that keep...
Well, they're coming off

450
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,840
because we're driving on
a hard road

451
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,560
and these hard edges of
the potholes smash them off.

452
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,800
The simple fact is,
these tracks,
brilliant as they are,

453
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,560
are made for use on mud
and snow.

454
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,800
Off road. Not Tarmac.

455
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
(THUD)

456
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,560
RADIO: Hammo,
you've lost another one.

457
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,360
Oh, God.

458
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,320
JAMES: In the Caterham,
it wasn't just the potholes
that were annoying...

459
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,640
-(THUDS)
-Oh! Oh!

460
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,680
It was so dusty,
it felt like I was driving
in a hot Hoover bag.

461
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,960
(COUGHS) Ugh,
dust and stuff getting
in my eyes is appalling.

462
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,440
I'm gonna have to
find some goggles.

463
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,280
JEREMY: Life in the Bentley,
however, was fine.

464
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,440
I'm starting to really
like this car.

465
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,520
Now it's got a bit of mud
on it,

466
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,200
it's starting to look like
an MFB and in case
you don't know what MFB is,

467
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,840
it's what Samuel L Jackson
would call his Bentley
if he had one.

468
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,400
Properly pretty villages.

469
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,200
Melon shop.

470
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,200
Melons, melons, melons.

471
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,600
Numberplate shop.

472
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,000
That is a shop where you can
get numberplates made up.

473
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,080
Wasn't expecting that.

474
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,600
I also wasn't expecting to
find an agreeable
seaside hotel,

475
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:03,440
where, a bit later,
a dusty and grimy May chose
not to join me for lunch.

476
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,920
Great.

477
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,120
Now the pool's
got a muddy dog in it.

478
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,120
RICHARD: I, meanwhile,
was starting to worry
that in this heat on Tarmac,

479
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,400
my little plastic wheels
would be starting to warp.

480
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,040
So when I got to the hotel,
I also didn't join Jeremy
for lunch.

481
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,560
I need to find a way
of cooling them.

482
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,280
Build a cooling system
out here with nothing.

483
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:48,240
And what I do in situations
like this is think to myself,
"What would Bear Grylls do?"

484
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,840
Having scoured the shoreline
for nature's raw materials,
I set to work.

485
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,280
Well, fingers crossed.

486
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,880
Here's what I've done.

487
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,720
Luckily I've found these
completely full office
water cooler bottles

488
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,440
that had been washed up.

489
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,000
Along with this nylon rope
that had also been washed up.

490
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,400
And along with them
I found these lengths
of clear hose.

491
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,000
I've attached them
to the car,

492
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,200
some cable ties
had washed up.

493
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,640
And down here at the bottom
it can deliver a life-saving
trickle of cooling water.

494
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,800
It may not look pretty
but it'll work.

495
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,040
And as
Bear Grylls himself says,

496
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,320
"Improvise, adapt, survive."

497
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,520
JEREMY: Sadly,
Hammond's modifications
had taken so long,

498
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,640
it was too late in the day
to move on.

499
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,960
And anyway,
May was busy carpet-bombing
the code with his OCD.

500
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,600
Here's something very
interesting I learned today.

501
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,560
I was next to a shop watching
a man count his water melons

502
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,320
and we would count one, two,

503
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,880
three, four, five like that.

504
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,760
But he was going one,
two, three, four, five,

505
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,400
which is exactly
what appears on there.

506
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,480
So that might be a letter
but it might be two.

507
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:12,120
Some of those symbols might
be numbers, they might be
compass bearings,

508
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,000
they might be numbers
of paces from a tree,
something like that.

509
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,200
Some of the bits
that appear to be
gibberish...

510
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,360
JEREMY: The next day,
as the sun rose on this
little-known paradise,

511
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,360
we were back on the move.

512
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,760
So, May,
have you cracked the code?

513
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,920
Nope.

514
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,520
Predictable.

515
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,440
RICHARD: Still, at least my
cooling system was working.

516
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,920
Water delivered, life saved.

517
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000

(LAUGHS) My car is amusing.

521
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,600
Clearly, though,
it was the MFB that was
causing more of a stir.

522
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,520
(LAUGHS)

523
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,400
Then we came across something
that wasn't so cheerful.

525
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,360

That woman is in the stocks.

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,200
She's actually got
wooden handcuffs on.

528
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,800
RICHARD: Chaps, this Tarmac
road has finally run out.

529
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,960
But it's kind of run out
completely.

530
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,400
-What do you mean?
-There's no road at all.

531
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,320
This looks like a ferry.

532
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,160
Once on board,
I noticed Jeremy had got
himself a new number plate.

533
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,800
I just can't work it out,
"MFB".

Hang on.

537
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,640
JEREMY: When the ferry
docked on the other bank...

538
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,320
...it was like we'd gone
back 200 years.

JEREMY: Bloody hell!

541
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,040
Yeah, this is quite bad now,
I'll admit.

RICHARD: Swim, swim, swim.

543
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,320
JEREMY: Finally,
the modifications
we'd made to our cars

544
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,360
were coming into their own.

545
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,400
The MFB is through!

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,160
This is what I built
my car for.

Tracks won't be getting
too hot. I'm cooling them
in the water.

JEREMY: How's it going
in the Sherman?

551
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,000
RICHARD: Honestly,
it's a walk in the park.
What about you?

552
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,360
It's a bit squeaky.
But it keeps going.

553

is what's happening

Oh, shitty death.

00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,440
I'll just adjust the
temperature down to...

565
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,800
22 degrees, I think,
would be better.

572
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,520
JEREMY: Luckily for Hammond,
we were running alongside
a beach.

573
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,600
So I suggested
we use that instead.

574
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,160
Have we finally found
a terrain where
those tracks work?

575

00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,640

To cheer Hammond up,

592
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,800
I decided to give him
a small present.

593
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,840
You've got a number plate
as well.

594
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,600
-"Fury" as in Fury?
-As in the tank.

595
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,640
-For my car? That is--
-Yes.

596
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,800
-So you can put "Fury" on it.
-Oh, I say!

597
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,600
-It doesn't actually mean
that here, exactly.
-What's it mean here?

598
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,840
Well, the Ygrec, the Y,
means "lady parts".

599
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,440
So what that actually says is
"Furry lady parts."

600
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,440
But, for you,
it means "fury".

601
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,760
You're Brad Pitt in a tank -
pirate tank.

602
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,760

Look at the state of you.
Have you had a trouser
accident?

604
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,400
I was actually underwater
at one point.

a disgusting place to sit.

606

How did you do that?

609
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,640
It took me a lot of attempts
cos I wanted to do that.

eternity watching Brad Pitt
do his repairs,

611
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,560
we finally got back
on the move.

612
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,440
I wonder why Formula 1 teams
don't use tracks, Hammond,

613
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,920
if you can change them
in just three hours?

crossing,

-Yeah, I would.

If somebody said to me,
"Yes, there are sharks
in there,"

623

I'd still say,
"I don't care."

It's on!

and cleaner.

We thought at this point the
road couldn't get any worse.

632
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,640
And then...it did.

633
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,640
Right, so this terrain now
is soft sand.

I wasn't.

Chaps, are you interested
in treasure or not?

667
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,960
£100 million worth,
available this way.

668
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,320
How far is this place?

669
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,160
We don't know. Libertalia -
it doesn't exist, anyway.

670
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,160
-It does exist.
-It doesn't exist!

671
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,200
Well, it did.
They wrote about it.

672
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,560
Well, they wrote about
Narnia.
Doesn't mean it existed.

673
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,640
We continued our journey
on what is genuinely

674
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,800
Madagascar's equivalent
of the M1.

675
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,600
Oh, Christ!

676
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,640
Can't see a thing.

677
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,640
May can't be doing this
with only two-wheel drive,
it's not possible.

678
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,360
JAMES: But thanks
to its lightness,

679
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,360
the plucky little Caterham
was ploughing on.

680
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,560
Mind the grit. There it is.

681
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,320
Bonjour.

682
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,080
It was Hammond, though,
who had the most reason
to celebrate.

683
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
RICHARD: Finally, we've
found what it's good at.

684
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,320
(CACKLES)

685
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,040
This thing is unstoppable!

686
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,440
(HEAVY THUD)

687
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,960
Oh, my giddy aunt.

688
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,440
It looks like a wheelchair
that's fallen down
a flight of stairs.

689
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,000
Yeah, it's bad.

690
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,640
OK.

691
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,400
What would you like me
to do about that?

692
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,160
What are you in a position
to do about that?

693
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,840
JEREMY: Having thought
about it for a long time,

694
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,640
I decided the answer
was nothing.

695
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,040
So I left him to it...

696
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,320
This is the tensioner
assembly that sits
at the back of the track.

697
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,120
...and set off with James
into the night.

698
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,640
JAMES:
Oh, it's getting worse.

699
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,280
(HEAVY THUD)

700
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,600
Ohh, (BLEEP) me,
that was uncomfortable!

701
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,520
We were only 40 miles
from Libertalia,

702
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,880
this place that only exists
in Richard Hammond's
colouring-in books.

703
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,640
So we figured we'd just keep
on taking the punishment.

704
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,080
If you've just joined us,
James May is covered
in human excrement.

705
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,120
From behind,
your hair looks...

706
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,080
It's like
Trevor McDonald's hair.

707
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,920
It is actually a single
entity. It's a new type
of molecule.

708
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,960
(LAUGHS)

709
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,440
Would you like me
to give you a little push?

710
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,560
JAMES: Yeah, try it,
a little nudge.

711
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,160
Here I come. I shall try
to be gentle, James May.

712
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,280
(HEAVY THUD)

713
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,360
-(ENGINE REVVING)
-Oh, thanks!

714
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,920
JAMES: Jeremy and I
battled on for another
two brutal hours...

715
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,160
Please make it stop.

716
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,600
Just stop.

717
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,520
...until we arrived at
another ferry crossing.

718
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,040
Sadly, however...

719
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,600
Everything was as bad
as it could possibly be

720
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,160
and now it's worse.

721
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,160
The ferry's engine's broken.

722
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,200
But they have said that James
and I can pull it across.

723
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,960
I mean...

724
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,920
They obviously looked at us
and thought,
"Yeah, they're athletes."

725
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,640
-Oh, this is a nice rope.
-(GRUNTS) Isn't it?

726
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,880
God, heave!

727
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,520
Agh. Oh, my back!

728
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,320
(GROANS)

729
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,440
JAMES: As we pulled ourselves
along, I suddenly had
a thought about Hammond.

730
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,920
-If we go over there
and get off...
-Yeah?

731
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,920
...it's not gonna be on the
right side when he arrives.

732
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,840
Yeah, but that's
not our problem.

733
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,680
You're absolutely right
it isn't.

734
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,960
RICHARD: Several miles back,
having bodged a repair,

735
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,000
I was now back in the game.

736
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,560
Gingerly does not cover...

737
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,920
...how carefully
I'm driving this thing.

738
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,040
-(THUD)
-Ohh. Rock in there.

739
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,120
(CLATTERING)

740
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,160
It feels like it's tearing
itself to pieces.

741
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,680
JEREMY:
After 16 hours on the move,

742
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,280
James and I still had
a steely determination

743
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,880
to keep going
to journey's end.

744
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,560
Our willpower
was bulletproof.

745
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,880
We would not be distracted
from the job in hand.

746
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,360
Oh, a hotel. Hotel, look.

747
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,400
JAMES: Does it say "bar"?

748
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,000
"Hotel restaurant open."

749
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,480
That'll do.

750
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,560
Oh, my God.

751
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,360
That is deep.

752
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,800
Back in my world,
things were getting worse.

753
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,360
One of the crew cars had
provided a stark reminder

754
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,480
of what could happen
if you strayed even
slightly off the track.

755
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,120
-Oh! That's grim.
-(HEAVY THUD)

756
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,640
Oh.

757
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:12,640
And on top of that,
my car felt like it
was disintegrating.

758
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,120
-(RATTLING)
-That rattling noise.

759
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,200
Is that the bearing
on that side?

760
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,240
Oh! Oh, Lord.

761
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:26,640
Consequently, my nerves
were shot when, at three
in the morning...

762
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,680
I arrived at
the river crossing...

763
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,720
...to find the ferry
was on the other bank.

764
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,360
Oh, the (BLEEP) bastards!

765
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,800
-Oh!
-(CLATTERING)

766
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,440
I would therefore have
to row over to get it back.

767
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,120
This is shit!

768
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,160
Everything's shit!

769
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,360
And this (BLEEP) canoe
doesn't work!

770
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,960
(GRUNTS)

771
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,400
JEREMY: The next morning,
Richard Hammond was in
a bit of a mood.

772
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,320
Was it difficult?

773
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,560
JEREMY: I, on the other hand,
was very happy.

774
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,440
Because,
after a refreshing shave,

775
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,520
I noticed there was a marked
difference between my living
conditions in the Bentley...

776
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,680
Showroom fresh.

777
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760
...and May's in the Caterham.

778
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,680
Your car looks like
Teddy Kennedy's car
after Chappaquiddick.

779
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,720
(HAIR TRIMMER BUZZES)

780
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,960
As I went back to my
grooming, the sulky Brummie
finally spoke.

781
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,880
I don't particularly want
to talk to either of you.

782
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,760
But here's to explain why
there may be another
opportunity to abandon me.

783
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,360
-You know I've got problems
at the front end?
-Yes.

784
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,760
I have significant problems
at the back.

785
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,720
Both of the rear
trailing arms are snapped.

786
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,040
Snapped?

787
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,400
Gone, broken.

788
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,360
JAMES:
It's well thought out, this.

789
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,080
Which means at any point,

790
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,040
the whole back end of my car
could collapse inward,

791
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,080
possibly firing one of these
under the car and throwing it
on its roof.

792
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,240
In fairness, we won't see
that cos we'll be at least
20 miles ahead.

793
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,880
(SNIGGERING)

794
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,680
I'd love to offer you a lift.

795
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,360
I only give lifts to people
who haven't pulled my battery
isolator switch out.

796
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,120
I'm very tempted to pull your
battery isolator switch off
your car and swallow it.

797
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,440
And then give it back to you
probably in ten minutes'
time.

798
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,520
You think I'd notice
on that car?

799
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,280
JEREMY: Mercifully,
the road that morning
was much smoother.

800
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,320
And we were surrounded
by Madagascar

801
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,040
at its absolute vibrant best.

802
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,440
I'm not really looking where
I'm going cos of that view.

803
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,880
That's green.

804
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,920
We don't have anything
that green in Europe.
Look at it.

805
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,800
Soon we arrived
at a much bigger ferry

806
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,960
that would take us on
a short hop up the coast.

807
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,840
JAMES: Slightly more
impressive boat
than last night.

808
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,920
This one appears
to have an engine.

809
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,560
-And be here.
-Ooh!

810
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,720
JEREMY: When we reached
our destination, however,
there was a problem.

811
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,720
(CLANKING)

812
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,600
Argh.

813
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,160
There was no way of driving
off the beach where we landed

814
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,240
until low tide.

815
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:12,240
So to kill the time, James
went back to codebreaking.

816
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:20,160
Hammond and I, meanwhile,
realised that in conditions
as harsh as these...

817
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,240
...survival would be tough.

818
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,600
We'd need food.

819
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:31,000
So he began with
a Bear Grylls hostile
environment classic -

820
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,440
the improvised beach oven.

821
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,800
When you've finished
digging your pit,

822
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,600
line it with some of
the rocks, about half.

823
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,240
And I'm gonna light a fire
on top of these rocks.

824
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,080
I could light a fire in any
one of a number of ways -

825
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,440
a piece of broken glass
from the sea, focused light
from the sun onto a leaf...

826
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,320
I'm gonna ask the crew
for a lighter.

827
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,360
There. It's working.

828
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,160
As Bear Grylls says,
three words in survival.

829
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,720
First-class travel and
five-star accommodation
or I won't do it.

830
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,520
JEREMY: The second basic
principle of survival is
hydration.

831
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,040
So I set about
finding fluids.

832
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,880
A lot of survivalists
will tell you...

833
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,720
that when you're thirsty, you
should drink your own piss.

834
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,760
But I say no to that.
I say...

835
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,800
Go into the jungle
and find fruit.

836
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,640
And drink that instead.

837
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,040
It tastes nicer
and it does you more good.

838
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,720
Look.

839
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,400
Coconuts.

840
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,440
This is a rotten one
that's fallen down.

841
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,160
I'm gonna try and get a fresh
one by throwing this at it.

842
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,000
Right, my rocks are hot.

843
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,880
Which means
we're ready to get cooking.

844
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,760
So, take your fish
that you caught earlier -

845
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,960
that bit's not difficult,
that's the sea.

846
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,920
You wrap the fish in leaves.

847
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,680
Tie it off and now transfer
the fish to your beach oven.

848
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,760
(WINCES) Hot, hot!

849
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,800
Bury the fish,

850
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,800
to contain all that heat
in our oven
that we built earlier.

851
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,320
Two hours from now,
that is gonna be...

852
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,680
...a cooked fish.

853
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,360
JEREMY: Having finally
hit a coconut...

854
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,800
Yes! Ho-ho-ho! Yes!

855
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,880
...I went in search
of bananas.

856
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,600
Oh, yeah. Yes, yes, yes.

857
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,400
Shit!

858
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,640
OK.

859
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,520
And eventually, our survival
rations came together.

860
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,080
-Banana daiquiri.
-Really?

861
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,400
Yeah, banana,
coconut milk and rum.

862
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,920
Fantastic! Where did you
get the rum from?

863
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,480
-Back of the Bentley.
-Oh, clever!

864
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,080
JEREMY: Mm.

865
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,000
You can survive surprisingly
well with a Bentley.

866
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,280
-This is very good,
by the way.
-Thank you.

867
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,280
I've said it before.
Just because
it's a survival situation,

868
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,280
doesn't mean
we have to eat like animals.

869
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,880
Standards.

870
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,400
That's not bad.

871
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,360
It's very good, well done.
That is survival.

872
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,520
JEREMY: Back on the boat,
there was more joy.

873
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,320
James was actually
getting somewhere.

874
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,200
Where are we?

875
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,480
Yes!

876
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,160
Yes, yes, yes!

877
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,560
Ohh.

878
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:32,400
What I've found is the name
of the place where the
treasure must be buried.

879
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,000
And it's on the map.
Let me tell you how I did it.

880
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,120
It's incredible.

881
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,160
La Buse was a pirate.
Two things:

882
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:43,520
he wouldn't write this and
tell you where the treasure
was in the first line.

883
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,640
He's gonna play with your
mind and tell you down here
somewhere.

884
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,000
So I started
down in the last four lines,

885
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,160
I thought, "That's
where it's gonna be."

886
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,320
And then I discovered a name
that was as clear as day.

887
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,400
And I thought, "That sounds
like the name of a place."

888
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,200
Seranambe - and there it is.

889
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,840
Look, it's very small.

890
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,400
Can you see it? I've
scribbled on it in my
excitement. Seranambe.

891
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,280
That's where it is.

892
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,840
All we have to do now is work
out where in Seranambe
to dig.

893
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,680
That's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

894
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,320
JEREMY: So James
had cracked the code

895
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,160
and Hammond and I had
learned an important lesson

896
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:28,560
about surviving on nothing
but poached fish and several
banana daiquiris.

897
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,160
Remember...

898
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,600
adapt.

899
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,400
-You've forgotten.
-Improvise, yes.

900
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,680
-(LAUGHS)
-Improvise. I've remembered.

901
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,640
-Adopt.
-No.

902
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,320
Adapt.

903
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,400
-Improvise.
-Survive.

904
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,440
That's what we're gonna do.

905
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,480
RICHARD: The next day,
with the daiquiris out of
our system,

906
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:59,560
we drove off the beach to
find we were in Libertalia.

907
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,880
And tantalisingly close
to the village James
had identified.

908
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,920
We know where we're going.

909
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,080
And it's 15 miles away.

910
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,440
In 45 minutes, we will be
deep in pirate country,
digging for treasure.

911
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,120
We'll get there. You two go
and establish there's no
golden crucifix with rubies

912
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,000
and I'll find a dribble
of wi-fi and book
some flights home.

913
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,000
If you want to rule yourself
out of mind-blowing wealth,
fine.

914
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,080
There won't be any wealth.

915
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,640
You're in for a terrible
disappointment.

916
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,080
I'm in pirate country,
that's what I'm in.

917
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,720
(LAUGHTER)

918
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,080
You're all right.

919
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,160
James, you're
not even looking!

920
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:59,000
JEREMY: I had to admit
one thing about this
so-called Libertalia.

921
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,040
It wasn't bad-looking.

922
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,560
If pirates were here,
and it's possible...

923
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,600
They were here.

924
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,200
-I can see why
they'd choose it.
-It's gorgeous.

-Bristol.
-Southampton...

928
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,760
and then you go to Calais,

929
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,840
you'd go, "Do you know..."

930
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,680
Yeah, it's all right,
isn't it?

931
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,320
"I'll do some pirating here."

932
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:31,000
JEREMY: Everything is just
ridiculously perfect.

933
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,960
RICHARD: That was
a blissful interlude, that.

934
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,040
Travelling silently across...

935
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,080
No Ford key. Oh, no.

936
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,520
No, he hasn't?

937
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,400
He bloody has.

938
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,240
James May, have you done
what I think you've done?

939
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,280
He's taken the key.

940
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,080

941
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,880
Damn it!

942
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,440
James!
Give me my key fob.

943
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,520
It's like a little magic
trick. You've got to find it
in the shop.

944

-You utter--
-It's in the shop.

to look for his keys...

Why are we playing
parlour games now?

949
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:16,040

short drive to the imaginary

Gaargh,
that is a horrible noise!

1006
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,400
JEREMY:
I think this is impossible.

1007
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,920
I mean, we need some blasting
equipment to get through
here.

If you come round this way,
you can see from down here,

1009

there's no way in hell you
can get a Bentley up that.

1010
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,600
Sadly, James and I didn't
have any blasting equipment.

1011
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,120
So we had to do
something radical.

1012
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,720
Work together.

JEREMY: As we were
struggling with the terrain,

1017
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:29,360
our colleague was having to
deal, in bad French, with his
held-up wedding party.

1018

Maintenant, je...aller...

1020
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,320
Je vais... And you can do
the same. Sorry.

1021
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,160
To speed things up,
I decided to ditch the tracks

1022
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,560
and put the focus
back on wheels.

1023
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,320
And because they wanted
to get to the church on time,

1024
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,320
the groom and his mates
were more than happy to help.

1025
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,920

was the two-wheel-drive

Get up there, car.
Come on. Go on.

Is that wheel up in the air?

1035
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,240
Jesus, it did it.

1036
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,160
Did you see that?
It did it.

1037
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,040
This is a track car.
It's a racing car.

remind you of that?

I'd held up the wedding

But, by using calmness
and patience...

1041

to get the wheels on...

Merci.

everyone's way...

on the move.

JEREMY: Up ahead, the road's
surface hadn't changed,

1053
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,080
but it had got narrower.

1054
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:57,360
So I had to use an ingenious
traffic management solution

who's going to run
ahead of us

1060
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,200
to stop cars coming
the other way.

1061
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,800
What does he do if there are
cars coming the other way?

1062
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,200
He stops them in a place where
we can get past, you mean?

1063
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,400
Exactly.

1064
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,360
He organises cars
to meet at the right place.

Yes, what...
This is a service I like.

01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,160
I'd been on the go
for ten hours

1102

I decided to stop
and grab something to eat.

1104

We've been given these
emergency ration packs.

1105
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,960
So, what I do is,
take the top off there

1106
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:39,280
and that's the food
which is, I don't know,
beans and sausages.

1107
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,760
That goes in there.

1108
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,480
And then I add
a little drop of water.

1109
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:49,040
I presume this triggers some
sort of chemical reaction

1110
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,720
with whatever it is
in the little bag of stuff.

1111

haven't got a spare one.

This was the first time ever

1166
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,400
we'd lost a car
on one of our adventures.

1167
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,360
But, there was no time
to mourn

1168
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,640
because as the sun rose
the next morning,

1169
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,720
we were on the road early,

1170
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:18,160
eager to cover the last
few miles to James's village.

1171
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,320
I like walking,
but in the Lake District.

01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,440
All right, mate.

1174
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,600
Have you seen how well
my car does this stuff?

1175
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,040
JEREMY:
Once again, Running Boy
was out doing his thing.

1176
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,160
-Oh, look at this.
-(HE LAUGHS)

1177
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,040
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1178
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,880
Merci bien. Merci.

1179
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,840
And, once again, Captain
Stubborn hadn't paid him.

(HORN HONKING)

1181
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,320
Can you back up a bit?

1182
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:00,920
No, no, no, no.
If you just back up a bit.

1183
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,040
JAMES: Oi!

1184
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,560
Oi!

1185
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,000
-(THUD)
-Oh!

1186
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:17,000
JEREMY: Then,
as we inched our way along,

1187
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,520
the big bruiser
finally stumbled.

1188
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,520
Uh, temperature gauge
is climbing, climbing.

1189
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,640
It's now in the red.
I'm gonna have to stop.

1190

(HISSING)

1191
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,880
The trouble is,
there are eight radiators
in this thing.

1192
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,920
I can't even see.
I can't get at anything.

1193
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,960
JAMES: While my colleague
tried to fix his engine
by staring at it,

1194
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:52,080
I was arriving
at our destination,

1195
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:54,320
the village of Seranambe...

1196
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,080
(CHATTER AND LAUGHTER)

1197
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,000
Hello.

1198
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:04,040
...where I'd crack
the last part of the code

1199
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,080
and find the treasure.

1200
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,560
In the cryptogram,
there is an X.

1201
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,320
It's obviously not
"X marks the spot".

1202
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:13,960
That would be too obvious.

1203
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,840
And, after it,
there are distances, which
I'm gonna assume are paces,

1204
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,960
not miles or kilometres
or anything like that.

1205
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,920
But I don't know what the...

1206
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,680
I don't know
what the X means.

1207
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,600
I mean, if he's talking
about buildings,
they'll have all gone.

1208
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,080
The trees will
all be different.

1209
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:29,440
Only geographical features
will be the same

1210
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,680
and this is just flat.

1211
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:37,000
JEREMY: Back at the Bentley,
the news was not good.

1212
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:41,120
I removed the entire front
of the car and I found this.

1213
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,840
It's a part of
the cooling system

1214
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,360
and the end's come off.

1215
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,240
The fact of the matter
is this.

1216
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,920
If I can't get
that hose repaired,

1217
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,040
it's game over for the MFB.

1218
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,880
JAMES:
By contrast, in the village,
things were looking up.

1219
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,200
Wait a minute.

1220
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,800
No, wait a minute.

1221
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,560
It's the church.

1222
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,520
Churches are always built on
the same spot, aren't they?

1223
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:17,080
So the "X" is actually
a badly-drawn cross.

1224
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:21,800
So from X, the crucifix,
it turns out, that's there,

1225
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:26,200
north, that'll be
magnetic north, 120 paces,

1226
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,840
that's where the treasure is.

1227
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,720
After I'd found the spot...

1228
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:35,000
117, 118, 119, 120. There.

1229
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,720
...Hammond arrived.

1230
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,200
So we broke out the shovels
and he started to dig.

1231
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,560
-So where do you think he is?
-Who?

1232
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,400
Jeremy.

1233
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:49,200
Well, he was behind me about
two kilometres up the hill

1234
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,920
-outside the town.
-Yeah.

1235
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,560
And then I sort of lost
radio contact with him.

1236
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,360
And I haven't heard
from him since.

1237
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,720
-(RATCHET CLICKING)
-This isn't...

1238
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,600
Oh, this is never gonna work.

1239
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,360
No, the end's come off.
The end's come off that now.

1240
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:09,040
Why doesn't it...?
Why is everything breaking?

1241
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,680
Oh, God-all-bloody-mighty.

1242
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,600
JAMES: there are two reasons
why we don't need him.
-Yeah?

1243
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,720
-One is, he doesn't believe
in buried treasure.
-Yeah.

1244
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,120
And the other is, he's not
gonna do any digging, is he?

1245
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:25,160
And the other is,
treasure goes a lot further
split two ways.

1246
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,400
-Exactly.
-It's 50 million each.

1247
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,200
It's 49 and a half million.
We'll have to leave
a bit for the crew.

1248
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,960
JEREMY:
Sadly for James and Richard,

1249
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:39,320
two hours later, they were
back to a three-way split.

1250
01:12:54,400 --> 01:13:00,120
What in the name of all
that's holy is going on here?

1251
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,960
-It's not here, is it?
JAMES: How do you know?

1252
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,680
-Because it isn't here.
-It's not here yet.

1253
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,360
We'd have found it by now.
They didn't build
the Channel Tunnel, did they?

1254
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,560
-Ahem.
-RICHARD: Oh, hello.

1255
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,760
JAMES: Where the bloody
hell have you been?

1256
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,440
I have been giving myself
dirty fingernails.

1257
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,320
-Oh, dear.
-Why?

1258
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:22,720
Well, I've been fitting my
bonnet with the Madagascar
pack, but never mind that.

1259
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,680
Why have you two dug a hole

1260
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,160
in the middle of this pretty
little town's football pitch?

1261
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,920
Because this is where
the treasure is.

1262
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,080
-Is the treasure buried here?
-No.

1263
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:35,280
Right, well,
on that terrible,

1264
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,280
but entirely predictable
disappointment,
it's time to...

1265
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,960
-Um, actually...
-It's not time to end,
apparently. Why? What?

1266
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,720
You know
that island down there?
We passed it yesterday.

1267
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,200
Yeah?

1268
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,920
Did you know it's actually
called Pirate Island?

1269
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,040
And it makes sense,
if you think about it,

1270
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,760
that he wouldn't have hid
the treasure on Madagascar,
where it could be found.

1271
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,320
He'd have hidden it in secret
on Pirate Island.

1272
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,120
So, that's probably where
it is, innit? Think about it.

1273
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,880
How long have you known

1274
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,760
that that island
was called Pirate Island?

1275
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,880
(EXHALES) Always.

the village football team
might be a bit annoyed,

1277
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:29,280

to get out of town, fast.

Your man is taking beer
off the boat.

1283
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,400
The beer is supposed
to go on the boat.

1284
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:00,400
JEREMY: Whilst Roger the
Cabin Boy and Seaman Staines
got ready to sail,

1285
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:05,280
I paid Running Boy,
gave him some new shoes...

1286
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:06,960
Yes? Bon?

1287
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:12,080
...and then rushed
to the boat myself.

1288
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,920
RICHARD: Finally.

1289
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,280
Oh, good, they've ruined
the football pitch and now
they've ruined the beach.

1290
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,040
Is this the same boat
we used the other day?

1291
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,200
Yes, I've chartered it,
it's ours.

With the entire crew
loaded on board,
and May's booze lorries,

1293
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,400
I decided
to give him a present

1294
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:35,840
appropriate for someone
who'd just ruined the town's
only sports venue.

1295
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,720
It's a number plate
and it's magic, OK?

1296
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,800
JAMES: Is it?
-No, it is, it's magic.

1297
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,560
To the ladies and gentlemen
at home, it's pixilated.

1298
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,280
It's only visible
to the naked eye.

1299
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,160
RICHARD: Ooh, that's
quite a strong message.

1300
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,920
I mean, obviously you can't
read it, because as I say,
it's magic.

1301
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
We can see exactly
what it says and it...

1302
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,760
That's when it's stationary.
Does it still work
if it moves?

1303
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,040
Let's test how good it is
as magic.

at what we'd achieved.

In less than a week,

01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:11,320
we have managed to cover
a staggering 139 miles.

Well, two of our cars
are still running.

01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:30,600
I'll tell you what driving
the Bentley's like off road.

1335
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,360
It's just this sense
of immenseness.

1336
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:37,400
It's like being at the birth
of a world in there.

1337
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,280
There's a sense of
enormous power going on.

1338
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,080
Of biblical happenings.

1339
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:45,680
Whereas yours is just this
little insect hopping about.
Or a goat.

1340
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,360
No, I'll tell you
what mine is like.

1341
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,960
What it's like
being in the Caterham.

1342
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:53,640
It's like being invited to
the football World Cup final

1343
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:55,960
and they've given you
a special seat

1344
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,200
and it's inside the ball.

1345
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,680
(LAUGHS WHEEZILY)

1346
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:03,000
I'd rather be
at the birth of a world.

1347
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,240
In control of
the birth of a world.

1348
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:08,640
You are not in control,
you're just inside a football
being kicked about.

1349
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,960
Whereas I am in control.

1350
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,600
Right, we're gonna have
a continent here

1351
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:14,400
and we'll have
some tides on the moon.

1352
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,720
You know, we'll get
that going around,
it'll be fantastic.

1353
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,280
And then we'll have
some tectonic plates.

1354
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,440
That's not really
what happens
at the birth of a world.

1355
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,880
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

1356
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:23,280
Somebody doesn't
sit there planning it.

1357
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:28,320
But the fact is, your car,
it is disgusting, James.

1358
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:31,400
I can see germs
coming out of it.

1359
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:35,720
When you drove through
a lake of human effluent,
you were covered in it.

1360
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,120
When I drove through
the human effluent,

1361
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,520
my front window
went a bit brown momentarily

1362
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,560
and then that was
the end of that.

1363
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,840
I was back to my
air-conditioned splendour.

1364
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,840
-That's why mine's better.
-Your car's not better.

1365
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,840
I've got a spotless shirt on.

1366
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,720
-But that's not
the objective.
-Yes, it is.

1367
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,440
The objective
is not to be spotless,

1368
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:56,000
it is to find treasure
in Madagascar.

1369
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,920
-There isn't any treasure.
-You don't know that.

1370
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,120
-I do know that. OK.
-How do you know that?

01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:08,000
I used to do this as a kid,
but that'd be my teacher
on the plank.

1373
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,880
Now there's someone
even better.

1374

JEREMY: Soon Pirate Island
hoved into view

1377
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,600
and we prepared to disembark.

1378
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:28,560

Where are my shoes?

1380
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:45,840
JEREMY: Having reached land,
James and I experienced
a strange sensation.

1381
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:50,360
Holy mother of God,
it's a road!

1382
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:54,200
Nice, isn't it?
It's like coming back inside
and standing on the carpet.

1383
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:58,160
Along with the Tarmac,
there was also
a mobile phone signal,

1384
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:02,160
electricity and many shops.

1385
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,960
That is an actual restaurant.

1386
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:08,200
James and Richard
could go and dig a big hole

1387
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,960
in the kitchen of
the restaurant, perhaps.

1388
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,000
Put him out of business.

1389
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,320
Why would you not do that?

1391
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,160

1393
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,960
Yep, I've ended up
in a tuk tuk

1394
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,840
but it's no ordinary tuk tuk.
It's got a pirate on it.

-Oh, yes.

1396
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,840
It's a great ride as well.

1397
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:38,600
As Hammond bought
stupid souvenirs...

1398
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,840
It's a bit more "Arr",
a bit more piratey.

1399
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:43,520
...I found a hotel

1400
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,240
so May could get back
to code cracking.

1401

And in the morning,
we set off with James

01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:00,920

laughing at his car...

(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

1405
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,160
Now, I had a bit of
a breakthrough
last night, viewers.

1406
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,400
The cryptograph,
La Buse's cryptograph,

1407
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,920
mentions a Turkish dog,

1408
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,320
which doesn't actually mean
a dog from Turkey.

1409
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,680
It means a dog with no hair.

1410
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,760
And when I looked at
the map of the island,

1411
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:26,120
I realised it looks like
a hairless dog.

1412
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:29,920
And its ear is a beach.
A very distinct beach.

1413
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,040
That's where we're going.
That's where I think
the crucifix is buried.

1414
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,520
I'm absolutely
convinced of it.

1415
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:40,160
JEREMY: Soon we arrived at
the completely deserted beach

1416
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:43,200
which looked nothing
like a dog's ear,

1417
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:48,280
and immediately
my deluded colleagues
started to talk gibberish.

1418
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,120
-So, is this it?
-Yeah, this is it.

1419
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,160
-This is where it is?
-And it makes perfect sense,
actually.

1420
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:54,720
-If you're in a cartoon.
-No.

1421
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,800
If you're fleeing from
the Royal Navy

1422
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,040
and you unload the treasure
and you quickly bury it
before they get to you.

1423
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,960
The obvious place to bury it
is on the beach,
cos it's easy to dig.

1424
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,160
So we could right now
be standing on it?

1425
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,280
-You could be.
-It could be under our feet.

1426
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,800
But it could be over there.
This is quite a big crescent,

1427
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:12,560
so I would suggest
we divide it up into three,

1428
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:14,200
make sure
we don't miss any of it.

1429
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:16,360
-So, Hammond,
you take that third.
-Gladly.

1430
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,840
I'll go in the middle.
You go down the far end.

1431
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:22,520
Right. Come on, lads.
We've come a long way to do
this, let's get to work.

Since we were looking for
a 220-pound gold cross,

1433
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:34,560
the best tool for the job
was clearly a metal detector.

1434
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:37,000
I should check it works.

1435
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:39,920
See if it can find
my Swiss hill climb knee.

-(BEEPING AND SQUEALING)
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1437
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,440
Wooh.

1438
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,600
Yep, it definitely works.

1439
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,160
It is possible that when
I find it, it'll be grizzly,

1440
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,680
because pirates used to,

1441
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:54,600
when they buried
their treasure,

1442
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:57,840
bury a prisoner
on top of it...

1443
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,640
...so the ghost
would protect the treasure.

1444

JAMES: Meanwhile,
and as you'd expect,

1445
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,640
I was doing things properly.

1446
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,040
It's gonna take a long time
to do this beach,

1447
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,040
so I'm gonna assemble
four metal detectors

1448
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,760
on this rudimentary trailer
that I've put together,

1449
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:18,680
and then I can detect four
times as much beach in one
pass and I can use the car.

JEREMY: Given that we'd be
conducting this fools' errand
in the blazing heat,

would be better spent

The great thing about this,
of course,

1458
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,600
is that my wheel tracks
will show me which bits
I've already done.

1459
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,800
It's a bit like
ploughing a field.

-It's a bar.
-Oh, I'm sorry!

01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:18,120
I'm sorry that
the bar-shaped shelter

1475

doesn't meet with

daiquiri, it's excellent.
-Thank you.

a bit of effort to help us

Which is to find
the Fiery Cross of Goa,

a seven-foot high golden
crucifix studded with rubies.

Shall I tell you exactly
where that is?

-Hey, no, it isn't.

And, listen, it was real.
We know that.

1485
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:45,000
The French government
offered La Buse

1486
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:46,880
a pardon for his piracy

1487
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,640
if he'd go back to France

1488
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,840
and hand over
the fiery cross, and he...

1489

Wait a minute.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1490
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:53,920
The French government
did what?

1491
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,560
The French government said,
"We'll give you, La Buse,
an amnesty as a pirate

if you'll bring specifically
the fiery cross
back to France."

01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:09,240
These are cross-referenced
primary source pieces
of academic research.

1496
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:12,640
We know it existed
and the evidence says
it's on this beach.

1497
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:15,360
No pirate treasure...
You will agree with this.

1498
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:18,600
No pirate treasure
has ever been found,
buried pirate treasure.

1499
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:20,520
No, that's because
it's still lost.

1500
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,320
Tutankhamun hadn't been found
for thousands of years.

1501
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,320
-And then it was.
-Exactly.

1502
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:30,600
There's a chance, then,
if I go down there,
I find this cross?

1503
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:32,320
-There's a chance?
-Yes.

1504
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:34,920
If I do a quick search, can I
come back to my shelter?

1505
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,040
-Not too quick.
-You got to thorough search.

1506
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,560
We've divided the beach up.

1507
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:41,320
-If I do a thorough search,
can I come back to my--
-Yes, yes.

1508
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,720
Of course.
If you do a thorough search
and we find it--

1509
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,880
We'll celebrate in your bar.

1510
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:48,120
Fair enough. Your arguments
have been persuasive.

1511
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,080
We'll meet you
back in your bar.

1512
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:52,320
Yes, in... 20 minutes.

1513
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,880
-Nn...
-No, 20 minutes.

1514
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:58,240
-It's a big job.
-I can cover that
in 20 minutes.

1515
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:02,320
So, whilst Hammond and May
got back to finishing off
their sections,

1516
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:04,720
I began on mine.

1517
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:21,360
You do have to be a little
bit careful with this
if you're doing this at home,

1518
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,240
trying to find something
in your garden.

1519
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:33,560
Right, this is the fuse wire.

1520
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:36,960
Put one end in there,
like that,

1521
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,640
and I light the other end,
and then I have, I'm told,

1522
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:43,760
three minutes to reach
minimum safe distance
in the MFB,

1523
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,760
before the explosions begin.

1524
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,680
OK.

-(FUSE FIZZING)
-Lovely.

1526
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,760
That is not three minutes!
Shit.

1527
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:56,920
Shit. Shit!

1528
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,560
Begin!

1529
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,440
Ah, I've turned it off!

1530
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:06,360
Ah! Traction control.

1531
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:11,680
-No, no, no!

(WIND WHISTLING)

1534
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:40,200
On the plus side, my work
had been extremely thorough.

1535
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:43,560
On the minus side, however...

1536
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:45,600
Find anything?

1537
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,280
Not a thing. You?

1538
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:51,640
Nothing. He's only got
that little bit to do.

1539
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:54,360
So there's nothing there.
What about there?

1540
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:56,920
And that's annoying because,
and I'm not making this up,

1541
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,200
I have just had this email...

It's... Listen, it's there!

-There's something there.

There.

JEREMY: Jesus. What's that?

What is it?

And on that terrible
disappointment,
it is time to end.

No more memories
from your childhood?

-No, I got nothing.
-OK, that is it.

for watching.
