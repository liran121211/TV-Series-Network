to the sweat box...

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,440

(TRAIN WHISTLE BLASTS)

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,280
Now, there are many ways
we could get across
this fascinating country.

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,320
We could use horses
or tuk-tuks or tractors.

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,480
But Mr Wilman decided we
should meet at this very spot

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,320
with three boats.

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,040
And that hasn't gone down
very well with my colleagues.

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,680
-No.
-There we go.

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,360
Because I hate... I'm from
Birmingham, I've explained.

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,200
Which is as far as you can
get from the sea in the UK--

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,560
-Full of canals!
-We don't do boats.

16
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,560
People from Birmingham
are always saying,

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,400
"It's the Venice
of the North,"

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,080
like Venetians always say,
"We live in the Birmingham
of the South."

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,920
Canals are just for
moving coal around.

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,520
I don't want
to do that either.

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,800
I'm from Birmingham,
I don't ski and I don't
do boats. End of.

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,520
-I signed up for a car show.
-Yes.

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,000
Not cookery, not restoring
frescoes and not boats.

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,160
-I don't like boats.
You can't trust a boat.
-That's exactly the right word.

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,600
You can't trust any vehicle
that isn't necessarily where
it was when you last parked it.

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,080
Problem No.1.
They can sink.
Cars can't do that.

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,880
-What are the viewers
gonna think?
-What?

28
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,880
What if you turned on
Jamie Oliver,

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,200
you thought, "I love that
cooking show...

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,600
Oh, he's doing some
watercolor painting."

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,760
-We did it in lorries--
-Lorries are vehicles.
They go on the road.

32

-We've been on horses.
-Oh, that went well!

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,600
Anyway, listen,
let's not get bogged down
with your prejudices.

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,560
Because the challenge
is actually quite simple.

35
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,080
We are here, yes,
near Siem Reap in
the north of Cambodia.

36
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,400
And we've got to
use all these waterways,
well, not all of them...

37
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,440
we've got to find a path
through them,

38
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,040
to Vung Tau, which is at the
bottom of the Mekong Delta,

39
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,080
in Vietnam.

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,720
There is, however,
one small problem.

expert on boats and boating.

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,400
-But...there's no water.
JEREMY: No, there isn't.

43
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,560
Is that pontoon thing there,
is that where Mr Wilman
thought we should meet?

-JAMES: He's a half-wit,
isn't he?

45
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,240
Anyway, the problem is...

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,880
there isn't enough water
in there to drown a witch.

47
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,160
RICHARD: No.

48
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,800
So, why don't we get
some wheels

49
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,160
and go and find some water

50
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,320
and then we'll launch
our boats there?

51
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,640
Right.

52
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,280

Having found some wheels,

53
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,880
we began our search.

There is global warming,
there is climate change.

And if you hosted
a car show now,

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,920

exhausting miles later,

66
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,720
the river was still
depressingly empty.

67
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
The problem we've got is
it's June

68
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,440
and it's supposed to be
raining here, really raining,

69
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,760
pouring down constantly.

70
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,800
And it isn't.
And it hasn't for months.

71
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,680
And when we reached
a fishing village,

72
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,280
the scale of the issue
became clear.

73
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,400
These houses, as you can see,
are on stilts

74
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,800
because that's where
the river should be.

75
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,680
Just stop here. Look.

76
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,440
That's where
the water level is.

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,480
JAMES: That's incredibly
gone, isn't it?

78
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,240
JEREMY: And it's
not just climate change
that's to blame,

79
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,520
because there's
another problem.

80
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,400
China.
They've dammed the river

81
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,880
that feeds all the water
systems round here.

82
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,920
How much sense
does that make, sitting here,

83
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,480
in your house on stilts
with no water around it,

84
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,720
to learn that the Chinese
have nicked all your water?

85
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,760
A funny world, isn't it?

86
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
The really funny thing is,

87
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,480
China builds a coal-fired
power station every
20 minutes or something

88
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,160
and everyone shouts at them,
saying,

"Oh, you're killing
the planet."

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,240
When they build a clean,
green, hydro-electric dam,

91
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,680
everyone shouts at them,
saying, "Now, look,
you're killing the planet!"

92

could do it without nicking
somebody else's water.

emerged from the gloom.

You probably don't know this,
but... Vietnam won.

146
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,400
So driving that
through Vietnam

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,320
is like walking through Old

and one wheel.

Oh, here he comes.

181
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
He's trying a new technique
here.

182
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,880
He's broken his flagpole.

That's the most inappropriate
thing I've ever seen.

What do you mean?

187
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,360
Well, it's entirely not
designed for where we are.

188
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,840
It's a river boat.

189
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,640
-We're on a lake.
-It's a pleasure craft.

190
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,200
But we're gonna be on rivers.

191
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,760
And it's only a gentle lake.
It's not stormy or anything.

-No, of course I haven't.

-It's a four-cylinder diesel.

That's a Ford Focus. And
it's got a new engine in it.

Mm-hm.

But it's...

223

Is that because of
its provenance?

No, I had to build it.

-No.

Hold on, hold on.

227
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,280
It's incredibly complicated.

228
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,960
They had to find the original
designs of the original hull,

229
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,040
work out where the engines
went, why it's mid-engined...

230
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,320
It was an immensely
complicated thing to do
and I've done it.

231
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,480
And I bought a little bit of
history, at great expense,

232
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,120
back to Southeast Asia.

233
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,520
It's a fake, though.
That's essentially a kit car.

234
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,520
Is it based on the chassis of
a Beetle or a Triumph Herald?

235
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,960
-It's a purpose-made chassis.
-A two-litre Pinto engine.
-Yes, exactly.

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's a purpose-made chassis.

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,600
And a brand-new engine.

What we've got is a Corvette,
definitely.

241
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,600
That is a Corvette.
Nothing wrong with them.

I've just thought
of something.

I haven't christened my boat.

248
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,360
So I quickly organised
an official ceremony.

and all who sail in her.

by the way.

ceremony complete

258
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,920
and the rainy season over,

259
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,560
it was time to begin
our epic 500-mile voyage.

-Thank you.
-Oh, sorry.

We are underway.

isn't it?

JEREMY: The first leg
of our aquatic road trip

266
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,760
involved a sprint
across the Tonlé Sap Lake.

267
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,680
And I'd been
looking forward to unleashing
some speed and power.

268
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,840
Sadly, though,
that wasn't possible.

269
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,280
OK, the problem is -
and it is a big one -

270
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
despite
that massive rainstorm,

271
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,240
this lake is 80 miles across.

272
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,160
And at this time of year,
it should be five times
more than that.

273
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,680
This is not the best
camerawork you've
ever seen and I apologise.

274
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
But I think it makes
the point.

275
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,120
This road here,

276
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,840
this is the road
that goes round the lake.

277
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,000
But the lake at the moment
is only that big.

278
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,040
It just isn't big enough.

279
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,880
Which means
it isn't deep enough.

wasn't the only problem.

is the sort of thing

314
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,400
I can imagine they gave
to Prince Charles
when he was a boy

315
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
to play with in the bath.

316
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,280
My boat, on the other hand,
was designed for fighting.

317
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,720
See, when the American
military realised
in the mid-'60s

318
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,880
that they needed
some kind of fast patrol boat

319
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,200
for the shallow rivers
of Southeast Asia,

320
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,040
they went to Hatteras,

321
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,240
which was a very respectable
boat builder in America
and said,

322
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
"You know that pleasure craft
you make,

324
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,840
Could you convert that, move
the engines further forward,

325
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
fit it with jets
instead of propellers,

326
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,320
give it a range of 250 miles
and a cruising speed
of 25 knots?"

327
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
Massive job, really massive.

328
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,120
And Hatteras had it ready
in six days!

329
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,160
Six days!

330
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
What they created was epic.

331
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,280
But even so, I had to have
this made because today,

332
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,320
there are no working
PBRs left.

333
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,840
And I find
that extraordinary.

the other memorabilia
from the Vietnam War -

Hueys and guns and
fighter planes and so on,

336
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,880
but nobody thought to say,
"Let's save a PBR."

337
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,880
It's a brilliant
bit of design,

With the shopping done,

520
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,040
we resumed our journey

521

00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,200
Hammond too
had mended his engines.

525
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,360
But he daren't fire them up

526
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,760
for fear of destroying them
in the mud.

527
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,200
So he was still being towed.

528
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,840
I found a very kind and
generous local fisherman

529
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,880
to pull me along
behind his little boat,

530
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,640

a silencer on it.

powerful enough,

so he found a mate
and then another mate,

534
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,280

all their boats together.

JAMES: Thank you.

542
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,840
But even so,
I had run into a problem.

543
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,680
Right, this is
the end of the lake.

544
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,200
I've made it.

545
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,240
And there's the river,
I think, over there.

546
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,680
However, between me and it...

547
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,200
there is a small obstacle.

548
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,160
The mouth of the river was
absolutely jammed with
densely packed weed.

549
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,840
So, to get through it,
I decided to ditch

Soon, I was also being towed.

So I had time to reflect
on the awfulness
of our boating holiday.

586

I mean, it's farcical.

first of all.
Nice to have you here.

No time for
pleasantries, though.

605
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,320
The problem we have is
that is a very significant
chunk of weeds,

606
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:31,640
and this can do everything
except go through them.

607
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,960
The issue was that my giant
V8s would suck the leaves

608
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
into the jets
and clog them up.

609
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,240
So Hammond and May
decided to slice a path
through the veg patch

610
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,280
using their old-fashioned
props.

for the antique, eh?

what's the most amazing thing
about these reeds,

apart from that they look
like giant flat-leaf parsley?

him correctly,

two days of frustration,

were able to open the taps.

this was great

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,960
Ghastly little Brummie
in his HMS Pornography.

683
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,080
Having lost
the ridiculous drag race,

684
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,400
I proposed
a high-speed brake test.

685
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,560
Ready? We're in full
forward thrust with my jets.

686
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,400
And I'm about to go
into full reverse thrust.

687
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,320
Instantly.
Just lowers some buckets down

688
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,640
and the water shoots forwards
instead of back.

689
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,880
What Hammond didn't know
is that this is a PBR party
piece.

690
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,000
Three...two...one...
Go.

691
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,920
Jesus Christ!

692
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
(WHOOPS WITH LAUGHTER)

693
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,640
No, I-I will give you that!
You won that!

694
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,640
That was quite a soaking.

695
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,560
Famously, these PBRs can stop
from top speed to a dead stop

696
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,600
in their own length, 31 feet.

697
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,360
There's water still dribbling
down that camera, look,
from that wave!

698
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,120
I think I just proved...
that story's true.

699
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,640
JAMES: Meanwhile,
several miles back,

700
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,160
I'd pinned my engine
to try and catch up
with the other two.

701
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,160
Oh, cock!

702
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,160
My cushion's in the water.

703
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,480
Bollocks!

704
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,600
So, if I go full-right
steering...

705
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,960
Stop.

706
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
What the bloody hell is...?

707
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,520
Hammond, you've gotta try
a bit of wave jumping,
it's hilarious.

708
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,920
(LAUGHTER)
Oh, I like that game!

709
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,640
There's Richard Hammond
playing in the waves.

710
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,400
What could possibly go wrong?

711
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,480
Unlikely to be a fire
for once.

712
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,640
(SQUEALS DELIGHTEDLY)

713
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,440
Damn it, I'm enjoying it!
Must not enjoy boating.

714
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,960
Ya-ha-ha-hay!

715
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,000
(BLEEP)

716
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,480
JEREMY: While May
entertained the locals,

717
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,960
Hammond and I were nearing
Cambodia's capital city.

718
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,680
Yes! Phnom Penh.

719
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,760
There's Phnom Penh
dead ahead.

720
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
I am in slight wonderment.

721
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,160
Nobody told me
when I failed my A Levels

722
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,600
that one day
I'd be driving a PBR

723
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,160
down the Tonlé Sap River
into Phnom Penh.

724
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,920
Mainly because back
then Cambodia was...

725
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,440
...entirely impossible
to get into

726
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,160
because it was run by
the biggest lunatic
the world's ever seen,

727
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,040
Pol Pot.

728
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,800
The man killed 25 per cent
of the Cambodian population.

729
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
25 per cent.

730
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,880
He just said that anybody
who could speak
a foreign language,

731
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,640
or who had soft hands,
or wore glasses...

732
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,640
Anyone remotely intelligent
had to be killed.

733
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,840
If you haven't seen the movie
The Killing Fields,

734
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,640
please watch it, please.

735
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,160
You'll get an idea from that
of the horror.

736
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,840
Having parked up, we decided
to wait for James at the FCC.

737
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,040
I reckon this is
one of the coolest bars

738
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,440
anywhere in the world.

739
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,040
Back in the day
when Cambodia was,
let's say, a troubled nation,

740
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,200
this is where all the foreign
correspondents for all of
the world's media outlets

741
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,840
used to meet for a drink,

742
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,000
hence FCC, Foreign
Correspondents' Club.

743
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,200
RICHARD: It's when there was
some romance in journalism.

744
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,960
Oh, and expense accounts.

745
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,200
And drinking.
They drank a lot.

746
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,640
-You can feel it in the room.
-You can.

747
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,400
You can sense
ruined cirrhosis.

748
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,680
Some intelligent,
hammered minds.

749
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,880
They used to come in here
with guns they'd found,

750
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,160
get absolutely slaughtered,

751
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,040
and then just shoot
guns from the balconies.

752
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,160
You could do clay beer-bottle
shoots but with AKs!

753
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
"I've drunk 17 beers."

754
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,840
"And we're going to have
a considerable fight."

755
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,760
"And then I'm going to write
my copy with a broken nose."

756
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,000
JEREMY: After
we'd raised a glass or ten
to the ghosts of the past,

757
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,040
James finally arrived.

758
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,520
And we decided
to buy some things

759
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,320
to make our lives on board
more comfortable.

760
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,600
Oooh, missed 'em.

761
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,600
Why don't we go to the market
first of all?

762
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,400
A real local market
for local people?

763
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,920
-Yes.
-Yeah, let's go there.

764
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,160
-Come on!
-Yeah!

765
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,000
That's using internal
combustion.

766
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,040
What about global warming?

767
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,920
Eventually, we found
the local market.

768
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,920
And immediately
we were distracted
by all the pretty watches.

769
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,080
That's a Breitling.

770
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,640
I thought Breitling would
take better care of
their display than this.

771
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,520
Look at the Hublot.
That's a tasteful watch.

772
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,920
And so light
for such exquisite quality.

773
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,960
And all these diamonds.

774
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,160
-Omega.
-Omega?

775
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,000
See, that is my Omega.

776
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,280
And this one is orange but in
every other way, identical.

777
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,520
Jezza?

778
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,000
They haven't realised it,

779
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,520
but there's
a gold Rolex there

780
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,640
and there's a Planet Ocean
Omega there.

781
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,680
I just asked how much
a Seamaster is.

782
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,360
These are about £3,000
in the UK, yes?

783
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
-Yes.
-Guess how much
they are here.

784
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,880
I don't know, 2,000.

785
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,400
-£50.
-£50?

786
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,360
I mean, I know their
overheads are low,
but that's extraordinary.

787
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,040
-That must mean the mark-up
on those watches is enormous.
-Exactly.

788
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,400
Oh, hello. Hello!

789
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,560
Is that a real Jaguar belt?

790
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,680
I've got a Ja-a-ag.

791
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,200
How much is this?

792
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,920
22 Dollars.

793
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,320
25. And here,
because you're a nice chap...

794
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,160
-Yeah?
-Erm...keep it. Thank you.

795
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,760
Nothing on God's green earth
annoys me more

796
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,440
than European people
haggling in places like this.

797
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,760
Cos they're haggling
over a dollar...

798
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,440
It doesn't matter to you,
it doesn't matter,

799
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,280
and it matters a lot
to them.

800
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,880
Just pay the price.

801
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,920
-How much?
-75.

802
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,440
Ow! I was thinking 25.

JEREMY: Having stocked up
on luxury goods,

804
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,560
we went in search of
some more practical items.

00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,560
Oh, hello!

806
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,280
Yes.

Something for
getting rid of flies.

00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,160
Here.

That looks Hindu.

-Is it very old?
-Yes.

It is? Oh.

Having bought all we needed
to make a night afloat
more comfortable,

825
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,480
we immediately checked
into a five-star hotel...

826
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,280
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

that's very kind. Thank you.

Which I...
Look at the lighting on that.

00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,040
It's one of the cleverest...
Cos it looks like curtains.

832
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,040
JAMES: It looks like theatre
curtains closing or opening.

833
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,080
Is that where the Prime
Minister hangs out?

834

-No, no, don't, don't, don't.
-He's not there?

00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,800
No, don't call him
Prime Minister.

836
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,200
Well, what is he, then?

837
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,040
Well, weirdly, I was reading
the Financial Times.

838
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,000
And I've saved it.
Hang on.

"Lord Prime Minister and

842
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,760
So, if you are referring
to him, you must say,

"Lord Prime Minister and

00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,440
I've got paint,
paint brushes,

852
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,280
and then I've got
spray paint.

853
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,800
Where's the bicycles?

854
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,520
Oh, they're here.
Thank you.

855
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,760
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.

856
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,040
I love to follow you.

857
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,880
JEREMY: The next morning,
I fitted my new lavatory seat
and air-conditioning unit.

858
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,520
James installed
his drinks fridge.

859
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,520
And after Hammond had
slipped into his new shirt...

860
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,120
we set off.

861
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,960
And immediately, it was hard
to keep a straight face.

862
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,040
We have played jokes
on one another before,

863
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,840
but I'm not sure we've ever
pulled one as good as this.

864
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,640
From where Richard Hammond
is standing,

865
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,800
he has no idea what
James and I have done.

866
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,880
JEREMY OVER RADIO:
Hey, guys?

867
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,080
This is the first time
we've run under our
own steam as a three.

868
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,160
RICHARD: Yeah, it feels good.

869
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,600
I'm not sure it feels that
good, though, does it?

870
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,640
Do you know
what might feel better?

871
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,600
(ENGINES REVVING)

872
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,560
JAMES: Thank you.

873
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,800
Very funny.

874
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,600
JEREMY: We were now
150 miles into our journey

875
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,240
and leaving the Tonlé Sap

876
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,000
to join the world's
most iconic river -

877
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
the mighty Mekong.

The jet skis
you rent on holiday,

886
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,760
they have one impeller
in a tube,

887
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,160
suck water in, shoot it out
the back and go along.

888
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,760
The jets in this
are a bit different.

889
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,240
They're two-stage impellers.

890
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,880
One sucks the water in
and gets it spinning,

891
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,840
fires it into the second one
that properly hammers it
out the back.

892
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,480
Instant acceleration,
and a lot of it.

893
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,560
Speed boating.

894
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,680
There really was one of these
in Miami Vice.

895
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,760
Don Johnson drove around
in it with his sleeves
rolled up, looking cool.

896
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,320
And, in fact,
this is a Scarab Thunder,

897
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,520
and it was built specially
for a television series

898
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,560
called Thunder
starring Hulk Hogan.

899
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,600
It lasted one season.

900
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,400
It was crap.

901
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,200
But the boat exists.

902
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,120
JEREMY: Another funny thing
about boats.

903
00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:00,960
When you have a car,
you never, ever run it
at max revs all day.

904
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,800
But with boats,
that's what you do.

905
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,000
Have you ever driven a car
where you've just...

906
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,000
maxed it from the moment
you start in the morning

907
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,040
and left it maxed all day?

908
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,600
Yeah, I had a company
Renault Clio for a while

909
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,480
and that's how I drove it.

910
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,400
JAMES: Meanwhile,
a long way further back,

911
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,040
I was contemplating
the enormity of
this incredible river.

912
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,320
JAMES: Here's a stat for you.

913
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,480
The volume of fish
caught in the Mekong

914
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,960
is 13 times greater
than the volume of fish

915
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,280
caught in all of America's
inland waterways combined.

916
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:46,040
60 million people depend on
the Mekong for food or
their livelihood.

917
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,080
60 million people.

918
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,680
So messing this up
with things like damming

919
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,800
could be as bad
as nuclear war.

920
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,240
RICHARD: Up ahead, Jeremy
and I were trying to create

921
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,120
a professional impression
at the Vietnamese
border checkpoint.

922
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,040
-Oh, that hasn't worked.
-(HEAVY THUD)

923
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,440
-Oh.
-(HEAVY THUD)

924
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,760
JEREMY: Yeah.

925
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,800
-Hi.
-Thank you.

926
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,840
We're experienced travellers
passing through.

927
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,680
Yeah, we were born in boats,
really.

928
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,680
Hammond, I'm really sorry,

929
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,720
but the customs man's dog
has died.

930
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,240
Oh, no. Oh, what
a terrible time to arrive.

931
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,320
I'm not sure
he's gonna be very happy.

932

Hello.

933
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,000
I'm beginning to suspect
there may be man-made fibres

934
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,480
involved in this
shirt of mine.

935
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,520
It's uncomfortable.

donned a PBR-crew

939
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,200
Right.

JAMES: I, too, was
in Vietnam at this point,

959
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,240
and something was
dawning on me.

960
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,640
Strikes me I'm being
a bit of a mug because
I'm thrashing this boat,

961
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:15,480
but it only does 23 km/h,
about 11.5 knots,

962
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,720
and I'm trying to catch up
with people I don't even
want to be with anyway.

963
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,240
So, I decided to ease off and
break out my new fishing rod.

964
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,200
That is working a treat.
I should really have
a spinner on

965
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,080
or something like that, but...

966
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,320
Yeah, that's fishing.

967
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,840
In the most densely
fish-populated

968
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,320
fishing place in the world.

969
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,520
JEREMY: After a few miles,
I turned off the Mekong

970
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,160
and asked Hammond to follow
me to the town of Chau Doc.

971
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:05,680
And this time, when we
arrived under the watchful
gaze of yet more officials,

972
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,640
we were determined
to park well.

973
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,320
Jeremy? You've now got
my boat and I'm not on it!

974
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,160
JEREMY: What?

975
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,280
I'm not on it
and it's no longer tied on!

976
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,480
- It's not tied on
on that end?
-No, it's come off!

977
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,920
-Why didn't you tie it on?
-I thought I had!

978
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,520
Oh, for God's sake. Your
boat's got free, Hammond.

979
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:32,960
I quickly picked up Richard
so he could re-acquire
his boat.

980
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,960
-(ALARM BLARES)
-OK, that's
that test concluded,

981
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,120
"Where would it go?" test.
It went to there.

982
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,960
JEREMY: Yeah, exactly.
So we now know--

983
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,160
That's the drift,
we've established the drift,
it goes that way.

984
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,720
Everything we need to know.

985
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,720
JEREMY: Finally,
we managed to tie
ourselves to some land.

986
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,000
And that is how we do that.

987
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,440
And it was at this point
Hammond got the joke.

988
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,320
(RICHARD LAUGHS)

989
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,560

-What?

00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,960
What you've done to my boat.

991
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,520
-Have I been...
-Yes, all day.

992
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,000
-How have I not seen that?
-You haven't seen it all day.

993
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:10,080
You've been through
Cambodian customs,
Vietnamese immigration,

994
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,720
-Vietnamese customs.
-Oh, my God!

995
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,800
You've driven probably
100 miles down the Mekong.

996
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,640
-I waved at people. "Hi!"
-The thing is, Hammond,

997
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,960
it's very bad luck to change
the name of a boat.

998
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,160
Oh, God.

999
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,360
Anyway, I'll leave you
to ponder that.

1000
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,120
The reason why...

1001
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,160
we've parked here
in this quite tight spot

1002
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,520
and come to this town
is because

1003
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,000
I want to tell you
a little story.

1004
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,240
On January 31st, 1968

1005
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,920
the town of Chau Doc
was overrun...

1006
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,080
as part of
the Tet Offensive.

1007
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,600
(GUNFIRE)

1008
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:02,800
A flotilla of PBRs set about
rescuing Americans

1009
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,360
whilst others covered the
evacuation with a stream
of heavy machine-gun fire.

1010
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,960
It then turned out that in
a house near the hospital,

1011
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,480
a 24-year-old American nurse
called Maggie Frankot
was stranded.

1012
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,760
Her Jeep was shot to pieces.

1013
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,600
The fighting was everywhere.

1014
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,800
There were Viet Cong soldiers
all around her house.

1015
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,720
Some of them were even in it.

00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,440
eventually reached
Maggie's location.

1019
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,400
And after a massive battle,

1020
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,400
she was dragged from the
house with an injured knee

1021
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,440
and carried to one
of the waiting boats.

1022
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,680
Afterwards, the Special
Forces soldier responsible
for these heroics,

1023
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,400
Sergeant Drew Dix,
was honoured with
a Presidential Citation.

1024
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,440
But the captain of the PBR

1025
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,760
that sped her away
from the town and to safety,

1026
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,320
a man called Lieutenant
William H Buddy O'Brien,

1027
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,360
did even better because,
a year later...

1028
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,000
she married him.

1029
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,840
I should call this thing
The Love Boat.

1030
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,200
As it was getting late,
I decided to pull over

1031
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,080
and use my improvised kitchen

1032
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:38,560
to produce something I'd
learned on a recent holiday.

1033
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,600
-I came to Vietnam,
as you know...
-Yes.

1034
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,480
And in the mornings,
I learnt Vietnamese,

1035
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,800
and then in the afternoons,
I did a cookery course

1036
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,240
on how to make Pho.

1037
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,240
I mean, a lot of people think
I'm just this big,

1038
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,280
blundering idiot
that can't wire a plug.

1039
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,840
-That's the fella
I'm thinking about.
-Absolutely right, I am.

1040
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,760
-Do you like onions?
-Yeah.

1041
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,960
Now,
this is good-quality beef.

1042
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,280
I'm tempted to cook it
a bit on the ladle.

1043
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,560
In Pho, there are 124
different herbs and spices.

1044
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,480
Erm...the...
the car element

1045
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,920
of our car show is less
prominent at the moment.

1046
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,720
Because we're on a boat
talking about cooking.

1047
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,600
-But in a minute...
-Yes?

1048
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,360
...or a second,
they'll cut back to James

1049
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,480
who will be talking about
some mechanical thing.

1050
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,920
You're right.

1051
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,960
Oh, listen to that
interesting beat.

1052
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,760
(ENGINE HUMMING)

1053
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,240
My engine goes in and out
of phase with the engine
on the camera boat.

1054
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,840
Can you hear it?

1055
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,040
If I change the revs
by a tiny amount...

1056
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,600
Whir, whir, whir...

1057
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,240
-Right, we are good to go.
-Thank you.

1058
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,640
Oh, I say!

1059
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,160
This is not half bad.

1060
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,080
Seriously? Or are you
just being nice to me?

1061
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,880
No, it is...
It is genuinely very good.

1062
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,680
Look at that view.

1063
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,480
RICHARD: Mm.

1064
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,120
JEREMY:
After we'd had our fill,

1065
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,960
it was time to clear up.

1066
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,440
-That's really hot!
-Yeah, it is hot.

1067
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,880
-Yeah.
-Let go.

1068
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,320
Observe the genius that I am.

1069
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,200
We're not polluting
the river, by the way.

1070
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,800
That all adds to the
nutrients, doesn't it?

1071
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,600
-That's biodegradable.
-That is not polluting
the river.

1072
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,520
Anyone who writes in
and says you're
polluting the river,

1073
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,160
-I shall write back and go,
"No, we're just not."
-"You're an arse!"

1074
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,200
There they are, I think.

1075
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,000
Yes.

1076
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,440
May, is that you
coming out of the gloom?

1077
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,800
Yes, it is. Ahoy.

1078
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,640
Perfect timing, mate,
we're leaving.

1079
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,360
We've gotta go find
the Mekong.

1080
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,560
Hang on, I thought
we were having a Pho?

1081
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,600
RICHARD OVER RADIO: We did
have one. It was brilliant.

1082
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,960
JEREMY OVER RADIO: Yeah,
sorry, I tried to save you some

1083
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
but Richard
threw it in the river,

1084
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,920
literally threw your
portion in the river.

1085
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,880
Well, thanks very much
after my very arduous day.

1086
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,360
JEREMY: Sadly, his
day was about to get
even more arduous

1087
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,280
because we had to
re-find the Mekong,

1088
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,400
and I was the only one
equipped for night running.

1089
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,880
JAMES: My situation update.

1090
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,080
I am steering by
my head torch

1091
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,440
strapped to the flagpole
thing on the front.

1092
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,160
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1093
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,440
Why do I always
end up with no headlights?

1094
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,080
Every bloody trip.

1095
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,600
RICHARD:
And to make things worse...

1096
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,640
Gentlemen,
I have a poorly engine.

1097
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,680
It's overheating badly.

1098
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,720
It's starting to backfire
and cough.

1099
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,600
The reason you're having
all these problems

1100
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,800
is because you've changed
the name of your boat.

1101
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:46,080
RICHARD OVER RADIO:
Yes, well,
I didn't change it, did I?

1102
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,480
JEREMY: As I was
the only one with sat nav
and a proper light,

1103
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,520
it was up to me to navigate.

1104
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,640
And I just saw a little
passageway. Hang on.

1105
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,200
There is,
there is a passageway.

1106
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,440
Follow me.

1107
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,080
JEREMY OVER RADIO:
I know this looks dodgy

1108
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,840
but this is
the way back to the Mekong.

1109
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,360
Ooh.

1110
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,800
JEREMY: However, as
soon as I made the turn,

1111
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,200
I realised I had a problem.

1112
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,240
Not more weeds.
Please God, no.

1113
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,800
Any minute now,
I'm under the boat,

1114
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,680
picking bits of
lettuce out of my jets.

1115
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,560
And, sure enough,
100 yards later...

1116
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,600
(ENGINE REVS)

1117
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,200
That's me dead.
I have no drive.

1118
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,440
I solved this by paying
a local to clear the intakes.

1119
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,400
And then I soldiered
on with him and our
translator for company.

1120
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,840
This was useful because
it meant I could
clear up something

1121
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,040
that had been puzzling me.

1122
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,080
Could you answer this for me?

1123
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,120
My boat is called...
(RAISED INFLEXION): Du Ma.

1124
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,160
(LAUGHS)

1125
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,120
And everybody laughs
when I go, "Du Ma."

1126
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,560
Everybody laughs for a reason.

1127
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,600
But it means "Boat Machine."

1128
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,720
Boat Machine?

1129
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,760
Du: boat.
Ma: machine.

1130
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,880
So, why is that funny?

1131
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,320
It's a similar
pronunciation to

1132
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,840
"f*** your mother"
in Vietnamese.

1133
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,240
-What?
-Mmm. (LAUGHS)

1134
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,240
-Yes.
-You're joking?

1135
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,880
Oh, right.

1136
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,640
I'm losing drive.
I'm losing drive.

1137
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,640
-(HEAVY THUD)
-Oh, shit.

1138
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,680
I'm in a tree. Big problem.

1139
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,320
As it was late
and Hammond's boat
was poorly,

1140
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:50,840
and I was in a tree,
we decided to make camp.

1141
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,720
And we woke the next morning
in a blanket of drizzle

1142
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,200
with no idea where we were.

1143
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,840
It's all gone a bit
English-boating-holiday,
hasn't it?

1144
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,160
Yeah.

1145
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,480
Why did he turn off
the Mekong, anyway?

1146
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:13,240
He wanted to stop off
and make a history
programme or something.

1147
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,320
No, listen, he did a cooking
show last night as well.
You missed that.

1148
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,360
My pho was so light
and beautiful...

1149
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,440
Oh, this man's
going to see me!

1150
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,040
RICHARD: They're gonna
be scarred for life.

1151
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,960
-Morning.
-(DOGS BARKING)

1152
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,080
If he falls in
and follows his own turd--

1153
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:34,520
-Trousers.
-..into the lavatory bowl...

1154
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,720
and emerges with it
stuck to his head...

1155
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,760
Someone would say, "There's
a particularly massive turd
in the river this morning."

1156
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,000
JAMES: With the morning
ablutions complete,

1157
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,840
it was time to move on.

1158
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,080
And, since it was Jeremy
who'd got us lost,

1159
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:54,960
we decided it was up to him
to get us un-lost.

1160
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,160
You're in charge of charts.
Lead the way.

1161
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,840
We shall reacquire
the Mekong very soon.

1162
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,960
Yeah, I hope so.
For your sake, really.

1163
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,120
JEREMY: I admit
we are entirely lost

1164
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,160
and none of these canals
are marked on the map.

1165
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,600
(SNIFFS) Ooh.

1166
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,960
JEREMY:
A few miles later, while
still not on the Mekong,

1167
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,320
we came across
a floating market...

1168
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,720
(LIVELY CHATTER)

1169
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,800
...and decided
to buy some breakfast.

1170
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,880
RICHARD: It's not really
a supermarket, is it?

1171
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,680
Where do I...
What do I do?

1172
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,160
JEREMY: You drive in there,
pull up alongside a boat

1173
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,360
where you like the look of
the produce, and then buy it.

1174
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,840
For Richard and James,
this turned out to be easy.

1175
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,840
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1176
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,880
But for me,
in the unruly PBR...

1177
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,320
Oh, my God!

1178
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,280
(BLEEP) hell!

1179
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,640
I can't steer it.

1180
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,560
-Oh, my giddy aunt.
-(CRASHING)

1181
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,040
-(WOMAN CALLS OUT)
-Sorry. Sorry.

1182
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,800

Hello. What's that?

1188
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,440
-(SHE LAUGHS) Yes.
-50 cents. OK.

1189
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:21,600
-OK. OK.
-I've bought...

1197
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,240
Thank you.
No idea what that is.

1198
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,800

This is looking good.

1199
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:44,360
I think, for once...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1200
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,880
-It's gone wrong.

Oh, God. Sorry.

1202
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,320
Oh... Yeah.

1203
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,400
JEREMY: I eventually left
empty-handed.

1204
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,280
But, as James
prepared his breakfast...

1205
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,040
Ahh!

1206
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,360
...we found the Mekong.

1207
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,440
Sadly, however,
it didn't end our problems.

1208
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,320
If we followed this
particular bit of the Mekong,
or this one,

1209
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,840
or any of the others,

1210
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,520
we'd end up in the sea,

1211
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,280
and avoiding any form of sea

1212
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,760
in our riverboats
was critical.

1213
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:20,240
So, we had to find another
path through the delta.

1214
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,440
This meant turning off
the Mekong again

1215
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,480
and onto another canal,
which made Hammond very angry.

1216
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,440
RICHARD OVER RADIO:
Oh, this looks weird!

1217
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,280
We're on another
bloody canal!

1218
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,320
Oh, for God's sake.

1219
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,240
Hammond, if I still had
50 cals on the front of this,

1220
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:39,080
I promise I would open up
on you right now.

1221
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,080
RICHARD OVER RADIO:
Yes, well, you haven't.
And there's a reason for that.

1222
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,960
Because you'd probably
lose them the same way
you lost the massive river.

1223
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,920
You'd lose
your massive machine gun.

1224
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,040
It cannot be this way.

1225
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:57,480
JEREMY: I was convinced
we were going in
the right direction

1226
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,880
and for the right reasons.

1227
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,560
But, still, none of
these canals appeared
on my sat-nav system.

1228
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:18,640
OK. So, we're going south.
We're going the wrong way.

1229
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,840
If I do a left and a right...

1230
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,720
we'll wiggle about
and I'll be fine.

1231
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,080
I think there's
a left turn here.

1232
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:36,960
If we take this,
I think that'll help us
find the correct Mekong.

1233
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,800
Or just get us more lost.

1234
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,680
Jeremy Clarkson, would you
like to rethink this?
This is your chance.

1236
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:52,080
Eventually, we came to
an aquatic T-junction.

1237
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,160
So, which way is it?

1238
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,880
Right, chaps,
we're gonna go...

1239
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,440
Take a right, James.

1240
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,320
RICHARD: I followed James,

1241
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:16,200
which meant Jeremy was
directing us from the back.

1242
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:19,600
So this right turn
that you announced
with absolute confidence

1243
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,200
is based on what?

JEREMY OVER RADIO:

1245
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,680
Hammond, when you
get through that,

1246
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,960
could you just look back
and see if I can?

1247
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,160
-What?
-Hammond! Hammond! Hammond!

before I could turn round.

We can see
where the tide was,

1282
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:26,600
so we simply have to wait
for it to come back up again.

01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,000
Still, at least
it then rained,

1346
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:07,320
so I didn't have to worry
about the fire spreading.

JEREMY: Being a caring soul,

1350
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,800
I decided to go back
to see if I could help.

1351
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,320
Switching to
wet weather mode.

1352
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,400
And I'll give James a fly-by.
I know he enjoys them.

1353
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,960

JEREMY: What's the matter?

1359
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,840
Uh, I've lost drive
on both sides, pretty much.

1360
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:40,560
Oh, actually,
I know how to...

1361
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,880
fix a slipping prop shaft.

1362
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,920
-How?
-Get the boat
out of the water,

1363
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,960
send for new parts
from America,

1364
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,640
and then ask a man
to fit them.

1365
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:54,000
JEREMY:
With that advice dispensed,
I was on my way back.

1366

(CLINKING)

1367
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,840
JAMES: Oh, no.

1368
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:05,000
We're hoping to reach
the finish point today.

1369
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,320
We're only 100 kilometres now
from Vung Tau.

1370
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:13,400
But, at this rate, I'm not
sure that's gonna happen.

1371
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,440
RICHARD: In order to hold us
up as little as possible,

1372
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,680
I attached myself
to a camera boat,

1373
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:21,640
so I could do repairs
on the move.

1374
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:25,080
This one is not firing
on all cylinders.
That one's not good either.

1375
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,880
I'm gonna change all of
the plugs, all of the leads.

1376
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,880
The fuel is filthy
around here,

1377
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,920
so I'm gonna change
the fuel filters.

1378
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,080
I'm gonna clean
the air filters.

1379
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,280
There is a leak coming
through the exhaust stack

1380
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,960
at the back,
with a blown hose.

1381
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,280
I've got to change that
or I'll sink.

1382
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,440
To work!

1383
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,600
JAMES: Leaving Richard
to try and mend

1384
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:48,000
his burning colander...

1385
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:53,520
I finally sailed clear
of the rain.

1386
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,440
Oh, no!

1387
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:00,520
My expensive Bell & Ross
is all fogged up.

1388
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,400
That's going back.

1389
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,520
JEREMY: Even further ahead,
I'd left the canal

1390
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,840
and was entering one of
the delta's giant estuaries.

1391
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,800
This one's a long way
from home,

1392
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,200
taking a lot of Vietnamese
training shoes to Panama.

1393
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,560
Power is good.
Temperature's good.

1394
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:34,320
Fuel is very... Ooh, Christ,
fuel is very low. Oh, dear.

1395
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,760
JEREMY:
But, actually, that was OK

1396
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,680
because in busy,
industrious Vietnam

1397
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:43,520
you can summon
a Deliveroo-style
refuelling boat.

1398
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,040
I'm heading at 120 degrees.

1399
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,280
OK, I'll keep my eye open.

1400
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,320
And, sure enough,
half an hour later...

1401
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:56,240
-(HORN TOOTS)
-Oh, here he is.

1402
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,520
You see, this is service,

1403
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:02,120
from this
environmentally-friendly
boat that's arrived.

1404
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,840
I've been joined
by the Rainbow Warrior.

1405
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,000
Actually creating
a lake of soot.

1406
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,880
Once I'd refuelled,
I sailed into what is -

1407
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,920
for my boat at least...

1408
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,120
home.

1409
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:31,440
Today, this particular
area is known as
the National Biosphere.

1410
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,800
This is one of the most
fertile places on Earth.

1411
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,640
Anything grows here.

1412
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,240
You could plant
Richard Hammond

1413
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,680
and in the morning
he'd be three feet taller.

1414
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:44,800
But the Americans used to
call it something different.

1415
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:49,160
They called it The Forest
of the Assassins.

1416
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,400
And it was the job
of the PBR boys

1417
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,320
to root those assassins out.

1418
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,040
That was no easy task

1419
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:02,960
'cause we're talking about
500 square miles of forest,

1420
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,560
criss-crossed by 3,000
miles of rivers and creeks.

1421
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,360
It was the perfect place

1422
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,440
for the Viet Cong
to wage guerrilla warfare...

1423
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:20,840
against America's little
unarmoured war boats.

1424
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,920
Initially, the crews
were trained in America
by the army,

1425
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,760
and then they were
trained by the navy,

1426
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:31,880
and then they were told
to just come out here
and get on with it.

1427
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:39,000
They literally put four
teenagers, as often as not,

1428
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:44,320
on an armed speedboat
and sent them out here
to do fighting.

1429
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,520
Armaments?

1430
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,000
Well, all of the boats
had twin 50 cals upfront...

1431
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,560
and a single 50
at the back.

1432
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:00,160
But, beyond that, the captain
could fit what he wanted.

1433
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:03,400
Some went for 40-millimetre
grenade launchers.

1434
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,760
Some had
60-millimetre mortars.

1435
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,000
Some had rocket launchers.

1436
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,920
Some carried Claymore mines
to leave on the banks.

1437
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:16,200
And it was
the same free-for-all
when it came to air support.

1438
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:21,400
Some PBR captains
called in fast jets
when they were attacked.

1439
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:25,320
And some preferred
to work in tandem
with helicopter gunships.

1440
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:33,440
Some guys, however,
liked to handle the fight
on their own.

1441
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,920
There was one guy
called James E Williams.

1442
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,080
He came round a corner.
His route was blocked

1443
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:41,000
by eight enemy boats
all firing at him.

1444
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:44,600
So, he ordered his front
machine-gunner to fire back,

1445
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,720
and then engaged full speed

1446
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:49,200
and rammed into
the enemy boats.

1447
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:52,880
Then he turned round,
engaged full speed again,

1448
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:56,960
and rammed into the ones
that hadn't been turned
into matchwood

1449
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,080
on his first pass.

1450
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:02,200
He got the Congressional
Medal of Honor for that one.

1451
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:05,320
And I'm not surprised.

1452
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,920
Of course, you'd imagine
that a plastic boat

1453
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:12,680
would be easy pickings
for a sniper hiding
in the undergrowth.

1454
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:18,440
But that's not so,
as I shall now demonstrate.

(ENGINE REVS)

1456
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,600
PBR captains
would always drive very fast,

1457
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:31,760
so they had steering,
and very close to the bank.

1458
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,000
If it was the bank where
the sniper was hiding...

1459
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:38,640
I mean, if you're in there,
you've got no chance.

1460
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:43,280
All you have to do
is keep the hammer down
and keep close to a bank.

1461
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,680
Then you're
a sniper's nightmare.

round this corner here,

1469
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,840
there were some
school children swimming,

1470
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:22,600
and a shark
was homing in for an attack.

1471
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,680
So, I ran the shark down,
and then got stuck
in my own wake.

1472
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,640
And it's just...
Well, I've crashed now.

1473

But the school children
are all fine.

1474
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,120
At first, a camera crew
tried to pull me off,

1475
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:38,320
but the PBR was too heavy.

1476

01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,800
Come on! Come on! Come on!

1511
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:39,600
-No, I won't have this!
-Yeah!

1512
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,320
Oh, God.

1513
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:47,800
Here we go into the reeds.

1514
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,880
Sleeping...
(TRUMPETS) ...elephant.

1515
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,800
Oh, my God.

1516
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:58,000
-(THUD)
-Sorry.

1517
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,920
Oh, cock.

1518
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,560
JEREMY: Hammond!
Hammond! Hammond!

1519
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,360
(THUDDING)

1520
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,840
Ah, that didn't fit.

1521
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:12,160
Oh, we've lost the thing
that's got us lost.

1522
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,600
RICHARD:
Well, this is crap, isn't it?

1523
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,160
(CLATTERING)

1524
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,320
(LAUGHS)

1525
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,960
Oh, shit!

1526
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,920
20 miles to go.

1527
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,840
What can possibly go wrong?

1528
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:49,320
As it turned out,
just about everything.

1529
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,720
(THUNDERCLAP)

1530
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,920
(THUNDER)

1531
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:59,160
This time, the rain was
the heaviest we'd seen.

1532
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,600
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1533
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,560
This is grim.

1534
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,240
(THUNDER)

1535
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,440
(BLEEP) hell,
I can't see a thing.

1536
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:16,200
JEREMY: Soon,
we were completely lost.

1537
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:25,280
Have I overtaken you?
Have you seen me go by?

1538
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:28,560
JAMES: I can't see a (BLEEP)
thing and I can't steer.

1539
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,400
JEREMY: When the rain
did eventually clear,

1540
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:37,200
we realised we had emerged
into the one thing

1541
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,080
I'd been trying
so desperately to avoid.

1542
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:44,080
OK, well, now,
what we've done...

1543
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:46,160
what I'm doing here...

1544
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:48,960
That's the sea.

1545
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:54,840
30 miles of open ocean
lay between us

1546
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,320
and the finishing line
at Vung Tau.

1547
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,280
But, as the water
didn't look too rough...

1548
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:10,960
we decided to put on some
life jackets and go for it.

1549
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,960
I've been thinking. Jeremy?

1550
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,360
The sea is in some ways
a lawless place,

1551
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,320
but in others there is
a strict code, isn't there?

1552
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,800
You stick together
through thick and thin,
face perils as one.

1553
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,600
Yeah. Thing is, though,

1554
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,880
to operate efficiently
as a team,

1555
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,320
each team member
has to be at their optimum.

1556
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,920
At this speed,
I'm not at my best.
I have no steering.

1557
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,760
JEREMY: And so...

1558
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,320
Three, two, one... Go.

1559
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,080
Funny.

1560
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:51,920
JEREMY: As it turned out,

1561
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,680
that would be the last
funny moment of the day.

1562
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,800
Oh, my God!

1563
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:02,400
-(THUD)
-Argh, fuck!

1564
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:06,040
I'll try standing up,
see if that helps.
With bent knee.

1565
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:09,240
-(THUD)
-Oh, no! Oh, God.

1566
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:16,920
God above,
this is just awful.

1567
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,320
-(RATTLING)
-Oh!

1568

(COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS)

1569
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,600
I'm gonna throw up
at this rate,

1570
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,160
not because of sea sickness
but because of

1571
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,360
the amount of salt water
in my mouth.

1572
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,640
(THUDDING)

1573
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,520
No!

(GROANS)

1575
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:01,320
This is a lot worse than
I thought it was going to be.

1576
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,120
It wasn't just
the rough seas.

1577
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,560
(HORN HONKS)

1578
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,000
We also had to weave our way
through the shipping lanes.

1579
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,760
There's a large tanker
dead ahead.

1580
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,920
Trawler off to my right.

1581
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,680
Sheez.

1582
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:22,840
I've managed to miss
that massive container ship.
That's something.

1583
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:30,000
$3.5 trillion worth of trade

1584
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,360
comes through these waters
every year.

1585
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,160
God knows how it isn't
all smashed to pieces

1586
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,920
when it gets to its destination.

1587
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,960
Jesus Christ.

1588
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,360
If one big wave goes
in there, I'm gonna get
very nose-heavy.

1589
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:51,680
And I cannot realistically
get up there to put it back.

1590
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:58,200
RICHARD: Meanwhile,
I'd finally managed
to put my roof up...

1591
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:01,240
Oh, yes. There's a chance.
There's a chance.

1592
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,720
...which was time well spent.

1593
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,880
Holy shit!

1594
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,240
Ohh, bollocks.

1595

it can't be worse than this.

Ohh! (BLEEP) Nora.

1601
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,880
It's gonna snap.

01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,680
I just pissed myself
standing up where I was.

is not an option.

I'm not sure we can do this.

one of our camera boats
was in very big trouble.

We're taking in too much water.

if it's dangerous.

1611

We'll never get there
at this rate.

lost control of his antique.

Argh.

JEREMY: After 15 miles, the
sea started to calm a little

1618
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,920
and I decided
to increase speed.

1619

01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:40,400

much more of this.

01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,640
Come on. I'm running in
fast now. I want this over.

01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,640
Argh!

1627
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:56,200
The top three worst things
I've ever done.

01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:59,320
JEREMY:
Mercifully, the finish line,
Vung Tau harbour,

1629
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,000
then hoved into view.

1630
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,120
Come on.
It can't be more than a mile.

1632
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,080
Well, that's brilliant.

1633
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:18,400
These last couple of hours
have damn nearly killed me.

1634
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,360
They probably have
James and Richard.

1635
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,960
I can't raise either
of them on the radio.

1636
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,760
I don't know where they are.

1637
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:28,000
I reached the jetty
very much alone.

1638
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,320
Sorry, there's no
film crews with me.

1639
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,880
Um, I don't know
where they are either.

1640
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:37,120
But Richard Hammond
is arriving.

1641
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:38,880
He's made it.

1642
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,200
Normally we'd celebrate
the end of a journey,

1643
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:52,080
but I'm not celebrating that.
Beyond brutal.

1644
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:54,680
Yeah, that was the hardest
thing I've ever done.

1645
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:58,520
Easily the hardest thing
I've ever done.
The most dangerous.

1646
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,840
JEREMY:
After a film crew arrived,
we disembarked.

1647
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:06,200
Have you really not heard
from James at all?

1648
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:08,320
No, nothing.

1649
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:14,000
But then, the Rover 90
hoved into view.

1650
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:19,320
It could be coming
with nobody on it,
like the Marie Celeste.

1651
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,000
Well, I did wo...
No, he is there.

1652
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,240
Look, there's a very
bedraggled dog at the helm.

01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,640
Yeah.

1654
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,160
Right.

1655
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,320
We've been very worried
about you.

1656
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:31,120
Have you? I was very worried
about me. But thank you.

it's still there.

-But we have survived.
-Yeah.

1661
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,720
And on that
terrible disappointment...

01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:49,120
-for Top Gear...
-(CHUCKLING)

1663
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:51,720
...it's time to say goodbye.
We'll be back.

01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,800
-See you very soon.
-See you soon.
