00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,880
Hello and welcome
to our last-ever <i>Grand Tour.</i>

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,920
Because this is the last time that James,
Richard and I will ever work together,

5
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,200
Mr Wilman said
we should do something important.

6
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,360
He said we should each buy
a medium-sized electric car

7
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,400
and then see how many laps
of the M25 we could do in it

8
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,320
on one charge.

9
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,840
And we decided to ignore him
and come here.

00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,480
[majestic music]

11
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,080
[Richard] Yep.

12
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,120
So, welcome, everyone, to Zimbabwe.

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,240
[music continues]

14
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,320
And we won't be driving
crummy electric cars either.

15
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,680
Instead, the three of us
decided that we would simply buy

16
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,480
things we've always wanted.

17
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,400
And that's why I bought this.

18
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,240
It's a Triumph Stag.

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,560

[music stops]

21
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,800
I've always loved the Stag.
I've loved it since I was a small boy.

22
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,600
But I never actually thought I'd own one.

23
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,920
To be honest,
I didn't think I was allowed to own one.

24
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,520
Only people like David Niven
could own a Stag.

25
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,920
I'd never even driven one,
in accordance with the rule

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,120
that you should never meet your hero.

27
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,080
But now I have, I'm delighted to say,

28
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,320
it's absolutely lovely.

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,680
Yep.

34
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,880
I am now the proud owner
of a three-litre Mark One Ford Capri.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,800
Is it a GT?

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,520
No, GXL.

37
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,800
-Why didn't you get a GT?
-'Cause this is better.

38
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,240

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,040
Why have you bought a Lancia?

45
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
[Jeremy] Because!

46
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,640
Twenty or so years ago,
I used one to drive across Botswana,

47
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,480
and proved
it was the ideal car for Africa.

48
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,960
But it broke down all the time.

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,800
Yes, it did.

50
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,320
But, that was front-engined.

51
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,200
This, mid-engined. It's a Montecarlo.

52
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,320
And I've made several modifications
to suit the conditions.

53
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,360
Let me talk you through them, if I may.

54
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,640

55
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,360

00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,360
Delta Integrale headlamps and grill.

60
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,200
And then, Lotus Blue paintwork.

61
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,760
Wow. Does any of that
make it more reliable?

62
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,480
And you know we've been doing this for...

63
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,640

64
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,320
Yeah, 112 years.
I've learned a few lessons.

65
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,600
So, inside,

66
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,200
I have replaced the leather seats,
which get hot, with cloth seats.

67
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,480
[Richard] Yes.

68
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,040

of Alcantara racing steering wheel.

69
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,120
And, if you look down there,

70
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,120
I've removed the glove box
and replaced it with...

71
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,920
-[Richard] Is that a fridge?
-[Jeremy] Yes.

72
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,640
For my cold beverages.
For my zesty drink fridge.

73
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,240
-[James] Wow.
-[Richard] That is actually quite good.

74
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,640
[James] Does any of that
make it more reliable?

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,200
No, but I'll be more comfortable.

76
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,360
You will have a cold drink
whilst you wait at the side of the road.

more bearable.

78

-[James] No, it's pretty.
-[Jeremy] It is absolutely breathtaking.

79
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,360
[James] It's beautiful.

80
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,360
I've modified my Capri too,
before shipping it here.

81
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,920
-[Jeremy] Have you?
-[Richard] I've painted the bonnet black.

82
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,320
Because, look at it, it's beautiful.

83
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,880
-Is it a GT?
-No, GXL.

84
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,720
-Why didn't you get a GT?
-[Richard] 'Cause this is better.

85
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,720
-It isn't.
-[Richard] Well, it is. It's like a GT,

86
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,000
which is good,
but with more, which is better.

87
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,920
-[Jeremy] Mm-hmm.
-What?

88
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,560
[Jeremy] I remember that from the GXL

89
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,320
'cause they had put
the wood-look dashboard in it.

90
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,800
[James] Correct.

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,160
-We've discussed this in the past.
-We have.

92
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,680
The GT is for sport,
the GXL is for meetings.

93
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,880
This is exactly right. You need
to understand your Ford-badge hierarchy.

because he was a managing director.

from the very top of the tree.

-None whatsoever.

it's still got the original engine?

00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,920
[James] It has.

118
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,040
Mr Clarkson raises a good point there!

119
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,600
It's not every single Stag,

120
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,000
but most Stags, I would guess,
have had the original engine taken out

121
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,400
and the Rover V8 put in.

122
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,720
-[James] Yes.
-Which is more reliable.

123
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,160
Yeah. The original Triumph Stag V8
is incredible

124
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,720
because it's found
so many ways of overheating

125
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,920
and destroying itself,
'cause it's not just one.

126
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,120
Casting sand left in the blocks fills
the galleyways and then, bang, overheats.

127
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,080
They overbored it. They bored it out
which made all the waterways smaller.

128
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,760
-So it overheats and goes back.
-Yeah. That's two ways.

129
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,040
The clever thing is,
two banks of cylinders.

130
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,000
-[Jeremy] Yeah.
-V8.

131
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,880
They only put a temperature sender
on one bank.

132
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,840
So at least you don't know
when it's overheating.

133
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,040
So if the other bank overheated,
the first you'd know of it was the bang.

134
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,360
-If you're on an aeroplane.
-Yeah.

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,720
-[Richard] Would you want to know?
-Actually, probably not.

137
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,920
[Richard] Why would you wanna know?

138
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,960
You're having your gin and tonic,
watching a movie, having a nice time...

Boom. Nothing...

I don't wanna raise that submarine,
'cause that's sick. They didn't know!

At least it's the last programme
we'll ever do!

-Well, I mean...
-We don't give a [bleeped] anymore!

143
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,720
How much solace did we take
from the fact that they didn't know?

144
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,960
It was, "Oh, we're having a nice time
under the sea..." Boom.

145

Yeah, exactly.

146

You can write, call us,
by all means, to complain.

147

"We are not interested in your call."

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,120
And it doesn't matter anyway,
because, actually,

171
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,200
we've already worked out
a challenge on our own.

172
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,640
We are currently
on the far eastern side of Zimbabwe,

173
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,280
and we're gonna travel
1,200 miles to the far western side.

174
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
And that's it.

175
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,840
That's it!

176
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,480
-Just one thing still concerns me.
-What?

177

[Richard] Mountains? All that.

178
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,640
[Jeremy] Well, I'm not worried because,
let's not forget,

179
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,120
this spawned the 037 Lancia,

180
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,120
which was the last two-wheel-drive car
to win the World Rally Championship,

181
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,600
beating the Audi Quattro.

182
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,440
There wasn't a lot of that in it,
was there?

183
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,760
Well...

184
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,640
What they actually did was
they said we can make this the basis

185
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
of a fantastic rally car
with a few modifications,

186
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,640
and they cut the badge off there,

187
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,000
and then everything
from there backwards was new.

192

[music continues]

194
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,840
[Richard] This is the perfect car
for me to take on this trip.

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,440
My first car was nearly a Capri.

196
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,960
It was advertised in the local paper.

197
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,640
I kept the picture of it next to the till

198
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,120
in the petrol station
where I worked in Ripon.

199
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,040
I was just coming on 18.

200
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,600
It was gonna be my first car.
My parents were buying it for me.

201
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,640
But when we inspected it,

202
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,720
it turned out to have been stolen.

203
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,280
So I got
an old 1976 Toyota Corolla instead.

204
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,000
For a trip like this,
this car is perfect. It's light.

205
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,720
It's just a shade over a metric ton.

206
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,720

Back in the 80s, I never used to drive
into Central London on the M4 motorway.

215
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,600
I always used
the old Great West Road instead,

216
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,640
because on the Great West Road,

217
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,960
there was a car dealership
called the Chequered Flag

218
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,640
and sometimes in the window,
they'd have a Montecarlo.

219

I'd pull over and stare at it,

Stop. Stop whenever we want.
Mr Wilman's not here. Brilliant.

342
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,280
No point driving beyond...
Well, it's four o'clock now.

346
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,800
I don't imagine this'll be
the best hotel in the world.

347
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,080
I mean, we are in the middle of Zimbabwe,

348
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,200
in the middle of a forest
on top of a mountain.

349
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,560
But, you know...

350
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,200
[Jeremy] <i>Thankfully, I was wrong.</i>

351
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,160
<i>Very wrong.</i>

352
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,960
[soft music]

353
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,280
[Jeremy] It's even
a perfect temperature, isn't it?

354
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,480
[James] Hmm...

355
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,320
-[Jeremy] It's pretty special, isn't it?
-[James] It's not bad.

356
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,480
[Jeremy] You see those mountains there,
the far ones? They're Mozambique.

357
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,920
There was always a reason
why we couldn't come to Zimbabwe.

358
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,800
All those years we were at the BBC,

359
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,880
you couldn't come here
because the BBC was banned.

360
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,080
Yeah.

361
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,680
'Cause if you think about today,
we got up in a very agreeable place.

362
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,080
-[James] Mm-hmm.
-Drove on a very agreeable road.

363
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,520
-Yep.
-[Jeremy] To a very agreeable hotel.

364
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,800
It's better than Mr Wilman's idea,
isn't it?

365
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,320
Why have we listened to him
all these years?

366
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,480
[James] I don't know.

367
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,320
Although he will argue that,
without his presence,

368
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,240
two of the cars went wrong
within the first 25 miles.

369
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,560
[Jeremy] <i>That, then, got us nattering
about our cars' stats.</i>

370
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,040
I was quite surprised how much we paid.

371
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,080
You paid, James May,
as I'm sure you know, 26,500 pounds.

372
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,320
I did.

373
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:25,320
Richard Hammond, for his GXL,
the wrong Capri, 25,000 pounds.

374
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,560
-Really?
-[Jeremy] 25 for a GXL.

375
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,920
For a knackered Capri?

376
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,440
-Montecarlo.
-Mm-hmm?

377
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
79,050.

378
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,320
-Bargain.
-[Jeremy] That is a bargain.

379
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,440
Ours are 0 to 60,
in give or take nine seconds.

380
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,400
Hammond's, give or take eight seconds.

381
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,880
-Well, not at the moment.
-[Jeremy] No.

[Richard] <i>Happily,
I was now on the move.</i>

383
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,560
<i>But on the dirt road,
I was starting to worry</i>

384
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,280

hadn't been the wisest choice.</i>

[Richard] Ah!

387
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,800
That was a bit groundy-outy.

388
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,280
[Richard] With hindsight,

389
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,400
I should have gone for something
with better ground clearance

390
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,920
than a 1974 three-litre
Ford Capri Mark One GXL.

391
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,240
And that would include pretty
much anything, as it turns out.

507
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,440
And we would go silent
as we walked past it out of respect.

508
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,880
And, the really good thing is,
from your point of view,

509
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,840
the engine from this,

510
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,680
as we know because almost every Stag
owner in the world has already done it,

511
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,720
fits perfectly into your car.

512
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,600
Can I suggest a modification
that you and I, Jeremy, make to this car?

513
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,600
Mm-hmm?

514
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,360
A little padlock on the bonnet.

515
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,600
[Richard] Just so that...
We'll have the key.

516
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,560
When you need the engine,
which you will, ask.

517
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,160
Or we could find the man
who did this bit of welding.

518
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,560
-[Richard] It's beautiful.
-[James] Ooh, that's good.

519
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,360
[Jeremy] And weld the bonnet shut.

520
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,520
-Actually, that's probably the factory.
-[Jeremy laughing]

521
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,120
Yeah, probably
how it came out of Longbridge!

522
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,200
[in a Birmingham accent]
"I think I'll finish that now, hey."

523
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,920
[in a Birmingham accent]
"You can't see it. Look. Gone."

524
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,000
[epic music]

525
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,600
[James] <i>With Golden Glory
taking up the rear,</i>

526
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,640
<i>we set off west once more
in our quest to get over the mountains.</i>

527
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,400
[tense music]

528
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,800
[men chanting]

529
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,560
[James] Hey, look at this.
These are road-repair people

530
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,800
but they're having an impromptu
sort of dance-club thing.

531
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,960
I wish road workers
back at home did that.

532
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,080
But I suppose they'd have
to be there to start with, wouldn't they?

533
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,000
[tense music]

534
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,520
It's going down a bit now.

535
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,920
[Jeremy] <i>Having done a bit of paddling,
we started to climb.</i>

536
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,040
<i>And the incredible
Zimbabwean landscape changed once again.</i>

537
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,440
Look at that, meadows. You expect
to see cows with bells on them.

538
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,760
And Julie Andrews, giving it "Doe A Deer"
and all the rest of it.

539
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,640
So we've done tea plantation

540
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,600
and now we're in Austria.

541
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,960
[epic music]

542
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,160
[Jeremy] <i>Then, it changed again.</i>

543
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,840
What? Hold on a minute.

544
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,080
To my right,

545
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,920
the most spectacular valley
I've ever seen in my life.

546
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
To my left...

547
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,800
Ireland.

548
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,840
[music continues]

549
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,040
I know what happened.

550
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,560
God had done
all the other countries in the world

551
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,880
and he'd got to the end of the alphabet,
he got to Z,

552
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,840
he got to Zimbabwe,

553
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,640
and he thought,
right, this is gonna be my best work,

554
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,360
this is gonna be my greatest hits.

555
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,960
You've got "Your Song",
"Tiny Dancer", "Bennie and the Jets".

556
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,800
It's stunning.

557
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,920
And it just changes all the time.

558
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,520
[epic music]

559
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,000
[Richard] <i>Sadly, in my low-slung Capri,
I couldn't look at the view</i>

560
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,120
<i>because I was too busy
looking at the road surface.</i>

561
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,600
[grunting]

562
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,320
[rumbling]

563
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,960
They didn't drive Capris this way
in <i>The Professionals,</i> as I recall.

564
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,920
It was all a bit more lively.

565
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,520
[Richard grunting]

566
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,040
I'm enjoying this. It's fun.
You know, it's what I wanna do.

567
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,920
Oh my God, look at that one.

568
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,280
[grunting]

569
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,960
[Jeremy] <i>I was suffering
none of Hammond's problems</i>

570
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,240
<i>because my little Lancia
had been a sensible choice.</i>

571
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,840
[engine purring]

572
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:15,560
This really is the ideal car
for rough-road African exploration

573
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,440
because the engine is behind me,

574
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,800
so there's no prop shaft,
there are no exhausts,

575
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,640
there's nothing
to snag on the road surface.

576
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,640
[Jeremy] <i>I could therefore push on
at a respectable lick...</i>

577
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,960
<i>until something
did snag on the road surface.</i>

578
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,360
-[banging]
-Oh. F...[bleeped] hell.

579
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,040
That was a big one.

580
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,040
What is that?

581
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,120
These are bits of Lancia. Oh, joy!

582
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,000
[Richard chuckling]

583
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,400
Thank you, thank you. I needed that.

584
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,120
I do need that. Thank you.

585
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,480
[James] Oh...

586
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,400
Do you not want us to go down the front?

587
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,880
No, there's nothing to see
at the front of my car.

588
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,520
Because there's no front of your car!

589
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,440
But this is all I need.

590
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,080
With a bit of superglue.
'Cause we're tenting tonight.

591
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,480
Nothing to do when you're tenting
other than glue your car back together.

592
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,040
[Richard] <i>We continued onwards.</i>

593
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,360
-[rattling]
-Oh, God.

594
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,480
Wow, that was a thumb breaker.

595
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,440
[Richard] <i>And then, once again,
we stopped continuing onwards.</i>

596
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,400
-[rattling]
-Oh, [bleeped].

597
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,160
[Richard] Oh no.

598
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,000
[metal rattling]

599
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,920
[Richard over radio]
<i>I think my exhaust has come off again.</i>

600
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,960
[James chuckling]

601
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,600
[James] Having a spot of bother, sir?

602
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,040
That is an extended exhaust system.

603
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,400
[James] Very low. You'll catch that
on the ground if you're not careful.

604
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,360
Why can't you just drive up the road
like the rest of us are?

605
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,720
I can't drive with it like that.
I need to remove it.

606
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,080
[Jeremy] Have you played your Capri
music, would that cheer you up?

607
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,240
♪ <i>Ba, ba, Ford Capri</i> ♪

608
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,520
"It's got everything I need
except the exhaust pipe."

609
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,480
[Jeremy laughing]

610
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,040
[Richard] I need, I'm gonna say,
a 11 mm spanner.

611
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,240
[Jeremy] Oh, now, hang on.

612
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,240
I've got some antibiotics,

613
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,760
for something I don't have any more.

614
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,560
-[Richard] I don't think...
-[Jeremy] I've got this, Hammond.

615
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,720
-Bernie Taupin's autobiography.
-I've heard that's really good.

616
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,480
Very good. I'm reading it.
Would that help you?

617
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,720
[Richard] I don't think
it would actually help, no.

618
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,720
I'm gonna say, again, 11 mm spanner.

619

[clanking]

620
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,920
What's particularly irritating is

621
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,000
this car was in brilliant condition
when I bought it.

622
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,720
-[Jeremy] Yes!
-[Richard] I mean, genuinely.

623
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,920
-[Jeremy] So was that Rimac.
-[Richard and James laughing]

624
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,320
[James] Low blow. Very good.

625
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,360
That was a bit harsh!
But I can't deny it's true.

626
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,600
It was, yeah, until then.

627
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,640
[James] <i>Eager to reach
the top of the mountain before nightfall,</i>

628
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,760
<i>we left our colleague behind.</i>

629
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,160
Honestly, if Richard Hammond
was a block of flats, he'd be condemned.

630

636

We started at 6,000 feet.
We must be pushing 7,000 or 8,000 now.

637
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,000
Agh! I can't even get it into second.
It's so steep.

-[clanking]
-[Jeremy grunting]

639
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,280
I mean, the fact of the matter is,
if you drive relentlessly uphill

640
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,840
in first gear

641
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,320
at the beginning of the African summer,

642
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,800
a car is likely to overheat.
And it is...

Right. Erm, I fixed it.

Well, when I say "fixed",
quite a lot of it...

Oh. Oh, I'm sorry...

[in an Essex accent]
Let's go.

654
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,880
[Richard] Ooh.

655
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,760
Get you to camp this evening.

656
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,640
We can have
a nice old session putting you right.

657
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,640
Oof!

was missing another sunset,</i>

-Cheers.

Oh. That's nice.

a refreshing golden-hour beer,</i>

the Lancia's face.</i>

[James] This is like watching a dog
try to learn a card trick.

667

A little bit of glue
and this is literally as good as new.

Hammond reached our campsite,</i>

[James laughing]

674
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,280
[Jeremy] 22 years. You'd think
we'd know how to do it. But no.

675
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,640
Here he comes.

676
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,800
With one and a half headlamps!

677
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,320
[Richard] Essex is here!

678
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,840
[James] <i>Hammond, however,
wasn't the only one having problems.</i>

679
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,280
[Richard] Were you having a nice moment?

680
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,200
Well, no, I'm not having
a very nice moment.

681
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,960
[James] No, he's glued his finger
to the table.

682
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,600
[Jeremy] I've glued myself
to the table with superglue.

683
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,560
[Richard] Yeah?

684
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,960
[Jeremy] How do you drive
a Lancia Montecarlo

685
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,480
when you've got a table glued
to your finger?

686
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,960
Are you going to glue... Oh, I see!

687
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,080
[James] You could slide a razor blade

688
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
between your finger and the table.
It's a bit risky.

689
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,760
-[Jeremy] Can you?
-[James] Yeah.

690
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,880
But very carefully.
Would you like me to do it for you?

691
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,000
James, he's glued the tip of his finger.

692
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,280
[Jeremy] No, my fingerprint.

693
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,080
[James] Well, it's the sort of pad.

694
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,440
So if you cut it at the first joint...

695
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,280
-[Jeremy] Thank you, Hammond.
-Have I misunderstood?

696
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,480
[James] Then we could graft
a biro onto it.

697
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,560
-[Richard] Lovely.
-Then he'd always have a pen.

698
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,640
Or a bottle opener!
[laughing]

699
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,520
-[Richard and James laughing]
-I'm not listening to you.

700
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,880
[laughing]
Replace it with a corkscrew!

701
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,960
[James] Opener o'nuckle.

702
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,160
"Oh, brilliant."
[Richard imitating a corkscrew]

703
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,600
Doink.
[laughing]

704
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,360
This is the first time I've ever glued
anything to anything, ever.

705
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,800
I'll get this off.
Can we just cut, please?

706
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,480
-Yeah, I can cut.
-Ooh. Interesting.

707
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,360
-I can cut.
-Give me that. Give me that.

708
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,080
It's Mark Sowerman's new knife.
He's very, very proud of it.

709
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,040
-[Jeremy] Yes, I'm not interested.
-It's incredibly sharp.

710
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,000
[Jeremy] Good.

711
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,800
How sharp is... Ooh.

712
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,200
Yes, it's... "Ooh", it is.

713
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,080
-[Richard] Ah, but look how much...
[Jeremy] Ah-ha, this is working!

714
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,520
Do we look like one of those Dutch
paintings with businessmen in big hats?

715
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,200
It's working. It's working.

716
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,760
-[Jeremy] Look.
-[James] This is in the trailer.

717
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,840
Definitely.

718
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,640
-[Jeremy] Look at that!
-[James] Yes! There you go!

719
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,360
[Richard] A grown man unglued his finger
from the table.

720
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,480
[Jeremy] Mark?
I've glued your knife to the table.

721
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,840
[soft music]

722
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,520
[Jeremy] <i>The next morning, after
a terrible and cold night under canvas,</i>

723
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,600
<i>I proudly showed off my workmanship.</i>

724
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,680
Look how well a job I've done there.

725
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,080
[James] I thought you'd got
a new part from a shop.

726
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,680
-[Richard] Where is the repair?
-[Jeremy] The brackets that hold it on.

727
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,160
-Yes?
-They're brok-ed.

728
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,360
So I need to find some place
where I can buy

729
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,400
basically new brackets and bolts and
things to get it fastened back on again.

730
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,080
[soft country music]

731
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,440
[rattling]

732
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,320
I feel I ought to apologise, viewers,
for having a slightly boring car.

733
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,200
The others spend their evenings,
you know, putting exhaust pipes back on,

734
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,040
making a jigsaw puzzle
out of a front bumper.

735
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,480
All I can really do
is give mine a bit of a clean.

736
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,680
[music continues]

737
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,480
[Jeremy] <i>Still,
at least we were now going downhill.</i>

738
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,320
<i>And soon, things got even better.</i>

739
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,080
[Jeremy] Oh yes.

740
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,120
Look at this.

741
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,640
Look at it.

742
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,040
Oh!

743
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,280
There is a God.

744
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,360
And God has provided tarmac.

745
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,560
[soft music]

746
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,400
It's good 'cause now we're on a road
we can actually look at...

747
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,960
Why did my windscreen wipers go on then?

748
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,280
[Jeremy] <i>What this meant is
we'd crossed the Irish Alps</i>

749
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,080
<i>and entered actual Africa.</i>

750
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,360
[Jeremy] It's completely changed again,
the terrain.

751
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,640
Look at that.

752
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,920
Jesus wept, it's pretty.

753
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,680
We're on a <i>Star Trek</i> set now.
Oh, look at the red...

754
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,400
Look at that acacia with the red flowers.

755
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,040
[Jeremy] <i>And then
we saw something even better.</i>

756
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,040
Ooh!

757
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,880
[Richard] I love a scrapyard.

758
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,920
[Jeremy] <i>We pulled in to see
if they had the spare parts we needed.</i>

759
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,280
<i>But soon we were distracted
by all the treasures.</i>

760
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,080
[Jeremy] This is a very good test
of our motoring knowledge.

761
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,480
[James] Is that a Cresta behind that?

762
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,960
[Jeremy] I think it is.
A Cresta shooting brake.

763
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,640
[James] Shooting brake.

764
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,400
[Jeremy] As my mother
always used to call them.

765
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,480
In what special
did you drive one of these?

766
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,400
-Bolivia! Yeah!
-[James] He's right.

767
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,160
[Jeremy] He's remembered something!

768
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,800
That genuinely is worth restoring.

769
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,640
-[Richard] It's gorgeous.
-[Jeremy] Hey, look at this one.

770
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,200
-That's an Austin Cambridge!
-It is indeed an Austin Cambridge.

771
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,760
[Richard] With writing. What's that? RSR.

772
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,920
That means it was when this was Rhodesia.

773
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,960
-[Jeremy] Oh, is that what it means?
-Yeah, so that's been off the road

774
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,280
-a long time.
-[James] That's been there a while.

775
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,640
[Jeremy] Excuse me?
Are you trying to make this go?

776
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,880
[mechanic] Yeah.

777
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,440
-[Jeremy] Yes?
-Nearly there.

778
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,440
[all laughing]

779
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,960
-[Richard] Good luck.
-Nearly there.

780
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,160
[Richard] Yeah, nearly there.

781
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,200
Erm, you may think it's a joke.

782
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,560
The best-selling car in Zimbabwe

783
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,480
in the sort of 60s was...?

784
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,200
Where do they... It was French.

785
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,360
-Four, Renault Four.
-[Richard] Oh!

786
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,800
-There is one over there.
-Yes, there, look.

787
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,360
[Jeremy] Yeah, Renault Four. Do you know
what the 5th best-selling car was?

788
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,680
-The Lancia Montecarlo?
-It wasn't a Lancia Montecarlo, was it?

789
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,640
-Close.
-I'll bet it was an Alfa Romeo.

790
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,160
Alfa Romeo Giulia.

791
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,160
Was it?

792
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,920
-That's 'cause they made them here.
-They made them in South Africa.

793
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,760
-[James] In South Africa, rather, yeah.
-And a friend of mine's dad

794
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,920
ran the Ford factory in Harare.

795
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,480
And they used to smuggle parts of Alfas

796
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,360
out of South Africa

797
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,480
and then build Alfas
in the Ford factory and sell them!

798
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,520
-As Alfas?
-Yeah, as Alfas.

799
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,280
But they also used to build them
in the French factories here.

800
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,920
There were Alfa Romeos running here
that Alfa Romeo didn't know they'd built.

801
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,280
But all the VIN numbers would be wrong.

802
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,960
VIN numbers, VIN numbers!

803
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,760
I'm just saying.

804
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,000
[soft acoustic music]

805
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,400
[Jeremy] <i>Annoyingly, the scrapyard
didn't have any bumper mounts</i>

806
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,560
<i>for a Lancia Montecarlo</i>

807
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,840
<i>or exhaust brackets for a 1974 Capri GXL.</i>

808
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,200
<i>So Hammond decided
to bodge another repair,</i>

809
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,000
<i>while I took the roof off my Montecarlo.</i>

810
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,920
-[Jeremy] The air con is just useless.
-[James] Is it?

811
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,320
Honestly, it's like being
in the Black Hole of Calcutta in there.

812
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,680
You can't say that.

813
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,200
-[James] Er...
-Why not?

814
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,760
[James] I just don't think you can.

815
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,520
Well, all right, if you object to me
saying the "Black Hole of Calcutta"...

816
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,080
-[James] I don't object to it.
-Not you.

817
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,560
I'm talking to the ladies and gentlemen
at home. If anybody wants to write in

818
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,320
and say they object to that,
you go right ahead.

819
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,920
I'm gone. I'm done.

820
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,440
-[James] Can you just pull the lever?
-Dial...

821
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,560
It's 0800 Off Sod.

822
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,120
Off Sod. And then
you'll get a recorded message saying:

823
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,400
-"We do not value your call."
-Yes, "Your call is not important to us."

824
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,160
[chuckling] "Your call... Your..."

825
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,440
Just pull the lever again 'cause
there's another little latch bit here.

826
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,480
-Here?
-Yeah.

827
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,560
[Jeremy] Look!

828
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,920
-[James] Yes, there you go.
-[Jeremy] The thing has disintegrated.

829
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,520
How did you make...?
And then what happens?

830
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,720
[Jeremy] Well, I think...

831
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,680
[James] Well, why does that bit...?

832
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,200
That doesn't... But how does that...

833
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,480
But why does that bit unlatch then?

834
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,800
-[Jeremy] Do these now just clip back...
-[James] Oh wait. If that goes...

835
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,160
-[Jeremy] Do you think this goes under?
-[James] I do.

836
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,160
-Like that?
-[James] Yeah.

837
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,200
Well, to stop... Oh, I see. Oh.

838
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,240
-[James] Ah!
-[Jeremy] There. No.

839
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,920
-But nearly.
-But possibly.

840
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,200
-There you go.
-Do you think that's...?

841
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,880
And in just 24 minutes,

842
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,640
we've converted the Lancia
Montecarlo into a convertible.

843
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,360
James, thank you for your help.

844
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,000
[Jeremy] <i>We then had a gossip
about our colleague.</i>

845
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,560
Captain Exhaust Pipe is going to attempt,

846
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,080
apparently,
to put straight-through exhausts.

847
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,720
-Oh really?
-Out of the side of the car.

848
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,280
So he'll have basically like stacks,
like a Kenworth truck.

849
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,840
Well, I've got a suggestion.

850
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,680
-[Jeremy] We leave him behind.
-Yes, exactly.

851
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,200
I also don't like people with tattoos.

852
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,120
These fully-grown men
go and draw on themselves.

853
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,520
I've noticed. It's the name
of his programme he does.

854
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,560
<i>The Smallest Cog.</i>
He's had his television...

855
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,240
Well, what happens when that gets canned?

856
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,720
I mean, what if I'd had <i>Top Gear</i>
tattooed on my arm?

857
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,200
[Jeremy] Yes, exactly.

858
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,760
He'll have to cross it out and write

859
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,000
"I'm appearing as Buttons
at Swindon Wyvern."

860
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,400
-Yeah, which is a lot of work.
-Which he will be, one day.

861
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,840
-Write "Buttons."
-Or maybe just "Buttons," yeah.

862
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,160
-Put it there, really.
-[Jeremy laughing] Buttons!

863
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:28,560
[Jeremy] <i>After this,
the Ghosts of Christmas Future set off.</i>

864
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,520
-See you, Hammond.
-Yeah.

865
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,880
[Richard] Bye.

866
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,640
Happy travels.

867
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,600

[people whistling and cheering]

876
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,040
I'm gonna miss driving
through cities like this.

877
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,600
God, they're colourful and fun.

878
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,120
[Jeremy over radio]
<i>Check out the policeman, James.</i>

879
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,640
[Jeremy laughing]
Look at him! He's magnificent!

880
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,560
[Jeremy over radio] <i>Is he having
any effect at all on the traffic?</i>

881
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,720
[James over radio] <i>No,
but he cheers everybody up immensely.</i>

882
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:52,120
[Jeremy] <i>As we headed for
the city centre, we came across a market.</i>

883
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,360
<i>A big one.</i>

00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,680
Jesus, this is enormous.

886
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,200
[Jeremy honking]
Okay!

887
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,760
[Jeremy] <i>And soon, I had an idea.</i>

888
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,640
[Jeremy over radio] <i>Right, as this is
the last time we ever work together,</i>

889
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,160
<i>shall we see
if we can help Richard Hammond</i>

890
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,920
and see if we can actually buy him
an exhaust pipe for his car?

891
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,720
Yeah, okay, why not.

892
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,360
[Jeremy] <i>To speed up the shopping,
I fired up another modification,</i>

any of them will fit a Mark One V6 GXL?</i>

900
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,720

as the ones that are currently on there.

-They have got your names in the paper.
-[Jeremy] Huh?

918
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,520
They have got your names in the paper.

919
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,400
[Jeremy] Oh shit.

920
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,040
[James] We're in the paper? Oh wow!

921
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,120
[Jeremy] We are literally
front-page news.

"<i>Top Gear</i> legends."

923
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,240
-Yeah, look.
-Here we are again.

924
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,920
[Jeremy] You see, "Superstars
who they made their name in <i>Top Gear</i>..."

925
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,480
and then blew it.

926
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,920
"The most recognisable figures
when it comes to motoring on television."

927
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,200
That's a narrow band.

928
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,520
-[James] Yeah, it is a bit.
-[Jeremy chuckling]

929
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,680
[James] Look, this is getting
more promising.

930
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,720
[James] <i>I think it's fair to say
that if our colleague had known</i>

937
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,680
[Richard] Chaps!

938
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,440
-Well done!
-[Jeremy] Have you had a rotten day?

939
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,800
-[Richard] Aw! Thank you.
-I've got you a beer.

940
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,160
But I think more important than that...

941
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,480
And yes, it is a correct set, look.

942
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,240
-For the GXL.
-It is for the GXL.

943
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,360
-I don't wanna be...
-Not the GT.

944
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,160
-Is this a cruel joke?
-[Jeremy and James] No.

945
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,320
-Really?
-[James] Yeah.

946
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,600
[Richard] Oh, my God!

947
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,240
Look what that means!

948
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,960
-Feel that.
-Quiet.

949
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,560
[Jeremy] It means you're getting no sleep
tonight.

950
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,720
[Richard] Oh, I don't care!

951
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,760
Hammond, it doesn't stop there.

952
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,080
-[Richard] What?
-It doesn't stop there.

953
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,320
This is embarrassing now
but I'm very grateful.

954
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,440
Oh, my Lord.

955
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,840
-Oh, my Lord!
-[Jeremy] That's a rear spoiler.

956
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,240
-Not just any rear spoiler.
-No, but a Richard Grant rear...

957
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,080
-You remember Richard Grant spoilers?
-[Richard] The actor?

958
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,640
[Jeremy] No, well...

959
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,200
That's the thing,
the Richard Grant spoilers were on XR2s

960
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,840
all through the 70s and 80s.

961
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,960
Turns out Richard E. Grant,
who did <i>Withnail and I...</i>

962
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,080
-He did!
-[Jeremy] He did. He then started

963
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,800
a car accessory business.

964
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,880
But because he didn't want
to damage his acting career,

965
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,160
he dropped the "E".

966
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,800
[Richard] Chaps, er,

967
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,840
this is genuinely all spectacular news
and I'm very, very happy.

968
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,160
So you can fit that tonight.

969
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,200
[Richard] I feel terrible.
I haven't got you any...

970
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,880
Of course you haven't got me anything.

971
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:25,880
I haven't got you any gifts.

972
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,280
When have you ever,
you two, ever bought me...

973
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,440
You bought me
a shit oil painting in Vietnam.

974
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,800
-It was lovely!
-[Jeremy] Shit.

975
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,360
And you've never bought me anything.

976
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,800
-Have I never bought you anything?
-[Jeremy] Never.

977
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,720
-Have I never bought you a gift?
-[Jeremy] No!

978
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,040
[Jeremy] I bought you a galleon
in Vietnam to put on your motorcycle.

979
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,800
[Jeremy] <i>That night,
we polished our cars,</i>

980
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,520
<i>did all the necessary repairs...</i>

981
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,080
[upbeat music]

982
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,360
<i>And then met up for the sort of breakfast
Mr Wilman never provided.</i>

983
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,240
[Jeremy] Is that my coffee?

984
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,480
[James] Yes.

985
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,200
-You ordered me a coffee?
-Yes.

986
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,320
It's nearly a present.

987
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,880
-Hey.
-What.

988
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,600
I went to the bar last night.

989
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,560
-Yeah?
-Got talking to a man.

990
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,880
And I bought this from him.

991
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,280
-What is it?
-Silver.

992
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,400
Actual silver.

993
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,640
-[James] Is it?
-[Jeremy] Nuggets of it, yes.

994
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,640
60 cents a gram.

995
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,000
'Cause, turns out,
you know we've been driving along...

996
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,640
On the surface there's all
the fruit and crops and so on.

997
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,680
-Yeah.
-Bread basket of Africa.

998
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,200
Dig down...

999
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,600
Gold, silver, manganese, lithium,

1000
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,560
diamonds, coal, iron ore.

1001
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,760
So you're ploughing a field
to get your pineapples in,

1002
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,640
or your tea or your bananas
or whatever it might be,

1003
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,360
and there's just diamonds and lithium.

1004
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,800
-Jewels.
-Yeah, jewels and lithium and cobalt

1005
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,600
just pouring out.

1006
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,400
And I was thinking,
you know people when they go on...

1007
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,680
Well, we go on these trips,
we always go home with a stupid souvenir.

1008
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,000
Well, instead of buying
some crappy nonsense,

1009
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,280
why don't we get some silver?

1010
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,480
-60 cents?
-[Jeremy] 60 cents!

1011
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,520
-[Richard] A gram?
-A gram.

1012
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:09,000
[Jeremy] <i>We then rushed immediately
into town and went shopping.</i>

1013
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,040
<i>And we didn't hold back.</i>

1014
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,040
So this is 45 kilograms of silver.

1015
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,760
-[Richard] The best souvenir ever.
-[Jeremy] I know.

1016
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,480
We could have gone back
with an awful painting of a sunset.

1017
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,160
This is going to affect my weight
distribution, I've gotta be honest.

1018
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,120
[Richard] This is gonna add
to the downforce from my wing.

1019
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,800
[Jeremy] I'm just trying to work out
how much that cost.

1020
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,800
[Richard] Not a lot, according to you.

1021
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,200
-Well, it's sixty cents a gram.
-[Richard] Yes.

1022
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:39,400
But we got a discount on the quantity.
And then the change he gave me was this.

1023
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,200
So I paid in US...

1024
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,240
What is that?

1025
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,840
-50... 50 million?
-Mm-hmm.

1026
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,240
[Jeremy] 50 million dollars.

1027
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,680
When they had really big hyperinflation,
it was a million percent, wasn't it?

1028
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,080
[James] Something like that, yeah.

1029
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,720
And at one point,
I think with a 50 million-dollar note,

1030
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,040
it was cheaper
to wipe your bottom with this

1031
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,440
than it was to use one single sheet
of lavatory paper.

1032
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,320
-[Richard] It was actually cheaper?
-'Cause that was more valuable.

1033
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,160
That's why if people ordered a coffee,
they paid for it when they got it

1034
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,520
rather than after they'd drunk it
'cause it would have gone up.

1035
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,000
-Anyway.
-[Richard] Enough financial matters.

1036
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,040
-So we've got 45 kilograms of silver...
-Yes.

1037
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,080
And 50 million dollars.

1038
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,640
We are in a good place.

1039
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,560
[Jeremy] <i>Having fired up
our fully repaired silver machines,</i>

1040
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,760
<i>we headed out of town,</i>

1041
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:32,680
<i>fairly convinced that no city on earth
gives better avenue.</i>

1042
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,920
[Jeremy over radio]
<i>Those purple trees are breathtaking.</i>

1043
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,080
<i>Are these really Jacaranda trees?</i>

1044
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,680
[Richard over radio] <i>Yeah, they are.
Look at that. They're beautiful.</i>

1045
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,080
[soft music]

1046
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,720
[Jeremy] Oh, look at this.

1047
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,920
That's the most beautiful avenue of trees
I think I've ever seen.

["Love Will Tear Us Apart"

1049
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,360
[Richard] <i>With Jeremy
on map-reading duties,</i>

1050
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:10,240
<i>we headed due west
on a rather brilliant ribbon of tarmac.</i>

1051
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,200
[engine roaring]

1052
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,920
[James] The road is good,
scenery is good,

1053
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,240
things are good.

1054
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,440
[music continues]

1055
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:41,160
[Jeremy] <i>For hours,
the journey was completely trouble-free.</i>

1056
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,520
<i>And it continued to be trouble-free
till I stopped to check the map.</i>

1057
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,160
[honking]

1058
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,080
<i>Then it wasn't trouble-free any more.</i>

1059
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:52,840
[Jeremy] Shit.

1060
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,600
[Richard] Wherefore have you stopped?

1061
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,360
-[Jeremy] Good news.
-Go on.

1062
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,720
Good news. Very good news.

1063
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,440
Er, I know exactly which road we're on.

1064
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:03,920
[Richard stuttering]

1065
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,320
-There is some bad news.
-Yes.

1066
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,320
It's the wrong road.

1067
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,680
-[James] What's happened?
-[Jeremy] We're on the wrong road.

1068
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,440
Who said they knew where they were going?
Oh, I know.

1069
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,520
-Er, was it... I...
-It wasn't you.

1070
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,960
-No, it was like another voice.
-And it wasn't me, was it?

1071
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,720
Let's not get bogged down
in who turned left and who turned right.

1072
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,320
-It was you.
-It was me.

1073
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,680
So, you've got us on the wrong road
leaving Harare.

1074
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,600
[Jeremy] We should be heading west.
We're not. We're heading north.

1075
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,200
-Show me.
-We face a choice. We can either

1076
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,200
go all the way back to Harare.

1077
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,040
-No.
-[Richard laughing]

1078
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,360
And take that turning,
which we should have done.

1079
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,960
-Okay.
-[Jeremy] Or...

1080
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,000
If we keep heading north and then...

1081
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,000
-On the wrong road.
-Yeah.

1082
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,320
If we keep heading north, we will
eventually get to the Zambezi, okay?

1083
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,880
Which is the border with Zambia.

1084
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,640
[Jeremy] Big river. Can't miss it.

1085
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,760
Hang a left, we know we're going west.

1086
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,640
Well, 'cause the river goes
like that and the road goes like that.

1087
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,480
[Jeremy] So, there we are.

1088
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,240
["Love Will Tear Us Apart"

1089
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,880
[Jeremy] <i>Having processed
the fact that instead of doing this,</i>

1090
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,920
<i>we'd been doing this,</i>

1091
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,200
<i>we soldiered on.</i>

1092
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,720
[Jeremy] I think we'll make it
to the Zambezi by nightfall.

1093
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,560
We could camp by the Zambezi.

1094
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,080
How cool would that be?

1095
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,960
[Jeremy] <i>But then...</i>

1096
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,840
<i>the tarmac ran out.</i>

[rattling]

1098
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,560
[Richard grunting] Oh no!

1099
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,240
Oh please, don't let this be washboard.
Oh God!

1100
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,160
It is!

1101
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,200
[Richard grunting] Oh!

1102
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,760
Chaps, it's about 40 miles
to the river now, 40 miles.

1103
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,400
-14 miles?
-[Jeremy over radio] <i>No, no, James.</i>

1104
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,840
<i>40 miles, four zero miles.</i>

1105
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,320
[James over radio] <i>40?</i>

1106
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,200
Yes, I'm afraid
that's about the sum of it, yes.

-[Richard grunting]

[Richard]
They're never gonna hold together.

1109
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,840
-[clanking]
-Oh, that was a really bad bit.

1110
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,680
Oh, wait, I'm stopping. What?

1111
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,440
Chaps, er, I'm breaking down.

1112
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,320
[Jeremy over radio]
<i>It's okay, mine's fine.</i>

1113
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,320
Oh no... I smell fuel.

1114
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,760
First job is put something white on

1115
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:27,400
because the tsetse flies
are attracted to blue and black.

1116
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,960
[Richard] Oh, shit!

1117
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,440
All my petrol is falling out.

1118
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,600
Oh no, that's bad.

1119
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:40,640
This is the fuel pipe,
and this is the fuel.

1120
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,680
[Richard laughing]

1121
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,360
That's your... Thank you.

1122
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,920
-Well...
-What I could do...

1123
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,040
-Is petrol coming out of your hot car?
-Yeah.

1124
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,000
Is this a good idea?

1125
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,080
-[Richard] Yeah.
-[Jeremy] Thank you.

1126
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,920
Would one of you fancy standing here
with their finger on the end of this?

1127
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:54,960
-[James] Not really.
-[Jeremy] No.

1128
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,000
Just try to explain so I can understand.

1129
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,000
It's come off.

1130
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,120
The line from the petrol tank
up to the engine goes to there...

1131
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,880
So there must be a pipe from...
Has it just snapped?

1132
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,720
-[Richard] No, it's come undone.
-[Jeremy] Why are you helping him?

1133
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,280
I want him to survive otherwise we can't
see him as Buttons in the pantomime.

1134
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,520
[Richard] Oh, please!

1135
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,760
Stop it with the Buttons!

1136
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,600
[James] Oh no we won't.

1137
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,320
How long before he is appearing
as Buttons at the Swindon Wyvern?

1138
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,600
-One year.
-[Richard] Please, stop!

1139
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:26,520
No, I think he's got enough pride
to make him last two years.

1140
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,040
So this one goes out in 2024,
this programme,

1141
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,800
so I think it'll be 2025.

1142
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,800
Possibly Guildford.

1143
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,200
God, I'm soaked in petrol!

1144
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,360
Guildford's quite a big theatre, though.

1145
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,640
I know... I think the Swindon Wyvern
is where he's gonna be.

1146
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,920
It's about 200 people.

1147
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,680
The cast, here it is.

1148
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,520
Ainsley Harriott,
Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen,

1149
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,000
Julian Clary, Richard Hammond.

1150
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,000
That is a star-studded line-up.

1151
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,480
[James] "Gloria Hunniford and,
it is a lot of 'and', Richard Hammond..."

1152
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,280
[James and Jeremy] "As Buttons!"

1153
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,280
[Richard laughing]

1154
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:58,080
"Following his illustrious career
travelling the globe."

1155
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,680
[James] Will it say
"TV's Richard Hammond"?

1156
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,640
"TV's", yeah!

1157
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,280
Because he's done enough programmes
for him to be "TV's Richard Hammond."

1158
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,480
I tell you,
Hammond, we're gonna come and see you.

1159
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,200
-[James] I'm gonna say...
-On your first night,

1160
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,880
there will be two elderly gentlemen
in the front row.

1161
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:11,960
Every night.

1162
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,680
I mean, I hate panto
but I'm going to that one.

1163
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,040
Think of the Premier Inn reward points
you're going to get.

1164
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,240
[Richard] Oh God!

1165
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,800
[James] With the Sunday matinee,
you can have the carvery special.

1166
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:23,800
[Jeremy laughing]

1167
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,960
[Jeremy] <i>Predicting
that this wouldn't be the last time</i>

1168
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,720
<i>we'd be standing around a broken Capri,</i>

1169
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,120
<i>I went to put on
my anti-tsetse fly shirt.</i>

1170
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,920
<i>And then, I spotted something
in the undergrowth.</i>

1171
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:41,120
[Jeremy] Ooh, hello. Ooh!

1172
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,840
I've got a bonnet ornament, guys.

1173
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,920
Remember on the old Lancia?

1174
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,680
Oh wow.

1175
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,080
Look at that.

1176
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,080
-[Richard] That's brilliant.
-I know.

1177
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,600
[soft music]

1178
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,640
[Jeremy] <i>Eventually,
Buttons was back on the road.</i>

1179
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,720
I'm just checking my fuel gauge.
I lost a fair bit.

1180
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,880
[Jeremy] <i>And then, with 30 miles to go,</i>

1181
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,760
<i>the washboard became so vicious...</i>

1182
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,120
-[thud]
-[Richard grunting] Oh!

1183
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:12,160
[Jeremy] <i>It even started to play havoc</i>

1184
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,240
<i>with the normally bulletproof Stag.</i>

1185
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,880
The windscreen wipers randomly come on.

1186
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,320
Stop it, windscreen wipers!

1187
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,040
[James grunting]

1188
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,720
Stop wiping the windscreen,
you stupid rubber bastards!

1189
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,720
[windscreen wipers squeaking]

1190
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,240
[James] <i>It was as if the washboard,</i>

1191
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,640
<i>our nemesis for the last 20 years,</i>

1192
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:42,080
<i>knew it was its last chance to break us.</i>

1193
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,400
[rattling]

1194
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,480
[Richard grunting]

1195
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,760
-[clanking]
-Ooh!

1196
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,240
[tense music]

1197
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,320
[rattling]

1198
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,280
It's on full... Christ,
what the hell's happened here?

1199
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,120
I have no throttle control.

1200
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,920
Yeah, my foot's not
on the accelerator now

1201
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,760
and we're just driving along.

1202
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,600
I've put it under the accelerator
to lift it off.

1203
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,040
[rattling and clanking]

1204
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:19,040
This has properly, properly
started to break my Lancia...

1205
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,640
and me.

1206
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,120
Oh, God. Oh no!

1207
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,000
[epic music]

1208
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,800
[Jeremy] <i>However,
despite their great age,</i>

1209
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,680
<i>our cars held together
until eventually...</i>

1210
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,760
<i>we reached the banks of the Zambezi.</i>

1211
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,960
[Jeremy] Oh God.

1212
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:44,520
[Jeremy] <i>Where Mother Nature
had laid on quite a reception.</i>

1213
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,480
[soft music]

1214
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,640
It's not a bad spot.

1215
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,160
[Jeremy] <i>After dinner,
we had a lovely pudding.</i>

1216
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,120
Cheesecake.

1217
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,400
[Jeremy] <i>And, this being Zimbabwe...</i>

1218
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,640
Now, would you like some gold on it?

1219
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,760
-Erm, yeah, I would actually.
-[James] Oh, yes please.

1220
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,600
[Jeremy]
I got it when we were in Harare.

1221
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:40,160
The great thing about it as well is you
do a golden turd the next day.

1222
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,120
-That's true.
-And it becomes valuable.

1223
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,200
This is just extravagant.
Thanks, Hammond.

1224
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,080
-I'm now worth more than I was.
-May?

1225
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,360
-[James] Yes, please.
-[Jeremy] 'Cause if you think about it,

1226
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,080
they grow everything here.
And then you dig a hole in the ground

1227
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,080
for your pudding, which is gold.

1228
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,840
Hey, that gives me an idea.

1229
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,560
-Why don't we melt our silver?
-[James] Hmm.

1230
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,280
And then we can make gift items
to take home with us.

1231
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,400
Out of our souvenir silver?

1232
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,840
-Do you have to make a mould?
-[James] Hmm.

1233
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:11,320
Are you proposing that we do craft?

1234
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:16,280
Well, what else can we do? It's 6:20.

1235
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,640
Drinking is going well.

1236
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,480
[Jeremy] Yes, drinking's good.
But eventually...

1237
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,920
you'll be wrestling a baboon.
You always do that sort of thing.

1238
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:28,080
[Jeremy] <i>In a state of deep joy,</i>

1239
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:32,720
<i>James quickly built all that we needed
to start smelting our silver.</i>

1240
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,320
[Jeremy] He is Victorian.

1241
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,040
-[softly] Very happy.
-[whispering] So happy.

1242
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:48,680
[Jeremy] <i>And two small drinks later,
things were looking good.</i>

1243
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,040
[James] There you go, chaps.
Look at that.

1244
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,040
[Jeremy] Holy cow!

1245
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:58,240
So now we can make anything.
Literally anything that we can cast.

1246
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,480
-Yes, so you make a hole in something.
-[Richard] Yes?

1247
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,280
Pour that in, let it solidify.

1248
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,160
-And then you've got a thing in silver.
-[Jeremy] Right!

1249
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,480
Come on, then.
Gentlemen, let's get to work.

1250
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,560
I'll mend my throttle,
then I'll make something silvery.

1251
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:19,320
Actually, no, I'll make the mould,
put the silver in it, let it solidify.

1252
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,160
-[James] Exactly.
-And while it's solidifying,

1253
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,800
I'll mend my throttle linkage.

1254
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,040
Welcome to a world of ordered thinking.

1255
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,600
[Jeremy] <i>The next morning,</i>

1256
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,720
<i>the banks of the Zambezi were carpeted
with many different animals...</i>

1257
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,800
<i>and Roger Moore.</i>

1258
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,360
[Jeremy] Have you had that made?

1259
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,400
[Richard] Yep.

1260
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,160
And whose measurements did you send?

1261
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,160
-[Jeremy] Jon Bon Jovi's.
-[Richard] I was a little ambitious.

1262
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,120
You know how it is, when the doctor says,
how many units of alcohol do you drink

1263
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,520
and when somebody says:
"What are your measurements?"

1264
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:03,440
"Definitely thirty-inch waist,
forty-inch chest." I lied.

1265
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:06,240
Have you noticed what he's done here?

1266
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,760
-Very flamboyant buttons.
-[James] Buttons, yes.

1267
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,600
It's like he's easing himself
into the role.

1268
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:17,040
Can we just move on
from his sartorial faux pas?

1269
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,680
[James] Isn't it magnificent?

1270
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,080
[Jeremy] Is that what you made
out of your silver?

1271
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,800
-[James] Oh, yeah.
-[Richard] That's startling.

1272
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,640
Why has nobody... Well.
I wonder why nobody's done that before.

1273
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:28,000
Your steering wheel's actually
a solid-silver steering wheel!

1274
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,200
That's another £900,000.

1275
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,200
I mean, it does look pretty cool,
doesn't it?

1276
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,880
But, talking of bling. Bonnet ornament.

1277
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:36,880
-[James] Is it the bonnet?
-[Richard] It's not on the bonnet though.

1278
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,560
[Jeremy] It is on... But you see...
Ah, but it is the bonnet.

1279
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,280
[Richard] This is at the back. Does it
become an engine cover, not a bonnet?

1280
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,920
-You can't say "engine cover ornament".
-No, you can't.

1281
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:49,040
-[Richard] I love it. It looks brilliant.
-[Jeremy] I mean, look at that.

1282
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,760
That is an impala on a Montecarlo.

1283
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,800
So I'm basically
a Chevrolet advertisement.

1284
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,160
Isn't it remarkable
what makes sense in our world?

1285
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,120
-What?
-That doesn't.

1286
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:01,200
-[James] I saw it as I looked up then.
-[Richard] Check it out. Come on.

1287
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,680
<i>Stuart Little</i> spoiler,
ladies and gentlemen.

1288
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,840
[Richard] Oh, the width, yeah.
That's all the silver I had.

1289
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:09,400
It's quite... It's <i>Stuart Little</i> spoiler!

1290
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,120
[Jeremy chuckles]

1291
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,360
Anyway...

1292
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:13,960
we now have

1293
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,400
silver adornments

1294
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:16,960
to our cars.

1295
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,320
-Can I make a suggestion?
-[James] Hmm?

1296
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,960
Keep the river on your right.

1297
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,640
It's not
navigationally challenging, is it?

1298
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,040
Navigation is not a problem today.

1299
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,960
-And we know we are heading West.
-[Richard] Yes.

1300
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,120
And we know if we keep heading West,
we'll get to the other side of Zimbabwe.

1301
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,720
And we know we're gonna look good
doing it!

1302
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,480
[soft rock music]

1303
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,360
[engine revving]

1304
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,880
[engine roaring]

1305
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,080
[chuckling]

1306
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,080
[Jeremy] A big skid!

1307
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,680
A big skid on the Zambezi.

1308
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:15,640
That might be
my last-ever televised skid.

1309
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,680
It's strange when you think about it,

1310
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,280
because everybody
does everything in their life

1311
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,560
for the last time at some point.

1312
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,120
The last time you dive off a boat.

1313
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,720
The last time you kick a football.

1314
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,000
The last time you do sex.

1315
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:33,320
But you don't know, when you're doing it,

1316
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,680
that you're doing it for the last time.

1317
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,800
So I shall remember that skid.

1318
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:46,720
[Jeremy] <i>After a spirited
morning drive...</i>

1319
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,680
[upbeat music]

1320
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,800
<i>we got back on tarmac.</i>

1321
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,560
<i>Which had yellow lines and everything.</i>

1322
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,280
This is like the Stelvio Pass.

1323
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,040
What a road!

1324
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,160
[Jeremy] <i>And the little Montecarlo
was lapping it up.</i>

1325
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:11,960
I've said it before,

1326
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:16,000
if you absolutely must do
African exploration,

1327
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:20,280
you absolutely must have a Lancia.

1328
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,800
Oh, it's jumped out of gear.

1329
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,280
Oh, God, it's back in again.

1330
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,920
Still popping and banging nicely
from the back. Can you hear that?

1331
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,520
[Jeremy rumbling]

1332
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:37,920
[rumbling]

1333
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,200
Love that sound.

1334
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,520
And all you lot growing up today
with your electric cars,

1335
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,400
you're never gonna hear it.

1336
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,400
[engine roaring]

1337
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,880
There are lots of reasons
why we're jacking this show in.

1338
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,600
But for me, one of the main ones is:

1339
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:57,920
I'm simply not interested
in electric cars.

1340
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,240
They are just white goods.

1341
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,520
They're washing machines.
They're microwave ovens.

1342
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,320
And you can't review those.
You can't enjoy them.

1343
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,000
They are just shit.

1344
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:14,440
[James on radio] <i>Chaps, I've done
something for the first time in my life.</i>

1345
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,600
[Jeremy on radio]
<i>Masturbated on television?</i>

1346
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,760
No, it's worse. I've put on
a pair of string-back driving gloves.

1347
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,560
Why have you done that?

1348
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,680
My silver-bling steering wheel is great.

1349
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,160
But now the sun's on it,
it gets a bit hot.

1350
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,240
[laughing]

1351
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,680
[Jeremy] <i>We carried on driving
along the lovely road</i>

1352
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:40,200
<i>until the lovely road suddenly stopped.</i>

1353
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:42,760
Erm...

1354
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:44,880
Oh.

1355
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,840
[tense music]

1356
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,400
Hmm.

1357
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:01,440
[Richard] You total plum sack.

1358
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,560
[Jeremy] It's a lake.

1359
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:03,520
-[Richard] Yes.
-[James] Is it?

1360
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,280
-[Jeremy] Well, I saw it on...
-[James] You're kidding?

1361
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:06,880
[Jeremy] I saw it on the map.

1362
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,640
I just assumed there'd be
a road round it and there isn't.

1363
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,560
Erm...

1364
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:14,800
Why isn't there a road round it?

1365
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,760
[Richard] Oh, God.

1366
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,920
So, wait a minute. You went wrong
in Harare. Let's establish that.

1367
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,240
You chose the wrong road. There were
only two, you chose the wrong one.

1368
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,800
You then doggedly made us...

1369
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,680
[Jeremy] Beautiful bit,
like the Nürburgring, that last bit.

1370
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,280
Nice bit at the end.
But it turned out to be the end.

1371
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,760
We can't turn right because literally,
just there, it's Zambia.

1372
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,200
-[James] Mm-hmm.
-[Richard] Yes.

1373
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:47,000
-We can't go left.
-'Cause there isn't a road.

1374
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,160
-There isn't a road.
-Yes.

1375
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,320
[Jeremy] So...

1376
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,800
-We'll just float across.
-Don't be ridiculous.

1377
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,320
Honestly, we've done enough car boats,
boat cars, flasks, floating.

1378
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,520
We're not building boats. It never works.

1379
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:05,000
I've got a better idea:
buy a boat. Buy three boats.

1380
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,200
-We've got to get the cars on.
-[Jeremy] Yes, exactly.

1381
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,680
-Buy boats?
-They've got boats. Look.

1382
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,920
-[Richard] They're peoples' boats.
-[Jeremy] Well, we'll buy them.

1383
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,840
I've got a wedge.

1384
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,520
Ten trillion.

1385
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,360
-Fifty billion?
-[Richard] Yeah, why not?

1386
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:19,320
[James] Yeah,
I'll have another fifty billion.

1387
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,160
A hundred billion.
Three hundred and fifty billion.

1388
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,240
-Four hundred billion.
-[Jeremy laughs]

1389
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:28,240
Ten trillion
four hundred billion and twenty.

1390
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,200
-[Jeremy and Richard laughing]
-[James] This is absolutely idiotic.

1391
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,560
Right. Boat buying.

1392
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:33,760
[upbeat music]

1393
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:41,240
[Richard] <i>Having spent the morning
rootling around the local boatyards,</i>

1394
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,360
<i>we reconvened with our purchases.</i>

1395
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:48,000
<i>James had gone
for an old sardine fishing boat.</i>

1396
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,880
<i>I'd bought an aquatic hatchback.</i>

1397
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,760
<i>And Jeremy, naturally,</i>

1398
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:57,920
<i>had purchased a floating drinks cabinet.</i>

1399
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,320
[Richard] You've bought a bar.

1400
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,280
-It's also the bridge.
-Oh, I see!

1401
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,880
[Jeremy] You steer it from the bar.

1402
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,920
[Richard] <i>Once we'd loaded up our cars...</i>

1403
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,840
[Jeremy laughing]

1404
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:13,920
[panting]

1405
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,160
[Richard] To me!

1406
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:19,120
[Richard] <i>We assembled
on HMS Sardine for a map chat.</i>

1407
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,040
[Richard] Are they nautical charts?

1408
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,600
No, it's a road map.

1409
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,520
Right, we're going to sea
with a road map.

1410
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,560
-So here's the lake.
-Yes.

1411
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:29,000
We're going to...

1412
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,000
What?

1413
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,080
-Here's the lake.
-[Richard] Yes. Here's the lake.

1414
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,000
-[Richard] What's that?
-[James] Bloody hell.

1415
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,800
That's the rest.

1416
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,320
Yes.

1417
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,680
That goes to there.

1418
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,160
Okay.

1419
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,440
It's about 180 miles.

1420
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,920
It's a 175 miles.

1421
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,200
That's all right, then!

1422
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,720
Right, thank God we haven't got
to do that extra 5 miles.

1423
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:00,840
It's the world's largest
man-made lake.

1424
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,040
I am genuinely sorry about this.

1425
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,880
I had looked at...
Look, you can see the problem.

1426
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,200
We've driven all the way, I've just
been using this side of the map.

1427
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,200
No, no, no, Jeremy,
we can see the problem.

1428
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,640
It's there, pointing at the map.

1429
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,640
-[James] The map is accurate.
-There's no problem with the map.

1430
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,320
-You didn't look at the other side.
-But it was all folded up in such a way

1431
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,720
that you didn't see...

1432
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,960
How fast does your boat go?

1433
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,880
Well, I don't know yet.
But not very I'm gonna guess.

1434
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,760
I think we're talking about a brisk walk.

1435
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,080
Even if they do ten knots,
which I doubt...

1436
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:32,800
Let's say 10 miles an hour.
That's eighteen hours.

1437
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,400
That's overnight.

1438
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:35,840
Yes.

1439
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,400
[Jeremy] <i>I then did a bit more research.</i>

1440
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,880
<i>And that wasn't a great move either.</i>

1441
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,320
It gets worse.

1442
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,840
Why?

1443
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,320
[Jeremy] Guess how many crocodiles
are in that lake?

1444
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,960
[Richard] I don't know.

1445
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,960
Somewhere between one hundred
and two hundred and fifty thousand.

1446
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,160
[Richard] Crocodiles?

1447
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,400
[Jeremy] Two weeks ago,
they had to shoot a man-eater.

1448
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,080
Would you like to see it?

1449
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:04,440
[James] Jeez, that is...

1450
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,680
[Richard] Look at it!

1451
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,120
-[James] Can they be this big?
-[Richard] It could eat this boat.

1452
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:13,320
On average, 47 people a year
are killed by crocodiles.

1453
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:16,720
And there aren't that many people here,
to start with.

1454
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,840
[tense rock music]

1455
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,840
[Jeremy] <i>On that sombre note,</i>

1456
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:27,520
<i>we set off...</i>

1457
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,920
HMS Shitfaced is underway.

1458
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:39,240
[Jeremy] <i>Under the watchful eye
of the lake's residents.</i>

1459
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,080
I think of this not so much as water
as just a solid lump of crocodiles.

1460
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,000
[rock music continues]

1461
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:57,560
Right. Safety checks complete.

1462
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,840
There's only one thing I can think to do.

1463
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,920
I believe Jeremy's
already poured himself a drink.

1464
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:09,120
-[bang]
-Mr Slowly driving HMS Eco.

1465
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,080
[engine sputtering loudly]

1466
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,960
What a bloody racket!

1467
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:27,440
It's extraordinary to think that in 1955,

1468
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,280
this didn't exist,
it was just normal Africa.

1469
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,960
Then the British came and said : "We're
gonna build a dam across the Zambezi

1470
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:40,240
to create hydroelectric power
for Zambia and Zimbabwe."

1471
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,800
And this was the result.

1472
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,320
[soft music]

1473
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:54,080
The biggest man-made lake
the world has ever seen.

1474
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:12,160
We've done some daft things in our time,
but I'm really enjoying this one.

1475
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,520
I'm sailing a bar with a Lancia on it.

1476
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,640
And I've got a lot of drink
to get through.

1477
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:25,960
[Jeremy] <i>So much, in fact, that I invited
Buttons and Greta Thunberg over...</i>

1478
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,440
[engine sputtering]

1479
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,040
<i>...to share the workload.</i>

1480
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,880
-[Jeremy] Gentlemen.
-[James] I like the look of that.

1481
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,960
I've a wide range of drinks
from the 1970s,

1482
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,800
including the much-missed Galliano.

1483
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,120
-[James] Nice.
-[Richard] Nice. A step back in time.

1484
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,720
-A gin and tonic, sir?
-I would love a gin and tonic, thank you.

1485
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,160
Coming right up.
And you, sir? A Chablis, I'm guessing.

1486
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:47,320
[cork popping]

1487
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,440
[James] Thank you.

1488
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,320
Ice and a slice of gold, perhaps?

1489
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:52,200
[Richard] Ice and a slice of gold
would be wonderful.

1490
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,320
So if you go in that water, basically,
you are going to be eaten by a crocodile.

1491
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:59,320
-[Jeremy] Yeah.
-[James] Yeah.

1492
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:04,160
And I can't think of a death
I would enjoy less.

1493
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:07,240
Yeah, it's not the agony, actually.
Well, no.

1494
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,760
-It is the agony. But it's the indignity.
-[Richard] It is the agony.

1495
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,640
It's ignominium.

1496
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:15,520
Crocodile comes along. You're there,
dangling your feet in the water,

1497
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:19,520
thinking about life, filled with hopes,
expectations, loves, dreams,

1498
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,200
thoughts of the universe.

1499
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,640
Crocodile says: "I'll have that."
Bang. Gone.

1500
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,720
-You know peanuts on a bar?
-[Richard] Yeah.

1501
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,960
You're having a drink with some friends
and you see some peanuts.

1502
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,120
You take a couple of peanuts and you...

1503
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,720
That is what you are.

1504
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,920
[James] Do you know what makes it worse?

1505
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,560
A crocodile is prehistoric.

1506
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,640
So it was mates with T-Rex.

1507
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,840
It's two 250 million years old.

1508
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,880
And humanity's what?
150, 200 thousand?

1509
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:47,800
And civilisation is only
about 6,000 years old.

1510
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,400
So everything from the first
cave paintings to the present day,

1511
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,600
in the timespan of evolution,

1512
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,520
that has all happened while the crocodile
has been scratching its arse.

1513
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:00,800
[Jeremy] <i>After an hour or so
of drinking and chatting and sailing,</i>

1514
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,560
<i>but mostly drinking,</i>

1515
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:06,320
<i>the conversation started to take
a bit of a dip.</i>

1516
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:07,840
[Jeremy] I've got

1517
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,080
three quarters of a bottle of vodka,

1518
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,600
half a bottle of gin.
No. No, that's not gin.

1519
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:14,280
What is that? I don't know. I can't see.

1520
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,120
This is a blended brandy.

1521
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,560
-And I also have here a blended whisky.
-Hammond, your boat's buggered off.

1522
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,920
[Richard] That's got my passport on it.

1523
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,200
-[James] Shall I go?
-[Jeremy] You're going to have

1524
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,320
to leave my bar.

1525
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,560
[James] Do you want to come with me,
Hammond, or stay here?

1526
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,040
[Richard] This is more manoeuvrable.

1527
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,440
So we'll manoeuvre this up to mine
and I'll get off this onto mine.

1528
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,840
[engine sputtering]

1529
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,720
[Jeremy] Right, now, here we go.
International Rescue.

1530
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:40,960
[Richard] Please, catch my Capri.

1531
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,880
[Jeremy] I'll give it my best work.

1532
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:47,640
Don't fall in the water.

1533
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,440
[Richard] Crocodiles. Definite death.

1534
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:50,600
[panting]

1535
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:51,680
[Richard] I left the gin.

1536
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:52,960
Would you like another one before you go?

1537
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:54,440
I'd bloody love one, yes.

1538
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,280
[soft music]

1539
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,560
[Jeremy] <i>We continued
with our long journey.</i>

1540
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,680
<i>And as darkness fell,</i>

1541
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,800
<i>we realised we were a bit peckish.</i>

1542
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,720
<i>So, to catch some supper,</i>

1543
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,400
<i>James lowered his sardine nets.</i>

1544
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:16,640
[James] And...

1545
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,360
There we are at depth.

1546
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,520
I don't mind if it isn't sardines,
if it's just like general fish,

1547
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,680
but I'd really like sardines.

1548
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,720
[James] Well, it should be sardines.
This is a sardine boat.

1549
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,320
Here we go.

1550
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:41,800
Bollocks.

1551
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:45,640
[Richard] I'm starving.

1552
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,560
-[James] I know, I'm starving as well.
-[Richard] No, I'm beyond hungry.

1553
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,960
It's crisps, isn't it?

1554
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,800
-It's crisps.
-[Richard] It's crisps.

1555
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:58,920
[Jeremy] <i>And, as if things
couldn't get any worse...</i>

1556
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,920
I've now run out of ice.

1557
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,160
[soft music]

1558
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:12,840
[Jeremy] <i>So, we recharged our glasses
with warm drink.</i>

1559
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,160
<i>And, fuelled by that,</i>

1560
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:18,520
<i>crisps and some wistful memories,</i>

1561
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,120
<i>we sailed on.</i>

1562
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,120
It's gonna be a long night.

1563
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,600
Not our first.

1564
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:32,080
Ordinarily, I'd say not our last.

1565
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,040
Maybe it is.

1566
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,880
Oh, stop saying those things, Richard.

1567
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,280
[soft music continues]

1568
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,080
[sighing]

1569
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:49,680
[chuckling]

1570
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,680
What a job this has been.

1571
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,320
What a career.

1572
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,160
[bottles clanking]

1573
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,920
[yawning] Sorry.

1574
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,320
That was a long night. A very long night.

1575
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,000
[engine sputtering]

1576
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:59,560
I'm deaf.

1577
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:04,640
[James] <i>There was, however,
some good news.</i>

1578
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,240
The little blue dot, that's us.

1579
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,400
We are nearing the end of the lake.

1580
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,840
[Jeremy] <i>And because
we were nearing shore,</i>

1581
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:18,320
<i>we were surrounded by our chompy friends,</i>

1582
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:23,400
<i>which made the sudden message from
our director on our camera tracking boat</i>

1583
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,520
<i>all the more alarming.</i>

1584
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,520
[director on radio] <i>Phil to Hammond.</i>

1585
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:31,040
<i>You've got a problem with your boat.
Your boat is sinking, Hammond.</i>

1586
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,320
[Jeremy on radio] <i>Shit, you are.
You're going down at the stern, Hammond.</i>

1587
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,160
-[director on radio] <i>Go to the shore.</i>
-What?

1588
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,600
Give it some power, full power.

1589
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:44,280
[director on radio] <i>To the left,
to the left. Copy that. To the left.</i>

1590
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,560
[director talking indistinctly on radio]

1591
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:48,920
Repeat.

1592
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,120
[director on radio]
<i>To the left. To the left.</i>

1593
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,880
[Jeremy on radio]
<i>You are definitely going down, mate.</i>

1594
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,160
<i>You are definitely going down.</i>

1595
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:59,240
[Richard on radio]
<i>Yeah, my engine's going under.</i>

1596
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,080
Ramming speed.

1597
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:04,720
[tense music]

1598
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:06,640
[boat clanking]

1599
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,440
[boat rumbling]

1600
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,000
[engine revving]

1601
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,200
[Jeremy on radio]
<i>Right, you've saved the Capri.</i>

1602
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:23,200
Sorry, I've only just heard,
'cause of the noise of the engine.

1603
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:24,400
What's happened?

1604
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,800
[Jeremy on radio] <i>His boat, if you look,
it was definitely sinking from the rear.</i>

1605
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:31,560
<i>The whole of the back of his pontoons
were underwater.</i>

1606
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,360
[Richard on radio]
<i>Do not try and come in here.</i>

1607
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,280
<i>Because I came over sandbanks.</i>

1608
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,200
<i>I literally just hammered straight over</i>

1609
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:39,840
low ground to get here.

1610
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:44,880
[Jeremy] <i>James and I arrived
at another spot along the shore.</i>

1611
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,040
There's a ramp.

1612
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,640
[Jeremy] <i>And once we'd all disembarked...</i>

1613
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,600
-[thud]
-[Jeremy sighs] I've definitely arrived.

1614
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,160
[Jeremy] <i>I called another map meeting,</i>

1615
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:59,560
<i>because during the night,
I had had a brainwave.</i>

1616
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,800
So we've just come across Kariba.

1617
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:02,960
[Richard] Yep.

1618
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:05,680
[Jeremy] When we reach the border here
and cross it,

1619
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,080
we have gone all the way across Zimbabwe,

1620
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,600
which is what we set out to do,

1621
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:11,840
and we finish the programme.

1622
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,440
-[Richard] Yeah.
-Well done, us.

1623
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,920
In our three improbable cars.

1624
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:16,920
However,

1625
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,040
on the other side of the border
is Botswana.

1626
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:23,200
So, if you just turn the map over,

1627
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,800
-which I've learnt to do now.
-Well done.

1628
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:25,840
-Oh yes.
-Good technique.

1629
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:29,520
[Jeremy] If you look, this is
the Makgadikgadi, yeah? Salt pans.

1630
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,320
And there is Kubu Island.

1631
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,640
And that is where we began.

1632
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,680
That's where we did
our very first special,

1633
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,200
-17 years ago.
-[Richard] Wow.

1634
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:42,840
[Jeremy] We've always said this is one
of our favourite places anywhere

1635
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,040
we've ever encountered.

1636
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,000
-And it's where the baobab trees are.
-[Jeremy and James] Yeah.

1637
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,880
-I'd like to finish there.
-[Richard] Yeah, I think that's right.

1638
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:51,680
And it's only...
That's only... Woah.

1639
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,360
-It's a hundred K.
-120 miles or so.

1640
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,640
-Yeah.
-I'm up for that.

1641
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,960
[Jeremy] So we end this programme here,

1642
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:00,360
and we wrap <i>The Grand Tour</i> up there.

1643
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,160
[Richard] I think that's
a tremendous idea. It's fitting.

1644
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,120
[rock music]

1645
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,320
[James] <i>With our new plan agreed on,</i>

1646
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:12,920
<i>we set a course for the border,
feeling pretty good.</i>

1647
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:17,720
Well, this is wonderful, viewers.
We're back on proper tarmac.

1648
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:21,280
The sun isn't above my head yet,
so my steering wheel hasn't heated up.

1649
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,120
I love this moment.

1650
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,360
[music continues]

1651
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:30,240
[Richard laughing] Boot?

1652
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:39,240
[James] <i>But, a couple of miles later,
the jolliness came to an abrupt end.</i>

1653
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:40,760
[thud]

1654
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:41,760
[James] Jeez.

1655
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:43,120
[panting]

1656
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,120
Oh, God, this is gonna be pothole hell.

1657
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,520
[bumping]

1658
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:52,960
[Jeremy] Oh no!

1659
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,560
I don't believe my tyres
survived that one.

1660
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:59,600
[Richard] <i>The potholes, which were
nearly as bad as the ones in England,</i>

1661
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,360
<i>were not good news
for the most fragile car here.</i>

1662
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,320
[thud]

1663
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,560
Oh, shit.

1664
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:10,240
[thud continues]

1665
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,440
[Richard panting]

1666
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,360
[loud thud]

1667
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:15,640
[Richard panting]

1668
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:17,920
Ooh!

1669
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,440
Oh, shit.

1670
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,960
I am, for the first time,

1671
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:25,880
seriously starting to wonder
if this car can take it...

1672
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,240
and if it's gonna get there.

1673
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,360
[gasping]

1674
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,680
-[loud thud]
-Bugger.

1675
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:37,600
[Richard on radio]
<i>There's something very much amiss</i>

1676
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,240
on the rear axle.

1677
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,120
[James on radio]
<i>Sounds like a bag of cutlery.</i>

1678
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:43,880
[Richard on radio] <i>I hate to say
I think I should just</i>

1679
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:47,680
have a quick look just to make sure
the back axle's not gonna come off.

1680
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:53,880
[Richard] <i>The news
from underneath my car wasn't good.</i>

1681
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,000
[Richard] Right.

1682
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:56,600
[Richard panting]

1683
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:57,560
There.

1684
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,280
That's one shock absorber.

1685
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:04,040
-It's not connected at that end any more.
-[James] Yes, I see the problem, sir.

1686
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:07,200
[Richard] Every time the axle comes up,
that was going up,

1687
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,480
punching a hole in the body.

1688
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,400
-Have you actually made holes?
-[Richard] Yes.

1689
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,200
So, I'm gonna have to run without it.

1690
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,920
This young guy is saying
that if it had been him,

1691
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:18,480
he would have bought the 2.8 Injection,
not the three-litre GXL.

1692
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,360
-[Richard] Is that... Is he?
-Yeah.

1693
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,680
He says it's got a much stronger axle.

1694
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,360
[Richard panting]

1695
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:28,920
[Richard] <i>Annoyingly, the other
shock absorber had to come off as well.</i>

1696
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,520
[Jeremy] So you're just running
on leaf springs, yeah?

1697
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:32,480
Yeah.

1698
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:35,240
Like, it is exactly the same
as a medieval ox cart.

1699
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:36,200
[Richard] Yeah.

1700
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,520
[upbeat music]

1701
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:41,760
[James] <i>For Jeremy and me, though,</i>

1702
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:46,120
<i>it was much more entertaining
than a medieval ox cart.</i>

1703
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,840
[Richard screaming]

1704
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:51,200
[screaming continues]

1705
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:53,960
[James laughing]

1706
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:55,600
I'm gonna crash!

1707
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,040
[laughing]

1708
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:03,040
Well, if you wanted to know
what a shock absorber does,

1709
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:05,240
it stops cars doing that.

1710
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,320
[screaming]

1711
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:09,960
[Richard] Oh, yeah. I'm still in it.

1712
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,000
[laughing]

1713
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,760
[James] Representing Great Britain
in car trampoline,

1714
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,320
it's Richard Hammond from Ross-on-Wye.

1715
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:23,240
[James] <i>Sadly, the Ford's space-hopper
entertainment soon came to an end,</i>

1716
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,960
<i>because Zimbabwe changed again</i>

1717
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:28,200
<i>and we could no longer see it.</i>

1718
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,560
[tense music]

1719
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:33,720
[James coughing]

1720
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:34,800
[James] Smoke.

1721
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,240
[coughing continues]

1722
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:38,800
God.

1723
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,120
[Richard coughing] I can't breathe.

1724
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:47,760
[Jeremy] All right, so, everything's
now covered with a veneer of coal dust,

1725
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,040
because we're in the coal-mining area.

1726
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:56,680
That's why all the trees
and everything are black.

1727
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:59,120
Oh, come on.

1728
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,160
Come on.

1729
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,400
[tense music continues]

1730
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,280
If it's like this
all the way to the border, well, Jesus.

1731
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,680
[Jeremy] <i>Then, through the choking dust,</i>

1732
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,560
<i>I spotted what could be our salvation.</i>

1733
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:24,080
This road is intolerable.
Would you not agree?

1734
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,800
It's quite bad.
It's not the best.

1735
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:28,440
[Jeremy] Since we got
off the boats this morning,

1736
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:31,120
I have been shaken to pieces.

1737
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,960
My car is falling to pieces.

1738
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,840
That's a particularly virulent
type of dust as well.

1739
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,840
And I'm looking at this.

1740
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:42,560
-Well, that's not bumpy, is it?
-[Richard] Well, no, it's a railway line.

1741
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:46,840
So why don't we convert our cars
to run on the railway lines?

1742
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,080
We've done it before.

1743
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:49,720
-Ah, yes.
-We've done it before.

1744
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,280
-[James] Yes, we have.
-What other group of blokes

1745
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,560
can actually say with experience

1746
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:56,520
-that it can be done? We've done it.
-[Jeremy] We've done it.

1747
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,120
We'd have to check the train timetables.

1748
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,560
That sort of thing's really important.

1749
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:06,280
We'd also need to find a workshop where
we could make the modifications necessary

1750
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:07,440
to our cars.

1751
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:08,920
[Richard] Yeah, we'd need a big town
and a lot of machinery.

1752
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,720
-[Jeremy] Well, Vic Falls isn't far away.
-[honking]

1753
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:12,440
Oh.

1754
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:16,400
[director] It's not one of ours.

1755
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,840
-[Jeremy] Oh, shit.
-[all laughing]

1756
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:24,320
[Richard] Carry on.
They're quite pleased anyway.

1757
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,040
[James] Right, so you've called
some locals knob heads.

1758
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:28,000
-I just called him a dickhead.
-[James] Yeah.

1759
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:30,120
And they're coming out
to beat the crap out of you.

1760
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,280
[Richard] Hello. How are you guys?

1761
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,760
-[Jeremy] Hi, everybody.
-[James] He said you're the knob heads.

1762
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:36,640
[Jeremy] This traditional
English greeting...

1763
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,720
[man in an orange shirt]
That's fine. This is your home.

1764
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,440
-[Jeremy] Hey. How are you?
-[Richard] Nice to see you.

1765
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,040
[Jeremy] Good to meet you.

1766
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:45,400
[James] <i>Once Kofi Clarkson
had repaired diplomatic relations,</i>

1767
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:51,240
<i>we set off
on our detour to Victoria Falls.</i>

1768
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,640
[rock music]

1769
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:02,920
[Jeremy] And now,

1770
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,480
everything's on fire.

1771
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:08,440
Yeah. Oh, my God,
absolutely everything is on fire.

1772
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:09,640
Bloody Nora.

1773
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,400
We are having
some obstacles today, aren't we?

1774
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:19,200
[Jeremy] <i>Once we reached Vic Falls,</i>

1775
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:21,680
<i>our thoughts turned
to the matter of accommodation.</i>

1776
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,600
<i>And since the tight-fisted Mr Wilman
wasn't with us...</i>

1777
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,960
[classical music]

1778
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:35,840
[Jeremy] Afternoon.

1779
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,480
[Richard] Thank you.
Could we have three suites, please?

1780
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:41,320
And if you could have my tailor sent up,
that would be tremendous.

1781
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,120
That's what Bond always says.

1782
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,880
[Jeremy] <i>Then, after we'd washed
the coal dust out of our ears,</i>

1783
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,200
<i>we found a workshop</i>

1784
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,760
<i>and cued the music.</i>

1785
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:53,640
[<i>The A-Team</i> theme playing]

1786
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,640
[suspenseful music]

1787
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:31,600
[Jeremy] <i>A couple of days later,
the work was complete.</i>

1788
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:34,240
<i>And we met in the local rail yard</i>

1789
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,840
<i>to compare our contraptions.</i>

1790
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:41,200
Surprisingly simple job.

1791
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,800
I've put the front wheels
in a sort of animal feed trough,

1792
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:48,080
which has little railway wheels
on the bottom. Okay?

1793
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:52,080
At the back, rear wheels drive
that sort of belt system

1794
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:54,960
which then drives the railway wheels.

1795
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,120
It's simple and it's elegant.

1796
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:00,800
-Unlike that.
-[James] Let me talk you through this.

1797
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,640
Mine's quite elaborate,
and I suspect you're not interested,

1798
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:06,720
but I based it on
the diesel-hydraulic locomotives

1799
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,800
of England's western region.

1800
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:12,160
It's hydraulic drive.
The engine merely drives a pump

1801
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:14,960
which charges the hydraulic reservoir
which is what then drives the wheels,

1802
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,800
giving you massive torque at standstill

1803
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:18,840
from zero revs.

1804
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,120
How does it work?

1805
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,280
-That's how it works.
-I didn't understand.

1806
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,400
James, what the bloody hell's that?

1807
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:25,480
[James] Yeah, well, I did warn you.

1808
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:29,200
[Richard] Oh, my Lord! There's a whole...
What's all that?

1809
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:30,400
[James] That's a hydraulic pump.

1810
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:32,160
This is a hydraulic reservoir.

1811
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:33,800
These are pipes.

1812
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,880
Those are gauges that warn you
of the pressures.

1813
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,640
How will you see them
when you're driving along?

1814
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,440
As long as they're right when I set off.

1815
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,520
Unless you've got a co-pilot
who is a giraffe.

1816
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:47,080
[James] The point about the hydraulic
system is it's the transmission.

1817
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:50,040
This is how they built real locomotives,
so this is proven technology.

1818
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:51,920
It doesn't look like a real locomotive.

1819
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:54,240
-Well, it does, actually.
-No, it doesn't.

1820
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:55,600
It looks like a Triumph Stag.

1821
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:58,520
I'm visualising the Flying Scotsman,
the Mallard.

1822
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:00,720
-[Richard] Got it? Open your eyes.
-They're not hydraulic locomotives.

1823
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,080
-Is it made real?
-No.

1824
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,560
-[Richard] No.
-Yours looks even easier than mine.

1825
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:05,840
[Richard] You don't even need
to go over there.

1826
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,360
Sits on rollers,
back wheels turn rollers,

1827
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:10,480
rollers turn wheel,
it goes along, end of.

1828
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:12,160
[Jeremy] So it's just like
a rolling road?

1829
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:13,680
Yeah, it's like a running machine.

1830
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:18,560
Well, James, Hammond and I have proved
there's a very easy way of doing this.

1831
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:22,080
[James] But you've got
to manipulate your clutch,

1832
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:23,840
your throttle, your break pedal.
All I have to do...

1833
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,120
-Very much like driving a car.
-Driving, yes.

1834
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:27,800
Yeah, but it's not a car, you see?
It's a locomotive.

1835
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,440
All I have to do is set the engine revs

1836
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,480
and then I simply move a lever
backwards and forwards,

1837
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:35,080
the very thing that made
those early locomotives so appealing

1838
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,160
to people who'd grown up on steam.

1839
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:38,960
[Richard laughing]

1840
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:41,880
-[Richard] Shall we do this? I'm excited.
-They'll miss me when I'm gone,

1841
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:43,600
which is in a few days' time.

1842
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,120
[tense music]

1843
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,960
[James] <i>We boarded our trains,</i>

1844
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,680
<i>ready for the off.</i>

1845
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:51,760
Hydraulic pressure is building.

1846
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:54,200
[pressurising]

1847
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:59,160
[Jeremy on radio] <i>The train now departing
platform 1 is the Montecarlo Express,</i>

1848
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:01,880
<i>direct service to Botswana.</i>

1849
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:04,760
Here we go.

1850
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,440
[suspenseful music]

1851
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,560
[laughing]

1852
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:13,720
I'm going along!

1853
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:19,160
[clanking]

1854
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,240
And it works.

1855
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:26,520
Right, we're away.

1856
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:29,320
What?

1857
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:30,680
No, I'm in...

1858
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:32,480
-[thud]
-[Richard screaming]

1859
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:33,840
[car clanking]

1860
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:37,840
It makes very authentic train noises.

1861
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,840
Did you hear the little "gadunk gadunk"?

1862
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:41,840
[thud]

1863
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,120
Oh, God.

1864
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:47,600
[car squeaking]

1865
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,760
[James on radio] <i>Er, I've derailed.</i>

1866
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,080
[Jeremy] Oh, dear.

1867
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:02,640
I'm going to have to reverse
to see what his problem is.

1868
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:05,640
Oh yes!

1869
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:09,560
The Montecarlo Express
goes forwards and backwards.

1870
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:10,720
Look at that.

1871
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:14,040
What a machine I have built here.

1872
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,360
[thud]

1873
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:23,560
[Jeremy] <i>This meant that James and I
had both derailed.</i>

1874
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:26,240
<i>But it could be worse.</i>

1875
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,080
Oh, bugger.

1876
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,400
So that wheel turns that way,

1877
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:37,640
which turns these wheels the other way,

1878
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:40,840
which means it goes the other way

1879
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,160
to the way these wheels are turning.

1880
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:45,120
Er...

1881
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:47,360
right.

1882
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:48,640
[playful music]

1883
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,120
[Richard] <i>Luckily,
as we hadn't actually left the station,</i>

1884
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:56,880
<i>there was a telehandler on hand
to help sort out our problems.</i>

1885
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:00,640
Er, I'm gonna pick it up
and turn it around,

1886
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:04,200
so that when it's going backwards,
it's going forwards.

1887
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:07,160
So what this means is I've now got

1888
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,640
four reverse gears
that make me go forwards.

1889
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Right.
Now, simply put it back on the track.

1890
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,520
No problem. Everything's under control.

1891
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,880
[playful music continues]

1892
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:27,040
[Richard] <i>And, when all of us
were back on tracks,</i>

1893
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,080
<i>we set off once more.</i>

1894
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,240
[rock music]

1895
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:50,720
Isn't it funny,
you make one little error,

1896
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,640
miscalculation,
and then your life is this.

1897
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:00,960
[Jeremy] <i>Even though Hammond wasn't
bringing much dignity to the situation,</i>

1898
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:03,360
<i>this was still quite a moment.</i>

1899
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,080
<i>Because we were now grand touring</i>

1900
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:12,080
<i>on one of the world's
most iconic railway lines.</i>

1901
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,120
[Jeremy] It is remarkable that today,

1902
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:18,080
we can't build a railway line
in Britain from...

1903
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,080
London to Manchester,

1904
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:24,080
whereas 150 years ago someone said:

1905
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:27,440
"Let's build a railway line
from Cape Town to Cairo",

1906
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:32,880
7,000 miles across the spine of Africa.

1907
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,920
And they went:
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, we can do that."

1908
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:38,800
And then someone said: "But there's
a bloody great gorge in the way."

1909
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:41,120
And they said: "Well, it doesn't matter,
here's what we'll do.

1910
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:44,480
We'll build a bridge in Darlington,

1911
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:45,880
ship it out there,

1912
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:48,280
and we'll assemble it in situ
and it'll fit."

1913
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:49,480
And it did.

1914
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:51,600
And here it is!

1915
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,160
[solemn music]

1916
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:59,080
Oh, my God.

1917
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:02,280
Driving a Lancia Montecarlo

1918
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:06,960
on the Victoria Falls bridge.

1919
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,240
[solemn music continues]

1920
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,800
[James] We are 420 feet above the gorge.

1921
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,840
Let's just take a moment.

1922
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:45,120
[solemn music continues]

1923
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:50,880
I shall certainly miss
doing this sort of thing.

1924
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:58,800
[Jeremy] <i>Having ticked off
this unexpected bucket-list moment...</i>

1925
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,760
[playful rock music]

1926
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:07,560
<i>We trundled along with our minds
firmly set on the goal.</i>

1927
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:10,920
So, if we can use the railway now

1928
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:14,080
to get us past that sort
of coal-mining area,

1929
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:15,120
yeah,

1930
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:17,560
it's a home run then.

1931
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:19,040
[playful music continues]

1932
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:35,480
I once went on the Orient Express
with my wife in India.

1933
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:37,160
We had a brilliant time.

1934
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:39,600
Very similar.

1935
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,520
[music continues]

1936
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,840
[Richard on radio] <i>This is more
comfortable than the roads, isn't it?</i>

1937
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:56,120
[Jeremy on radio]
<i>And the other thing as well.</i>

1938
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:58,880
<i>For the first time,
I've been able to look at the views</i>

1939
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:00,760
rather than the road ahead.

1940
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:04,120
Yeah, I'm looking at the views
as they recede.

1941
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,880
Can we call you
the Disorientated Express?

1942
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:08,320
[chuckling]

1943
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:15,760
[Jeremy] <i>As we chatted away,
I had just one small niggle on my mind.</i>

1944
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:20,040
I've been assured that no train
is coming in the other direction.

1945
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:23,720
But what if one is?

1946
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:28,040
It's one of those things
you cannot get out of your mind

1947
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:30,760
when you're on
a single-track railway like this.

1948
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:36,320
[Jeremy] <i>And then,
that niggle was joined by another one.</i>

1949
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:40,360
Oh! I've got a high-temperature
warning here.

1950
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:45,080
I don't think my engine
is cooling quite like it should be.

1951
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:46,320
For some reason.

1952
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,880
Could it be that I've converted my car
into a train?

1953
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:54,240
[Jeremy] <i>My solution was
to lift the bonnet</i>

1954
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,600
<i>and then call on my old friends,</i>

1955
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:58,640
<i>Speed and Power.</i>

1956
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:00,600
[engine roaring]

1957
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,840
[tense music]

1958
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:08,920
[Jeremy] Indicated: 40 miles an hour.

1959
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:12,840
It isn't 40 miles an hour,
but that's what it says.

1960
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:17,120
The airflow is good now at this speed,
very good.

1961
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:19,720
[sighing]

1962
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:22,760
[Richard] Okay,
my right leg's going numb now.

1963
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:25,880
[tense music continues]

1964
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,840
[Richard] <i>By mid-afternoon,</i>

1965
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:31,880
<i>we were confident
we'd actually achieved something.</i>

1966
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,640
[James on radio] <i>I reckon we've passed
the end of the dusty road</i>

1967
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:41,080
<i>and all that rough stuff.</i>

1968
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,880
Yeah, I think we have.
We've passed the coal mine for sure.

1969
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:47,960
[Jeremy] <i>We therefore pulled over
at a level crossing,</i>

1970
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:51,880
<i>to do a job
which we'd been avoiding thinking about.</i>

1971
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,240
[Jeremy] How do we get them off?

1972
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:02,840
[James] I suppose the approaching
freight train could do the job for you.

1973
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:06,440
Right, what you need to do first,
using the adjustable spanner...

1974
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:08,400
I cannot count on us
using an adjustable spanner.

1975
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:09,400
Slacken the lock nuts.

1976
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:11,280
[Jeremy] Why can't you use one of these?

1977
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,560
Because it is the tool of a charlatan.

1978
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:15,760
-You don't mean "charlatan", do you?
-[James] I do.

1979
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:19,080
[Jeremy] You mean someone who just has
one tool instead of three hundred.

1980
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:21,160
-[James] Undo the lock nuts first.
-What are talking about?

1981
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:22,240
What's the lock nut?

1982
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:23,840
[James] That is a lock nut.

1983
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,680
[Jeremy] This spanner's too big.

1984
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:29,360
We don't all have to go
to the same old folks home, do we?

1985
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:30,720
-[James] No.
-[Jeremy laughing]

1986
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:33,520
I mean, it's not obligatory
after this that we all, the next day...

1987
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:36,040
He said he's deleting
our numbers as soon as we finish.

1988
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:37,000
[Richard laughs]

1989
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:40,000
And we finish, delete, now they've gone.

1990
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:41,600
[Jeremy sighing] Oh, God.

1991
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:43,240
Quite easy to do,
they're next to each other.

1992
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:45,080
World's smallest cun[bleep],
world's biggest cun[bleep].

1993
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:46,320
[Richard] We've stalled.

1994
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:47,800
[all laughing]

1995
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:50,080
That's actually true as well.
It's not a lie.

1996
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:51,160
It is true.

1997
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,200
-I've had an idea.
-[James] What?

1998
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:59,480
Why don't we go to a screen now that says
"Fifteen minutes later"?

1999
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:00,440
Yeah?

2000
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:02,760
Get the production people
to get them off.

2001
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,640
-And then...
-[Richard] It looks like we've done it.

2002
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:06,120
[Jeremy] It looks like we've done it.

2003
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,280
And then, we'll have
a line of voice-over:

2004
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:11,080
"Soon, all the cars were off
the railway line." [voice fading out]

2005
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:17,840
[Jeremy] <i>Soon,
all the cars were off the railway line.</i>

2006
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:19,440
[soft music]

2007
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:25,280
<i>And, as the border with Botswana
was just under 40 miles away,</i>

2008
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:28,000
<i>we had nearly completed our mission.</i>

2009
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:34,520
<i>And for that,
we had three little heroes to thank.</i>

2010
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:40,760
I am amazed
that the Ford Capri is still running.

2011
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,040
I really am.

2012
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:45,360
But I'm more amazed
by the Stag and the Montecarlo,

2013
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:48,640
because almost anyone who knows
anything about cars would say

2014
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:53,080
those two are
the most unreliable cars ever made.

2015
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,760
And here they are, soldiering along.

2016
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:02,800
And, we really did
save the best till last...

2017
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,840
{\an8}[soft music]

2018
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:20,560
Because Zimbabwe has provided
the perfect backdrop

2019
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:23,480
for our final motoring adventure.

2020
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:27,600

[emotional music continues]

2022
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:27,320
[Jeremy] Amazing cars!

2023
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,480
Amazing, amazing cars

2024
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:33,640
have survived
this amazing, amazing country.

2025
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:39,480
Essex!

2027

Overheating, my arse.

[emotional music continues]

2029
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,120
[Jeremy] Well done, Lancia.

2030
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:06,240
I can actually see the customs post.

2031
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:09,680
You fantastic little car, you've done it.

2032
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:11,040
You've done it.

2033
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,720
[Jeremy] <i>Before going up
to the checkpoint,</i>

2034
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:18,480
<i>we pulled over to reflect on the moment.</i>

2035
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:23,800
We have crossed Zimbabwe
and you don't know.

2036
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,200
[Richard] No, barely tell from the...
"Did you use these cars to do it?"

2037
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:30,080
Yeah, quite.
I would love to keep this.

2038
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:31,080
[Richard] Yeah.

2039
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:33,120
I would properly love to keep it,
actually.

2040
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:35,040
All we need is three bags
to take 'em home with.

2041
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:37,720
[Jeremy] I mean, this is, I think,
restorable.

2042
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:40,160
[James] I think mine is.
It'd have to completely come apart.

2043
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:41,800
[Jeremy] Anyway, listen.

2044
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,840
we must plough on, 'cause obviously,
we've finished the programme,

2045
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,240
now we've gotta finish the show.

2046
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:49,320
-[Richard] The whole thing.
-[Jeremy] So... Oh.

2047
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:51,520
[Richard] What?

2048
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:54,440
What?

2049
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:56,120
[Jeremy mumbling]
We've got a small problem.

2050
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,160
-[Richard] What?
-[Jeremy mumbling] Well, that's silver.

2051
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:01,920
-[James] Oh, yeah.
-We've got to get across the border.

2052
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:04,640
-The silver.
-[Jeremy] We've got a lot of silver.

2053
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:08,080
I mean, if we go through with them,
that's smuggling.

2054
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:09,080
[James] It is, yes.

2055
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:10,520
Shall we remove it?

2056
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:12,040
-[Richard] No.
-No, that would be...

2057
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:14,160
-[Jeremy] Well...
-Well, you really can't!

2058
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:17,200
-[Jeremy] You'd have no more downforce.
-[Richard] Yes.

2059
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:20,120
-[Richard] What do we do? Style it out.
-Style it out.

2060
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,400
-Relaxed.
-[Jeremy] Relax is the way.

2061
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:23,480
Job's a good 'un.

2062
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:25,600
[tense music]

2063
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:34,520
-[Jeremy] Hello.
-How are you?

2064
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:36,200
[Jeremy] Very well. How are you?

2065
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:39,120
[customs officer] Do you have
anything to declare?

2066
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:40,520
No.

2067

[heart beating]

2068

-Yes.

01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:50,200
He's trying to look normal.

2071
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:53,920
[officer] Can you help us
to open the bonnet?

2072
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:58,720
[heart beating fast]

2073
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:01,480
[Richard] Don't go round
the back of his car.

2074
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:04,200
[officer] Alright.

2075
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:06,360
Alright, thank you for your cooperation.

2076
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:07,560
You can go through.

2077
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:08,440
Thank you very much.

2078
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,360
[officer] Thank you, sir.

2079
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,480

[engine purring]

2083
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:22,960
[chuckling] Yes! Yes!

2084
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:29,200
I'm just gonna play it as
I'm just like a quiet,

2085
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:31,640
softly spoken...

2086
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:34,640
just a fairly miserable guy.
I'm just not...

2087
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,800
I'm not gonna be
my bouncy self, 'cause I'll overdo it.

2088
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,040
-[customs officer] Good day, sir.
-Good day.

2089
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:43,480
-[officer] How are you?
-[Richard] Very well, thank you.

2090
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:46,680
You have reached the Pandamatenga
border post into Botswana.

2091
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:47,960
[Richard] What?

2092
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:50,320
[officer] You have reached
the Pandamatenga

2093
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:53,120
-border post into Botswana.
-[Richard] Yes, yeah.

2094
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:55,520
-Do you have anything to declare?
-[Richard] No.

2095
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:57,760
Can you come and open the boot for us?

2096
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:00,040
[heart beating fast]

2097
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:04,880
-[officer] Please, can you move with us?
-[Richard] Yep.

2098
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:07,040
[James] That's not very promising, is it?

2099
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:09,360
[heart beating fast]

2100
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:18,320
-[woman officer] Thank you very much.
-[Richard] You're welcome, thank you.

2101
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:21,800
[officer] Enjoy Botswana.

2102
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:23,760
-And have fun.
-[Richard] I will.

2103
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:24,800
[officer] Thank you.

2104
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:29,240
Yeah, I killed it.

2105
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:33,400
[officer] Please can you come
and open the bonnet?

2106
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:38,280
[James] You'll notice, when I open this
bonnet, this is the original Stag engine

2107
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:41,280
and not the transplanted Rover one.

2108
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:42,920

2109
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:46,120

2111
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:54,480

2114
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:07,000
You can close the door.

2115
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:08,520
[James] Thank you.

2116
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:14,320
Oh, shit, the steering wheel's hot.

2117
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:17,240
The steering wheel's hot,
but don't draw attention to it.

2118
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:19,320
Thank you.

2119
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:20,600
[officer] Thank you, sir.

2120
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:24,600
Knee steer. Knee steer.

2121
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,200

and thousands and thousands of miles

2128
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:07,200
and had thousands and thousands
and thousands of adventures.

2129
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:12,920
And we're gonna end up
right where we started.

2130

[soft music continues]

2131
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:22,000
Never thought
that what we do together would...

2132
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:25,760
would go on as it has.

2133
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:31,720
I was excited when I got the job,
way back.

2134
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:33,560
Very excited.

2135
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:37,440
But I never dreamed
it would grow into a career

2136
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:39,600
and life-defining adventure.

2137
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:44,080
And, occasionally,
nearly career and life-ending adventure.

2138
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:52,280
I can't pretend it isn't gonna be
a wrench, ending this.

2139
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,000
'Cause it is.

2140
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:57,200

2141
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:03,040

2142
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:05,600
More than a third of my life.

2143
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:13,160
This is going to hit me
in quite small ways.

2144
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:16,080
Like there's a green bag,
I have a green holdall

2145
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:18,840
that I've used
since the very first special in Botswana.

2146
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:22,320
I've always used it for specials,
but I've never taken it anywhere else.

2147
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:25,280
So what will I do with that green bag?

2148
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:30,040
One day, I'll come across it
in that cupboard where we keep the bags.

2149
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:32,080
And I'll think: "Oh, yeah."

2150
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:35,680
And it will come back.

2151
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:43,040
Anyway.

2152
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:44,600

2327
02:08:05,400 --> 02:08:08,960
{\an8}[Richard laughing] A properly
three-legged old man went past!

2328
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:12,600
{\an8}[James] Maybe leaking slightly.

2329
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:14,200
{\an8}[Jeremy] What a moron.

2330
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:20,200
{\an8}[Richard] There must have been 40 people
in the room when the police arrived.

2331
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:22,200
{\an8}-[car crashing]
-[Richard] Woah!

2332
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:24,560
{\an8}[James] Clarkson!

2333
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:29,080
{\an8}[Jeremy] Sideways in linen.

2334
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:34,440
{\an8}-[James] Bollocks.
-[Richard giggling]

2335
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:40,920
{\an8}[Jeremy] Get out of the way,
get out of the way, I'm in a race.

2336
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:45,760
{\an8}-[James] Let's sing a song.
-[Richard] No.

2337
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:50,200
{\an8}[Jeremy] There's no dignity in that,
is there?

2338
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:51,240
{\an8}[Richard] Nah.

2339
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:56,200
{\an8}[Jeremy] Okay, it's time now

2340
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,200
{\an8}and, nobody's ever said this
on a car show before,

2341
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:01,800
{\an8}save the world.

2342
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:07,520
{\an8}[Richard] We don't all have to go
to the same old folk's home, do we?

2343
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:09,360
{\an8}-[James] No.
-[Jeremy laughing]
