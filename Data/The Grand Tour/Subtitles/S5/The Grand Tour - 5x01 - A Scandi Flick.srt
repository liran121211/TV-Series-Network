1
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,840
Hello, and welcome
to the top of Norway,

2
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,120
and specifically, the third
most northerly football pitch

3
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,560
in the entire world.

4
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,200
How far north are we?

5
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,440
Really far. We're 127 miles north
of the Arctic Circle.

6
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,800
And we're further north
than anywhere in Iceland.

7
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,800
And this isn't just a football pitch
as in just a field.

8
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,960
This is quite proper, isn't it?

9
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,200
- No, it is.
- Who do they play?

10
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,560
The North Sea Oil Eleven,
The Oil Rig Eleven.

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,440
- I don't know. The Trawlermen Eleven.
- Probably whoever passes!

12
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
There's no other villages.

13
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,120
- Anyway...
- See you tomorrow.

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
- You go and get the ball.
- I'll go get the ball.

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,200
Because I'll explain to the ladies
and gentlemen why we're here.

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,640
You see, the thing is, we are here...

17
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,640
We are here because...

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,800
You nearly
took my leg off!

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,920
Because throughout the 2000s,

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,040
the world of rallying produced some

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,720
of the most exciting four-wheel-drive,

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,000
four-door, family saloon cars
anyone had ever seen.

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,440
And what we want to know is,
which is the best?

24
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,800
This is my choice.

25
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,440
And before we've even begun,

26
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,600
here it is.
The Subaru Impreza is the best.

27
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,720
And that's that.

28
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,080
It just is.

29
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,040
At this point, James arrived

30
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,440
with one of his favourite things,

31
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,080
a contrary opinion.

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,560
That is a fantastic car, Hammond.

33
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,960
The Subaru is superb.

34
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,080
It's not quite as fantastic
as what I've brought,

35
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,480
which is a Mitsubishi Evo.

36
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,040
Yes, and if you're on
an actual rally special stage

37
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,440
or a racetrack,
the Evo is brilliant.

38
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,880
But the fact remains,
to get home again,

39
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,120
you will take the Subaru

40
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,040
because it's just more suited
to the real world, somehow.

41
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,720
It's more calm.

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,120
- Calm?
- Yes.

43
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,960
Who wants a calm rally car?

44
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,320
This twat.

45
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,160
At this point,
Jeremy demonstrated

46
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,320
that he hadn't been
listening to himself.

47
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,320
Hello!

48
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,920
Didn't you say that you had
to bring the best rally car?

49
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,000
It is. It's an Audi Quattro.

50
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,360
That's not an Audi Quattro.

51
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,280
- It is!
- Where does it say "Quattro" on that?

52
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,520
- It doesn't.
- Because it isn't one!

53
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,640
- There you go!
- Listen,

54
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,200
it doesn't say "The Duke of Marlborough"

55
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,720
on the Duke of Marlborough.

56
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,440
But we know he is the
Duke of Marlborough

57
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,240
because his ancestor
won a battle.

58
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,880
And that car's ancestor
won a battle. Twice.

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,120
- It won two battles.
- You've brought the wrong thing.

60
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,040
It's an RS 4.

61
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,920
- These are rally cars!
- It's an executive car!

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Listen, I am older than you two...

63
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,120
And old. And older.

64
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,040
- And with age has come wisdom.
- Weight.

65
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,680
Greyness.

66
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
And weight.

67
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,120
Yeah, it is a bit heavy, I admit.

68
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,160
Is it? They are a heavy car!

69
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,640
He said, dodging that one.

70
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,440
Very good.

71
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,080
- Oh, sorry.
- What?

72
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,000
My phone is buzzing.

73
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,920
Inevitable, go on.

74
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,440
There is no escape, is there?
There you go.

75
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,240
- Yes.
- You knew. Yes?

76
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,360
Mr Wilman.

77
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,880
Right, hang on.

78
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,800
In order to find out which
of your cars is the best,

79
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,920
you will drive across
what both the BBC

80
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,600
and The Guardian call
'Europe's last great wilderness'.

81
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,880
You will drive all the way across Norway,

82
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,640
Sweden and Finland,

83
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,600
never once dropping
below the Arctic Circle,

84
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,120
and you must get to Ivalo Airport
near the Russian border

85
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,760
by 5:00 p.m. on Saturday

86
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,360
'cause that's when your
plane back to the UK leaves.

87
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,440
- So we've gotta...
- How far is that?

88
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,520
Hold on. We've gotta get to
the finish line in six days.

89
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,920
What is it?
Five, six hundred miles?

90
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,240
- Ooh, over a hundred.
- A hundred miles a day?

91
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,200
In the Subaru Impreza! Ah!

92
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,760
It doesn't sound very tricky this time.

93
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,240
I mean, if we were in convertibles...

94
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,160
- ...or in four-wheel-drive...
- Or roller skates.

95
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,320
Yes, four-wheel-drive saloons,
near enough.

96
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,560
This isn't a clearing-up shower,
is it?

97
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,040
Should we get going?

98
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,240
- Yes.
- Yes.

99
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
Holy cow.

100
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,240
We set off, heading east

101
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,080
through the monochromatic
Lofoten Islands.

102
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,000
And at this point,
it's probably a good idea

103
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,240
to warn our
non-petrolhead viewers

104
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,640
that you're about to land on Planet Nerd.

105
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,920
Now, I should explain that there have
been 212 different versions

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,920
of the Subaru Impreza
over the years.

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,480
There'd be a new model every year,

108
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,800
and then there'd be a hot
new variant of that model,

109
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,360
and then there'd be
special limited editions

110
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,480
of the hot new variants
of the new model.

111
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,960
And every member of the very active

112
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,000
and committed Subaru community
has their own

113
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,840
very strong opinions
on which one is best.

114
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,400
I'm gonna say it's this one.

115
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,960
2003 WRX STi
V-Limited edition and...

116
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,040
...that's the sound
of my Twitter inbox exploding

117
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,920
with all the Subaru owner
community people

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,720
telling me I'm wrong.

119
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,920
I know exactly where
Hammond is coming from,

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,360
because over the years,

121
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,800
there have been ten iterations
of the Mitsubishi Lancer Evo.

122
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,040
And every one has been available
in various states of tune

123
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,280
and there have been various
accessories and extras

124
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,400
and so on and so on.

125
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,160
But I think peak Evo
arrived with this one.

126
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,640
The Evo VIII GSR.

127
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,040
And that is the sound of
everybody on every Evo forum

128
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,360
on the internet ringing up
to tell me I'm wrong.

129
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,280
This Subaru and James' Evo
have exactly 276 brake horsepower.

130
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,800
And there was also a rule in
the World Rally Championship

131
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,920
which stated the engine
could have a maximum capacity

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,520
of two litres,
it could be turbo-charged.

133
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,920
So this has a four-cylinder,
two-litre, turbo-charged engine.

134
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,520
It's a thoroughbred,
it's special.

135
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,080
It's rugged, it's purpose-built,

136
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,880
it was developed for rallying.

137
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,680
It's just the business.

138
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,440
I'll be the first to admit

139
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,520
that most fast Audis
are a bit hopeless.

140
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,280
But just occasionally,
they come up with a gem.

141
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,720
There was the original 20-valve
Quattro, the R8, obviously,

142
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,520
the TT RS, and this.

143
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,360
The 2007 RS 4.

144
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,400
The three best engines
ever made, in my book,

145
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,200
are the Lexus V10,
Alfa Romeo's V6, and this,

146
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,880
Audi's 4.2-litre naturally-aspirated

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
414-horsepower V8.

148
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,760
God, I love V8s.

149
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,880
James, how many
World Rally Championship wins

150
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,760
does your Evo have?

151
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,120
Oh, well, I'm glad you
asked me that, Hammond,

152
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,240
because actually I do know.
It's 26.

153
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,440
That's impressive.
That's a big number.

154
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,080
Here's a bigger number.
Mine has 46, which is many more.

155
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,600
Jeremy, how many
World Rally Championship wins

156
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,320
does your Audi have?

157
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Er...

158
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,760
Let me think. It's none.

159
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,240
Yes, none. None at all.

160
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,320
What you have done
by turning up at this challenge

161
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,520
in your Audi not-a-Quattro
is exactly the same

162
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,000
as you turning up at your farm
with a Lamborghini Aventador.

163
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes, Lamborghini made a tractor,
but that isn't one.

164
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,720
You could take a massive piss
in a Royal Doulton tea cup.

165
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,880
Yes, they did make urinals,
but that isn't one.

166
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's a damn sight faster than your cars.

167
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,880
Well, it's not.

168
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,080
This is the fastest car
in all environments.

169
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,880
Well, we don't
know about rallies

170
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,280
because it hasn't been in one.

171
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,120
Can I just say,

172
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,320
it's not the most wildernessy place
I've ever been to.

173
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,360
I mean, some of the scenery's
pretty spectacular,

174
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,720
but roads, Armcos, telegraph poles.

175
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,280
There's a great many
non-wildernessy things around

176
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,720
for a wilderness, yes.

177
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,360
Not for the first time,
I'm baffled by the views

178
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,040
of the BBC and The Guardian.

179
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,040
Convinced, however, that we
soon would enter the wilderness,

180
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,880
we pulled up at a
car accessories shop

181
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,120
to stock up on
important supplies.

182
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,760
I'd like to buy
a windscreen wiper

183
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,160
for a Subaru Impreza WRX
STi V-Limited edition.

184
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,040
Well, I'm gonna see if I can
buy some SD cards to play music.

185
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,800
Shit!

186
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,800
Oh! Good God!
There's absolutely no grip!

187
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,040
Right.

188
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,000
Holy crap!

189
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,280
You don't
need to move your legs!

190
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,760
I thought in the wilderness...

191
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,120
Oh. Director down.

192
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,440
- Director down.
- Wow.

193
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,920
We'd run over and help you,
but we can't.

194
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,480
- You all right?
- Oh, yes. Sorry, carry on.

195
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,280
Slowly and with dignity,

196
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,840
we all worked our way to the entrance.

197
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,680
F***ing hell.

198
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,360
No, that hasn't worked at all.

199
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,920
- Oh, God,
- No, that's not worked.

200
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,160
Where, mercifully,
we found some friction.

201
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,840
This, I quite enjoy going across.
Look at this.

202
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,320
This is a wilderness, isn't it?

203
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
- This is a...
- It's about survival now.

204
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,680
I can see what the BBC

205
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,840
- and The Guardian meant.
- Well, yeah.

206
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,520
What do you need? Subaru?

207
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
- Yeah.
- Well, what sort is it?

208
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,040
Impreza, which one?

209
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,320
- Outback, Impreza...
- WRX.

210
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,320
It's a 2003 WRX STi
V-Limited edition,

211
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,480
one of 555 made in Japan

212
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,920
to celebrate the
2003 Drivers Championship victory.

213
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah, all right.

214
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:12,720
- In the World Rally Championship.
- Yes. Is it a G12, G22, G13, G23?

215
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
I don't know.

216
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,400
- You don't know?
- Well, I...

217
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,240
- WRX. Here it is.
- Yes?

218
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,760
Got it. V10. Right, SD cards.

219
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,160
Erm, how do you say...
'SD card' in Norwegian?

220
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,360
Erm... 'I'm a twat'.

221
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Hello.

222
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,120
SD card.

223
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,600
SD card?

224
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,200
Have you got them?
Because my car is quite old.

225
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Jeremy?

226
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,920
- What is it?
- Snow grip.

227
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,920
Well, it's all in Norwegian.

228
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Well, I mean,
it doesn't come out in Norwegian.

229
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,520
Well, but we don't
know what it does.

230
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,800
Well, it's, I dunno.
Let's think, snow grip.

231
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
Yes, I think you spray it
on your tyres.

232
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
It makes tarmac really slippery.

233
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,880
- Yeah, well spray it on your feet.
- It's turtle wax.

234
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,080
Why would you put
turtle wax on something?

235
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
No, it's made by them.

236
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,480
- Spray it on your feet!
- Spray it on your feet.

237
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,280
- Like that.
- The bottoms of your shoes.

238
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,640
- Yeah.
- These two?

239
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,920
Purchases made,
we headed back to the cars.

240
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Yeah.

241
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,680
With me using my inbuilt warm
fluid dispensing system to melt a path.

242
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,120
Shuffle forwards.

243
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,680
Genius.

244
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,680
Back on the road,

245
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,440
the black-and-white scenery
became even more spectacular.

246
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,720
Holy shit. Look at that.

247
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,560
But there was one blot in it.

248
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,600
Have you noticed this red Volvo
that's been following us

249
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,320
since we left the football pitch?

250
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,040
I see, yes, I saw it then
as we came down there.

251
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,760
Is that definitely
the same Volvo?

252
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,280
With the four rectangular
rally lights on the front of it?

253
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,680
Yeah, it's the same one.

254
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,080
Soon, we were
getting low on fuel.

255
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,880
How shall we buy petrol
in the wilderness?

256
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,560
Perhaps we shall
have to make some

257
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,560
out of tree bark and shale.

258
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,680
Oh, no, it's all right.
Look, there's a petrol station.

259
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,960
And, while we were loading
up with fuel and snacks,

260
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,360
I noticed something.

261
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,960
- James?
- Yes?

262
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,520
Now, we have made
some left and right turns.

263
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,040
- Yes.
- And that,

264
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,640
you know what I'm thinking?

265
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Yes.

266
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,120
- Mr Wilman? Yes.
- Mr Wilman has provided us

267
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,960
with a backup car because
he assumes that after...

268
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,040
How long have we not been filming?

269
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,480
Three years?
We'll have forgotten how to drive.

270
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,920
And we'll crash into a tree,
which Hammond probably will.

271
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,840
Hammond, we've
worked something out.

272
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,120
Look.

273
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,760
- That's gotta be a backup car.
- It's a backup car.

274
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,760
It's a Volvo three, four,
five, it's the five-door.

275
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,360
My sister had one,
and I'm going to have to say,

276
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,440
it's possibly the worst car
made by Western Europe.

277
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,160
And it's been with us the whole time.

278
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,680
- Yes.
- It is then, yep. It is.

279
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,680
As we headed further north,

280
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,640
the weather finally
turned wilderness-ish.

281
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,600
Yeah, snowing.
Snowing. That's what it's doing.

282
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,200
Which put the kibosh on me
demonstrating the superior speed

283
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,800
of my Quattro.

284
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,920
Yeah, we probably can't do
a nought-to-sixty run here.

285
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,360
Can we?
'Cause it's a bit squirrelly.

286
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,520
This is infuriating, actually,

287
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,720
'cause I genuinely do need
to put you two in your place.

288
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,000
I've had a lot of abuse,
I've taken it well, I think,

289
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,520
but now I just need to quietly

290
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,000
and silently put you in your boxes.

291
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,800
Good luck with that.

292
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,240
Happily, however, after a few,

293
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,560
let's be honest, wrong turns,
we ended up here.

294
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,080
Ooh.

295
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,640
What have we come to?

296
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,840
This is interesting.

297
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,880
That's rock.

298
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,200
- It's a proper tunnel look.
- It's been concreted over.

299
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,600
It's like a grotto.

300
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,680
That's spray concrete, isn't it?

301
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,960
- Just onto the...
- Yeah.

302
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,400
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

303
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,920
Ooh.

304
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,880
So, do these lights now come on
like you see in those horror films?

305
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,800
- You're just...
- Ooh.

306
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,640
Ha. You know
what I'm thinking?

307
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,480
- Er, this?
- Well, it's dry. It's not skiddy.

308
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,280
- It's straight.
- And it's straight.

309
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,960
So, do you want,
are you proposing timed run

310
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,480
or who can achieve
the highest speed?

311
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,440
Well, it would have to be
the highest speed, wouldn't it?

312
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,600
What if...

313
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,640
- Whoa.
- Is that the end?

314
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,520
Jesus.
This is astonishing.

315
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,560
Somebody's got
a sense of drama here.

316
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,800
Wow, this is,
you do, it is quite important,

317
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,440
I would say, for comfort's sake,
you stop before this.

318
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,760
No, you'll be fine, though,

319
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,880
'cause there's a gravel trap
to stop you before you hit it.

320
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,880
So we're doing this individually,
'cause you can't do it at the same time.

321
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,080
- What? Oh, no.
- Obviously.

322
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,800
So, we do it one at a time.

323
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,920
How would you actually
record what speed you've done?

324
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,640
We put a GoPro camera on the dash.

325
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,880
- Yes.
- And then that will reveal the speed.

326
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,560
Somebody else goes
in the car with you to verify

327
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,800
- how fast you're seeing.
- No, we're not going

328
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,560
- in a car with you.
- We're not getting in a car with you

329
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,040
- driving towards a wall.
- We're not!

330
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,880
We know you
don't know when to stop.

331
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,560
- Yes, it's gotta be GoPros.
- Right. So I'll go first.

332
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,720
- Yes.
- Actually, you better go second,

333
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,480
'cause it'll be difficult
driving over the rubble

334
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,560
after he's done it.

335
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,040
With all the lights extinguished,

336
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,800
I lined up at the
entrance of the tunnel.

337
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,080
Are you feeling brave?

338
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,400
I mean, I'm looking...
That's a scary thing.

339
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,880
You can't even see where
the wall is at the end.

340
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,080
You will when you get there.

341
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,880
That's the trouble.

342
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,160
Moments before you arrive, those...

343
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,080
As the car spins down the tunnel,

344
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,080
it'll get shorter
as you knock each end off.

345
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,480
- Mm-hmm.
- Until there's just your cabin going...

346
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,000
Right. I think he's doing it.

347
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,000
Come on, Jeremy. Be brave.

348
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,160
Oh, there's wheel-spin there.
No, I'm not getting any grip.

349
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,160
Oh, my God, the lights
aren't coming on. Oh!

350
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,960
Oh, sh...

351
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,520
Jesus Christ Al-bloody-mighty!

352
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
Bloody hell.

353
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,200
How was it?

354
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,920
You're not going to enjoy it.

355
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,520
While I parked my car in a side tunnel...

356
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,880
James took his place at the start.

357
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Okay, you ready?

358
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
- Yes.
- Right.

359
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
- Can I just go?
- James May is ready

360
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,720
and will be setting off very shortly.

361
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,000
Brace. Brace. Brace.

362
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,880
Right. I've got the deck chair out
and a good book.

363
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,640
In your own time, begin.

364
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,560
That was a brisk start for a James May.

365
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,000
Big one. Big one. Big one.

366
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
Let's get the medics.

367
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,240
All right, are you okay to stand up?

368
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,400
Okay, hello.

369
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
Come with me.

370
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,560
I'm gonna get an ambulance in,
and we're gonna check you out, okay?

371
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,760
Oh.

372
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,880
Where is he?

373
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,440
I saw his head clobber
the side of the B pillar.

374
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,960
I mean, he went flying.

375
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,800
You know, that was, he went
in sideways into this wall.

376
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,040
The other
ambulance is here,

377
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,480
so they're gonna
take you in so we can...

378
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,440
It hurts on
the back of my back.

379
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,800
Like where?
Down the centre or middle?

380
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,080
Yeah, um...
Yeah, exactly where your hand is.

381
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,960
How are you feeling?

382
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,080
A bit shit.

383
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,280
Erm, the car's f***ed, isn't it?

384
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,800
It's not... It's not well.

385
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,920
You won't
drive it out of here.

386
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,320
Okay.

387
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,560
I'm in the Volvo.

388
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,680
- So nothing's broken?
- Doesn't seem to be.

389
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,040
Head's not hurt?

390
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,920
No, my neck hurts. I got a big...

391
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
- Whiplash?
- Mm.

392
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,440
Well, well done for not dying.

393
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,560
After James
was carted off to hospital,

394
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,000
there was only one thing we could do.

395
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,720
Stand by. Here I come.

396
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,240
I'm putting it in gear. Right.

397
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,240
Here he comes. Here he comes.

398
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,440
Braking, braking. Yeah.

399
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,160
Yeah!

400
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,240
There has been
a disturbance in the force.

401
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,040
You've arrived on
all four wheels

402
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,400
- with your trousers still on.
- I know.

403
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,800
Yeah, they haven't
had to cut them off.

404
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,240
He's in a hospital.

405
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,200
With Hammond's run done,
it was time to reveal the results.

406
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,840
Right, I've got mine here.
I'm going about 78 there.

407
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Yeah, just off the 80 mark.

408
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,760
Just shy of 80, which I think

409
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,080
- is pretty good.
- It's not bad.

410
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,120
But I'm going to
surprise you now.

411
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,320
James May's.

412
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,520
It's exactly the bloody same.

413
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,000
- I know.
- That's uncanny.

414
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,080
It is uncanny.

415
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,440
- Actually...
- And he's driving a car

416
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,920
which we know is
massively slower

417
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
- than mine,
- Yeah.

418
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,600
Which means he did
what you usually do

419
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,640
and accelerated
for far too long.

420
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,280
He's stolen my thing.

421
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,160
Actually, this is difficult because
you can't put him down as a DNF

422
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,720
- 'cause he did finish.
- Oh, he finished.

423
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
It's there.

424
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,360
But I think he,
we'll have to say he lost,

425
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,520
because I finished
and can drive home in my car.

426
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,440
But let's, but first of all,
come on, you.

427
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,280
We're both 78.

428
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,000
And that's 32.

429
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,600
- Yeah.
- And that's KPH.

430
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,720
A bit, yeah.

431
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,960
I saw what James did,
and I just thought, 'No, this time'.

432
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,800
Well, I think that
was a good experiment.

433
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,280
- Well done us.
- It's not quite what I had in mind.

434
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,360
No, it's...

435
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,760
With our
important work done,

436
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,040
we could have gone to see
James in the hospital,

437
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,400
but we decided it would
be more interesting

438
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,960
to explore these spooky tunnels.

439
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,240
What the hell?

440
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,080
Ooh. A cavern.

441
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,520
There's one down there!

442
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,320
Wait a minute.

443
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,880
Holy cow.

444
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's a Cold War submarine base.

445
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,800
No, it's not.
It is, it's a sub base.

446
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,840
And it's full of...

447
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,200
Marine, with gun, Marine.

448
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,240
What, where, what are they doing?

449
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,320
They're Special Forces.

450
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,760
Right. These are landing craft.

451
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,120
He doesn't look very happy.

452
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,000
I think we're in the way.

453
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,080
I'm very sorry!

454
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,000
Oh, what's round here?

455
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,480
Hammond, we may have
driven into an office.

456
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,800
What?

457
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,320
The Special Forces
are looking at us.

458
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,880
Can I just ask,
are you Norwegian?

459
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,360
- Sorry?
- Are you Norwegian?

460
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,800
I'm not Norwegian, no, no.

461
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,280
Where are you from?

462
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,160
- The Netherlands.
- You're Dutch?

463
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,640
Dutch. All Dutch.

464
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,600
Dutch?
Everyone's Dutch?

465
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,040
- Everyone is Dutch.
- Of course.

466
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,120
Sit rep, the Dutch
and the Norwegians are at war.

467
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,000
The day's just got weirder.

468
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,120
Oh, heavens!

469
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Hello?

470
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,920
Jeremy, you're pulling

471
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
a top-secret submarine's
hosepipe with you.

472
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,000
Ah.

473
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,600
Yeah. Sorry.

474
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,040
- They're Dutch.
- What?

475
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
They're Dutch.

476
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,760
What's staggering me
is not one of them has said,

477
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,880
- 'What on earth...
- 'What are you doing here?'

478
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,080
...are you doing here?'

479
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,880
My apologies.

480
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,400
Sorry. Sorry.

481
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,440
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

482
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,720
- You're welcome.
- Good luck. Carry on.

483
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,960
I don't know
who's side we're on.

484
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,240
When we come out, are we on the
Norwegian side or the Dutch side?

485
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,960
I'm gonna bear the flag
of whoever's holding the gun.

486
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,920
The next morning,
James was still in hospital.

487
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,880
So Jeremy and I
got back on the road,

488
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,880
our thoughts very much on
the tragic events of the day before.

489
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,320
It's funny how these things
affect you afterwards.

490
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,920
I mean, that was traumatic,

491
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,920
running down that tunnel
and seeing at the end of it

492
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,800
that fabulous car wounded.

493
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,320
I'm just thinking, Hammond.

494
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,320
You know, you've crashed countless cars
over the years

495
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,560
and it doesn't really matter
'cause they're just

496
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,920
metal and plastic and glass,

497
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,200
but the Evo's more than that,
isn't it?

498
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,560
Yeah, it's not a car that you crash

499
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,040
or ding in the usual way.

500
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,880
It's a car that gets injured

501
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,920
'cause there's so much passion

502
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,200
wrapped up in it from a lot of people.

503
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,040
And what's worse for me is
I've lost my playmate.

504
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,920
Er...

505
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,280
Yeah, I've lost my car's
natural sparring partner,

506
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,280
the one car that could
keep up with it, live with it.

507
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,800
I'm in an Audi Quattro!

508
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,480
It's not an Audi Quattro.

509
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,200
It's not a rally car!

510
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,240
Stunned
by Hammond's criticism,

511
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,120
I made a proposal.

512
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,960
What if I could find
a rudimentary wilderness workshop

513
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
and turn it into a rally car?

514
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,000
All right, well, if you
can find one and do that,

515
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,320
I'll do the one thing
I can do to improve my car

516
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,840
and give it more power,
then we're on.

517
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,720
So if I yobbify my car
and you up the power of yours,

518
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,520
then they become natural rivals.

519
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,680
Then we are talking.

520
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,360
Right. Set sat nav.

521
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,240
With our modding plan agreed on,

522
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,120
we hunkered down and headed
for the Swedish border.

523
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,920
Socket or spanner?

524
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,280
- Socket.
- This one?

525
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,200
Back where we'd
stayed the night,

526
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,200
I was now out of hospital,
nursing a broken rib

527
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,080
and trying to save the really
badly wounded patient.

528
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,800
Starting from the front,
underneath there,

529
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,240
the radiator is broken
and is leaking.

530
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,400
The oil cooler is mangled.

531
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,680
This is the intercooler pipe.

532
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,880
As you can see, the air flow
through that is not going to be

533
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,800
as the manufacturer intended.

534
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,360
This brake calliper actually
cracked in the impact

535
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,880
and now leaks.

536
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,240
This is the drive shaft,
which is...

537
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
Ah, God.

538
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,720
That is very broken.

539
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,280
Body work is mangled.

540
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,880
This wheel is in the wrong position.

541
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,680
It's not pointing the right way.

542
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,560
The exhaust, it's all now
several inches further that way.

543
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:29,200
This car is extremely badly wounded,
but it isn't dead.

544
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,360
Let's hope...

545
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,320
Ow. I shouldn't have done that.

546
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,720
...we can push it back into shape.

547
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,120
Many miles ahead,

548
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,440
we were in yet another
winter wonderland.

549
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,400
That is pretty impressive.

550
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,160
But there were issues,
chief among which was

551
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,800
the Quattro's satellite
navigation system.

552
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,960
You are not on a digitized road.

553
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,560
Oh, I am.
I am on a digitized road.

554
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,640
Don't be stupid.

555
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,320
Unable to provide recommended
route from here.

556
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,320
You are not on a digitized road.

557
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,520
Yeah, my sat nav
is saying I'm six kilometres

558
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,000
into the wood on our left.

559
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,720
Well, we're in the wilderness,
'Europe's great last wilderness'.

560
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,640
I suspected that, this far north,

561
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,680
sat nav struggled to see any satellites.

562
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,280
But there was no time to check that out

563
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,200
because of another problem.

564
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,000
Terror.

565
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,240
The speed of
the oncoming snowploughs.

566
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,600
No. Oh, no.

567
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,400
Oh.

568
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,840
That is doing 170.

569
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,960
They are properly committed,
aren't they? Here he comes.

570
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,680
Yeah.
It's Kimi Raikkonen's winter job.

571
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,400
Eventually, though, we managed
to find the Swedish border,

572
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,000
cross it, and reach the town
I'd been aiming for.

573
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,120
This is the town, Hammond.
This is the town.

574
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,400
There will be a workshop here.

575
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,000
I'd say there's a good chance
there will be.

576
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,320
They'll have snow machines
and ploughs and things

577
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,080
that need mending all the time.

578
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,440
Sure enough,
we found a friendly local

579
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,120
who lent us his workshop.

580
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,880
And, after buying some parts
at a wilderness accessories store...

581
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,240
Tape...

582
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,120
We both got down to work.

583
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,240
Me with some engine-mapping software,
and Jeremy not.

584
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,800
How's your mapping coming along?

585
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,760
I'm done.
I'm onto physical stuff now.

586
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,040
I'm not doing a lot.

587
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,840
You can really change
the map that quickly?

588
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,120
Yeah.

589
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,440
So you've just entirely
changed this car's brain?

590
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,880
The main thing is
we're in the Arctic now.

591
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,640
The air is cold and dense,

592
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,280
much colder and denser
than where this is set up for.

593
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,640
So that means
it's got more oxygen in it.

594
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,720
- So there's more...
- The air has?

595
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,120
Yes, the cold air is heavier, denser,

596
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,600
sits there with more oxygen in it.

597
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,360
So that's what you need to mix
with the petrol vapor

598
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,360
to make lovely, big, rich,
juicy explosions in there.

599
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,720
- That's amazing.
- Yeah. Right.

600
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,880
- I'm going to...
- James is going

601
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,560
to be horrified when he gets here
to discover that my jack...

602
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,760
Where's my jack gone?

603
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,040
Nowhere.

604
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,240
Look at that.

605
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,320
Moth.

606
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,360
Meanwhile, back in Norway,

607
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,920
progress in my workshop
wasn't so good.

608
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,760
That bit should be there.

609
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,680
That should be rectangular.

610
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,080
Wow.

611
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,560
Okay, what next?

612
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,240
The next morning,
there was still no sign of James.

613
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,320
But Hammond and I had
had a productive night.

614
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,520
The yobbification program is complete.

615
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,880
We have the Audi rallying livery.

616
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,920
We have the full Pink Floyd lighting rig.

617
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,520
And there's no denying
that it's a Quattro now

618
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,440
because look, it says
'Quattro' everywhere on it.

619
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,480
Where are my keys?

620
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,960
I put them in that bath tub,
so you won't lose them. There.

621
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,320
Oh. Oh, brilliant.

622
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,400
Utter, utter...

623
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
Has it frozen?

624
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,880
Yes, Jeremy, the bath
full of water has frozen

625
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,000
with my keys in.

626
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,520
I tried to stop it freezing
by weeing in it.

627
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,120
Yeah, that would
explain the yellow ice.

628
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,800
You're sick in the head.

629
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,920
But it's funny, it's very funny.

630
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,040
- Well done, really.
- It is? Cause there they are.

631
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,200
- Yeah, there they are.
- It's extra, I didn't...

632
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,640
And yet they're not.

633
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,920
It's just, it was cold
last night, wasn't it?

634
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,840
- Wasn't it just?
- Isn't it?

635
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,800
Having eventually freed my key,

636
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,200
I was able to savour
the fruits of my labours.

637
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,800
Right, my laptop wizardry
has taken the power up

638
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,000
to 356 horsepower.

639
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,760
I've upgraded the exhaust,
as you can hear.

640
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,120
Induction air filter kit.
Launch control. Anti-lag on the turbo.

641
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,160
And the best livery of all...

642
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,520
This isn't just
the best car here,

643
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,160
this is now the best car ever.

644
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,080
I am like a dog with two dicks
and a super yacht.

645
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,200
Meanwhile, a few miles away,

646
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,480
I'd come across
something rather special.

647
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,440
A frozen lake with
a race track carved onto it.

648
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,880
And it was completely deserted.

649
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,760
Until it suddenly wasn't anymore.

650
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,800
Yeah, looks like Hammond
has got his keys back.

651
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,120
Oh, my word.
Come on!

652
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,520
What a machine!

653
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,000
Obviously, I haven't
touched the engine.

654
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,120
There was no need.
It's already a masterpiece.

655
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,760
But I have fitted a
magnificent new exhaust system.

656
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,360
Listen to that V8 now!

657
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,600
Oh, it's howling.

658
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,560
I could crash when I like.

659
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,080
This is my idea of heaven!

660
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,920
Opposite lock.
Scandi-flick it in.

661
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Holding it...

662
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,680
This just flatters the incompetent.

663
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,440
I am now fully Swedish.

664
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,560
Getting close.

665
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,120
Right. Hammond, you think
you wanna come past, do you?

666
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,440
Now I'm going to unleash
my secret weapon.

667
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,000
Ready?

668
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,880
Come on, Clarkson.

669
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,120
What the hell?

670
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,840
Whoa.

671
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,080
You weren't ready for that!

672
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,360
Businessman's car, my ass.

673
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,600
It's my new handmade
exhaust system.

674
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,360
And it's designed to
prevent you from overtaking.

675
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,200
We're on a frozen lake.

676
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,200
If you melt it,
it's just a lake.

677
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,480
Whoa!

678
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,760
Once I'd finished
barbecuing my colleague,

679
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,840
we pulled over to inspect
the damage he'd done

680
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,080
when he'd headbutted a snow bank.

681
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,680
I've lost half the front of it!

682
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,880
It looks now like
it's been in a pub brawl.

683
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,040
- Anyway...
- More work to be done.

684
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,600
Hammond then went off
to find the tools he'd need

685
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,800
to mend his car and while he was gone,

686
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,680
I modified one of his modifications.

687
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,520
♪ Anytime, anyplace, anywhere ♪

688
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,680
♪ There's a wonderful drink
you can share ♪

689
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,280
♪ It's Martin ♪

690
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,160
Before Hammond
noticed my handiwork,

691
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,640
we received news that
Captain Slow was about to arrive.

692
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,600
And this caused us to wonder, in what?

693
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,800
I'm strangely conflicted

694
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,640
because I desperately want him
to be in the Volvo

695
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,760
and I desperately want him
to be in the Evo.

696
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,840
Yeah, I know what you mean.

697
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,640
I want him to be in the Volvo
because he deserves

698
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
- to be in the Volvo.
- Yeah.

699
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,080
- Just for hurting the Evo.
- Yeah.

700
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,000
- No way.
- Oh, wow.

701
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,080
No way.

702
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,640
I am elated!

703
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,000
Hello.

704
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,880
We are pleased
and angry simultaneously.

705
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,200
It's not pretty.

706
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,040
No.
It's like Frankenstein's Evo.

707
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,920
And it lives as well.

708
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,680
What was broken on it?

709
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,960
Well, the intercooler,
radiator, oil cooler,

710
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,040
wheel wishbone,
top wishbone, drive shaft,

711
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,680
chassis rail, door,

712
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,640
exhaust, engine out of alignment.

713
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,920
- You really did hurt.
- It's worse than that.

714
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Half the people in
the world hate you

715
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,200
- because you destroyed an Evo.
- Mm-hmm.

716
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,080
And people, it divides into
people who like Subarus

717
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,280
and like Evos.

718
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,920
But the other half
of the world also hates you

719
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,680
because you took away
the Subaru's competitor.

720
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,160
- So, everybody hates you.
- Erm, It's still here.

721
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,200
- Yes.
- But you have missed a lot of testing.

722
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,520
We've established that the Audi
is faster than the Subaru, in the tunnel.

723
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,600
And we've established
that it's much more fun

724
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,280
- on a frozen lake and faster.
- Well, no.

725
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,680
- We haven't established that.
- We have.

726
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,760
- Well, we haven't.
- We have.

727
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,880
- We haven't.
- Other things you need to know, James.

728
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,440
- Yes?
- Norway is at war with Holland.

729
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,040
- Oh, God, yeah. Watch out.
- Is it?

730
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,600
Real surprise.

731
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,160
So, where are your cars?

732
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Well...

733
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,600
Oh, that's actually it?

734
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,640
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah. We've been busy.

735
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,760
- Good on you.
- We've done.

736
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,040
I'm telling you, we have
been really hard at work.

737
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,200
We've done important testing
and this.

738
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,160
Anyway,
what are we doing next?

739
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,640
Mr Wilman gave us
the answer to that.

740
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,200
We were going to see which
of our cars was the best

741
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,360
at skijoring, a sport in which
you race round a frozen lake

742
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,960
while towing a skier.

743
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,880
Mad? You don't even know
the half of it.

744
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,880
One of them has only got one leg.

745
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,000
What?

746
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,480
But did he lose
the other one doing this?

747
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,840
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

748
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,000
- Hello.
- Good afternoon.

749
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,600
Hi. Good afternoon.

750
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:28,920
There then followed a typically
verbose Scandinavian conversation.

751
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Do you do it here because there aren't
very many mountains to ski on?

752
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,560
Yeah.

753
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,000
How do you win?

754
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,520
The fastest wins.

755
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,160
Soon, though,
the chat started to flow.

756
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,600
You see that snow that,
what's that snowmobile towing?

757
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,840
It's taking a shed out for a drive.

758
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,000
For fishing.

759
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,800
- What?
- For fishing, ice fishing.

760
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,960
Oh, it's like a fishing hut.

761
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,040
- Ice-fishing hut.
- Oh, is it on skis?

762
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,120
Yes.

763
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,400
- So it's a caravan?
- So, that's like a caravan.

764
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,600
- It's a caravan.
- Yeah, but on skis!

765
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,120
That's quite good.

766
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,560
Distraction over,
we got back to the job in hand.

767
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,000
How fast do normally go?

768
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,520
120.

769
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,640
- What?
- What?

770
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,840
- 120.
- I wouldn't do that without a skier.

771
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,400
- That's kilometres an hour, yes?
- Kilometres per hour, yeah.

772
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,440
- But it's still...
- That's still 70.

773
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,520
Yes, I wouldn't...

774
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,000
- 70 miles an hour?
- Yeah.

775
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,080
Closer to 80.

776
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,160
- What?
- Yeah.

777
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,080
But what?
We've never done this.

778
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,440
Yeah, so we won't go that fast,

779
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,600
but you can still enjoy it.

780
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,800
- That's sort of up to us, really.
- That's the problem, it's up to us!

781
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,640
We have done a little bit
of driving around this track.

782
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,760
Well, I haven't.

783
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,480
And when you're
following the other one,

784
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,920
he doesn't know what he's
gonna do in the corner,

785
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,880
how he's gonna do it,
is he gonna turn early...

786
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,160
Well, I don't know what
the car's going to do.

787
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,680
Yeah, but your cars are intact.

788
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,000
- I mean, not...
- My Evo.

789
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,880
- No, his isn't, yeah.
- But your cars.

790
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,760
Yeah, he just looked at
the middle pedal and thought,

791
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
'No, I don't need that'.

792
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,920
Still not convinced
this was a good idea,

793
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,680
we lined up for the start.

794
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,680
It's the second stupid thing
we've done on this trip.

795
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,840
How cold do you think
it's going to be on skis

796
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,120
at 80 miles an hour?

797
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,120
Unimaginably cold.

798
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,520
Will there be a dribble
of warmth from my exhaust

799
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,000
to keep him warm, do you think?

800
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,840
Yes, but you don't want
to cross the finish line

801
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,480
with some bacon
on the end of a string.

802
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,400
Here we go.

803
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,280
There's a man
in the rear-view mirror

804
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,920
and he's keeping up with me.

805
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,400
That's alarming.

806
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,880
Where does it go?

807
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,960
I'm cutting off Hammond.

808
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,760
Oh, I've bollocks'ed that.

809
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,200
Oh, sorry.

810
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,880
65 miles per hour,
and he's still there.

811
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,120
This is terrifying. I'd rather
drive in that tunnel again.

812
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,080
And that's 80 miles an hour
we've just achieved.

813
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,960
I want to catch Jeremy
more than anything else

814
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,720
in the world, but I don't wanna
kill someone else doing it.

815
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,040
Hammond's gaining,
he is gaining.

816
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,760
He wants me to go faster.
He's bloody nuts.

817
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,880
I went wide!

818
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,200
No!

819
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,680
No!

820
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,080
I have the lead!

821
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,240
That was a mistake.

822
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,400
Shit, I've lost him.

823
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,560
Right, last lap.

824
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,400
Through the chicaney bit.

825
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:02,920
Come on!

826
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,800
Mapping's good,
but it doesn't beat cubes.

827
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,640
And I have a lot of cubes.

828
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,160
Come on!

829
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,880
The power of the V8 is mighty!

830
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,560
Yes!

831
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,560
I got him back!

832
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,120
Did he, oh, I forget to check.
He's still there.

833
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,040
Where is he?

834
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,320
Oh, thank God.

835
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,800
Having bid a fond farewell
to these foolish men...

836
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,320
- Well, thank you.
- Guys, yeah.

837
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,600
- Yes, really.
- It was a pleasure.

838
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,680
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. Thank you.

839
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,760
It was a terrifying experience.

840
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,880
I don't know what the Swedish
for 'thank you' is,

841
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,960
- but thank you.
- A great spectacle and incredibly brave.

842
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,120
We continued on our way.

843
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:14,640
And an hour later,
something dawned on me.

844
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,120
This is the first time
since we set off

845
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,200
that I've genuinely felt
like I'm in a wilderness.

846
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,720
I mean, there's just
no evidence anywhere

847
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,320
of man's existence.

848
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,960
There's no town.
There's no village.

849
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,440
There's no... hotel?

850
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:42,440
Chaps, I'm loving the wilderness, but
where are we going to spend the night?

851
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,640
I've been thinking the same.

852
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,520
It's very nice to feel
we're finally out there,

853
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,680
but there's no hotels.

854
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,960
It is getting quite dark as well.

855
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,120
Yeah. Well, why don't you
turn your light on?

856
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,280
I say 'light'.

857
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,080
I have got my light on.

858
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,400
Would you like to
see my lights, James?

859
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,960
Well, I'm gonna say no,
but, yes, there you go, well done.

860
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,120
We drove for hours

861
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,240
and there was still no sign of life.

862
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,040
It's minus six-and-a-half degrees
out there.

863
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,160
Seriously,
what are we going to do?

864
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,040
Come on.

865
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,840
Eventually, though,
as we approached a wood,

866
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,440
we saw in my headlights
the outline of a building.

867
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,080
- I wonder what it is?
- I don't know.

868
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,360
This is like a survival hut.

869
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,640
This is left so that,
if you're stuck in the wilderness,

870
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,720
you come in and help yourself.

871
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,160
It's got all the basics.

872
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,800
So this is like a Sami hut?

873
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,160
A pile of wood.

874
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,640
Meat!

875
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,720
Well, it'll all
be frozen, wouldn't it?

876
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,880
Yeah, the meat'll be fine.
We can light a fire.

877
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,080
Yeah, we need to get the fire lit.

878
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,880
Are you still going on
about your ribs?

879
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,720
Hello! Look at this.

880
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,640
- Oh, bollocks.
- You massive tit.

881
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,720
What, did he dropped it?

882
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,440
Yeah, but it doesn't matter.

883
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,040
Yeah! Meaty treat!

884
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,360
Oh, bloody hell, that's fabulous.

885
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,560
- Isn't it?
- Yeah. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

886
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,400
We've had a little adventure
out in the wilderness.

887
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,880
It's true, we are
living a wilderness lifestyle.

888
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,440
But we could be eating Rudolph.
And who are the other ones?

889
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,480
Donner and Blitz,
who were the other reindeers?

890
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,360
Flatulence, Ball Bag and Stingray.

891
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,000
Steve. Robert.

892
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,720
- Rudolph.
- Yeah.

893
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,080
- Donner and Kebab.
- Alimony.

894
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,000
There wasn't one called Alimony!

895
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,080
Bob.

896
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:39,960
Guys?

897
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,920
What the hell is that?

898
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,080
This turf hut is
the central part of the camp.

899
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,040
One of these was all, it's a,
we've slept in a museum exhibit.

900
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,560
There's a gift shop.

901
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,360
Jesus.

902
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,520
They've got little...

903
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,760
There's a petting...
They're petting reindeers.

904
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,120
Now, wait,
they don't know...

905
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,440
- No, they think...
- ...that we've been in there all night.

906
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,040
I haven't got any trousers on.

907
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,640
Might I suggest you go
and put some trousers on.

908
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,920
- Yeah.
- We can pack up.

909
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,920
'Cause what I'm going to do
is sidle back to the cars.

910
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,960
Oh, I enjoyed looking at the hut.

911
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,080
- Yeah.
- Did you?

912
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,080
- That was interesting, I think, Hammond.
- Yeah, a really good look.

913
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,000
Well worth 10 or 15 minutes
of your time, isn't it?

914
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,000
Again, we thought we
were in the wilderness.

915
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,480
Hammond!

916
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,480
Oh, I can only imagine

917
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,040
it's some sort of
freak weather event,

918
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,640
like a shaft of cold that...

919
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,360
I mean, it could
have hit any of us.

920
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,480
But it's hit you.

921
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,720
Now, if you get hit
by one of those blasts of ice

922
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,840
- round these parts, it's a lucky...
- You did this!

923
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,320
- Well...
- Because I put your keys

924
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,920
in ice, you put my entire car...

925
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,520
How did you do that?

926
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,520
Slowly and whilst grinning.
Sorry.

927
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,680
It's pretty, though, isn't it?
Look!

928
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,040
It's undrivable, is what it is.

929
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,400
- For now.
- It's an incredible effect.

930
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,600
But by June...

931
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:34,800
You are gonna help me
get the ice off that car.

932
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,720
I am. And also, I'm not.

933
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,800
What do you think Jeremy will do

934
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,200
to solve the little conundrum
I may have given him?

935
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,600
How long will it be,
do you think, before he says,

936
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,960
'Right, I'll set fire to it'?

937
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,080
Half a minute?

938
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,960
Yes! This is good.

939
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,960
Morning.

940
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,760
This is gonna take forever.

941
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,000
I've overdone it.

942
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,040
Well, he could just
talk about it a lot

943
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,400
'cause all that hot air
would eventually melt the ice

944
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,040
on the car, wouldn't it?

945
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,880
Traditional Sami fire extinguisher.

946
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,200
Hammond and I
headed further east

947
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,000
through the empty landscape,

948
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,960
with me still a bit dumbstruck

949
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,200
about how the Evo had
come back from the dead.

950
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,880
Think what happened to
the front of this car.

951
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,920
The front wishbone was bent
back on itself, but here we are,

952
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,480
temperature absolutely stable,
steering rock steady.

953
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,120
I wouldn't have believed it.

954
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,280
If we were in an old black-and-white
British newsreel,

955
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,840
it would be described
as a plucky chap.

956
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,920
But it's more than a plucky chap.

957
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,240
I mean, it's just incredible.

958
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,920
Soon, Richard and I were nearing
the mining town of Kiruna.

959
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,840
I don't know much about it
apart from the fact

960
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:38,200
that it hosts the world's largest
underground iron ore mine.

961
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,280
Which suggests it's not pretty?

962
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,400
I'm not expecting
Bourton-on-the-Water.

963
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,920
No. Agreed.

964
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,160
Then again,
iron ore is very important

965
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,240
and Swedish iron ore
was very significant

966
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,280
to Britain's success
in the Industrial Revolution.

967
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,360
History lecture.

968
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,520
And once the Darbys
had worked out how

969
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,400
to smelt iron with coke
rather than having

970
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,720
to burn charcoal made
from wood, we were away.

971
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,760
There's actually a bit more to it
than that.

972
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,680
That was an over-simplification.

973
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,040
And yet, still,
somehow more than enough.

974
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,800
Eventually,
we arrived in the town itself.

975
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,800
That must be it.
That must be the actual mine.

976
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,360
Well, one good thing,
as this is a town,

977
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,000
and it's a sort of practical town,

978
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,240
we can stock up on all
the stuff we might need

979
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,720
to continue our journey
through the wilderness.

980
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,200
Meanwhile,
back at Ice Station Zebra,

981
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,920
I was finally making progress.

982
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,120
Fire, no use at all.

983
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,120
Hammer, only thing that works.

984
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,080
Ooh! Movement!

985
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,560
See, my mother would look at
that hole there in the window

986
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,920
and go, 'Yes, that's clear.

987
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,840
We can go to school now, Jeremy'.

988
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,920
Yes. We are away.

989
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,120
Over in Kiruna,

990
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,560
we had found the most
manly shop in the world.

991
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,320
- Oh, right, this...
- Oh, hang on.

992
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,880
Whoa!

993
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,160
No!

994
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,480
That says mining town!

995
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,400
'What do you mine?' 'Iron-ore'.

996
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,120
- That must...
- I'm going to put my car back together.

997
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,280
That is...

998
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,440
Have we shrunk or is
everybody bigger than us here?

999
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,280
- I dunno.
- Yeah.

1000
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,400
I haven't got my glasses.

1001
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,600
It's an ax.

1002
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,200
Yeah.

1003
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,880
Oh, hang on, these are like strops.

1004
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,880
This is if we get stuck, which we could
'cause we're gonna be in the wilderness.

1005
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,040
- Easy.
- These are strops

1006
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,800
and winches and things.
A ratchet strap.

1007
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,320
And we are prepared.

1008
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,880
With our survival shopping done,

1009
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,120
we went for a well-earned bite to eat.

1010
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,520
It's funny, I don't
generally go for pizzas,

1011
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,600
but sometimes...

1012
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,560
Oh, hello.

1013
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,240
You made it.

1014
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,480
Oh.

1015
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,080
What?

1016
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,440
- Would you like some pizza?
- Yes.

1017
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,920
- Did you get the ice off?
- Yeah, mostly.

1018
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,200
I bet it was fun.
That was a proper challenge.

1019
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,360
What did you do?

1020
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,080
- Flame thrower, chisel.
- We guessed fire.

1021
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,640
I hope you enjoy your pizza.

1022
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:53,680
Shall we call a truce on
silly ice-related pranks?

1023
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,280
- No.
- Okay.

1024
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,960
You can have a small piece.

1025
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,120
- Don't let him have any!
- Small piece, small piece.

1026
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,960
- Have you seen this?
- What?

1027
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,120
It's a mobile home.

1028
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,040
I'll tell you
exactly what this is.

1029
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,560
The iron ore mine, which you
may have noticed on the way in...

1030
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,120
It's hard to miss.
- Mmm.

1031
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,840
The seam is going under the town
that they're mining,

1032
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,520
and the houses are starting to...

1033
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,440
- They just disappear in the...
- Yeah, they're just falling into the hole.

1034
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,920
So they're moving the town.

1035
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,680
But there was a
whole house on a truck thing.

1036
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,880
- They just move the house.
- Yeah, pick up the house.

1037
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,800
They are moving house, literally.

1038
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,080
They pick them up,
put them on a lorry,

1039
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,960
and move them to an area
where the mine isn't.

1040
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,480
- Wow!
- There, look, you can see.

1041
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,560
Yeah.

1042
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,040
There is the seam
and the town is falling down.

1043
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,960
It gives me an idea, though.

1044
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,000
- What?
- You know those houses

1045
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,000
we saw on skis at the lake,
was it yesterday?

1046
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,240
- Hmm.
- Mm.

1047
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,240
Well, I know that once we go...

1048
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,400
Where are we going?

1049
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,200
- East of here.
- Yeah?

1050
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,120
Towards Finland
and into Finland,

1051
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,320
it does get more wildernessy
than it has been.

1052
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:03,120
Why don't we get, like, houses
and tow them behind our cars?

1053
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,200
What?

1054
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,480
- That's just a caravan.
- Actual houses?

1055
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,840
No, no, no, on skis.

1056
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,760
Well, but we can't possibly
tow a whole house behind us.

1057
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,520
Well, I'm not suggesting
we have a six-bedroom mansion.

1058
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,960
So, what are you thinking of?

1059
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:18,040
Something in between
a dog kennel and that.

1060
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,440
On skis?

1061
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,960
- It's the skis that...
- Yes, it's not some awful...

1062
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,120
You can make whatever
house you like.

1063
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,640
That is a smart idea.

1064
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,320
So with that and the
provisions we've bought,

1065
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,400
- we are good.
- Have you been shopping?

1066
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,480
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah,

1067
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,640
we've got some fantastic stuff.

1068
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:35,080
With that settled,
we found a workshop.

1069
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:42,240
And the next afternoon,
the houses were ready.

1070
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,920
Let me talk you through my genius,
if I may, Hammond.

1071
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,360
- A simple bed, fur blanket.
- Synthetic?

1072
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,920
Yeah, and then we've
got a wood-burning stove,

1073
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,560
antler lighting here,

1074
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,840
and then, external lighting
on my porch.

1075
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,200
It's a bit big, isn't it?

1076
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,720
It's not big!

1077
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,520
Well, it is compared to mine.

1078
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,560
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah!

1079
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,640
Traditional Swedish hut.
Perfect in every way, this.

1080
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:16,880
This is what they use.

1081
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,400
Look, compact living.

1082
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,040
In the middle, this is for cooking.

1083
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,720
So, air comes in underneath,
goes out that chimney at the top.

1084
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,400
- Yeah?
- Keeps the whole thing warm.

1085
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,920
This seat converts into a bed.

1086
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,160
- I've got lighting.
- Hold on. What?

1087
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,000
You have to sleep in a C shape?

1088
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,240
No, no, no, that bit goes in there
and then that comes over there.

1089
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,640
This all converts into a bed
when you're in sleeping mode,

1090
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,280
but this is sociable,
keep warm, cook food.

1091
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,720
Pretty lights, honestly...

1092
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,440
Why didn't you make
it square, though?

1093
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,760
You'd have had more space.

1094
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,440
Because they are
traditionally this shape.

1095
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,480
You sit around. I actually
have one of these at home.

1096
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,080
- Of course you do.
- For real, and it's brilliant.

1097
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,720
You have a barbecue in it
with your friends and, you know...

1098
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,400
Have you just stolen a bus shelter?

1099
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,000
Well, my thinking was
that, when I'm in bed,

1100
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,960
I can just look at the Northern Lights
without having to go outside.

1101
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,520
I wish I'd thought of that.

1102
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,240
This is a bit like those people
who go foraging for food.

1103
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,000
Isn't it?
You've gone foraging for shelter.

1104
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,760
Instead of some mushrooms,
you've come back with a bus stop.

1105
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,840
It's a clever thing.

1106
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,720
It's just, I don't particularly want
to look out of my window

1107
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,760
and see you doing man things.

1108
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,360
I'm not gonna park near you.

1109
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:31,040
Unveilings over,
it was time to hit the road.

1110
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,280
Here we go.

1111
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,120
Ooh, it's going. I have begun.

1112
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,360
We're moving.

1113
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:44,080
Well, thus far,
everything works. It's perfect.

1114
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,160
Chaps? I seem to
have frozen to the ground.

1115
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,640
Richard and I, therefore,
got out to give him a push.

1116
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,240
You ready?

1117
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,840
- What are you doing?
- Three, two, one, go!

1118
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,400
- Yes!
- Yes.

1119
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,600
Keep going, James.

1120
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,920
Thank you!

1121
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,640
I'm off.

1122
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,120
It works! It works!

1123
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,560
Oh, no. No.

1124
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,960
Oh, my word...

1125
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,400
Panic. Panic.

1126
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:48,000
It's difficult to describe
the handling of the Audi now.

1127
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,080
Worse is one way of saying it.

1128
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,760
On the plus side, however,

1129
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,960
our grand designs had
solved our housing problems.

1130
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,800
And we were now heading smoothly
towards the Finnish border.

1131
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,560
I'm a proper nomad
in the snowy wilderness.

1132
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,640
I've got my home with me.

1133
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,080
Fabulous, it's a roaming village.

1134
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,560
Hello, lovely Swedish people.

1135
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,080
Now, the sat nav
is saying to go left here.

1136
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:28,040
No!

1137
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:33,720
I nearly rolled my shed there!

1138
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,240
Buffeting.

1139
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,960
Buffeting.

1140
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,480
Oh. Steady.

1141
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,920
Jeremy, are you
sure about this turnoff?

1142
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,880
Yes. I'm not.

1143
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,400
To be honest, I'm not,
'cause my sat nav won't admit,

1144
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,480
'cause it's German,

1145
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,680
that it can only see one
or maybe two satellites.

1146
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,040
So, it doesn't really
know where it is.

1147
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,840
Thanks to the Quattro's superior power,

1148
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,960
I was soon far ahead
of the two-litre boys.

1149
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:17,360
But my heavy shed
did make my V8 a bit thirsty.

1150
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,400
God, I'm gonna need
some fuel first.

1151
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,080
Oh no, wait, a petrol station.

1152
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,280
Whoa. Ooh, deary me.

1153
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,720
Oh! Hell!

1154
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,480
Shit!

1155
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,800
I've crashed into a petrol station
is what I've done here.

1156
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,840
Oh, shit.

1157
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,760
Morning.

1158
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,000
At that moment, my colleague arrived.

1159
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,440
Right.

1160
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:58,160
And kindly volunteered
to help me out of my pickle.

1161
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,360
Shall I go?
I'll stand on it.

1162
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,360
Full-right in reverse,
It might just do it.

1163
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,800
You reckon?

1164
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,000
Ah. You see?

1165
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,280
- Yes?
- Yeah, you're all right.

1166
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,280
Keep your hard,
hard right in.

1167
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,040
Okay.

1168
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,720
And then go forwards.

1169
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,960
All right, with hindsight,
I've made a mistake.

1170
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,400
Oh...

1171
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,360
Shit!

1172
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,280
What did I hit?

1173
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,760
All those big metal bins.

1174
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,240
Have I hit the recycling bin?

1175
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,240
Yes, a number of them, in fact.

1176
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:47,720
Oh. no. Look what we've done.

1177
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,560
- We?
- It is a village notice board.

1178
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,880
Music lessons,
they do recorder lessons.

1179
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,120
- There's a kid's choir.
- Well, they, they won't notice.

1180
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,080
Well, they will,
it's on its side.

1181
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,160
Oh, it's bloody heavy.

1182
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,800
No, we're not gonna,
we're never gonna get that back up.

1183
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:06,880
It's the one thing they've got!
Snow and a notice board.

1184
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,240
Given the situation,

1185
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,960
it seemed churlish to
complain about my own damage.

1186
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,280
Ooh, that's gonna
be breezy in there now.

1187
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:19,880
So, after Mr Slowly
turned up, we left the scene,

1188
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,600
trying to draw as little attention
to ourselves as possible.

1189
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,720
Chaps, we're going the other way.

1190
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,440
Stop. We're going the other way.

1191
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,480
Well, why didn't you tell me
that before I set off?

1192
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,560
No. No. Over-jackknifed.

1193
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,560
Are we having
a barn dance now?

1194
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,800
Back on the road,
traffic was light.

1195
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,600
So, after a few miles,
we got a big giddy.

1196
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,920
Are you overtaking me, you maniac?

1197
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,920
Ski-shed racing! New thing!

1198
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,720
Oh, my God.

1199
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,600
Yeah, with hindsight,
that was a mistake.

1200
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,960
I've made it angry!

1201
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:14,720
Ooh! Bank!

1202
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,760
Oh no, there's a bus shelter
coming up on my inside.

1203
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Even James May's bus...

1204
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,520
I'm gonna take him...

1205
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,880
Oh, my word.

1206
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,240
Oh.

1207
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,360
I was a little over-exuberant.
I, yeah...

1208
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,920
Well, I haven't done
anything funnier than this

1209
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,080
in a car for a really,
really, really long time.

1210
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,800
I just hope it isn't
that sort of funny

1211
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:56,560
that ends in blood and court cases
and burst arteries.

1212
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,400
- Turn left.
- Left turn. Ooh, sudden!

1213
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,960
Shit!

1214
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,160
Oh, hell!

1215
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,760
There's a left turn,
and I've had a accident.

1216
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,560
You're a dick.

1217
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,960
Nevertheless,
for the second time in two hours,

1218
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,520
my colleague did organize a rescue.

1219
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:26,040
So if we get this strop and another strop
and take it to that tree...

1220
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,600
Stand clear.

1221
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,960
Ooh, a little,
a little tug might do it.

1222
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,200
Yeah, there you go.

1223
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,000
- Very good!
- Hoorah!

1224
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,920
Something we did worked!

1225
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Something,
like, we did it and it...

1226
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,160
I didn't do it.

1227
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,480
- We were there.
- We were there when it did it.

1228
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:06,480
There it is, the mighty shed
is once again on the move.

1229
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,800
A few miles later,
my Amstrad sat nav

1230
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,680
finally delivered us
to the Finnish border.

1231
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:24,600
Now, that is Finland over there,
on the other bank of this frozen river.

1232
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,920
This is an international border?

1233
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Yes.

1234
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:32,320
So how do people cross
between Sweden and Finland if,

1235
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,240
say, it's the summer?

1236
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,920
Yes, you raise
a good point there, James.

1237
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,720
This sat nav's taken leave of its senses.

1238
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,200
Anyway, here we go.

1239
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,680
Hello, Finland.

1240
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,920
Yeah, this is a bit more
like the real deal now.

1241
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,600
This is the wilderness.

1242
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:10,120
If we get into trouble out here, we
are a long way from anyone and anything.

1243
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,240
But it's okay.

1244
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,920
We've got our houses with us.

1245
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,960
We find a clearing in the woods
and we camp, in the wild.

1246
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:23,960
As we climbed,
dusk gave way to darkness.

1247
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,800
And then there was a storm.

1248
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:41,560
Now, this has got
a bit perilous now.

1249
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:46,080
A, it's gone dark
and B, it's a blizzard.

1250
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,320
I mean a proper blizzard.

1251
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:57,000
This is far from good now.

1252
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,720
The inside of my windscreen has iced up.

1253
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,120
I'm having to...

1254
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:16,280
No, this is just hopeless.

1255
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,160
I think we should stop here.

1256
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:22,000
I don't think we should carry on.

1257
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,880
I'm going in.
I'm gonna get my fire working.

1258
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:27,960
Shall I come and help you?

1259
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,880
By all means.

1260
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:30,960
Jesus.

1261
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,160
Oh, God.

1262
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,320
Come on.

1263
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,960
I might have put
some lighter fluid on it.

1264
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,040
Thanks for telling me.

1265
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,600
These are so cold.

1266
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,600
Thankfully, the next morning,

1267
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,880
the storm had passed.

1268
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:15,880
Oh, I'm cold.

1269
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,440
Ooh.

1270
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,440
Jesus Christ.

1271
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,520
Right, what we've done...

1272
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,160
...is camped on the ski run.

1273
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,280
And a red run,
by the looks of things.

1274
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,800
What the...

1275
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:51,880
What the...

1276
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,600
That's what you get for
encasing my car in ice, I guess.

1277
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:08,880
What?

1278
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,200
Good.

1279
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:44,680
Time to get up.

1280
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,920
Where are we?

1281
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,920
Now, that's interesting.

1282
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
It turns out we're in a ski resort.

1283
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,640
- What?
- I know.

1284
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,440
Jeez.

1285
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,920
Oh, God, it's a good job
we stopped when we did.

1286
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,080
I know.

1287
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,880
Hammond's already at the bottom.

1288
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,000
What? How?

1289
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,320
On his skis?

1290
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,600
Yeah, and his shed.

1291
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,160
His shed went down the bottom?

1292
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:20,120
Yeah, I might have given
a little bit of a push.

1293
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,240
- A tiny push.
- You pushed his shed down the hill?

1294
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:26,320
Well, I thought he, 'cause he always
said he wanted to go skiing.

1295
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,320
Well, ignore him,
we've got the big problem,

1296
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:33,880
'cause we've somehow
got to tow these down there.

1297
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,440
And that's a red run.

1298
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,880
Actually, I had the big problem,

1299
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:48,000
because my house was now ruined
and I needed to get up to my car.

1300
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,400
This meant using the pulling thing
that skiers use.

1301
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:55,800
And the problem there was, I can't ski.

1302
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:01,680
Skis? No.

1303
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,560
More skis.

1304
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,840
Snowboards.

1305
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,120
No.

1306
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,160
Oh, hang on.

1307
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:11,960
Yes.

1308
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,880
Meanwhile, back at the top,

1309
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:27,320
I was trying to hitch
my car up to my bus shelter.

1310
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:38,960
Bugger!

1311
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:43,440
Right, my plan, to try and stop

1312
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:47,280
my very long sledge slewing round

1313
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:51,840
is to attach cables to the corner here
and the corner there

1314
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,240
and the corner there
and the corner there

1315
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,080
to keep it straight.

1316
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,240
Sorry.

1317
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,440
Sorry.

1318
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Sorry.

1319
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:43,320
Right. Hang on. Right hand down, back,
a bit of left, a bit of right, line up.

1320
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,240
Oh, shit!

1321
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,320
Shit!

1322
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,040
Jesus!

1323
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,680
Ah! No!

1324
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,560
Oh.

1325
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,560
This left just me
and two sheds.

1326
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,200
Oh, for God's sake.

1327
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:10,040
Right. Oh, it's Hammond.

1328
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,440
Hammond?
Could you give us a hand?

1329
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:16,680
No.

1330
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,880
Having finally
got my shed hitched,

1331
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,240
I was ready to go.

1332
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:48,320
Right. Is everything in order?

1333
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,400
Traction control is off. Good.

1334
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,040
Jeremy, are you actually
coming down here today at all?

1335
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,560
I'm coming.
It's very difficult.

1336
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:59,240
Because I've got a shed
on the back of my car.

1337
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:01,600
Lights? Yeah.

1338
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,680
Straps are on. Oh, shit!

1339
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,960
Traction control is off.

1340
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:11,520
Here we go.

1341
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,520
Take this steadily.

1342
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,240
That's what I've gotta do, steady.

1343
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,800
Keep it straight, Jeremy.
Keep it straight.

1344
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,640
Er, your shed's on fire.

1345
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,880
How have I done this?

1346
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,280
No, stopping not possible.

1347
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,720
I'm speeding up.

1348
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,120
Trying to put the flames out that way,

1349
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,320
like they did in 'Memphis Belle'.

1350
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:49,200
All right, I'm gonna try
and understeer my way to a halt.

1351
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,640
Oh, God.

1352
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,160
I think it
might have something

1353
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:00,880
- to do with your flaming exhaust.
- Shit!

1354
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,520
Once the fire had been put out...

1355
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,320
...I inspected the damage.

1356
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,240
Oh, Christ. Burned.

1357
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,000
- Well, at least it's warm now.
- The straps worked.

1358
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,000
- Yeah, but...
- But, no, no, stop and just,

1359
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,920
before you get
onto your negativity...

1360
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Okay?

1361
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,000
These straps stopped it.

1362
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,320
You know, all the way here,
it was slewing round all the time?

1363
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,560
- That solved the problem.
- Good thinking.

1364
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,120
- Exactly.
- But as a result of that,

1365
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,120
it's survived for you
to sleep in another night.

1366
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,960
Oh, well, this has gone well.

1367
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,680
We were all now homeless.

1368
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,120
And we had another problem.

1369
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,720
The airport may have only
been a hundred miles away,

1370
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,920
but making it on time in Finland,

1371
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,240
which has the toughest
speeding laws in the world,

1372
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,360
would be tricky.

1373
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:01,960
It did give me an idea, though.

1374
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:06,160
Listen. What we've established
is the Audi is the only car

1375
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:09,320
that can pull a sledge down a red run.

1376
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,680
And set it on fire and destroy it.

1377
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,120
Yes, yes, yes, but it's
the only one that did it.

1378
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,720
Yours didn't.

1379
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:18,160
I'm doing a thorough test on this car.

1380
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,880
And actually, to be honest, early on,

1381
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:23,160
May was doing
a very thorough test on the Evo.

1382
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:24,360
So come on, Hammond.

1383
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,240
Show us how fast the Subaru goes.

1384
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,600
I'm not doing that here.

1385
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,320
Why not?

1386
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,320
Because they are
properly next-level strict on speeding.

1387
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,160
They don't just
access your records

1388
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:39,320
to see if your car's taxed,

1389
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,920
they look at your tax returns
to see how much you earn

1390
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,720
and then fine you accordingly.

1391
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,640
He's right. They do.

1392
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:51,120
It's true. A Finnish sausage magnate
was fined 116,000 pounds

1393
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,960
for doing 80 kilometres
in a 40-kilometre zone.

1394
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,800
They are serious about it.

1395
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,800
Come on, Hammond.
You can afford it.

1396
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,000
Put your foot down.
See how fast you can make it go.

1397
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:02,360
I am not,

1398
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,080
even I am not falling for that.
No.

1399
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,760
Because of the speed limits,

1400
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,960
I was worried we'd miss our flight.

1401
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:16,080
But then I had a brainwave.

1402
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,880
Well, we can't go
quickly on the roads,

1403
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:20,880
but we can go
quickly on this lake,

1404
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:25,560
which actually stretches
a long way towards the airport.

1405
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,200
Okey doke. Here we go.

1406
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,960
Speed and power.

1407
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,320
You see?
No speed limits here.

1408
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:49,600
The swine! He cut me off
like a maniac and a yobbo.

1409
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,720
You can't get me.

1410
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,800
You should try
driving over here. It's all flat.

1411
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,680
Oh, shit!

1412
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,360
F***

1413
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,040
James has
gone through, everyone.

1414
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:06,240
- Shit!
- James has gone through.

1415
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,520
Don't move.

1416
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:14,680
F***

1417
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,080
Shit.

1418
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:24,680
Can you get out?

1419
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,400
Are you on the bottom?

1420
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,160
I mean, is he just, is it
the ice underneath him?

1421
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:32,960
It could just be on a rock.

1422
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,040
Ow!

1423
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:42,280
James, what's happened
is your front spoiler

1424
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:45,240
is wedged in what looks
like still-intact ice.

1425
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:51,240
That's against
a rock or the ice.

1426
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:55,640
Oh, my ribs.

1427
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,160
Right, you're pretty much out,

1428
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:00,200
if you can get on the boot lid.

1429
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,400
I mean, do you think the car
is just sitting on a plate of ice?

1430
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,960
No, I think it's just
wedged in some ice.

1431
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:10,080
If it goes down, I'll swim for it,
but we've gotta save the car.

1432
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,520
Find a way of dragging the car out.

1433
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,880
If you drag the car out,
I'll come with it.

1434
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,360
Have you,
we got, you've got a tow.

1435
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,080
- Something I've...
- Yeah, but we can't get

1436
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,720
close enough to pull it out with your,
with our cars, can we?

1437
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,320
No, I'm not driving any nearer.

1438
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,520
No, no, no, no, no, no,
I'm not gonna go near, but...

1439
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,320
Don't drive any closer than there.

1440
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,920
We're not going to.
So the tow rope is out.

1441
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,680
But I have got tools.

1442
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,040
Right, let's go
and think what we've got.

1443
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,440
- That's halfway up the lights there.
- Yeah, okay, let's look at tools.

1444
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,080
Mate, I saw a video, don't laugh.

1445
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:44,440
But you know I like sort of, you know,
recovery and off-roading and stuff?

1446
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:45,560
Yes.

1447
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,400
I was watching them
do an ice recovery.

1448
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,960
There's a way of doing this.

1449
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,560
You can use a tree as a winch.

1450
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:56,920
Don't go away, James.
We'll be right back.

1451
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,760
Oh, no, I was gonna
go for a coffee.

1452
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,240
This is a rescue mission.

1453
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,600
I reckon there's just a chance
this could still go again,

1454
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:29,840
if it didn't hydraulic the engine.

1455
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,000
But we've gotta get it out. It's...
Oh, God.

1456
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,280
I don't believe it's ready to go.

1457
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,120
It's a survivor.

1458
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:52,720
- So, what's the plan?
- Oh, he's got one.

1459
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,800
I don't understand it,
I'm gonna be honest with you.

1460
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,400
Saw this on the internet.

1461
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:05,440
I've gone through.

1462
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,440
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1463
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,960
Right, you have a bridge to escape.

1464
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,280
When are you gonna
say 'thank you'?

1465
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,880
Well, it hasn't worked yet.

1466
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,920
Is there a way we can get
the car out but leave him there?

1467
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,280
- I reckon that's good.
- Right. May?

1468
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:33,120
Give this a really good knot
and attach it to the tow bar, yeah?

1469
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,440
Yeah, okay.

1470
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,200
Ow!

1471
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:45,520
- You're on.
- Yes?

1472
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,040
Is that it, Hammond?

1473
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,720
Yeah. It's built.

1474
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,080
What?
So it's just a log in a hole?

1475
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,440
- Yep.
- Tied to another log?

1476
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,880
Yep.

1477
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:57,800
And you reckon
that's gonna be enough

1478
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:00,680
to pull a ton and a half of car that's...

1479
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:01,760
Oh, yeah.

1480
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:04,240
I think that log
in the middle's turning.

1481
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,320
Yeah, it's supposed to.

1482
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,800
- Oh, is it?
- That's the winch.

1483
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:10,200
The log in the middle turns
and winds in the rope.

1484
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:12,960
Actually, Hammond,
you know what?

1485
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,120
- It's working.
- It's working!

1486
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:17,120
I mean, I'm genuinely staggered,

1487
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,200
'cause that is ice,
but, yeah, look at that.

1488
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,840
Right, we've gotta get him off.

1489
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,880
Can you put
the log between there

1490
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:24,760
and the driver's seat?

1491
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:27,880
And then I can climb across
the door to the nice bit, onto the land.

1492
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,920
He is rescued.

1493
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,120
Right, thank you.

1494
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,880
Did the engine,
as far as you know, go under water?

1495
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:45,200
I don't think it did.

1496
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:48,680
So we've got to try
and keep the engine above water.

1497
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:50,600
- Let's do it.
- Let's just do it.

1498
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:52,000
We have got to just
get cracking, seriously.

1499
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,040
We started winching,

1500
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:00,320
praying that whatever
was holding the car up

1501
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,280
would keep the engine out of the water.

1502
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,640
What's the breaking strain
of the rope?

1503
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:10,440
I don't know. It's just rope.

1504
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,600
Oh, shit, it's gone in!

1505
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:18,000
The car's gone in at the front.

1506
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,720
Okay.

1507
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,160
It's dropped off the edge?

1508
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:22,240
Yeah.

1509
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,400
Right, we really have got
a bit of a rush on now

1510
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,880
'cause the engine's
in the water.

1511
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:27,080
Okay.

1512
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,440
- It's moving! Look!
- It is!

1513
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:41,440
Once the back
of the car was far enough out,

1514
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,840
it was time for
the next part of my plan.

1515
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,520
Like this?

1516
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,760
- Hammond?
- Yeah, that's correct.

1517
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,160
Jeremy, are you ready?

1518
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,080
Two secs.

1519
01:29:58,200 --> 01:29:59,280
The car's moving!

1520
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,680
- It is under tension now.
- The car's moving.

1521
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:08,680
Ooh, brake lights.
Why have the brake lights just come on?

1522
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:10,520
Electrics. Fusing.

1523
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:16,360
Right. James?

1524
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,760
- Yeah?
- Your engine is out.

1525
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,200
The biggest problem is,
it's stuck on the frame.

1526
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,480
But, as it was now out of the hole,

1527
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:29,440
I could get close enough
to use my V8.

1528
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,040
Stop. Stop.

1529
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,040
Right, you're on. There you go.

1530
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,200
Another one.

1531
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,920
- That'll do it. That'll do it.
- That is out!

1532
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,360
What a car this is.

1533
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,040
It's yanked the Evo out.

1534
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:54,160
It's saved the Evo's life.
You beauty.

1535
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,720
But the question was, had it?

1536
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,640
- Oh.
- Oh, shit.

1537
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,880
- Look at the off headlamp.
- Oh, God.

1538
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,280
Right, well,
what you've got, James,

1539
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,000
plainly, is some work to do.

1540
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:14,040
- Yep.
- Hammond, what you and I have got to do

1541
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:15,360
is catch this plane home.

1542
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:17,160
Yes. Team comes first.

1543
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:20,400
The team comes first.
We have been a team.

1544
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,120
Thank you for that.

1545
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,720
We'll see you in something.

1546
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,640
Volvo.

1547
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,280
I can't see him
fixing that this time.

1548
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:41,000
It's a tough little car, that Evo,

1549
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:42,800
and I love it,
but I think it's dead.

1550
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:47,400
We are running late
for this plane!

1551
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:50,000
Come on, come on.

1552
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:57,080
The lake gave way
to fast forest tracks.

1553
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:03,240
Which were the perfect environment
to sum up our cars.

1554
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:07,880
If I can liken them to dogs,
and I think I can,

1555
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:09,960
the Evo is like a rescue dog.

1556
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:14,680
It's been appallingly mistreated
by its irresponsible owner,

1557
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:17,000
and you sort of love it for that.

1558
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:22,160
Then there's the Subaru,
which is like an endearing

1559
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:26,600
but ultimately quite annoying terrier.

1560
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:34,960
And then there's the Audi Quattro,
which is like a Labrador,

1561
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:39,720
brilliant at absolutely everything.

1562
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:43,360
A Quattro is not just for Christmas.

1563
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,160
A Quattro is for life.

1564
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:58,120
I'm not saying the Subaru
can do everything,

1565
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:03,000
adapt to fit the captain of industry
and the bar-brawler within you.

1566
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:07,200
It doesn't. You have to change
to fit it, and that's the point.

1567
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:10,520
The most mild-mannered vicar in the world

1568
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:13,080
could leave the pulpit
with kind words for his flock,

1569
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,640
hop into a Subaru Impreza,

1570
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,880
and he would drive,
well, like this.

1571
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:24,880
Ooh, 'cause that's what it does!

1572
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:40,240
We then got on
with our charge to the plane.

1573
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:46,400
Right, that is the perimeter fence
for the airport.

1574
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,240
Somewhere in there is our plane.

1575
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:54,840
I'm now in Where Eagles Dare.

1576
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,680
Oh, my word. A machine!

1577
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,240
What an arrival.

1578
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,760
That's gotta be it.

1579
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,400
- Fancy plane!
- Yeah. Nice finish line.

1580
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:39,120
Isn't it?

1581
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:41,880
We'd actually got here
faster than expected,

1582
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:44,880
which meant we now had
a bit of time to kill

1583
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:47,160
while waiting for James.

1584
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:49,000
I was just thinking,
driving along,

1585
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:54,720
if your car was originally
designed to do rallying,

1586
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,000
it's going to be pretty good,
whatever it is.

1587
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,920
How would you know?

1588
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,120
Well, it wasn't
designed to do rallying,

1589
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,200
- was it?
- It was!

1590
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,360
Did you look in your rear-view mirror

1591
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:07,120
at any point in the last 40 minutes?

1592
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,600
Yes, there was
an enormous Audi in it,

1593
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:11,040
but not a rally car.

1594
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:14,120
Your problem is
you're not very observant.

1595
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:15,480
What?

1596
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:17,840
What?

1597
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,080
- Did you do that?
- Yes.

1598
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:21,240
Have you done the doors as well?

1599
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:22,400
- Yes.
- Oh, bloody hell.

1600
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:23,480
And your windscreen.

1601
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:26,200
Oh, come on, I thought I looked cool.

1602
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:27,560
- You did.
- No, it didn't!

1603
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:29,280
Everyone was going,
'There's a Martin Clunes fan'.

1604
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,920
Or Martin Bashir.

1605
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,320
Revelations dealt with,

1606
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:36,760
we then waited to see
what James would arrive in.

1607
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:41,600
And a short while later...

1608
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:46,400
Is that him?

1609
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,120
- And if it is...
- What's he in?

1610
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:53,360
Is it the Mitsubishi?
Or is it the Volvo?

1611
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:55,920
Is that the Volvo?

1612
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:58,200
It was the Volvo.

1613
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:02,360
And I wasn't in it.

1614
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:06,680
What? Oh, my God!

1615
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:10,560
Yes, what a car!

1616
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:13,360
That is extraordinary!

1617
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:16,880
How the bloody hell
is that possible?

1618
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,760
It's totally wounded,
but it's here!

1619
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:29,000
We worried
when we began this journey

1620
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:31,200
that it'd be a bit nerdy.

1621
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:33,480
But it wasn't.

1622
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:35,000
And we sincerely hope

1623
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:38,760
that all of you have found
these rally-bred titans

1624
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:40,760
as amazing as we have.

1625
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,400
You beauty.

1626
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:51,680
They're cars that put up
with all of our nonsense,

1627
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:54,360
never once losing their majesty.

1628
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:01,080
But there's absolutely no doubt

1629
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:04,160
about the real hero of this adventure.

1630
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:12,920
The Evo died, not once but twice.

1631
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:18,600
No way.

1632
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:21,720
And both times,
it rose from the dead...

1633
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,760
...and soldiered on.

1634
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,000
Oh!

1635
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,960
That's why the Evo
and its traveling companions

1636
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:35,120
are exactly the sort of cars a show
like this is honoured to honour.

1637
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:49,040
Hi, there.

1638
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:03,120
Shore to Jeremy, Richard, James.

1639
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:04,760
- They're here.
- Why have they gone down there?

1640
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:06,200
They're getting further away.

1641
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:07,360
- I'm losing them.
- What?

1642
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:13,200
Guys, you're supposed
just to taxi round.

1643
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:17,560
What the...

1644
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:19,680
They're not supposed
to be on that. That's a prop.

1645
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:22,840
They're not supposed to take off.

1646
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:27,080
They're supposed to be on that one.
