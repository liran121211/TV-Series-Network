1
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,460
I said you would love my surprise. 

2
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
Yasemin ... 

3
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,020
... you ... 

4
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,380
... I have to tell you something. 

5
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,920
Very important. 

6
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,520
I'm listening. 

7
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,380
I'll tell you clearly, Yasemin. 

8
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,940
Everything happened suddenly, Yasemin. 

9
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
Something happened. 

10
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,400
What could we do with love? 

11
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,040
Even the music must be silent sometimes in love. 

12
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,980
You have to fall in love. 

13
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,440
Applaud our composer Derin Düdenli. 

14
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,859
Are you okay? 

15
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,900
Thanks for everything. 

16
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,100
You were very good. 

17
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,520
What would you say? 

18
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,040
Mom, I'm going to sing. 

19
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,040
Darling of course. 

20
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,520
Do you want to sing too? 

21
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,740
I think there is a little princess among us who wants to celebrate her father's birthday. 

22
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,380
With your permission.

23
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,760
Let's run. 

24
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,580
Happy Birthday Dad. 

25
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,719
Happy Birthday Dad. 

26
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,419
Happy birthday, happy birthday ... 

27
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,700
... happy birthday dad. 

28
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,719
My dear well done, how beautiful you said. 

29
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,220
With your permission. 

30
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
Are you okay? 

31
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,340
Not bad. 

32
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,120
Bahar has recovered so well that it would have disgraced me. 

33
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,340
Don't worry, nobody understood anything. 

34
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
How are your hands? 

35
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,080
As if I didn't feel anything. 

36
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,880
Look ... 

37
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,740
... we're leaving tomorrow, okay? 

38
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,560
Congratulations. 

39
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,280
Thanks. 

40
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,520
I have never seen anything so beautiful. 

41
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,180
Especially that trip you took at the end ... 

42
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,300
... No matter how proud Yasemin is with you. 

43
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
Thanks. 

44
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,260
With your permission ...

45
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,960
I'll come soon, okay. 

46
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,920
I admire the color of your voice. 

47
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,600
Thank you. 

48
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,480
Sorry, I'm taking Bahar for two minutes. 

49
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,600
Where? 

50
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,700
Great date. 

51
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,680
But. 

52
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,940
Look who I brought you. 

53
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,620
I want to introduce you to Bahar. 

54
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,340
Your voice is tremendous miss. 

55
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,199
Thank you. 

56
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,320
No, no seriously, they all passed out. 

57
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,740
You have become the surprise of the night. It is not? 

58
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,520
Sorry, I got together, but ... 

59
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,480
... Ma'am, what a beautiful voice this is. 

60
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,100
I mean, I was surprised, you are great. 

61
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,900
Thank you. 

62
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,400
One minute. 

63
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,380
But I know you from somewhere, but I couldn't get it out. 

64
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
I do not know. 

65
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,640
It could be from anywhere, right?

66
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,479
No, no, I do not forget the face that I saw again, but. 

67
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,020
Maybe somewhere you sing. 

68
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,460
Possible ... 

69
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,800
... I have a small fan base. 

70
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,600
Could be. 

71
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,640
What do you put on the man Ruhir? 

72
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,360
Now, if you'll excuse me, I want to speak to our people. 

73
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,020
OK. 

74
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,760
What are you doing? 

75
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,340
We are fine, we were talking about life. 

76
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,579
Where are you? I could not see you. 

77
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,960
Cemil and his wife came and hung them up a bit, they sold the house in Sapanca. 

78
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
Sapanca ... 

79
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,620
... if we say Sapanca, are we going somewhere on the weekend? 

80
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,480
Wait a minute, I was going to talk something. 

81
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,260
If I want your permission? 

82
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,820
I don't feel very good either. 

83
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
Are you okay?

84
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,060
My stomach got a little sick but it happens when I rest. 

85
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,000
Are we going to look for something like a drug? 

86
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,580
Don't bother, thank you. 

87
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:12,980
Good night. 

88
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,900
Good night. 

89
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,060
Good night Miss. 

90
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,880
I say Sapanca, let's go somewhere. 

91
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,560
I think it's a great idea. 

92
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,380
How much did they sell? 

93
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,680
I don't know, I didn't ask him. 

94
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,640
What are you doing here? 

95
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,040
You're invited. 

96
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,180
Didn't you text me like my birthday? 

97
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,160
Look, what kind of game is this, I say I don't like it at all. 

98
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,260
Surprise. 

99
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,420
What? 

100
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,900
There is no game Murat. 

101
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,840
The surprise is a surprise that your wife made you. 

102
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
So sorry. 

103
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
What? 

104
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,780
Ain't it funny how your wife's surprise is me

105
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,320
I'm surprised by this surprise ... 

106
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,800
... I didn't like it at all. 

107
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,560
And your own home too? 

108
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,760
You missed me so much. 

109
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Go. 

110
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,600
Ah Baharcım ... 

111
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,079
Congratulations on how good you were or we love the voice in the last part, right? 

112
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,140
We love the final vocal part, right? 

113
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
Yes. 

114
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,780
Husband and wife are very nice. 

115
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,640
Murat Bey liked it too. 

116
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
He also loved your surprise. 

117
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,680
Isn't that right, Murat Bey? 

118
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,720
Very nice song. 

119
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,100
I am very happy with your liking. 

120
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,780
With your permission, I ... 

121
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
... will use the sink upstairs. 

122
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,580
Of course. 

123
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,739
Very sweet girl. 

124
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:44,319
He was going to say something that he was looking at Derin. You tried to say something.

125
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Yasemin ... 

126
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,140
... I ... 

127
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,980
... let's talk now, not the time ... 

128
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,116
... at the first opportunity. 

129
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,140
Well. 

130
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,900
Are you okay? 

131
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
I'm good. 

132
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,220
What are you doing? 

133
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
My job. 

134
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,660
Your work? 

135
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,320
How much do you care about yourself? 

136
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,819
Have you been taken? 

137
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,500
Are you using my son to approach me with two grams of your brain? 

138
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,240
I resolved the situation, parenting ... 

139
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,380
... I have no business with you after this time. 

140
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,720
As for her son ... 

141
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,740
... it was because you threatened my mother ... 

142
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,380
... you can think of as insurance. 

143
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,860
If you don't touch my mom ... 

144
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,560
I don't have to talk to your son. 

145
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Meanwhile ... 

146
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,320
... keep in mind that I'm not like Sema.

147
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,900
Well ... 

148
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,680
well, little devil. 

149
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,640
Since the bathroom is full downstairs, it must have been empty here. 

150
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,780
I will update my makeup my photos should be nice, right? 

151
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,180
It is. 

152
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,900
What happened dear, what happened? 

153
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,520
Should we be long or delayed? 

154
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,040
No sugar, it would be a shame if the cake has not been cut yet. 

155
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,420
Oh yeah. 

156
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,920
We will go to the exit. 

157
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,840
You find Onur disappeared again. 

158
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,180
It's fine. Sitare. 

159
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,600
Where can I find Onur? 

160
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,180
This is not something to be neglected. 

161
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,180
We go to the doctor first thing in the morning, I don't want any objection, okay? 

162
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,300
Well. 

163
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,760
Okay, let's go. 

164
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,079
Did you see Bahar? 

165
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,240
No, you didn't speak the last one?

166
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,440
Where did this girl go? 

167
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,740
As he is the star of the night, Onur accepts the celebrations. 

168
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,400
I am arriving right now. 

169
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
Bahar. 

170
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,420
Brother Murat. 

171
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,480
Um ... 

172
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,280
... I looked. 

173
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,360
It was a beautiful song, I said thank you. Did you see Bahar Hanım? 

174
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,820
No, i have not seen it. 

175
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,720
What are you doing here? 

176
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,740
I was going to bring a cardigan for Derin. 

177
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,520
Do not go cold my beautiful daughter. 

178
00:17:07,618 --> 00:17:08,618
Thanks brother. 

179
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:22,540
Tonight would never have been so beautiful if her soul hadn't worked so hard to spy on us like this. 

180
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,520
Yasemin with pleasure. 

181
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,500
He is the man of spiritual details, he can help you whenever you want. 

182
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,780
Murat ... 

183
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,940
... We are here.

184
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,160
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the hero of the night has arrived too. 

185
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,800
You're very lucky Murat, this whole team has officially destroyed them for you. 

186
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,300
Thanks to my wife every year. 

187
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,620
Yasemin, I'll have you a drink. 

188
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,740
No. 

189
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,080
What would you drink please? 

190
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,620
Water. 

191
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,200
I am reaching the water. 

192
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,820
My life ... 

193
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,800
... Is there a problem? 

194
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,480
No, I'm looking at it. 

195
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,320
Yasemin. 

196
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,180
Thank you. 

197
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,580
Please enjoy your food. 

198
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,880
What are you doing here? 

199
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Nothing. 

200
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,120
Isn't that my cardigan? 

201
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,040
Yes, the air got cold, don't you put it on? 

202
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,260
Look at the cake, come on. 

203
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,900
Now tonight ... 

204
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,280
... Murat ... 

205
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
... complete ...

206
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,639
... no no, I won't say exactly how old you were. 

207
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,639
Of course, no one here tonight will know how old Murat is. 

208
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,740
But all of you ... 

209
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,240
... there is something I really want you to learn ... 

210
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,800
... because we have it ... 

211
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,680
... this is what keeps us alive ... 

212
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,820
... for incredible years ... 

213
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,260
... because he's so skinny, he's very attentive, so as a family ... 

214
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,260
... we want to thank him very much. 

215
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,660
Muratcığım cut the cake. 

216
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
Pie. 

217
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,100
Here you have. 

218
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,300
Ruhi ... 

219
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,780
... this is not cherry. 

220
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,840
Muratcığım you don't like cherries. 

221
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,380
Me? 

222
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,979
I don't like cherries. 

223
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,680
I don't like tart cherry friends. 

224
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,400
Maybe I was going to have cherry this year.

225
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,540
How do you know? 

226
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,280
My daughter, I don't like cherry. 

227
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,760
Girl, I don't like cherries. 

228
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,680
What if we can come get this cake and get it out? 

229
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
Yasemin ... 

230
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,800
Why isn't the cake cherry? 

231
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:14,020
Murat doesn't like a fruit cake, Ruhi made it to sabotage, I guess you can eat it. 

232
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,680
My wife, maybe you wanted to eat cherries this year, my wife, you ... 

233
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,100
... right? 

234
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,420
Doesn't your soul want to have cherry once in your life? 

235
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,460
I don't understand why this cherry is a question and why they laughed so hard. 

236
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,460
I'll tell you later, dear. 

237
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,676
What can Murat tell you about this cherry joke? 

238
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,140
With my wife between us. 

239
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,180
I'll explain, I'll explain 

240
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,879
Well.

241
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,899
Let's have a lot of fun, eat the cake, and go to bed right away. 

242
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,300
But today is my father's birthday. 

243
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,800
That's right, my daughter, sleep late tonight. 

244
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
Mrs. Filiz. 

245
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,459
It's not possible, you know Murat. 

246
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,760
We are going to bring them here. 

247
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,220
Oh God, I'm so sorry. 

248
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,120
Nothing daughter. 

249
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,460
I Sitareci. 

250
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,460
Thanks, sweetie. 

251
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
Did you take my soul? 

252
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,939
Thanks Yasemin. 

253
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,699
I raise the glass to my dear wife, my friends first ... 

254
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,860
... thank you all very much, you bothered to come to this surprise party. 

255
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
My dear wife is good. 

256
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,200
Who thinks what to eat for us ... 

257
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,520
... who decides when to go to bed, who thinks more of us than we do? ...

258
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:04,440
... I am drinking for my dear wife. It is good that you are my wife. What would we do without you? 

259
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,040
Enough, Yasemin ... 

260
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
... that's enough ... 

261
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,940
When will this torture end? 

262
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,660
Look, today is my birthday. 

263
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,840
My birthday is mine today. 

264
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,220
Isn't there a kiss? 

265
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,940
My gift was there ... 

266
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
... but ... 

267
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,919
... you're mad at something again ... 

268
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,600
... and you're going to punish me again, right? 

269
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,100
I did not do this. 

270
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,240
What is this enough? What is this for the love of God? 

271
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,600
My husband, I want to kiss you or what is in you? 

272
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,180
What is it and why are you doing this to me and why? 

273
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,320
I'm so tired, Murat, let me be alone. 

274
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,419
You are always tired. 

275
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,120
You are tired...

276
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,900
... you are always far away. 

277
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,980
You laugh alongside people with your laughter and have fun while you are alone ... 

278
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,080
... wall ... 

279
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,540
... you are like a wall. 

280
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,660
What do you expect me to do? 

281
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,320
Did I scold you in people, Murat? 

282
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,919
Did I just talk like you? 

283
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,520
I don't understand why you are drinking so much. 

284
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,000
Look at you, you can't stand. 

285
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,060
Murat you have children ... 

286
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,880
... you have a wife Murat ... 

287
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,879
... your dignity is important to me. 

288
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,240
I want to protect my dignity, I cannot be a mask on people like you. 

289
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,580
Be our friend, what if we had a little drink? 

290
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,780
Is that a little bit? 

291
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,480
Yes small. 

292
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,260
Murat stand up ... 

293
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,920
... you smell like carrion. 

294
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,439
Please see what happens.

295
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,340
Get away from me. 

296
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,679
You can't treat me like that, Yasemin, your husband, I am. 

297
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,679
Please let's go. 

298
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,180
Drop it. 

299
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:13,680
It's enough or enough, enough Yasemin is enough, what stupidity is enough or ... 

300
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:21,220
... what did I do to you? When will your eyes clear me, when, why are you doing this to us? Why? 

301
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,720
Leave me alone. 

302
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,900
Well. 

303
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:35,499
- Come, that's enough. - Leave me alone. 

304
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,520
God. 

305
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,419
What happened? Something happened? 

306
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,900
Leave me alone. 

307
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,600
Leave it alone. 

308
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,260
Let me see this. 

309
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Derin ... 

310
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,320
Didn't you go to bed? 

311
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,980
Mom, are you okay? 

312
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,419
I'm fine, I'm fine, my feet got stuck, I hit my head against the wall, my lamb. 

313
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,180
I'm fine, I'll look at Ece. 

314
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,060
Okay, I'll take care of Ece.

315
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,500
I'll take care. 

316
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,680
Hello daughter. 

317
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,020
Come on, go to bed, dear. 

318
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,300
Take it dear. 

319
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,320
Thanks. 

320
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,899
Good morning daughter, these cheeses will be finished. 

321
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
My life ... 

322
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,400
... everything was great last night ... 

323
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,320
... thanks for everything. 

324
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,159
You are very tired for me. 

325
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,480
No, I didn't do it alone, the girls also helped a lot. 

326
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,020
But if Derin isn't deep, it wouldn't be so beautiful if he didn't write that song. 

327
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
Thanks daughter. 

328
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
Oh, take this. 

329
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,980
What to your head mother? 

330
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,440
Nothing. 

331
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,140
I accidentally hit my life. 

332
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,440
I have to go out, a request? 

333
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,340
No dad. 

334
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
See you later. 

335
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,220
See you honey. 

336
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,660
See you honey.

337
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,460
I forgot what to say to these guys ... 

338
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,400
... folding the ornaments ... 

339
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,520
... removing them. 

340
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,060
You officially destroyed the plan. 

341
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,940
No, I don't understand why you ran after me now, why are you giving up? 

342
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,460
And what is the disappearance? How did I call? Why don't you open your phone? 

343
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,600
Don't you understand that my stomach was wrong? 

344
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,299
What kind of liar are you? 

345
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,400
... What disease did you invent to escape from there? 

346
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,760
Well, I made it up, I made it up, and I went home. 

347
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,480
It's good because? 

348
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,080
What would happen when he explained? 

349
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,720
... your mother never gives up on your father. 

350
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,299
Especially for a juvenile bug like me. 

351
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,520
Since the party made such an exit, we were going to be in a small state, something would not change for me.

352
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,080
Then they would throw me in the corner again. 

353
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Yes, you are right. 

354
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,580
Do you have any suggestion? 

355
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,220
We need to get into the vein. 

356
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,880
We can't get anywhere with such naive movements, do we understand that we have to suffer this man? 

357
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:33,340
We need to get your money, power, everything, so I don't know, you don't want it anyway? 

358
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,320
Ay Şekerim officially stretched the woman like a drum, I have not seen such a bad operation. 

359
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:25,600
It was so bad that I didn't really know what to say or what to do, the woman flowed at some point. 

360
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,500
Her husband went to the Maldives with his secretary, or the rest of the woman was shocked. 

361
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:39,700
Meanwhile, Sitareci were amazing, thank you so much so they officially saved the night. 

362
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,200
I would like my sweet.

363
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,779
What did you do then? 

364
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,920
What? 

365
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,700
What will it be, Yasemin? 

366
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,560
... flowers, strawberries at night. 

367
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,100
Yes, tell me, you have the real news. 

368
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,920
I ... 

369
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,900
... We now ... 

370
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,500
... sorry, the door knocked. 

371
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,900
Here you are. 

372
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,180
Hello. 

373
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:05,800
Hello. 

374
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,200
I brought Ms. Yasemin's dress. 

375
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,279
He's at home? 

376
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,380
Here you are. 

377
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,320
Bahar has arrived. 

378
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
Hello everybody. 

379
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:23,540
Sorry I forgot to leave the dress when I got sick early last night. 

380
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,259
Yes, yes, we have seen that it was bad, we will be angry. 

381
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,840
It doesn't matter now, are you okay? 

382
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,920
I'm fine, I'm fine, thank you. 

383
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:36,460
Not at all, he was in no rush. Filiz Hanımcığım, can you take this and go up? 

384
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,860
We were going to have tea now.

385
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,940
I am not upset. 

386
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:48,880
Oh by the way, I forgot to give this in a hurry for Murat Bey's birthday. 

387
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:05,040
It's so kind, Bahar, I insist, come on, come and sit with us. 

388
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,880
Come on, please sit down. 

389
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,840
Hurry? 

390
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,080
How good we were boiling, we know them both. 

391
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,340
Well. 

392
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,480
If you insist. 

393
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,100
Alo and what did you think again? 

394
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,100
Nothing at all. 

395
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,920
Come on, Figen Hodja says he doesn't take the rest. 

396
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:44,740
The woman put me on the head, I have no fingers, and while I was working the other day, my hand was officially closed. 

397
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,000
But at the prom I had such a seat that the bottom of the woman will fall off. 

398
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,560
Come on, what are you waiting for? 

399
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,980
I am not going to class. 

400
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,660
Why is that?

401
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:00,420
My stomach is nauseous or I'm not feeling very well, so I can go home and get some rest. 

402
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,080
Okay, you know, I'm running away. 

403
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,840
What a pretty surprise. 

404
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,259
It's not a surprise or something, you know that very well, we're going to the hospital. 

405
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,420
Well, I have a lesson. 

406
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,440
Derin ... 

407
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:30,600
... I even got the appointment, it's too late for you to sneak out of this job. 

408
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,960
Come on, never put on your beautiful face. 

409
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,359
Ms. Filiz is not the same team with these tea spoons and cutlery alone. 

410
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,320
I am sorry, I mistook. 

411
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,980
Okay, it doesn't matter, and if you fold these napkins like this, not a triangle, but a square. 

412
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,120
Well. 

413
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,980
Really? Where are you sitting 

414
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Kadikoy. 

415
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,280
Isn't it difficult for the woman?

416
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,180
I don't ... 

417
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,720
... handle it. 

418
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,279
Yes, everything is ready. Let's go to the table. 

419
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,080
So how do you know Barlas? 

420
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,660
Are you okay? 

421
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,340
Yes. 

422
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,540
I couldn't understand, who is Barlas? 

423
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,120
My husband. 

424
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,900
I think we met him but couldn't remember him. 

425
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,940
I did not understand well, I suppose you think you will find me immediately. 

426
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,020
Then I would like the teas. 

427
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,340
Can we have some Filiz Hanımcığım tea? 

428
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,700
Sitareci, my dear, Aydancığım, Bahar sit down and you. 

429
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,040
Look over there, you're crazy. 

430
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,859
You became an astronaut. 

431
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,560
Come on. 

432
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:34,760
No, I was going to make an announcement at some point not to burn it with fire. 

433
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,960
The exaggeration is not so much. 

434
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,580
Caramba.

435
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,520
No, I saw this girl somewhere, but where I saw her. 

436
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,440
Who found this? 

437
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,640
Let me know, brother, surprise. 

438
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,880
What's going on? 

439
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,440
... okay brother ... 

440
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,899
... left, it's over. 

441
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,940
He went away. 

442
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,800
You know, Sitareci? Onur, introduced us to Bahar. 

443
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,080
You meet Onur, am I right? 

444
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,240
Is that so? 

445
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,680
We are going to the same gym with Onur. Actually, when he met Derin from school, he noticed. 

446
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,920
School finished yet? 

447
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,060
Unfortunately. 

448
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,100
Since he had to earn money, he had to take a break from time to time. 

449
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,860
It is very difficult, both school and work are difficult. 

450
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,380
Mommy. 

451
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,160
My angel. 

452
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,200
My dear woke up, do you come and come to see?

453
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,240
You want to paint? 

454
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,180
Okay, let's find something else, sit down a bit. 

455
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,240
Do you want to eat these? 

456
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,940
Well ... 

457
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,640
... are you working at the nightclub, honey? 

458
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,020
In other words, I don't realize that I also do a lot of bar shows. 

459
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,060
It must be difficult to work at night. 

460
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,580
But I got used to it. 

461
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,279
Should I play in my room? 

462
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,480
I think it's a great idea. 

463
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,520
Look, I had nothing. 

464
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,720
It seems that way. 

465
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,580
What happened? 

466
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,460
You seem sad ... 

467
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,600
We will go to another doctor. 

468
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,240
We need to cook fast. 

469
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,680
Bahar ... 

470
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,700
... come on, you're not playing games. 

471
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,060
Oh I'm very sorry. 

472
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,600
So ... 

473
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,600
... let this mother be a baby ...

474
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,340
... this is daddy baby. 

475
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,640
No, this mother, this father. 

476
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,720
This is Ececik and this is his older sister. 

477
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,100
So what is Bahar? 

478
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,440
Let this be Bahar. 

479
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,980
It is so beautiful this Bahar baby. 

480
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,160
So ... 

481
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:20,380
... baby father and baby mother sleep there. 

482
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,560
No way. 

483
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:22,640
Why? 

484
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:33,560
Because Ece is sick, Murat, you do not understand that this boy is responsible for everything because of you, you are going to sleep alone. With the mother, Ece baby will lie down. 

485
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,320
Bahar. 

486
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,560
Yes Dear. 

487
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,960
Should they cook? 

488
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,020
Let them do it. 

489
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,859
Look. 

490
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,360
I opened it. 

491
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,480
Hello my daughter, good night. 

492
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,160
Hi Dad, Bahar you remember my friend from school, right? 

493
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,380
I remember, of course, hello.

494
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,040
Welcome dad. 

495
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,740
Princess. 

496
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,640
Darling, what's up, darling? 

497
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,879
How are you? 

498
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,180
Dad, how are you, how are you so formal? 

499
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,640
How are you? 

500
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:56,960
I'm fine you? 

501
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,360
Thanks. 

502
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,780
Okay, I'll change my clothes, okay? 

503
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,100
Welcome Dear. 

504
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,660
Hello dear, hello. 

505
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,880
Let me shower and come. 

506
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,360
Okay, but we have guests, get it quickly. 

507
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,260
Quick, I'm coming. 

508
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,260
Okay, why are you sweating so much? 

509
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,320
I wonder if I am sick. 

510
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,660
Come on, it's not hot either. 

511
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,240
Come on, I don't understand. 

512
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:27,020
His ring, I'll say something, came. 

513
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:30,360
Well. 

514
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,360
Go. 

515
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,300
Is the table okay girls? 

516
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,560
Okay, mom is ready. 

517
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,779
Come on, let's see.

518
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:49,900
Mom ... 

519
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,840
... you're so beautiful again. 

520
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,120
One drink before eating so many liars? 

521
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,300
It would be very good. 

522
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,500
I saw your friend today ... 

523
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,580
... he said hello. 

524
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,900
Which one of my friend? 

525
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:23,580
Bahar. 

526
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,020
Is that so? 

527
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,379
Where did you meet? 

528
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,640
She brought Yasemin's dress back. 

529
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,520
She is a pretty girl. 

530
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,420
This. 

531
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,800
What did he say? 

532
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,340
We have never talked about air to water. 

533
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Why is that? 

534
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,520
Is there something I should know, honey? 

535
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,420
I understand now. 

536
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,520
It's not a problem like you guessed, mom. 

537
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,740
What does it mean? 

538
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:02,560
I'm hungry like a wolf. 

539
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,160
Go. 

540
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,680
Come honey 

541
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,880
Welcome back.

542
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:31,180
So I don't think I'm putting too much pressure on you. Bahar, after all, Ece also has a school. 

543
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,220
It's actually a great idea. 

544
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,520
What is a great idea? 

545
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,900
I hired Bahar. 

546
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,379
Like Ece's gaming sister. 

547
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,400
Well, Yasemin ... 

548
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,120
There is no objection. 

549
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,880
Hurrah! 

550
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,600
Thank you Mrs. Yasemin. 

551
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,120
No problem. 

552
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,240
Oh, I was just forgetting, dad ... 

553
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,940
... look Bahar is very polite who bought you a present? 

554
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,120
Thanks. 

555
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,860
Thanks. 

556
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,440
Blue. 

557
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,780
Is there a problem? 

558
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,600
No, no ... 

559
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,419
... no problem, how do you know, of course Murat doesn't like blue very much ... 

560
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,620
... not much of its color, no Murat ... 

561
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,259
... it doesn't suit ...

562
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,819
... but you are very elegant, thank you very much. 

563
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,240
Is that so? 

564
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,100
Fits my daughter. 

565
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:46,560
But since this is your gift, I will give it to you because it suits you better. 

566
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,560
My dear. 

567
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,020
How is your school going? 

568
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,600
Good mommy, as always. 

569
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,060
I'll say something ... 

570
00:50:54,540 --> 00:51:00,759
... I love your composition, so I think it's a very different and very powerful composition. 

571
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,640
It is not like this? 

572
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,020
Composite ... 

573
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,480
... isn't it good? 

574
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,480
Yes. Yes. 

575
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,339
I think the idea of ​​stopping at a time is very creative. 

576
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,500
A tremendous idea was drawn in that section at a very different time. 

577
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,900
It is not like this? 

578
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,300
How was everyone scared, but suddenly there was something wrong? 

579
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,860
You are a genius, Derinci. 

580
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,180
Thanks.

581
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:39,200
Actually, I said not to blow up, but you found such a good idea, Derin. 

582
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:45,359
Meanwhile, words are breaking, congratulations Murat Bey. 

583
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,020
Thanks. 

584
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,140
Anyway, I said let's sing ... 

585
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,460
... come and say love ... 

586
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,760
I'll come if he says come. 

587
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,880
... I will run for your love. 

588
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,060
Where do you know this girl? 

589
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,360
I do not know it very well. 

590
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,600
Why did you ask? 

591
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,700
His voice was good. 

592
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,960
The food is great ... 

593
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,840
Let's tell Leman Hanım to do it frequently. 

594
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,860
Did you like it too? 

595
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,360
Well ... 

596
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,620
Give me the salad. 

597
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,540
Did you know that Brother Ruhi said I know her? 

598
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,020
Father. 

599
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,020
Yes son. 

600
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,640
Brother Ruhi said I know her.

601
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:56,259
What should I know, boy? I don't care about Bahar, but it's in your head. 

602
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,540
Can I have some meat? 

603
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,220
Thank you. 

604
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,300
Why are you angry? 

605
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,040
... we are talking here. 

606
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,240
Well. 

607
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,720
Let's talk. 

608
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,380
What are we going to talk about? 

609
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,080
We are chatting, why are you nervous now? 

610
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,660
Why do you also know Bahar? 

611
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,640
I don't know, where will I know about Bahar? 

612
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,779
Enough ... 

613
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,520
... close this matter. 

614
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,620
Let's have a comfortable meal. 

615
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,480
Let me kiss your mouth. 

616
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,279
Come on, kiss me. 

617
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,440
Barlas. 

618
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,380
Yasemin ... 

619
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,380
... about last night ... 

620
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,500
... I want to talk. 

621
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,280
Let's talk ... 

622
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,520
... let's talk about our responsibilities? 

623
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,600
OR...

624
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:11,279
... we can't do it according to our heads, for example. 

625
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,140
Here you have. 

626
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,800
Murat, we have two children at home. 

627
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,319
... we must be aware of this ... 

628
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,020
... yes boring yes difficult ... 

629
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,780
... but unfortunately being a father is something like this. 

630
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,080
I know that. 

631
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,120
Is that so? 

632
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:34,060
So why don't you think it does that to me? 

633
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,840
Because ... 

634
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,520
... you ... 

635
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:40,700
... have a bad mood to look at everything from your own perspective because ... 

636
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,460
You Everything ... 

637
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,800
... you look through your own eyes and interpret. 

638
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,700
Murat, you attacked me last night. 

639
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,380
I said no, but you didn't even listen to me ... 

640
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:54,759
... how do you think I can interpret this? 

641
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,220
We need to act a bit mentally now. 

642
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,080
Well?

643
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,839
I want the children to understand nothing. Derin is already very shocked. 

644
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,020
I don't want them to be sadder. 

645
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,500
Tonight ... 

646
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,680
... how it's supposed to be ... 

647
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,000
... we're going to sleep together in our room. 

648
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,660
This issue is now closed here. 

649
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:36,100
In the meantime, I don't want you to interpret this offer in any other way, so you shouldn't think of anything else. 

650
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,140
I only got you ... 

651
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,560
... I didn't forgive him. 

652
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,860
Understood. 

653
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,860
You speak, I will go out. 

654
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,400
No, no, it's not necessary, honey. 

655
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,920
I will not speak now. 

656
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:32,740
Of course, you wondered when you left the party early and even asked me if you saw it.

657
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:39,960
I don't know if we didn't talk or when I had to leave so early, I'll probably ask you what you did, like you said, you wonder. 

658
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,940
You were right, my mother will never give up on my father. 

659
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,140
From the orchestra. 

660
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,799
I'm late like this, but is there no problem? 

661
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:07,600
No, honey, no, ours are comfortable, and now you are counted as family. 

662
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,180
You are Ece's older sister. 

663
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:15,040
I am aware of what they offer me forever. 

664
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,520
You are very lucky. Very good people. 

665
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,780
They are not bad. 

666
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,520
I guess they get along so well? 

667
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,480
They adapt well. 

668
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:32,640
It seems to me an ideal couple. 

669
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,020
Yeah yeah, they get along really well ... 

670
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:11,480
... they're even like a team that always complement each other, they're still so in love that they can never give up.

671
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,900
Thank you very much for everything. 

672
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,020
You're going? 

673
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:51,140
Let me get up now. 

674
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,060
Let's call a cab right now. 

675
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:55,640
My mother called, but they said there was no taxi. 

676
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,700
Don't bother, I'll run away. 

677
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:02,760
No, this is not the case at this time. Murat, will you leave her? 

678
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,580
Do not bother yourself. 

679
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,980
No dear, what a hassle. 

680
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,980
How is this bad Turkish movie? 

681
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,340
What did my friend do? 

682
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:39,420
What? 

683
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,140
I tell you? 

684
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:49,500
... you are the one who lied to me, you say you get out of the car and you are my head, and now you also offend me as if I did something. 

685
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,740
What do I say I did? 

686
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:57,000
No, I mean, I'm not going to explode, I'm not going to fail, but you are irritating. 

687
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:06,420
What are you doing? 

688
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,540
This is bad. 

689
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:09,820
What? 

690
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,960
What wrong, what happens?

691
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:17,680
What's wrong with this, or I don't see anything wrong with that, Murat ... 

692
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:25,040
... so we both feel good about each other, we have a good time, we have fun together, which could be wrong with that ... 

693
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:29,640
... who says I don't understand either, or what could be wrong to be happy. 

694
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,640
We are both grown up and free. 

695
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,160
It happens ... 

696
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,260
... it's debatable how free you are, of course I forgot. 

697
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,780
What does that mean now? 

698
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,320
Even your wife decides what color you like. 

699
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,780
Who are you? 

700
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,960
Is he the person that Yasemin wants you to be ... 

701
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,400
... otherwise I know, I know, love ... 

702
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:02,360
... but it's obvious that Murat, whom Yasemin never met, or rather, he doesn't even want to know ? 

703
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:05,820
Anyway ...

704
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,160
... why am I talking about that? 

705
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,440
Don't be afraid not to bother you ... 

706
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,940
... I'm not going to tell your wife what happened ... 

707
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,259
... well, there's nothing to tell. 

708
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:21,700
I'll call you tomorrow and tell you that I don't take the job ... 

709
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,460
... this problem goes away. 

710
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:27,980
But I must tell you something ... 

711
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:31,880
... if you want to think about what I said ... 

712
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,660
... I don't know how long you can go on like this. 

713
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,400
Good night. 

714
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:59,540
Idiot, I'm still thinking ... 

715
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,160
I can't. 

716
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,280
What can't I do? 

717
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,840
You're right ... 

718
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:06,980
... I can't do this. 

719
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,500
I can't be that Murat anyway. 

720
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,820
I don't want to upset anyone ... 

721
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:16,820
... anyone ... 

722
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,220
What am I going to do? 

723
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,040
Don't worry then.

724
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,280
I do not bother. 

725
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,440
Come on. 

726
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,040
Welcome our boy. 

727
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,040
Thanks. 

728
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,420
Welcome. 

729
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:23,400
Wait, what are you doing, what are you doing? 

730
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,040
Don't worry ... 

731
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,400
... this fortune in me, this wish is a great income, he puts his mouth on the hook. 

732
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:36,319
Although he doesn't want to be caught, no son of Adam can take him and put him in this bucket. 

733
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:38,460
But ... 

734
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:39,620
... love is here. 

735
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:46,500
Even a bucket of water can make it look like water. 

736
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,280
Can I sit? 

737
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:49,480
Of course, it is late. 

738
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,860
Should I tell you something, boy? 

739
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:57,420
Here you are. 

740
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,700
You will leave it all to yourself ... 

741
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,200
... current. 

742
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,080
Does it happen when I say I quit? 

743
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:09,340
Even if you don't let go, our boy cuts off love.

744
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,880
You are trapped, now ... 

745
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:15,860
... a curtain is pulled over your eye ... 

746
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,720
... everything I say is empty ... 

747
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:22,819
... wherever your heart takes you, there is no other solution. 

748
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:26,860
What are you looking for? 

749
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,420
... our boy is in vain, I tell you ... 

750
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,080
... when I see myself like this, I'm reading one by one ... 

751
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:35,980
Yes, tell me to relax. 

752
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,780
I'm confused ... 

753
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,700
... am I in love or am I happy? 

754
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:46,759
... What do I want ... 

755
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:50,660
... I don't know ... 

756
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,240
... mixed. 

757
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:59,600
You will fly, our boy will fly, you will risk falling before flying. 

758
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,960
If he won't be able to move ... 

759
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:08,380
... why did he put this wing on my heart? 

760
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:12,380
... I remember correct why to fly, where to put it ...

761
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,320
... takes off and turns around to find me saved and find me in a bucket. 

762
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,260
I am in such a place ... 

763
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,280
... what is possible to go ... 

764
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,359
what is possible to stay ... 

765
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,500
... I am somewhere ... 

766
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:34,100
... between surrendering and resisting ... 

767
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,960
... I am in the middle of the earth with ... 

768
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,580
... on the eve of losing ... 

769
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:44,419
... I am on the brink of a new life ... 

770
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,060
... it will hurt if I stay ... 

771
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,560
... I go .. . 

772
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,300
... my life. 

773
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,480
I know you don't sleep, Yasemin. 

774
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:25,980
Don't worry, I won't touch you. 

775
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:55,180
Good night. 

776
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,259
If there is a happy night, be yours. 

777
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:41,000
Your suit is ready. 

778
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,300
Breakfast is also ready in ten minutes. 

779
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Good Morning. 

780
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,560
Come on, Murat, what are you doing?

781
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:01,860
You are like a child. 

782
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:17,840
No, I can't say I was wrong ... 

783
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:24,179
You have to see, I'm trying to rotate, I can't rotate. The man is looking at me like this, if I see my soul, my soul left my body. 

784
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:37,980
What happened? 

785
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:49,140
This bothers me, Bahar. 

786
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,160
About what? 

787
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,420
So ... 

788
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,860
... this thing between us ... 

789
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,120
... let's say friendship. 

790
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:05,259
Will we come back to the head again? 

791
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,800
You know what I think sometimes ... 

792
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,580
... you're the one who doesn't want to be happy. 

793
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:14,140
What does this mean, where do you get it from now? 

794
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:19,860
You never leave yourself in the moment, you don't know how to be happy with Murat, you don't know how to be happy. 

795
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:22,700
I don't know ... 

796
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,320
... maybe you don't know you're right.

797
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:36,620
By looking at these latest tests and evaluating the opinions of my other colleagues, I can say that ... 

798
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,700
... the cause of your discomfort is not physical. 

799
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,260
We believe this is for psychosomatic reasons. 

800
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:45,860
Then? 

801
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:52,540
Therefore, I recommend that you meet with a psychiatrist, even if you want to have Ayşegül Hanım in our hospital, you can contact her immediately. 

802
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:54,660
... the room is already aware of this situation. 

803
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,080
But look how on this side ... 

804
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:04,980
as if it had made a difference. 

805
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,980
I said it, I said it ... 

806
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,256
... said it will be the same for a few days, is there a difference? 

807
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,720
So there is a little difference. 

808
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:14,160
Didn't you just make Sitare?

809
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:20,519
Look, this is between these eyebrows, look here, so there are no wrinkles when you frown. 

810
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:21,960
HE. 

811
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:32,880
I understand that you don't need sugar, you don't care, your husband admires you, but don't be so indifferent to us mortals. 

812
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:39,179
Speaking of mortal, there was a young woman working with you. What was Bade's name? 

813
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:43,280
Bahar isn't happening that morning, but she's going to school ... 

814
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:47,020
... she's not working the toilet anyway, playing with Ece. 

815
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:48,720
He imagined he was playing the game. 

816
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,460
Yasemin ... 

817
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:51,840
... young girl ... 

818
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,840
... don't you hesitate? 

819
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,840
Murat? 

820
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:02,040
... nonsense, Derin friend, these are things that are not Murat's style. 

821
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:05,300
I swear whatever it is that I should lie. 

822
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:12,019
Don't you think so?

823
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:16,240
If my sweet, Yasemin does not bother, I think there is no problem. 

824
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,760
The woman is confident, my dear. 

825
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:24,840
But they are right, they are very sweet. 

826
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:35,620
I don't know, sugar, I only know one thing. One day if your husband gives you flowers, there is something behind it. 

827
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:47,160
I'm out of work, I'm out ... 

828
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:51,640
... I'll come to you in a few hours and let you know if the caller is asking. 

829
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:53,680
Thanks. 

830
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,760
Which one are you looking at? 

831
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:01,260
These earrings ... 

832
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:02,900
Aren't they so beautiful? 

833
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,759
I think, is it a seahorse? 

834
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,900
Yes, yes, I looked like that. 

835
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,360
We are going to buy, do you want them? 

836
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:11,500
How it is not necessary is expensive. 

837
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:15,500
Couldn't you be the one who told me to live in the moment? 

838
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,280
Please I am asking you. 

839
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:22,860
Hello everybody.

840
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:24,560
Hello and welcome. 

841
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:27,416
There is a seahorse in the window, can we get the earrings? 

842
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:28,820
I'm sorry Mr. 

843
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:32,720
... the earring was sold out, more precisely, one of our clients set it aside for his wife. 

844
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,679
Do you want anything else? 

845
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,260
Will you stop Bahar, please? 

846
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,140
What happened? Why are you doing this? 

847
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,460
I am not your lover, nor am I closing. 

848
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:57,500
Never again, don't leave me like this. 

849
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:02,240
I can't understand, so I said something wrong, I said, let's buy another, what's up? 

850
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:06,360
The gift is something taken from the heart, Murat, you could think of me and buy it in the trash ... 

851
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:11,559
... I liked those earrings, but I would not like a gold bracelet. 

852
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,480
I'm fine, I'm not taking the medicine.

853
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:26,140
Yes, but you're stressed, you heard what the psychiatrist said. 

854
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:31,900
What happened now, whoever said to see another doctor, were you immediately convinced by what this woman said? 

855
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:33,600
Okay, they couldn't find anything. 

856
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,240
Well then I have nothing and I'm fine. 

857
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:48,440
I'm just trying to help you. 

858
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,300
Let me tell you, what you did is not helping me. 

859
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:57,519
Don't behave like a child. 

860
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,880
Like a child? 

861
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:01,340
What do you think you are? 

862
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:03,900
I'm just trying to help you. 

863
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:07,500
No Onur, you won't help me, okay? 

864
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:12,940
Where are you going? 

865
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:14,260
What do you care 

866
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,560
Still not here? This Murat Effendi. 

867
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:41,220
You've done a rush job, we'll hold the meeting and I'll pass the information on to you, Dad.

868
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:44,880
What do you know about it, what information will you pass on? 

869
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:48,639
Speak before, let Onur come. 

870
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:50,480
I'm talking, I'm already saying dad. 

871
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:55,460
I know very well what he did and what he wanted to do. 

872
01:18:56,340 --> 01:19:03,500
Look at me, Barlas, I don't want to break your heart, but if I get involved, you hurt yourself. 

873
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,500
Competition with your child. 

874
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,320
You lose. 

875
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:29,900
Very good, Mr. Sadri. 

876
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:47,140
What? 

877
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:47,940
Where are you? 

878
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:49,280
What do you care 

879
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:55,340
If my son responded as a man, there is something to consult, I would say that if you are looking for it, come soon. 

880
01:19:55,660 --> 01:20:00,000
I wasn't around you, weren't you saying to get involved in company business? 

881
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:05,540
Your configuration breaks again, you are surprised, come back, let's talk, we come, you come.

882
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:08,200
I will come, we will talk, we will solve everything. 

883
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,700
Then you will see what the settings are. 

884
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:28,280
I apologize, are you still going to pout? 

885
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:33,300
I'm not a money fool to be affected when he says he likes me when he puts me in the jewelry box. 

886
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:35,200
You understand me? 

887
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:38,440
The whole neighborhood understood. 

888
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:39,440
What does that mean? 

889
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:44,099
So you said so loud that everyone understood. 

890
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:46,880
I get mad about those things. 

891
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,280
You are right, I sincerely tell you that you are right. 

892
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:54,240
I mean, after that I'll buy you junk as a gift. 

893
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:00,520
You have one. 

894
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,080
I swear I didn't know what you said. 

895
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:07,600
Come on, I'm gone. 

896
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,280
Well. 

897
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,280
I am sorry. 

898
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:10,420
Not important. 

899
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,000
What are you trying to do?

900
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:04,080
I know what to say honey, but if you want to come tell me, don't stay there. 

901
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:11,120
Sorry, I'll pack a little house, but if you want a lot, I can make you a coffee. 

902
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,460
What are you trying to do? 

903
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:20,320
Make it enough, no intimidation, we love each other with murat. 

904
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,660
Bahar come to you, the man is married. 

905
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:24,700
Well ... 

906
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,020
... what if he's married? 

907
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:27,100
What happened? 

908
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:30,680
... I think your ears can't hear, I say the man is married. 

909
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:31,680
No ... 

910
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,140
... hears great ... 

911
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,600
... but I can't see a problem with that ... 

912
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,960
... let me give you an example if you understand better ... 

913
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,920
... for example, your dad. 

914
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:47,980
Because of someone like you, I was breaking up a bit more with my father and you are the only kind of opportunist who looks like your mother.

915
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,120
Is that so? 

916
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:58,580
Then you will be happy with your mother and father in life, now, get out of my house, get out of my house, don't interfere with my work or my life. 

917
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:00,480
Also ... 

918
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:07,440
... we both know that you don't think of me as darling, you just try to punish him because your father didn't give you the right ... 

919
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:11,480
... don't eat me, but if you want more air, come out now. 

920
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:23,880
I'm coming partner. 

921
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:27,980
Calm down, I took care that the meeting is over now. 

922
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:29,980
Don't joke, I'm ten minutes late. 

923
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:33,860
No, what about this girl? 

924
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:35,020
What a Girl? 

925
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,120
Or Murat Düdenli ... 

926
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:41,740
... you are not the man who will forget the meeting time. 

927
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:48,040
The meeting, which ended an hour ago, is for a reason, you are generally in love. 

928
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,660
Do not be silly.

929
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:52,940
Look, don't eat me, don't eat me for the love of God, Ruhi muhi is cheating on you. 

930
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:57,139
I'm the master of this business, don't eat me from the master league. 

931
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:00,040
There is no such thing Barlas. 

932
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:02,880
Hay, I understand you ... 

933
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:07,520
... your lord is trapped in your life now you can't feed yourself but don't eat me. 

934
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,080
There's no such thing. 

935
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:14,820
Look ... 

936
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:20,800
... you don't care about me, you can do whatever you want, even if you ask me, keep doing the same. 

937
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:27,880
Because I haven't seen you so energetic and full of life for a long time. 

938
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,240
Here you are. 

939
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,120
Thanks. 

940
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:50,860
No, he treats me like a child, I'm at an age where I can take my own responsibility ... 

941
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:56,400
... but sometimes he behaves so much that even my own anger feels like a whim after a while.

942
01:24:57,180 --> 01:25:04,400
He changes the subject in such a way that he jumps, so that someone will fight you, then you yell at him, so why are you angry? 

943
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:08,320
... I was so mad at you, who am I mad at? 

944
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:10,220
Moron. 

945
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,900
You like this Onur, I get it. 

946
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:19,880
Is it too obvious? 

947
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:21,820
Then. 

948
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:31,240
Did you understand that you did not understand or did not understand? 

949
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:32,240
Honey ... 

950
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:37,140
... men don't understand anything you don't say, sometimes even when they say it. 

951
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:39,960
So I think you talk to Onur. 

952
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:41,740
No. 

953
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:48,380
Don't be silly Bahar, I can't talk about it, so my hand goes around my feet. 

954
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,480
Even now I am glowing red. 

955
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:57,800
It wouldn't be bad if we had a few glasses or something and you would be relieved. 

956
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,020
I mean ... 

957
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:04,019
... I don't have much to drink ...

958
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,820
... I'm not so used to it. 

959
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:10,059
Honey, there's nothing to get used to, we'll drink two glasses of something at the bottom. 

960
01:26:22,179 --> 01:26:30,139
I don't know sugar. If your husband brings flowers, there is something behind. 

961
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:35,340
Where are the garden shears? 

962
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,600
These draw the car, I'm pruning. 

963
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:42,540
Wait, I put them on this thing. 

964
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:03,240
Bahar give me one too. 

965
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,500
It fell out of his pocket. 

966
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:23,660
You like me? 

967
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:25,280
I liked. 

968
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:28,940
So it's not my style, but ... 

969
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:31,340
... gift is a gift ... 

970
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,019
I don't know, maybe I'll change. 

971
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:36,900
Thank you. 

972
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:46,940
Murat, I know you want to make amends ... 

973
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:51,500
... I am also aware that you are trying to change something ... 

974
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:54,700
... this is a great start, but ... 

975
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,799
... don't expect high expectations because ... .

976
01:28:58,360 --> 01:28:59,700
... some injuries ... 

977
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:02,080
... it's taking too long to repair. 

978
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:03,320
Yasemin ... 

979
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,440
... I have to tell you ... 

980
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:06,700
Father. 

981
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:08,020
My dear. 

982
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:09,140
My daughter. 

983
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:11,340
The babies were awake. 

984
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:13,960
When he woke up, okay, let's go right now. 

985
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:17,940
The food will be ready for half an hour, according to him, an early completion game. 

986
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:19,940
But we had just started. 

987
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:22,480
But you will continue after lunch, come on. 

988
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:34,100
Hello Mrs. Yasemin, hello, we are with Derin and I called him to inform him. 

989
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:39,620
She drank a little, I don't want to send her home like this. 

990
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,880
Just tell me this ... I 

991
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:45,380
should worry ... 

992
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:49,540
No, don't worry, don't worry, everything is under control.

993
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:54,680
I'll sober her up and put him in a cab, don't worry, okay? 

994
01:29:54,680 --> 01:30:03,540
No, no, no, no, his father can't see him, it bothers me that he makes up a lie. Don't send Murat to you before he's sober. 

995
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:08,380
Ok, ok, don't worry, then good night. 

996
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:11,640
Are you okay? 

997
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,460
Come on, get up and let's go home. 

998
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:21,719
Who were you talking to? 

999
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:22,720
With Derin ... 

1000
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:31,260
... I was talking to Derin, they were trying to rehearse, they were trying to tell him that he was going to be late. 

1001
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:33,460
Are we not exaggerating this test topic a bit? 

1002
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:35,140
Why should I exaggerate my dear? 

1003
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:40,179
My Ece, lamb, come on, we wash your hands right before, mom. 

1004
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:41,640
But it is not dirty. 

1005
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:44,720
But look, I don't want to appeal. Go. 

1006
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,040
Come on girl come on baby come quick 

1007
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:48,400
Without running.

1008
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:51,840
Do you think it's okay to stress so much? 

1009
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:53,599
So I don't like to get tired like that. 

1010
01:30:53,880 --> 01:31:00,720
But if Murat depends on you, there is no difficulty. 

1011
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:02,340
I did not mean that. 

1012
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,360
I'm afraid she will be ill. 

1013
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:12,960
You are exaggerating, but why is she sick, is she not the first pianist? 

1014
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:24,140
Also, when it comes to this stress problem, I don't think it's that bad, so a little stress is quite motivating on the exam. 

1015
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:55,020
You were going to the company, what happened to report my limit? 

1016
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:56,640
I do not want to talk. 

1017
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:59,740
Wait a minute, wait a minute under your tongue. 

1018
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,240
Is there a girl thing? 

1019
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:14,240
Talk to me son, whatever you're going to talk about, don't trust that, is it convenient for your father? 

1020
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:16,880
Ok let me tell you then ...

1021
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:19,220
I want my right in the company. 

1022
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:20,820
What does that mean? 

1023
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:22,820
I want to get into my job. 

1024
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:23,840
You say my job. 

1025
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,740
Exactly, won't they leave it to me in the end? 

1026
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:29,920
What are you talking about here father and son? 

1027
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:32,400
No mother ... 

1028
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:39,420
... my father wanted me to work in the company, he was telling her, he insisted, he insisted that he couldn't break it, right? 

1029
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:41,880
Well that's good news. 

1030
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:46,920
He will ask when and when your grandfather will be very happy. 

1031
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:48,700
Okay you know. 

1032
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:53,080
Don't leave one day tomorrow. 

1033
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:54,960
Don't worry, father. 

1034
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:05,140
I've run out of milk. 

1035
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:06,820
Well done. 

1036
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,080
Good Morning. 

1037
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:14,100
Where is Derin? 

1038
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:16,100
He left early. 

1039
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:19,440
Yasemin, I think this question of exams.

1040
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,879
Let's not talk about it Murat right now. 

1041
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:23,320
Come on mom. 

1042
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:27,420
Stop, let me see. 

1043
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:30,800
Sick? 

1044
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:32,580
He started school. 

1045
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:33,980
What does that mean? 

1046
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,080
So there is a pandemic. 

1047
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,180
I'm fine mom. 

1048
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:41,720
Get up girl get up 

1049
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:44,080
Where? 

1050
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:47,759
I'll take you to school today. 

1051
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:48,860
Hurrah! 

1052
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:51,760
Come on, grab your bag, run, run, run. 

1053
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:52,980
Hurrah! 

1054
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:56,980
What are you doing Murat? 

1055
01:33:58,820 --> 01:34:01,679
As a precaution, I only measured. 

1056
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:05,260
Yasemin ... 

1057
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,500
... I think you should see a doctor. 

1058
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:10,920
So as a precaution. 

1059
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:25,460
My daughter. 

1060
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:31,540
Bahar. 

1061
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:35,280
Bahar. 

1062
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:44,240
Derin. 

1063
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:45,240
Good Morning. 

1064
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:46,300
Good Morning. 

1065
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:48,300
Are you okay?

1066
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:53,260
My head hurts so much, look, oh, I can't do it like this. 

1067
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:57,120
But I'll tell you something, I feel great. 

1068
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:05,720
Don't worry my dear, it was the same when I was your age, and then I'll give it to you and you'll come yourself. 

1069
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:10,820
Meanwhile, my mother called five hundred times and informed the police what should I do? 

1070
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:14,500
I informed him last night, by the way. 

1071
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:18,520
Really. 

1072
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:29,920
I'll see, my mother has come, I tell you, nothing will escape from you. 

1073
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:41,320
Who is it? 

1074
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:47,420
Dad, why did you come? 

1075
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:52,059
I called Derin, to find out. 

1076
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,720
What a good father you are, Murat Bey. 

1077
01:36:55,620 --> 01:36:57,780
Yes, Bahar called. 

1078
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:00,820
Why is that? 

1079
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:11,260
When I couldn't reach Yasemin, I had to call Derinci, your father last night.

1080
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:17,040
Murat Bey, I hope you didn't tell Yasemin Hanım that you know that Derin is here. 

1081
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:19,340
Say no ... 

1082
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:20,640
... I don't say. 

1083
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:22,060
Anyway ... 

1084
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:26,080
... this is our little secret. 

1085
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:47,219
Derin. 

1086
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,360
Good morning mom. 

1087
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:52,059
My God, where are you, my daughter? 

1088
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:55,000
I'm going to school, I'm fine, don't worry. 

1089
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,880
I told your father that he left early in the morning, okay? 

1090
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:01,000
Fine, thanks. 

1091
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:02,900
I will see. 

1092
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:11,480
What happened, my daughter told me that you are lying? 

1093
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:17,520
Isn't it a very bad thing to lie? 

1094
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:38,120
This is Murat's gift, papa. Always very polite the day we had a little disagreement ... 

1095
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:44,920
I think he was broken and seemed upset the next day he came in with this gift. 

1096
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:50,280
He is trying to fix us.

1097
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:55,360
Sometimes we break up involuntarily ... 

1098
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:57,500
sometimes we don't get along ... 

1099
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,680
but trying to carry on ... 

1100
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:05,160
... if I step into myself ... 

1101
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:08,000
... what do you say? 

1102
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:10,620
For example, if I give a gift ... 

1103
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:13,920
... a shirt, a tie. 

1104
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:16,700
Yasemin. 

1105
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Yes Dad. 

1106
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:21,580
Who is your husband? 

1107
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:25,160
Murat dad, don't you remember? 

1108
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:28,040
We need to talk. 

1109
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:36,240
I have you. 

1110
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,500
I have you. 

1111
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:43,300
I'm kidding. 

1112
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:44,460
What does that mean, brother? 

1113
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:48,360
Either I'm kidding or how long haven't you been in the office. 

1114
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:51,140
Look at me, are you okay? 

1115
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,280
I'm fine, fine. 

1116
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:57,200
I am not Ruhi. 

1117
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:58,820
What happens? What happened? 

1118
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:01,280
I have to tell someone. 

1119
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:04,880
Are you ready? 

1120
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,160
Yes tell me.

1121
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:09,280
There is a girl. 

1122
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,100
When did you get married? 

1123
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:19,160
Twenty years ago, you were, my mother was there. 

1124
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:25,900
Twenty years ... 

1125
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:28,000
... already has it. 

1126
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:31,820
Twenty years later ... 

1127
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,860
... people don't have much to share. 

1128
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:39,860
When I say a child ... 

1129
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:43,500
... there is no time to be alone. 

1130
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:48,580
How ... 

1131
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:50,540
... are you happy? 

1132
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:53,300
So ... 

1133
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:58,400
... maybe. 

1134
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:00,760
... Yes ... 

1135
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:04,580
... as you say ... 

1136
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:07,260
... after a while ... 

1137
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:10,180
... you're married. 

1138
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:15,140
Then. 

1139
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:17,280
Are you married, is there more? 

1140
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:22,860
But I knew I told you that I saw this girl somewhere. 

1141
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:26,940
Where did you see where you see for the love of God or is the world little brother? 

1142
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:28,960
Does Barlas know? 

1143
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,680
No, I just told you.

1144
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:37,839
Brother, you know something like putting a bomb under your marriage, so you need to stop talking to this girl. 

1145
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:40,860
I'm happy Ruhi, what will happen now? 

1146
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:50,240
Not happy, you have to be married, brother, do you care, or will you make it clean like Barlas? 

1147
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:53,580
Then you will never be involved in such things. 

1148
01:41:53,940 --> 01:41:59,379
What is the cleanliness of this job or how does Barlas clean this job? What are you saying? 

1149
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:01,980
Either look here or not, I don't care ... 

1150
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:05,160
... and you took the girl home. 

1151
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:10,880
My son, you will get in trouble, the girl is already playing with you. 

1152
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:14,299
I didn't know that I was going there in the morning or that no one had sin. 

1153
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:15,600
I'd go there in the morning ... 

1154
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:22,740
... purity, this is yours, purity, girl, it has made you an idiot, it has made you a fool.

1155
01:42:22,740 --> 01:42:27,219
Thank you or you have been a great help, what happened to what you said? 

1156
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:33,000
What happened, Ruhi? Listen to the sound of your heart, wherever your emotions take you. 

1157
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:38,500
Believe me, this is not the happiness you are feeling right now, that girl is not a solid shoe. 

1158
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:45,860
Look, Murat, if you lose Yasemin, you will be very unhappy, so don't tell me. 

1159
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,200
As a joke. 

1160
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:09,799
I am sorry. 

1161
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:16,860
So at least we agree on this. 

1162
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:21,880
Sorry, I shouldn't have insisted. 

1163
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:27,160
So this is a decision you made, it should have given you time. 

1164
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:32,200
I thought you were right, I'll take the drugs. 

1165
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:37,820
I was a little nervous when I said home school stress or something. 

1166
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:39,559
What happened at home? 

1167
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:47,980
What about my mom and dad?

1168
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:50,660
... they fight all the time ... 

1169
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:57,480
... so they try not to be sure, but there is one thing, there is something like electric current in the house. 

1170
01:43:58,340 --> 01:43:59,340
Why is that? 

1171
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:00,600
I do not know. 

1172
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:02,820
Another ... 

1173
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:07,259
Could there be another woman? 

1174
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:10,380
No, what more woman. 

1175
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:17,300
Therefore, they don't seem to get along with each other as if they have a problem. 

1176
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:24,000
Why did you ask it like that? 

1177
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:29,220
Why are you asking another woman? 

1178
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,599
Usually I don't know if I said it. 

1179
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:38,860
But of course it was illogical to think about yours, you're right. 

1180
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:41,880
Anyway, let's take these drugs. 

1181
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:56,460
No matter what we talk about, I don't have much time anymore, I'm working. 

1182
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:03,600
Are you playing with me, Bahar? 

1183
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:05,180
What game? 

1184
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:08,620
What was Derin doing in your house?

1185
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,360
What is this? 

1186
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:17,700
The girl had problems, she asked me that my mind was a bit wrong, I didn't want to leave it that simple. 

1187
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:21,720
It's great to fool yourself all around. 

1188
01:45:22,060 --> 01:45:27,900
Unfortunately, Muratcığım has nothing to do with you, sorry, but the world does not revolve around you. 

1189
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,420
What happened to him? 

1190
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
What do you care 

1191
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:38,640
If you are very curious, you may wonder if you want to learn. 

1192
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,920
I guess I'm not going to stand here and throw you off Derin. 

1193
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:45,300
Okay, sorry, you're saying it right. 

1194
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:49,820
I don't think so, right, don't tell me what's between you and Derin. 

1195
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:58,040
Apologize ... 

1196
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:01,280
maybe better if you pay attention to their behavior. 

1197
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:06,120
I'm thinking of talking to Yasemin. 

1198
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:12,440
What? 

1199
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:13,980
This. 

1200
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:20,820
Why is that?

1201
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:27,100
I don't know, I know I don't like to tell those lies. 

1202
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:30,000
There is a big problem with Yasemin, right ... 

1203
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:34,700
... I have to talk about it and solve it, not with such lies. 

1204
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:40,220
I think such injustice is a great thing. 

1205
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:46,139
But I don't know how to tell Yasemin how to do it. 

1206
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:47,940
I do not know. 

1207
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:57,580
Listen here. 

1208
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:21,639
Long live Sister Bahar. 

1209
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:23,700
I installed a little peanut. 

1210
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:25,580
How was school today? 

1211
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:30,519
Look, the teacher gave me a dog sticker today, she actually wanted a cat. 

1212
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:32,820
But this is also very good. 

1213
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:35,620
Isn't your mother here? 

1214
01:47:37,180 --> 01:47:39,060
Baharcığım we are in the kitchen. 

1215
01:47:42,260 --> 01:47:44,580
Come on, let's say hello to your mother. 

1216
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:48,880
Excellent. 

1217
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:53,920
Good luck with. 

1218
01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:55,980
Welcome Bahar. 

1219
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,200
I found it cute.

1220
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:05,400
Let me help you, if you want, I'm not very good at a nice kitchen. 

1221
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:09,960
It is the greatest help to you to watch Ece right now. 

1222
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:15,240
I'll ask you at the last minute too, but is it possible you're staying a little late tonight? 

1223
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:17,040
Of course. 

1224
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:25,440
Are you looking at the earring? 

1225
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:27,600
Yes. 

1226
01:48:27,820 --> 01:48:28,860
They were very beautiful. 

1227
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:33,660
It's a gift from Murat, I mean, I'm not very elegant, but ... 

1228
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:39,220
... what we do is very careful and I use it because it has a very special meaning. 

1229
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:42,440
I understand. 

1230
01:48:43,820 --> 01:48:44,820
But it looks good. 

1231
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:46,240
Thanks. 

1232
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:49,719
Come on, Ececim. 

1233
01:48:57,140 --> 01:49:00,400
Go to your room now, get your toys ready, I'm coming. 

1234
01:49:06,020 --> 01:49:07,740
Let's see what this particular problem is. 

1235
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:12,299
Can I make something with a cup of tea or coffee?

1236
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:15,740
Of course, we don't ask when you came, look at the cups. 

1237
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:18,360
Filiz Hanımcığım these are fine ... 

1238
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:25,540
... take out a china now and it would be great if you clean the silverware. 

1239
01:49:34,340 --> 01:49:37,960
Sorry, I can't get the earrings that are so beautiful. 

1240
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:40,080
Thanks. 

1241
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:44,280
Is it a thank you for your birthday surprise? 

1242
01:49:44,660 --> 01:49:46,400
Really ... 

1243
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:51,599
... How can I say to have more heart? 

1244
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:55,040
Romance is at its peak. 

1245
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:01,920
Actually, it can be answered by a romantic meal. 

1246
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:05,320
Marriage needs things like this from time to time. 

1247
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:10,760
Well, you know, you had the last fan of these songs. 

1248
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,400
What did he gain her heart? 

1249
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:16,660
No. 

1250
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:20,660
Let's say he stabbed me in the back. 

1251
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:17,320
Derincig. 

1252
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:17,920
My mom.

1253
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:19,559
You look so beautiful. 

1254
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:22,620
I told everyone that I would play for us at night. 

1255
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:25,400
Mom, if I don't play tonight. 

1256
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:32,020
Why does that happen? Or everyone is looking forward to this and there is some practice before the exam. 

1257
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:35,640
Sight. 

1258
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:40,219
You are very beautiful but if you apply a little more mascara. 

1259
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:41,460
Well. 

1260
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:42,520
Go. 

1261
01:52:35,180 --> 01:52:36,780
You are ready? 

1262
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:43,360
My angel, how beautiful you are, wait, let's use it. 

1263
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:47,720
Come here. 

1264
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:50,260
But we choose them. 

1265
01:52:50,260 --> 01:52:56,240
They are at least dear, they never look, did you ever see the color of your outfit? 

1266
01:52:56,500 --> 01:53:01,100
But now how nice it will be to wear these whites now. 

1267
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:04,480
Look now look. 

1268
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:06,980
Let's take a walk. 

1269
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:10,660
Ms. Yasemin, I'm sorry if I don't attend dinner, right? 

1270
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:11,900
Oh!, why?

1271
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:15,720
So I'm on your side now in these clothes. 

1272
01:53:16,260 --> 01:53:18,060
You are so Beautiful? 

1273
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:23,139
Your friends are full of people and now there is no need, please, Ms. Yasemin. 

1274
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:33,040
Don't be silly Bahar, you weren't that wild and go to Ece. Help me with the table. 

1275
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:35,320
Here you have. 

1276
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:37,160
Come on. 

1277
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:42,540
Yes ... 

1278
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:45,140
... our princess has also arrived. 

1279
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:48,419
Show me your clothes. 

1280
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:49,900
Let's go back. 

1281
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:00,520
Marvelous. 

1282
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:10,340
Goodnight everyone. 

1283
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,400
You know Bahar. 

1284
01:54:13,620 --> 01:54:15,040
Yes yes, hello. 

1285
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:23,840
JeFiliz Hanimcığım, let's go to the table. 

1286
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:32,680
Yes, my Ruhi, my Sitareci, come like this. 

1287
01:54:34,020 --> 01:54:35,120
Aydancıg ... 

1288
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:39,799
... with Barlas's son. 

1289
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:43,280
It's me. 

1290
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:46,080
Come on son. 

1291
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:07,440
Look at me ... 

1292
01:55:07,900 --> 01:55:10,960
... are you messing with these export reports?

1293
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:12,960
Don't be stupid, what does that mean? 

1294
01:55:13,300 --> 01:55:14,300
No ... 

1295
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:16,520
... those values ​​can't be real. 

1296
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:21,420
Nothing to do. We are number one, we crush what we find. 

1297
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:24,080
Except you. 

1298
01:55:24,340 --> 01:55:25,340
Is that so? 

1299
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:28,260
What did you put on him, Yasemin? 

1300
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:32,380
I put gooseberries instead of carrots, I have such a special recipe. 

1301
01:55:32,380 --> 01:55:33,380
He is very wise. 

1302
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:42,480
Girls, you never see my nails. 

1303
01:55:42,980 --> 01:55:43,980
Let me see. 

1304
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:46,940
Where did you do that? 

1305
01:55:50,780 --> 01:55:55,480
Ay Derin, if you give it to Onur, the boy could not find something to eat. 

1306
01:55:55,900 --> 01:55:56,900
Thanks. 

1307
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:10,960
I feel honored? 

1308
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:12,160
I'll take it too. 

1309
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:16,019
Dad, can I have it too? 

1310
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:26,360
Well, my exam was very good to celebrate. 

1311
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:31,240
Congratulations. Congratulations. 

1312
01:56:31,540 --> 01:56:32,640
Thanks. 

1313
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:34,900
What proof was it?

1314
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,040
Harmony. 

1315
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:37,880
My daughter put a little. 

1316
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:39,100
Thanks Dad. 

1317
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:00,760
How did you get used to home? 

1318
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:03,400
Yes, not bad. 

1319
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:14,520
Ece's bedtime has come, isn't it Ececim? 

1320
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:18,200
Will you deposit me today, Sister Bahar? 

1321
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:19,560
Of course. 

1322
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:22,519
With your permission. 

1323
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:30,320
Good night. 

1324
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:31,719
My daughter good night. 

1325
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:33,480
Good night. 

1326
01:58:08,780 --> 01:58:10,940
I know you don't sleep, baby. 

1327
01:58:11,780 --> 01:58:14,019
I am aware of this little trick you did. 

1328
01:58:14,740 --> 01:58:16,420
These coincidences ... 

1329
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:19,100
... but I should tell you something ... 

1330
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:21,720
... eventually you will be a victim of damage. 

1331
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:25,640
Trust me, I know that man very well. 

1332
01:58:47,100 --> 01:58:48,480
What he wanted to say? 

1333
01:58:49,460 --> 01:58:51,460
Well, let me take this from two doors. 

1334
01:58:52,380 --> 01:58:53,760
A matter of taste, Aydan.

1335
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:56,580
But isn't the engine of this more powerful? 

1336
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:00,000
Well, the normal sports model will be like this. 

1337
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:03,360
I can't use it to be able to escape. 

1338
01:59:04,060 --> 01:59:07,780
That is why they are doing a young Aydancığç job, so that he can run away. 

1339
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:12,540
I won't stop crashing. 

1340
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:18,599
Actually, if you ask Onur, he knows better. Look, Onur, Aunt Aydan is consulting something. 

1341
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:19,880
Wait a minute dad. 

1342
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:22,640
Did you take the medicine? 

1343
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:26,080
I will start tomorrow. 

1344
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:27,940
Well, look, please don't interrupt. 

1345
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:33,120
You sit at the same table and eat ... 

1346
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:37,880
... what are you doing? Are you scared? 

1347
01:59:38,180 --> 01:59:41,200
Did I call my friend here or what did I do to do? 

1348
01:59:41,540 --> 01:59:42,980
Finish Murat, finish this job. 

1349
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,280
And they call the women gossip ... 

1350
01:59:52,260 --> 01:59:54,260
... Barlas, shall we get up?

1351
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:55,840
Let me kiss your mouth. 

1352
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:58,380
The fresh air that misunderstood Aydan was reduced. 

1353
01:59:58,380 --> 02:00:02,320
I have learned that I will learn but I will not forget this word. 

1354
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:06,099
You burned, I tell you, you burned, baby, let's go. 

1355
02:00:11,460 --> 02:00:13,340
Where are you, Yasemin? 

1356
02:00:15,740 --> 02:00:17,000
You're going? 

1357
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,260
Thank you. 

1358
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:23,640
Come on, let's see your health. 

1359
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:24,780
Ruhicig. 

1360
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:27,360
Health to your hands. 

1361
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:29,120
See you, cheers to your feet. 

1362
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:36,380
Yo Derincig ... 

1363
02:00:37,060 --> 02:00:38,720
... can you help me? 

1364
02:00:44,100 --> 02:00:46,900
Dad, did you say you came to Bahar in the morning? 

1365
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:48,280
No girl. 

1366
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:49,400
So what is this? 

1367
02:00:50,220 --> 02:00:51,220
I do not know. 

1368
02:00:52,460 --> 02:00:53,640
You learn to go. 

1369
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:56,480
I'm over here. 

1370
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:17,160
Derin. 

1371
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:21,500
Interested in this drinking problem ... 

1372
02:01:21,980 --> 02:01:23,419
should I be concerned? 

1373
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:24,920
Not.

1374
02:01:25,260 --> 02:01:27,260
My mom, of course, no. 

1375
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:35,000
Look, I had a bad day yesterday, so you know, school, exams or something ... 

1376
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:40,639
... but my harmony exam was really good, so I was relieved today. 

1377
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:11,480
Come sit down. 

1378
02:02:22,220 --> 02:02:29,880
You don't have to do anything Derin, bother you, you don't have to do anything, okay? 

1379
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:32,080
Really. 

1380
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:34,700
You are very important to us. 

1381
02:02:36,020 --> 02:02:41,880
Above all, I don't want you to feel bad about your health. 

1382
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:49,280
But, dear sacrifice your future for a small problem, a stress. 

1383
02:02:50,680 --> 02:02:54,980
Look, life requires some struggle, a little effort ... 

1384
02:02:55,920 --> 02:03:00,960
... so how can you be successful if you escape on the first difficulty? 

1385
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:03,740
Let me give you a secret ... 

1386
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:09,220
... these problems, these tensions and all of this is flying away.

1387
02:03:10,660 --> 02:03:14,700
But your success leads to a completely different life. 

1388
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:18,760
Mom ... 

1389
02:03:20,380 --> 02:03:23,000
... the only reason I'm worried isn't my exams. 

1390
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:29,600
I know, I know, I know, look, you misunderstood what happened between your father and us that night. 

1391
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:35,160
Look, we just lifted something small that night. 

1392
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:38,440
But my foot joined and I fell. 

1393
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:40,360
Really ... 

1394
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:44,560
... we couldn't tell you in that anger, but the exact situation. 

1395
02:03:46,460 --> 02:03:48,460
But now we have tied it to dessert. 

1396
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:50,420
We are good. 

1397
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:55,480
Look what it got me. 

1398
02:03:57,360 --> 02:03:58,799
Peace gift. 

1399
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:01,400
Now I'm also thinking ... 

1400
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:04,500
... if I do something romantic. 

1401
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:07,160
Like what? 

1402
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:09,240
I do not know that. 

1403
02:04:37,940 --> 02:04:42,839
Maybe we will organize a hotel on the weekend and make a reservation online.

1404
02:04:43,180 --> 02:04:44,480
All weekend? 

1405
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:45,480
Yes. 

1406
02:04:46,740 --> 02:04:47,740
You didn't like it. 

1407
02:04:49,700 --> 02:04:53,019
Great, great, great. 

1408
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:57,639
So let me make a great organization for you this time. 

1409
02:04:58,020 --> 02:04:59,020
Well. 

1410
02:05:02,020 --> 02:05:02,800
Good night mom. 

1411
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:03,860
Good night, lamb. 

1412
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:46,340
What are you doing here? 

1413
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:48,679
What are you doing here? 

1414
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:50,920
At home? 

1415
02:05:51,580 --> 02:05:52,960
Or in the kitchen? 

1416
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:02,160
I'm drinking water. 

1417
02:06:03,800 --> 02:06:05,240
Are you okay? 

1418
02:06:07,700 --> 02:06:08,760
I'm thinking. 

1419
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:11,360
What? 

1420
02:06:13,340 --> 02:06:15,620
All men came and spent my life ... 

1421
02:06:17,560 --> 02:06:22,000
... not all mean my loved ones, so my mother's dear husbands ... 

1422
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:24,440
... my friends' spouses ... 

1423
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:30,840
... I always thought it was so smart you couldn't get caught up in these stupid traps with the kid. 

1424
02:06:31,620 --> 02:06:32,640
I am not.

1425
02:06:34,040 --> 02:06:36,040
It was not necessary to speak big. 

1426
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:42,360
I'm drinking a glass of cold water on you, Murat. 

1427
02:06:46,740 --> 02:06:47,980
what do you mean? 

1428
02:06:48,700 --> 02:06:49,860
Speak clearly. 

1429
02:06:54,180 --> 02:06:55,680
I'll talk to Yasemin ... 

1430
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:58,740
... great injustice to you ... 

1431
02:07:01,060 --> 02:07:02,520
Why did you tell these lies? 

1432
02:07:04,460 --> 02:07:06,160
I didn't want such a thing from you. 

1433
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:12,059
I didn't lie to you. 

1434
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:15,919
You are lying. 

1435
02:07:20,720 --> 02:07:21,720
No. 

1436
02:07:26,440 --> 02:07:27,460
I don't say. 

1437
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:44,660
When I said let me explain everything, I wanted to tell you that I was thinking about you, I was worried about you, I don't want to be unfair to you. 

1438
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:50,740
How did you give those earrings to Yasemin or how would you do such a thing? 

1439
02:07:52,140 --> 02:07:54,140
I'm sorry ok. 

1440
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:55,980
Dad. 

1441
02:07:57,240 --> 02:08:01,219
I came to this place, is there something? Can you look at Murat Bey? 

1442
02:08:01,820 --> 02:08:02,820
Does something appear?

1443
02:08:04,180 --> 02:08:07,200
No, nothing, girl, can you take a look? Maybe I saw it wrong. 

1444
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:09,120
What happened, why did you get up? 

1445
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:10,719
Does your head hurt? 

1446
02:08:10,720 --> 02:08:12,960
Yes a little, but it's over now. 

1447
02:08:13,260 --> 02:08:14,800
We sleep, is it too late? 

1448
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:16,020
We slept. 

1449
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:17,320
OK. 

1450
02:08:18,240 --> 02:08:19,099
Good night father. 

1451
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:20,100
Good night, my daughter. 

1452
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:22,120
Get better, Bahar. 

1453
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:23,660
Thanks good night. 

1454
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:24,700
Good night. 

1455
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:38,860
Let's see the princess in the right bed. 

1456
02:08:39,260 --> 02:08:40,860
Won't you come? 

1457
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:44,080
No, but I'll wait at the door until you sleep. 

1458
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:50,219
Come on, good night, I'm here, I'll leave the door ajar, okay? 

1459
02:08:50,220 --> 02:08:51,580
Ok, good night. 

1460
02:08:51,580 --> 02:08:52,580
Good night. 

1461
02:09:11,900 --> 02:09:13,379
What are you doing? 

1462
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:20,720
You have busted the Bahar Prize. 

1463
02:09:21,140 --> 02:09:22,340
Enjoy your meal.

1464
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:27,220
A glass of something would go so well now Derin. 

1465
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:29,600
Come on. 

1466
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:36,840
Keep. 

1467
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:47,660
What are you looking for? 

1468
02:09:52,200 --> 02:09:53,300
Hotels. 

1469
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:58,260
A romantic weekend getaway with Onur Bey? 

1470
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:04,940
Of course, it's a lot of fun for my mom and dad, whether these peaceful gestures are flying in the air these days. 

1471
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:09,820
That is good. 

1472
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:16,700
So what are you going to pay with? 

1473
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:25,220
I promised I would do it with my mother's credit card organization, but there are so many hotels that I was officially bloated. 

1474
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:29,200
I'll help you. 

1475
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:30,720
Really? 

1476
02:10:31,100 --> 02:10:32,100
Of course. 

1477
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,120
Let's prepare a big surprise for them. 

1478
02:10:53,340 --> 02:10:54,340
Good Morning. 

1479
02:10:55,980 --> 02:10:56,980
Where are the girls? 

1480
02:10:57,500 --> 02:10:59,060
I woke up. 

1481
02:10:59,380 --> 02:11:01,280
Oh did you wake up?

1482
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:05,240
Good morning, let me be the victim of my life. 

1483
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:08,420
Derin comes, Bahar not when I woke up. 

1484
02:11:08,780 --> 02:11:09,780
Well. 

1485
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:12,719
I'm leaving, girl, see you. 

1486
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:13,720
I will see. 

1487
02:11:15,940 --> 02:11:16,940
Where are you? 

1488
02:11:18,940 --> 02:11:20,280
This will be over. 

1489
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:18,020
What did I tell you? 

1490
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:20,900
What did I tell you? 

1491
02:12:21,260 --> 02:12:25,180
Didn't I say to keep you away from me and the people around me? 

1492
02:12:26,540 --> 02:12:30,460
What do we do now, what do we do now? 

1493
02:12:32,500 --> 02:12:37,100
Now you will call those people and say that you will not work with them again. 

1494
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:39,700
Get it now? 

1495
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:42,720
Well. 

1496
02:12:43,140 --> 02:12:44,140
Call. 

1497
02:12:49,140 --> 02:12:51,420
I will listen out loud. 

1498
02:12:55,940 --> 02:12:56,559
Hello. 

1499
02:12:56,560 --> 02:12:57,560
Hello. 

1500
02:12:58,420 --> 02:13:01,260
Thank you Yasemin for everything ... 

1501
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:05,400
... I called to say that I can't work with you. 

1502
02:13:07,880 --> 02:13:10,320
What happened? Is there a problem?

1503
02:13:11,240 --> 02:13:18,260
No, no problem, I received a new job offer and I have to prefer it better. 

1504
02:13:18,980 --> 02:13:22,339
Sorry, so I'm happy for you, of course ... 

1505
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:25,500
... you know, what should we do with the weekly job? 

1506
02:13:26,280 --> 02:13:28,500
Someday I will get income, thank you very much. 

1507
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:32,200
No problem, I'm going to ask something, right? 

1508
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:35,360
I'm fine, I'm fine, no problem. 

1509
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:38,160
OK see you. 

1510
02:13:42,740 --> 02:13:44,740
Don't ever bring me here again. 

1511
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:49,600
Or do you understand that I don't just squeeze your throat? 

1512
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:51,720
Suburban pink. 

1513
02:14:35,120 --> 02:14:37,559
What happened to this girl while she was still. 

1514
02:14:38,460 --> 02:14:40,580
Youth is here and there. 

1515
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:03,320
17:00 Hotel Gama. 

1516
02:15:12,760 --> 02:15:15,600
Oh stay the day Bahar. 

1517
02:15:21,260 --> 02:15:23,480
Come on, those cheeses will run out. 

1518
02:15:32,240 --> 02:15:35,200
Turn on the phone once or once.

1519
02:18:46,480 --> 02:18:48,139
I assumed you were here. 

1520
02:20:53,820 --> 02:20:55,420
Did you take your medicine? 

1521
02:20:56,600 --> 02:20:57,920
Yes, I drank now. 

1522
02:21:24,660 --> 02:21:25,660
Sister. 

1523
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:27,960
Sister. 

1524
02:21:28,860 --> 02:21:30,420
Where are you, sister? 

1525
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:36,320
Where are you, sister? 

1526
02:21:41,980 --> 02:21:43,000
Sister. 

1527
02:21:47,440 --> 02:21:48,440
Sister. 

1528
02:21:52,720 --> 02:21:53,720
Sister. 

1529
02:21:54,900 --> 02:21:55,539
Sister. 

1530
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:57,180
Wake up sister. 

1531
02:21:58,660 --> 02:22:00,660
Sister awake. 

1532
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:04,800
Sister. 

1533
02:22:11,800 --> 02:22:13,800
Room service came for sure. 

1534
02:22:21,420 --> 02:22:22,460
Orange juice ... 

1535
02:22:26,420 --> 02:22:27,420
Yasemin? 

1536
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Well ...
