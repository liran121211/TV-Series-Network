1
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,199
Are you okay, Yasemin? 

2
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,020
Yasemin? 

3
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,100
Yasemin? 

4
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,920
Are you okay? 

5
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
No I'm not. 

6
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,380
As long as you continue to act like this ... 

7
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,198
I'm not going to be okay. 

8
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,100
What's going on Yasemin? 

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,040
What happened, Aydan. 

10
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,620
Murat is cheating on me. 

11
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,420
And everyone knows it. 

12
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,660
How, Yasemin? 

13
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,900
Don't be silly, what do you say? 

14
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
Yasemin. 

15
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,660
What's going on, Yasemin? 

16
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,679
Simply amazing. 

17
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,700
An Oscar-winning performance. 

18
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,200
Don't pretend you don't know. 

19
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,320
What should we do, Yasemin? 

20
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,300
We do not know. We do not know. 

21
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,960
What does Murat ağa say about this woman? Look at Yasemin ... 

22
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,980
... from everyone at this table. 

23
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,960
This is not from this man.

24
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,856
I have worked at the fund for forty years. 

25
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,140
If you say something, Ruhi. 

26
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,140
What should i say 

27
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,440
Let's ask a friend if you want, let's see. 

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's possible. It is not? 

29
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,420
What will he say? 

30
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
If Murat. 

31
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,960
Ağa, four-place bomber. Say something. Defend yourself. 

32
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Stop Barlas. 

33
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,260
Sükut, it came from confession, isn't that Murat? 

34
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,019
You have no face to speak. 

35
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,820
Is it just Murat? 

36
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,800
You do not have any. 

37
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,100
I met you, my friend. 

38
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,459
How did you hide this misfortune, this joke? 

39
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,880
How did you digest it? 

40
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,040
What kind of people are you? 

41
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,500
I mean, Ay Yasemin. 

42
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,060
Say ah. 

43
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,579
You are also numbering without shame. 

44
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,680
Are you crossing the wave behind me? 

45
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
...I wonder.

46
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,920
Does that happen, Yasemin? 

47
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,680
Done. 

48
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,320
I won't be able to take this nonsense anymore. 

49
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,120
Enough. Enough, Yasemin. Just one stop. 

50
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,460
Why Murat? 

51
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,560
We were going to express our feelings. 

52
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,920
Sight. Now we do what you want. 

53
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,660
I am boldly expressing my feelings in front of everyone. 

54
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,200
What happened? You do not like? 

55
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,620
Is this here? 

56
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,660
Is it your turn to speak here now? 

57
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,900
I have said that? 

58
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,120
My Yasemin, my sugar. Sight. Calm down. Sit down. 

59
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,596
Your blood pressure will go out. Come. 

60
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,300
What should I calm down, Sitare? 

61
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,780
What will I calm down? 

62
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,280
Or you are one and you brought me to the clamp. 

63
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,880
I know like my name. 

64
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,580
You have already arranged this plate to cover it. 

65
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,360
No looting. The game is over here.

66
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,360
I know. I know. 

67
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,640
You are all in this business one by one. 

68
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,659
I also met you, my friend. 

69
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,920
But it's my fault. Should I say something? It's my fault. 

70
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,680
I would never come here. 

71
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,540
It would not be part of this misfortune. 

72
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,480
But Yasemin. 

73
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,740
What are you saying? 

74
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,540
Sit down. 

75
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,636
In disgrace to the nation. 

76
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,400
Yasemin, calm down. 

77
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,479
Not Murat yet? Yet. 

78
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,840
God damn you all. 

79
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,740
Yasemin. 

80
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
I am shocked. 

81
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,420
I can not believe. 

82
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,680
I am in shock right now. Pain came to my head. 

83
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,659
Open that phone. 

84
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,640
Open up now, Murat. Just turn that phone on. 

85
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,780
Yes it is ... 

86
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,719
... something else ... 

87
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,580
... I don't know, one of you knows.

88
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,680
You have the mic, Ruhi. 

89
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,220
But you don't have beans in your mouth. 

90
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,780
Aydan ... 

91
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,580
... you can't stop either, you ask your husband. 

92
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,740
You're talking nonsense, Barlas. 

93
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,479
Oh Barlas. What are you saying? With Yasemin ... 

94
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,480
... Murat's marriage turns silver, my brother. 

95
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,400
What is this talking about? 

96
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,659
Don't make the man sick. We'll get mad ... 

97
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,800
... he yelled, you know. 

98
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,260
Who knows? 

99
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,380
Nobody knows. 

100
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,960
Yasemin has officially made paranoia. 

101
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,400
You did not see it? The woman exploded like a volcano. 

102
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,400
This burned the coatings completely. 

103
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,480
In fact, I've never seen Yasemin like this. 

104
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,660
Where is that cold-blooded woman? 

105
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,300
I understand, of course.

106
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,340
It is not an easy thing. 

107
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
What I don't understand .. 

108
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,540
What Aydan don't you understand? 

109
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,120
Here is the mode of woman accompanying her husband. 

110
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,676
She kidnapped the goats, she brushed the woman. 

111
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,700
What do not you understand? 

112
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,520
Well why did he stop us? 

113
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,040
Isn't it ridiculous to be suspicious of you and me? 

114
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,599
How do we know, dear? 

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,320
Can we keep it if we know? 

116
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Isn't it, Ruhi? 

117
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Then. 

118
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,660
Yes, but. 

119
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,340
This is sugar for women, you say. 

120
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,560
Men know such things, but they hide them. 

121
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,040
Joins the crime. 

122
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,900
Like a black box. 

123
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,380
What is there, what is a secret registry. Snatching. 

124
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,419
What door? 

125
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,400
Why did the incident turn to us, friend?

126
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,540
The wounded man is comfortable. What is it for me? 

127
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,460
Perhaps Murat opened up to one of his friends. 

128
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,340
Whatever happens, maybe one was spilled. 

129
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,820
Yasemin is screaming about it. 

130
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,340
No Ruhi ... 

131
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,460
... don't be the black box. Don't say I know everything. 

132
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,660
Aydan ... 

133
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,400
... What are you saying? 

134
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,880
Unfortunately, you are the only suspect, honey. 

135
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,640
It is obvious that Barlas is news of the world. 

136
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,840
Look, tell me if you know something. 

137
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,260
Don't tire me. I got nervous. 

138
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:16,960
Do not tire. 

139
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
Barlas ... 

140
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
... don't. 

141
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,300
Did Murat tell you something? 

142
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,860
What did he say? 

143
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,400
Look, if you know something, say it, we will get very angry. 

144
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,980
I say Aydan. 

145
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,280
Brother, can we have our car? 

146
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
Immediately Mr.

147
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,819
You're officially paranoid, Yasemin. 

148
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,140
Where did you get that everyone knows? 

149
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,860
Not paranoia. 

150
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,340
I'm sure. 

151
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,740
How are you sure? 

152
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,180
Because Bahar said. 

153
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
Yes? 

154
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,700
Besides that. 

155
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,120
Don't trust your friends, Yasemin said. 

156
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,280
Everyone is aware of the situation. 

157
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,020
But nobody makes noise. He said. 

158
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,640
It wasn't a lie, Murat. I'm sure. 

159
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,260
Why are you going to Bahar, Yasemin? 

160
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Why? 

161
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
I do not know. 

162
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,460
You're thoroughly mixing things up Yasemin. 

163
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,380
Yasemin ... 

164
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,479
... I am your interlocutor. 

165
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,540
I am married to you. We need to talk. 

166
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,340
I'm glad you remember. 

167
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,200
Yes, Murat, we are married.

168
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,760
You cheated on me too. I'm going too and ... 

169
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,160
I wanted to talk. This. 

170
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,579
This attitude is of no use to anyone, Yasemin. 

171
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,180
And no one. 

172
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,340
Yahu's house is our house. 

173
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,080
Both of us. We're on it. 

174
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,980
Every mallet, every pick you hit hurt us ... 

175
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,180
Yasemin. 

176
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,020
If we fix this, we will. Nobody else. 

177
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,000
We can? I don't know him either. 

178
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,540
But we have to do something. 

179
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,160
At least we have to talk. 

180
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
What did you do? 

181
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,540
They shouldn't be fighting. 

182
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,000
Are you looking, Sitare? 

183
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,160
I don't know, honey. 

184
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
What should Aydan look for? 

185
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,396
As if Murat fell in love with the other woman ... 

186
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,620
... he will take him to the wedding ... 

187
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,416
Husband and wife are not allowed.

188
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Leave these jobs. 

189
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,640
Yes. 

190
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,060
Excuse me guys. 

191
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,340
We are very tired. 

192
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,996
We couldn't find the perpetrator for a minute, where are you going? 

193
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,136
Much work is waiting, Barlas. Add yours ... 

194
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,000
... you know, for example, that the company has food products. 

195
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,720
You have to deal. You know. Go. 

196
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,360
Let's talk, sugar. 

197
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,200
We will call you sugar. I will see. 

198
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,740
I will see. 

199
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,500
Goodbye. 

200
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,780
I will see. 

201
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,300
This is every time. 

202
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,440
Getting angry. 

203
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,260
I will call. Who are you looking for? 

204
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,680
Maybe they kiss and smell after a fight. 

205
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
What it is for you? 

206
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
What? Is a lie? 

207
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,180
Barlas. 

208
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
I will call. 

209
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,660
Who are you looking for?

210
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,480
Are we going to keep quiet like this? 

211
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,340
Are we not talking again? 

212
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
No. 

213
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,780
Not now. 

214
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
We always delay. 

215
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,500
We always ignore. 

216
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,420
We will talk about that at the end. 

217
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,219
How far will we escape Yasemin? 

218
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,820
Oh please. 

219
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,800
I am not in a position to have anyone at this time. 

220
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,160
I'm tired. I have no power. Please. 

221
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,100
Look Yasemin. 

222
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,720
I really care what you say in psychiatry. 

223
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
I always think. 

224
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,440
I don't want you to be sad, Yasemin. 

225
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,540
Never. 

226
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,160
Let's do something. Please. 

227
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,120
Your phone is ringing ... 

228
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,540
... and we both know who the caller is. 

229
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,680
I also don't think it's time to talk. 

230
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,920
Nor is it time for therapy.

231
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
I agree. 

232
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,480
How beautiful it was. 

233
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,420
For the first time in a long time ... 

234
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,900
... we both agree. 

235
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,700
Your vehicle is ready, sir. 

236
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Thank you. 

237
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,960
You have to get rid of these suckers first. 

238
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
But do not worry. 

239
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,460
I'll take care. 

240
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,100
You ... 

241
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
... I ... 

242
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,300
... just the two of us ... 

243
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,020
I know you love me. 

244
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,300
Because I love you too. 

245
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,959
Yasemin, just a second. 

246
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,300
Mrs. Yasemin ... 

247
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,219
Murat Bey came back early. 

248
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,020
I hope nothing bad happened. 

249
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,220
Nerd. 

250
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,099
My head hurts a little. I guess the migraine ... 

251
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,140
... Mrs. Filiz. I do not know. 

252
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,339
I couldn't get to the noise or something there.

253
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,540
I'll take a pain reliever and go to bed. 

254
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,000
I worked like crazy. 

255
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,020
We put the boys together. We made a reservation. 

256
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,360
We pay so much truck. 

257
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,840
Let the woman come. Don't leave stones on stone. 

258
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,340
Look at you, Sitare. 

259
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,140
Grief, darling. 

260
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,980
Are you saying for three cents? 

261
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,760
I am not in money. You know. 

262
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,536
It comes from our mouth and our nose, my dear wife. 

263
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,199
If we had known who would Murat take? 

264
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:49,859
There's no space. 

265
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,120
So it was inefficient. In my opinion. 

266
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,619
If you don't touch my mother ... 

267
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,980
... I don't have to talk to your son. 

268
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,939
Don't pretend Barlas. 

269
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
What number? 

270
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,439
I didn't say anything, it's not there. 

271
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,020
But you already know who you are.

272
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,596
If you knew why you would ask? 

273
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,300
I swear I don't know. 

274
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,220
One minute. 

275
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,300
You know someone like you say. 

276
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,080
Look, tell me, let me love your eyes. This torture is over. 

277
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Sitos ... 

278
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
... Don't eat me. 

279
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,940
You officially wrote the conspiracy theory, Barlas. 

280
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,880
I don't know who I should know. 

281
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,320
How many times am I going to say? 

282
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,620
Like you don't know Yasemin. 

283
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,460
The husband and wife say nothing. 

284
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,099
My secret sugar is reserved. 

285
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,680
Where? 

286
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,860
I'm going to sleep. 

287
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,976
Don't let my face fall into my eyes tomorrow. 

288
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,980
The stress mites are already ruined. 

289
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,500
Botox melted and my fillers melted. 

290
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
Lay down. 

291
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Onur. 

292
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
You are early.

293
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Do not ask. 

294
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,160
Events. Events ... 

295
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,940
Well, we'll talk later. Berkaylar is waiting. 

296
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,960
Is it the tribe of this? 

297
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,560
Don't start Barlas again, please. 

298
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,300
You will not play if you are offended, champion! 

299
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,240
I haven't started playing yet. You will know when you play! 

300
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,960
Look ... 

301
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,400
The artist keeps his tail straight. 

302
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,760
Your son is the artist Sitoş. 

303
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,240
Artist ... Artist ... 

304
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,020
I remind you who you call an artist in our son, my sweet. 

305
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,100
What do you think you're doing? 

306
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,840
Didn't I call myself at night? 

307
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,620
Don't call me at night. We've alredy talk about that. 

308
00:17:22,598 --> 00:17:23,598
Well. 

309
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,920
Mrs. Yasemin, I'm going. 

310
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,840
Mrs. Filiz, would you wait a minute? 

311
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,700
I separated them and I will give it to you.

312
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,000
These are for those in the neighborhood. I have reserved them for you. 

313
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,620
There are some from Ece that shrink before use. 

314
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,719
They will also be in Gülsüm. 

315
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,960
It will be highly appreciated. Mine will be happy. Thanks. 

316
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,220
Meaning. 

317
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,720
Mrs. Yasemin, Ece's baby Bahar. 

318
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,780
Ah, he must have entered by mistake. 

319
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,760
I'd take it home if we didn't find out. 

320
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,320
No, Filiz doesn't exist. There is no mistake. I also put it on. 

321
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,520
But Mrs. Yasemin, Ece, you shouldn't be upset, you love it. 

322
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,780
Ece has many more toys. 

323
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,780
Do not worry. Let this go to other children. 

324
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,056
Let them play too. 

325
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,540
Well. If you say it. 

326
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,200
Come back again. 

327
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,300
I will see. 

328
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:28,860
Well.

329
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,080
Okay, Asim Bey, I'm not sending to school then. 

330
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,760
Yes, yes, so I was worried that she had a fever. 

331
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,780
Of course, I know, that's how it is ... 

332
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,100
I know it doesn't matter. 

333
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,260
I'm giving antipyretics. 

334
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,580
It's okay, Asim Bey is okay. 

335
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,800
If there is any improvement, I will let you know. Thanks. 

336
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,440
The eggs are boiled. I also made the tea. 

337
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,800
I did not produce fruit either. Nobody is eating. 

338
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,080
I see everyone has a surprise today. 

339
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,020
I thought you would be happy mom. 

340
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,900
Run girl! Run baby Runs! 

341
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,800
Don't run, don't run! Running is prohibited. 

342
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,959
What kind of table is this? 

343
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,960
I prepared. Come on, sit down. 

344
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,760
Thanks girl. 

345
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,240
Enjoy your meal. Come on. Come on mom.

346
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,040
We could not talk. How was your dinner? 

347
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,000
It was a very modern place. Everyone says so. 

348
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,680
Fabulous. 

349
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,720
It was very revealing, Mom. 

350
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,580
So I'm asking for details. For example, your boss was very good. 

351
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,899
What was their food like? 

352
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,220
Well it's great. Okay, let's not do anything. This ... 

353
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,520
Let's enjoy the beautiful table. Go. 

354
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,680
Cheers to my daughter's hands. 

355
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,700
The man eats from the daughter's hand is another. 

356
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,240
Enjoy your food, daddy. I want everyone to think like you. 

357
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,600
I think like my father. 

358
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,940
By the way, don't look at Derin, my head is very busy. 

359
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,300
It was very nice, everything. 

360
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,380
It was very nice. 

361
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,960
Ece, I spoke to your doctor, my lamb ...

362
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,360
We will rest you today. You're not going to school ... 

363
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,760
... sit down with your aunt Filiz. Very good honey? 

364
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,580
I'll take care of my work and come to you right away. 

365
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,440
I'm Murat, and you're dropping Derin at school. 

366
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,300
I will not go to school. 

367
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,720
So ... 

368
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,240
I say if I haven't been in that crowd for a while. 

369
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,680
It would be better for me to stay home for a few more days. 

370
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,460
I work here. 

371
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,720
Derin no. As you know, there is very little left for the exam. 

372
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,720
I don't want you to miss a lesson. 

373
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,960
Absenteeism will also be a problem. 

374
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,800
Look how beautiful your father will leave you at school. 

375
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,260
I am a super mother. 

376
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,379
You already thought of everything for me. 

377
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,600
You have no right to speak to me anyway.

378
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,940
If you did something, mom. Give us a chip for all of us. 

379
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,460
You control us all from where you sit. You work, you go to school ... 

380
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,880
You don't have to get so tired. 

381
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,620
When I make that breakfast or something ... 

382
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,920
I thought my daughter grew up all of a sudden, but ... 

383
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
I mean ... 

384
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,540
The sane movements also had an end. 

385
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,679
You proved to be a true teenager. I swear ... 

386
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,440
... Thank you. 

387
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,820
My daughter ... 

388
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,600
... we'll be late let's go. 

389
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,320
All right, dad 

390
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,680
... take my bag and come. Inevitable ... 

391
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,200
... orders from great place. 

392
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,960
Enjoy your meal. 

393
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
I also go out. 

394
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
I will let you go. 

395
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,080
I'll be a little late if you want to go to the company today. 

396
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,939
Let's sit down and chat?

397
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:03,960
Nerd. 

398
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,680
Let's not interrupt the order of the children. Don't be surprised by your routines for now. 

399
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,740
What routine? 

400
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,740
What routine? Don't you care about our experience? 

401
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,280
What? 

402
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,660
Are you not aware of what we live for the love of God? 

403
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,180
What order? Is there a request? 

404
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,300
Derin is right. It really uses a chip on us ... 

405
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,360
... to relax. Get rid. 

406
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,200
Murat, I am aware, of course, of what is happening. 

407
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,479
As a result, I am not the lover. 

408
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,120
I'm ready. Lets go dad. 

409
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,480
Here you have. I see you in the evening. 

410
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,639
Won't you open it? 

411
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,060
This is Aydan. 

412
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,440
She will be gossiping now. I'll call you later. 

413
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,000
Well, bye, bye. 

414
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,179
It does not open, it does not open. 

415
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,220
He never did that.

416
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,240
What happened, Ruhi? The fight shouldn't have grown. 

417
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,139
Do not worry. There is nothing. 

418
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,780
Why don't you open it? 

419
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,540
Today ... 

420
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,980
... I'm going to stop by Murat. I learn from him. 

421
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,240
I don't have that much time, Ruhi. 

422
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,620
Besides, if our work is left to Murat ... 

423
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,640
He will tell you something. You will accept. 

424
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,340
What a question, nothing. It is not my concern, my life. 

425
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,280
In your calm, in your comfort. 

426
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,960
Why don't you take care of your own business? 

427
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
What does that mean? 

428
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,220
Leave people alone. 

429
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,760
Yasemin is my friend. I am in support. 

430
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,160
Their problem is not supporting Aydan. 

431
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
What was I going to say? 

432
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
Confusion. 

433
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Chaos. 

434
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,440
Sadness. Tears. 

435
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,020
You officially love them. 

436
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,640
Also...

437
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,740
... this is how you go about collecting gossip. I know. 

438
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,460
Officially sad ... 

439
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,860
... you're a nourished person, Aydan. What else can I tell you? 

440
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,419
I wanted to. 

441
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,280
I didn't even know they were upset. 

442
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,780
But apparently there is something you know. 

443
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,480
Maybe if you tell me, I can act like you, Ruhi. 

444
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,940
I don't know anything, Aydan. 

445
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,140
I'll be ready and out. I have a job. 

446
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,080
The coffee is good too. 

447
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,260
Sitare, good morning darling. 

448
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,040
I called Yasemin but she is not answering now. 

449
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
Really? 

450
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,420
I didn't speak either. 

451
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,139
Yasemin's phone ... 

452
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,740
... if it didn't open, my sweet. We have to confiscate. 

453
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,920
Do we jump in and go? What are you saying?

454
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,940
You may really need our support right now. 

455
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,736
Okay sugar, okay. I am preparing immediately. 

456
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
I'll call when I leave. 

457
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,420
What's that? You got to the bottom of the conspiracy and diabetes again. 

458
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,140
I think the agenda is hot. 

459
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,419
What happened, Sitare. 

460
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,520
Yasemin wasn't on her phone. 

461
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,760
The woman does not open the phone, does not open it. 

462
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,340
You are crazy? 

463
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,940
Are you done with that now? 

464
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,379
Everyone like you, darling? 

465
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,580
It's not in Yasemin's story. 

466
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,900
Zero mistake woman. Next. 

467
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,880
Next. Yesterday it failed but next. 

468
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,380
It does not work. 

469
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,760
Speaking of malfunction, Onur Bey doesn't exist? 

470
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,080
Aren't they up yet? 

471
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,940
He is up.

472
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,840
He made his breakfast. 

473
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,200
He went to work early, honey. 

474
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,200
Look to you. 

475
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,899
Your mind is with me ... 

476
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,660
... as high as leg ... 

477
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,020
... I'll tell you something Sitare. Please don't be. 

478
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,420
You made this boy, but you couldn't. 

479
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,540
Ah Barlas, ah Barlas. 

480
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,820
Maybe it's trying to get into your eyes. 

481
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,440
Have you ever thought honey? 

482
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,600
No. Because there is no such thing. 

483
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,699
Where are you? 

484
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,680
Sitare work. 

485
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,820
As I do every day. 

486
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,980
Did it seem strange to you? 

487
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
I do this every day. 

488
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,399
I am a businessman. I have a white collar. 

489
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,555
I'm going to work, I'm coming home. I'm going to work, I'm coming home. 

490
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,879
I'm going to work, I'm coming home. I'm going to work, I'm coming home. 

491
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,760
Moron.

492
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,919
They are all unstable. 

493
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,520
You are competing with him because he is a kid like a leg. 

494
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,820
Who is a teenager and who is an adult is not known. 

495
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
I swelled up. 

496
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,840
Finally. 

497
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,676
I'm a little mad at you but ... 

498
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,660
... how many days have you neglected me, love? 

499
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,179
Listen carefully. The situation is urgent. 

500
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,760
Now go straight to Onur. 

501
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,379
Sadri Bey is you ... 

502
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,560
... you say he named me as his new assistant, Onur bey. 

503
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,200
Did you get it so far? 

504
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,540
I understand. 

505
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,600
What is Onur? What did he drink? 

506
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,540
Who came? Who did not come? What did he do? What did he not do? 

507
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,080
You report everything to me. 

508
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,080
How to spy? 

509
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,360
It's like spying. 

510
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,380
Don't wake the bird, it's okay. 

511
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,300
Well.

512
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,020
Let's look at peanuts. Let me see. Let me see. 

513
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,000
Will the sparse brain do this? 

514
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,880
Are you going to buy coffee? Bring it to me. 

515
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,060
I have another job. Take it honey. 

516
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,939
Surprise. 

517
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,380
Not a pleasant surprise at all. 

518
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,900
What are you doing here? 

519
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,320
Can you come without such notice? 

520
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,980
They all have limits. 

521
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,220
Everything has a routine, Bahar. 

522
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,560
You have reached that roof door. This is the workplace. 

523
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,720
Sit well. 

524
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,580
Look Bahar. 

525
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
You are challenging me. 

526
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,240
Come on, that's enough. 

527
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,100
Turn on the phone when it doesn't. 

528
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,180
I'm not hungry. Then you break. If I don't, I can't. 

529
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,660
I do not speak. 

530
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,760
Why do you make me in such difficult situations? 

531
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,780
Am I pushing you?

532
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,400
Yes, you are defiant. You are looking for me when it is not possible. 

533
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,820
I don't pick up the phone it's breaking. 

534
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,860
Bahar, if I don't, I can't. 

535
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,260
Then I can't speak. 

536
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,720
Why do you make me in such difficult situations? 

537
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
Why is that? 

538
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,760
I'm going then darling. 

539
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,480
It does not work well. 

540
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,000
Your wife was resting at my door. 

541
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,600
I came to report it. 

542
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,460
Being caught unprepared. 

543
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,080
Oh, that's another matter. 

544
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,060
What are you trying to do? 

545
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,620
You said ridiculous things to Yasemin. 

546
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,960
Did I say stupid things? 

547
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,220
Yes. 

548
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,200
What is happening? 

549
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,680
You must have gone crazy. 

550
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,720
His wife comes to my door. 

551
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,060
Damn it. You are not, not this. 

552
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,780
I told him ...

553
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,760
... it would be better if you spoke to Murat. 

554
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,680
What else did I say? 

555
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,520
Does he also say he's walking on me? 

556
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,340
Yasemin is cold blooded. 

557
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,280
Does not do that. Why are you laughing? 

558
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,919
I know Yasemin. Does not do that. 

559
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:37,980
Yasemin. 

560
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:38,680
Yes. 

561
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,480
Cold blood. 

562
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
Yes. 

563
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,540
By God, it wasn't like that, dear. 

564
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
Approached. 

565
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,400
He walked a lot on me. 

566
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,440
It is what it is ... 

567
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,376
... I'm already talking about these things and I'm choking you ... 

568
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
I didn't come here. 

569
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,860
I came to inform you. 

570
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,679
Because I think about you. 

571
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,800
So you don't get in trouble. 

572
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,699
Seeing Yasemin like this ... 

573
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,920
... I was naturally afraid. 

574
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,340
It attacks you, it does something. 

575
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,760
I wish I hadn't come.

576
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,940
Because the power of your husbands is enough for me. 

577
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,180
I'll say something ... 

578
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,860
... that you're going to be able to draw me like this ... 

579
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,600
... if you join in and talk like that? 

580
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,240
Maybe you can solve your problems. 

581
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
Come on thanks. 

582
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,020
Well well. I am sorry. 

583
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,580
Sorry to yell, Bahar. 

584
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,580
Sit down, Bahar. 

585
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,879
Okay, I shouldn't be yelling. Excuse me. 

586
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,740
I am nervous. 

587
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,340
You are right. 

588
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,140
Nor should it have come like this. 

589
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,680
Yes. 

590
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,699
But what should I do, Murat? 

591
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,720
So I was worried about you. 

592
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,540
You didn't open my phone. 

593
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,760
Yasemin is going crazy. 

594
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,040
I have my mind. I was wondering about you. It's a crime? 

595
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,500
So I have no choice. 

596
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,080
Anyway early ...

597
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,800
... I left because there is no one in the company. 

598
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,780
I enter as a shadow. 

599
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,480
So I thought I'd leave when I got there. 

600
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,700
Well well. 

601
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,420
Don't drop your face right away. 

602
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,980
If anyone sees ... 

603
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,020
I thought you'd say I came to speak ... 

604
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,320
No one knows anyway. 

605
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,160
However, you didn't tell Yasemin like that. 

606
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,440
Your friends know. 

607
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,980
You said things like they were cheating on you. 

608
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Because it is. 

609
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,860
I guess I don't have a lie. 

610
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,500
Who knows? 

611
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,020
He said. Who knows, Bahar? 

612
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
Sitare. 

613
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,620
Sitare. 

614
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,620
Yes. 

615
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,920
How do you know? 

616
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,920
How do I know you know, Murat. 

617
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,560
How do you know what it knows? 

618
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,000
It occurred to me because ...

619
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,480
He said publicly, you are the lover. 

620
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,540
It came to you. 

621
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,420
He told me that I seduce you. 

622
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,200
If I don't match my foot ... 

623
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,720
... I knew you would. He threatened such threats. 

624
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,580
But it's funny. Of course, I didn't take it seriously. 

625
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,500
He has no way of doing anything to me. 

626
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,360
So sure. 

627
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,580
It is not like this? 

628
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,280
Maybe as you say, you are right. 

629
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,720
Tried to dump it empty and keep it full. 

630
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,400
I also dug, I ate. How pure. 

631
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,740
Not important. 

632
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,640
Somehow soon everyone will learn Bahar. 

633
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
How is that? 

634
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Get it going. 

635
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,340
I'll talk to Yasemin. 

636
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,160
Our marriage is not working. I will say that we part. 

637
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,780
Really? 

638
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,900
Yes. 

639
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
I'm going to say something.

640
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,500
You're not doing this for me, are you? 

641
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,340
No. 

642
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,120
Our marriage is over, Bahar. 

643
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,860
We were just playing. For false ... 

644
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,900
... we are with everyone. 

645
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
I did not see it. 

646
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,060
But now I see it. 

647
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,860
Look, we can't even talk. 

648
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,799
Will we have dinner at night? 

649
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,719
You thought, Murat. 

650
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,220
I swear I have no secret purpose. 

651
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,800
As such primitive people ... 

652
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,440
... we will just feed it. 

653
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,299
I make meatballs for you. 

654
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,600
We put two wafers on top. 

655
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,940
It's actually a good idea. 

656
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,419
Great on wafers. 

657
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,220
But no, Bahar. 

658
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,860
Without speaking freely with Yasemin. 

659
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,220
I know it's okay. 

660
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,220
You are right. I'm not saying anything. 

661
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,540
But at least let's have a coffee.

662
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,480
So we can do that too. 

663
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,980
Well. 

664
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,400
Okay, deal done. 

665
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,060
How do you say. 

666
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,540
But I think Yasemin won't talk to you today. 

667
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,900
Sadly, I think so too. But ... 

668
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,920
... that day will finally come and we'll talk. 

669
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,120
For some reason, it seems like that day will never come to me. You know? 

670
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,400
I'll talk to Yasemin. 

671
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,260
Good luck. 

672
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,640
Well then I'm running away. 

673
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,340
But I also trust the universe. It's true? 

674
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,480
Maybe a miracle will bring you to me. 

675
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,760
That's what I say for coffee. 

676
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,300
Maybe your talk will end early. 

677
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,720
Perhaps. 

678
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Good luck. 

679
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,980
Look what I'm going to say. 

680
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,080
What are you doing here? 

681
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,480
As I said Murat bey ...

682
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,740
I received a job offer that I cannot refuse. 

683
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,779
So please don't look at my fault. 

684
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,460
Are you sure. 

685
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,060
Good, Bahar. You already decided. Goodbye. 

686
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:31,879
You have a good day. 

687
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,880
Goodbye. 

688
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,420
Ağa ... 

689
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,500
... Sadri asked for reports. 

690
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,920
Wait a second, I'll be back. 

691
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
What reports? 

692
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,020
Exporting is one thing. I'll be here for a minute. 

693
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,720
Why did you come this morning? 

694
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,420
He came to say that he was going to quit and found a better job. 

695
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,420
You listened. 

696
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,320
How gorgeous. 

697
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,620
Why does it come to you? If so, let it go. 

698
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,720
Oh I called. 

699
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,335
I said continue until I find someone, but he said no. 

700
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,380
It does not matter and ağa is unemployed. 

701
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,480
You will find better. I did not watch this woman.

702
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,760
Don't say that, Barlas. Good girl. 

703
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,740
Ece loves him very much. 

704
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,760
When things are like this, I don't want any other problems. Well. 

705
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,860
That's the thing. 

706
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,300
What did you do tonight Did your wife hit you? 

707
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,240
Barlas worse than hitting. 

708
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,920
What are you looking at? 

709
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,600
Won't you tell me which wife you took? 

710
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,900
What are you looking me? 

711
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,900
Nonsense, Barlas. 

712
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,140
Reports. 

713
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
Have. 

714
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,620
Where? 

715
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,300
I'm upset, I'm not talking to you. 

716
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,080
Where are you going? 

717
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,080
Leave it alone. 

718
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,520
Barlas. 

719
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,400
I swear it was super. Very cool. 

720
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,700
But you must take it by my arm and bring it ... 

721
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,419
... not so much ... 

722
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,960
... it didn't fit the big boss like you. 

723
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,120
Pray, I'm not mad. 

724
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,980
Don't confuse the words.

725
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,220
Look, I'm asking you for the last time. Why did you come? 

726
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,560
I came to talk to my father. 

727
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,980
What? 

728
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Joke. 

729
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,979
Murat called, so I came. 

730
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,580
He was going to tell me something. 

731
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,580
That I have to do? 

732
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,060
Look, you're trying to waste time, but it will be bad. 

733
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,779
Bahar explodes in you. 

734
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,980
Will my father yell at you? 

735
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,520
Do you think it will be like this? 

736
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,200
Actually, I saw my father in Murat's room. 

737
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,680
But I didn't say anything. Do not worry. 

738
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,060
I have no confusion. 

739
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,799
You are lying. 

740
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,776
My father does not come to work at this time of life. 

741
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,040
Is here. How can I know. 

742
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,020
Even let me get away. 

743
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,339
More than you can see. 

744
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,700
Now he sees something with you.

745
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,160
You suspect it well, right? 

746
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,740
As you can see my brother ... 

747
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,740
I still think about you. 

748
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,920
By the way, your room was really cool. 

749
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,980
The office chair is legendary. 

750
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,819
It fits you well. 

751
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,560
It would be a shame to take it off, right? 

752
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,279
We both don't want that. 

753
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,379
Sorry, well ... 

754
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,320
I guess I misspelled your name on the quote. 

755
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,900
What is the name? I do not leave the record incomplete. 

756
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,919
I didn't tell you my name, honey. 

757
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,759
But ... 

758
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,440
Onur Bey's dates ... 

759
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,819
I wasn't on a date with Onur Bey. 

760
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,816
As you can see, exactly ... 

761
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,680
... from here. We come together before your eyes. 

762
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,520
We went into the room together. But congratulations. 

763
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,960
It was not good, if not intelligent.

764
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,480
Who is this? 

765
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,420
Who is this girl? 

766
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,399
Is it order now, sugar? 

767
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,660
She is not a girl for us. Yasemin worries. 

768
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,360
You're right, honey, but ... 

769
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,880
... if we find the girl, maybe we'll squeeze her out. 

770
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,920
We will let him go after you. 

771
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,960
I don't know Aydan. No matter. 

772
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,740
I did stupid things. I'm already embarrassed. 

773
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,380
Okay, Yasemin, okay. He went away. 

774
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,660
Gone, okay. 

775
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,920
Let's look forward now, okay? 

776
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,399
You are very hurtful when you want it alone. Let me tell you that too. 

777
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,640
You're telling the truth, but I really got lost. 

778
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,060
You won't lose, darling. You will not do it. 

779
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,380
You have lost yourself, you lose the war. Next. 

780
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,140
It is clear that.

781
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,220
You couldn't handle the crisis, honey. 

782
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,980
You fell with crazy movements. 

783
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,480
You showed how weak your nerves are. 

784
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,540
No. He 

785
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,500
'll be calm ... 

786
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,319
... that he will follow his cunning plan ... 

787
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,840
... you yelled at the man. 

788
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,600
Also with us. 

789
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,440
I was very surprised, Yasemin. I've never seen you like this. 

790
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,560
Yes. I was in disgrace. 

791
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,640
Don't be ridiculous, Yasemin. Lift your head. 

792
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,259
Yasemin, look at me. 

793
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,640
Do you want this man? You do not want. 

794
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,220
I do not know. I swear I don't know. 

795
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,180
He says I don't know yet. He keeps thinking. 

796
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,940
It broke. 

797
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,740
Your marriage, Yasemin. 

798
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,859
Of course you want. 

799
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,620
So you have children, Yasemin. 

800
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,260
Yeah but I ... I 

801
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:58,640
really don't know what to do.

802
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,320
Look Yasemin. 

803
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,859
Open your ear, listen to me. 

804
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,100
Men do such things. 

805
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,060
They get someone as young or something. 

806
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,156
But they eventually return to their wives. 

807
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,180
Point. 

808
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,940
When we say young ... 

809
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,800
... that friend from Derin ... 

810
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,640
... would come in and out of your house. 

811
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,740
Don't let it be. 

812
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,920
Oh, Yasemin. 

813
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,140
Your work is very hard. 

814
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,500
His daughter is one year old. 

815
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,100
No, it's not. Not that. 

816
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,899
It's not that, don't be silly. It is not another. 

817
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:31,620
So Who? 

818
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,319
I don't know who exactly. Murat ... 

819
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:35,740
... phone on ... 

820
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,480
... when you get the message ... 

821
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,760
... Murat had to admit it. 

822
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,759
Oh who is it darling. 

823
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,160
Nobody, it doesn't matter. One of the girls is here.

824
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,180
God. 

825
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,280
Look Yasemin. 

826
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,120
Now with the right tactic ... 

827
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,480
You shake them all up. 

828
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,500
What are you doing? 

829
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,680
Peace with your husband in no time. 

830
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,860
Go to your water. Behave before work, honey. 

831
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,880
Well. 

832
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,060
I'll say something, really ... 

833
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,360
They know that Murat is cheating on me ... 

834
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,240
Is Yasemin the same again? 

835
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,420
The same again? You took it, honey. 

836
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,040
Who told you this? 

837
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,260
No one. 

838
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,420
Nobody, I think he was crazy. 

839
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,760
When we listen, we are in shock. Look, I swear. 

840
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,240
How do we know, sugar? 

841
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,480
But you were so sure ... 

842
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,120
... I even suspect myself, so sometime. 

843
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,860
Is your meeting over? 

844
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,900
Well done.

845
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,540
It is quite complicated here. 

846
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,600
My father officially opened the war, I'm dealing with it. 

847
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,220
Why is that? 

848
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,060
You don't want me to be in the company. 

849
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,600
Trying to slide my foot. 

850
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,660
Of course, I get even more ambitious when he attacks. No news. 

851
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,180
How is that? 

852
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,640
Well ... 

853
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,060
... the company will remain for you. You are not a stranger. 

854
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,879
Be it the long story, I'll tell you later. 

855
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,900
Where are you? 

856
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,899
I am by the sea. 

857
00:45:27,255 --> 00:45:28,585
Why aren't you in school? 

858
00:45:30,035 --> 00:45:31,615
Mine is a long story. 

859
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Did something happen Derin? 

860
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,900
Your hands again? 

861
00:45:35,425 --> 00:45:38,015
No worries, I'm fine. 

862
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,759
I'll tell you later. 

863
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,360
Okay, so the message has been received.

864
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,500
See you after work at night? 

865
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,220
Could be. 

866
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,880
Okay, I'll call you. 

867
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,480
I will see. 

868
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,419
Thanks Yasin. 

869
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,560
I think there is a Bahar sister party. 

870
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,339
I hope, Yasin. 

871
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,220
My daughter, are you kidding me? 

872
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,120
...Are you kidding me? 

873
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,640
What are you doing? 

874
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,879
I'm not kidding. What joke? 

875
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,320
What were you doing with Murat in the morning? 

876
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,200
You don't really understand the words. 

877
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,060
Don't move around me. Didn't I tell you? 

878
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,660
I am doing it too. 

879
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,160
Didn't you hear it with your ear? I came to say that I quit my job. 

880
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,120
I won't see you with Murat again. 

881
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,220
My beautiful girl I will not see her. 

882
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,819
That I have to do?

883
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,076
That I have to do? Should I disappear to the point where I stopped? 

884
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,860
I did it cleanly. 

885
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,560
Well. I'm not very curious about your work either. 

886
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,180
I do not come. Done. 

887
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:51,940
Done. 

888
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,680
God willing. 

889
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,640
Don't bring me here again. 

890
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,040
You understand. 

891
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,720
Don't ever bring me here again. 

892
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:19,435
You will pay. 

893
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,020
You will pay. 

894
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,620
Are you available? 

895
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,740
Yasemin ... 

896
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,600
... of course I'm available. Come. 

897
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,980
I said pass while you pass 

898
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,439
You did well, Yasemin. You take? 

899
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,260
I don't drink anything Murat. 

900
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,700
I thought ... 

901
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,320
Here you go. 

902
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,419
Because of my behavior last night ... 

903
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,080
... then ...

904
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,195
I am aware that it has exceeded its purpose. Look, I couldn't quite reach it ... 

905
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,200
... the difference. 

906
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,380
Because I am very angry. 

907
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,560
I acted like this. 

908
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:30,260
This is ... 

909
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,560
... this is not an excuse. I am aware of that as well. 

910
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:35,960
But ... 

911
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,419
I also lost my balance. 

912
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:43,020
Anyway, I accused you but ... 

913
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,160
I'm sorry. 

914
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,620
You are going to break. 

915
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,040
I am sorry. Two words. 

916
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,319
You will say that I am sorry. Yasemin will be finished. 

917
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,520
Why are you squirming? 

918
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,460
No. 

919
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:58,900
So ... 

920
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,140
I'm sorry, of course. 

921
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,600
Of course I am sorry. Then I was wrong. 

922
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,120
But ... 

923
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,500
... what is this? 

924
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,400
A telephone rings. 

925
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,380
From here. 

926
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,080
Mio is here.

927
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,720
There is a phone here. 

928
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,060
Mine is here but. 

929
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,840
It is from Barlas or Onur. 

930
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,759
Or Ruhi. 

931
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:31,740
Give. 

932
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,460
Murat, did I become Alzheimer's? 

933
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,300
I forgot my phone. 

934
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,320
Would you bring it to me at night? 

935
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,060
So, of course, it doesn't bother. 

936
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,820
You're going to have coffee, you know. 

937
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,560
I'm waiting for you. Hello? 

938
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,940
Murat didn't hear you, hi. 

939
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,720
Yasemin. 

940
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,240
I just sat here ... 

941
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,379
I'm trying to apologize to you, Murat. 

942
00:50:00,795 --> 00:50:02,915
Lo, maybe something ... 

943
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,080
... I'm trying to talk about how we can fix it. 

944
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,420
That girl was here. 

945
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,880
So all you say is brag. 

946
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,580
Bragging. What I said. 

947
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,879
You don't want to save our marriage, Murat. 

948
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,600
It's very obvious.

949
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:18,053
Where are you taking it from, Yasemin? 

950
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,160
Can we ever talk? 

951
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,060
I can not believe you. You are so selfish. 

952
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,419
So even say a situation ... 

953
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,140
Excuse me ... 

954
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,220
... you think I'm not you. 

955
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,740
No, curiously ... 

956
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,860
... you expect me to believe it too and ... 

957
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,140
... you make me believe it. 

958
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,560
I am sitting here with regret. 

959
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,940
I hate you so much now. 

960
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,920
Yasemin, you misunderstand everything. 

961
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,160
I can't stop here. 

962
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,020
Yasemin, he won't go. 

963
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,980
I ask you not to go to Bahar. 

964
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,400
One minute. 

965
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,260
What happened? 

966
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,980
Complain about me, what happened to your lover? 

967
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,940
Look at you, Yasemin. 

968
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,340
You cannot think correctly. Yasemin. 

969
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,339
Could you put down that phone?

970
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,820
Please don't disturb people. 

971
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,540
Please, we have no right to do this. 

972
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:17,540
No problem. 

973
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,340
Are you going to drop that? 

974
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,500
Have. 

975
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,940
You have a new one for your lover. 

976
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,880
We are talking to you very often these days, my dear Yasemin. 

977
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,680
The conversation with you is great. 

978
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:56,660
But I think I'm very busy right now. 

979
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,120
Are you continuing your relationship with Murat? 

980
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,580
You should ask no to me, Yasemin. 

981
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,700
I can not say anything. 

982
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,400
You said your friends had the news. 

983
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,560
Who knows? 

984
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:37,900
Everyone. 

985
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,220
All your friends. 

986
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,300
You are lying. 

987
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,380
Nobody knows. 

988
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,560
Ask them these questions, not me, Yasemin. 

989
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,800
But you can't ask, can you?

990
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,540
This is your whole problem. 

991
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,380
You cannot speak anything openly. 

992
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,020
No husband, no friends, no one. 

993
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,339
Is there any news from Derin? 

994
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:03,980
I do not believe it. 

995
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,459
The door stayed open, Bahar. 

996
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,860
Your phone is also off. Are you running out of charge? 

997
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:18,920
Mom, what are you doing here? 

998
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,920
I think ... 

999
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,220
Honey, he came to call me to work. 

1000
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:35,060
He made an offer that I can't refuse. I also confirmed it. 

1001
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,820
Isn't that right, Yasemin? 

1002
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:45,540
Yes, of course. 

1003
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,819
This is great news! That's all! 

1004
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,379
And they call you cruel, mom. 

1005
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,220
You are a wonderful person. I'm so happy. 

1006
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,240
Yes. Anyway, I'll go. 

1007
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,440
There is a lot of work. I will see. 

1008
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,340
Of course. 

1009
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:06,820
Goodbye.

1010
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,060
See you tomorrow. 

1011
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,540
I'm not too late. 

1012
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,380
We will talk in the afternoon. 

1013
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:18,940
I'm so happy. 

1014
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,760
I have something to tell you. 

1015
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,100
Honey, close the door. 

1016
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,160
What are you saying? They tightened up nicely after you left. 

1017
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,220
I hope you didn't say that. 

1018
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,460
Can you say, will I tell you Murat? 

1019
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,440
But I mean, cold sweat didn't flow down my back. 

1020
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,980
Sitare is also a friend. It keeps coming to me. 

1021
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,700
On the one hand Aydan. No ... 

1022
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,480
... all apart ... 

1023
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,820
... my explosion for Yasemin. 

1024
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,040
If Yasemin finds out ... 

1025
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,500
... I can't look at his face embarrassed. 

1026
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,800
I think he heard you. Looking for him. 

1027
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,000
Let me come out and talk. 

1028
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,360
No need to open the phone.

1029
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,560
I can't handle another fight now. 

1030
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,220
The girl is going to be very angry. 

1031
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,980
After what happened this morning ... 

1032
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,820
... she can't be angry anymore. Do not worry. 

1033
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,560
Damn! 

1034
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:51,980
Damn! 

1035
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,540
God damn you! 

1036
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,080
Damn! God ... 

1037
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,740
damn it! God damn you all ... 

1038
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,740
... Damn. 

1039
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,080
I would appreciate if you call when appropriate. Important. 

1040
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,440
A lot of. 

1041
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:35,740
Calm down. 

1042
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,220
Relax, relax. 

1043
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,200
The coffees have arrived. 

1044
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,080
I'm listening. 

1045
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,580
I made my decision. I leave the school. 

1046
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:00,020
So I will never go there again. 

1047
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,899
You were right. Now I have to show that I am growing. 

1048
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:07,140
Life is mine and I make the decisions. 

1049
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:09,480
You're super.

1050
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:13,299
So did you think what to do? 

1051
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:14,780
I do not know. 

1052
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,140
So I don't know yet. 

1053
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,240
But there is something I know. I definitely don't want to be a pianist. 

1054
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,759
Then maybe I'll be a waitress for a while. 

1055
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,240
If I were you ... 

1056
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,420
... I would make this decision immediately tonight. 

1057
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:30,880
I'm home tomorrow. 

1058
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:33,100
I will support you. I will stand behind you. 

1059
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,940
Don't delay, don't give up. 

1060
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:35,920
So ... 

1061
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,600
... the later I say it will be more difficult ... 

1062
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,600
... isn't it? 

1063
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,760
Exactly. 

1064
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:44,000
I think tonight is delicious for this news. 

1065
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,120
This is the situation. 

1066
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,500
Brother Murat. 

1067
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,359
Welcome brother Ruhi. 

1068
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,520
Hello everybody. 

1069
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,020
Which client did my father go to? 

1070
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,600
He told you for sure.

1071
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,560
Sorry guys, I stepped in but ... 

1072
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,300
Excuse me. Murat to see you. 

1073
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:18,980
Say hi to your dad. 

1074
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,440
I'll say it if I find it. 

1075
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,880
I don't know, Onur. 

1076
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,439
He came to my office ... 

1077
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,320
... said he would go to the client, but which one ... 

1078
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,340
... I don't remember. He said, but I don't remember. 

1079
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:31,920
If there's anything, tell me I'll help you. 

1080
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,440
No brother asked. So. 

1081
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,220
Hello everybody. 

1082
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,360
Welcome Aunt Yasemin. 

1083
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:41,940
I hope I didn't break it. 

1084
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,540
No no no, come on. 

1085
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:45,900
I have some jobs. 

1086
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,880
Excuse me. 

1087
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,340
You are welcome, brother. 

1088
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:55,940
Here you have. 

1089
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,580
No, I will not sit. 

1090
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,680
Why don't you pick up your phone? 

1091
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,060
I do not want to fight with you. That's why.

1092
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:06,720
We are not going. Why did you come? Which is the topic. Tell me. 

1093
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,200
The theme is the same. 

1094
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,940
The subject is Bahar. This Bahar ... 

1095
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,100
... we have problems for you, Murat. Well. 

1096
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,220
To go home again ... 

1097
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,240
... he threatened me along with Derin. 

1098
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,440
She will come home tomorrow. 

1099
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:26,940
Can you understand what I am saying? 

1100
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:31,480
I don't know, maybe you would be much happier. 

1101
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,820
So you can gather much more comfortably. 

1102
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,419
Wait a minute, a minute, I didn't understand anything. 

1103
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,200
How did he threaten you? 

1104
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,200
Where did you see Bahar? 

1105
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:43,920
I went to Bahar. 

1106
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:44,560
You went. 

1107
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,220
Yes, I went to Bahar. 

1108
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,340
Yasemin. 

1109
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,600
That's not the point, Murat. 

1110
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,120
You will understand if you listen to me. 

1111
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:57,960
While I was there, Derin came to Bahar's house. Well?

1112
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,140
Of course he didn't know what to say. 

1113
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,100
And Bahar, just to leave me in trouble ... 

1114
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,240
Your mother came to call me to get back to work, she said. 

1115
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,400
Good to Derin. 

1116
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:12,020
Can you take a look at the trap he dropped me, Murat? 

1117
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:15,740
If I said no, I would say everything. To Derin. 

1118
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:16,980
I was going to tell Derin. 

1119
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,000
Not know what to do. 

1120
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,220
Had to say yes. So as a result. 

1121
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,140
Look, that girl is a demon Murat. 

1122
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,220
Yasemin. 

1123
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,340
You went there on your own foot. 

1124
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,820
Didn't we talk to you? 

1125
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:34,020
Didn't I tell you not to go, Yasemin? Why are you going? 

1126
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,780
Why do you face a girl in two? 

1127
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,400
The ones between you and me have nothing to do with it. 

1128
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,600
No. 

1129
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,279
I can't believe.

1130
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,160
I can not believe that? 

1131
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,859
I can't believe Murat, he's great. 

1132
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,400
So beautiful. This little devil ... 

1133
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,540
... can do whatever he wants. But after all ... 

1134
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,460
... Yasemin will be charged again. 

1135
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,600
It is this? Is that so? 

1136
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,380
Amazing. You are so noble, Murat ... 

1137
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,759
... you are protecting your love right now and your wife ... 

1138
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,340
... you throw him off the cliff. Bravo. 

1139
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:02,780
What does it have to do with it? 

1140
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:05,240
What you have to do? 

1141
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,940
Why did you go there? I am asking you a clear question. 

1142
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:08,700
Why ... 

1143
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:09,960
... did you go? 

1144
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:11,660
Because ... 

1145
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,160
... in my husband's office ... 

1146
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,776
... he's reckless enough to put down his phone ... 

1147
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,200
I wanted to go and ask him.

1148
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,799
What Yasemin? Complete your sentence. 

1149
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,320
What did you want to ask? 

1150
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,100
I can not do it. 

1151
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,680
I can not do it. 

1152
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,740
What Derin? Are you okay? 

1153
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,220
I'm good. You? 

1154
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:45,160
What happened? 

1155
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,080
Nothing. 

1156
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:48,660
I said, let me take a look when my work clears up. 

1157
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,180
How are the situations at home? 

1158
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,419
I mean, we have a little fight with my mother but ... 

1159
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,879
... that's normal to look at. 

1160
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,140
What happened? 

1161
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,360
Nothing nothing. I was just asking. 

1162
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,040
Onur, while calling ... 

1163
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,160
... or ... 

1164
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,616
... I know we have contracted, but with my parents at night ... 

1165
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:06,640
I have to eat. 

1166
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,680
If we do it later, will it? 

1167
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,080
Of course. 

1168
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,300
It gets even better. Because me too ...

1169
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,160
I have a dinner plan with ours. 

1170
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:17,180
Long story. So you say we'll talk later. 

1171
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,420
Yes. 

1172
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,020
As soon as possible. 

1173
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,560
Well. I will see. 

1174
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,100
Welcome. 

1175
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:18,140
Thanks. 

1176
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:21,060
I am sorry. 

1177
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,200
You've been in trouble, right? 

1178
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,740
But what should I do? I never realized that I dropped the phone. 

1179
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,020
I left you in a difficult situation. 

1180
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,680
Something. 

1181
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,920
I do not worry. 

1182
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,080
The phone. 

1183
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:40,360
But this. 

1184
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,820
Yours is not in use. 

1185
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:45,940
Yasemin? 

1186
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:50,540
I already guessed it. He was very angry when he came to me. 

1187
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:54,140
Fortunately, she broke the phone, not me. 

1188
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,360
Yasemin, Bahar is out of control. 

1189
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,920
It is unclear where the tramp will explode like a mine.

1190
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:03,540
Anyway. 

1191
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,480
Come on. 

1192
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,240
Don't let me come. What happens. 

1193
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,800
One coffee, five minutes. 

1194
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,540
I promise I'll fire you for the sixth minute, really. 

1195
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,260
A coffee. 

1196
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:29,440
You sit. I fill the cafes and come. 

1197
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,060
Thanks. 

1198
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,680
Enjoy your meal. 

1199
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:13,240
Know your worth. Latest. 

1200
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,060
If it's the last one, stay with you. 

1201
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:21,319
You need more today. 

1202
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,680
You are right. 

1203
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,600
Are you not going to ask anything? 

1204
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,140
No. 

1205
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,620
We are both very tired. 

1206
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:34,940
They both know it. 

1207
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:36,819
I promised that I would wait. 

1208
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,460
Then there is no doubt. 

1209
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,460
No wonder if I run out of it. 

1210
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:46,420
You will come to us tomorrow. 

1211
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,220
Oh yeah. 

1212
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,520
Derin ... 

1213
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:52,520
... As soon as Yasemin screamed, I was surprised what to say.

1214
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:54,580
It just came out of my mouth. 

1215
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,700
No, he looked like an idol in Yasemin. The pause. 

1216
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,320
Thanks. 

1217
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:03,700
It was a ridiculous situation. 

1218
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:07,600
But I'll handle it. 

1219
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:10,200
So a day or two without hitting the girls like that. 

1220
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,320
With an excuse, lick it again, don't worry. 

1221
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:14,460
Nice ... 

1222
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:16,779
... Yasemin didn't kill me tomorrow. 

1223
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,620
Yasemin ... 

1224
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,540
... says she did it to put him in a difficult situation. 

1225
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:24,820
You got it trapped. 

1226
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:26,100
What? 

1227
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:28,720
That is good. 

1228
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,900
I'm the one in trouble. 

1229
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,200
When it comes to Derin ... 

1230
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,279
... Derin ... 

1231
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,840
... what would I do when my mom said what are you doing here? 

1232
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:39,040
I said the first thing that came to mind. 

1233
01:06:39,465 --> 01:06:42,575
No, the weather is nice for me. I say the truth.

1234
01:06:42,955 --> 01:06:44,465
She is the one hiding. 

1235
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,120
Because of this, he was in a difficult situation. 

1236
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,319
I fell into a false state. 

1237
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,960
Just because I'm going to save him. 

1238
01:06:50,925 --> 01:06:51,985
Well well. 

1239
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:54,345
You are right. Well. 

1240
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,379
But come tell this to Yasemin. 

1241
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,200
Really ... 

1242
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:03,380
... I don't want to say anything bad anyway. 

1243
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,500
Or I want to say it. 

1244
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:07,720
I swear. 

1245
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,900
I mean ungrateful. Ungrateful. 

1246
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:20,820
Yes doughter? 

1247
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,020
Hello Dad. Where are you? 

1248
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,520
I'm out, dear, did something happen? 

1249
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:29,020
I waited for you to set the table, I said, let me know. 

1250
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:31,920
Okay, okay. 

1251
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:33,279
You begin. 

1252
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,360
I will catch up. I will arrive a little late. 

1253
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,100
See you later, my daughter. 

1254
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,694
I couldn't have my coffee either. I have to go. 

1255
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Do not go.

1256
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,340
Stay here. 

1257
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:52,920
I can not jump. I can not do it. 

1258
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,460
Actually, the truth is Bahar ... 

1259
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,859
... I'd rather stay with you here. 

1260
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,399
But I can't do this to you. 

1261
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,600
I can not do it. 

1262
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:21,380
Murat. 

1263
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:28,880
I know. 

1264
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,040
If we only hug once. 

1265
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:40,100
One time. 

1266
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,840
See you later. 

1267
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,640
Excuse me. 

1268
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:07,600
To the most beautiful woman in the world. 

1269
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,340
Thanks Barlas. 

1270
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:21,780
No one can afford it like you, darling. 

1271
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:23,500
Sitoş can't understand it. 

1272
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:30,780
Hi dear. 

1273
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:31,820
We found it good, mom. 

1274
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:34,680
A drink before eating. 

1275
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:37,060
Let's prepare your father. The closure is very beautiful. 

1276
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,520
No, I'm not taking it, Mom. 

1277
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:39,400
Today the company ...

1278
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,960
... it was pretty intense. If I drink it now, I love it without eating. 

1279
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:43,960
And Onur Bey ... 

1280
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,920
business world ... 

1281
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,980
... is not like studying in private schools. 

1282
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:51,880
My sugar gets used to that. If you help too ... 

1283
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,220
... learn the job. It is not? 

1284
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,080
I know ... 

1285
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,440
Onur Efendi. 

1286
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:58,940
From his father ... 

1287
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,259
... he won't help you. 

1288
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,360
...in my opinion. 

1289
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,520
No dad. 

1290
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,040
Actually, I needed your help on an issue today ... 

1291
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:08,580
... I couldn't find you. 

1292
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,400
If you went to Murat, my partner. 

1293
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,440
If you go to brother Murat. 

1294
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:12,520
I went, I went. 

1295
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,480
Aunt Yasemin also came. 

1296
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,139
He was in no condition to speak. 

1297
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,820
I asked him where he was. Said it went to the customer. 

1298
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:20,340
Which one did I say?

1299
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,640
The head of a man of the world. He couldn't answer me. 

1300
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,680
What client did you go to, dad? 

1301
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:27,660
You will know if I say it. 

1302
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,019
I also worked on this issue. 

1303
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,759
I examined all the clients one by one all day. 

1304
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,780
Well, we need to know who we work with, right? 

1305
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,500
Look how beautiful. You learn it like this. It is bad? 

1306
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,280
You still haven't told me who you're going to. 

1307
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:44,760
Are you boiling? 

1308
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,259
What will I boil? I went to Kemal. 

1309
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:49,060
To Kemal Bey, Kemal Gürses. 

1310
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:50,340
You know? 

1311
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:52,500
Kemal. 

1312
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,080
I didn't read such a name, dad. 

1313
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,960
So you have to work harder. You saw it? 

1314
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:58,240
If you look at the letter K. 

1315
01:11:58,760 --> 01:11:59,920
Kamuran, Kamil, Kemal. 

1316
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,140
You will call, you will find. 

1317
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:02,180
Are both ...

1318
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,719
... where did you get this love for the customer? 

1319
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,520
I think we are curious. 

1320
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,860
No. I just want to deal with clients. All this. 

1321
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:11,280
Let me take the load off your shoulder. It is not? 

1322
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:14,860
At the beginning of this, my son. First you get the inside of the company. 

1323
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:15,920
Dominate there. 

1324
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,200
Then chase customers outside. 

1325
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,720
Then. There is more time for him. 

1326
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:21,580
Okay, let's go. 

1327
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,720
Let's get ready to eat. Here you have. 

1328
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,620
Go. 

1329
01:12:28,035 --> 01:12:30,285
Dad, look what I'm going to say. 

1330
01:12:31,655 --> 01:12:33,844
I think this is the right decision for the client's business. 

1331
01:12:33,845 --> 01:12:35,355
Let's ask my grandfather. 

1332
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:37,220
We understand. 

1333
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,500
Great place torpedin, great boss. 

1334
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:43,120
But do not forget. I'm not a kettle, son. 

1335
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:46,040
Just enough sugar.

1336
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,840
The job remained with the company. 

1337
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,376
Working at dinner, with the client ... 

1338
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,379
... on the file ... 

1339
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:52,380
I don't want to hear a word. Well? 

1340
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,140
It's fine? 

1341
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:56,280
Okay, okay. 

1342
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:57,900
What's for dinner? 

1343
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Mom ... 

1344
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:07,860
... my baby Bahar ... 

1345
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:09,640
Do you know where? 

1346
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:13,000
Today I searched with Aunt Filiz but I couldn't find him. 

1347
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:18,400
I have not seen one. Get it out of a place. 

1348
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,100
But I was going to play with it. 

1349
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,520
You have a lot of babies, my dear. You play with them. 

1350
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,700
How are we going to deal with food now? 

1351
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:28,940
I do not want. 

1352
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:30,380
I want baby Bahar. 

1353
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,180
I love her very much. 

1354
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,440
Let's call. 

1355
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:38,339
Not before you finish your meal. 

1356
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,120
How is school going? 

1357
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:47,360
Well. My mom.

1358
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,180
School is like always. 

1359
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,480
Dad, why didn't you come yet? 

1360
01:13:52,275 --> 01:13:54,695
The income was now at work. What happened? 

1361
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,360
Do you have a job with your father? 

1362
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,940
Dad, my dad came. 

1363
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:03,219
I came, my dear. 

1364
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:08,260
Welcome. 

1365
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:08,820
Hello. 

1366
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:09,599
Welcome dad. 

1367
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,600
Hello. 

1368
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:15,175
My only. 

1369
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:16,220
Welcome father. 

1370
01:14:16,225 --> 01:14:18,715
Thanks. You are not in your fire, I hope. 

1371
01:14:19,765 --> 01:14:21,035
Oh. My beautiful daughter. 

1372
01:14:22,275 --> 01:14:24,375
Enjoy your meal. Hi Yasemin. 

1373
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:26,020
Hello. 

1374
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:28,180
I can't find my baby Bahar. 

1375
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:30,400
Do we look for it together? 

1376
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:32,400
Well, daughter. 

1377
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:34,940
But first, let's eat our food. It's okay? 

1378
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,180
Do you drink soup? 

1379
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,179
I go. Let me wash my hands. 

1380
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:02,500
Sitare doesn't open his knife.

1381
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,780
There is nothing new? Conspiracy theory. 

1382
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:07,120
Gossip. 

1383
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,900
Nothing different, honey. What they know. 

1384
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:11,660
Didn't Yasemin say anything? 

1385
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:14,080
What the hell do you want, Barlas? 

1386
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,080
I call it reserved, sugar, discreet. 

1387
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:18,700
I also squeezed Murat. He said nothing. 

1388
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:19,780
He is blessed as a spy. 

1389
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:21,980
What's going on? 

1390
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:24,140
Son, you don't know about the world. 

1391
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,940
It is a great scandal. 

1392
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,960
Brother Murat is playing with Aunt Yasemin. 

1393
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:31,800
Wait a minute. 

1394
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,760
We are eating and Aunt Yasemin was screaming. 

1395
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,920
There is misfortune, great misfortune. 

1396
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,640
You're exaggerating, Barlas. 

1397
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:41,880
What am I exaggerating? 

1398
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:43,500
What am I exaggerating? Didn't that happen? 

1399
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:49,120
No, tell me if you know something. If a man's head burns ...

1400
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,240
... the tip touches us. 

1401
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,800
That's why I say, if not ... 

1402
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,700
... what will I care? He does what he wants. 

1403
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:57,379
You probably don't think I'll buy those numbers, honey. 

1404
01:15:58,140 --> 01:15:59,920
Son, I'll train you to deal with me. 

1405
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:04,040
Brother Murat dealing with his burned head. 

1406
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:05,280
Go deal with it. 

1407
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:06,800
Let's not have a goal there. 

1408
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,840
It's beautiful, Yasemin. Health to your hands. 

1409
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:14,920
Enjoy your meal. 

1410
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,880
I did it however you want, without frying. 

1411
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,480
Thanks. 

1412
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:22,820
How was your day? 

1413
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,500
Not bad. 

1414
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,840
My day was also very good. 

1415
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:28,760
Because my sister Bahar is coming tomorrow. 

1416
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,160
Mom ... 

1417
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,280
... wanted bread. You can bring? 

1418
01:16:42,485 --> 01:16:44,755
Bread for you, sweet for you. 

1419
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:08,420
Forgiveness. 

1420
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,139
I spoke to Bahar, Yasemin.

1421
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:16,220
It will keep coming and going for a few days. 

1422
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:19,240
So that Derin doesn't suspect something. Then you will find an excuse. 

1423
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:20,660
He will get off work. 

1424
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,780
Does it seem reasonable to you? 

1425
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,540
It doesn't really seem reasonable to me. 

1426
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,060
I tell everything and ... 

1427
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:29,740
... It seems reasonable to me to put an end to these antics. 

1428
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,339
Don't worry Derin. Let's go inside. 

1429
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,840
Are you going to open the door? 

1430
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,219
Sorry Sorry. A cup fell. There is nothing. 

1431
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:51,220
Come. 

1432
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:52,280
Well. Not important. 

1433
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:54,900
Take it, honey. 

1434
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:11,340
I have to tell you something. 

1435
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:12,940
Tell me dear. 

1436
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:17,059
I left school. 

1437
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:18,980
What? 

1438
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,360
What does that mean? What happened Girl? Why are you leaving school? 

1439
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,820
Did something happen, dear? 

1440
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,600
Derin'cig. 

1441
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,780
I am sorry.

1442
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,179
This will never happen. 

1443
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:33,700
I never allow it. 

1444
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:34,780
My mom ... 

1445
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:37,540
... I don't want your permission anyway, I say my ... 

1446
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:38,540
... decision. 

1447
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,780
Well my daughter. But why? Can you tell me why? 

1448
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:45,900
Daddy, I don't want to go to school anymore. 

1449
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:48,200
Okay, why girl? You say something serious. 

1450
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:49,620
Why? 

1451
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,480
There is no yelling at the table. 

1452
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:54,760
You are quite right, my dear. 

1453
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:57,600
Derin'cig ... 

1454
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:00,975
... sorry. What you say will not happen. 

1455
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:02,599
It's not possible. 

1456
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:03,240
The topic has been closed. 

1457
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,440
The subject was not closed. 

1458
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,200
Derin. 

1459
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:06,580
Yasemin. 

1460
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:08,540
Can we talk about this later? 

1461
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,980
What are we going to talk about? There is nothing to talk about. 

1462
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,800
What do you mean by nothing to talk about?

1463
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,240
This means that you will not say, Derin'ci. 

1464
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:16,760
Everything. 

1465
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,100
Dessert. 

1466
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,480
Dessert? 

1467
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:21,580
Mom, aren't you listening to me? 

1468
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:23,420
Or do you not want to understand? 

1469
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:26,059
I'm trying to explain a decision to you here. 

1470
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:28,960
I say I won't go to school either. You understand? 

1471
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,960
Done. I don't go to school or something like that. 

1472
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,400
I am not a child now I understand this. 

1473
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:34,080
I am tired of your behavior. 

1474
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:35,660
My daughter. 

1475
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:36,660
Please, dad. 

1476
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:43,760
Did my sister get into mischief, Mom? 

1477
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:46,620
Something like that happened, honey. 

1478
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:49,720
In other words, without speaking, listening ... 

1479
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,200
... why did you do it again? 

1480
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:53,720
Again. 

1481
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:15,339
What am I going to listen to this nonsense? 

1482
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:16,480
Can you tell me? 

1483
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:20,780
So I can't believe it.

1484
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:23,300
Five months to finish school. 

1485
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:25,700
Are we going to let him throw his years away? 

1486
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,696
We will not overlook Yasemin. Of course, let's not overlook. 

1487
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,180
But why do you want this? Let's try to understand it. 

1488
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,500
We knew that if you don't make it to the door. 

1489
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:35,860
In the middle of the night 

1490
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:38,780
I'm curious about that too. Wherever he went ... 

1491
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:40,680
Well, I guess, of course. 

1492
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:42,140
Where did she go ... 

1493
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:43,500
All these exploits ... 

1494
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:45,980
... because she was a prophet after meeting Bahar. 

1495
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:48,800
So did the word get out? 

1496
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,900
Did he turn around and go back to Bahar? 

1497
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:54,480
He turned around and got there. Because ... 

1498
01:20:54,485 --> 01:20:55,679
... Derin went to Bahar today. 

1499
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:57,200
He went to Bahar. 

1500
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,340
Then he came home and said he dropped out of school.

1501
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:03,095
What that demon did to get back home ... 

1502
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,520
I'm not even saying. 

1503
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,320
Yasemin. 

1504
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:07,500
Yasemin. 

1505
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:09,500
Can you be sick? 

1506
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:10,780
I'm going crazy. 

1507
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,800
I wonder, once. 

1508
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:14,220
Just once. 

1509
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:16,420
Do you think I have a chance to be right? 

1510
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:18,360
One time. 

1511
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:19,680
Just once. 

1512
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:21,900
You are always right, Yasemin. 

1513
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:23,240
All the time. 

1514
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:26,220
You are always right. 

1515
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:27,600
Don't yell at mom. 

1516
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:29,740
I don't scream, daughter. 

1517
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:31,740
I'm not yelling at myself. 

1518
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,139
Your father was joking ... 

1519
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:34,740
... my lamb. We were playing games. 

1520
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,840
Your father was joking. I'm one. Come. 

1521
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,120
My daughter is not screaming. Do not worry dear. 

1522
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,620
Bahar, if Derin calls, can you inform me?

1523
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,720
It means that the apocalypse is broken. 

1524
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:08,200
Handsome. 

1525
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:10,920
This will distract you a bit, Ms. Yasemin. 

1526
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:17,020
Of course. 

1527
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:18,620
Is there a problem? 

1528
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,040
Hello. 

1529
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:23,300
What is it? 

1530
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,860
Derin left the house and left. 

1531
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,460
We had a little fight. 

1532
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:27,680
Why is that? 

1533
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,060
I'll tell you Bahar. Then I'll tell it. Long story. 

1534
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:32,080
Alone, can you tell me if it comes to you? 

1535
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:33,040
Of course. 

1536
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:34,640
I must notify it. 

1537
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,080
If you want, I'll call you and find out where it is. 

1538
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:38,780
No no no no. 

1539
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,880
Now you understand what we are looking for. Everything becomes more complicated. 

1540
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:43,600
If you come, give him the news. Thanks. 

1541
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:44,680
Well. 

1542
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:45,900
Not important. 

1543
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,520
So ... 

1544
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,120
... if it's about me, if you call ...

1545
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,496
... I'll definitely let you know. 

1546
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,140
Well. 

1547
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:53,020
Well. Thanks. Thanks. 

1548
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,160
Murat. 

1549
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:58,080
If you get news, please let me know, okay? 

1550
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,920
Well well. I will see. 

1551
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:01,880
I will see. 

1552
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:22,080
Where did you stay I froze. 

1553
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,700
Take it. Why did you come out like this? What happened? 

1554
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:32,340
I left school. 

1555
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,420
I told my mom at night. 

1556
01:23:35,425 --> 01:23:38,035
My mother started talking foolishly at that moment. 

1557
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,480
No, I do not allow it. 

1558
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:42,840
I am trying to explain something there. 

1559
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,840
He tells my father if he wants dessert. 

1560
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:46,100
The woman has no respect for a gram. 

1561
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,900
Or one gram has led me to a fortress. 

1562
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:52,775
Well, bravo, well done, I say you did well ... 

1563
01:23:52,775 --> 01:23:53,856
... of course I don't wait.

1564
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,740
But he doesn't even listen to me. He does not listen. 

1565
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,736
She acts like I'm not there. 

1566
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:58,876
Okay, then let's do it like this ... 

1567
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:00,700
Let me notify your mother. Do not worry. 

1568
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:02,980
No. You are not looking for my mother Onur. 

1569
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:04,540
I no longer have anybody in mind. 

1570
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,800
Especially that woman. 

1571
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,080
I don't want a permit or something. 

1572
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:08,820
Do not be silly. 

1573
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:11,216
I didn't say we got permission anyway. 

1574
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:12,960
Let us notify. I said don't worry. 

1575
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,080
Would you be calm? 

1576
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:18,880
Please ok. 

1577
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:23,900
Derin is with me, don't worry. 

1578
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:25,740
I will leave her safely at her home. 

1579
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,639
Okay now ... 

1580
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:31,700
... let's go to a better place. 

1581
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,880
Let's discuss this great decision. 

1582
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,120
Well. 

1583
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:51,460
Derin reported.

1584
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:53,840
I was with a friend. 

1585
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:55,760
So it's good. He gave notice. 

1586
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:57,820
Ece how? 

1587
01:24:58,220 --> 01:24:59,220
Asleep 

1588
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:02,940
I am there then. 

1589
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:04,400
I'll take Ece then. 

1590
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,820
No, it is not necessary. 

1591
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:10,420
Yasemin. 

1592
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:13,220
Are you okay? 

1593
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:14,780
I'm good. 

1594
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:17,060
Well. 

1595
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:43,420
Yes. 

1596
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:46,900
I am listening to you. 

1597
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:49,840
There is not much to tell. 

1598
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:53,620
It was not exactly like that. 

1599
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:00,980
I left school. 

1600
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,520
I mentioned it to my mother at dinner. 

1601
01:26:05,525 --> 01:26:07,915
But they both fell on me. 

1602
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:11,139
Nice, I can't eat my father's right. I wonder why. 

1603
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:12,860
But my mother ... 

1604
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:16,680
... said the topic is closed and clicked all the words in my mouth. 

1605
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:19,360
Why am I surprised? 

1606
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,360
Here's my regular mom.

1607
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,740
No, to make my own decisions ... 

1608
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,660
... he never allows it. 

1609
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:28,920
Why is that? 

1610
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:30,260
What? Why? 

1611
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:32,220
So why do you want to quit school? 

1612
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:38,140
Because I don't feel like I belong there. 

1613
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:41,200
I don't want to be a pianist or something like that. 

1614
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,560
Well. 

1615
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:45,040
I understand you. 

1616
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,059
But look, that's half a period left. 

1617
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:49,640
Then school is over. 

1618
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:52,440
Wouldn't it be a bit silly if you quit now? 

1619
01:26:53,055 --> 01:26:55,275
The year you read so much will be wasted. 

1620
01:26:56,075 --> 01:26:58,965
These are just the words of Yasemin Düdenli. 

1621
01:27:00,225 --> 01:27:01,675
Well, Onur. 

1622
01:27:03,015 --> 01:27:05,005
What I feel? 

1623
01:27:05,225 --> 01:27:07,695
Do you think they don't matter? 

1624
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:08,840
Of course there is. 

1625
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,600
But your school .. 

1626
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,940
OK, let me ask you then.

1627
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:16,960
What do you want to do after school is over? 

1628
01:27:17,225 --> 01:27:19,185
So what do you really want to do? 

1629
01:27:20,625 --> 01:27:21,625
I do not know. 

1630
01:27:22,715 --> 01:27:25,485
We thought she might be a waitress for a while. 

1631
01:27:27,675 --> 01:27:28,675
We think. 

1632
01:27:31,025 --> 01:27:32,285
Who did you think with? 

1633
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:36,065
I was going to say I thought. 

1634
01:27:37,385 --> 01:27:39,475
You thought with Bahar, right? 

1635
01:27:39,475 --> 01:27:41,585
Onur, I just checked. 

1636
01:27:42,295 --> 01:27:43,695
God. 

1637
01:27:44,335 --> 01:27:46,645
Let Bahar draw his own life first. 

1638
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:48,965
Then he comes to advise you. 

1639
01:27:50,495 --> 01:27:51,715
Waitress. 

1640
01:27:52,135 --> 01:27:53,785
What do you understand as a waitress? 

1641
01:27:55,045 --> 01:27:56,045
Thanks. 

1642
01:27:56,695 --> 01:27:59,285
Thanks. Because you trusted me so much. 

1643
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:01,900
You're all the same, right? 

1644
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:03,780
I did not mean that. 

1645
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:05,620
But you said it. 

1646
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:08,900
Where are you going, Derin? Stop. 

1647
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:09,960
Onur ... 

1648
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,420
... if I wanted to make this speech ...

1649
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:13,420
... I would talk to my mother at home. 

1650
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:18,780
Don't come after me. 

1651
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:19,840
Derin. 

1652
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:37,300
Dear. 

1653
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:38,240
What's up mom 

1654
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:39,440
Well. 

1655
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:42,639
I think you were late at night, I didn't hear you. 

1656
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:45,080
Enough, enough. 

1657
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:48,380
He is holding a coffee in two. Sugar flutter. 

1658
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,220
I was a little late. Yes. 

1659
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:52,920
Nothing bad, Onur? 

1660
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,160
Like what? 

1661
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,480
What do i need to know? 

1662
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:58,019
Suddenly the phone came. I'm asking you out. 

1663
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,120
Nerd. I met a friend, mom. 

1664
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:04,260
How is that friend? 

1665
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:10,400
Mommy. 

1666
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:15,140
I'm asking if I can prepare, dear. What is wrong with that? 

1667
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,480
What type of preparation are we talking about? 

1668
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:21,980
Depression with Derin. 

1669
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:25,880
Why is that?

1670
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:28,420
Because I'll be old that second. 

1671
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:29,960
A complete disgrace. 

1672
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:31,240
Next. 

1673
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:35,360
Mom, you look great. Don't worry about them at all. 

1674
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:48,740
It's not what you look like. 

1675
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:50,180
Who are you? 

1676
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:52,640
The moment I was in the mother-in-law ... 

1677
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,060
... will be the moment I finish. 

1678
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,160
Because when it's valid ... 

1679
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,160
... something old automatically. 

1680
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:02,879
I will be ten years old at a time. 

1681
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:05,940
Do not laugh. 

1682
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:08,880
And can you believe it? 

1683
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,320
No doctor can cure this, my sugar. Next. 

1684
01:30:12,925 --> 01:30:13,925
Laughter. 

1685
01:30:22,645 --> 01:30:24,895
Look at me, you laugh, but that's what's going to happen. 

1686
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:26,580
Because of this ... 

1687
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,759
... just because of my nerves ... 

1688
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:34,679
... note that something lousy will be validated. 

1689
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:36,600
Look what I'm going to say. 

1690
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,600
In my opinion...

1691
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:40,380
... you are in the world ... 

1692
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:42,120
... the most beautiful. 

1693
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,360
But of course you have more, you have a little more time. 

1694
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:48,320
Have more? 

1695
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,360
That's. 

1696
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:53,360
That's all. Onur, I love you so much baby. 

1697
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,160
I love you very much. That's. I think there is more. 

1698
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,720
There is more time. I agree. 

1699
01:30:58,020 --> 01:30:59,060
There is no need, dear. 

1700
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,680
Of course. There is more. Then there is more. 

1701
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:02,940
Whenever you want? 

1702
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,120
I agree. 

1703
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:05,540
We are like friends with you. 

1704
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:06,140
Yes. 

1705
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:06,700
Isn't it? 

1706
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:07,700
What you say. 

1707
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:14,720
Mrs. Filiz will come to Ece every fifteen minutes. 

1708
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:16,519
Pay attention to that. 

1709
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:20,060
...runny nose. Sometimes we miss him. 

1710
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:21,840
What happens. It's okay? 

1711
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:24,240
So if something urgent happens, please call. 

1712
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:24,940
Well.

1713
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:25,780
OKAY. Wait if you want. 

1714
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:27,639
If it is fifteen minutes. 

1715
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,440
Here if I don't hurry. 

1716
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,440
You know. 

1717
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:31,260
Let me use this. 

1718
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:32,540
Let me help. 

1719
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:33,840
Well well. It was. 

1720
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,820
In his room, Derin. 

1721
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,200
Receive your news. 

1722
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,200
OK Do not worry. I'll let myself know if something happens. 

1723
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:42,360
It happened, Mrs. Filiz. Thank you. 

1724
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:43,360
Don't leave your eyes behind. 

1725
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:44,620
Well. 

1726
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:49,580
Brother Murat. 

1727
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:52,680
I know. 

1728
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,080
You came for the pay table. 

1729
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,680
I will send it to you shortly. Do not worry. 

1730
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,960
There isn't, brother. Actually, I didn't come for him. 

1731
01:32:58,295 --> 01:32:59,585
Why did you come, Onur? 

1732
01:33:00,005 --> 01:33:01,005
Well ... 

1733
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:05,100
do you know about Derin? I can not reach. 

1734
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:07,600
Derin ... 

1735
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,960
... is the school. It is in class.

1736
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:12,680
I know I quit school, bro. 

1737
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:16,780
You fought yesterday. 

1738
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,280
My name is. We were together yesterday. 

1739
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:23,440
I even texted Aunt Yasemin so she wouldn't worry. 

1740
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:24,920
Yasemin ... 

1741
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:27,840
He never informed me. He said nothing. 

1742
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:29,560
Oh Yasemin. 

1743
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,280
Said with a friend, but ... 

1744
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,760
... I didn't say it was you. I couldn't guess either. 

1745
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:36,520
I understand. 

1746
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:39,480
Yesterday everyone was probably nervous. 

1747
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,160
Onur. 

1748
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:45,740
Derin locked himself in his room. 

1749
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:48,880
He does not speak to any of us. Just for your information. 

1750
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:51,860
Well. Thanks brother. 

1751
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:54,540
Onur'cug. 

1752
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,120
This situation. 

1753
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,200
Brother ... 

1754
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,920
... I just wanted to know that Derin went home safely. 

1755
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,080
I was curious about it. 

1756
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:02,720
Thanks.

1757
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:10,780
Yasemin, Yasemin. 

1758
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,360
It is always a mystery. Always a ... 

1759
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:19,760
Everything around ... 

1760
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,320
It's broken for you to understand. 

1761
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:34,720
It's not very good if you leave home. 

1762
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:37,940
But I think yours reacted a lot too. 

1763
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:39,180
Then. 

1764
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:39,740
Then. 

1765
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,480
No, what bothers me, you know? 

1766
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:44,339
Take a decision. But nobody respects. 

1767
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,660
Nobody said it would be easy, honey. 

1768
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:50,380
So you have to show them that you are growing. 

1769
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:51,800
I'm trying. 

1770
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:52,920
Since the morning ... 

1771
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,240
... no job vacancies remain. 

1772
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:56,639
But there isn't even a waitress ad. 

1773
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:59,540
Other than that, what work will I do? I do not know that. 

1774
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:01,339
No. How serious if I have a job ...? 

1775
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:02,720
... they will understand that I am ...

1776
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:05,799
It is very difficult to find a waitress without warning. 

1777
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,540
So you have to go to the cafes one by one and talk. 

1778
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:13,180
Actually, there are some places that I know. 

1779
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,799
So if you call and give my name, they will help you. 

1780
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:18,620
I'm going to say something. Come on, get dressed. 

1781
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:20,340
I'll call a Gökhan too. 

1782
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:21,720
Thanks. 

1783
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,920
I'll go out then. 

1784
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:24,876
Because I have to go back before my mother comes back. 

1785
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:26,500
Why are you forbidden to leave the house? 

1786
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:27,800
No. 

1787
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:29,980
I don't want to meet at the door. 

1788
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:31,680
Do not be silly. 

1789
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:34,240
You are a young adult. 

1790
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,960
Then your mom will have to accept it later. 

1791
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:40,100
You are right. Here are old habits. 

1792
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,160
Go. 

1793
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:45,000
How good that you are here. 

1794
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:51,360
Go.

1795
01:35:57,100 --> 01:35:58,420
What's going on honey 

1796
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:02,420
From Sitare, I'm miserable. 

1797
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:05,540
As he stood still last night, Derin ... 

1798
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:08,160
"I'm quitting school," he snapped. 

1799
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:11,080
We try to talk but what is possible. 

1800
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:13,620
Then he knocked on the door, got out, and left. 

1801
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,160
You will understand that we have deeply entered each other. 

1802
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:17,800
God ... 

1803
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,140
... called Onur. 

1804
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,840
Thanks. He also called and reported. 

1805
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:25,500
However, he was a bit relieved. Terrible. I am miserable. 

1806
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:30,820
Finally, the owner of the mysterious phone became apparent. 

1807
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,600
Mister? 

1808
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:37,320
Onur is for you to know. He loves Derin like his brother. 

1809
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:38,860
Is his brother? 

1810
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:41,140
Oh. Don't worry, sugar. 

1811
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:43,700
The issue of descent never ends.

1812
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:46,420
He says I left this day. It starts again tomorrow. 

1813
01:36:46,540 --> 01:36:48,400
You will be left with so much pain. 

1814
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:51,760
Just drop it ... 

1815
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:54,940
How are you with Murat? 

1816
01:36:56,740 --> 01:36:57,740
That's bad. 

1817
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,820
So while you're trying to pack ... 

1818
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,300
... I rub my face. 

1819
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:05,320
Yasemin, I know. 

1820
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:09,220
Girls. 

1821
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:10,560
Aydan'cıg. 

1822
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:11,900
Yasemin, how are you? 

1823
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:13,400
Here it is the same. 

1824
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:18,360
I was telling you when you came, honey. 

1825
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:20,280
Look, I know. 

1826
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:21,620
I know it is very difficult. 

1827
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:24,440
But somehow you have to look ahead. 

1828
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:27,320
Your husband, the children have a wonderful home, honey. 

1829
01:37:28,860 --> 01:37:30,820
The female bird makes the nest. Well. 

1830
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:33,140
But it doesn't end with doing. 

1831
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,940
You have to protect it. You have to fight if necessary. 

1832
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:38,360
Isn't that right, Aydan?

1833
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:39,640
Exactly. 

1834
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:41,860
So who is it? 

1835
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:44,820
Haven't you learned who you are yet? 

1836
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:47,600
If it was, it was cracked by curiosity. 

1837
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,900
Me too, sugar. I also broke curiosity. 

1838
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:53,679
So it is difficult to fight without knowing who your enemy is. 

1839
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:55,340
It is not? 

1840
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,680
I do not know, I do not know. I do not know yet. 

1841
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:19,880
Mommy! 

1842
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:24,559
What are you doing there? 

1843
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:36,740
What are you doing there? 

1844
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:38,740
Well ... 

1845
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,780
I was going to buy ... 

1846
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:45,580
I couldn't sit on the list in my head. 

1847
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,360
What are you doing? 

1848
01:38:49,180 --> 01:38:50,180
Was outside. 

1849
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:51,700
Derin ... 

1850
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:52,200
what? 

1851
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:53,480
We need to talk. 

1852
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:57,040
Are we going to talk mom? What are you doing to me? 

1853
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:58,380
... are you going to tell me what I can and cannot do? 

1854
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:00,060
No, so don't get tired ...

1855
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:02,100
... you write a list. Give to me. I read. 

1856
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:02,720
Derin ... 

1857
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:05,160
Mom. Look, you won't be able to talk here anyway ... 

1858
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:07,160
... someone will see. You'll come back as you stretch. 

1859
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:09,040
Let's go home and talk there, okay? 

1860
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,040
Well. 

1861
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,600
Come on. 

1862
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,519
Come on, won't you come? 

1863
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:33,220
Welcome. 

1864
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:37,660
Mommy! 

1865
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:43,299
How are you honey? 

1866
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:44,900
We do watercolor. 

1867
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:46,340
Go. 

1868
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:49,640
Well dear, let me change a top. 

1869
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:00,420
Dear. 

1870
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,160
Finish the clouds until your mother arrives. 

1871
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:05,400
I'm going too. Well? 

1872
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:06,920
Here you have. 

1873
01:40:09,020 --> 01:40:10,020
How did it go? 

1874
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:11,780
It is not very bright. 

1875
01:40:14,060 --> 01:40:16,540
I met many places. Bahar has not worked. 

1876
01:40:16,540 --> 01:40:18,100
My feet exploded all day.

1877
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:21,860
My love, from day one. One thing is certain. 

1878
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:23,559
Actually there is something. 

1879
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:25,920
So your friend can configure something. 

1880
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:27,200
What a beautiful thing. 

1881
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,260
Bahar is on the boat and for a long time. This means that I don't have much. 

1882
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:33,620
Super! 

1883
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:34,820
Super too ... 

1884
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:37,559
I'm ready to take a big step ... 

1885
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:38,980
I don't know if ... 

1886
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:41,040
Derin will be a very good surprise. 

1887
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:42,560
It's a complete shock. 

1888
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:44,380
To who? 

1889
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:46,920
I mean it will be an adventure. 

1890
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:48,960
It will be a strange adventure. 

1891
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:50,340
Say yes ... 

1892
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,040
Don't be silly. 

1893
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:55,520
Think of it like this, a long vacation. 

1894
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:58,660
Then. That's. 

1895
01:40:59,140 --> 01:41:01,780
You haven't come yet. Sister Bahar. 

1896
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,120
We need to speak confidently.

1897
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:06,340
Okay, but look at us for now. Well? 

1898
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:07,480
OK Do not worry. 

1899
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:09,060
Sister Bahar. 

1900
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:11,320
It will be beautiful. 

1901
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:25,420
I left you the salad dressing. 

1902
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:27,800
I washed the vegetables, but dried them. 

1903
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:31,179
No more rice. 

1904
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:34,525
Well, you're great, Mrs. Filiz. 

1905
01:41:34,525 --> 01:41:35,416
After that, I have it. 

1906
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:37,260
Maybe you are interested in something else. 

1907
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:42,660
Look Mom. 

1908
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:45,640
It is very beautiful darling. 

1909
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:47,400
There is also my sister Bahar. 

1910
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:48,880
I see. 

1911
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:51,600
Let me see. 

1912
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:55,080
This is great. 

1913
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,360
Shall we paint the tree together? 

1914
01:41:57,620 --> 01:41:59,460
Of course. What color is it? 

1915
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:01,120
I do not know. What do you want? 

1916
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:03,840
Let my sister Bahar choose. 

1917
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:09,420
It is purple? 

1918
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:13,220
Your mother had a very nice dress. It was also purple.

1919
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:19,960
Oh yeah. You were dressed for my father's birthday. 

1920
01:42:20,420 --> 01:42:21,420
No way. 

1921
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:29,440
I mean, there is no purple tree. 

1922
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:37,660
I am sorry. 

1923
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:39,280
I forgot it. 

1924
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:43,040
Let's make another color. 

1925
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:44,560
Let's not make it purple. It will not be purple. 

1926
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,160
Oh why not dear? 

1927
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:48,839
There are many purple-flowered trees, right? 

1928
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:51,799
It was unanimously accepted at the time. 

1929
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:53,420
Take it. 

1930
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:58,080
Mother, is my sister Bahar going to eat? 

1931
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:01,580
Yes. This is a great idea. 

1932
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:03,860
Yes. Great idea! 

1933
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:05,639
I said that, lamb. 

1934
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:08,140
Bahar, stay for lunch. 

1935
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:11,140
Yes Yes Yes! 

1936
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,180
Mom, say something. 

1937
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:29,940
Mom, what happened? Let me see. 

1938
01:43:29,940 --> 01:43:31,400
Ok nothing nothing nothing nothing. 

1939
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:32,059
Chopped up. 

1940
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:33,460
Ok, I'm fine. There is nothing. 

1941
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:39,880
Does it hurt mom?

1942
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,860
It does not hurt. I do not have anything. 

1943
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,180
What happened so suddenly? 

1944
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,100
Evil eye for sure. 

1945
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:53,160
Girls, by the way, you're so cute, but ... 

1946
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:55,500
... I have a very important job tonight. 

1947
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:58,160
Maybe I'll stay another night. 

1948
01:43:58,160 --> 01:43:59,160
Well. 

1949
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:02,120
Let me wash it there. 

1950
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:03,120
Yes please. 

1951
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:07,120
Oh God. Here they are ... 

1952
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:35,580
I don't think there are any fish. 

1953
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:40,080
Let. There is hope. 

1954
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,440
You fell early today, boy. 

1955
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:46,980
I'm confused, dad. 

1956
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:51,120
My dear never wanted to go home. I came here. 

1957
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,160
If you need to make up your mind about e ... 

1958
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:56,920
... confused of course. 

1959
01:44:57,620 --> 01:44:59,320
Because every choice leaves one ... 

1960
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:00,540
... didn't they say it in vain? 

1961
01:45:01,180 --> 01:45:03,600
Nothing is under my control. Nothing. 

1962
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:06,980
Don't check it then.

1963
01:45:08,140 --> 01:45:10,020
Let everyone act as you know. 

1964
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:11,800
You did not tell me? 

1965
01:45:11,980 --> 01:45:14,519
I want to fly. Just because I want to be myself. 

1966
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:16,980
Let them live as they want. 

1967
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:30,760
So why do you think everything has happened? 

1968
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:36,040
Where did I go wrong with this job? 

1969
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:37,980
What have I done? 

1970
01:45:39,820 --> 01:45:42,420
There is a story about Prometheus. 

1971
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:44,460
Steal the fire of the gods ... 

1972
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:47,420
... give it to the people. When people see the fire ... 

1973
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:50,220
... they ignited. This is not liked by the gods at all. 

1974
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:52,740
They punish Prometheus. 

1975
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:56,639
Actually, that story doesn't end like this. There is more. 

1976
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:00,340
The main god Zeus was so angry that ... 

1977
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:02,640
... he wants people to be punished too. 

1978
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:06,000
They create a woman from the earth and the water. 

1979
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:07,140
Pandora ...

1980
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:11,780
They adorn this woman. They dress very well. 

1981
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:13,775
Whatever your own beauty ... 

1982
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:15,940
... they equip it and send it to earth. 

1983
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:16,940
Why is that? 

1984
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:19,440
To match the brother of Prometheus. 

1985
01:46:19,900 --> 01:46:21,160
Epimetheus. 

1986
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:25,400
All the gifts and most importantly ... 

1987
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:29,860
... Zeus urges him to open up ... 

1988
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:32,599
... match the box with Epimetheus Pandora. 

1989
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:36,599
Come on, now, husband and wife ... 

1990
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:38,700
... well okay, they say okay. 

1991
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:41,220
They wonder what's in this box. 

1992
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:43,200
Epimetheus first ... 

1993
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:46,460
... does not want to open the box, afraid that they will come out, but ... 

1994
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:48,680
Is Pandora like that? 

1995
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:51,460
... inside out of curiosity. 

1996
01:46:53,380 --> 01:46:54,380
Later ... 

1997
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:57,760
... can't stand the charm of Pandora's beauty ... 

1998
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:58,780
... Epimetheus.

1999
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:00,440
He says ok. 

2000
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:02,160
Let's open the box. 

2001
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:04,680
Tell me, how does it look from the edge? 

2002
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,080
Husband and wife open the box. 

2003
01:47:09,020 --> 01:47:10,020
A lie ... 

2004
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:14,759
Anger, jealousy, envy ... 

2005
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:18,560
In other words, whatever is bad distributes to the earth. 

2006
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:21,059
Husband and wife ... 

2007
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:24,200
... want to avoid it, but fail. 

2008
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:27,580
Pandora's box ... 

2009
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:30,000
... opened once. 

2010
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:36,320
The husband and wife repent. They close the box but ... 

2011
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:37,440
Box in ... 

2012
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:40,800
... nothing but hope. 

2013
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:44,060
Oh our boy ... 

2014
01:47:44,780 --> 01:47:46,300
That's your story. 

2015
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:50,280
But you did, but you opened the box like this. 

2016
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:51,640
There is no cure. 

2017
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:53,500
You cannot go back. 

2018
01:47:54,140 --> 01:47:55,500
Like Epimetheus. 

2019
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,540
Do you know what Epimetheus means? 

2020
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:02,080
It means thinking later.

2021
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:08,140
I mean who thinks what I did. 

2022
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:10,320
Just like me. 

2023
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:13,120
I have nothing but hope. 

2024
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:15,679
It is like our child. 

2025
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:18,660
Like that ... 

2026
01:48:35,620 --> 01:48:37,760
Let's talk at night, okay? 

2027
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:40,580
Do not worry. We should talk about it. 

2028
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:41,580
Well. 

2029
01:48:41,965 --> 01:48:43,260
Come on, don't get cold. 

2030
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:44,620
Ok come on kiss I see you .. 

2031
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:45,620
Goodbye. 

2032
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:01,100
You're going? 

2033
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:11,800
How are you? 

2034
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:13,760
I do not know. 

2035
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:16,920
Little strange, of course. Everything. 

2036
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:19,940
The girls were very happy because I came. 

2037
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:22,879
Yasemin is also nervous. 

2038
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:26,580
He looks at me like he's killing me. 

2039
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:31,340
I don't know Murat ... 

2040
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:33,240
On the one hand ... 

2041
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:35,680
I think excuse for the girls. 

2042
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:38,120
It is a ridiculous situation. 

2043
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:40,560
You fell into this situation because of me, Bahar.

2044
01:49:41,060 --> 01:49:42,240
I'm sorry but ... 

2045
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:44,780
You see, I have nothing to do. 

2046
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:48,000
Whatever, no matter. 

2047
01:49:50,660 --> 01:49:51,940
You don't have a crime either. 

2048
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:56,780
No, do you know what is bad? 

2049
01:49:57,300 --> 01:49:59,660
I love Derin and Ece. 

2050
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:02,500
It's good for me to spend time with them. 

2051
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:04,760
Now to take it off ... 

2052
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:06,380
... to be an excuse ... 

2053
01:50:06,380 --> 01:50:07,780
... it goes to my strength. Do you get it? 

2054
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:11,700
I don't want to lie to you. 

2055
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:14,960
I don't want to lie to anyone, Bahar. 

2056
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:16,620
No one. 

2057
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:19,340
I even want to hug you now ... 

2058
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:22,500
... I mean everything will be fine, but ... 

2059
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:25,340
... I can't say. 

2060
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:28,220
I know. 

2061
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:46,240
Look girl, this photo is beautiful. 

2062
01:50:46,540 --> 01:50:48,780
Oh dad, this Bahar is crazy. 

2063
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:57,460
If you see him today, he handled Ece that way.

2064
01:50:57,460 --> 01:51:00,360
Kuzum couldn't cry to cry. I looked like this. 

2065
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:01,700
Tell me, miss ... 

2066
01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:03,980
what is this? I'm going to quit school, nonsense. 

2067
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:10,240
My mom. 

2068
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:15,800
Sight. I thought a lot. My classes ... 

2069
01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:19,300
I find it difficult to adapt to my classes. 

2070
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:20,500
I said why. 

2071
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:23,320
"Why?" I asked him. Why don't I want to go to school? 

2072
01:51:25,540 --> 01:51:27,140
I don't want to be a pianist. 

2073
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:28,599
My daughter ... 

2074
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:32,500
... finishes your school. Don't be a pianist if you want. 

2075
01:51:32,780 --> 01:51:34,019
You will be what you want to be. 

2076
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:37,040
Officially nonsense. 

2077
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:38,780
He didn't have to be a pianist. 

2078
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:41,960
Derin'ci, are you going to throw away ten whole years? 

2079
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:43,100
I'm wrong? 

2080
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:47,900
Mom, I say I don't want to be a pianist. 

2081
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:49,400
You don't understand what this is. 

2082
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:51,880
Look Derin. Look ... 

2083
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:53,800
... when you choose this ...

2084
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:56,320
... we had the same discussions with you. 

2085
01:51:56,440 --> 01:51:58,835
I don't want it because I don't want it. 

2086
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:02,080
... you opposed me. You threw yourself there. Look ... 

2087
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:04,280
... I was finally right. Turns out ... 

2088
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:05,900
... you don't want to be a pianist. 

2089
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:07,960
Mother, are you kidding me? 

2090
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:11,160
I was twelve or twelve. 

2091
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:12,560
Don't yell Derin. 

2092
01:52:12,860 --> 01:52:13,860
Deep. 

2093
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:15,040
My daughter. 

2094
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:17,460
First of all, speak calmly. 

2095
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:18,740
You too, Yasemin. 

2096
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:22,720
Look ... I couldn't understand ... 

2097
01:52:23,540 --> 01:52:25,700
Finish your school. Why don't you finish your school? 

2098
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:29,380
You don't have to be a pianist, honey. 

2099
01:52:29,780 --> 01:52:31,240
There is half a semester here. 

2100
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:33,320
Are you going to waste them all? 

2101
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:35,400
Finish it. Don't be a pianist. 

2102
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:38,500
Daddy, I can't touch. 

2103
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:40,660
My daughter, what is that? Why is that?

2104
01:52:41,060 --> 01:52:42,780
What should I tell you? 

2105
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:46,540
This means that it could not be sufficiently prepared. Well? 

2106
01:52:46,540 --> 01:52:49,320
As a result, why are we experiencing this crisis now? 

2107
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:50,620
Why do we live? 

2108
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:52,780
Because the final exam is coming up, either ... 

2109
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:56,660
Isn't this a regular crisis that we experience every year? 

2110
01:52:56,820 --> 01:52:57,900
I know wrong? 

2111
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:00,080
Now he leaves school without wanting to leave. 

2112
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:02,019
Then he regrets it. 

2113
01:53:02,020 --> 01:53:03,200
He tries to go back. 

2114
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:04,240
I'm not going! 

2115
01:53:04,860 --> 01:53:06,240
Mom, my decision is final. 

2116
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:09,060
So what did you think for so many years my dear? 

2117
01:53:09,460 --> 01:53:12,140
When you put the egg in the door, you are standing in front of us. 

2118
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:13,520
Did you think about that now? 

2119
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:14,960
Yasemin. 

2120
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:18,280
Do we listen to our son? Are we going to understand if you want?

2121
01:53:18,580 --> 01:53:20,360
What are we going to hear exactly? 

2122
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:23,679
As if these teenage crises were personality ... 

2123
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:26,760
... I really can't believe I ate it. 

2124
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,060
Teen crisis? 

2125
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:30,380
If it is. That is exactly Derin. 

2126
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:32,580
Who wants to go to that school instead of you ... 

2127
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:34,840
... do you know how many people want to be in your place? 

2128
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:37,220
They are dying to be in your place. 

2129
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:38,720
What's up mom? 

2130
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:40,360
What about me? 

2131
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:41,580
Don't yell Derin. 

2132
01:53:41,580 --> 01:53:43,059
That's what I'm talking about. 

2133
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:44,060
My daughter! 

2134
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:46,020
Don't yell at your mother. 

2135
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:48,560
Whatever you say, please tell me correctly. 

2136
01:53:48,860 --> 01:53:51,300
Pay attention to the tone of your voice for God's sake, Derin. 

2137
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:54,559
Recently, we have been infamous enough with the neighbors. 

2138
01:53:58,120 --> 01:54:00,320
Isn't that you, mom?

2139
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:03,280
Who thinks what the real world says, right? 

2140
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:06,400
Trying to put us all in the picture he drew ... 

2141
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:08,139
... but what we want ... 

2142
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:11,240
... you don't care how we feel, do you? 

2143
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:12,940
But how do we see ourselves from the outside? 

2144
01:54:12,940 --> 01:54:14,759
Look, it's very important to you. 

2145
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:17,260
For example, being a pianist is very important. 

2146
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:20,160
Because you can show off like that to your friends, right? 

2147
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:22,300
You couldn't even finish that stupid school. 

2148
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:25,140
But the girl finished that big greenhouse. 

2149
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:27,640
The conservatory you haven't even gotten into ... 

2150
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:30,719
... are you going to feel good because you're done, mom? 

2151
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:34,080
What you don't understand is that this is my life. 

2152
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:36,860
For your life and I have my own life ... 

2153
01:54:36,860 --> 01:54:39,080
... I want to live as I want. Well?

2154
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:44,620
Derin ... 

2155
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:46,820
... if you want to make your own decisions ... 

2156
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:49,760
... then you have to stand on your own two feet. 

2157
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:57,400
Here we are mom. 

2158
01:54:57,940 --> 01:54:58,940
I agree. 

2159
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:11,120
Is this a word to say to the boy for crying out loud, Yasemin? 

2160
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,020
Why are you doing like this? 

2161
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:20,320
I really wonder why you are doing it. 

2162
01:55:32,380 --> 01:55:33,820
I hate her. 

2163
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:39,400
Bahar, I made up my mind. I go. 

2164
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:40,740
I also called Gökhan. 

2165
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:44,400
Oh, that was very bad. So in which pattern are you right? 

2166
01:55:45,260 --> 01:55:48,320
But whatever. I think it will be good for all of you to escape. 

2167
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:51,600
I will miss you a little. 

2168
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:55,620
Thanks. 

2169
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:59,440
Why is that? I did not do anything. 

2170
01:55:59,660 --> 01:56:03,260
It's okay? Did you hear me. You were with me. 

2171
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:06,000
I couldn't have done any of this without you.

2172
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,080
We are friends. 

2173
01:56:08,540 --> 01:56:09,540
They do. 

2174
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:12,240
Maybe it would be a little later, but you would. 

2175
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:16,880
I'm very curious about my mother's face when I say I'll go. 

2176
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:21,040
It's not like a very good idea, Derin. 

2177
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:22,440
Why is that? 

2178
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:24,840
Think about it, when you say it now ... 

2179
01:56:25,060 --> 01:56:27,040
... it will say that you are threatening me with this. 

2180
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:28,700
You'll get on your nerves. 

2181
01:56:29,140 --> 01:56:31,420
If you go, he will say it was my stubbornness. 

2182
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:33,960
But if you don't get advertised ... 

2183
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:36,280
... then exactly how you want it ... 

2184
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:38,559
... the shape of your face will be worth seeing. 

2185
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:39,960
Just think. 

2186
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:42,640
They won't even scream in front of you. 

2187
01:56:43,540 --> 01:56:44,540
You are right. 

2188
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:47,660
You are right. It is better to go without telling anyone. 

2189
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:49,480
Exactly. 

2190
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:41,800
Welcome. 

2191
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:44,200
Where did you stay, darling?

2192
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:46,040
My makeup is on, Sitare. 

2193
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:48,660
But you are beautiful, Ağa. 

2194
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:50,160
Thanks. 

2195
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:57,660
Everything looks great. Bless your hands. 

2196
01:58:57,660 --> 01:58:58,660
Thanks, sweetie. 

2197
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:01,040
I hope they're all Aydan ... 

2198
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:02,500
... you didn't bother to go it alone. 

2199
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:04,060
Of course I didn't bother. 

2200
01:59:04,100 --> 01:59:05,140
Possible, dear? 

2201
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:07,900
My wife helped a lot in the preparation. 

2202
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:10,220
What kind of man are you? 

2203
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:12,600
Didn't you just say that I organized everything? 

2204
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:15,700
Look at ağa. You make jokes like this. 

2205
01:59:15,860 --> 01:59:17,500
They will think the truth. 

2206
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:20,600
Oh dear, I'm not taking Barlas seriously ... 

2207
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:21,960
... I learned that years ago. 

2208
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:24,559
My wife puts it in her mouth too. 

2209
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:31,660
Look, the little prince came too. 

2210
01:59:31,940 --> 01:59:33,299
Thanks. Good night. 

2211
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:34,400
Hi dear.

2212
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,440
We found it good, mom. 

2213
01:59:37,340 --> 01:59:38,440
Hi handsome. 

2214
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:39,179
Hello Brother. 

2215
01:59:39,180 --> 01:59:40,300
What are you doing, brother, are you okay? 

2216
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:41,440
Exactly brother. How are you? 

2217
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:42,440
Well. 

2218
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:44,800
Isn't Derin here? 

2219
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:46,960
Derin's head hurts a little. He stayed at home. 

2220
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:51,980
Yasemin, do you drink anything? What are we seeing as a movie? 

2221
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:53,720
Go. 

2222
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:55,380
Let's gossip. Let's do it. 

2223
01:59:55,380 --> 01:59:56,380
Will you sit? 

2224
01:59:56,420 --> 01:59:57,340
I'm good. 

2225
01:59:57,400 --> 01:59:58,519
I will have something to drink. 

2226
01:59:58,520 --> 01:59:59,840
Well darling. 

2227
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:01,080
Come on and sit down. 

2228
02:00:02,420 --> 02:00:03,420
Excuse me ... 

2229
02:00:05,140 --> 02:00:06,140
Yes guys. 

2230
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:07,540
Finished ... 

2231
02:00:08,180 --> 02:00:09,960
Welcome to the 20th anniversary. 

2232
02:00:10,860 --> 02:00:12,719
I'm going to give you drinks, right? 

2233
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:13,320
I am a host. 

2234
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:14,019
I can give. 

2235
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:15,060
You are not a stranger, Barlas.

2236
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:16,060
Are you tired. 

2237
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:17,400
Come honey 

2238
02:00:21,220 --> 02:00:22,220
You are drinking? 

2239
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:24,620
Onur. Handsome, are you going to drink? 

2240
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:26,160
No brother. I'm not going to drink. Thank you. 

2241
02:00:26,740 --> 02:00:29,000
Play sweetly. Well? Go Go. 

2242
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:31,599
Really, why didn't Derin come? 

2243
02:00:32,380 --> 02:00:34,080
It doesn't feel good at all. 

2244
02:00:35,780 --> 02:00:37,759
Same story again, darling? 

2245
02:00:38,100 --> 02:00:39,220
Sitare is not talking to me. 

2246
02:00:39,660 --> 02:00:40,660
I swear. 

2247
02:00:40,940 --> 02:00:41,440
No. 

2248
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:43,240
One, two again with his father ... 

2249
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:44,500
... he talks. 

2250
02:00:44,860 --> 02:00:46,280
He's very angry with me. 

2251
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:48,400
School. 

2252
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:51,480
My life is not going, nor is it going to school. 

2253
02:00:51,720 --> 02:00:54,760
So I spoke to management. What can we do, what can we do? 

2254
02:00:54,940 --> 02:00:57,219
I don't know how long they will succeed. 

2255
02:00:58,240 --> 02:00:59,480
God. 

2256
02:01:00,140 --> 02:01:03,000
Sometimes I am glad that we really did not have children.

2257
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:06,160
Where did that come from out of nowhere? 

2258
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:10,120
What are you doing at home all day? 

2259
02:01:10,540 --> 02:01:12,080
What does my life do at home all day? 

2260
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:14,380
He's doing nothing but pouting. 

2261
02:02:04,360 --> 02:02:05,500
It's not going to work, honey. 

2262
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:06,760
Both with the caretaker. 

2263
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:08,160
She's so bad. 

2264
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:10,180
Of course, Hilal is destroyed. 

2265
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:11,960
The woman stopped crying. 

2266
02:02:12,240 --> 02:02:13,240
Pity. 

2267
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:14,900
You? 

2268
02:02:16,700 --> 02:02:17,700
It's me? 

2269
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:19,500
What did you do? 

2270
02:02:20,980 --> 02:02:21,980
So ... 

2271
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:23,420
... Growing to ... 

2272
02:02:23,580 --> 02:02:25,059
... I'm so sorry to say my sweet ... 

2273
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:26,940
... you come and tell us here, right? 

2274
02:02:26,940 --> 02:02:27,980
I understand it well. 

2275
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:30,640
What does that mean, Yasemin? 

2276
02:02:31,060 --> 02:02:33,300
No. I wonder, so you ... 

2277
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:34,920
I wonder ... 

2278
02:02:35,220 --> 02:02:35,920
... you know me too ... 

2279
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:37,280
... here and there ...

2280
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,760
Ay Yasemin is really enough. 

2281
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:42,040
Your setup played well. 

2282
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:44,200
Your ear doesn't hear your mouth, sugar. 

2283
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:46,880
No. What do I have to do with Hilal? 

2284
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:48,280
Out of your mouth. 

2285
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:50,020
Of course I will come and tell it. 

2286
02:02:50,140 --> 02:02:52,260
You said it like a child. 

2287
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:54,380
I'm going to have something to eat. 

2288
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:56,640
You broke my way. 

2289
02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:02,600
Aydan, I'm talking nonsense, right? 

2290
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:05,260
So what you have to do with Hilal is really. 

2291
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:06,160
Certain. 

2292
02:03:06,340 --> 02:03:09,640
The woman mounted her husband with a babysitter at the hotel. 

2293
02:03:10,660 --> 02:03:12,139
He is deluded. 

2294
02:03:12,860 --> 02:03:13,860
Horn. 

2295
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:15,139
Let's close. 

2296
02:03:15,420 --> 02:03:16,420
Let's close the topic. 

2297
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:22,880
How do you do this to yourself? 

2298
02:03:24,820 --> 02:03:25,820
Mom, I'm going. 

2299
02:03:26,620 --> 02:03:27,620
Where my dear? 

2300
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:30,600
So ... 

2301
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:32,420
Are you going to a special place?

2302
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:35,260
I will meet with friends. No extension. 

2303
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:37,220
I didn't say anything right, my dear Onur. 

2304
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:39,400
Come on, have fun. Goodbye. 

2305
02:03:41,860 --> 02:03:44,040
Come on, Ece. Come beautiful girl. 

2306
02:03:48,380 --> 02:03:49,780
Come and sit. 

2307
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:50,940
Let's shoot a little. 

2308
02:03:51,180 --> 02:03:52,700
Let's sit like this. 

2309
02:03:54,780 --> 02:03:55,780
Good for you. 

2310
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:57,140
Good for you. 

2311
02:03:59,220 --> 02:03:59,780
Sitare ... 

2312
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:02,179
You say auntie. Sitare aunt. 

2313
02:04:03,460 --> 02:04:05,040
Ay Barlas, don't interfere. 

2314
02:04:05,460 --> 02:04:08,160
I don't like it anyway, Aunt Meyze. 

2315
02:04:09,460 --> 02:04:11,000
Sitare is sugar. 

2316
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:13,720
I'm hungry. 

2317
02:04:13,940 --> 02:04:14,620
Well. 

2318
02:04:14,780 --> 02:04:16,460
Let's prepare something for you. Eat. 

2319
02:04:16,740 --> 02:04:18,099
Can you eat it alone? 

2320
02:04:18,580 --> 02:04:19,820
Take your fork. 

2321
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:22,560
Which one do you want? 

2322
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:24,480
From this. 

2323
02:04:24,660 --> 02:04:25,300
Well. 

2324
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:26,820
Anyway, think no more. 

2325
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:28,380
It is happening. 

2326
02:04:31,480 --> 02:04:32,500
I put. 

2327
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:33,320
Other. 

2328
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:34,500
From this.

2329
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:35,580
White? It is black? 

2330
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:36,380
Black. 

2331
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:40,120
Ay Barlas, your grandfather likes this too. It is not? 

2332
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:43,520
Other. 

2333
02:04:44,060 --> 02:04:45,100
And this. 

2334
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:48,100
It doesn't happen, but it's sauce. 

2335
02:04:48,100 --> 02:04:49,500
Then don't be mad at us. 

2336
02:04:49,660 --> 02:04:50,660
Not angry, not angry. 

2337
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:52,860
Sister Bahar is giving me at home. 

2338
02:04:55,900 --> 02:04:57,100
Who is Bahar's sister? 

2339
02:04:57,240 --> 02:04:58,780
He comes to play with me. 

2340
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:00,260
A very sweet sister. 

2341
02:05:02,420 --> 02:05:03,520
The caregiver is safe. 

2342
02:05:03,980 --> 02:05:04,639
I suppose. 

2343
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:05,960
He is not a caregiver. 

2344
02:05:06,020 --> 02:05:07,160
He is my friend. 

2345
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:08,680
He bought me a baby. 

2346
02:05:09,020 --> 02:05:11,020
If you come tomorrow, we will play with you. 

2347
02:05:11,500 --> 02:05:13,840
It's okay anyway, sugar. Come on, like this ... 

2348
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:16,540
... I put. You eat it here. 

2349
02:05:16,660 --> 02:05:18,940
Come on, eat. I have a bit of work. 

2350
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:21,780
Slow. Be careful. 

2351
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:50,300
What happened?

2352
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:51,980
I do not know. 

2353
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:53,880
Derin'cig ... 

2354
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:55,660
... I don't know what it means? 

2355
02:05:55,900 --> 02:05:57,696
You probably won't say that I gave up. 

2356
02:05:57,720 --> 02:05:59,060
No no .. 

2357
02:06:00,580 --> 02:06:02,000
I'm scared, Bahar. 

2358
02:06:02,260 --> 02:06:04,840
So, in a small boat, with a lot of people ... 

2359
02:06:05,300 --> 02:06:06,380
... if I fail. 

2360
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:07,800
Honey ... 

2361
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:09,500
What's going to go wrong? 

2362
02:06:09,500 --> 02:06:11,000
You will make tea and coffee at the bottom. 

2363
02:06:11,240 --> 02:06:12,620
What happens if you fail? 

2364
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:14,320
I guess they can't throw you into the sea. 

2365
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:19,040
Without telling my mom and dad ... 

2366
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:20,280
... do you think it's okay to go? 

2367
02:06:20,440 --> 02:06:21,940
At least I was calling my father. 

2368
02:06:21,940 --> 02:06:22,940
No way. 

2369
02:06:24,940 --> 02:06:26,120
Derin, no. 

2370
02:06:26,540 --> 02:06:28,480
He goes and tells your mother. Everything is ruined. 

2371
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:30,440
You can't go anywhere. 

2372
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:32,240
So ... 

2373
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:34,540
... give up, don't go.

2374
02:06:35,620 --> 02:06:37,920
But I think it will be a huge failure if you give up. 

2375
02:06:38,700 --> 02:06:39,700
Are you saying that? 

2376
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:44,180
It would be great for you to embark on this adventure, darling. 

2377
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:48,820
Looking for Onur. 

2378
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:51,240
Normal, phones are for this. Here you have. 

2379
02:06:51,860 --> 02:06:52,860
In ... 

2380
02:06:53,700 --> 02:06:55,200
... we're still mad at it. 

2381
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:56,420
So we never talk. 

2382
02:06:56,420 --> 02:06:58,420
After talking to someone ... 

2383
02:06:58,820 --> 02:06:59,820
I didn't talk either. 

2384
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:01,500
I think you did your best. 

2385
02:07:02,140 --> 02:07:04,000
So let's think a bit in your mind. 

2386
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:05,860
No, I'll call Onur. 

2387
02:07:05,860 --> 02:07:07,860
You're going to ruin all of Derin. 

2388
02:07:09,980 --> 02:07:11,580
So darling 

2389
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,280
Look, if you leave now without warning ... 

2390
02:07:14,980 --> 02:07:16,339
... it comes to Onur's mind. 

2391
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,140
After all, it means I'm going ... 

2392
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:19,940
... take it and go to the suitcase. 

2393
02:07:20,780 --> 02:07:22,740
Do you forget what you told yourself?

2394
02:07:24,040 --> 02:07:25,880
You told me I was judging you. 

2395
02:07:26,380 --> 02:07:28,280
Please soften so fast. 

2396
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:31,660
Like I said, if you leave now ... 

2397
02:07:32,140 --> 02:07:34,200
Onur will come to his mind. I'm sure. 

2398
02:07:34,660 --> 02:07:35,900
You will understand what you have lost. 

2399
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:37,620
Are you sure? 

2400
02:07:37,980 --> 02:07:39,620
Jump with surprise maybe to the plane ... 

2401
02:07:39,780 --> 02:07:42,099
... it arrives at one of the cities that you anchored. 

2402
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:44,140
This is not a difficult thing for him. 

2403
02:07:44,700 --> 02:07:46,460
Wouldn't it be more romantic like this? 

2404
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:48,340
Then. 

2405
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:50,580
I also believe it. Believe me 

2406
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:52,420
Go. 

2407
02:07:57,240 --> 02:07:59,300
You put me a little again. 

2408
02:08:03,980 --> 02:08:05,339
Are you crazy? 

2409
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:07,500
Why do you keep bringing that girl home? 

2410
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:10,200
Which girl? What are you saying Sitare? 

2411
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:11,760
Don't fake Yasemin. 

2412
02:08:12,020 --> 02:08:13,560
You know who I'm talking about. 

2413
02:08:17,020 --> 02:08:19,580
Ece, when Bahar said sister, I got a shot from my brain.

2414
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:21,320
I guess you were crazy. 

2415
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:23,400
There is no other explanation for this. 

2416
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:25,220
You are either manic or very pure. 

2417
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:27,559
Was you. 

2418
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:31,240
It was you who knew everything. 

2419
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,060
You know Bahar. 

2420
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:34,860
This is not our topic, Yasemin. 

2421
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:36,440
And you didn't tell me. 

2422
02:08:43,820 --> 02:08:45,580
I didn't say anything to anyone. 

2423
02:08:46,180 --> 02:08:48,600
Sitare could at least have warned me. 

2424
02:08:50,660 --> 02:08:51,660
I can not believe. 

2425
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:54,180
That's why you interrogated this girl at our house. 

2426
02:08:55,140 --> 02:08:57,480
And then he looked me in the eye ... 

2427
02:08:57,780 --> 02:08:59,120
... you lied Sitare. 

2428
02:08:59,420 --> 02:09:00,420
I can not believe you. 

2429
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:01,460
Did you tell Aydan? 

2430
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:02,840
No, sugar. 

2431
02:09:03,220 --> 02:09:04,360
Of course I didn't say it. 

2432
02:09:04,700 --> 02:09:05,360
How can I know ... 

2433
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:07,259
... honey, you'll act like that stupid. 

2434
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:09,860
I didn't tell anyone so it wouldn't spill.

2435
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:13,500
Look at me, Yasemin. Meet yourself. 

2436
02:09:14,300 --> 02:09:16,436
You need to send that girl away from home immediately. 

2437
02:09:16,460 --> 02:09:18,920
Otherwise, you will completely lose your husband. 

2438
02:09:29,660 --> 02:09:30,260
Well. 

2439
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:32,220
Well enough now. 

2440
02:09:32,580 --> 02:09:33,900
You will make me cry too. 

2441
02:09:33,980 --> 02:09:35,740
Well well. I go. 

2442
02:09:37,640 --> 02:09:38,640
Bahar ... 

2443
02:09:38,660 --> 02:09:40,620
... will be the craziest thing I've ever done in my life. 

2444
02:09:40,860 --> 02:09:41,440
Honey, this ... 

2445
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:43,280
... will be the first crazy thing I ever do in your life. 

2446
02:09:44,100 --> 02:09:44,800
Yes. 

2447
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:45,800
Right. 

2448
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:48,340
I go. 

2449
02:09:48,540 --> 02:09:49,300
I will see. 

2450
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:50,600
I will see. 

2451
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:54,760
Welcome. 

2452
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:55,760
Hello everybody. 

2453
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:57,880
We are waiting for someone. We will get up soon. 

2454
02:09:57,960 --> 02:09:59,520
Do you want me to take your suitcase to the ship? 

2455
02:09:59,780 --> 02:10:02,040
It would be great. Thanks. 

2456
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:05,240
Bahar. 

2457
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:07,780
We were waiting for someone. If you want to go wait.

2458
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:08,900
Very good honey. 

2459
02:10:09,340 --> 02:10:10,580
Take care, okay? 

2460
02:10:10,580 --> 02:10:11,580
Equally. 

2461
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:13,220
Thanks again. 

2462
02:10:13,760 --> 02:10:15,240
I will see. 

2463
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:41,200
Come on girl. 

2464
02:10:44,860 --> 02:10:46,240
Are you waiting in the hall? 

2465
02:10:46,860 --> 02:10:48,860
Let me put Ece to bed. Let's talk. 

2466
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:50,000
Well. 

2467
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:53,320
I guess you're not worried about the kids being home this time. 

2468
02:10:54,420 --> 02:10:56,420
We have to talk about this now. 

2469
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:57,420
My lamb. 

2470
02:10:57,620 --> 02:10:58,280
Come. 

2471
02:10:58,440 --> 02:10:59,440
Go to sleep. 

2472
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:01,260
Good night my princess, my dear. 

2473
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:17,520
Onur. 

2474
02:11:18,020 --> 02:11:19,020
Hello. 

2475
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:23,040
I know you will be mad when you see this video. 

2476
02:11:23,940 --> 02:11:25,719
Maybe even a little broken. 

2477
02:11:26,180 --> 02:11:27,180
You are also right. 

2478
02:11:27,860 --> 02:11:28,860
But ... 

2479
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:29,580
I ... 

2480
02:11:29,580 --> 02:11:31,420
... to give up, tell my mother ... 

2481
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:33,380
I was afraid you would stop me. 

2482
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:36,640
But...

2483
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:39,340
I didn't want to go without saying goodbye. 

2484
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:40,920
So ... 

2485
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:42,400
... Take care. 

2486
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:45,420
Goodbye. 

2487
02:11:50,680 --> 02:11:52,380
I'm a little scared. 

2488
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,520
Actually because ... 

2489
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:56,560
... with people I've never met ... 

2490
02:11:57,320 --> 02:11:59,820
I'm going on a time adventure. 

2491
02:12:01,080 --> 02:12:02,500
I'm scared but ... 

2492
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:04,400
... I have to do this too. 

2493
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:05,940
Because to my mother otherwise ... 

2494
02:12:06,340 --> 02:12:08,480
I can't prove I'm an adult. 

2495
02:12:10,540 --> 02:12:11,540
Anyway ... 

2496
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:13,800
... let me show you a bit of our ship. 

2497
02:12:16,600 --> 02:12:17,600
Such. 

2498
02:12:19,060 --> 02:12:20,060
Such. 

2499
02:12:21,660 --> 02:12:22,660
This is also the case. 

2500
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:26,880
Her name is Tiririme. 

2501
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:29,960
I think it meant a ship in very absurd Greek. 

2502
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:32,059
Eccentric types that you will understand. 

2503
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:33,720
So ... 

2504
02:12:34,100 --> 02:12:35,420
... they're a bit strange. 

2505
02:12:35,940 --> 02:12:37,559
I don't know how to deal, but ...

2506
02:12:37,560 --> 02:12:39,340
... somehow I'll get along. 

2507
02:12:40,340 --> 02:12:43,460
Anyway, with this output, the video will be one hour long. 

2508
02:12:43,540 --> 02:12:45,200
Let me not stretch anymore. 

2509
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:49,840
I'd be glad if you call me from time to time. 

2510
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:51,980
Well ... 

2511
02:12:52,060 --> 02:12:53,620
... if you're still not mad at me. 

2512
02:13:18,940 --> 02:13:20,839
Here you have. Sleep beautifully. 

2513
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:22,200
Story. 

2514
02:13:22,680 --> 02:13:23,680
It is a tale? 

2515
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:25,520
It is too late for the story. 

2516
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:27,300
It is a party or a fairy tale. 

2517
02:13:33,100 --> 02:13:35,000
Why did you organize your babies like this? 

2518
02:13:36,860 --> 02:13:37,780
We played a new game ... 

2519
02:13:37,880 --> 02:13:39,720
... with my sister Bahar. 

2520
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:43,900
Tell me, what kind of game is this? 

2521
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:47,480
Ece baby is sleeping with Bahar baby. 

2522
02:13:50,060 --> 02:13:51,620
What is Murat doing baby there? 

2523
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:54,880
He waits. 

2524
02:13:57,980 --> 02:14:01,019
You're waiting for me. 

2525
02:14:11,660 --> 02:14:13,440
What is Yasemin doing baby?

2526
02:14:13,940 --> 02:14:15,719
He is always in the kitchen. 

2527
02:14:16,340 --> 02:14:18,460
She cooks in the kitchen. 

2528
02:14:41,900 --> 02:14:44,299
Could you take a look at the problems you opened for us? 

2529
02:14:47,320 --> 02:14:48,320
What would you say? 

2530
02:14:48,380 --> 02:14:49,480
Bahar, of course. 

2531
02:14:50,060 --> 02:14:51,980
So this girl has a mental illness. 

2532
02:14:52,180 --> 02:14:53,800
I don't know if it's crazy. 

2533
02:14:54,100 --> 02:14:55,740
Are we going to talk about her again? 

2534
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:57,960
Why can't we talk about both of them? 

2535
02:14:58,260 --> 02:14:59,260
Look, I'll tell you. 

2536
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:00,960
Look, do you know what this is? 

2537
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:03,320
This is me. Yasemin baby. Well? 

2538
02:15:03,660 --> 02:15:04,700
I am standing in the kitchen. 

2539
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:06,860
Where are you. You know? 

2540
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:08,900
In Ece's room ... 

2541
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:10,600
... with Bahar ... 

2542
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:12,460
... at the head of the sleeping Ece. 

2543
02:15:13,380 --> 02:15:14,020
Do you get it? 

2544
02:15:14,300 --> 02:15:16,460
Look at the game he had with the boy. 

2545
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:17,760
Can you believe it?

2546
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:19,980
So he wants to send me out of this house. 

2547
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:21,839
He wants to replace me. 

2548
02:15:22,700 --> 02:15:23,700
Yasemin ... 

2549
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,260
... are you aware of what you're saying? 

2550
02:15:26,820 --> 02:15:27,880
A toy in your hand. 

2551
02:15:28,400 --> 02:15:29,540
Ece's toy ... 

2552
02:15:29,800 --> 02:15:31,220
The boy is playing with it. 

2553
02:15:31,900 --> 02:15:33,040
Murat, you are naive. 

2554
02:15:33,720 --> 02:15:35,080
Or are you doing the naive trick. 

2555
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:37,700
Or I do not know. Maybe you two are close. 

2556
02:15:38,600 --> 02:15:41,140
That's enough. Enough is enough, Yasemin. 

2557
02:15:41,860 --> 02:15:43,200
Enough. I'm coming. 

2558
02:15:43,820 --> 02:15:45,540
You started to go crazy. 

2559
02:15:46,260 --> 02:15:48,440
I think the best way is to leave Murat's house. 

2560
02:15:57,300 --> 02:15:58,300
Yes? 

2561
02:15:58,760 --> 02:15:59,760
In my opinion ... 

2562
02:16:00,200 --> 02:16:01,480
... you better get out of the house. 

2563
02:16:03,380 --> 02:16:04,480
Gather your luggage. 

2564
02:16:05,020 --> 02:16:06,020
Go home. 

2565
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:22,440
If your wife ... 

2566
02:16:22,500 --> 02:16:24,460
... don't worry if she fired him from home.

2567
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:33,920
You've been waiting for someone else, right? 

2568
02:16:35,980 --> 02:16:38,240
But I'm here, daddy. 

2569
02:16:51,879 --> 02:16:53,319
You are also your mother's daughter. 

2570
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:54,860
You are looking for troubles. 

2571
02:16:58,520 --> 02:17:01,440
Yes. You better get out of this house. 

2572
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:03,420
Because unless you get out of this house ... 

2573
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:06,260
... we will never get rid of this girl. Well? 

2574
02:17:06,840 --> 02:17:08,460
This girl won't leave us alone. 

2575
02:17:09,080 --> 02:17:10,559
I am not your problem. 

2576
02:17:11,299 --> 02:17:13,139
I am an extra in your war. 

2577
02:17:13,340 --> 02:17:14,500
You haven't thought of me. 

2578
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:17,880
It is not mine. But you are that girl's problem, Murat. 

2579
02:17:18,459 --> 02:17:20,119
And it will never leave us alone. 

2580
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:23,740
Take a look at what I am right now? 

2581
02:17:23,959 --> 02:17:25,339
You even turned your back on me. 

2582
02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:28,500
You just fired me from the house. Are you warned? 

2583
02:17:29,138 --> 02:17:30,458
I think you wanted to go. 

2584
02:17:31,400 --> 02:17:33,020
I gave you an excuse.

2585
02:17:33,620 --> 02:17:35,680
Now go comfortably. 

2586
02:17:36,260 --> 02:17:37,260
Well. 

2587
02:17:37,900 --> 02:17:38,900
Well. 

2588
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:40,539
Let it be what you want. 

2589
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:42,619
As you want it ... 

2590
02:17:42,980 --> 02:17:43,980
... so be it. 

2591
02:17:45,320 --> 02:17:47,039
But know that this is not my wish. 

2592
02:17:49,558 --> 02:17:51,739
I wouldn't want to leave this house like this, Yasemin. 

2593
02:17:52,660 --> 02:17:53,660
It never is. 

2594
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:56,160
It shouldn't have been like that. 

2595
02:17:57,480 --> 02:18:00,039
It is too late to do what we want now. 

2596
02:18:03,379 --> 02:18:04,379
I'm telling you ... 

2597
02:18:04,780 --> 02:18:06,740
... let me help you pack your things. 

2598
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:17,559
I said you would do what I tell you. 

2599
02:19:18,820 --> 02:19:21,100
I said you won't get off my word 

2600
02:19:22,280 --> 02:19:23,840
Don't bring me here again. 

2601
02:19:24,280 --> 02:19:25,820
I said you would stay in my hand 

2602
02:19:27,100 --> 02:19:30,580
I said life *** to ruin my life. 

2603
02:19:31,540 --> 02:19:33,220
You tried to hit the man without the genie. 

2604
02:19:34,620 --> 02:19:35,620
Does it work like this? 

2605
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:22,580
It doesn't have to be this way, Yasemin.

2606
02:20:25,820 --> 02:20:26,820
Goodbye Murat. 

2607
02:20:34,260 --> 02:20:35,420
Look, there is no going back.
