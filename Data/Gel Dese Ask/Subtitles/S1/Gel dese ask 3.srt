1
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,860
Room service came for sure. 

2
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,750
Get orange juice ... 

3
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,540
Yasemin? 

4
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,010
Well ... it's 

5
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,000
actually time to talk. 

6
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,440
Yasemin I know how it looks. But make sure ... But make 

7
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,080
sure, it's not, it's not what it seems. 

8
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
So nothing is really how you know it. 

9
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,580
You know, I was trying to tell you. I was going to tell you, Yasemin. 

10
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:37,980
Shall we go down a bit? 

11
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,980
You want? 

12
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,790
I'm going to say something. Come in if you want, let's talk like this. This place looks ridiculous. 

13
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,790
Will you shut up, please? 

14
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,270
What did I say? 

15
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,490
I said let's talk. 

16
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:04,430
Derin. 

17
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:04,930
... Is everything okay? ... 

18
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,350
... Lamb? My mom, my sister is sleeping. 

19
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,350
I scream, I scream ... 

20
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,170
... it doesn't sound. I'm very ...

21
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,230
Scared. 

22
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,470
- Okay, mom. All right, Ece. Do not be afraid! - What happened? 

23
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,960
- Okay mom? I'm coming now. - What happened? - Do not be afraid! 

24
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,390
- Don't hang up the phone, okay? - He still hasn't woken up, Mom. 

25
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,810
- Well done, well, well, est ... - Yasemin, did something happen to the children? What happened? 

26
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,490
As if he cares so much! 

27
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,850
- I care, of course, they are my children. - My dear. Well well. 

28
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,270
- What happened, Murat? Is there something wrong? - I don't know, I'll let you know. 

29
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,890
- Yasemin. - It's okay, Ece, dear. Look, don't be afraid. 

30
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,210
Your sister slept deep. You have become a huge girl, my dear. 

31
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,170
Yasemin. Come on, let's go with my car.

32
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,140
- Look, let's go in the car, please! "I'm not going anywhere with you, Murat!" Leave me alone! 

33
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:11,530
Look, please, we are in a difficult situation. Our children are there. This is not the time to fight. Would you ride it, please? 

34
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,220
Yasemin, they are my children too. Look, he's going to fight now ... 

35
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,130
... not us. Please! Please let me go together. We'll talk later. 

36
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,240
Okay, I'll continue, okay. Please! 

37
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,150
You have a lot of persuasion! 

38
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,680
It lowered the woman a lot! 

39
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,810
Anyway. 

40
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,070
Let's see what it had to do with it. 

41
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,630
Room Service. 

42
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,530
Just in time. 

43
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,500
Ece'cig ... 

44
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,140
... My dear. Never fear! Get out of the room. Trust me. 

45
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,530
Nothing will happen to your sister. Well?

46
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,190
Just a little tired. It's OK darling? Girl, come on, baby. Ece calm down ... 

47
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,680
- ... dear, okay? - Murat, get out of here, what would you be? 

48
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,690
What would you be 

49
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
How can you do this to me? 

50
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,810
How do you do it? Well done mom. Well done dear. 

51
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:53,370
- Yasemin, Yasemin, I'm sorry! - Do not do! Don't do this to me, Murat! Do not do this to me! 

52
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,650
Well done, I am one. Well done dear. 

53
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,050
"If I were you, I'd act first. 

54
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,750
If you get what you can ... 

55
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,970
... you're not for me anymore." 

56
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,190
You feel good. Don't be naughty, okay? 

57
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,090
No mom. No mom. Get out of the room, okay? I'm coming soon. 

58
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:53,890
Well. 

59
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,870
Ece, let's go. 

60
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,790
- Murat, look ahead, what's wrong? - I'm looking forward.

61
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,610
- What are you doing Murat? - I'm looking for an ambulance, I can't step on it. Please take it, I'm driving! 

62
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,890
- So you're angry. - Honey ... 

63
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:15,490
Look, your dad will talk, Mommy. It's okay. Well well. I gave it my dear. 

64
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,640
My dear daughter. Do not hang up the phone! We are coming, we are on our way, my dear. 

65
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,960
Is it alright my dear? Calm down, calm down my beautiful love. 

66
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,810
- Calm down. - Hello? 

67
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:32,050
Well, you need an ambulance. Urgently, my daughter fainted. 

68
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:37,570
No, no, I don't know what happens. I'm not at home, she's with her little sister. 

69
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,410
Derin? My Ece! 

70
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,530
We'll see the patient for a second. 

71
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,670
- My daughter. - What happens? 

72
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,210
- Miss, are you okay? Sir, wait a second. - The pulse?

73
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,530
- Pulse, calm down, sir. - Look at your pulse again. 

74
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,450
Sir, the pulse is good. I am sorry. Bring a stretcher. 

75
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:40,929
- I called but he didn't hear me. - Oh my God, well done! No, nothing, look. 

76
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:45,370
Isn't that Murat? It'll be good. My dear. Good for you. 

77
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,210
There is nothing, girl. Come let me look, let me look, sit like this. 

78
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:58,490
Oh my lamb! How beautiful you looked, you reported. Good for you dear. What happens? 

79
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,450
- Loss of consciousness. Get clear information from the hospital. - Well. 

80
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,220
- Can we go with you? - Better if you follow me. 

81
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,460
Ah okay! We will come from behind. 

82
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,960
- Come on Murat. - The coat? - Down, let's go! 

83
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,070
Derin? 

84
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,930
Ah okay. 

85
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,210
Why hasn't he come back yet? 

86
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,990
The doctor will respond more clearly.

87
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,960
Is my sister sick? 

88
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,419
No lamb, no. OMG! 

89
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,400
- What is the patient's condition? - Loss of consciousness. Your blood pressure is high. Nine sixteen. 

90
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,470
- There are signs of dehydration. - How was it? 

91
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,060
We do not know. We weren't at home. 

92
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,960
A medication that we do not know, illness, etc.? 

93
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
No, there is no medication. 

94
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,180
So what is this smell? Drank? 

95
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,530
I do not know. 

96
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,760
Let's get the patient inside. 

97
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,870
Take blood pressure, blood count, tomography of the patient. 

98
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,379
Get three. Faster Faster! 

99
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,550
Come, my lamb, come. 

100
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,420
Come my love, come. 

101
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,640
Moron! 

102
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,190
You can't do this to me! 

103
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,140
You can't do this to me ... 

104
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,110
... not Murat. 

105
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,400
Yasemin, look.

106
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,560
- I want to talk. - The doctor is here. 

107
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,240
- Doctor. - Alcohol related toxicity occurred. 

108
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,560
- We washed his stomach. - Is it alcohol? 

109
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,420
Drank? 

110
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,640
... eat alcohol. But do not worry. 

111
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,150
He is fine now. We have done everything necessary. 

112
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,630
We are entering your room right now. 

113
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,860
You will rest for a few hours and will be discharged. 

114
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,740
Nothing, huh, doctor? 

115
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,470
It's OK now. Just get some rest. 

116
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,810
- Thanks. - Get well soon. 

117
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,590
How? So much to go into an alcohol coma like this? 

118
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,970
How did I skip this? This child is turning into this ... 

119
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,210
- How can I not see this? - Yasemin, it's okay. 

120
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,510
Do not be so hard on yourself. Little boy. 

121
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,510
Shouldn't it charge?

122
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,010
Murat, are you aware? We are in the hospital now. 

123
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,050
- Okay, nothing. - God bless ... 

124
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,610
... something could happen to our daughter. 

125
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,900
Who am I talking to? 

126
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,560
Isn't it all because of your indifference? 

127
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,110
Insult and belittle my concerns ... 

128
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,170
... not your indifference? 

129
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,850
You exaggerated, you said you said you stopped! 

130
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,110
Take a look, where are we? I wish you too ... 

131
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,220
- ... you were a little over the top with me. - Did all this happen because I did not exaggerate? 

132
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,950
That's the problem? Murat, what are you saying? 

133
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,610
what do you mean? That's! 

134
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,250
I do not know. You say. Are you mad at me for this? 

135
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,980
Or why are you so mad at me? 

136
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,320
Why don't we tell the truth?

137
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,530
Why don't we talk tonight? 

138
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,490
Why not talk about what you saw in that hotel room? 

139
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,640
- What? - Do not do it! Do not do this! 

140
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,800
Ece is sleeping there. Do it with you at the hospital right now ... 

141
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,970
Of course I won't talk. 

142
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,330
Of course you will not speak. 

143
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,950
We will talk. 

144
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,550
Do not do this to me! 

145
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,500
Don't do this to me, Murat! 

146
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,739
Do not do this to me! Do not do this to me! Do not do this to me! 

147
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:17,299
I'll make you pay for this! I'll make you pay for this! I will pay for this! You will realize this! I'll make you pay! 

148
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,379
You will regret, you will regret. 

149
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,120
Okay, I know you won't talk. But I will speak. 

150
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,960
Please, Yasemin. Look, you have to listen to me. 

151
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,390
Before you blame me like this ... 

152
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,980
... you have to listen.

153
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,360
Look Yasemin. For a long time ... 

154
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,630
... because you are away from me, myself ... 

155
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,090
I was feeling lonely. 

156
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,970
Everything looked beautiful from the outside, but it wasn't really good at all. 

157
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
You know it too. 

158
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,940
Yasemin has grown inside of me over time. 

159
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,040
You never got close to me. 

160
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,890
You wouldn't let me get close to you, Yasemin. 

161
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,180
One minute, one minute, one minute. 

162
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,600
Am I guilty of cheating? 

163
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,010
Never! I do not want to say that. I was telling you what's inside. 

164
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,740
No, since I said ... 

165
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,450
... my mistakes, the bad things I did against you ... 

166
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,730
... you keep counting, I think. 

167
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,060
I never meant to say that! I'm telling you what's inside

168
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:40,660
- Why don't you want to listen to me somehow? - Murat! Because these are all excuses. This ... 

169
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,690
... what you're saying is false. 

170
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
A bundle of lies? 

171
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,250
What I say are my feelings. 

172
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,180
I feel like that! 

173
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,680
We take our patient to the room. You can see if you want. 

174
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,630
Thanks. Here you have. Ok I'm on my way. 

175
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,910
Murat. Get Ece and the bag. 

176
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,620
I'm taking it, darling. 

177
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,050
My daughter? 

178
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,299
My daughter, come the sister woke up, sister woke up. 

179
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,210
Oh my beautiful daughter, my dear daughter. 

180
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,790
Here. Number nine. Here you are. 

181
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,690
Thanks. 

182
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,660
Children don't know anything. 

183
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,870
We were so scared, Mom! 

184
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,390
But what did you do? How scared we were!

185
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,950
My only. How scared ... 

186
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,240
- ... Ece was. - I am sorry. 

187
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,990
Irresponsibility, but this is it. We trust you. 

188
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,140
We left his brother. What if something happens to you? 

189
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,100
We go out with your father! 

190
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,640
Are you better dear? 

191
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,320
... Thanks god. 

192
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,250
Did you sleep with your sister? 

193
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,690
Yes my sister. I am sorry. 

194
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,609
I called my mom. Spoke to me. 

195
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,099
Because I cried a lot. 

196
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,500
My daughter, everything is fine now. Look, your sister is fine. 

197
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,680
Very good. 

198
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,220
What's on your arm? Serum. 

199
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,480
They also wore me. Isn't it mom? 

200
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,920
Yes my mom. They also brought it to you. 

201
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:24,479
- Did you get very sick, sister? - Not! 

202
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,010
I'm fine, my lamb. Do not worry.

203
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,310
I also ruined your romantic evening. So sorry! 

204
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,520
Not you, my dear, not you. 

205
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,460
I will take care of the payment process. 

206
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,580
Lady? 

207
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,890
Ma'am, can you open the door? 

208
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,980
Lady? 

209
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,320
Ma'am, are you okay? 

210
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,030
I am not. 

211
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
I am not fine at all. 

212
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,190
Call me a taxi. 

213
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,660
My mom. Ok, I'm fine! I can walk alone. 

214
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,960
You came here by ambulance, my lamb. 

215
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,580
Your father opened, come on. 

216
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,720
Go. 

217
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,220
One minute. 

218
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,450
- My daughter, may you get well soon, dear. - Thanks Dad. 

219
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,220
- Good night darling. - Good night. 

220
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,990
Mom, it's okay. I'm good. Thanks. 

221
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,340
It is intertwined. - What are they? 

222
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,170
So pain relief. Well ... I ...

223
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,260
... my head hurt a lot. Of course ... 

224
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,220
- ... I leaked before assigning. - Ay Derin? 

225
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,480
My mother! What happens Look, you opened your eyes again. 

226
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,210
I drank, I got drunk. I am sorry. 

227
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,790
I fainted because my body is not durable. 

228
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,510
But it will never happen again. I promise! 

229
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,860
Sight! Grow and dramatize everything. But I am overwhelmed. 

230
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,860
Please! 

231
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,840
Ok, now you sleep, rest. 

232
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,050
We will talk later, but this topic. Here ... 

233
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,350
... this problem is not closed. 

234
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,660
Well. 

235
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,690
Good night. 

236
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,610
Yasemin. 

237
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,810
Actually, it was time we talked. 

238
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,280
Yasemin. I know how it looks. 

239
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,130
But be sure, it is not. It's not what it seems. So nothing is really how you know it.

240
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,240
You know I was trying to tell you. I was going to tell you, Yasemin. 

241
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,160
Shall we go down a bit? We can talk? You want? 

242
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:28,000
- Yasemin. - Don't waste your breath, Murat! 

243
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,980
While I was trapped in Derin there two days ago ... 

244
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,590
... this subject here with you ... 

245
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,530
... I won't speak. All these things ... 

246
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,230
we should ignore ... 

247
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,290
Do we tell ourselves the lies we tell our children, Yasemin? How it will be? 

248
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:51,339
Not! But for the goodness of our children we will hold back, Murat. Ourselves. 

249
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,500
We will act like adults! 

250
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,810
- Good Morning. - Good Morning. 

251
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,300
- Good Morning. - My dear daughter? - Good morning Dad. 

252
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,730
- Good morning dear. - You're drinking tea, right? - Oh please. 

253
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,120
Daddy? Can you convince my mom?

254
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,890
- Because? What happened to my daughter? - Because I'm fine. 

255
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,140
I can go to school, I say. But it does not allow it. 

256
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:13,290
What your mother says is my daughter. I can not do anything. 

257
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,260
According to the plan of throwing us at each other, falls into the water ... 

258
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,530
... take your omelette. 

259
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,740
Eat. Murat, omelette? 

260
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,470
- Please. My daughter, can you give me? - Comadamente. 

261
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,590
What am I going to do at home all day? 

262
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,390
- I'm going to explode with boredom. - Ece, dear, look ... 

263
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,500
- .. all the cheese will be finished, lamb, come on. - You should eat it my father. 

264
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,920
Ece'cig. You have become a huge girl. 

265
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,750
You can eat it yourself. No way. Go. 

266
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,730
My mom? 

267
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:55,730
If I arrive early? Sight! I have a lesson in harmony.

268
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,790
If I don't go, then the teacher uses those things! 

269
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,740
Derin. No. You have a report. 

270
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,720
No one can say anything at this time. 

271
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,380
When I come from school, my sister Bahar will come. 

272
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,870
He plays with you. You never get bored. 

273
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
Isn't it mom? 

274
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,390
Mutton. Bahar's sister quit her job. It will no longer come. 

275
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,400
Why is that? 

276
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,000
True mother. Didn't he say anything? 

277
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,550
He had another important job. 

278
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,970
But I miss it. Come to see us. 

279
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,470
I'll call her today. 

280
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,040
I asked. Let's see what matters. 

281
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,779
- ... back again? - Super! Super! 

282
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,880
- What happened? - I'm going to work, girl. I'm late. See you later. 

283
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,770
- I'm also under tea. - C'mon darling. 

284
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:54,770
Take care of yourself. 

285
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,390
That's enough.

286
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,940
Barlas Bey does not eat bread. You do not know? 

287
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,050
I'm sorry Mr. 

288
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,240
- Good Morning! - Good morning honey. 

289
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,120
Thanks. 

290
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,460
What have you done Are your plans for war ready? 

291
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,140
I'm preparing. 

292
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,050
So have you set a location? What work will you do? 

293
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,530
- I do not know. Maybe I'll take your job. - Is that so? 

294
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:47,370
You know, you work late at night. Maybe it will help. 

295
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:52,050
Is the horn in your ear, Sitare? 

296
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,200
Making use of your experience for Onur ... 

297
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,200
... is a great opportunity darling. 

298
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,170
Here you have. 

299
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:06,180
I had a terrible night. They took me to the hospital. I am now under house arrest. 

300
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,410
What did that stupid drug do to my head? 

301
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,890
We go up to ten minutes.

302
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,540
You go anyway. I have several jobs. I see you mom. 

303
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,859
- Mommy? - Air kiss, don't forget. 

304
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,870
Ah, mother. 

305
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,360
A goal in minutes. Here's your son. 

306
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,680
"My beautiful son, my dear son." 

307
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,960
Sitare is loosening up from day one. 

308
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,950
Look at your son. But the language is as much as you say. 

309
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,830
Would you have breakfast without bread? 

310
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,340
What's going on? 

311
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,300
I am sorry. 

312
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,199
I didn't get a chance to call. Last night ... 

313
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,939
- I don't even matter, do I? - You do. 

314
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:53,549
Because nobody cares what Bahar ... 

315
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,550
... happens to him. 

316
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,790
You left me like shit. 

317
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,280
When I called you, you didn't open it. Until this time ... 

318
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,330
... I didn't even think about it! 

319
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,860
It does not even matter! 

320
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,750
I think you do now you know

321
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,250
Go away! 

322
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,770
Decide what you want to do first. 

323
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,570
Because I'm so sorry. 

324
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:18,510
- Do you understand? - Yes. - I ... 

325
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,570
- ... I'm so sorry. - Bahar? 

326
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,700
Please open the door. Let me explain what it is about. 

327
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,120
Bahar was a bad thing yesterday. Derin was in very bad shape. 

328
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:32,310
We took him to the hospital. I waited all night. 

329
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,370
I also didn't get a chance to call. 

330
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Go down? 

331
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,560
So sorry. You are right. I just left you there and left. 

332
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,670
Bahar? 

333
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,600
Are you going to open the door? We cannot handle such a thing. 

334
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,980
Sight! The first chance I got, I jumped up and came. 

335
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,520
To tell you what happened. 

336
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,660
I couldn't talk to Yasemin. I can not speak. 

337
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,450
Or to recover the situation after yesterday ...

338
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,380
... I'm trying. So don't be mad. 

339
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,140
So that Yasemin wouldn't get mad. So nobody is upset, Bahar! 

340
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,470
My daughter really got sick. When he said it was an ambulance, it was a hospital ... 

341
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,360
... I couldn't call. 

342
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,240
Bahar, will you open the door? 

343
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
Can you open the door please? 

344
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,750
Damn! 

345
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,070
Curse! 

346
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,970
- Onur? - Hello Aunt Yasemin. 

347
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,020
I came to see Derin. 

348
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,550
Is that so? 

349
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,980
What did you do right 

350
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,260
He will be very happy seeing you. Come. 

351
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,300
Derin? Look ... 

352
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,160
- ... Onur came to see you. - I know mom. 

353
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,320
- We talk in the morning. - Oh, is that so? 

354
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,400
- How are your parents Onur? - They're good, they're good. 

355
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,880
How good that you came. I'm going to get my car.

356
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,000
- My eyes won't be back now. - Where's your car? 

357
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,190
I'll tell you. Come on, let's go out. 

358
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,610
- See you mom. - See you later. 

359
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,340
Mrs. Filiz? 

360
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:24,570
I'm going to get my car. Whatever happens, keep an eye on Derin. 

361
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,290
- You know. - Don't worry ... 

362
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:29,500
... Mrs. Yasemin. I got it. Do it comfortably. 

363
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,390
- ... your work. - OK thank you. 

364
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,390
Children are entrusted to me. 

365
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,550
No I do not understand! How? These drugs will give you ... 

366
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,470
How can he touch it? That's fair for me ... 

367
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,880
... to count. Did they tell you something at the hospital? This ... 

368
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,840
... is it normal? No, if it's not normal ... 

369
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,230
Let's call the doctor. Let's say: like this. 

370
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,450
The medicines you gave us touched us. 

371
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,390
Well, I mean, medicine, ... 

372
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,860
doctor ...

373
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,590
What?! What does Derin doubt? Tell me. 

374
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,530
Onur, yesterday I had a glass of drink. 

375
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,600
They touched him when he took the medicine. 

376
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,670
But how do I know? So it's ridiculous. 

377
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,380
Did the doctor tell us something like this? I do not remember. 

378
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,430
Otherwise my mother saw the medication. 

379
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,770
- So what did you say to your mother? - I said pain relief, of course. 

380
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,880
I said I didn't take it. Then I threw it all away. 

381
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:38,050
If you tried to tell the truth, Derin. 

382
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,110
Impossible, Onur! While the tension between them is so tense ... 

383
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,840
... I don't live! They both take my nerves away. 

384
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,150
- What tension? - I said, either, it's not good. 

385
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,970
No, I thought this weekend getaway would be good ... 

386
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,890
... I got it on my face.

387
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,790
So my mom goes to the hotel to take her car. 

388
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,140
Ece looked for my parents when he saw me here. 

389
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,660
They hurriedly came with my father's car. 

390
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,270
It's a total disgrace, so you'll understand! So my mom is taking medicine ... 

391
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:06,210
... if she learns, she'll get cold! 

392
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,110
So now is not the right time! Onur, please look! Anyway ... 

393
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,550
- ... don't say ok? We can't hug my mother. - Well. 

394
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,750
I will not say. 

395
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,140
So it's still broken. 

396
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:20,840
Do not ask. There is a strange tension. 

397
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,860
No, they think they didn't show us either. But ... 

398
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,860
don't they say anything? 

399
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:29,260
No, why did you put it so much on this topic? 

400
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,740
- You know something, right? - No dear, what does that have to do with it?

401
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,800
You always get along ... 

402
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,720
I'm in awe of that. 

403
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,670
My mother and getting along. 

404
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,360
- Anyway. Change the topic. - What topic? 

405
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,680
It is a question of drinking. 

406
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:47,910
Come! 

407
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,550
Do you drink something? Tea coffee? 

408
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,410
I can have a coffee. 

409
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:57,070
I am preparing sister Filiz. Do not bother yourself. 

410
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,240
I am arriving right now. 

411
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,140
We can talk at lunch. 

412
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,770
I can come to you. 

413
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,670
I'm waiting. 

414
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,640
What happens? Are you okay? 

415
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,610
My daughter, don't ask! Very bad things happened. 

416
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,880
So it is complicated. 

417
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,060
What happened? 

418
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,450
The doctor gave me antidepressants. 

419
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,560
Here I was wrong when I took the medicine and the drink together. 

420
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,410
Then Ece arrived. He tried to wake me up.

421
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,630
We cried, we cried, my parents called. 

422
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,620
They rush to the hospital. 

423
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,410
I opened my eyes. Serum or something. I mean misfortune. 

424
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,110
It was pretty bad. 

425
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,490
That bad. Then? 

426
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,610
- Are you OK? - When 

427
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:36,480
I eat the serum ... ... of course I got up like a stapler. Remember. 

428
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,030
The man with the medicine is not taking the man. 

429
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,770
By the way, I was heading towards you. But my mother ... 

430
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,990
... forbade me to leave the house until a second request. 

431
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:55,950
Here's the classic drama queen Yasemin! 

432
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,320
By the way ... 

433
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,900
Onur is here! 

434
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,260
I was going to say come, but ... 

435
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,740
I guess my mom is a little mad at you. 

436
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,210
Why is that? 

437
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,740
- Said something? - Oh no. He said nothing.

438
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,930
How can I say? When your name is like this ... 

439
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:18,320
... my mother has a state of anger that she tries not to show us. 

440
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,040
Are. Frost! 

441
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,110
So you say goose bumps. 

442
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,390
Exactly. Or ... 

443
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:27,190
Ece loved you so much. 

444
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,150
I guess he got mad about quitting. 

445
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,620
I suppose. 

446
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,480
Whatever. Say goodbye 

447
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,030
... we can see any guy. 

448
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,350
Sure dear. 

449
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,330
Say hello to Onur. 

450
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,860
Well, he is here. Hey you say. 

451
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,850
Hello? Onur'cug. Hello. How are you? 

452
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,380
Well. 

453
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,860
That is good. 

454
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,230
Anyway, young people. Then I closed. 

455
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,060
Goodbye. Goodbye. 

456
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,640
I'm going to ask something. 

457
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,050
Do you really love Bahar? 

458
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,080
Yes! Why is that? 

459
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,350
Then...

460
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:10,120
... How should I know. After all, you are from different circles. 

461
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,030
She is also a girl who has passed through the circle of the angel. 

462
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:17,110
What does someone like you share with him? I am thinking about her. 

463
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:20,470
A girl who passed the angel circle? 

464
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,050
I've never heard anything so ridiculous in my life, Onur! 

465
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,090
And where did he come from now while he was standing? 

466
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:28,120
Didn't you introduce it to me? 

467
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,200
Since you have a friend, I think he can be my friend, right? 

468
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,510
Bahar is not my friend. 

469
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,440
So what? 

470
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,190
So ... 

471
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,890
Friend is something different for me. 

472
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,570
We only meet Bahar, that's all. 

473
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:47,070
Anyway. I just said my idea. You know. 

474
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,990
What is Onur? Why are you so angry now?

475
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,680
I have to go out. 

476
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,510
Well, you haven't had your coffee yet! 

477
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,210
I will see. 

478
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:19,560
Rude! Look at this! 

479
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,160
What madman came again, I wondered? 

480
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:07,820
I know you are home, Bahar. Open that door! 

481
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,600
I said open. 

482
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:10,870
Come! 

483
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,650
It was upstairs, I hadn't heard it. What the hell to eat ... 

484
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,650
... do you knock on the door? 

485
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,640
Not me dear. You tell these stories to others. 

486
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:33,490
I am standing, Onur. Here, sit down! 

487
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,880
Come here. 

488
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:45,470
Let me tell you up front if you have a long speech. 

489
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:48,160
I had a really bad night. My head hurts. 

490
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,250
- I'm not in the mood. - The man will get a divorce because of you! 

491
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:56,380
No, will he marry you later? Do you think it will be like this? 

492
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,380
Who?

493
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:00,900
- What divorce? - Don't fake me! 

494
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,080
I'm talking about the divorce you're working on. 

495
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,580
I couldn't understand which one he said because there were a few. 

496
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:19,030
- Are you talking about your mom and dad? - Bahar. 

497
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,750
Sight! Do not mess with me! Did you understand? 

498
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:23,950
Don't work according to your head! 

499
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,940
Otherwise I will regret you. 

500
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,580
I'm honored to be so scared right now ... 

501
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,920
... trust me, we don't have to talk. 

502
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,440
So I'm better off going horizontal. 

503
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,120
You know the location of the door. 

504
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,590
Uncle Murat ... 

505
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,960
Does he know you used it to get closer to my father? 

506
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,430
I do not believe it. 

507
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:10,170
He does not know. 

508
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,720
Because there is no such thing. 

509
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:18,630
Is that so? 

510
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:20,310
It is. 

511
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,670
So why are your fists clenched?

512
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,720
Your face is like paper. 

513
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,090
If you want to sit. 

514
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,150
There's no need. 

515
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,010
- Tea? - Tea. 

516
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,210
- Yes, Yasemin? - I came. 

517
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:54,440
I'm down here 

518
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:59,300
Well. Nobody ... 

519
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,040
- ... not here. We will talk here. - No no no. 

520
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:05,180
We can't be comfortable there now. 

521
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,490
I think you come here. 

522
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,960
Well. Come. 

523
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,070
Good now. 

524
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,760
If you continue my relationship with Murat now ... You 

525
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,320
threaten to tell him everything. 

526
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,080
I did it well? 

527
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:37,930
It is not exactly a threat. 

528
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,260
Just asking. Does he know he did it? 

529
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,340
See what he thought. I think go and say. 

530
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,610
Let it all come out. 

531
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,200
Who is my father ... 

532
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,940
... you know this relationship and you come to Derin ...

533
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,800
... you didn't even tell your dear Aunt Yasemin. 

534
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:04,990
Let all our dirty clothes be dumped! 

535
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,940
Okay for me. 

536
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,990
What you don't understand is this Onur'cuk: 

537
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,480
I have nothing to lose. 

538
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:30,150
But you have a lot to lose. 

539
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:51,530
Welcome. 

540
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:54,230
Thanks. Let's go to a quiet place where we can talk. 

541
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:56,860
I will follow you. 

542
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,090
Finally! 

543
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,080
What are you doing? 

544
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,950
What's going on? 

545
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:18,780
- What are you doing? - I broke the procedure, right? I am sorry. 

546
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,760
I've been thinking since yesterday, Yasemin. 

547
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,500
You came to the hotel last night. 

548
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,140
... it was the worst moment of my life. 

549
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,520
So blame ... 

550
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,260
I'm sorry I gave you something like this ...

551
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,990
I couldn't realize that I was sad because of the sadness I felt for ... 

552
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:35,970
I realized something. 

553
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,820
Because I couldn't see. 

554
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,660
We had such a thing. 

555
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:43,160
How can you wait until this time to speak? 

556
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,830
How can you stop? How? I can not understand. I do not mind. 

557
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:49,100
Yasemin, it's called maturity! 

558
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,810
This is officially insensitive, soulless! 

559
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,820
But are you the emotion boy, Murat? 

560
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,970
So you are in the vortex of your emotions. 

561
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,120
while pulling from there to there 

562
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,010
you also drag us. 

563
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:05,260
Wait. You know why? 

564
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,020
Because I'm not selfish like you. 

565
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:10,240
Do you think it is easy to wait? 

566
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:13,540
I am ruined. But unfortunately ... 

567
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,060
... being a parent, being an adult ...

568
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:17,240
- .. something like that. - Adult? 

569
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,220
Adult! 

570
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,610
It is understandable without even knowing the word. 

571
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:27,710
Sight! You see it? You do the same again! 

572
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:28,710
That is all you do. 

573
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:31,720
You do this so much Yasemin ... 

574
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,460
... such a step is retreating. "I'm fine like this, I'm fine like this ... 

575
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:37,070
... I'm so responsible, you're not an adult, ... 

576
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,990
... you're not mature. Once you understand me ... 

577
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,220
... can't we play according to my rules? 

578
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,970
Everything has to be what you want! 

579
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,020
We all have to be what you want, Yasemine! 

580
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,870
No! Let's play how you want. 

581
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:02,630
This time, let's do what you want. What do you want, ... 

582
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:05,600
... I don't understand! Example, let me enter the company, everyone in the office ... 

583
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,160
Should I yell at you?

584
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,660
Do you want this from me? 

585
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:12,400
Here it is! 

586
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,700
I wish you would scream, Yasemine. 

587
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:22,560
- I want you to scream! - What's up, Barlas? 

588
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,770
Well. You? 

589
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,980
Well. We work. You know. 

590
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:28,910
What happens? Did you come to chill your husband? 

591
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:31,620
It is not a good sign that you are coming here. 

592
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:33,130
God help me! 

593
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,550
No. I'll miss Murat for lunch. 

594
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:40,290
Food? Isn't it a little early? 

595
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:46,460
Come on, you're fine again. Taking your wife out to dinner. You tore. 

596
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:50,290
I'm not going to dinner. We are not going anywhere. 

597
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:53,650
Murat. We need to talk. You know. 

598
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,630
We don't have to do anything, Yasemin! 

599
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:58,970
We don't have to do anything. 

600
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:02,570
- See you later, Yasemin. - I will see. 

601
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,910
What's going on, Murat? 

602
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,570
Lemon situations?

603
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,070
You were just looking at the head. What happens? 

604
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,070
Nothing, Barlas. 

605
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:31,020
No. We will know if there is a situation. Maybe one of our benefits will touch, huh? 

606
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,260
Nothing. We argue a bit. 

607
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,920
You go on, brothers. All right, Barlas. 

608
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:51,510
I don't like this guy at all. It doesn't come from inside me. 

609
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,670
What does Aga work on? Why do you bet on each other? 

610
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:57,550
You got caught being a libertine, right? 

611
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:01,840
No. You are not the man who goes to wife and daughter. 

612
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,630
What did you do? Forgot to take out the trash tonight, huh? 

613
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,970
What! Oh laugh like that! Laughing at you is not appropriate either! 

614
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,440
These days are like this. 

615
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:13,540
What meeting were we going to have? Where are you? 

616
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:16,700
- Are you coming? - Hello Sadri Bey. - Hello everybody.

617
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,330
We were going to eat, dad. So we give up earlier. 

618
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:22,300
Well. You did it well. 

619
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:25,060
No, Mr. Bey? No. He didn't come. 

620
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,750
He doesn't open his phone either. 

621
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,550
From day one ... 

622
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,900
I'm in my room. You let me know 

623
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:35,150
Let it come, prince. We do the meeting. 

624
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:36,310
What is wrong with that? 

625
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:39,200
I did not understand! Again. I think he fought with his wife. 

626
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,510
Why? 

627
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,080
Murat says nothing. It is absolutely ridiculous. 

628
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,980
Exactly. 

629
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,980
- Anyway, I'll let you know when I see Onur, dad. - Well. 

630
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,930
Don't bother me with these things. 

631
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:57,010
- I already have a lot of work! I'll go out, go to the club. - Well well. 

632
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:59,840
- I'm on it. I'm even calling now. - Seeks! What the hell are you!

633
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,280
Not a company, the nursery is blessed! He turned to the nursery. 

634
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:09,960
I told you. 

635
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,130
I told you. 

636
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:14,790
You are not listening! 

637
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,180
It would be better if I stayed in the office tonight. 

638
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:59,050
I think this is the best. 

639
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,280
Well. 

640
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,100
You know. 

641
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,500
Excellent! 

642
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,200
It was literally great, dad. 

643
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:36,720
Flowers, candles. 

644
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:38,930
Murat is the heart of a woman ... 

645
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,410
... he knows how to take it. 

646
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,390
We had lots of fun! 

647
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:46,120
It sounded like medicine. 

648
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:53,170
Since we left Ece to Derin ... 

649
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,780
... our eyes are not far behind either. 

650
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:59,190
If you see Derin. 

651
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:03,100
How is she so responsible ... 

652
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,790
she became a thoughtful and wonderful young woman. 

653
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,300
In fact, if we go together for a weekend ...

654
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,240
... you love it too, I'm sure. 

655
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:46,140
We haven't been here much, but in the woods ... 

656
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,490
... a delightful place. 

657
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,770
We have to go back, Murat said. 

658
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,320
He too fainted. 

659
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,140
I guess it was good for both of us. 

660
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:58,730
I feel better too. 

661
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:00,270
More rested. Happier. Really. 

662
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:03,290
I'm so happy! 

663
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,170
Sometimes this should be a dream I think. 

664
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:17,180
I won't wait for you from morning to afternoon! 

665
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:20,420
- I have power! I'm going! - Ok dad. 

666
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:23,760
- I'll talk to him when he comes. - Well. Let's talk. 

667
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:25,930
I think it's early. 

668
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:28,690
He wants to work, but it's early. 

669
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,940
He is excited. 

670
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:31,670
Are you saying that? 

671
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:35,070
I think its purpose is not to work.

672
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:36,760
Provide some kind of status between friends. 

673
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:38,750
Are you busy? There is. 

674
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:41,200
Does anyone see your face when it comes to work? No. 

675
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,570
As if we see your face a lot! 

676
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:46,230
Don't get used to it, don't worry! It gets used like that. 

677
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:49,170
- Did I say why, Dad? - Put this in your mind ... 

678
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:51,680
Barlas, he's my heir! 

679
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:53,100
You are not! 

680
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,310
Come on thanks. 

681
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,080
Really? 

682
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:58,390
Yes. 

683
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:03,940
- Yes. Aydan? - What happen dear? - I'm good. 

684
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,170
Yasemin'cig. Did you have that singing girl? 

685
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,510
What was your name? 

686
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:10,390
Bahar. 

687
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:13,110
Can you send me your number? 

688
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,280
Why Aydan? 

689
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,390
I said let's arrange for souls to celebrate company. 

690
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:21,730
That day I had entertained everyone at your party.

691
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,590
Beautiful girl. Attractive ... 

692
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:25,210
... her voice is also pleasant. 

693
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:26,910
Then. 

694
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,130
What happened honey? You're sad? 

695
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:33,020
No. No. I'm a little tired. 

696
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,320
Rest my life, rest. 

697
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,190
Look, they say there is an epidemic. People at the hospital ... 

698
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:39,190
... waiting in line. 

699
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:42,900
- Good, Aydan. - So Bahar is home? 

700
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,800
- Give me the phone if you want, let me talk now. - I don't quit work. 

701
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,170
- Why is that? - I don't know Aydan! 

702
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:50,470
What happened? Is there a problem? 

703
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,140
Did the girl do something? 

704
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,520
Did I break the pot? 

705
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:58,120
No, I'm tired, I'm tired. We were at the hospital yesterday. 

706
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,370
Derin poisoned. 

707
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,290
Get well soon. 

708
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,040
Thanks. 

709
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:05,960
Anyway, I won't hold you back then.

710
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,100
It would be great if you sent me the girl's number. 

711
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,750
- Good, now I'm sending Aydan. - Thanks love. 

712
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:15,680
It was a great thing to find this Bahar! 

713
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:19,620
Do you bet? 

714
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,840
- Did you come? - I came. 

715
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,460
Filiz Hanımcığım, can you make me a simple Turkish coffee? 

716
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,460
Sure now. 

717
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:33,220
Thing? 

718
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,560
There is something I have to tell you! 

719
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:38,130
Tell. What happened? 

720
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:42,100
Ms. Yasemin, I overheard you on the phone to Derin. 

721
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,130
What did you hear, Filiz? Tell! 

722
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:49,030
Let's talk in the kitchen if you want. 

723
01:01:57,290 --> 01:01:58,680
Let me tell you something like coffee. 

724
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,820
You, sit down. 

725
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,240
I'm fine. You want? 

726
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:09,730
- Sit down. - I sat here. 

727
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:11,870
Look at me! 

728
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,450
You have everything in your eyes, right?

729
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:18,130
- It is very bad! I got so dirty! - Really? 

730
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,780
- Is it that bad? - Disastrous! 

731
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:22,870
Are you ready? 

732
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,730
- Yes. I'm listening. - Yasemin ... 

733
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:28,760
... Bahar and I in a hotel room ... trapped brother. 

734
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:35,790
How is that? 

735
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:40,230
Bahar has surprised me. I found a note. 

736
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:43,320
Waiting at this hotel right now. I went too. 

737
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:44,490
We were chatting. 

738
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:47,250
Everything was so beautiful. Then the door knocked. 

739
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:48,700
I opened a room service ... 

740
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:52,690
Yasemin. 

741
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,500
Misfortune! 

742
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,210
Then Ece called. 

743
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,740
Derin sick. The ambulance has arrived. 

744
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:09,770
When we said Derin to the hospital or something ... 

745
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:12,500
... we talked in the morning, but we couldn't.

746
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,090
We just couldn't talk in the parking lot and we got into each other. 

747
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:17,680
That's! 

748
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,090
So sorry. 

749
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,350
- It's very bad Murat. - You or I? 

750
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:28,150
Actually, I want to run and apologize. 

751
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:30,160
I want to tell everything but ... 

752
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,840
... we can't talk. Yasemin doesn't speak. 

753
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:36,250
Then. Isn't it normal, Murat? The woman is in shock! 

754
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:39,240
So how do we solve this without talking, brother? 

755
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:43,310
I want to take it and tell you everything, I tell you Ruhi! 

756
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:46,250
Ruhi, I fell in love with Bahar. I like! 

757
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:47,900
What I can do? 

758
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,340
But as long as I don't talk about it with Yasemin ... 

759
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:53,210
... I feel like I'm cheating. 

760
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:56,040
Look Ruhi I said once. I'll say fifty times! 

761
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,380
I loved Bahar, I love brother. Well?

762
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:02,270
This is so temporary, three days, four days ... 

763
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:05,190
It's not an adventure, Ruhi! 

764
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:08,660
Murat, dear, come slowly. What's going on? 

765
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,170
Why am I being slow? Look at me! Look at me! 

766
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:16,170
I feel like I have been living for the first time in many years! 

767
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:18,640
I started to enjoy life for the first time! 

768
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,280
I feel the sun, I feel nature. 

769
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,590
I see the city where I live and live, Ruhi! 

770
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:27,100
For years with Yasemin's authority, with her emotion ... 

771
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,800
... heals all her wounds. 

772
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:33,160
That is why I fell in love with Bahar! 

773
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,700
Well. Handsome. Well. 

774
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,730
- What about the sores you opened? - What wound? 

775
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:41,450
What wound have I opened for years? 

776
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:42,290
Yasemin ... 

777
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:45,290
Couldn't he be affected at all? 

778
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:47,430
Really ...

779
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:50,450
Does she feel nothing? 

780
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:51,610
So even with a little pain, huh? 

781
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:53,350
Of course he is sorry. 

782
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:56,470
But I think you are unfair to her. Look brother. 

783
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:57,900
Me? 

784
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,710
I will tell. 

785
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:01,640
You are being unfair. 

786
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:32,720
I got your number from Yasemin. I'm a friend. 

787
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,410
I would like to talk about a job. 

788
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:38,390
What are they doing? 

789
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:41,310
Will they offer money or something? 

790
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:43,300
How absurd! 

791
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:47,060
Trying to hug your friends in my head? I did not understand! 

792
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:55,460
What is it? 

793
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:58,470
Hi Bahar. I am Aydan. Yasemin's friend. I got your number from her. 

794
01:05:58,470 --> 01:05:59,470
Y? 

795
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:00,730
Well ... 

796
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:03,660
My husband's company is on the anniversary every year ... 

797
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:06,710
..it is celebrating. At this year's party ...

798
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:07,940
I thought you would go on stage. 

799
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:11,330
- Ms. Yasemin gave my number? - Yes. 

800
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:13,070
... Is there a problem? No. 

801
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:14,940
There is no problem. 

802
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:18,040
- It just surprised me. - I know, sugar. 

803
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,840
You are no longer working with them. But ... 

804
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,560
... I think it's perfect for our organization. 

805
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,360
I already told Yasemin. 

806
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,180
I don't think there is a problem. 

807
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:30,210
I think you thought it was great. 

808
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,320
On what dates? 

809
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:39,970
So ... How can I say that, Ms. Yasemin? 

810
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:40,970
Derin, to your friend ... 

811
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:44,300
... he said over the phone. 

812
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,520
Just because the drink doesn't kill the person. 

813
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:51,180
You're sure? I listened with my ears. 

814
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:53,870
So he actually said more of a joke but ... 

815
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:57,010
... I thought you'd better know it anyway.

816
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:05,130
What are they? 

817
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:09,490
So pain relief. Thing ... 

818
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:12,100
... my head hurt a lot ... 

819
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:13,790
Of course, I leaked before assigning. 

820
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:26,710
I can pass? 

821
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,250
You have already come. 

822
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,820
- Are you okay? - I'm good. Mother. 

823
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:41,940
Please. 

824
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,860
No ... I ... you know ... 

825
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,320
... I wanted to ask. 

826
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:49,400
You want to talk? 

827
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:53,330
- Really? - Yes. 

828
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,420
But we have to talk! 

829
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:58,820
Derin, my ... 

830
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,000
I have concerns. 

831
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:04,220
My mom! I am sorry. 

832
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:07,020
I had a drink even though I promised, I know. 

833
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:08,350
But it will never happen again! Agree? 

834
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:12,100
I don't want you to promise me, Derin. 

835
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:15,240
I want to be aware of your responsibilities. 

836
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,600
Look, you're not aware, but ... 

837
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,130
... you changed.

838
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:22,180
what do you mean? 

839
01:08:22,939 --> 01:08:26,049
So I want to say that we are together ... 

840
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:28,979
sometimes our friends ... 

841
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:31,659
... can negatively affect. 

842
01:08:31,689 --> 01:08:34,679
What friend of mine are you talking about? 

843
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,680
Is it from Onur? 

844
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:38,910
Nerd! I told him to give an example. 

845
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:40,890
So only. 

846
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:43,840
The people who came into our lives ... 

847
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,200
I'm talking about what changed us. 

848
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,640
My mom. What friend are you talking about? 

849
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,660
Can you say it openly? 

850
01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:55,370
Is it a problem with Bahar? 

851
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:00,429
What is this Bahar? Since the morning, every number, ... 

852
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:03,350
... of listening to Bahar in every conversation ... 

853
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:06,540
... I get sick! Who is this girl? 

854
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:10,159
Who is this Bahar? What is our deal with Bahar?

855
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:13,040
I don't understand that our lives are enough to confuse us ... 

856
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,779
What can I do with Bahar? What can you do with Bahar? 

857
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:18,409
Bahar is your equivalent? 

858
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:20,330
Oh God! 

859
01:09:20,979 --> 01:09:24,079
... this equivalence issue! What should I do? 

860
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,069
Mother, do I take the exam? They meet my high criteria, my family, ... 

861
01:09:27,069 --> 01:09:30,079
... to suit my location. Let me bring it up and then take the quiz! 

862
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,060
- Did I say Derin? - What are you saying? Mommy! 

863
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:36,390
What are you saying? You are the usual, but right? 

864
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:39,080
You always want everything to be what you want! Managing us all ... 

865
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,520
... you want to play with all of us! Once ... 

866
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,910
... once you understand me, according to my rules ... 

867
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:47,090
... if we play this game. No way, huh?

868
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:48,000
It always has to be what you want, but right? 

869
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:50,069
It always has to be what you want, but right? 

870
01:09:50,069 --> 01:09:51,069
Let everything be as you want! 

871
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:52,510
We all have to be what you want! 

872
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,560
Let's all be what you want! 

873
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:58,720
What did I do to you? 

874
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:01,800
What did I do to you? 

875
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:05,170
What if I'm breaking down 

876
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:06,170
What did I do to you? 

877
01:10:09,379 --> 01:10:11,139
What did I do to you? 

878
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:22,180
Mommy. 

879
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,450
Yes Aydan? 

880
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:48,880
Now I threw in Bahar's number. You call sometime. 

881
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:51,660
Why are you throwing me Bahar's number now? 

882
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:52,720
I do not understand. 

883
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,860
... for the company dinner. The girl was empty at the time. 

884
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:58,830
- You talk about other details. - What detail? 

885
01:10:58,830 --> 01:11:01,680
Ruhi so he can go on stage. Singing girl.

886
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,940
He appeared on the stage of Murat's birthday. 

887
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:05,370
Aydan ... 

888
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:07,940
... what are you doing according to your head if you ask me? 

889
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:11,310
I don't understand that either! 

890
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:14,690
- You said she was beautiful. - No, that girl. 

891
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:17,560
No way! Lets talk later. I have a job. 

892
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:19,660
Go. Well. 

893
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:24,920
I guess something has happened. 

894
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:27,070
Why is he so angry? 

895
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:29,120
It broke a lot. 

896
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,080
Hearing Bahar's name is freaking out today. 

897
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:36,760
They know. After all we ... 

898
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:39,250
... made our offer. I think it was a very good idea. 

899
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:40,430
I agree. 

900
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:45,560
There must be a problem with the girl. Why did he 

901
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,970
leave ... ... from Yasemin? 

902
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,300
Do you know something? 

903
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:00,880
No. Who knows?

904
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:04,260
... I have to go to the company, honey. 

905
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:05,650
I will take care of my son. 

906
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:07,860
They never get along with Barlas. 

907
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:11,290
Let me look up a situation, but you must not put each other, father and son. 

908
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:14,860
Well. I'll go to my date too. I wait a bit there. 

909
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:19,930
- Thank you. you waited with me. - Oh honey! 

910
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,600
Kiss, goodbye. 

911
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Account, please? 

912
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:38,530
I've been waiting in the meeting room for two hours. What is there, what is salient! 

913
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:40,900
I asked my grandfather, "Where?" is already out. 

914
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:43,330
Murat's brother doesn't know the world anyway! 

915
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,640
You got them caught up in these ridiculous reports, I've been analyzing them for two hours. 

916
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,690
These are last year's reports! 

917
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:53,180
What are you trying to do?

918
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:56,560
I'm trying to work, boy, but you're like this ... 

919
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,210
... how do I do it? 

920
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,900
These high school jokes aren't yours? 

921
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:07,540
Let me tell you if you are trying to intimidate me with this. Not that way! 

922
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:09,660
You need to find something more solid. 

923
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:13,050
Well, that's it son. If you don't like it, go out with your friends. 

924
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:16,870
This company works like this. 

925
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:18,660
I do not go anywhere. 

926
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,590
But I think you take care of yourself! 

927
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:29,660
Eşoğlueşek. 

928
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:44,310
- Sister Filiz? Where is my mom? - In the garden. 

929
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:45,310
Derin? 

930
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,500
I don't think you check it now. Morale is very bad. 

931
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,380
Let's calm down a bit. Come on, huh? 

932
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:00,370
Well, it's too cold. 

933
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,030
But I don't think I'm cold right now. 

934
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:18,570
Welcome ma'am. 

935
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:40,750
Welcome Mrs. Sitare.

936
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:52,960
What did you mean that night? 

937
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,180
It is not so difficult to understand. 

938
01:14:58,210 --> 01:15:00,800
You can never replace Yasemin! 

939
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:07,500
What are you waiting for? 

940
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,850
Do you think Murat and Yasemin will marry you? 

941
01:15:12,770 --> 01:15:13,810
Look darling. 

942
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:16,760
These guys are occasionally ... 

943
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:19,260
... can eat fast food. But ... 

944
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:21,240
... finally ... 

945
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:23,840
... he will go home. 

946
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:26,740
Because they are used to home cooking. 

947
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,400
Actually, that's what they want. 

948
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,330
You just ... 

949
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:33,420
... how to put it? 

950
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:36,580
So ... 

951
01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:39,140
Understand. 

952
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,600
You are a lover, darling. 

953
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:44,340
Unfortunately, it will continue to be. 

954
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:47,130
I recommend you ... 

955
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:50,020
On the baby's lap ... 

956
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:52,430
... all alone ...

957
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:56,380
... if you don't want to cry in a damn house ... 

958
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:59,620
... blow your mind ASAP. 

959
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:06,380
This is not the right place to hunt, honey. 

960
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:09,240
You will be lost. 

961
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:36,860
It was the baby in her arms! 

962
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:41,190
You will see that baby! 

963
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:45,970
I'm not my mother, Mrs. Sitare. 

964
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:49,570
Everyone will see this! 

965
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:52,970
All of you! 

966
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:05,340
- Father? - My beautiful daughter? 

967
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:08,270
- Don't be late at night! - What? 

968
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:11,090
I say late. Don't be late at night! I will cook. 

969
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:12,870
- You? - Yes! 

970
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:15,580
I put together a big menu ... 

971
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:19,930
... no dessert. It would be great if you get dessert while you come. 

972
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:22,420
Well, my daughter is fine. I'll get one, okay. 

973
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,250
- Good, see you. - Goodbye. 

974
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:34,520
I came. 

975
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:36,700
Hi Yasemin.

976
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:38,640
If Murat? 

977
01:17:39,190 --> 01:17:40,190
He just called Derin. 

978
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:43,940
I'll cook in the evening. "Come," he said. 

979
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:48,900
- I couldn't say I'll sleep in the office. - I'm not aware of that. 

980
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:52,340
- Are you ... aren't you at home? - I'm not at home. 

981
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:55,360
I'm at home, but this dish ... 

982
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,850
... has nothing to do with me. I didn't look for Derin. 

983
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:02,950
I don't think so, Yasemin. 

984
01:18:07,330 --> 01:18:08,330
Are you okay? 

985
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:11,360
In the afternoon ... 

986
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:15,000
- ... let's not reveal anything, okay? - Well. 

987
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:16,650
If I go home. Please ... 

988
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,870
... let's sit down and talk, okay? 

989
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:22,740
You didn't speak when you had the chance, Murat. 

990
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:26,400
I said I won't talk about this with the kids! 

991
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:29,380
Yasemin, don't do it. Come on, what would you be? 

992
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:30,380
We'll see you at home.

993
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:55,090
Your office is set up threatening me. I am ... 

994
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:57,790
... I am your blood. I'm your dad. 

995
01:18:57,790 --> 01:18:59,820
As a father, if I can't tell you two pairs ... 

996
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:02,950
Where is my father? I'm a donkey? 

997
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:07,430
Shall we go out to dinner with Murat and Yasemin? 

998
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:10,290
For the love of God, Sitoş! Don't call me Murat and Yasemin! 

999
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:11,950
They are fighting. 

1000
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:15,250
- How do you know that they are not doing well? - In the parking lot today ... wait a minute. 

1001
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:25,300
I saw them in the parking lot today. 

1002
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:29,470
They obviously fought. If you see Murat, without encouragement. 

1003
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:32,580
Murat has finished. Then Yasemin arrived. 

1004
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:34,000
"Let's have dinner, husband," she said. 

1005
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,510
"I'm not going anywhere with you," he said. 

1006
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:39,830
Misfortune! They all saw it. It is there in front of the company. Misfortune! 

1007
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,490
Well. We have to make sure.

1008
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:45,830
We even called Aydan and Ruhi. 

1009
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:48,440
Do we even have to go everywhere, dear? Well. 

1010
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:50,890
Murat, Yasemin is fine. Wherever you go with them. 

1011
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:53,360
He retires. But ... 

1012
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,400
... Don't call Huri and Aydan, let me love your eyes. 

1013
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:58,800
Huri, don't say it and keep it. 

1014
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,630
He gets mad, you know. I can't shoot Aydan anyway! 

1015
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:04,100
The woman did not shut up! The car asks ... 

1016
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:06,710
... order a burrito, order a muffin. She is not a silent woman. 

1017
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:09,720
Penalty, Barlas. 

1018
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,540
- Well, think of it as a gift. - Dinner? 

1019
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:13,760
It was nice. 

1020
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:18,560
Great misfortune, Sitos! 

1021
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,800
Great misfortune! 

1022
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:22,800
In the parking lot! In front of everyone! 

1023
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,100
I brought spare shoes with me. 

1024
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:40,560
Welcome.

1025
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:41,950
One minute. 

1026
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:44,440
Me or you first? 

1027
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:47,070
Here you have. 

1028
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,710
I was very impulsive in the morning. 

1029
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:53,770
You are right. 

1030
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:59,070
You have obligations and responsibilities. 

1031
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:02,110
So sorry! 

1032
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:05,390
You are also right. I should have reported. Me too ... 

1033
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:06,390
... sorry. 

1034
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:07,950
Bahar. 

1035
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:10,720
I'm in the vortex ... 

1036
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:12,090
... I can't tell. 

1037
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:14,950
Actually, I tell Yasemin the whole truth and talk to her ... 

1038
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:17,080
... you and her and all of us ... 

1039
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:20,200
I want to save this ridiculous situation. 

1040
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:23,290
Even though I promised you, I can't talk to Yasemin anymore. 

1041
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:25,860
Why is that? 

1042
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:27,680
Because Yasemin ... 

1043
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:30,620
... doesn't want to talk to the children. 

1044
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:35,090
It was weird. 

1045
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:38,410
I do not know.

1046
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:42,910
Maybe Yasemin is causing the guilty kids not to talk to you. 

1047
01:21:42,910 --> 01:21:43,850
Or maybe this situation ... 

1048
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:47,280
... is trying to ignore it. 

1049
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:50,840
Perhaps. 

1050
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:53,490
This is ridiculous, but ... 

1051
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:55,710
Maybe he's doing it. I do not know. 

1052
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,780
Look, Bahar! I've always been honest with you. 

1053
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:01,980
Now I will. 

1054
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:06,040
I told Yasemin all the things ... 

1055
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,150
... without solving this situation ... 

1056
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:10,890
... I don't want to meet. So our ... 

1057
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:13,610
... it's not right to meet like this. My purpose ... 

1058
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:14,770
... to cheat on you or my wife 

1059
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:17,720
Not to put him in a position I don't want. 

1060
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:19,070
Not really! 

1061
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:20,820
Do you get it? 

1062
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:26,740
Thanks. 

1063
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:30,390
Sight! This is between us and you ...

1064
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:33,790
... so beautiful I never want it to end. But ... 

1065
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:36,830
... I don't want it to be used like that either. 

1066
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:37,950
Being upset ... 

1067
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:40,750
I don't want anyone to get mad about breaking it. 

1068
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:48,300
I know. 

1069
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,380
You are very nice! 

1070
01:23:17,490 --> 01:23:19,130
I have time. 

1071
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,200
I can wait. 

1072
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:25,050
I miss you like crazy. 

1073
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:27,140
But I can still wait. 

1074
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:29,670
Also ... 

1075
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,080
... this is a cavalry you're doing. 

1076
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:34,500
- Come on, dear. - But it is. 

1077
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:38,350
So ... 

1078
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:41,650
I'll talk to Yasemin and figure everything out. Well? 

1079
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:45,190
I say it one more time. My purpose is not to cheat on my wife ... 

1080
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:48,040
... and put you in a situation I never wanted. Well? 

1081
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:52,060
Well. 

1082
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:54,440
Like I said ... I 

1083
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:57,070
'll wait.

1084
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:02,880
Please don't feel compressed from my point of view. 

1085
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:05,230
Well. 

1086
01:24:05,550 --> 01:24:07,050
I have a person who listens well. 

1087
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:10,350
I have one person listening. 

1088
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:12,020
It's really nice to see that! 

1089
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:35,970
It is very cold outside. 

1090
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:38,500
Will I make you a herbal tea, Mom? It warms up for you. 

1091
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:53,410
- Need help? - No. 

1092
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:54,520
My mother. You come ... 

1093
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:56,110
Come, look, sit like this. 

1094
01:24:56,540 --> 01:24:59,430
Stretch your feet too. So enjoy your tea, huh? 

1095
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:15,980
Aga, I can't hold this woman. 

1096
01:25:17,390 --> 01:25:19,660
Ulan was right here. It means exit. 

1097
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:29,740
Where are you aga? I made friends with a passenger. 

1098
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:33,190
- Welcome Sitare. - We thought it was nice, sugar. 

1099
01:25:36,830 --> 01:25:37,840
What happens? 

1100
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:42,770
We decided to. We will have dinner together tomorrow. 

1101
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:45,760
I do not accept excuses.

1102
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:50,530
Is there any news from Yasemin? I'll ask him. 

1103
01:25:50,530 --> 01:25:51,530
Maybe he made a plan, Sitare. 

1104
01:25:51,690 --> 01:25:54,510
No way! We decided, okay. 

1105
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:59,000
Barlas will take us to a great place. Isn't that so, darling? 

1106
01:26:00,170 --> 01:26:03,170
Then yes. A wonderful place aga. Just ... 

1107
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:05,220
I already made a reservation. Destination! 

1108
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,280
Great place order. 

1109
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:21,620
Thank you. 

1110
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,530
Ms. Yasemin? I bother you ... 

1111
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:26,560
... or I complain. 

1112
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,100
So, I wanted to get your news. 

1113
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:30,750
Good thing you said! 

1114
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:34,230
Now I have spoken with a psychiatrist. 

1115
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,040
Let's see, I'll try to convince. 

1116
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:43,460
Mrs. Yasemin. Don't worry, okay? 

1117
01:26:58,830 --> 01:27:00,620
Oh, everything looks amazing! 

1118
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,880
- Really? - Yes. 

1119
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:10,520
I couldn't make this salad sauce like yours. 

1120
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:11,900
Let me see.

1121
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:22,640
But this is very good. 

1122
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:25,770
This is even more beautiful than mine! 

1123
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:29,640
I am very serious! What did you put in that? 

1124
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:32,450
Tell me. I'll do it too. I put tarragon. 

1125
01:27:34,150 --> 01:27:35,150
My mother? 

1126
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:38,220
So sorry. 

1127
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:42,620
I'm sorry too! Derin! So sorry! 

1128
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:43,980
I went too far. 

1129
01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:47,150
My intention was never to hurt you! 

1130
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:51,310
A bit of balance has been broken during this time. 

1131
01:27:51,310 --> 01:27:54,030
But I promise you. It will not happen again! 

1132
01:27:54,030 --> 01:27:56,380
Honey, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 

1133
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:59,340
I wasn't supposed to go over so much, but ... 

1134
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:00,340
... something will happen to you. 

1135
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:07,760
Derin? 

1136
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:11,560
... I spoke to a psychiatrist. 

1137
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:12,700
Not! No mother! 

1138
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:16,090
Let's go once for me. What would you be 

1139
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,310
Maybe it's good for you too, huh? 

1140
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:21,290
You have a problem, you said.

1141
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:22,300
Mom, I'm fine. Really. 

1142
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:26,520
Well. Let's go then. Doctor ... 

1143
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:29,060
... "Good." Let's say, let's go back. What happens. 

1144
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:30,580
Not! I think there is no need. 

1145
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:35,130
Derin? 

1146
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:37,000
Those drugs? 

1147
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:42,300
You didn't show me those meds. Why is that? 

1148
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:44,030
Because mommy ... 

1149
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:46,730
... I knew you would bring the event here. 

1150
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:50,080
Or are you growing a lot! But I tell you. I'm good. 

1151
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:54,110
Derin? Sight! Don't worry about going to the doctor, right? 

1152
01:28:54,110 --> 01:28:55,570
Of course, no! 

1153
01:28:58,050 --> 01:28:59,970
Well! Let's go. But I tell you. 

1154
01:28:59,970 --> 01:29:03,040
There will be a waste of time. 

1155
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:04,840
I have enough time. 

1156
01:29:05,650 --> 01:29:07,190
I'll take care of your sister. 

1157
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,510
- You were going to help me with dinner. - Not! 

1158
01:29:10,510 --> 01:29:12,270
You said I would do everything myself.

1159
01:29:13,150 --> 01:29:16,370
I also know a little quick. Your father will be here in half an hour. 

1160
01:29:16,370 --> 01:29:18,360
Ugh mom! 

1161
01:29:27,890 --> 01:29:28,890
OMG! 

1162
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,940
I just got home from work, girls. But you are executing me. 

1163
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:38,890
Well, I've been cooking all day, Dad! 

1164
01:29:38,890 --> 01:29:40,740
- I also played games. - Good for you, my little bug. 

1165
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:43,290
Good for you! 

1166
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:46,240
- I brought it. There is nothing else. - Okay, mom. You, sit down. 

1167
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,300
Bread. I take the bread and come. 

1168
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:58,240
My daughter, this dish ... 

1169
01:29:59,110 --> 01:30:01,890
... is there any special meaning? 

1170
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:05,210
Actually there is. 

1171
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:07,030
Give it daddy. Let me put the salad. 

1172
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,650
I ruined your last night and ... 

1173
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:13,700
... an apology for worrying you all. 

1174
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:19,210
- Well. We appreciate. - Mom, salad? 

1175
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:21,800
But do not worry.

1176
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:24,180
I will make up for my mistake immediately and ... 

1177
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:27,240
... arrange a new weekend vacation for you. 

1178
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,240
Good enough. 

1179
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:31,400
No. One night was enough for me. 

1180
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,560
One more heart will not rise. 

1181
01:30:33,950 --> 01:30:35,600
I miss you so much. 

1182
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:44,240
- Dad where? - A courier would come from the company ... 

1183
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,420
... let me look at it. Well? 

1184
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:47,420
Well. 

1185
01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:07,110
My sexy and beloved wife. 

1186
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:08,110
What's for dinner? 

1187
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:12,300
- There is artichoke, good. - God! 

1188
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:14,980
Dad not here? 

1189
01:31:17,090 --> 01:31:18,090
No. 

1190
01:31:18,530 --> 01:31:21,050
Ay Barlas, I ask you to eat in the middle. 

1191
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:23,660
- For example, my plate? - Serve daughter. 

1192
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:31,330
Without Onur? 

1193
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:33,550
Not! 

1194
01:31:34,130 --> 01:31:37,550
- I think it's more broken than you think. - Broken? 

1195
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:39,230
How are you broken?

1196
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:42,380
The brat as much as the leg kept telling me. 

1197
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:45,430
Sitare has sent me as you know. What are you going to do? 

1198
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:47,970
Well, we'll take care of the rest, daughter. 

1199
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:55,650
Along with the employees ... 

1200
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:58,370
... the habit of talking back and forth ... you have to give up, Barlas. 

1201
01:31:58,370 --> 01:32:01,310
Sitar! Then don't put my demons on top! 

1202
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:04,200
For your knowledgeable son ... 

1203
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:06,670
What about father and son? 

1204
01:32:06,670 --> 01:32:08,470
It shouldn't be too big. 

1205
01:32:09,650 --> 01:32:10,800
I'm growing? 

1206
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,770
I'm growing? Look, I'm eating, Sitos. 

1207
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:18,410
Your son who didn't come to dinner. Tell him, not me! No problem. 

1208
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:23,460
You go too much, Barlas. 

1209
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:26,420
How much my father Onur cares. You know. Your kindness ... 

1210
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:29,380
- ... makes him happy. - You crush me too!

1211
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:32,440
- You crush me too! Well done Sitare. - Where? - I'm going out! 

1212
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:36,690
- Food? - Did you stop your appetite, Sitare? Did you leave your appetite? 

1213
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:41,870
- Artichoke? - What artichoke? 

1214
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:44,710
Barlas? 

1215
01:32:55,690 --> 01:32:58,230
- We'll be late again. - Nothing will happen dear. 

1216
01:32:58,230 --> 01:33:00,360
I reported that we stayed in traffic. 

1217
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:02,300
They will wait half an hour. 

1218
01:33:03,310 --> 01:33:05,710
This traffic won't open for half an hour! 

1219
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:07,390
We can't catch up on life! 

1220
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:13,010
Is everything okay, Ruhi? 

1221
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,360
Yes! 

1222
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:16,790
- Why is that? - I do not know. 

1223
01:33:17,090 --> 01:33:19,230
You got really mad today. I did not understand. 

1224
01:33:19,530 --> 01:33:21,700
No, I tried hard and I wish you a good celebration. 

1225
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:24,890
I'm also a contributor ... 

1226
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:28,040
Let me know, I wanted a touch to help. Suddenly ... 

1227
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:30,570
I didn't understand anything when I yelled.

1228
01:33:30,570 --> 01:33:32,840
But then this is not your help, Aydan. 

1229
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:34,960
This is your command. 

1230
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:37,950
You could consult me ​​before you call the girl. 

1231
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:42,280
I also don't like getting you involved in my work. 

1232
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:43,360
You know. 

1233
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:47,680
Also that girl ... for the celebration of our company ... 

1234
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:50,400
... is not a suitable musician. 

1235
01:33:50,830 --> 01:33:53,900
Why is that? Didn't you tell me ... 

1236
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:54,900
... I really like it? 

1237
01:33:56,770 --> 01:33:58,330
What's going on, Ruhi? 

1238
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,040
Said! 

1239
01:34:00,730 --> 01:34:03,350
Said! Well. 

1240
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:04,500
A Turkish guy. 

1241
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:09,580
I thought of another musician for the company celebration. 

1242
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:11,950
Opened. 

1243
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:15,060
We go too. 

1244
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,200
Here you are. 

1245
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:21,320
Here daddy. 

1246
01:34:22,150 --> 01:34:24,430
Thank you, my beautiful girl, thank you. 

1247
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:29,020
Enjoy it. I am depositing Ece today. 

1248
01:34:29,970 --> 01:34:31,760
The world has come to an end, my daughter.

1249
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:34,640
What a shame, dad. These are the things I always do. 

1250
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:37,230
Sure dear! Things you've always done, girl! 

1251
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:39,710
- Thanks. Bless your hands. - Enjoy your meal. I swear ... 

1252
01:34:40,460 --> 01:34:44,699
... I'll deposit Ece, one day a housewife broke me up because. 

1253
01:34:45,570 --> 01:34:47,670
What should your mother do, my daughter? Doing the same thing every day. 

1254
01:34:47,670 --> 01:34:50,230
My mom is already one. 

1255
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:53,190
- I love you so much mom. - I also. 

1256
01:34:54,050 --> 01:34:57,150
- Come on. Good night. - Good night darling. 

1257
01:35:03,870 --> 01:35:05,270
Good night. 

1258
01:35:09,790 --> 01:35:12,230
Even if Yasemin doesn't go, we can sit and talk. 

1259
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:16,510
Murat. 

1260
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,180
I've said it many times. 

1261
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:21,670
One thing we're both so angry about ... 

1262
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:24,290
... I don't want to talk when there are kids at home. 

1263
01:35:24,290 --> 01:35:26,210
But we have to talk. Even a duty.

1264
01:35:27,550 --> 01:35:30,800
We don't need to do anything. You told me this. 

1265
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:32,980
We don't need to do anything! 

1266
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:35,020
Yasemin? 

1267
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:37,700
Why can't we just sit and talk? 

1268
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:40,450
Why don't you want to know the facts? What happened? 

1269
01:35:41,090 --> 01:35:42,560
You don't want to know, huh? 

1270
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:47,299
We can't do anything about this! What would you be 

1271
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:50,220
- What happened? - Yes! 

1272
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:53,200
I can't pick up my head, Murat. 

1273
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:57,320
It's yours to worry about Derin's health ... 

1274
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:00,710
... whatever you say, I can't pay attention to it. I am sorry! 

1275
01:36:00,870 --> 01:36:01,870
I am sorry! 

1276
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:05,340
What was in Derin's health, for God's sake? Little boy. 

1277
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:08,110
He tried to kill himself, Murat. 

1278
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:11,900
What else do you need to do to get their attention? 

1279
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:14,140
You're exaggerating again, Yasemin. You're exaggerating again. 

1280
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:15,950
I'm exaggerating?

1281
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:18,890
Do you know the madicines, Murat? 

1282
01:36:19,270 --> 01:36:22,340
"The curses in Derin's room?" - No. What medicine? 

1283
01:36:22,350 --> 01:36:25,140
I'm talking about this. 

1284
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:28,140
If you try to understand a little before blaming me, listen a little ... 

1285
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:31,170
- ... maybe we will move more easily. - About the things I don't know ... 

1286
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:33,710
... maybe if you don't blame me ... 

1287
01:36:33,710 --> 01:36:35,370
... we can talk better. 

1288
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:37,240
Well. 

1289
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:38,750
I am notifying then. 

1290
01:36:39,850 --> 01:36:41,810
I made an appointment with a psychiatrist. 

1291
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:45,150
At least I'll be sure. Am I exaggerating ... 

1292
01:36:45,330 --> 01:36:46,330
... am I not exaggerating? 

1293
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:50,030
At least I make an effort, Murat! I'm trying. 

1294
01:36:50,190 --> 01:36:51,460
Am I not trying? 

1295
01:36:52,570 --> 01:36:55,160
If you come to the psychiatrist tomorrow morning ... 

1296
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:56,660
... at least you'll be convinced of this.

1297
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:19,620
This makes no sense! Derin has nothing. 

1298
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:23,810
By ignoring what happened ... 

1299
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:26,920
... we couldn't ignore, you said. 

1300
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:29,740
I will not fight you. I know. 

1301
01:37:29,740 --> 01:37:31,740
... try to disturb but will not be successful. 

1302
01:37:32,230 --> 01:37:33,510
What annoyance? 

1303
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:36,390
I'm not trying to do something like this! What are you saying? 

1304
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:39,220
Twisting and turning my words to me when the time comes ... 

1305
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:42,410
... you are the one who carries it like a spear to your head, Yasemin. 

1306
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:46,810
- Don't yell Murat! - Don't piss me off, then I won't scream! 

1307
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:50,510
Will you come to Murat yourself? Please. 

1308
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:55,900
It was like a spear! 

1309
01:37:56,350 --> 01:37:58,480
I'll just remind you. 

1310
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,440
You were the first to say that phrase, it wasn't me. 

1311
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:03,270
I'm not telling you to talk, Yasemin. 

1312
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:04,570
I express my feelings.

1313
01:38:08,790 --> 01:38:11,240
So it happens when you do the same thing ... 

1314
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:13,240
... but it doesn't happen when I say it. Is that so? 

1315
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:16,170
Why can't we talk about it, Yasemin, huh? 

1316
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:17,810
Because Murat yells at me. 

1317
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:19,840
You want to be right all the time. 

1318
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,250
And you stop and distract the subject! So we can not talk! 

1319
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:24,250
Well! 

1320
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:25,950
I'm getting up. I go! 

1321
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:37,520
Can we talk to you? 

1322
01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:39,210
Now? 

1323
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:40,680
Yes. 

1324
01:38:41,110 --> 01:38:42,360
Is there a problem? 

1325
01:38:44,299 --> 01:38:44,859
No. 

1326
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:51,890
- Good. - Go ahead. 

1327
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:14,010
I see that you are nervous. 

1328
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:15,700
Ah, please don't stress. 

1329
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:18,700
Especially in our young clients ... 

1330
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:21,150
... from time to time, we have meetings with a close circle. 

1331
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:24,170
A moment ready to see you ... I 

1332
01:39:24,170 --> 01:39:25,940
just wanted to meet you.

1333
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:28,300
I understand. Here you are. 

1334
01:39:30,450 --> 01:39:33,300
How many years have you been married? Twenty. 

1335
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:37,260
Congratulations! 

1336
01:39:45,170 --> 01:39:47,930
- Did I say something funny? - Then "Congratulations!" ... 

1337
01:39:47,930 --> 01:39:50,420
... as if we were successful. 

1338
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:56,459
Although Yasemin may be right. 

1339
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:02,250
About? 

1340
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:05,270
In all aspects. Especially when it comes to marriage. He wrote his book. 

1341
01:40:05,350 --> 01:40:08,290
How to behave? How not to behave? What is done? 

1342
01:40:08,290 --> 01:40:11,280
What is not done? You know it very well. 

1343
01:40:12,130 --> 01:40:13,450
That's all! 

1344
01:40:13,950 --> 01:40:15,270
This is exactly what you do! 

1345
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:18,480
This is your behavior, this is your speech ... 

1346
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:20,420
... your ridiculous words. 

1347
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:23,010
When you do this, are there no bad intentions? 

1348
01:40:26,110 --> 01:40:28,190
As the name says. I'm kidding, Yasemin. 

1349
01:40:31,930 --> 01:40:35,020
I am sorry. I failed again.

1350
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:36,020
I couldn't deserve you again. 

1351
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:45,100
Do you really want to do this now? 

1352
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:46,100
Come on, for the love of God! 

1353
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:48,570
Does it matter what I want? 

1354
01:40:49,850 --> 01:40:50,850
It is? 

1355
01:40:50,910 --> 01:40:51,910
No. 

1356
01:40:52,350 --> 01:40:55,080
Because everything has to be what you want! 

1357
01:40:55,150 --> 01:40:58,040
If everything is not what you want, you are having problems! 

1358
01:40:58,040 --> 01:41:00,650
We all have to be what you want! 

1359
01:41:00,650 --> 01:41:02,570
Oh, let's not be one! Let's not be one! 

1360
01:41:02,730 --> 01:41:04,890
You take us away from you immediately ... 

1361
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:07,670
... you punish us without love, Yasemin. 

1362
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:11,260
As we crawl on the ground, we suffer, you ... 

1363
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:13,760
... with all your cold blood ... 

1364
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:15,430
... come in, you see us. 

1365
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:21,280
But you never forgive! Never! 

1366
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:25,350
Am I wrong because I didn't scream my pain? 

1367
01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:28,300
Well. Let me tell you then. 

1368
01:41:29,650 --> 01:41:32,190
You will always be happy ...

1369
01:41:32,190 --> 01:41:33,930
... every year without catching a cold ... 

1370
01:41:34,340 --> 01:41:37,810
... because I prepared a birthday very carefully, sorry. 

1371
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:41,150
It will be said behind me ... 

1372
01:41:41,510 --> 01:41:44,990
... or you will talk to your friends ... 

1373
01:41:45,790 --> 01:41:48,100
... come and just say, "I don't want to." You can say! 

1374
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:52,150
But then there is no flavor, is it Murat? 

1375
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:56,830
I'm tired of this, you have nothing to say about Yasemin! 

1376
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:04,370
You think I blame you for Ece's illness. 

1377
01:42:06,410 --> 01:42:08,050
Yes! You are right. I blame! 

1378
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:10,350
But I also blame myself! 

1379
01:42:11,550 --> 01:42:13,720
With you, that child ... 

1380
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,730
... we could not protect that child that we must protect, Murat. 

1381
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:18,100
I am sorry. 

1382
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,500
I say "What should I do?" In my mistakes ... 

1383
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:26,880
I can't forgive myself as easily as you! 

1384
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:28,820
It was an accident. 

1385
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:31,120
What will we do?

1386
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:32,750
This child is like 

1387
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:35,740
this ... ... this patient will continue to live ... 

1388
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:36,740
... I can't get out of it ... 

1389
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:39,900
As long as I felt something ... 

1390
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:41,700
... act without thinking ... 

1391
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:43,340
.. I can't! 

1392
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:46,000
Even if it hurts ... 

1393
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:48,440
... I hold on not to worry them. 

1394
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:51,450
This may seem like insensitive to you! 

1395
01:42:52,730 --> 01:42:53,730
But believe me ... 

1396
01:42:54,220 --> 01:42:56,150
I'm suffering a lot, Murat! 

1397
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:01,220
I am sorry for the injustices I have done to you ... 

1398
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:04,270
... to spend a night with you ... 

1399
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:10,290
... when I surprise you, you open the door ... 

1400
01:43:10,290 --> 01:43:11,850
... when you are half naked with your lover ... 

1401
01:43:12,690 --> 01:43:14,120
... Trust me, I'm sorry, Murat. 

1402
01:43:14,770 --> 01:43:15,770
So sorry! 

1403
01:43:21,420 --> 01:43:24,760
But then, when my daughter was at home in fear that she would die ...

1404
01:43:24,830 --> 01:43:26,940
I bury this pain in me 

1405
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:31,310
For days, it's like he's responsible for fooling 

1406
01:43:32,210 --> 01:43:34,470
me ... 

1407
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,670
... blaming me, making fun of me ... ... making fun of you, I'm sorry, you ... 

1408
01:43:38,670 --> 01:43:40,420
... was making fun of your phrase, right? 

1409
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:45,390
Trying to endure all of this ... 

1410
01:43:45,390 --> 01:43:47,370
... on the other hand, "Could I be right?" 

1411
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:51,480
Because I'm a terrible person, make me ... 

1412
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:54,020
... could he have had to cheat? 

1413
01:43:55,110 --> 01:43:56,110
If Murat. 

1414
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:57,770
I have a lot of pain. 

1415
01:44:09,219 --> 01:44:09,699
Forgiveness. 

1416
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:19,490
Did you want to talk, Murat? 

1417
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:23,130
How well we were talking! What happened? 

1418
01:44:25,770 --> 01:44:26,770
Well ... 

1419
01:44:29,530 --> 01:44:31,700
... I think Derin is fine. 

1420
01:44:33,450 --> 01:44:35,610
But if you want ... 

1421
01:44:35,610 --> 01:44:38,070
... you can come with your husband. 

1422
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:42,330
Here you are. 

1423
01:44:59,339 --> 01:45:00,619
Forgiveness. 

1424
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:08,820
Mommy?

1425
01:45:09,190 --> 01:45:11,170
Why did my father leave at that time? 

1426
01:45:11,170 --> 01:45:13,300
I asked. He didn't say it either. 

1427
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:16,420
I think he was crying. Very urgent ... 

1428
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:18,130
... had to go to work. 

1429
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,250
Are you okay? 

1430
01:45:21,230 --> 01:45:22,710
I'm fine, I think I'm fine. 

1431
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:31,530
Mom, your car, drawn! 

1432
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:37,590
Mommy, your car was dragged the whole time and you didn't! 

1433
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:40,010
Your mood is really broken. 

1434
01:45:40,650 --> 01:45:41,900
No longer. 

1435
01:45:42,890 --> 01:45:45,560
- Come on, aren't you coming? - Well ... 

1436
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:47,840
... mom, I'm going to Bahar. 

1437
01:45:52,210 --> 01:45:53,210
Well. 

1438
01:45:53,410 --> 01:45:54,410
What happened? 

1439
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:56,700
Nothing. See you later. 

1440
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:58,650
See you. 

1441
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:04,560
What is happening with this woman? 

1442
01:46:21,110 --> 01:46:24,080
Handsome. Well. What about the sores you opened? 

1443
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:25,300
What wound? 

1444
01:46:25,490 --> 01:46:28,210
What wound have I opened for years? 

1445
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:29,070
... Yasemin ...

1446
01:46:29,070 --> 01:46:32,080
Couldn't it be affected at all? 

1447
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:34,520
So he doesn't really feel anything ... 

1448
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:35,950
... Is it possible? 

1449
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:38,370
So even with a little pain, huh? 

1450
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:41,480
Trying to endure all of this ... 

1451
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:44,350
... on the other hand, "Could I be right?" 

1452
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:47,680
"Because I'm a terrible person ... 

1453
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:50,320
... could he have had to cheat? 

1454
01:46:51,310 --> 01:46:52,320
Yes Murat. 

1455
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:54,090
I'm in a lot of pain. 

1456
01:46:57,950 --> 01:46:59,380
How happy are you! 

1457
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:01,840
Happy? 

1458
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:05,620
Are you kidding me? 

1459
01:47:06,190 --> 01:47:09,120
No. Oh, you hit until You made it. What could it be? 

1460
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:11,820
This is what you wanted. 

1461
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:14,340
I didn't want such a thing. 

1462
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:15,680
Is that so? 

1463
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:17,680
What did you want? 

1464
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:22,920
Come. Let's sit like this. 

1465
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:37,010
Our boy? 

1466
01:47:38,510 --> 01:47:40,990
Break the one he loves the most.

1467
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,840
To understand that he is loved, those cardigans stop ... 

1468
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:46,640
... both you and yourself. 

1469
01:47:47,970 --> 01:47:50,460
Indifference kills the lover. 

1470
01:47:50,930 --> 01:47:53,770
Once you are used to seeing, hearing ... 

1471
01:47:54,290 --> 01:47:55,990
... to be unique. 

1472
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:00,410
Otherwise they hesitate ... 

1473
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,640
... get angry. 

1474
01:48:03,010 --> 01:48:05,860
Because to not be seen in the eyes of the loved one ... 

1475
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:06,860
... to not be heard ... 

1476
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:10,260
... it feels like you're not there. 

1477
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:13,900
Without Eva ... 

1478
01:48:14,530 --> 01:48:17,230
... if I didn't look at him and yell, Adam ... 

1479
01:48:17,230 --> 01:48:18,250
Could it be Adam? 

1480
01:48:21,490 --> 01:48:22,490
I ... 

1481
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:24,200
... did these things? 

1482
01:48:26,310 --> 01:48:28,010
Let me tell you a story. 

1483
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:31,290
The story of Yusuf and Züleyha. 

1484
01:48:33,330 --> 01:48:35,280
Züleyha Şaşa ... 

1485
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:38,210
... lives in wealth. 

1486
01:48:38,530 --> 01:48:40,420
But he has become a slave to love.

1487
01:48:41,740 --> 01:48:43,830
One day he says to his slave ... 

1488
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:47,160
"Go! Find Yusuf, put him down ... 

1489
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:48,890
... stay well. 

1490
01:48:49,650 --> 01:48:51,740
But leave him for your stick ... 

1491
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:54,380
... from here, from afar ... 

1492
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:56,990
.. . I can hear howls. 

1493
01:48:58,540 --> 01:49:00,160
By order of the slave ... 

1494
01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:02,740
... he's going to beat Yusuf. 

1495
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:04,640
But ... 

1496
01:49:04,990 --> 01:49:06,970
... I can't see him when you see your beautiful face. 

1497
01:49:08,050 --> 01:49:11,320
He sees a sheepskin there. He shakes his cane at him. . 

1498
01:49:12,230 --> 01:49:15,520
Every time the slave shook his staff, Yusuf is also out of line ... 

1499
01:49:15,530 --> 01:49:18,390
... oh, howl ... 

1500
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:19,580
... it starts. 

1501
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,580
Züleyha, who heard Yusuf's screams ... 

1502
01:49:23,580 --> 01:49:26,190
... " Shoot! "He says. 

1503
01:49:26,190 --> 01:49:29,130
" Shoot more. "" Shoot well. " 

1504
01:49:30,410 --> 01:49:32,720
The slave says ... 

1505
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:35,310
" O sun-faced Yusuf!

1506
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:37,310
Now Züleyha comes from behind ... 

1507
01:49:37,310 --> 01:49:40,010
... if he doesn't see stick marks ... 

1508
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:43,140
... he takes me into account, he punishes me. 

1509
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:46,680
Now take off, open your shoulder ... 

1510
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:47,680
... grit your teeth. 

1511
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:51,710
The stick I'm hitting now will hurt you. 

1512
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:52,710
says ... 

1513
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:55,530
What should Yusuf do? 

1514
01:49:55,620 --> 01:49:57,700
He undresses, opens his shoulder. 

1515
01:49:58,550 --> 01:50:01,640
Lower the slave stick in such a way that ... 

1516
01:50:02,510 --> 01:50:04,040
seven times ... 

1517
01:50:04,370 --> 01:50:05,590
... heaven to earth ... 

1518
01:50:06,050 --> 01:50:07,090
... groans. 

1519
01:50:07,550 --> 01:50:09,410
It is a noise. 

1520
01:50:11,530 --> 01:50:13,860
Who heard this last act ... 

1521
01:50:14,270 --> 01:50:15,440
Züleyha ... 

1522
01:50:16,190 --> 01:50:19,280
"Enough is enough!" 

1523
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:20,830
"Enough! 

1524
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:22,880
This is" Ah! "... 

1525
01:50:23,150 --> 01:50:26,050
" came out very deep " 

1526
01:50:27,030 --> 01:50:30,090
" Ah! "There is" Ah! "There is our boy.

1527
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:39,700
... human beings will stop to love you. 

1528
01:50:40,890 --> 01:50:43,990
When you hear, believe. 

1529
01:50:43,990 --> 01:50:46,979
But he cannot bear the pain. 

1530
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:49,870
Like Züleyha ... 

1531
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,730
... "Enough!" she cries. 

1532
01:50:56,540 --> 01:50:57,670
All of this I ... 

1533
01:50:58,220 --> 01:50:59,480
... did I do it on purpose? 

1534
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:01,480
The real question is ... 

1535
01:51:02,980 --> 01:51:04,840
If I say I did it without knowing ... 

1536
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:08,120
... does it reduce your pain and regret? 

1537
01:51:09,590 --> 01:51:11,250
Change things ... 

1538
01:51:11,810 --> 01:51:14,330
... will it heal the wounds you hurt? 

1539
01:51:42,350 --> 01:51:44,960
- Coffee? - Well. 

1540
01:51:52,540 --> 01:51:55,280
- I guess the permit is out. - What permission? 

1541
01:51:56,490 --> 01:51:59,580
I come from the doctor, not from home. 

1542
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:09,500
My mother got me to be a psychiatrist. 

1543
01:52:11,130 --> 01:52:13,110
So how did it go? 

1544
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:17,939
My father also came. The woman took two of these. Fight inside the apocalypse!

1545
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:21,670
Well, my mom said, "Nothing," she says but ... 

1546
01:52:21,670 --> 01:52:22,750
... my father was very flat. 

1547
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:26,600
Since he still sees me as a child, of course, he doesn't tell me anything. 

1548
01:52:28,110 --> 01:52:30,350
Mothers generally do this. 

1549
01:52:30,830 --> 01:52:34,030
But you have to show that you are growing, now Derin. 

1550
01:52:35,470 --> 01:52:36,790
How can I do that? 

1551
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:39,240
Making your own decisions. 

1552
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:42,520
Well, I already make my own decisions. 

1553
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:45,860
You're sure? 

1554
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:48,920
So, for example, you decided to quit school. But what are you doing ... 

1555
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:51,420
... you don't dare say or do. 

1556
01:52:53,610 --> 01:52:56,370
You are right! Actually, you are quite right. 

1557
01:52:57,520 --> 01:52:59,350
Well. After that, I will be brave! 

1558
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:01,180
Handsome! 

1559
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,780
So brave decisions! 

1560
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:16,970
Get ready at seven at night! 

1561
01:53:16,970 --> 01:53:19,040
We are ready and we go out together.

1562
01:53:19,350 --> 01:53:21,290
We can't, Barlas. 

1563
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,400
What can we say? 

1564
01:53:23,690 --> 01:53:26,880
My belly button broke until I got the reservation. Why can't you come? 

1565
01:53:26,990 --> 01:53:29,220
I guess Yasemin doesn't want it. I do not know. 

1566
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:32,510
Now I can't fight her, we're not coming! 

1567
01:53:32,510 --> 01:53:35,490
There is no such thing! There is no such thing! Sitare takes care of that situation. 

1568
01:53:35,490 --> 01:53:38,170
Aga does not interfere with women's work. 

1569
01:53:38,170 --> 01:53:41,130
Get ready at seven thirty at night. Half past seven. 

1570
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:59,060
Bahar, thank you very much. 

1571
01:53:59,910 --> 01:54:02,090
I didn't do anything, honey. 

1572
01:54:02,090 --> 01:54:04,630
What else will you do? I feel great! 

1573
01:54:08,950 --> 01:54:10,740
- See you. - Goodbye. 

1574
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:33,420
What happened again? 

1575
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:48,860
Did you come to pull my hair out? 

1576
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:53,980
I can pass? 

1577
01:54:54,430 --> 01:54:56,990
This is not a topic to be discussed at the door. 

1578
01:55:48,410 --> 01:55:49,790
Do you drink something?

1579
01:55:50,330 --> 01:55:51,360
There's no need. 

1580
01:55:55,900 --> 01:55:58,100
You stay standing. 

1581
01:56:31,610 --> 01:56:33,610
- I'm listening. - What? 

1582
01:56:35,070 --> 01:56:36,090
So ... 

1583
01:56:36,550 --> 01:56:38,780
Since you were the one who seduced my husband ... 

1584
01:56:39,330 --> 01:56:41,940
I guess you have something to tell. 

1585
01:56:42,310 --> 01:56:45,979
I didn't seduce your husband, Yasemin! Your husband seduced me. 

1586
01:56:46,430 --> 01:56:48,250
I don't know what he told you, but ... 

1587
01:56:48,250 --> 01:56:50,770
... I have no intention of being with a married man. 

1588
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:54,950
But Murat is married. With me. 

1589
01:56:57,870 --> 01:57:00,760
You said well. Thanks! 

1590
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:10,800
Well ... 

1591
01:57:12,250 --> 01:57:14,710
... is there something you want to tell me? 

1592
01:57:15,890 --> 01:57:16,890
Like what? 

1593
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:19,690
Stop chasing my husband! 

1594
01:57:20,750 --> 01:57:21,750
... and so. 

1595
01:57:29,270 --> 01:57:31,380
How long has this relationship been? 

1596
01:57:32,030 --> 01:57:33,030
Two years. 

1597
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:44,320
You didn't wait, did you? 

1598
01:57:49,290 --> 01:57:52,010
Joke, Yasemin, joke! 

1599
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:56,650
What a bad idea came here ...

1600
01:57:56,650 --> 01:58:00,040
... I think I can talk to you. This is an absurd idea. 

1601
01:58:00,350 --> 01:58:02,250
There is no relationship. 

1602
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:05,830
We only met several times. 

1603
01:58:06,460 --> 01:58:08,000
We had a good time, that's all. 

1604
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:18,590
So will you continue the conversation? 

1605
01:58:19,390 --> 01:58:20,390
I do not know. 

1606
01:58:23,630 --> 01:58:25,600
You haven't talked to Murat yet, have you? 

1607
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:31,800
Yasemin, look. 

1608
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:34,890
Truths ... 

1609
01:58:37,150 --> 01:58:38,440
... sit like this. 

1610
01:58:38,930 --> 01:58:40,050
There's no need! 

1611
01:58:40,390 --> 01:58:43,110
I'm fine. No Yasemin. 

1612
01:58:43,110 --> 01:58:44,150
Let's sit down and talk. 

1613
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:49,220
- I'm listening. - Well. 

1614
01:58:54,240 --> 01:58:56,480
You want to learn the facts. 

1615
01:58:57,900 --> 01:59:00,590
I don't want to make you dumb anyway. 

1616
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:05,270
Then I will explain everything. 

1617
01:59:06,650 --> 01:59:08,130
What it really is. 

1618
01:59:09,390 --> 01:59:12,190
You are someone trying to take advantage of my husband's money and location. 

1619
01:59:12,190 --> 01:59:15,300
Why should I trust you?

1620
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:16,830
Because Yasemin ... 

1621
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:20,900
- I think your friends are not trustworthy. - What does that mean? 

1622
01:59:21,330 --> 01:59:22,610
Beware of your friends, that means. 

1623
01:59:24,140 --> 01:59:25,440
what do you mean? 

1624
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:28,780
Maybe they know everything. 

1625
01:59:29,490 --> 01:59:31,720
But they are hiding from you, Yasemin. 

1626
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:36,550
What are you talking about? Who is that? 

1627
01:59:38,580 --> 01:59:40,430
You better ask them. 

1628
01:59:41,120 --> 01:59:43,590
After all, nobody likes snipers. 

1629
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:50,280
You are lying! 

1630
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:54,739
Could be. This is also a possibility. 

1631
02:00:01,210 --> 02:00:03,150
I'll say something, did you break? 

1632
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:06,380
But you are quite right. 

1633
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:10,570
If I find out that my friends are stabbing me in the back ... 

1634
02:00:10,970 --> 02:00:11,970
... I'm scattered too. 

1635
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:17,400
I do not have anything to talk to you! 

1636
02:00:21,490 --> 02:00:23,230
If you say so, it is. 

1637
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:43,240
This is number one, I know.

1638
02:00:44,100 --> 02:00:46,700
Telling your friends like this ... 

1639
02:00:46,700 --> 02:00:48,450
You're trying to make me paranoid. 

1640
02:00:49,370 --> 02:00:50,560
Goodbye Yasemin. 

1641
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:23,840
If Sitare? 

1642
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:27,910
The reservation is complete by eight at night. 

1643
02:01:27,910 --> 02:01:28,910
Barlas took care of that. 

1644
02:01:31,590 --> 02:01:34,350
- Why is that? - What do you mean 'why? 

1645
02:01:34,350 --> 02:01:35,560
We will go to dinner. 

1646
02:01:37,380 --> 02:01:40,200
No. Why now? So did something happen? 

1647
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:43,590
Now there is not always space. 

1648
02:01:43,740 --> 02:01:45,330
With cancellation reservation ... 

1649
02:01:46,160 --> 02:01:48,130
What's the ridiculous question? 

1650
02:01:48,470 --> 02:01:51,060
I answer like crazy! 

1651
02:01:51,060 --> 02:01:54,130
What's going on honey We will go to the bottom of the dinner. 

1652
02:01:54,150 --> 02:01:56,460
Do you have a problem Yasemin? 

1653
02:01:56,460 --> 02:01:58,820
There is nothing. There is nothing. 

1654
02:01:58,820 --> 02:02:02,270
... I have no taste, Sitare. If you'll forgive me ... 

1655
02:02:02,700 --> 02:02:07,410
I think you were crazy! How difficult is it to find a place there?

1656
02:02:07,410 --> 02:02:08,970
Barlas was hurt. 

1657
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:11,000
I ate the meat off my head. 

1658
02:02:11,330 --> 02:02:14,740
What am I going to say now? Isn't Yasemin's state of mind correct? 

1659
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:18,310
So ... this is also an option. 

1660
02:02:18,310 --> 02:02:20,880
No ma'am! There is no such option. Get it out of your mind! 

1661
02:02:23,890 --> 02:02:26,080
Yasemin! Coal coal. 

1662
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:29,550
Let go of your recipe. Live in the moment, honey! 

1663
02:02:29,550 --> 02:02:33,819
You are completely trapped at home! You have reached the domestic feminine mode, Bravo! 

1664
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:38,430
I am very elegant. 

1665
02:02:38,430 --> 02:02:40,220
I'm thinking of shining, honey. 

1666
02:02:40,540 --> 02:02:44,930
Don't use anything simple there! Please don't make me like that please! 

1667
02:02:44,930 --> 02:02:49,590
No Sitare. Whatever you wear, it stays with you. 

1668
02:02:50,650 --> 02:02:53,530
I love this. Well. 

1669
02:02:53,530 --> 02:02:56,310
I will give Aydan an ultimatum. 

1670
02:02:56,310 --> 02:02:58,870
Let's close it. Do not be late. 

1671
02:02:58,870 --> 02:03:01,290
Come on, I kissed. Goodbye. Goodbye.

1672
02:03:03,930 --> 02:03:05,840
I swelled up. 

1673
02:03:06,240 --> 02:03:07,240
Well ... 

1674
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:08,880
... are you enjoying yourself? 

1675
02:03:09,420 --> 02:03:12,220
- Shall we go to the meeting? - I don't understand dad. 

1676
02:03:12,220 --> 02:03:15,170
You do not understand! They have all spread it! 

1677
02:03:15,170 --> 02:03:18,210
The company has left the company! Discipline, etc. 

1678
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:19,320
... Do it well! 

1679
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:23,579
We meet according to the pleasure of the nation, according to the appointment of the nation! 

1680
02:03:23,950 --> 02:03:27,420
We were finally able to meet today! 

1681
02:03:27,660 --> 02:03:30,580
If we believe that yesterday I waited for you for hours ... 

1682
02:03:30,580 --> 02:03:33,600
.... thank God. Damn, I'm an old man! 

1683
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:36,300
Do I have to wait for you here? What's that? 

1684
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:38,920
We have given our work to our children ... 

1685
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:42,090
...... we will be comfortable. Listen to it, don't believe it! Look at this! 

1686
02:03:42,090 --> 02:03:43,090
Misfortune! 

1687
02:03:43,570 --> 02:03:46,950
You're absolutely right, Grandpa. There is a great misfortune!

1688
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:49,550
And it is clear from whom. 

1689
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:51,100
What does that mean? 

1690
02:03:51,510 --> 02:03:53,810
Namely, I came to the company yesterday. 

1691
02:03:53,810 --> 02:03:56,480
But meeting in an empty room for hours ... 

1692
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:57,570
... wait. 

1693
02:03:58,690 --> 02:04:02,010
One minute! I don't understand anything. What's going on here? 

1694
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,820
Brother Murat, how do you care about the company now. 

1695
02:04:05,820 --> 02:04:08,870
- You have no idea. - Yes darling? - When your mind is elsewhere. 

1696
02:04:08,870 --> 02:04:11,900
- What does Sadri Bey say this boy? - Murat, Murat. 

1697
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:14,810
OK, calm down, calm down. Onur. 

1698
02:04:14,810 --> 02:04:17,970
Be careful with your words! Your brother Murat is not your friend! 

1699
02:04:18,750 --> 02:04:21,110
Because I have no idea that I came ... 

1700
02:04:21,110 --> 02:04:24,140
Good. Understood. Barlas. 

1701
02:04:24,140 --> 02:04:27,160
- You said he didn't come to me. - It's late, dad. 

1702
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:28,320
You were outside. 

1703
02:04:29,930 --> 02:04:31,900
We will talk about them later. Yes. Schedule? 

1704
02:04:31,900 --> 02:04:33,540
Not! Let's talk now, grandpa.

1705
02:04:33,540 --> 02:04:36,110
Because you don't know what's going on here. 

1706
02:04:36,730 --> 02:04:37,780
My dad ... 

1707
02:04:37,780 --> 02:04:40,230
... put me in a room for a meeting yesterday ... 

1708
02:04:40,230 --> 02:04:41,730
... lots of old reports piled up in front of me. 

1709
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:45,230
I was like an idiot for hours ... I went through those reports. 

1710
02:04:46,010 --> 02:04:48,820
It will keep me entertained and out of the game! 

1711
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:51,180
This is the agenda. 

1712
02:04:51,930 --> 02:04:52,930
Mr. Sadri. 

1713
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:55,710
I sent those reports to your desk. 

1714
02:04:56,180 --> 02:04:58,160
To have information. 

1715
02:04:58,160 --> 02:05:00,500
Those who don't know last year can't understand this year ... 

1716
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:03,430
... I sent those reports just because he didn't know. 

1717
02:05:03,430 --> 02:05:05,480
Onur well, shut up Onur, shut up. 

1718
02:05:10,580 --> 02:05:11,730
Yes. Understood. 

1719
02:05:12,220 --> 02:05:15,450
You dealt with the problems between you first ... 

1720
02:05:15,450 --> 02:05:17,660
... call me at the meeting after that. 

1721
02:05:18,130 --> 02:05:19,920
My time is precious!

1722
02:05:20,490 --> 02:05:22,630
We can't do business with the bad boy, Sadri Bey. 

1723
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:28,840
Speaks! 

1724
02:05:29,950 --> 02:05:31,370
What do you mean, Onur, huh? 

1725
02:05:31,690 --> 02:05:32,690
what do you mean? 

1726
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:36,010
It had nothing to do with the company! 

1727
02:05:36,010 --> 02:05:38,640
My mind was elsewhere. Tell me where my mind is. 

1728
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:40,970
Tell me, let's find out, bro. 

1729
02:05:41,370 --> 02:05:43,900
Good Murat. Here's the boy. Do not do anything. 

1730
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:46,200
Are we going to work with the child? 

1731
02:05:48,460 --> 02:05:50,590
Sorry about the report, little one! I am sorry! 

1732
02:05:51,050 --> 02:05:53,880
What things do you like from now on, tell me! 

1733
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:57,100
I will send them to you. I will even install some games on your computer! 

1734
02:05:57,230 --> 02:06:00,190
Hang out with them! Get! 

1735
02:06:00,250 --> 02:06:01,820
Don't go back to the meeting without reading them! 

1736
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:06,380
Everything is for you! 

1737
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:10,320
I didn't even open my mouth, you saw it yourself. 

1738
02:06:14,030 --> 02:06:15,880
Welcome to the first league, son!

1739
02:06:44,130 --> 02:06:46,430
- Welcome! - Thanks. 

1740
02:06:46,430 --> 02:06:49,860
There were pumpkins for the night. Should I do it? Murat Bey likes it. 

1741
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:51,230
There's no need. 

1742
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:56,490
My lamb. But we weren't running. We've alredy talk about that. 

1743
02:06:56,840 --> 02:06:59,690
Mrs. Filiz, we're going to dinner tonight with Murat. That's why. 

1744
02:06:59,690 --> 02:07:01,220
So there is no need, I said. 

1745
02:07:02,820 --> 02:07:05,420
The game is very boring without running! 

1746
02:07:05,420 --> 02:07:08,560
.. then the mother gets very angry, dear. You know it. 

1747
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:09,450
Mrs. Filiz? 

1748
02:07:09,450 --> 02:07:12,460
So I wonder if you spend the night ... 

1749
02:07:12,460 --> 02:07:15,050
It is possible. So with Ece. 

1750
02:07:15,050 --> 02:07:18,070
- Derin but you know. - Of course I'm staying. 

1751
02:07:18,070 --> 02:07:19,070
Do not worry. 

1752
02:07:19,350 --> 02:07:22,320
Aunt Filiz. Shall we play with my babies? 

1753
02:07:23,210 --> 02:07:25,970
But Aunt Filiz can't play with you. 

1754
02:07:25,970 --> 02:07:27,640
- He has jobs. - Yes. I am ...

1755
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:29,540
I'll tell the people in the house, okay? 

1756
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:33,670
- Then you play. - Mommy, I have a job too. 

1757
02:07:33,670 --> 02:07:36,660
But you have become a great girl now. 

1758
02:07:36,660 --> 02:07:39,270
You can play alone. 

1759
02:07:39,270 --> 02:07:42,630
When will Sister Bahar finish? When will it come? 

1760
02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:47,630
Then go to dinner with my aunt Filiz. 

1761
02:07:47,630 --> 02:07:49,360
Why? 

1762
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:54,179
Let my father come. Let Sister Bahar come too. The three of us play. 

1763
02:07:54,380 --> 02:07:57,350
Don't be silly, Ece! Do not be ridiculous! 

1764
02:07:57,350 --> 02:07:58,350
Your mother is me. Did you understand? 

1765
02:07:58,410 --> 02:07:59,860
Your mother is me. 

1766
02:08:05,450 --> 02:08:08,510
I am sorry. I'm so sorry, my dear. 

1767
02:08:08,510 --> 02:08:09,690
So sorry! 

1768
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:17,550
However, you squeezed my arm. 

1769
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:20,910
I know it darling. It happened by mistake. So sorry! 

1770
02:08:20,910 --> 02:08:23,590
I'm really sorry. Let's do something, come on.

1771
02:08:23,720 --> 02:08:26,110
Then let's do something. Let's go to my room. 

1772
02:08:26,310 --> 02:08:29,390
Let's prepare my clothes together. Will it be my darling? 

1773
02:08:30,660 --> 02:08:31,830
Okay dear. 

1774
02:08:33,310 --> 02:08:34,540
My Ece. 

1775
02:08:35,730 --> 02:08:36,730
Come. 

1776
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:38,540
Come dear. 

1777
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,900
We chose this dress, right, mom? 

1778
02:08:50,900 --> 02:08:51,900
Yes mom. 

1779
02:08:52,950 --> 02:08:55,960
I'm going to dress Yasemin baby. 

1780
02:08:55,960 --> 02:08:57,190
Well. Here you have. Dresses. 

1781
02:08:58,370 --> 02:08:59,880
Without running, slowly. 

1782
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:21,530
For my husband's money, his location ... 

1783
02:09:22,110 --> 02:09:24,880
... you're trying to take advantage of it. 

1784
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:25,880
Why should I trust you? 

1785
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,550
Because Yasemin ... 

1786
02:09:28,100 --> 02:09:30,720
... I think your friends are not trustworthy. 

1787
02:09:31,610 --> 02:09:32,610
What does that mean? 

1788
02:09:32,940 --> 02:09:34,740
It means paying attention to your friends. 

1789
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:36,590
what do you mean? 

1790
02:09:37,810 --> 02:09:39,860
Maybe they know everything. 

1791
02:09:40,650 --> 02:09:42,880
But they are hiding from you, Yasemin.

1792
02:09:45,550 --> 02:09:47,720
What are you talking about? Who is that? 

1793
02:09:50,250 --> 02:09:51,910
You better ask them. 

1794
02:09:52,780 --> 02:09:55,220
After all, nobody likes snipers. 

1795
02:10:00,460 --> 02:10:01,710
You are lying. 

1796
02:10:02,590 --> 02:10:03,720
Could be. 

1797
02:10:04,850 --> 02:10:05,960
This is also a possibility. 

1798
02:10:12,050 --> 02:10:13,970
I'm going to say something. Are you broken? 

1799
02:10:16,230 --> 02:10:17,230
But you are very right! 

1800
02:10:18,110 --> 02:10:21,410
If I find out that my friends stab me in the back ... 

1801
02:10:21,810 --> 02:10:22,810
... I will break too. 

1802
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:34,480
Where are you darling We will say the dishes. 

1803
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:36,020
Are you still freshening up your lipstick? 

1804
02:10:36,550 --> 02:10:38,110
Well. It's over. 

1805
02:10:38,470 --> 02:10:40,760
What are you doing girls 

1806
02:10:43,740 --> 02:10:46,390
I tell that boy. I can not tell. 

1807
02:10:46,390 --> 02:10:49,870
It looks oily. 

1808
02:10:50,270 --> 02:10:52,870
What are you doing girls 

1809
02:10:52,870 --> 02:10:55,440
- Why did you come Aydan? - So what should I do, sugar? I am bored.

1810
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:58,300
- They always talk business. - Would it be, darling? 

1811
02:10:58,300 --> 02:11:01,020
We have you watched with them. Men ... 

1812
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:02,930
... don't come to leave you alone. 

1813
02:11:04,220 --> 02:11:06,870
Not! So while we were in the bathroom ... 

1814
02:11:06,870 --> 02:11:08,930
... even if they find someone, Sitare. 

1815
02:11:08,930 --> 02:11:11,870
There's nothing to do. 

1816
02:11:12,890 --> 02:11:15,130
Yasemin, what happened? 

1817
02:11:15,650 --> 02:11:18,760
Nothing. Well, come close. You are beautiful, okay. 

1818
02:11:19,210 --> 02:11:22,520
He has worked very hard to reserve a place here. Go. 

1819
02:11:23,500 --> 02:11:24,500
Go Go! Go. 

1820
02:11:36,510 --> 02:11:37,840
The boy from yesterday is shaking my seat. 

1821
02:11:38,870 --> 02:11:41,760
What? But this is normal, Barlas. So ... 

1822
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:43,180
... the horn will pass the ear eventually. 

1823
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:46,110
But the energy of the young man really ... 

1824
02:11:47,340 --> 02:11:48,340
is another. 

1825
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:55,350
What are you talking about? Who is he?

1826
02:11:55,350 --> 02:11:58,340
Air sugar, water. Our youth. Our youth. 

1827
02:11:58,340 --> 02:12:01,050
But! It's not that far ... 

1828
02:12:01,050 --> 02:12:02,050
... honey? 

1829
02:12:02,780 --> 02:12:05,280
Oh, you're going to say it for Barlas. 

1830
02:12:09,870 --> 02:12:11,720
Did you say something? What did you do? 

1831
02:12:11,720 --> 02:12:14,720
We did it while you were distracted. 

1832
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:17,760
Isn't it aga? Yes. Murat said the dishes. 

1833
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:19,560
I trust Murat's taste. 

1834
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,390
What did you say, Murat? 

1835
02:12:24,760 --> 02:12:26,910
We thought everyone would eat fish. 

1836
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:30,260
Ah, there are crunchy calamari, butter shrimp, ... 

1837
02:12:30,260 --> 02:12:32,920
... grilled octopus. 

1838
02:12:33,410 --> 02:12:34,740
Everything else. 

1839
02:12:47,420 --> 02:12:50,830
Bravo. You are not showing anything blessed! You ate the worlds. 

1840
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:52,120
Take a break. 

1841
02:12:52,610 --> 02:12:54,910
Murat is such a person, but Barlas. 

1842
02:12:55,220 --> 02:12:58,630
Take the worlds, nobody knows. 

1843
02:13:03,830 --> 02:13:06,680
Actually, I wasn't expecting it either. Really.

1844
02:13:17,570 --> 02:13:20,500
Do you not eat such food at home? 

1845
02:13:21,050 --> 02:13:23,600
But the man is right, honey. Everything ... 

1846
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:25,060
... so delicious. It is not? 

1847
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:29,970
Yasemin, I'm sorry dear. You're a great cook, but ... 

1848
02:13:30,050 --> 02:13:32,360
... the taste of the outside is always more appealing. 

1849
02:13:32,360 --> 02:13:33,820
There's nothing to do. 

1850
02:13:39,130 --> 02:13:40,130
Is that so? 

1851
02:13:43,270 --> 02:13:46,230
People get bored of eating the same food all the time. 

1852
02:13:46,280 --> 02:13:48,950
He wants to eat something from time to time. 

1853
02:13:48,950 --> 02:13:52,290
Whatever you do, keep doing the same thing. Dig in! Dig in! 

1854
02:13:52,290 --> 02:13:53,820
Yes honey. Of course. 

1855
02:13:54,490 --> 02:13:56,930
.. must try different things outside. 

1856
02:13:56,930 --> 02:13:58,880
Isn't that right, Murat? 

1857
02:14:02,560 --> 02:14:05,970
Well, I don't like it very much, but ... 

1858
02:14:05,970 --> 02:14:06,970
... the food here was really great. 

1859
02:14:07,590 --> 02:14:10,430
- Oh, don't let Yasemin listen! - Why my dear? You listened.

1860
02:14:10,430 --> 02:14:12,200
It is always good to increase competition. 

1861
02:14:24,160 --> 02:14:25,590
Are you okay, Yasemin? 

1862
02:14:26,300 --> 02:14:28,930
I think your friends are not trustworthy. 

1863
02:14:30,060 --> 02:14:31,190
what do you mean? 

1864
02:14:32,790 --> 02:14:36,130
They may know everything and keep it from you, Yasemin. 

1865
02:14:42,760 --> 02:14:43,760
Yasemin? 

1866
02:14:48,980 --> 02:14:49,980
Yasemin? 

1867
02:14:51,630 --> 02:14:52,980
Are you okay? 

1868
02:14:54,450 --> 02:14:55,580
No. I am not. 

1869
02:14:58,600 --> 02:15:01,500
As long as you continue to act like this ... 

1870
02:15:01,750 --> 02:15:03,340
... it won't be good. 

1871
02:15:06,610 --> 02:15:08,040
Yasemin, what is happening? 

1872
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:14,990
What happened my Aydan ... 

1873
02:15:16,010 --> 02:15:17,470
Murat is cheating on me. 

1874
02:15:17,970 --> 02:15:20,190
And everyone knows it.
