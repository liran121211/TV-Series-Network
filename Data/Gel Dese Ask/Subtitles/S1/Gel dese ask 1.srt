1
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,060
I came. 

2
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,500
You're late. 

3
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,420
My work is long, my dear, the whole house smells of broccoli. 

4
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,179
I made you meat with puree. 

5
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,380
My dear wife was also thinking about her husband. 

6
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,755
What was this now? 

7
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:51,325
What was it? 

8
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:55,185
I stayed like that, Yasemin, I wanted to kiss you, you left. 

9
00:02:55,185 --> 00:02:56,185
I didn't see it, honey. 

10
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,540
That's all? 

11
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,540
How much, what are you saying, Murat, I don't understand what you want, what are you saying? 

12
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,080
I want my wife, Yasemin, my wife. 

13
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,640
I have a job, can't you see Murat? 

14
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,140
I see it, I see it fine, but there is a problem. 

15
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,520
You can't see that you haven't looked me in the face since I came here. Yasemin. 

16
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,420
What do you want, Murat, am I cooking? You can see?

17
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,140
Mrs. Filiz couldn't come, I cleaned all the windows in the house, then Ece came, there was a fever at school ... 

18
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,740
1 hour I tried to lower her fever an hour later ... 

19
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,440
I got deep, I want broccoli. 

20
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,120
Ece can't eat broccoli, he doesn't eat potatoes like Derin Ece loves. 

21
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,120
You don't like French fries the way Ece likes meat ... 

22
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,100
he doesn't mash how you want, Murat cooked for all of you and all of this .. 

23
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,519
If I can't finish in half an hour, you'll start telling you. 

24
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:22,500
Look, I burned my finger, meanwhile my back hurt, but did I have a cold or will you stop and understand? 

25
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,600
I didn't even have a minute and if I couldn't entertain you in all of this. 

26
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,539
Sorry, Murat, don't look at my fault.

27
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:42,860
It's over, I didn't ask you to entertain me, Yasemin, I didn't ask you for anything. 

28
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:54,720
But you are right, I have the irregularity, because when you are in this state I came to help you. 

29
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:02,480
I'm trying to support you, I'm trying to hold you, my gratitude to you. 

30
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,860
I'm trying to prove that I'm Yasemin, I'm trying to love you. 

31
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:23,200
But you are right God, damn it, Yasemin, may Allah be my misery. 

32
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:31,600
So, even in this case, I can't believe there is Murat fad, you do. 

33
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:47,740
What will happen? Will everything be corrected? Come on, let's hug, okay, okay, or are we happy? 

34
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:00,120
We are happy, we are happy. 

35
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,739
Come here, mommy, a little like your fever's down. 

36
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,880
Hurrah! 

37
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,940
But it can reappear, so what are we not doing?

38
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,240
We don't jump. 

39
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,780
We don't jump, yeah mom. 

40
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,600
So can I go to school? 

41
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:44,939
36.6 very good, lamb. 

42
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,040
School ... 

43
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,640
One more day but I need a lot of help at home, you see that they still wake up. 

44
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,580
I wake up. 

45
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,760
Let's go then my lamb, without running. 

46
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,920
Where did a fairy come from in the morning? 

47
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,120
Heaven. 

48
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:59,580
The air fairy came here or waited, let me look at that fairy, let me look good then; Let me kiss ... 

49
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,140
I'm better. 

50
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:15,060
Then I can kiss one more time, this bed is very comfortable, after that I will sleep here. 

51
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,060
No father. 

52
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,700
Why not? 

53
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,880
You did not have your feet come out. 

54
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:34,100
But it is very airy, very beautiful. There will be a lot of fairy air. Go.

55
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:45,680
1, 2, 3 flew flew flew flew flew. 

56
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:54,540
Derin. You have to get up, my dear lamb. 

57
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,200
My mom says I'm going to sleep in the afternoon. 

58
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:06,260
Okay, so you can study the exam, let's see laziness. There is very little left for the exam. 

59
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:14,400
Thanks mom or if you don't remind me of the morning and morning exam. 

60
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,740
Actually it will happen, but my mother who says "you are not" eating the meat of my head to go to work? 

61
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,439
How's it going? 

62
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:36,155
It's almost finished. 

63
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,740
Your father will love this surprise, you know? 

64
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:50,600
Let's see 15 minutes or that breakfast will be ready, let's see. 

65
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,605
He flew, he flew, he flew, my daughter flew. 

66
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,840
Ece, Ece. 

67
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,840
Mom, I'm flying. 

68
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,079
Look Yasemin. 

69
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,820
Murat, that's enough.

70
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:51,000
My daughter, did you wash your face, darling, are we going to run? 

71
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,880
Please don't yell at me next to the kids again. 

72
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,900
Murat, Ece ill; Ece has a problem with his heart, okay ... 

73
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,140
If you act on this situation, I don't have to yell. 

74
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,980
I know I am aware that my daughter is ill, Yasemin, my daughter too ... 

75
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,140
... but we can't end like this. 

76
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,939
However, I can make him sicker. 

77
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,880
But I can not provide, I am a father, I can not put my son? 

78
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,960
For this, you must first be aware of the situation. 

79
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,720
What situation. 

80
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,020
This situation also requires some responsibility, these are the things that Murat does not like. 

81
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,640
Do you know what Yasemin's real pain is? 

82
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,060
What?

83
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:50,000
You feed on this, yes, you feed on this disease. 

84
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,620
I didn't hear anything stupid, stupid in my life. 

85
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:03,260
Look very smart, very smart Yasemin looks at Ece playing with these babies and you are playing with Ece .. 

86
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,000
The disease is also an excuse because it does not tolerate that he separates from you and is independent. 

87
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,080
Because you do not tolerate anything that is out of your control. 

88
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:23,240
Nothing nothing. Ece he's sick of nothing, nothing, nothing, you. 

89
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,680
Breakfast is ready for 15 minutes and is announced to those who want to eat their hot bread. 

90
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,719
Damn. 

91
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:53,440
Stay, let's see, the young people are in the hands of cotton, wake up, today I am going to meet a gentleman. 

92
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,120
Take a cab and check it out. 

93
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,640
Bahar, the man hasn't called you in years.

94
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,900
Does your father know? 

95
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:06,120
Exactly, dear. Come on, let me see, cotton hands. Go Go. 

96
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,579
My daughter is going like this, does the man not even know? 

97
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,700
What I am going to do? I'll send a letter from the front. 

98
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,280
My daughter put your head on the man, what you know is your father. 

99
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,140
Look what you know, look what you see, you see the photo; my dad in this photo .. 

100
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,319
Next to me is my mother, and me her belly. 

101
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,100
Do you understand me, this man is my father? 

102
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:37,959
Look, this man is my father, this man will find me today. 

103
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:07,440
Take it, I'll tell you how many times or not I want a tablet phone on this breakfast table. 

104
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:14,898
Mom, how much fun did you have? I wish it was a great celebration. 

105
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,840
No, it was not a fun party as it appeared in the photos.

106
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,880
Our party will be more fun, isn't it mom? 

107
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:30,900
Yes, mom, but we are not breaking the surprise. 

108
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,320
What surprise is that? 

109
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,140
Nothing. 

110
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,101
Good morning my daughter. 

111
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:38,520
Good morning Dad. 

112
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:46,040
I think I am faced with a treacherous conspiracy of three women. 

113
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,900
Could be. 

114
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,740
Thanks . 

115
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,160
Nice don't know who drew. 

116
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,220
Sitare put it. 

117
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,140
Can you send me this dear? 

118
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,260
You can get it from its own page. 

119
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:11,940
I said deep now, I don't want this, I don't want a laptop. 

120
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,180
Mom, we were looking. 

121
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:30,399
My daughter says that your mother is right, the rule is my daughter, everything has a correct time ... 

122
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,200
I'm going for half an hour, my daughter, I'll leave you if you want. 

123
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,879
Ok dad.

124
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,260
Quick recovery, do I have a meeting? 

125
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,780
OK Daddy. 

126
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:48,300
I told you to give your ring to Murat or to give it to your ring. 

127
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,940
Yasemin falls just off my finger, you're weakened, I guess they should catch her. 

128
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:04,179
Not because of that, there is no need to shrink from the air, it gets boring in hot weather ... 

129
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,780
I'll take it and it will disappear here now. 

130
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,399
Ağa I dropped a girl, there are Turkish delight. 

131
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,480
Barlas, brother, let me know that one day you will be in very bad trouble. 

132
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,180
No, Ağa, nothing will happen to you. 

133
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:06,560
Of course, your situation is different, it is normal that the diapers do not have diapers. 

134
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,300
I say how it goes, I say the traditional surprise birthday preparations.

135
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:22,120
Don't ask, Barlas, the whispers started behind me, a whisper at home and I'm going to go crazy. 

136
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,080
I swear I'm overwhelmed. 

137
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:31,419
Well, you say I got stuck, tell me Yasemin, if we are not surprised this year, what about the boss? 

138
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,460
He passed, that's his thing, Barlas, don't you know Yasemin? 

139
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:43,000
Made him a joy for life, I'm afraid he will destroy himself every year, regret. 

140
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,940
Women have toys Ağa she likes how Antin Kuntin works. 

141
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:56,340
Look what I'll say, when the meeting is over, I run away. You accompany me today, then whatever language you want from me. 

142
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,139
What about the Barlas reports? 

143
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:04,800
You say the reports, the girl said: «Come on», says Barlas, isn't it said that she will come now?

144
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:13,460
I will say that you do not understand anything of such situations, of course, the hungry does not understand. 

145
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:21,260
Yours is always the same menu, I always say you have to cry, you are a handsome man ... 

146
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,520
You need to learn to fish. 

147
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,660
What was this fish? 

148
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:33,980
Daddy client, he told Murat. Connecting customers is like fishing. 

149
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,560
Hey, don't believe. 

150
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,840
Come easy, I was going to meet with Barlas Pusat. 

151
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,340
Sure, did you have a date? 

152
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,480
It was fine, but there was no meeting ... 

153
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,480
Unfortunately. 

154
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,100
But I have to find myself. 

155
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,179
So what should I say? 

156
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,380
Also for the blind of your hand. 

157
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,480
Ercan. 

158
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,540
Forgiveness. 

159
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,719
Oh sorry, I think he seemed like a friend to me. 

160
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:21,320
Well, we compare it to Kıvanç Tatlıtuğ or something like that.

161
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,679
You are working here. 

162
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,260
Yes. 

163
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:32,960
It was cool, by the way, how cool a card is or was it, I always wondered ... 

164
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,320
Can I do it once, how was it done? 

165
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,320
That's. 

166
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:49,120
It's amazing, can you do it again or stop it this time? 

167
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,780
It always seemed strange to me. 

168
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,840
It actually has a very easy mechanism. 

169
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,360
By the way, do you know Barlas Bey? 

170
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,100
What happened to the export reports for the last three years, Barlas? 

171
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,540
I don't know, Murat was the last to look, dad. 

172
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Why is that? 

173
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,740
When I was dealing with stocks, I transferred Murat to that business so he wouldn't be delayed. 

174
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,280
Don't worry, I'm getting ready. 

175
00:23:18,915 --> 00:23:21,435
Fine fine fine if you mind

176
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,640
Dad, if you have nothing to say to me, I will not go out ... 

177
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,565
Leave it at that, how is Sitare? 

178
00:23:28,565 --> 00:23:34,580
Good dad is great, he misses you, of course, because you are staying in a country house. 

179
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,820
Barlas, I say what we are going to do Sitare because you are working hard on my site. 

180
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,014
Will these reports be ready for tomorrow now, Murat? 

181
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:43,015
We can do it. 

182
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,380
Well. 

183
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,000
Dad, if you have nothing to say to me, I will go to a client I have to go to. 

184
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,880
You need to catch new fish. 

185
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,100
Why isn't this Honor coming to you, isn't it over yet, or is school over? 

186
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,074
Months have passed from America. 

187
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,179
You're right, I'm telling you dad, but it looks good on me ... 

188
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,860
It's his job, he'll be the boss of this place.

189
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,980
You're right, I'm talking again daddy, I try to convince. 

190
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:15,300
Speak up, don't confront me with these problems, or everyone will be heartbroken. 

191
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:20,840
Ok dad I got it, then I went out, anyway I let the report work easily. 

192
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:29,120
What are we going to do and what are we not going to do? Is there nothing for you? And it works because he works hard. 

193
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,879
Getting ready, don't worry, it will be ready tomorrow. 

194
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,040
Let me tell you, Murat, I trust you, son, look at the whole initiative. 

195
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,060
I'll be out soon, is there anything you can tell me? 

196
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,919
No, just don't worry, I'll prepare everything. 

197
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,900
Well okay, easy. 

198
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,520
If your phone. 

199
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:03,240
They closed the reports on me again, I'll come late at night, don't wait for dinner. 

200
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,900
Ok honey. 

201
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,060
Does anyone ask?

202
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,700
You have a guest inside. 

203
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,640
Who? 

204
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,840
Honestly, I don't know, Barlas Bey was a lady. 

205
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,980
I don't know, Barlas Bey, what exactly do you do in this company? 

206
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,040
I tried to avoid it, but I sat down. 

207
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Sit down. 

208
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,800
Finally welcome. 

209
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:22,980
When you say welcome, we are in my office; I'll essentially say welcome, we meet somewhere ... 

210
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,116
I think I'd remember if we met from the ground. 

211
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:33,860
True, but I'm not a foreigner, dear, don't be afraid of Ümraniye. 

212
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:39,699
We can also say that the daughter of Semos, the girl of Sema. 

213
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:47,640
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, I should say something; dad? 

214
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,320
How is your mother? 

215
00:26:52,415 --> 00:26:53,415
Well. 

216
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,720
Are you still doing it? 

217
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,240
What work? 

218
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Prostitute.

219
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,860
You do it when you leave him out with the boy like a bastard, what do you do? 

220
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,480
I know this game. 

221
00:27:19,435 --> 00:27:20,435
Is that so? 

222
00:27:24,395 --> 00:27:25,680
Can you tell me? 

223
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,220
Let me explain, your mother sent you here. 

224
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:35,120
No, now I can move on my own, I grew up, I became a big girl. 

225
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:45,520
However, these tricks are a little out of the year 2020, you have to be a little more creative. 

226
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,540
Your mother sent you here. 

227
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,460
Let. 

228
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,840
What happened, you were so cool. 

229
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,379
I said let it go 

230
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:03,340
Scream and call and don't break my irritation, now go back to that hole no matter which hole you came from. 

231
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:12,600
Otherwise, I will burn you and your mother. 

232
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
What the hell are you looking at? 

233
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,800
The number you are calling is not used.

234
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,580
You don't say that Yasemin is searching, but she brings water from a thousand streams, Ruhi. 

235
00:28:54,540 --> 00:29:01,720
My brother will not be a messenger, said Yasemin, shake his mouth and I will check; now meat or fish. 

236
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,360
What should I know when I have such a problem? 

237
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,139
Look at me, Yasemin won't know I'm asking this question like that, right? 

238
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,380
Or the same thing every year is Ruhi the same thing every year my brother .. 

239
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,640
Is this a surprise, or are you a maniac or are you trying to drive me crazy? 

240
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,260
The meat is not bad, but I think it can be fish. 

241
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,040
God what is this, I did not tell you moment. 

242
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
Come on, make up your mind bro. 

243
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,320
Everything will happen, everything will be spiritual. 

244
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,720
But which? 

245
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,640
Spiritual. I'll call you later, bro, it's okay or something important.

246
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,060
I am asking a simple question, which one? 

247
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,740
It doesn't matter if you choose the spirit, I'll call you, Ruhi. 

248
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:23,700
Meat is not bad meat, okay, I know what if it's fish? 

249
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,940
Mr. Murat. 

250
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,940
Then please. 

251
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,060
Stop, please. 

252
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
What should I not do? 

253
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,680
Don't move, I'll come to you slowly. 

254
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,080
Why are you a cop or something? 

255
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,120
No I'm not a cop, but will you keep jumping? 

256
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,800
Look what you have experienced is not a problem, suicide is not a solution. 

257
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:53,360
Turns out, you mean it because of the shoes, but don't be afraid. 

258
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:58,340
I won't kill myself, my shoes just fell off. 

259
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,200
Are you sure? 

260
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,460
Absolutely, even let me tell you this. If I found my father here today ...

261
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:14,940
If he makes fun of me, I still don't throw myself, why am I going to throw myself? 

262
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,620
Oh, anyway, it doesn't matter. 

263
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,860
Are you afraid of heights? 

264
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:36,360
Let's not say that, let's say I don't feel safe. You are obviously not afraid. 

265
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:44,120
No, I am not afraid, I have my shoes back with my prince. 

266
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,500
Yes. 

267
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,540
Thank you, by the way, you two are excellent. 

268
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,260
I mean, if I throw myself, you'll catch me. 

269
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
Probably. 

270
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,240
Don't be afraid, don't worry, I won't kill myself, at least not today. 

271
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:06,600
Okay, okay, will you come back for me a little, please? 

272
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,340
If you're not going to jump, what are you doing here? 

273
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,940
Ask a question, why? 

274
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,940
Why? 

275
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,320
That is why I am treating my inferiority complex. 

276
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,140
How? 

277
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Sight.

278
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,600
I'm really scared, don't do it. 

279
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:30,780
Look at these people, they are smaller, the higher you go, the smaller they are. 

280
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,300
Stupid problems, both themselves and their created ones, fall apart. 

281
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,940
Ay Şeker, my doctor's job. I went back five years in five minutes. 

282
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,060
What did you say? 

283
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,520
Coffee, stop, I'll tell you too. 

284
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Let me see. 

285
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,880
It seems there is no difference when I look. 

286
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:23,040
Ay Yasemin, you do not understand these works, look alive, his skin officially glowed. 

287
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,920
It seems a bit bloated to me. 

288
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,060
As it is the first day, it lasts a few days. 

289
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:34,860
We're making an appointment for me right away, Sitare. 

290
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,560
That job is my sweet, come on, don't worry about the date.

291
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:46,300
Let Yasemin do it too, her skin glows, vitamin, this is nothing ... 

292
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:51,179
Let's get botox there and there, they will be very beautiful balls, very pretty. 

293
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:56,600
There is no need, I am so good, I am peaceful with my age, wrinkle. 

294
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:05,920
Honey, the important thing is that you don't like it. Whether your husband likes it or not, they don't like it, of course. 

295
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,060
It is true, the young woman is full, they give her the husband. 

296
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,160
Aa, I don't think Murat likes it very much. 

297
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,560
Yasemin says that men love naturally but for some reason they always go for hormones. 

298
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:32,100
There is no sugar, these are love events, but if they have those sweets, I love them. 

299
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,180
Where do they come from? 

300
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,580
Bag. 

301
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
Take it. 

302
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,260
You say that coffee is good for all kinds of breakdowns.

303
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,520
Yes, it is better to go up the mountain and to the roof when you feel depressed. 

304
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,060
What am I supposed to do? 

305
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,500
For example, the wind that disperses your hair is probably. 

306
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:11,200
There is also that, but more than anything the feeling of escape. 

307
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:16,920
So let's call me freedom, in short, so that no one can touch me here. 

308
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:25,800
Freedom, as I know, is unlikely in this world, so it doesn't matter how free you want to be. 

309
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:31,160
True, how could anyone know who worked in the possession of a three-cent salary day and night? 

310
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,379
Well, what kind of freedom does this freedom look at? 

311
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:48,280
Freedom, freedom, that's it, look at this ... 

312
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:55,700
Freedom to fly like this kite, no one can reach it, looking from the sky.

313
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,940
Think about it, what would you feel when you fly a kite? 

314
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,959
I don't know, how would I feel? Have I never made a kite? 

315
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,940
What, in childhood? Are you honestly a person who doesn't fly a kite? 

316
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,520
You need an ultimate kite, add it to your to-do list before you die. 

317
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,740
Look, I cannot explain this feeling to you, it is such a thing, it is experienced as soon as it is told. 

318
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,220
Can I give you another little secret? 

319
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,299
I do not receive three cents of salary, I am one of the bosses of this place. 

320
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,080
Wow, the second boss I met today was fine. 

321
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,900
Actually, your songwriting is really great, but it didn't work, it doesn't suit my voice, it's strident. 

322
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,020
If I transpose, even though all the air in the song will disappear, I can't change it.

323
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,635
What am I going to do now? 

324
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:11,020
I wanted to help, but unfortunately, I need to catch up with the class now, and shall we talk? 

325
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,140
OK thank you. 

326
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,320
Onur, what is it, what are you doing? 

327
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,780
Derin, what happened, why is your voice bad? 

328
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,259
I'm in big trouble, I don't know what to do with this song. 

329
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,040
Are you at school? 

330
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,200
Yes, and I'm about to freak out. 

331
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,400
Okay, calm down, we'll solve the problem, I'm coming. 

332
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,240
Were you really in business? 

333
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,160
I said I'm coming. 

334
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,520
OK thank you. 

335
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,600
What did you do with my candy birthday organization? Are you working with the same company again? 

336
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,600
They made me very sad last year. 

337
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,080
I say I'll handle it on my own this year. 

338
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,760
Oh, you're crazy, how will you catch up?

339
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,820
Let me give you the number of my company, call and speak, my sweet is clear. 

340
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,980
Are you saying that, is it a great idea at the same time ...? 

341
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:46,580
No, how Murat wants cake now, what color do you want on the tablecloths? 

342
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:55,040
Love is such, what are you doing, in the night of sleep, you ask the man what to eat, what to drink? 

343
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,820
Thanks to Ruhi. 

344
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,320
What did you do with the gift business? Did you call Murat's mouth? 

345
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,419
No, but I know what to do. I found a very romantic idea. 

346
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,299
What is it? 

347
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:13,340
Now there is a poem that Murat wrote to me, twenty years ago, when we met. 

348
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:21,700
Derin composed in song, he will play at the party, he found a friend from school, he works. 

349
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,520
What's so romantic about this? 

350
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,160
Isn't it romantic?

351
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:34,460
It's not romance, not passionate sugar, I need a little passion. 

352
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:40,720
That's right, you have to think of something for the night. What a fiery thing. 

353
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:49,900
After all, we're not sixteen, are we? 

354
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,160
Well. 

355
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,660
Terrible, I have to take a break more often. 

356
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:09,780
I think you are not only tired, but also sad, what happened? 

357
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,220
Nothing happened. 

358
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:24,080
It's true, I feel more like mine, yours is a bit more like more unhappiness. 

359
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:41,480
As if there is a deep void in your heart, they are covered everywhere with dark clouds. 

360
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,779
There is no such thing, where do you get it from? 

361
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:50,900
It is not so important that you lie to me, you are lying to yourself, it is a little bad. 

362
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,840
I'm not unhappy, where do you get it from?

363
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,819
So you are an unhappy guy, so we say boring. 

364
00:41:59,360 --> 00:41:59,900
So much. 

365
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,360
How could you not breathe through those dark clouds? 

366
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,220
But you cannot realize that your soul is withdrawn. 

367
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,960
I realized when you said it. 

368
00:42:11,135 --> 00:42:13,385
Well, well, this is something too. 

369
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,880
Well, is there a cure for this, so can I recover? 

370
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:26,900
Actually there is, but can you do it a bit? 

371
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:34,600
You underestimate me, look, I brought your shoes from below and almost with you, despite everything ... 

372
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,060
I'm sitting here, don't underestimate me. 

373
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:44,580
That's right, you're right, then let's plan. 

374
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,900
Okay, let's go. 

375
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,280
If we forget everything. 

376
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:54,940
What? 

377
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:03,860
Past future. If we don't think anything, just feel the moment in which we live,

378
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:18,320
If we go out the moment we breathe, let us flow. Let's see what happens to us. 

379
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,620
At this time? 

380
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,000
It's ridiculous to be the boss if we can't go out anytime you want. 

381
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:46,900
You're right, you're right, let's go out. 

382
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,640
I think it's time to get rid of this damn place. 

383
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:28,680
The song is fine, I wrote it, but nobody can sing or maybe I have the problem, I couldn't do it. 

384
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,620
Sure it can be. 

385
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:36,240
What a pity. 

386
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:41,140
Of course I'm kidding, I'm sure you did a great songwriting, .. 

387
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,940
As for the say part, stop, we thought about it, we'll find someone, of course. 

388
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,940
What is born before the day comes, right?

389
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:54,220
Also that girl will regret doing this, when you become a famous songwriter in the future ... 

390
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,140
Since she lost the opportunity to work with you, she will hit her head from wall to wall. 

391
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,340
Thank you, the problem is not that important when you are here. 

392
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,680
It's not because you've been eating me in vain, since you've been trying to take advantage of me until now ... 

393
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:23,040
You're going to buy me coffee because it's not the coffee I drink. 

394
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:29,440
Well, soon we have a good place, let's go there. 

395
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,920
Well okay. 

396
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:58,060
Everything should be perfect, I do not tolerate the slightest mistake. 

397
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,920
Don't worry, I'm sure she'll please you like Ms. Sitare. 

398
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:05,140
The moon eased, I was so tired of running. 

399
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:09,180
Did you pick something from the catalog for decorations, Mrs. Yasemin?

400
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:14,440
Your options are vast but they are still items that I couldn't decide. 

401
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,560
Let me help you, how do you think this is? 

402
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:25,240
This will not happen, Murat hates blue, please take this to your notes please. 

403
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,460
I think it is beautiful. 

404
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,360
I don't like blue at all. 

405
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,480
So does blue know about this? 

406
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,560
I think it looks good on him. 

407
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,940
Well, let's drink. 

408
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,840
How much, sister? 

409
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,080
Fifty pounds. 

410
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,740
Thanks. 

411
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,420
Well, do you want to have fun or not? 

412
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:34,299
I want to, I'm not used to vacations in the middle of the day. 

413
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:42,300
Wow well it was an honor to have a half day vacation with me. 

414
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,100
Thanks to you too. 

415
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:44,880
Let out. 

416
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,100
What?

417
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,259
Before you can be free, you must get rid of your handcuffs because ... 

418
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,340
everything that chains you to the imperative, everything. 

419
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,680
So how do I learn time? 

420
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:03,500
One, this will stay with me, but don't worry, I'll give it back to you. 

421
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,500
Well. 

422
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,480
Now you can learn the weather by looking at the sun. 

423
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,860
And you haven't looked at it in a long time, get a bonus from me. 

424
00:51:51,705 --> 00:51:54,404
Take it, wafers are good for depression. 

425
00:51:55,405 --> 00:51:57,655
The bottomless pit in this bag is blessed. 

426
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,120
But I told you, I love being a nomad. 

427
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,799
When I'm so impressed, I like to go where I want to, do the things I want to do. 

428
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,840
And to eat wafers contrary to this point of view, you are not aware, but ...

429
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,040
We are looking at the most expensive vision in the world right now. 

430
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,400
Take it with courtesy. 

431
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,680
You say this view will suit wafers, right? 

432
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,200
It fits everything, so you can think like a miracle. 

433
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,420
Let's see. 

434
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,080
What happened? Didn't you eat the wafers when you were a kid? 

435
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,859
Look, this is bad. 

436
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,839
What are you doing? 

437
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,480
If you don't take advantage of the opportunities that are offered to you in life, it will be taken away. 

438
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,840
Then. 

439
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,900
So they eat the goods of not eating. 

440
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,700
Well. 

441
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,200
It's okay. Thanks. 

442
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,280
Why, because I bought the wafer? 

443
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:08,780
No, I have been in this city for forty-five years and I have never seen this face. 

444
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,580
That is good. 

445
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:19,759
Istanbul was truly the most beautiful city in the world, thank you.

446
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,920
Thanks. 

447
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,560
Can I look at the clock now? 

448
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,740
What happened now? 

449
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:45,339
Come on, let me drop you at home, there's work tomorrow. 

450
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,060
Okay, accept, but finish your wafer first. 

451
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:24,339
Take it, my phone number is; you call when you need it. 

452
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,100
Yes, or, yes what, do you have two names? 

453
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:34,420
So you don't know him, SOS is help. You can think of it as a cry for help. 

454
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,880
Well. 

455
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,220
Call when I die of boredom. 

456
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:47,060
There is much more beauty to see in this city. 

457
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,060
Won't you say your name? 

458
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:59,560
I won't say, if you call, you learn, if you don't call, it doesn't matter anyway. 

459
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:10,820
If you can't take it, why are you stumbling? And that? 

460
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:15,900
Let's be. 

461
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,140
Bahar. 

462
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,660
Mom, what happened to you? 

463
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,920
My daughter.

464
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:32,120
Come on in, damn it, or Veysel don't repeat, okay, calm down, sit down and let me look at you, stop. 

465
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:40,540
Veysel, his hands are broken, he's purple. 

466
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:47,020
Mom, how do you give permission or do you keep doing this, how? 

467
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,940
Let's see what time it is, boy. 

468
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:34,580
Yes. 

469
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:35,779
I said what time. 

470
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,259
19:00. 

471
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:42,419
That means you are in the air. 

472
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:50,160
You left the night happy because I was smiling like a baked head. 

473
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:54,940
They say there is a place to go, so it means you have to go. 

474
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:59,180
When you look at it, it is obvious that you are not going to work. 

475
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,520
How is that? 

476
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,760
Time, as precious as time, now does not want people to pass ... 

477
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:13,120
you cannot step on your feet, nor can you step on. So what should we do in this situation, our boy?

478
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,720
I do not know. 

479
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,500
You need to drink coffee. 

480
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:38,480
You need to drink coffee, sit and think, come and sit down. 

481
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,240
Thanks. 

482
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:48,700
I set it on fire, I was waiting for his share, it is not possible to have coffee alone. The smallest team is for two. 

483
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,279
So what would happen if it didn't come? 

484
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:00,740
It will be difficult for you to decide the answer, since you are always looking for it. 

485
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:09,060
Now, if we doubt your decision, I will pour the coffee into the cup. 

486
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:23,580
Hop, it will happen, but not your wish. 

487
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,279
Enjoy your meal. 

488
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:46,500
It looked really good, you're actually telling the truth. 

489
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:55,560
It's about being in the limel, so here I am like a limbo in hand. 

490
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,620
The idea of ​​going home is really like hell. 

491
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:06,460
So when you say come, love is such people.

492
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:16,440
The man is the son of Adam that you call, he seeks heaven on earth but does not know that he is looking for himself. 

493
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:23,900
The sky is not where you find it, but where it is located, maybe you know ... 

494
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:34,520
One day, Harun Reşit is so cold in the forest that Behlül asks Dana for a fire and says "Go away!" 

495
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:44,259
Bring fire, Behlül Dana is a married man, he goes to hell but remains empty ... He 

496
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:48,340
says, there was no fire in hell, everyone would take fire there ... 

497
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:54,040
Maybe this is your account, how about our boy? 

498
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,959
I am doing my best. 

499
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:05,280
Sure it is, but the story is not over yet. 

500
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:13,740
When Harun Reşit can't find fire in hell, Behlül tells Dana and enters paradise, let's see if there is one.

501
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:21,419
Behlül Dana goes to heaven and her hand becomes empty again, neither does it say in heaven or fire ... 

502
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:30,520
yes, sir, yes, but they don't give it to everyone, you and me .. 

503
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:35,880
Harun Reşit doesn't understand, he asks ; why is that? 

504
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:43,439
Lord says, do not give fire to those who are not willing to burn in the fire. 

505
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:53,600
There is no fire for you, our boy, who looks at the fire, who does not dare to burn in the fire. 

506
01:01:54,760 --> 01:02:05,160
It stands just like you, somewhere in between, no burning, no burning, you are not ready to burn .. 

507
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:11,540
You cannot go to hell, you are not ready to burn, you cannot go to heaven. 

508
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:27,640
Nice, I think I found paradise in love and living hell. You looked at what you thought was hell.

509
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:41,120
Another kingdom you call heaven, I mean human beings. I can't get up without falling down, this is an exam ... 

510
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:53,839
Let no one know that they are innocent without being proven, no one is innocent of a love that has not been proven. 

511
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,940
Murat, don't touch me. 

512
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:17,300
Yasemin, you didn't miss me too, why is it Yasemin? 

513
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,920
Why do you think? 

514
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:22,320
I am sorry. 

515
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:23,660
There's no need. 

516
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,600
I could come early last night, sorry. 

517
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:30,380
It is not necessary, I do not want your apology, it is not necessary. 

518
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:34,540
Do you hate me so much? 

519
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,800
I have a job, I'll make breakfast, will you? 

520
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,020
Wouldn't you wait for breakfast? 

521
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:53,700
I can not wait. 

522
01:05:55,180 --> 01:06:02,480
Let's make love hungry immediately, what happens without breakfast, children will not starve. 

523
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,720
Nonsense.

524
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:11,880
After we love each other, what time and place matter, my dear if we love each other. 

525
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:18,400
It exists for me, everything has a place and a time, this is the rule of life. 

526
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:27,520
If I was early last night, would everything be in line with your rules? 

527
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:35,200
Maybe I don't know, but we'll never know because of you. 

528
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:41,760
This is not a matter of last night or today, but you know it. 

529
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:48,120
Ece has been like this since he was born, I'm sure it would have been an excuse if I was early last night. 

530
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,540
Can't you see, can't you stand to touch me? 

531
01:06:56,860 --> 01:07:05,520
I can't forgive you inside of me, okay, okay, did you want to hear this? 

532
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:11,940
I'm struggling, struggling but not happening, I'll change my clothes now ... 

533
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:15,319
then I have to make breakfast.

534
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:25,580
Breakfast is important, breakfast is very important. 

535
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:36,440
Good morning darling. 

536
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:40,000
Good morning mom, isn't there grandpa? 

537
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,340
He would stay at the farm. 

538
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,700
What diet are you doing this time? 

539
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,160
I think of death. 

540
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,500
Come on, put some more. 

541
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,299
Thanks love. 

542
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,980
Mom, what happened to your lips? 

543
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:14,940
Nothing major, it will take a few days because of the procedure I had yesterday, the doctor said, but it's not a big deal. 

544
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:19,420
Come on mom, you're already beautiful, you don't need needles, botox ... 

545
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:20,700
You're in vain, doctor, doctor. 

546
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:24,080
Yes, you are right, honey. 

547
01:08:31,819 --> 01:08:36,620
I'm beautiful but it's okay to be a little more beautiful, right? 

548
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:41,940
My father hadn't woken up yet? 

549
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,460
He arrived late at night, his work was a bit long.

550
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:51,560
Of course, he is working hard these days. 

551
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:57,479
Good morning, the most beautiful woman in the world. 

552
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,160
Good Morning. 

553
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,800
What's up, lion? 

554
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:41,799
Onur, Onur. 

555
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:43,779
Mister. 

556
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:47,300
I'm calling you, you don't listen, baby, what happened? 

557
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:48,800
Nothing happened. 

558
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:57,480
This woman is not an old friend either, she is older than me. 

559
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,400
Stop, don't turn around, don't look. 

560
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:09,660
Aa comes to our Ömer Bey for a vitamin needle. What did he do? 

561
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:15,740
Stretched it out, look. 

562
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:22,960
Let's be. 

563
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:32,219
Look, it's not one, it's not two, what do you expect me to do? 

564
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,900
I don't know, Bahar. 

565
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:39,620
I don't know what it means, I don't know what it means. You give it to the court is gone. 

566
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:46,820
I am tired, believe me, I am tired, may Allah dispose of my life now.

567
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:55,000
Look at the maniac, do not talk foolishly, you put the kick, you collect your mind and you come to me ... 

568
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:04,600
I will take care of you, we are enough for each other, we do not need anyone. 

569
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,900
How do we do that in our muscles? 

570
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:12,180
It would be such a thing. 

571
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:24,240
After the beating, it becomes like cotton, it does. 

572
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:32,960
His torment does not end, of course. You are right, of course, I will stay in this man's days. 

573
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,140
Oh, you already knew. 

574
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:52,220
Semos, there is no other man in your care Veysel, okay, we will move the world with you. 

575
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,060
We, right? 

576
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:57,140
We also make a joke. 

577
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:13,880
Come on, let's have a hot soup and let me get you a cup of tea. 

578
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,200
Well. 

579
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:55,320
What are you laughing at, tell me I'm laughing?

580
01:12:55,645 --> 01:12:57,815
You tied it up to the high school teacher again. 

581
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,598
I think it would be useful for me to start working in the company. 

582
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,340
Look, you're working hard, maybe it'll help you. 

583
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:12,800
Don't worry, son, look at your details and your book. 

584
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:17,696
Why were you saying the other day that the documents were drowned and you couldn't go home? 

585
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:22,040
It is not necessary, there is no position for you in the company, boy. 

586
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,720
Are you making this decision? 

587
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:35,740
Yes, because I put the money in your pocket. Two ... I'm your father, you're not mine. 

588
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:43,060
Dad, you look more like eighteen teenagers right now. 

589
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:50,520
Your only strength is money. You're trying to scare me with this, I don't need this, but if you lose your money ...

590
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:56,500
you will be nothing, while the true power of man is family, right? 

591
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:06,920
Oh, what is the trip in the morning and in the morning, what kind of attitude is this, if you finish, I will be late for work? 

592
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:15,020
Maybe you need to lose everything to understand the value of family, what do you say, dad? 

593
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:33,880
Bahar, can we talk? 

594
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:41,299
Mr. Onur, could you call me? Last time it hung in my face. 

595
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:46,060
I don't have brothers like you, my father doesn't do anything like that, what happened? 

596
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:52,160
Please listen to me, okay, I didn't take you seriously at first, but decided to give you a chance. 

597
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:58,120
God, what is it, you fell on your head or something. What happened suddenly you decided to believe me. 

598
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:01,940
You can say it, Bahar, I'll give you the chance of a lifetime. 

599
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:06,160
Tell me what that opportunity is and I will know.

600
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,940
Wait for news from me, find me where I will write you the place and time today, you will learn ... 

601
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:17,780
I have a great plan, I think you are right, it is time for my father to pay the price for what he did. 

602
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:48,880
This is great news, a great burden has been lifted and we will see you, thank you. 

603
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,000
What was the burden of this? 

604
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Is my father away? 

605
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:55,540
Is the output about the song? 

606
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,800
Yes, my friend from school yesterday stopped singing the song. 

607
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:04,260
I was saying we were screwed, but Onur's friend will sing the song. 

608
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:08,559
The girl is called Bahar, and I will go to see her because of her voice. 

609
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:14,340
This is wonderful, great news, and yesterday I signed up with the Sitare organizing company. 

610
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:16,520
We will celebrate for a long time. 

611
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:19,120
Or everyone will be fascinated.

612
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,380
I'll go on stage too, sing with the singing sister. 

613
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:28,940
You are going to give us a special concert. 

614
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:37,940
Derin, I don't understand these musical works, but if you want, let me talk to the girl about money. 

615
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:41,655
It would be great or I don't understand money. 

616
01:16:41,655 --> 01:16:46,380
Let me go today, speak first, then speak after you speak. 

617
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:55,700
Be careful not to press fast, fast, don't you take with your hand, Derin take your sister? 

618
01:16:55,740 --> 01:17:03,139
Come on, okay, okay, you should pay attention to your hand before the test. 

619
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:29,799
Girl are you leaving? 

620
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,760
I have a small job, Semos. 

621
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:32,916
You're not too late, are you? 

622
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:38,160
- Do I ever stay, girl? Don't worry, I'm with you as soon as I'm done. - Well. 

623
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,440
You go to sleep, rest now.

624
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:30,820
Now you will sing your normal song at the party and do your job as if nothing happened after the song. 

625
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:37,580
First I will introduce you to my mother and then I will explode the bomb, look, my grandfather and my mother ... will 

626
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:41,720
you be there when you tell the situation besides them ... 

627
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:46,200
Will everyone hug me and suddenly praise me? 

628
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:51,599
At least we will put an end to my father's deception, the facts will have been revealed. 

629
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:53,620
What happened? 

630
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:55,960
I do not understand. 

631
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:58,520
I was running after him trying to tell you ... 

632
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,559
I went to the gym to get closer, I went to the gym and did the abdominal muscle ... 

633
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:08,000
And you have not believed me for months, then you open the phone one morning and you tell me that you will have a winged arm . 

634
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,140
I also ask what happened naturally.

635
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:18,340
Whatever happens, are you with me or not? Tell me. 

636
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:27,780
I don't know, if you are sincere when you say that you are with me ... be sure ... 

637
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:30,760
What did Sema do to his wife? 

638
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:35,460
No, the wife is in the middle, brother, they have moved, they say nobody knows. 

639
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:43,440
You will find, I give you tons of money, no matter what hole it enters. 

640
01:20:55,980 --> 01:21:20,240
It looks very good, if it says come, if it says love, come, I will come to your love. 

641
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:30,200
I will die if you say die, die for your love. 

642
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,960
You even did a duet. 

643
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:38,320
You probably forgot that Master Muhammer left my classroom as soon as he heard my voice. 

644
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,100
I think it was unfair. 

645
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:43,720
Which Muammer, by the way, is your left key Muammer? 

646
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:49,640
What are you up to? He called me crows or something. Do not worry about it.

647
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:54,800
Are you in our school? It was awesome. Why haven't I seen you before? 

648
01:21:56,820 --> 01:22:02,820
I haven't been visiting for two years, so there wasn't much time for extras; if you just entered. 

649
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:10,799
Yeah, never mind, they don't teach anything properly anyway, and I say if I quit. 

650
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:14,800
Are you serious why? 

651
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,240
Yes. 

652
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:22,700
Oh dear, don't rush, maybe I'll go back to school ... 

653
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:27,840
Is it okay if I already have a friend? 

654
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:29,960
So you are thinking of going back. 

655
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:36,620
So there is a little money problem that I have to deal with, even if I solve it, I will even do it to the doctor. 

656
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:46,000
How beautiful, my dear, don't get bored then. 

657
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,800
Super, your composition, I help you at that moment .. 

658
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,860
We read the left key of Muhammer. 

659
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:16,380
Yes, Yasemin.

660
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:22,540
Murat, we left the doctor, Ece's test results are fine, we're comfortable for now ... 

661
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:25,060
So I wanted to let you know. 

662
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:30,660
Oh, I'm so happy, okay, let's celebrate, let's go to dinner together. 

663
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:36,900
Nerd. Let's not break Ece's sleep pattern now, let's do it some other time. 

664
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:38,500
You are two steps away. 

665
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:40,420
Let's go to my father. 

666
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:43,320
We talk, we look, we look at the flowers. 

667
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,360
Ece wants too, look, I'll come. 

668
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:51,099
No, don't do it now, don't insist today. 

669
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:56,380
You're punishing me, is it morning Yasemin? 

670
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,220
Don't be silly Murat, what does he have to do? 

671
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:03,940
How and what has to do, I know you, you get to the bottom ... 

672
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:08,419
But I'm mad at you, you say I don't want to be side by side, Yasemin ...

673
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,360
You're taking revenge on me, don't do it. 

674
01:24:11,545 --> 01:24:14,525
No, I just wanted to tell you that I called him. 

675
01:24:15,225 --> 01:24:16,225
Of course, if you say so. 

676
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:22,360
Now we have a lot of work and I will not interrupt the program. 

677
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,580
Okay Yasemin, okay. 

678
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:27,980
Let's go with daddy, mommy. 

679
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:30,559
We can't go, honey, your father has a lot of work to do. 

680
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:50,460
My handsome partner, I should take it, where did you put the reports? 

681
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:52,480
Sorry, I couldn't prepare it yet. 

682
01:24:54,260 --> 01:25:02,380
What happened to my workaholic Murat, what did you do? 

683
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:07,100
What do you have to do, brother? Can't I breathe, brother? 

684
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:18,019
Alright mate, we're not used to it now, so I asked him, are you okay, huh? 

685
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:21,240
I'm a little tired, Barlas. 

686
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:25,860
Brother, what are you sitting on? Get up, go home, get up at your home.

687
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:29,760
Look at the reports later, rest at home; what will you do here. 

688
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:37,560
I'm at the company, I'm looking at work, don't worry about that health, you need us, my handsome brother. 

689
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,880
Thanks. 

690
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:59,420
Bahar is cute, where do you meet? 

691
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:07,500
From there, a friend of a friend actually called our organization, but then it didn't happen. 

692
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:10,460
Fortunately it was our job. 

693
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:18,440
I'm so glad you got along, why did you mention dropping out of school? 

694
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:25,500
So I don't know, I'm not sure I want to play the piano. 

695
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:30,220
So it seems that being a pianist in this country is too much. 

696
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:36,521
Yes, I heard your lies, Mrs. Now tell me what really happened. 

697
01:26:36,521 --> 01:26:39,599
Because something very specific has happened, you are not telling me.

698
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:46,840
I don't know if this is a problem, but my hands have been numb for a while. 

699
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,580
Your hand is numb, did you tell your mother? 

700
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:55,360
No, my mother is broke, panic attack environment at home or something. 

701
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:55,860
You went to the doctor? 

702
01:26:56,100 --> 01:27:01,960
Stop now, the doctor is not an important thing, and I am so tired of the exams. 

703
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:03,140
Maybe that's why. 

704
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,360
Don't be silly, let's take a look, we won't tell your mother. 

705
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,900
Ok, let me rest a bit, if it doesn't go away, we'll go. 

706
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:15,220
Please. 

707
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:20,020
Okay, but I'm on follow-up. 

708
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:52,900
Semoş Semoş Semoş, look what I bought you, I even found a pumpkin, that Veysel, also a candle for you. 

709
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:59,719
Where are you, let's be?

710
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:19,020
Veysel brother came, he begged a lot, we will return to the house that he will not do it again. 

711
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:33,960
Ah, I know Semos, why did you go to that shove again? I would protect you, why did you leave me again? 

712
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:50,720
Sal, the idiot woman, she likes to hit or beloved, girl you, beloved, you deserve it ... 

713
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:55,860
Insert them in the bottom of the boy, break his nose. You are right, I am a greeting. 

714
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:01,160
Thank you very much, Mrs. Filiz. 

715
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:07,200
Wait, let's see, wash your hands and then look at your room. 

716
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,639
But I'll go out into the garden. 

717
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:13,600
Ece, dear, please, whatever I say you will do, don't bother me. 

718
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:17,660
Don't make me sad, Mom, don't make me sad. 

719
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:24,200
Let's do this, grab the new crayons, paint well behaved. 

720
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,540
We will play runner.

721
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:30,260
No mother, no Ece, no, you know. 

722
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:35,840
No, the doctor said no, I always paint, I always play with the baby, I want to run. 

723
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:38,340
But Ece'ci ... 

724
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:41,700
You do n't allow anything, mother, you always say well. 

725
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:47,400
Be nice and be mad at you, don't come to my room. It is forbidden for you. 

726
01:30:10,925 --> 01:30:11,935
Here you are. 

727
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,420
They left you a package, Murat Bey. 

728
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:27,280
God, what is this? 

729
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:32,760
I don't know, they said it was SOS. I think the company. 

730
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:33,820
What did they say? 

731
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:34,880
SOS. 

732
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:36,180
Well. 

733
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:09,527
You can fly this yourself if you want, you can fly with me on Caddebostan beach at 4 o'clock. 

734
01:31:09,528 --> 01:31:12,060
But definitely fly, don't miss your childhood. 

735
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:34,639
You are punishing me well, Yasemin, for what happened in the morning, don't make me sad, mother, don't make me sad.

736
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,520
Ms. Yasemin, did something happen or did you cut yourself? 

737
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:45,360
I'm fine, Filiz, I'm going to look at Ece, can you continue? 

738
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,360
Yes. 

739
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:37,260
Ece is mad at me, how can I make it up to my daughter? 

740
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:47,219
But I never wanted to upset him, I love him so much. 

741
01:32:47,885 --> 01:32:50,465
His name is not Feride, this is Feride. 

742
01:32:51,315 --> 01:32:53,275
Excuse me, should we make amends? 

743
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:05,839
My Feride, I thought something like this. I actually have a great idea to make amends, should I say? 

744
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:16,400
I'm saying it's okay, now I'm saying let's make a great meal. 

745
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:19,700
Let's celebrate the good news from your uncle doctor. 

746
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:26,019
I also say, let's let Ece let her cook. 

747
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,620
Don't break the eggs. 

748
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:39,540
Of course, you can knead. What do you say, will Feride accept? 

749
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:41,620
Peace is then.

750
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:47,980
Shall we make amends, my Ece, my Ece? 

751
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:51,520
My dad likes it too, right mom? 

752
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:56,440
Of course he will like it, will he ever like it from your hands? Come hug me here come here? 

753
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:22,920
We go faster, you have to take the wind back, just like that. 

754
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:23,700
Is that so? 

755
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,180
A) Yes. 

756
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:34,980
It was. 

757
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:36,200
How? 

758
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:37,160
So beautiful. 

759
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,160
I did it. 

760
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:42,900
This is a wonderful thing, thank you. 

761
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:45,019
I told you, there is still a lot to do. 

762
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,679
What? 

763
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:48,680
I will tell you sometime. 

764
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:03,320
Why haven't I done this before, what? 

765
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:07,519
Excellent. 

766
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:21,560
What are you doing, why did you do it? 

767
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:23,700
I released it. 

768
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:25,360
Gone. 

769
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:30,740
I know, the life lesson is one. You can't keep everything forever. 

770
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:37,260
Come on, what are we going to do now?

771
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:40,740
We also release other kites. 

772
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:43,420
Okay, let's go. 

773
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:57,840
I did the dishes, you know, sister? 

774
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:02,840
You will be the chef with this game. Little mouse, my father will love it too. 

775
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:08,040
Cheers girls in your hands, the dishes have been wonderful. 

776
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:12,260
Should we see a movie after dinner, did Onur suggest a very nice movie? 

777
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:13,420
We will see that. 

778
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,200
Long live the food from the movie. 

779
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,760
Long live the celebrations. 

780
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:20,900
Olley. 

781
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:50,680
Thanks. 

782
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:54,400
At least I know what it's for this time. 

783
01:37:04,865 --> 01:37:06,465
Don't you want to enter? 

784
01:37:10,485 --> 01:37:11,485
I can not come. 

785
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:20,220
Why, I thought you liked it? 

786
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:36,080
That's why I can't go, I don't want to be unfair to you. 

787
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:56,480
It is unfair, how good you are, how naive you are, you are a very sweet person.

788
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:02,280
There aren't many of you married ones. 

789
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:12,519
Okay, I agree, let's not rush. 

790
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:31,220
Hey, hey, what's your name? 

791
01:38:34,220 --> 01:38:39,460
You would learn if you called me next time. 

792
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:08,960
Dad, my dad came. 

793
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:09,960
Without running. 

794
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:12,920
My daughter. 

795
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:18,900
Hello, what happened, what happened to God? 

796
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,680
Look, I did the dishes. 

797
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:26,679
Great, there's a surprise for you here. 

798
01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:29,460
Kite. 

799
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:32,640
Dad, you bought a kite. 

800
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:36,180
Darling yeah do you like it girl? 

801
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:37,300
It's mine? 

802
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:38,900
Of course, let's get one of you. 

803
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:43,900
Comet Comet Comet, hooray. 

804
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:49,400
Slow down, what is this? 

805
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:54,240
Comet dear, we will fly together, come on you come too. 

806
01:39:55,440 --> 01:40:01,080
Girls, go fill in the deficiencies of the table, I'll talk to your father. 

807
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:12,500
Comet, come on now.

808
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:17,120
But mom. 

809
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:27,280
I was so hungry, first kiss and cheek. Who is this mouse? 

810
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:35,360
Murat, you're crazy, what do you want with getting a kite for Ece, do you want to attack? 

811
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:40,860
You said the doctor said it was fine. 

812
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:44,639
The doctor said it was good, but did not say it was completely healthy. 

813
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:47,760
The doctor's word or yours? 

814
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:52,740
I am responsible for the child, not the doctor. I know what I'm doing. 

815
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:59,080
Of course you know what you are doing, Yasemin, you do the best of everything, you know the best of everything ... 

816
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:02,456
The blade cannot move without being aware of you, it does not move because if it does move ... 

817
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:07,179
Yasemin, tell it why you are a controller. 

818
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:13,160
Am I a controller, Murat? I am trying to protect ourselves.

819
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:18,780
You are not protecting us, you are strangling us all. What's going on? 

820
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:23,820
Let go a little, much less relax, something is not under your control, Yasemin .. 

821
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:30,040
A kite above six, you magnified when you magnified. 

822
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:31,620
A kite up or down? 

823
01:41:31,820 --> 01:41:32,320
Yes. 

824
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:37,179
Murat, I'm not like you, I'm not irresponsible like you ... 

825
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:41,480
Ece happened because of you, because of your thoughtlessness. 

826
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:43,960
Because you took the future away from our daughter. 

827
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:53,559
Aren't you tired of guilt, will this conversation ever end? 

828
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:59,800
It will never end, it will never end. 

829
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:04,380
I remember that day every time I look at Ece. 

830
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:11,580
I don't think I'm going to forget that you caused our daughter's illness, Murat. 

831
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:24,260
What I do is empty, what I do is empty, can't I fix my mistake?

832
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:29,940
Then God curse me, Yasemin .. 

833
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:39,660
God give me my pain, Yasemin, God give me my pain, Yasemin, God give me my pain, Yasemin ... 

834
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:45,360
- - you too relax, relax. 

835
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:26,040
Girl, your uncle Barlas called your father had to go to work in a hurry, what should we do? 

836
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:38,620
Ece happened because of you, because of your thoughtlessness, because you took the future away from our daughter ... 

837
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:42,320
I remember that day every time I look at Ece ... 

838
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:58,520
Murat, because I couldn't talk to you, our best effort to talk is that we blame each other. 

839
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:02,300
I am writing this letter because it turned into a fight. 

840
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:07,160
At least this way you judge me, I get mad at you ... 

841
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:10,000
Without these fights like I never said the things I never wanted.

842
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:17,260
I can express myself, I do not know if it is possible to repair the damage, but I will try. 

843
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:25,639
We are not new lovers, after all, we have been married for many years, we have children, 

844
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:41,980
Yes, marriage is not an amusement park, it is a refuge in war. 

845
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:46,180
I have no one else to take refuge in. 

846
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:51,000
I know you are the one I fight from time to time, this has exhausted us. 

847
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:56,020
Our excitement may have diminished, we are going through difficult times. 

848
01:45:56,020 --> 01:46:02,360
They are normal. I know we will throw them all away, we must be together, we must make our decisions together. 

849
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:05,080
I have no other wish. 

850
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:59,420
All we need is to hold on to our marriage, I believe in us. 

851
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:51,360
You are awake, mine does not make sense, you are in front of me. 

852
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:53,380
I already woke up.

853
01:47:53,380 --> 01:47:54,380
Good Morning. 

854
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:55,700
Good Morning. 

855
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:14,160
Please, I'll just look, come on, but I'm wearing a white collar. 

856
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:20,440
Keep in mind that one day I will save you from this captivity. 

857
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:25,440
It is a little difficult. 

858
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:32,540
Yes, I have some time before I go to work. 

859
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:38,380
Really, it's super, it's okay, let's plan right now, let's go have breakfast, I'm already hungry as a wolf. 

860
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:42,840
I'm sure I'll take you to a very beautiful place, you haven't had breakfast like this before. 

861
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:43,840
Well well. 

862
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:45,820
This will stay with me. 

863
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:52,080
You are the boss, what are we going to eat? 

864
01:48:52,700 --> 01:48:53,960
I'm not surprised. 

865
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:55,340
I don't eat everything. 

866
01:48:56,700 --> 01:49:00,000
No mischief, Murat Bey, you will eat. 

867
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:23,259
Ece'ci, finish playing with your plate. 

868
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:30,840
Good Morning. 

869
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:33,860
Where is my dad?

870
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:39,980
Left early, my Ece'li olives, come on. 

871
01:49:43,540 --> 01:49:47,140
Well, I already have a job and I'll go myself. 

872
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:55,920
What are you doing? Derin, what are you doing I say? 

873
01:49:56,420 --> 01:49:59,760
Mom, I said I have a job, we will meet Bahar and review the song. 

874
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:06,600
Tell me that, look at me, are you excited? 

875
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:14,900
Mom, my heart will go out for two days or I hope my father is happy, but it is worth all this. 

876
01:50:15,740 --> 01:50:17,120
It will. 

877
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:20,360
I don't know, if you don't like it, or you might find it silly. 

878
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:27,580
Look, I know your father very well, dear, believe me, he will love our surprise. 

879
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:36,380
The message I was waiting for arrived, mom, I left, I kiss you, I am leaving, peanut. 

880
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:41,840
Now I was going to say eat the tomato. 

881
01:51:03,675 --> 01:51:05,835
Who are you texting with? 

882
01:51:06,625 --> 01:51:10,115
I will meet a friend for work and I communicate with him.

883
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:19,660
Is that? 

884
01:51:19,660 --> 01:51:20,660
Exactly. 

885
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:31,940
It doesn't seem like a scary place at all. 

886
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:34,500
If you want to decide without seeing the inside. 

887
01:51:35,355 --> 01:51:36,415
Then I won't go in. 

888
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:38,780
You enter. 

889
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:43,500
Forgiveness. 

890
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:57,340
I didn't tell the kids that you didn't come home at night. 

891
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:01,219
Who bothered him? 

892
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:05,660
What else could work? You will be two minutes late. I'm going. 

893
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:13,040
Okay, but I'm late so hungry I'll eat whatever comes to the table, let me know. 

894
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:39,880
Hello. 

895
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:41,080
Yes? 

896
01:52:42,540 --> 01:52:43,820
I stayed in the office last night. 

897
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:48,740
Stay home tonight, please. 

898
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:50,340
How are you? 

899
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:53,320
I say let me go today. 

900
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:55,840
Why can't we talk, Yasemin? 

901
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:57,560
Yes? 

902
01:52:57,700 --> 01:53:02,139
Not good, well say hi, say hi.

903
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:20,519
Murat go and see, Yasemin kills me hour after hour. 

904
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:34,240
I got there too early to get some work done, but when you got there early, plans fell into the water. 

905
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:42,519
What happens, my dear, you can enjoy it and I already have breakfast with my friend ... 

906
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:47,620
What happened? 

907
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:59,660
My father, Bahar my father, all the surprise will be ruined here, he has seen us now, are you okay? 

908
01:54:01,740 --> 01:54:02,340
My daughter. 

909
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:03,720
Dad. 

910
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:11,740
Girl, what are you doing here my dear? 

911
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:15,520
What are you doing? I was sitting with my friend. 

912
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:39,139
Hi, I'm Bahar. Then you are Derin's father. 

913
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:40,740
Yes, Murat, Bahar. 

914
01:54:42,740 --> 01:54:46,900
Girl I'm going to the meeting for coffee, do you need one? 

915
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:49,639
No dad, thanks, easy. 

916
01:54:50,355 --> 01:54:53,355
I'm glad again, maybe we'll see each other again. 

917
01:54:54,160 --> 01:54:58,320
Maybe, come on, see you. 

918
01:54:58,520 --> 01:54:59,520
See you.

919
01:55:15,660 --> 01:55:19,700
It was so bad, are you looking here right now? 

920
01:55:19,700 --> 01:55:21,800
Do not worry. 

921
01:55:22,515 --> 01:55:24,215
Come on, what did you want? 

922
01:55:25,315 --> 01:55:26,565
An American. 

923
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:31,140
I was so terrified, don't you think? 

924
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:38,460
Derin didn't understand, could you calm down? 

925
01:55:39,515 --> 01:55:40,515
OK. 

926
01:56:25,665 --> 01:56:28,335
When he's alone, definitely call, we need to talk. 

927
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:09,720
Ruhi, you know, if I ask Murat now, he will understand why I asked him, so I told you. 

928
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:14,880
Last year he did not like his cake, he does not say that I will not be sad .. 

929
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:22,280
Anyway, what happens, my Ruhi, you go in and out of your nose, you find out what kind of cake he wants. 

930
01:57:23,420 --> 01:57:28,600
Okay, okay, my dear Yasemin, calm down, don't worry about it. 

931
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:33,340
You're great, Ruhi, okay, let's help out a bit, let's go. 

932
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:35,340
Well. 

933
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:40,360
Mommy.

934
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:41,420
My dear. 

935
01:57:47,540 --> 01:57:48,620
What happened? 

936
01:57:48,980 --> 01:57:50,440
Are you mad at my dad? 

937
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:56,095
Baby why are you so fatherly? 

938
01:57:56,100 --> 01:58:00,900
He didn't kiss me when I went in the morning, he always kissed me and never forgot. 

939
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:10,320
Now your father was going to kiss you completely this morning, when your uncle Barlas came, your father told me ... 

940
01:58:10,420 --> 01:58:14,800
This morning, go and kiss me, I forgot. 

941
01:58:16,060 --> 01:58:17,580
It's OK now? 

942
01:58:18,180 --> 01:58:22,580
He also said something. He said if we had a barbecue in the evening. 

943
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:24,115
Get meatballs? 

944
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:28,300
Of course I'm my lamb, I'll do it to you right away. 

945
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:29,780
Hurrah! 

946
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:40,880
Without running, shirt, shirt. 

947
02:00:11,580 --> 02:00:15,220
I love that those who have a sterile life like you buy these motors. 

948
02:00:16,380 --> 02:00:17,380
I do not understand.

949
02:00:17,820 --> 02:00:24,040
So I say you will do a maximum of 90, a little too much. How many do you really do? 

950
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:26,160
300. 

951
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:31,680
Wow, it's good, if you give it your right. 

952
02:00:32,260 --> 02:00:34,020
How do you know it didn't come out of 300? 

953
02:00:36,765 --> 02:00:37,775
Of type. 

954
02:00:40,820 --> 02:00:43,200
If you want, I can show you how wrong you are. 

955
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:50,500
Why not? Show me 

956
02:00:52,640 --> 02:01:00,600
Are you married? I'm not married, anyway, I don't think I'm going to believe the pattern. 

957
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:02,500
But not me. 

958
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:14,960
My father. 

959
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:16,440
He is your father? 

960
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:24,120
What happened, are you scared? Let's get out of here before we meet. 

961
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:34,640
Come on fly with me. 

962
02:01:54,420 --> 02:01:58,760
A cake is important brother, everyone has a taste. 

963
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:03,440
I don't know, for example, I like chocolate, you. 

964
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:12,140
Didn't you get tired in this game? Leave me alone, brother, leave me alone.

965
02:02:13,240 --> 02:02:16,960
Okay, I want cherry, okay cherry. 

966
02:02:17,620 --> 02:02:24,140
Wait a minute, why is it a cake underneath now, doesn't it happen every year, Murat ...? 

967
02:02:24,140 --> 02:02:28,700
I'm asking, you're saying, I'm asking, you're saying So what happened now? 

968
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:32,080
So aren't you bored with this nonsense, Ruhi? 

969
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:35,540
We know why we come to the party for not knowing, isn't it always the same terane? 

970
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:41,600
What do you do or don't you do what you do? We lie to each other what surprises this .. 

971
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:48,500
We all know that we are not surprised, we know like ice, we lie, we ignore. 

972
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:49,560
But then .. 

973
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:57,960
What, Ruhi, is there a dead man there, we see the corpse lying there, but we ignore it, Ruhi, why? 

974
02:02:58,420 --> 02:03:02,580
Murat, brother, are you okay? 

975
02:03:02,580 --> 02:03:03,380
I'm good.

976
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:10,600
So what is this death, dead, so nothing from this birthday in this house? 

977
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:16,160
I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed, brother, I'm overwhelmed by this meaningless life ... 

978
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:23,059
Or it affects me, it collapses like a nightmare, I can't breathe. 

979
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:27,600
Wow, now I get it. 

980
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:34,720
It's normal, but boy, you went to the andrope but you say it? 

981
02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:38,960
I told you a lot, do you understand that? 

982
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:43,940
So what, don't spoil my son, don't spoil yourself! 

983
02:03:43,940 --> 02:03:47,519
Yasemin breaks to make you happy girl. 

984
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:49,940
Yasemin, are you tearing up for me? 

985
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:55,480
Let it be for the love of God, everything is doing by itself, what do you have to do? I have something to ask 

986
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:59,223
myself ... Look, there are cards in my hand, I have to choose one of those cards ... 

987
02:03:59,223 --> 02:04:02,960
What does it matter to me, what does it matter?

988
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:09,100
She does it herself, to show her friends how perfect she is. 

989
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:12,040
What does that have to do with me? I do not care? 

990
02:04:17,860 --> 02:04:21,299
I'm sorry, Ruhi, it's okay, I'm sorry. 

991
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:27,031
Tevfik Bey, let's clarify this detail tomorrow, okay, okay ... 

992
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:31,340
An important phone arrived, okay, I'll call you. 

993
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:38,940
Yes Ruhi, what did he say quickly? 

994
02:04:39,740 --> 02:04:40,980
He wanted cherry. 

995
02:04:42,140 --> 02:04:43,420
Cherry, are you sure? 

996
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:45,360
Yes because? 

997
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:49,480
Not at all, he doesn't normally like cherries. 

998
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:52,940
I don't know, so she started loving the cherry. This is what I understand. 

999
02:04:53,260 --> 02:04:57,440
Okay, okay, if you're that cool, Ruhi, you saved my life. 

1000
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:00,820
What are you going to do this year? Is your program ready? 

1001
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:06,080
This year I'm going to set off a strange bomb, but I wouldn't even tell you.

1002
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:10,040
Thanks. 

1003
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:21,559
Yasemin will ask you something, did you fight with Murat? 

1004
02:05:22,420 --> 02:05:23,600
Not because? 

1005
02:05:24,020 --> 02:05:31,140
It's not that important, I was a bit frustrated, so something happened at the company. 

1006
02:05:31,340 --> 02:05:34,340
I guess it's very stressful these days. 

1007
02:05:37,740 --> 02:05:40,019
Alright, see you later. 

1008
02:06:02,715 --> 02:06:03,915
Why don't you pick up the phone? 

1009
02:06:04,305 --> 02:06:05,565
I had some work. 

1010
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:07,580
OK, we need to talk. 

1011
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:12,400
I think we also need to talk, I'm downstairs. 

1012
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:19,140
Where is it down Okay, I see you, I see you, 

1013
02:06:19,680 --> 02:06:24,080
Wait, I'm not going, you don't need to come, I'm coming, wait, I'm coming. 

1014
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:32,200
Father. 

1015
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:36,460
Enters. 

1016
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:51,760
I thought I was a stranger and I was scared. 

1017
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:03,960
What happened? Did you start kidnapping? 

1018
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:07,520
My daughter, don't you understand the word? Didn't I tell you to move out?

1019
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:13,820
I do not understand, I am scarce, my head does not buy. What are you doing or are you crazy? 

1020
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:22,980
Now listen to me well, if I see you again about 50 meters from the company, I will not look at your tears. 

1021
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:31,720
Put it in that bird's brain, okay, girl, get out of my car and my life now! 

1022
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:38,500
Let. 

1023
02:07:56,380 --> 02:07:58,040
I can't see you, where are you? 

1024
02:07:58,040 --> 02:07:59,760
I'm close, wait, I'm coming. 

1025
02:08:00,420 --> 02:08:02,420
No, you are not coming, I am going. 

1026
02:08:18,620 --> 02:08:21,640
You were right in front of the company, what are you doing here? 

1027
02:08:22,900 --> 02:08:24,420
You asked me. 

1028
02:08:27,115 --> 02:08:28,514
Can I have my watch? 

1029
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:37,900
Well. Turns out it was a gift from your wife, let's see. 

1030
02:08:46,660 --> 02:08:51,200
Where do you meet Derin, Bahar, what did you talk to? 

1031
02:08:51,740 --> 02:08:55,760
I am being interrogated, it is not an important thing, it is air to water.

1032
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:09,480
We will not meet, we will not meet again, this is not true Bahar, the latter is each other .. 

1033
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:12,160
May this be the end, we will not see each other again. 

1034
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:13,220
Why is that? 

1035
02:09:13,220 --> 02:09:15,220
Because I am married. 

1036
02:09:17,980 --> 02:09:23,299
We already understood that, am I not aware that friendship is forbidden in married people? 

1037
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:24,940
We are not friends? 

1038
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:43,140
It would be wrong, this is wrong for you and me, okay, this is the last time, could you make it easier? 

1039
02:09:45,680 --> 02:09:47,980
Please im sorry. 

1040
02:09:50,940 --> 02:10:03,540
You say it's over, okay, Murat, we haven't started yet. 

1041
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:12,180
Please let's go. 

1042
02:10:33,220 --> 02:10:37,320
Well then, goodbye then. 

1043
02:10:57,940 --> 02:11:06,900
Stop, Murat Efendi, I haven't started yet, we haven't started yet. 

1044
02:11:15,860 --> 02:11:19,219
Hello sir, my dear Derin, say it dear. 

1045
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:27,059
Okay, I'm coming.

1046
02:11:36,080 --> 02:11:41,815
Sema, look at me Sema, take care of your daughter. 

1047
02:11:41,820 --> 02:11:43,620
I swear ... 

1048
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:49,440
Fulfill our agreement, shut up, or complete the unfinished business? 

1049
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:54,440
Don't bother, how did you find me? 

1050
02:11:55,020 --> 02:12:02,940
Say hello to that little demon like you're putting it with my hand! There is no escape from me. Be smart Sema be smart. 

1051
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:36,000
Murat, I can't tell you how excited, if you saw a birthday, like a child all day ... 

1052
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:40,720
She asks me all kinds of questions about surprise ... 

1053
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:49,000
But if I screw it up, I don't open my mouth, of course, a sweet excitement surrounded us all ... 

1054
02:12:51,020 --> 02:12:56,860
If you could come, dad, maybe we will get permission. 

1055
02:13:01,180 --> 02:13:11,200
Anyway, I'll tell you for a long time. It is very difficult for you to know the details.

1056
02:13:12,160 --> 02:13:20,700
I agree with the company Sitare works for. 

1057
02:13:20,700 --> 02:13:32,660
Murat wanted cherry too, you know dad yeah I know I don't normally like it. 

1058
02:13:32,660 --> 02:13:41,519
But I don't understand, maybe it will change but I didn't say the real bomb ... 

1059
02:13:41,940 --> 02:13:49,599
I won't tell you, will you miss it? 

1060
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:50,600
Yasemin. 

1061
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:52,639
Yes Dad. 

1062
02:13:54,260 --> 02:13:55,520
When is my birthday? 

1063
02:13:56,700 --> 02:13:59,080
5th of April. 

1064
02:14:01,020 --> 02:14:02,540
I couldn't suddenly remember. 

1065
02:14:06,780 --> 02:14:11,059
Dear Dad. 

1066
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:24,360
Daddy, I'm coming. 

1067
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:35,820
I didn't know you were coming. 

1068
02:14:36,160 --> 02:14:42,059
I decided so suddenly, Yasemin, that I told you to look at you and let me see your father for a long time. 

1069
02:14:42,180 --> 02:14:49,720
You did well, I called you that you were busy today, is everything okay at work? 

1070
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:53,260
Account, as always, how is your father? 

1071
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:54,520
Well. 

1072
02:15:06,640 --> 02:15:07,840
Come come ..

1073
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:41,040
Bahar, my daughter, you must come here immediately. 

1074
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:49,780
What happened to Semoş? Isn't it Veysel meat again? 

1075
02:15:49,780 --> 02:15:54,620
No, it's not about him, we can't talk on the phone. 

1076
02:15:55,140 --> 02:15:56,140
Well. 

1077
02:16:21,980 --> 02:16:26,419
Ediz Bey's medication time has come, I'll give him his meds and deposit it. 

1078
02:16:26,420 --> 02:16:29,940
Okay, we were getting up, my father is entrusted to you. 

1079
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:31,380
Don't worry, Mrs. Yasemin. 

1080
02:16:32,180 --> 02:16:38,160
My daddy dear, we're leaving now, rest well, take your medicine, it's okay, dear. 

1081
02:16:39,138 --> 02:16:40,759
Lets go dad. 

1082
02:16:46,040 --> 02:16:49,020
I'll come again, okay, dad? 

1083
02:16:55,959 --> 02:17:09,359
Ediz Bey, we have to go take your meds, come on. 

1084
02:17:23,558 --> 02:17:24,558
Let. 

1085
02:17:27,058 --> 02:17:33,919
What happened now, sorry about last night, sorry, what can I do?

1086
02:17:34,180 --> 02:17:39,180
When you apologize, it doesn't end, they both apologize and push me behind me. 

1087
02:17:39,440 --> 02:17:46,620
About what I'm throwing, I said what I feel, what should I say more. 

1088
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:49,660
Are you sad, are you really sad? 

1089
02:17:49,660 --> 02:17:50,660
Yes. 

1090
02:17:50,860 --> 02:17:53,080
I don't think you are even aware of what you are doing. 

1091
02:17:53,080 --> 02:17:55,080
Speak clearly what you want to say. 

1092
02:18:02,540 --> 02:18:06,900
I promised Ece, your father will come at night, I said we will have a barbecue. 

1093
02:18:07,459 --> 02:18:09,299
Well, we do, we do. 

1094
02:18:34,135 --> 02:18:37,424
Semos girl scared me as the fuss manager, what's going on again? 

1095
02:18:37,424 --> 02:18:49,519
You walk in, you walk in quick, what are you doing in your head, huh? 

1096
02:18:49,860 --> 02:18:53,400
Why am I getting confused? Tell me and I'll find out. 

1097
02:18:53,600 --> 02:18:56,480
Look at me, I know you're going to Barlas, Bahar. 

1098
02:18:57,480 --> 02:19:03,520
The point is that, no where did you know I went?

1099
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:07,900
This problem does not lift the water, do not mess with Barlas, he is a very bad guy. 

1100
02:19:07,900 --> 02:19:16,660
Look at Semoş, girl, are you watching this? Why did not you tell me. 

1101
02:19:16,740 --> 02:19:21,799
Let Satan see his face, what will I meet him? How beautiful I had lost my mark. 

1102
02:19:21,799 --> 02:19:27,138
But thanks to you, they chased him again, look at me, look at my neck. 

1103
02:19:27,138 --> 02:19:30,958
Warned, never mind Barlas .. 

1104
02:19:31,500 --> 02:19:44,379
Wherever he has a hand, he pushes us all, and if there is anything left of us. 

1105
02:19:48,860 --> 02:19:56,040
Wow wow, who came, hello, not welcome girl? 

1106
02:19:56,100 --> 02:19:57,520
Welcome. 

1107
02:20:00,655 --> 02:20:03,505
Welcome my lion, are you tired? 

1108
02:20:07,860 --> 02:20:11,740
Where Bahar? Stay for lunch, we'll break the back of two words. 

1109
02:20:12,780 --> 02:20:13,920
I have a job, Brother Veysel.

1110
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:22,000
Eat my work, look at me, does this moment tell me something behind my back? The language of husband and wife does not stop. 

1111
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:25,234
Look girl, are you saying something bad behind me? 

1112
02:20:25,240 --> 02:20:32,640
No, Veysel, is that so? Bahar, of course, my daughter, we haven't been doing anything together for dinner. 

1113
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:36,480
Come on, set the table, Sema, and don't machine the girl. 

1114
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:38,939
Sit down let's go. 

1115
02:21:03,620 --> 02:21:07,180
Not alone for a minute. 

1116
02:21:10,080 --> 02:21:13,940
When I run, it flies really fast, right dad? 

1117
02:21:13,980 --> 02:21:16,119
Yes girl, well done, well done to you. 

1118
02:21:16,660 --> 02:21:22,520
Well done, didn't I say Ece, won't you play with this? 

1119
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:23,380
But mother. 

1120
02:21:23,380 --> 02:21:25,439
Why aren't you listening? 

1121
02:21:33,740 --> 02:21:34,740
But mom. 

1122
02:21:35,720 --> 02:21:38,679
Mrs. Filiz, Mrs. Filiz. 

1123
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,180
But I didn't do anything wrong. 

1124
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:48,820
You didn't, you didn't, I know, my dear.

1125
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:54,300
If it's up to you anyway, good time, Filiz. 

1126
02:21:57,880 --> 02:22:01,000
Can I ask Ece why he's not looking, Mrs. Filiz? 

1127
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:04,395
Excuse me, ma'am, I just wanted some air. 

1128
02:22:04,400 --> 02:22:08,440
I will never argue about this with you, blood sweat boy ... 

1129
02:22:09,180 --> 02:22:11,100
Whatever happens, take it and change it. 

1130
02:22:11,740 --> 02:22:12,740
But mom. 

1131
02:22:16,020 --> 02:22:21,660
You destroy it, it has opened up enough trouble for us. 

1132
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:45,060
Let me help my mother. 

1133
02:22:45,060 --> 02:22:49,740
It is not necessary, sit down. You have reached the beginning of forty years. 

1134
02:22:54,580 --> 02:23:09,000
As much as you forgive in the kitchen. Tell me what are you doing, do you sing songs in the pavilion? 

1135
02:23:10,720 --> 02:23:12,580
I'm not working on the ward. 

1136
02:23:12,780 --> 02:23:20,160
Of course, the pavilion, the cafeteria, of course it is not them, but your voice is also burned. 

1137
02:23:20,780 --> 02:23:22,760
Take your hand, put your hand on your arm.

1138
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:24,539
What would you do if I am not? 

1139
02:23:26,120 --> 02:23:28,060
Pray, I would know what to do if my mother is not there. 

1140
02:23:28,260 --> 02:23:32,060
What the hell are you doing, are you holding my head? 

1141
02:23:32,060 --> 02:23:36,300
What do you think you are I gave you your bread, thank you ungrateful. 

1142
02:23:38,060 --> 02:23:47,619
Veysel, don't be a victim, I apologize for what you did, please. 

1143
02:23:53,200 --> 02:24:02,140
I'm running away, Semos, you're happy with your husband. 

1144
02:24:05,580 --> 02:24:06,680
Leave my hand. 

1145
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:24,360
Bahar, my daughter, I will tell you not to go, but every time we arrive, our peace fades. 

1146
02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:30,840
Semoş, the guy tried to touch me. 

1147
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:37,100
No, it's not, you like her daughter, when drunk, is a bit silly, but in essence ... 

1148
02:24:37,140 --> 02:24:45,760
In essence, it is good in its essence, look what I say, hang out or hang ... 

1149
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:53,380
. ..watch your wave, eat these rhythms, sit down, choose this life ...

1150
02:24:53,380 --> 02:25:01,820
You choose to live this unpleasant life, so you deserve all the beatings you've eaten ... 

1151
02:25:01,820 --> 02:25:05,480
But I can't bear this unpleasant life, I don't have to live with you. 

1152
02:25:05,480 --> 02:25:09,920
Happiness for you in this life is miserable. 

1153
02:25:10,885 --> 02:25:13,635
Bahar, Barlas is a matter of ... 

1154
02:25:13,780 --> 02:25:21,380
Don't ever call me Barlas again, you know that guy will pay me the penalty for what he did. 

1155
02:25:21,400 --> 02:25:29,980
I'll pay one for one, I won't stop until your happy little family falls apart and the flour is small. 

1156
02:25:31,220 --> 02:25:39,199
You can't help it, I'll take revenge, you can't help it when you're done. 

1157
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:48,320
It will be so regrettable if you have an idea, don't tell me Barlas again ... 

1158
02:25:48,780 --> 02:25:53,260
Don't try to intervene, I don't look at your tears. 

1159
02:26:01,620 --> 02:26:03,640
Sema, come on. 

1160
02:26:18,100 --> 02:26:19,100
What happened? 

1161
02:26:20,700 --> 02:26:22,240
Fortunately, he did not have a fever.

1162
02:26:24,300 --> 02:26:28,599
You got it all in vain again, boy, what is it? 

1163
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:31,880
Let's not talk here, come. 

1164
02:26:45,480 --> 02:26:55,000
I know Murat, it's a boy, but Ece is sick, what you don't understand is that. 

1165
02:26:56,200 --> 02:27:03,680
Well, this is not a matter of understanding, I also know that our daughter is ill. 

1166
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:07,360
But I'm trying to keep experiencing this, Yasemin ... 

1167
02:27:07,360 --> 02:27:12,500
... you never let us forget this, you don't. 

1168
02:27:12,600 --> 02:27:19,740
I don't forget because the day you had that accident, listening to you, trusting you ... 

1169
02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:23,420
I can't forgive myself for getting in your car ... 

1170
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:28,860
I can't forgive myself for letting my daughter do this. 

1171
02:27:28,980 --> 02:27:35,760
It was an accident Yasemin, you know it was an accident or did you see the man come and hit me, I did nothing. 

1172
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:40,300
You drank Murat, you drank.

1173
02:27:43,580 --> 02:28:05,800
Again, how many times are we going to discuss this? I had a glass, this accident is not my fault. 

1174
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:13,720
Yasemin, it's not my fault that the car came and hit me, Ece was born prematurely. 

1175
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:22,179
It's not my fault that her heart was born sick, we had an accident, that's all ... 

1176
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:37,900
Ece is not only your daughter, but also my daughter. 

1177
02:29:03,980 --> 02:29:04,840
Dad. 

1178
02:29:04,840 --> 02:29:05,840
My daughter. 

1179
02:29:05,960 --> 02:29:07,720
Are you going somewhere? 

1180
02:29:13,980 --> 02:29:20,320
No girl, I forgot my phone in the car, I thought it was here. 

1181
02:29:21,220 --> 02:29:22,900
Well, I'm in my room. 

1182
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:28,960
My beautiful daughter, my dear daughter. 

1183
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:39,120
Look, if you want. 

1184
02:33:40,600 --> 02:33:47,100
No need to wait a bit, I wonder, right? If you can't find it, my value goes up. 

1185
02:33:48,680 --> 02:33:52,740
I have been married for 20 years, of course I forgot these games.

1186
02:33:57,600 --> 02:34:00,900
So 20, congratulations, it's not easy. 

1187
02:34:01,960 --> 02:34:03,599
Thanks . 

1188
02:34:05,080 --> 02:34:07,340
You were telling the scene. 

1189
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:12,860
Now our garden is big enough that there is no problem with setting up a scene. 

1190
02:34:13,820 --> 02:34:19,580
Actually, I thought it would be better to see the Yasemin Hanım place, so how much acoustics or something like that ... 

1191
02:34:19,580 --> 02:34:24,660
Where to put a column, how to choose a microphone, these are important details. 

1192
02:34:24,660 --> 02:34:30,840
Of course it would be, but I didn't know how to do it because Murat surprised me. 

1193
02:34:30,840 --> 02:34:36,060
If he sees you home now, his surprise will disappear. 

1194
02:34:36,200 --> 02:34:38,980
Of course, you are telling the truth, let's not break the surprise. 

1195
02:34:39,180 --> 02:34:44,060
Let me meet up and ask where it is. 

1196
02:35:06,100 --> 02:35:12,200
I think you're right, I guess the chase got away.

1197
02:35:12,940 --> 02:35:17,580
Certainly your spouse must have been after you as well. 

1198
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:24,220
Murat is not really that kind of man, come on. 

1199
02:35:25,960 --> 02:35:31,859
I can swear that men come out of a single pattern, frankly, I think they are all the same. 

1200
02:35:31,860 --> 02:35:35,060
We have a different relationship with dynamics. 

1201
02:35:35,360 --> 02:35:46,720
I understand, your husband is very lucky, Mrs. Yasemin, he obviously knew what he wanted, he ran after him. 

1202
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:36,480
I say let's put it on the open buffet, the tables will be in the middle. 

1203
02:36:39,860 --> 02:36:41,840
We will set the scene here. 

1204
02:36:45,860 --> 02:36:46,860
Could be. 

1205
02:36:48,080 --> 02:36:50,880
We will make a place for children here. 

1206
02:37:08,540 --> 02:37:14,800
Everything is fine but I need 1-2 more hours Ruhi, yeah what's up a little more distraction. 

1207
02:37:16,120 --> 02:37:19,400
Okay see you all. 

1208
02:37:20,260 --> 02:37:24,480
I arrived just in time Bahar, but now we have to hide you ...

1209
02:37:24,480 --> 02:37:27,400
Because you are the surprise of the night. 

1210
02:37:38,585 --> 02:37:41,464
Wherever you look, we are here for 2 more hours. 

1211
02:37:41,825 --> 02:37:44,845
This will be a two hour zoom, how do we take it, with the saddlebag? 

1212
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:54,840
Guys, something came to my mind. 

1213
02:37:54,840 --> 02:38:04,260
I'm not going to this birthday, look good idea, be really surprised. 

1214
02:38:04,260 --> 02:38:06,680
What are you saying? Yasemin kills me. 

1215
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:12,222
No, forget it, Sitare divides me into fourteen, you lost one out of two. 

1216
02:38:12,222 --> 02:38:14,300
Either he will go or he will go. 

1217
02:38:14,440 --> 02:38:15,500
Exactly. 

1218
02:38:17,960 --> 02:38:21,339
Friends or is this woman crazy? 

1219
02:38:21,360 --> 02:38:21,860
Why. 

1220
02:38:21,860 --> 02:38:24,620
Or do you think he wants me crazy? 

1221
02:38:25,860 --> 02:38:33,300
If you quit smoking, you drank enough, you'll drink where we go, let's spend that night. 

1222
02:38:33,780 --> 02:38:38,540
Today is my birthday, the relationship will give me a drink. 

1223
02:38:38,540 --> 02:38:40,540
I forget that everything is really a surprise.

1224
02:38:41,020 --> 02:38:44,620
My soul has shrunk my soul, brother, I'll be wandering. 

1225
02:38:44,620 --> 02:38:48,060
Let me tell you a coffee, that birthday boy. 

1226
02:38:50,460 --> 02:38:51,759
Two things put something into it. 

1227
02:38:52,500 --> 02:38:58,660
Of course, would you throw this away? Even if you make a black coffee, even double. 

1228
02:39:00,480 --> 02:39:05,980
I know you won't open it, but today is my birthday, I wanted you to know. 

1229
02:39:13,060 --> 02:39:15,400
You can easily prepare here. 

1230
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:17,280
Thank you Mrs. Yasemin. 

1231
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:21,020
If you need anything, just let me know. 

1232
02:39:21,020 --> 02:39:28,500
Sure, can I order a juice if Ms. Yasemin doesn't mind? 

1233
02:39:28,940 --> 02:39:30,160
Sure sure. 

1234
02:39:30,160 --> 02:39:31,560
I would be very happy if they have cherry. 

1235
02:39:32,220 --> 02:39:33,840
Fine, I'm shipping right away. 

1236
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:34,840
Thanks. 

1237
02:40:08,200 --> 02:40:09,200
I got to the room. 

1238
02:40:16,120 --> 02:40:17,780
Let us begin. 

1239
02:40:26,400 --> 02:40:29,600
Derin, are you okay?

1240
02:40:30,300 --> 02:40:35,619
Onur, I'm a little excited, I don't think I can breathe a little. 

1241
02:40:35,620 --> 02:40:48,660
Okay, calm down, take a deep breath, take it now, let it go slowly, well, calm down, okay? 

1242
02:40:49,120 --> 02:40:52,460
Okay, okay, I'll be fine, I'll be fine. 

1243
02:40:56,640 --> 02:41:02,400
You didn't go to the doctor for your hand, we talked a lot. Why are you doing this? 

1244
02:41:02,400 --> 02:41:10,140
Onur was cured, cured, but now he's completely stunned, I can't touch, I'll be in disgrace, what do I do? 

1245
02:41:10,500 --> 02:41:17,500
Okay okay, calm down, you're going to play it wonderfully. 

1246
02:42:01,180 --> 02:42:02,520
It was very nice. 

1247
02:42:09,320 --> 02:42:19,699
Sorry, look, forgive. Excuse me? 

1248
02:42:20,460 --> 02:42:20,960
Here you are. 

1249
02:42:20,960 --> 02:42:25,160
Could you call me Mrs. Yasemin, very urgent but really urgent? 

1250
02:42:25,160 --> 02:42:26,160
Of course. 

1251
02:42:44,460 --> 02:42:50,919
We are broke, Mrs. Yasemin. What are we going to do now? No, I didn't bring any other clothes like me.

1252
02:42:51,360 --> 02:42:55,320
Okay, don't be mad, we'll have something for me in my clothes. 

1253
02:42:55,320 --> 02:43:01,520
Really, I was afraid that I will not be able to go on stage, the surprise will be broken. 

1254
02:43:01,520 --> 02:43:05,020
Nothing, let's find something. 

1255
02:43:08,200 --> 02:43:09,540
Yes. 

1256
02:43:35,720 --> 02:43:39,800
This is a very nice dress, can I wear it? 

1257
02:43:40,800 --> 02:43:45,679
I mean, of course, but this is a very old dress. 

1258
02:43:46,060 --> 02:43:49,720
What matters, you know, retro things like that are all the rage right now. 

1259
02:43:50,220 --> 02:43:52,279
Well, take it then. 

1260
02:43:55,340 --> 02:44:01,180
You are so lovely Ms. Yasemin, a wonderful piece. 

1261
02:44:19,340 --> 02:44:20,380
What kind of car is this? 

1262
02:44:24,060 --> 02:44:25,060
Come. 

1263
02:44:25,440 --> 02:44:30,740
I swear my foot is kicking back, am I obligated to join this party? 

1264
02:44:30,740 --> 02:44:33,619
Don't be silly, son, we've already arrived. 

1265
02:44:33,620 --> 02:44:37,940
I don't want to go in and do something wrong again, I swear I'm going.

1266
02:44:37,940 --> 02:44:44,000
Ağa is enough. We have been a babysitter for you since morning, come back to yourself, what is this? 

1267
02:44:44,220 --> 02:44:50,859
What do you say, my son? You don't feel sorry for us. 

1268
02:44:50,860 --> 02:44:51,900
Wrench. 

1269
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:54,540
Open the door. 

1270
02:44:54,540 --> 02:44:56,000
What were these? 

1271
02:44:56,760 --> 02:45:02,060
Stop it, calm down. 

1272
02:45:06,820 --> 02:45:08,960
I'm not going to do anything, my birthday is mine today. 

1273
02:45:09,280 --> 02:45:11,280
Welcome Murat. 

1274
02:45:11,520 --> 02:45:13,300
Thanks. 

1275
02:45:14,700 --> 02:45:16,580
Good night. 

1276
02:45:16,580 --> 02:45:18,280
Thanks. 

1277
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:25,380
Good night. 

1278
02:45:25,380 --> 02:45:25,880
Welcome. 

1279
02:45:25,880 --> 02:45:27,579
Good night. 

1280
02:45:30,185 --> 02:45:30,680
Thanks. Hello. 

1281
02:45:30,680 --> 02:45:32,020
Welcome. 

1282
02:45:32,020 --> 02:45:40,140
What nonsense is this Sitare, hello, how are you? 

1283
02:45:40,480 --> 02:45:44,680
Hello welcome. 

1284
02:45:44,680 --> 02:45:47,040
Hello welcome. 

1285
02:45:49,895 --> 02:45:52,575
I'm waiting at the company, okay? 

1286
02:46:03,145 --> 02:46:04,560
Yasemin, thank you honey. 

1287
02:46:04,560 --> 02:46:05,560
Murat. 

1288
02:46:39,785 --> 02:46:41,615
Happy birthday, Mr. Murat.

1289
02:47:01,100 --> 02:47:14,400
Divine Murat Bey, you must be the husband of Mrs. Yasemin, we actually met, more precisely, we were deeply caught. 

1290
02:47:17,080 --> 02:47:23,820
When Yasemin said, it was as if she understood. 

1291
02:47:23,820 --> 02:47:27,940
I almost caused the marriage to end in my awkwardness. 

1292
02:47:32,460 --> 02:47:34,480
Yasemin, I thought you were. 

1293
02:47:35,020 --> 02:47:36,120
I gave him my dress. 

1294
02:47:36,660 --> 02:47:37,660
Of the. 

1295
02:47:38,700 --> 02:47:40,700
Happy birthday, by the way. 

1296
02:47:45,880 --> 02:47:57,300
Good evening everyone, welcome back. My dear husband Murat 20 years ago. 

1297
02:47:58,100 --> 02:48:11,600
She wrote me a poem to tell her love, she was pregnant with my daughter, now our daughter has grown up. 

1298
02:48:11,800 --> 02:48:17,060
And his poetry compositions written by his father, Derin ... 

1299
02:48:29,960 --> 02:48:40,939
... but don't worry, I won't read. Someone who can do this job much better than me right now ...

1300
02:48:40,940 --> 02:48:51,260
Bahar is my gift to Murat. Bahar will tell us about love tonight and say ... 

1301
02:48:54,360 --> 02:49:03,320
... love, Murat is for you, happy birthday darling. 

1302
02:50:37,500 --> 02:50:40,480
I said you would love my surprise. 

1303
02:50:40,980 --> 02:50:46,220
Yasemin, I have to tell you something. 

1304
02:50:47,200 --> 02:50:48,420
I'm listening. 

1305
02:50:49,260 --> 02:50:53,180
I'll tell you everything clearly, Yasemin.
