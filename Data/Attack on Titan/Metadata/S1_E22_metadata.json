As the Scout Regiment tries to recover from the brutal losses of the operation, emotions run high.", "Levi orders Mikasa to distract the Female Titan in order to get Eren back. Levi launches a successful high-speed attack that debilitates the Female Titan, but Mikasa leaves herself vulnerable when she tries to finish the Female Titan. She's saved by Levi, who injures his leg in the process. They retreat with Eren, leaving the Female Titan badly wounded and slumped against a tree. As the Corps mourn, count their dead, and retrieve the bodies before returning home, Erwin orders that the fallen whose bodies were not retrieved be reported MIA. However, a Corps member, Dieter, against direct orders from Erwin, retrieves his dead friend Ivan's body, which draws the attention of two Titans to the retreating Corps. Mikasa kills one of the Titans to save Dieter, who loses both Ivan's body and another friend to a Titan. In order to outrun the remaining Titan, Levi reluctantly orders some of the bodies to be disposed in order to lighten the wagon's load, including Petra's body. Later, Eren wakes up from a dream of his past to find himself and the Corps back at town, safely behind the wall. He becomes angry upon hearing the townspeople berate the Corps' ineptitude, until he sees a boy who admires their bravery, which sends him into tears. All the while, a shocked Levi is questioned by Petra's father over his daughter's whereabouts, who reveals that Petra planned on devoting her life to Levi. The townspeople also become enraged and upset at Erwin over the failure of the mission and the casualties that were sustained. As a result of the failed expedition, Erwin and his subordinates are summoned to the capital, where it will be decided that Eren will be handed over.\u2014anonymous"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3158344", "rating": 9.0, "votes": 24611, "number_of_episodes": 98}
