Meanwhile, Eren is able to plug the hole in the wall thanks to the help of his fellow cadets, but the cost of humanity's first victory against the Titans will be vast.", "Jean manages to get another Maneuver Gear from a dead soldier and escape thanks to Annie, Connie, and Marco distracting the Titans. With Titan Eren now carrying the boulder towards the gate, Ian orders everyone to distract the Titans away from Eren, with some of them sacrificing their lives. Eren finally blocks the open gate with the boulder, and Rico fires a yellow flare to signal that the operation is a success. As Armin tries to pull out Eren from his Titan body, they are surrounded by two Titans but then saved by the timely arrival of Levi. With the gate finally sealed, the army eliminates all of the Titans in Trost except two which are captured for research purposes. As the army counts the casualties and dead, a shocked Jean finds Marco's dead eaten body, Sasha's group is horrified to find a pile of corpses regurgitated from a Titan, and Annie mourns one of her dead comrades. Meanwhile, Eren is locked up in a cell guarded by the Military Police where he is visited by Levi and Commander Erwin of the Recon Corps. After listening to his story and reasons for wanting the Titans dead, Levi allows Eren to join the Recon Corps under his command but warns if he ever betrays or goes berserk, he will personally kill him.\u2014forzazzz"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3034014", "rating": 8.9, "votes": 24792, "number_of_episodes": 98}
