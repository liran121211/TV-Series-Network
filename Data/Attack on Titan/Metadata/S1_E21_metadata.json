Armin theorizes the mole is someone who had seen Eren transform during the invasion of Trost. Eren wants to transform into his Titan form, but the squad tells him to trust in their skills and keep moving forward. Petra, Erd, and Auruo manage to blind the Female Titan and attempt to cut off her arms and kill her. However, the Female Titan manages to quickly regenerate her right eye and kills Erd, Petra, and Auruo. Seeing his comrades dead, a grieving Eren transforms into his Titan form which gets Mikasa and Levi's attention. Believing his comrades and squad's death could have been avoided if he had transformed in the first place, Eren fights the Female Titan in a long battle. The Female Titan defeats Eren by taking off his head and swallowing Eren. Mikasa attempts to stop the Female Titan but to no avail. She is later joined by Levi who tells her to keep their distance, as the Female Titan is getting tired.\u2014anonymous"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3148020", "rating": 9.6, "votes": 30650, "number_of_episodes": 98}
