Those that do make it to safety find a harsh life waiting for them, however.", "Hannes apologizes to Eren for not saving his mother; he admits he was afraid of the Titan and that both Eren and Mikasa are still weak children. Some of the Shiganshina townsfolk escape to the inner Wall Maria while the soldiers try to hold off the Titans. The soldiers try to close the gate, but one of the Titans (later named Armored Titan) rams the gate, breaching Wall Maria, and causing those inside to retreat even further to Wall Rose. Some time later, Eren has a strange dream in which his grieving father forcefully gives him an injection and his key before being woken up by Mikasa. Eren grows disgusted with the people of Wall Ros\u00e9 as the latter do not like sharing their food with the refugees. During the next year, as a food shortage becomes apparent, the government orders the refugees to work at the farms or fight to reclaim Wall Maria."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2844574", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 29697, "number_of_episodes": 98}
