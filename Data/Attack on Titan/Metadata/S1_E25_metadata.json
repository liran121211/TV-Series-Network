As the number of casualties multiplies and Annie tries to escape over the wall, Erwin must deal with the consequences of his plan.", "Eren and Annie fight each other as Titans throughout Stohess, causing destruction and civilian deaths while Hange orders her men to stand by before they capture Annie. Meanwhile, Erwin tells Nile he will accept responsibility for the damage his plan has caused, for which Nile has Erwin arrested while the Military Police help evacuate the civilians. After exchanging several blows, a berserk Eren completely overpowers Annie who attempts to escape by climbing up Wall Sina. However, Mikasa cuts off Annie's Titan fingers, sending her falling. As Annie falls, she remembers her father asking for forgiveness, telling her to hate the world and ask her to promise him she will come back home. When it appears Eren is about to eat Annie, he stops once he sees her crying, and her body starts encasing itself in crystal. As Eren recuperates, he admits to Mikasa, Jean, and Armin that he allowed Annie to get herself encased. As Jean and Armin wonder if sacrificing their humanity to defeat the Titans is worth the price, Erwin attends a government inquiry. Erwin reveals he kept his plans secret to prevent leaks. He further explains that despite the deaths and casualties of his plan and how they cannot get any information from Annie now that she is encased, she is proof there are humans that can turn into Titans living within the walls and he plans to find and use them to launch a counterattack against the Titans.\u2014anonymous"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3174248", "rating": 9.4, "votes": 28179, "number_of_episodes": 98}
