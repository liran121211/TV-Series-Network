Commander Pyxis!

Titans have been spotted, sir!

26
00:02:19,268 --> 00:02:22,729
We think Wall Rose
has been breached!

27
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:34,261
Great. Somebody explain
to me what this means.

28
00:02:35,845 --> 00:02:39,813
I don't know.
But they're Titans, right?

29
00:02:39,902 --> 00:02:42,340
Would they break a wall
with Titans in it?

30
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:44,191
Wouldn't be the first time.

31
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,887
It's how they
got into Shiganshina.

32
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:49,022
That was a gate.

Armin. What exactly

Fall in!

35
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:55,558
The walls are different.

36
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:57,324
There are no signs
of stress, no cracks,

37
00:02:57,384 --> 00:03:00,027
no crevices between the rocks.

38
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:03,470
We can't even really tell
how they were constructed.

39
00:03:05,327 --> 00:03:07,119
Suppose they're built
with the same stuff

40
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:08,942
Annie's trapped herself in?

41
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:12,946
Must be versatile material,

42
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:16,483
and we know it's virtually
indestructible.

43
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:21,569
So the walls are made of Titans?

Section Commander!
Why are you taking so long?

00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:26,993
Please! They're leaving in five
minutes with or without us!

46
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:28,228
You've got to wrap it up!

47
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:31,498
Hold your horses,
I just need another moment.

48
00:03:34,503 --> 00:03:37,032
Hange. Get moving.

49
00:03:37,104 --> 00:03:39,696
Uh, right!
Sorry! And our guest?

50
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:42,242
He's been ready
to go for a while.

51
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:54,563
Eren, you'll
get cold. Wear it tight.

52
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:56,735
Sorry to keep you waiting.

53
00:03:56,892 --> 00:03:59,462
Took longer to prepare
than I thought.

54
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:09,570
He's, uh. He's a priest
from the Order of the Walls.

55
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:12,739
I know! Ol' Nick and me
are thick as thieves!

56
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,178
It's fine. Makes about
as much sense for him

57
00:04:18,243 --> 00:04:20,325
to be here as the rest
of us, don't'cha think?

58
00:04:20,454 --> 00:04:22,482
We're random.

59
00:04:22,657 --> 00:04:25,016
No, on the contrary.

60
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:28,222
Erwin's thrown us
together for a reason.

61
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,177
Open the gate!

62
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:41,383
The status
of Wall Rose in unclear,

63
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:43,870
but everything
up to Ehrmich is safe.

64
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:46,073
That's the route
we'll be taking.

65
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,474
Let's move out!

66
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:49,776
Yes, sir!

67
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:51,178
You heard 'im.

68
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,883
Sir!

69
00:05:07,062 --> 00:05:09,429
This whole time,
Titans have been

70
00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:13,133
protecting us from other Titans.

71
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:25,690
Wait, wait! Back up!

72
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,955
You're joking, right?

73
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,947
This guy knew?
He knew and he kept quiet?

74
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,486
Uh-huh. Afraid so.

75
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:35,674
Just about sums up
where we are with him.

76
00:05:37,426 --> 00:05:39,838
Cat's out of
the bag now, of course.

77
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,195
He's not willing to talk yet,

78
00:05:42,393 --> 00:05:46,190
but we'll see how he feels
after a harsh dose of reality.

79
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:48,049
Faith keeps him quiet.

80
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,822
Firsthand experience, though?

81
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:52,494
To hell with that!

82
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:54,172
No! We're doing this backwards!

83
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,820
If this son of bitch
knows something

84
00:05:55,924 --> 00:05:57,463
he needs to come out with it!

85
00:05:57,613 --> 00:05:59,479
Humanity's on
the brink of extinction

86
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,080
and all you care about
is keeping your oath?

87
00:06:02,184 --> 00:06:04,580
Hey. Take it easy.

88
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:07,096
You're still not
fully recovered.

89
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:11,191
There's more than
one way to get at the truth.

90
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:14,227
Granted I may not be
in top form at the moment,

91
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:17,464
but it doesn't take much
strength to squeeze a trigger.

92
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,549
That said. I'm genuinely
hoping I won't have to

93
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:22,713
blow a hole in you
to settle this.

94
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:24,065
How about you?

95
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:26,190
Threatening him
doesn't work, Levi.

96
00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:28,208
Trust me on that.

97
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,322
Agree with him or not,
there's no denying

98
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:33,113
our priest here
is a man of principle.

99
00:06:33,307 --> 00:06:35,849
Which of course
leads me to wonder:

100
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:39,486
if he's so unwilling to talk,
what in heaven's name

101
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:43,490
do you imagine he's putting
above the fate of humanity?

102
00:06:45,694 --> 00:06:47,739
Up ahead, you see?
That's the village!

103
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:49,314
Where you're from?

104
00:06:49,338 --> 00:06:53,901
No, but it's close.
My people live the forest.

105
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,269
It's okay. Go on.

106
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,830
All right. Find your home
and raise the alarm.

107
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:00,963
Yes, sir!

108
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:10,111
Good lord!
Again with this?

109
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:13,887
Sasha! You can't always
be stuffin' your face!

110
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:15,789
Give it here!

111
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:17,090
Spit it out!

112
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:18,937
We're smokin' that
for the winter!

113
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,361
Oh, for cryin' out loud!

114
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:33,246
You little...
Show some restraint!

115
00:07:33,432 --> 00:07:35,942
Fine.

116
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:37,590
Eat your fill.

117
00:07:37,786 --> 00:07:40,486
Hm! Idiot kid.

118
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,418
Sasha. Look around ya.

119
00:07:52,594 --> 00:07:55,785
Ever wonder how things
got to be the way they are?

120
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:58,316
Why the forest is disappearing?

121
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:01,496
Why game's so hard
to come by these days?

122
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,816
Or doesn't it concern you?

123
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:06,226
Sure it does.

124
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:08,285
People are comin' in here
and helping themselves

125
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:09,743
to what used to be ours.

126
00:08:09,894 --> 00:08:12,300
It's why I'm hungry
all the time.

127
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,902
Yeah, that's true.

128
00:08:15,238 --> 00:08:16,764
On the face of it.

129
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,706
But where else
you expect folks to go

130
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:20,153
when they lose their homes?

131
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:22,322
They've got a right
to live, don't they?

132
00:08:22,456 --> 00:08:24,410
It's their fault
for losin' their homes.

133
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:27,347
Not like that gives 'em
the right to steal.

134
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,628
They lost their homes
'cause of Titans.

135
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,499
Monsters punched a hole
clean through Wall Maria.

136
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:35,261
Where else were people gonna go?

137
00:08:36,206 --> 00:08:39,372
Wasn't their choice.
They had to survive somehow,

138
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:43,310
so they cleared the forest
and used it for farmland.

139
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:49,050
Maybe it's time
for us to let go.

140
00:08:49,318 --> 00:08:52,371
Surrender the old ways.

141
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:54,287
We're not gonna starve.

142
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:56,456
Government's willing
to pay us, y'know.

143
00:08:56,675 --> 00:08:58,519
We'll make money raising horses.

144
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,127
What? If we
turn our back on hunting,

145
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:02,902
we turn our back on who we are!

146
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:04,675
Why should I care about
what happens to the people

147
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:05,810
who've always looked down as us

148
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:07,400
like we were a bunch of savages?

149
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:09,386
I'll tell you why.

150
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,872
We're in this together.

151
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:15,152
The world belongs to each
and every one of us.

152
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:19,191
We're human.
Humans are social animals.

153
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,136
It's all fine
and good to move to

154
00:09:21,198 --> 00:09:24,360
the beat of your own drum,
but when land is scarce,

155
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:26,464
you've got to fall
in step with the herd.

156
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:27,921
Think about the greater good.

157
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:29,701
No! I won't do it!

158
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,160
We've lived here all our lives

159
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,738
the way our ancestors
taught us to.

160
00:09:32,816 --> 00:09:34,361
I'm not gonna change!

161
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:37,564
Screw the "greater good"!
What about us?

162
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:43,069
Right, then.

163
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,988
If that's how you really feel.

164
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:50,139
Eke out a living in these woods.

165
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,933
Live by the old ways,
like the others.

166
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,445
But I'll tell you something,

167
00:09:56,738 --> 00:09:59,449
you'd best be willing to
die by the old ways, too.

168
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:03,401
'Cause make no mistake, Sasha,

169
00:10:03,527 --> 00:10:05,808
trouble is coming
sooner or later.

170
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:07,535
And when it does,

171
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:09,566
there'll be no begging for help

172
00:10:09,714 --> 00:10:12,730
from the people
you've turned your back on.

173
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:14,546
If it means
the difference between

174
00:10:14,652 --> 00:10:17,203
being a part of something
larger than myself

175
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:20,714
and scraping by on my own,
I say screw tradition.

176
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:23,503
It's time to move on.

177
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:25,576
What about you?

178
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:28,581
Are you brave enough
to take that step with me?

179
00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:30,925
Trade the wilderness
of your ancestors

180
00:10:30,986 --> 00:10:33,558
for a share in civilization?

181
00:10:33,777 --> 00:10:37,277
Or is our fellow man
just not worth the hassle?

182
00:10:40,144 --> 00:10:42,894
How long
has it been? Three years?

183
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,633
Surely he'd have had the sense
to pick up and leave by now.

184
00:10:50,005 --> 00:10:53,386
Impossible!
All the way out here?

185
00:10:57,446 --> 00:11:00,183
Can they really
have gotten this far?

186
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:04,751
That's does it.
This place isn't safe anymore.

187
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,691
Whoa.
When did that get built?

188
00:12:04,746 --> 00:12:09,163
♪♪ Music plays, volume increases...

189
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:13,100
♪♪

190
00:12:30,505 --> 00:12:33,073
Shit!
If I don't cut it off,

191
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:34,874
it'll just keep healing!

192
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:46,758
Oh no.

193
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,422
I'm so sorry. Forgive me.

194
00:13:11,246 --> 00:13:13,413
You got a name, sweetie?

195
00:13:16,148 --> 00:13:18,239
I know you're scared,
but it'll be okay.

196
00:13:18,386 --> 00:13:19,766
What will?

197
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,977
Uh. Well, um,
actually, I, uh...

198
00:13:23,258 --> 00:13:25,992
Uh, easy now, easy.
Right, so.

199
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:28,628
The thing is,
I'm going to take you...

200
00:13:30,065 --> 00:13:31,998
You do this now? Really?

201
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:33,990
Ugh! Wait for us!

202
00:13:36,438 --> 00:13:38,471
Okay. No need
to worry, understand?

203
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:40,173
He'll be right back, I promise.

204
00:13:40,242 --> 00:13:42,536
How come you're talking
so nice to me?

205
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:44,036
Huh?

206
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:54,165
We need to run!

207
00:13:57,092 --> 00:13:59,186
It's gonna be okay!

208
00:13:59,694 --> 00:14:03,428
No it won't.
Everyone's already gone.

209
00:14:03,765 --> 00:14:05,198
The whole village.

210
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:07,780
Even though
Mama's legs were bad.

211
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,703
They knew, and none
of them came to help her.

212
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:13,186
All I could do was watch.

213
00:14:32,327 --> 00:14:34,694
Don't look back!
Just keep running!

214
00:14:37,261 --> 00:14:39,461
It's gonna be okay.

215
00:14:42,237 --> 00:14:44,182
You're startin'
to piss me off.

216
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:45,533
Huh?

217
00:14:45,707 --> 00:14:48,549
Why you gotta be so
friggin' polite all the time?

218
00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:52,779
What, you above talking
like one of us plebes?

219
00:14:52,856 --> 00:14:56,697
Well, actually.
No, not at all.

220
00:14:57,057 --> 00:14:59,697
Oh yeah?
So why don't'cha, then?

221
00:14:59,783 --> 00:15:01,632
Scared we'll hear
where you're from

222
00:15:01,705 --> 00:15:03,533
if you let your guard down?

223
00:15:03,658 --> 00:15:04,979
That's it, isn't it?

224
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,760
Oh, wow.
Kinda blows my mind.

225
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:09,529
Why do you even care?

226
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:12,127
I mean, it's like a wild boar
getting all bent outta shape

227
00:15:12,221 --> 00:15:14,463
'cause someone's bad-mouthing
him behind his back.

228
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:16,799
Be honest: the military's
your last hope

229
00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:17,947
of being respectable.

230
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:19,443
Your folks're probably
first cousins...

231
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:20,924
Ymir, stop it!
You're being mean!

232
00:15:20,996 --> 00:15:22,924
Whatever! Hey,
you gonna pretend to be

233
00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:25,088
someone you're not for
the rest of your damn life,

234
00:15:25,143 --> 00:15:26,579
or you gonna be Sasha?

235
00:15:26,658 --> 00:15:28,752
Take it from me, honey:
acting like you think

236
00:15:28,838 --> 00:15:31,084
people want you to act
is a crock of shit.

237
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:33,586
Don't censor yourself!

238
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:37,533
Um. Thank you very much?

239
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,433
I appreciate the advice.

240
00:15:39,594 --> 00:15:40,927
Really?

241
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,049
Sorry, I-I'm not
really sure what to say.

242
00:15:44,138 --> 00:15:46,377
Leave her alone!
It's her life!

243
00:15:46,455 --> 00:15:50,088
If she wants to talk politely
to people, why do <i>you</i> care?

244
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,408
Sasha is who she chooses to be.

245
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:56,135
It's called
reinventing yourself.

246
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,979
Whatever she says,
it's still her.

247
00:15:59,283 --> 00:16:01,614
Heh. Well, aren't
we philosophical.

248
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,112
I say however she tries
to sound on the outside,

249
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:06,819
the inside Sasha'll always
be a pain in the ass.

250
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,699
Knock it off!
Would it kill you

251
00:16:08,744 --> 00:16:10,955
to show some compassion
every now and again?

252
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:14,119
E-Excuse me?
I'm just bein' real!

253
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,180
Compassion.

254
00:16:16,398 --> 00:16:18,498
Hey!
What are <i>you</i> laughing at?

255
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:21,234
Uh. Nothing! Sorry!

256
00:16:28,243 --> 00:16:31,444
Really? Why is
that coming back now?

257
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,908
Of all the stupid things
for me to dwell on.

258
00:16:34,316 --> 00:16:38,217
Still, it's the only thing
I can think about.

259
00:16:40,822 --> 00:16:43,040
All right, listen.

260
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:44,477
You're gonna be fine.

261
00:16:44,548 --> 00:16:46,426
Just keep following
the path we're on.

262
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:48,995
Run as far away as you can.

263
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:52,165
There'll be someone
willing to help. I promise.

264
00:16:52,368 --> 00:16:54,517
It may take you
a little while to find them.

265
00:16:54,736 --> 00:16:58,705
But keep on! You'll bump
into them eventually!

266
00:16:58,773 --> 00:17:01,507
Now go. Get out of here!

267
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,014
Don't give up hope!

268
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:24,875
If I can take out the eyes,

269
00:17:24,986 --> 00:17:27,433
it should buy us enough time.

270
00:17:32,162 --> 00:17:33,237
Eeh!

271
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,132
Damn it. Only two left!

272
00:17:36,644 --> 00:17:39,045
Relax. It's nothing.

273
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,360
Just a big...
slow-moving...

274
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:45,352
target!

275
00:17:46,354 --> 00:17:48,388
Bull's eye!

276
00:17:51,593 --> 00:17:55,780
Last arrow.
If I miss, that'll be it.

277
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:04,674
End of story.
Period. I'll be...

278
00:18:05,173 --> 00:18:07,073
She'll be...

279
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:36,605
I slipped out
because of the blood.

280
00:18:36,905 --> 00:18:38,488
Now to find the girl!

281
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,582
Is that Sasha?

282
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,555
We've been
doing what we can.

283
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:09,586
Giving horses
to folks who need 'em.

284
00:19:09,718 --> 00:19:11,523
That little girl
told us there was someone

285
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:13,806
back behind her on the road.

286
00:19:13,992 --> 00:19:16,961
Said they helped.
Saved her, 'n fact.

287
00:19:17,245 --> 00:19:20,414
Apparently fought off
a Titan single-handed.

288
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:22,453
Mm.

289
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,578
Nicely done.
I'm proud of ya.

290
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:30,062
Thanks, Dad.

291
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:34,511
It's good to be home.

292
00:19:37,298 --> 00:19:40,666
Conny, slow down!
Get ahold of yourself!

293
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:43,499
There could be Titans
around every corner!

294
00:19:43,671 --> 00:19:45,838
Wait for us!

295
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:50,335
This isn't real.

296
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:58,882
Hello? Can anybody hear me?

297
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:01,988
Somebody! Please!
It's Conny!

298
00:20:02,053 --> 00:20:05,388
I came home!

299
00:20:13,668 --> 00:20:15,568
Find my house!

300
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:24,245
Dad. Mom.
Sunny and Martin!

301
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:27,346
Please just be okay.

302
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,003
What are you doing?
Get back!

303
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:48,396
But it, it's my house.

304
00:20:48,591 --> 00:20:50,203
I...

305
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:51,763
Conny.

306
00:20:52,106 --> 00:20:53,724
Cadets, fall back!

307
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,309
I'll scout out the area!

308
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:00,763
What the hell?
This is new.

309
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:02,771
Can it move?

310
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:05,419
Not with those legs.

311
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:07,732
But... then...

312
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,708
I don't understand.

313
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,474
