1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,880
They first appeared over a hundred years ago

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,280
Giant humanoid creatures with a tease for our blood

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,960
The brute strength of these separations 
trumped an average person's many times over

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,180
We were shoved to the brink of extinction 
Almost overnight

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,480
The survivors erected walls 
Maria, Rose and Sina

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,220
Withdrawing behind them and frightened Huddle's
For what was to be a century of uneasy peace

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,680
And then

8
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,540
The Titan assault on Trost left us reeling owing at least 
in part to the Scout regiments absence at the time

9
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,820
Military casualties were...profound

10
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,240
Ironically they'd embarked on a
reconnaissance mission beyond the wall

11
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,480
that very morning

12
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,480
Heads up the main unit of the Scout
regiment is back

13
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,920
That's right commander Erwin
did you give those ugly bastards a thrashing?

14
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,500
Look it's captain Levi

15
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,780
They say he's like an entire brigade to himself

16
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,280
spare me please

17
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,160
That scowl will crush your fans not any of my business

18
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,000
But from a public relations standpoint you might like not

19
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,520
Wow the threshold of Titania

20
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,200
Can't you just envision the horrors 
that stow for us comrades ?

21
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,220
I'm on pins and needles 
we bagged an abnormal embarrassed with tears

22
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,380
I think we've bagged the craziest abnormal already

23
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,320
What's seriously? where ?

24
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,220
I mean you

25
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,720
Move out

26
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,720
The Scout regiments primary function is
to establish bases of expansion

27
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,560
Acting as a spearhead for human knowledge
theirs is a solemn and dangerous honor

28
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,820
Thanks to the ingenuity of its exemplary members 
the regiment's survival rates have improved

29
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:48,780
That said, excursions into long relinquished territory
 still  commonly result in a death toll exceeding 30%

30
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,960
A stark illustration of the disparity 
between our own strength

31
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,000
And that of the Titans

32
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,520
One day...one day you will all just be a bad memory

33
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,380
Mankind will destroy all of you

34
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,020
Mark my words the last one standing

35
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,140
Will be us

36
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,020
Of course why you'd care, you bastard

37
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,420
Just wait till captain Levi

38
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,980
One on the right, two on the left

39
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,040
[Petra]: Captain the reinforcement are here sir

40
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,760
Good tent to our comrade below Petra 
You two, take out the Titan to your right

41
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,860
The pair on the left belongs to me

42
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,080
Captain wait

43
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,020
Don't be scared big guy I wont hurt you 
cross my heart and hope to die

44
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,140
See? bet you barely felt a thing

45
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,260
I mere you can't help being headless

46
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,080
But I can't help being tired of looking at you

47
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:49,420
Uh oh, easy big stuff 
nobody's got time for crybaby

48
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,060
Let's take it like a man shall we?

49
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,580
Disgusting

50
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,920
[Petra]: Captain I...I can't stop the bleeding

51
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,400
Captain...Levi

52
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,900
I'm here

53
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,820
Did...

54
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,620
Did this...make a difference?

55
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,560
Was that...

56
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,000
Was that helpful?

57
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,880
Please, sir...

58
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,920
Don't tell me this was for nothing

59
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,640
Tell me this life is the cost

60
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,440
We've made great strides today soldier 
and tomorrow, because of you

61
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,480
Your strength won't die with you 
the torch will be carried on by me

62
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,760
This I swear on my very life 
the Titans will be eradicated

63
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,160
Sir

64
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,580
I'm sorry, he's...

65
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,440
Did the man hear what I had to say? any of it?

66
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,820
Yes sir, matter of fact I think he heard all of it

67
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,200
Look at him that's a face at peace

68
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,840
We can help

69
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,960
[Erwin]: Levi

70
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,700
We're pulling out

71
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:41,880
Sir ?

72
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,620
What do you mean? you damn well know 
that we can push further

73
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,780
My men didn't die to pave our retreat

74
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,400
[Erwin]: There's a swarm of Titans moving north 
they're bearing down on the city

75
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,060
It's just like five years ago

76
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,900
Something tells me this is going to be bad

77
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,600
For all we know the walls 
already been reduced to rubble

78
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,920
Damn you

79
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,440
Damn you

80
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,700
This...this isn't real

81
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,820
We were ready...we were ready

82
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,320
We had the books we trained

83
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,520
This isn't a mystery to us anymore

84
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,840
We knew how to beat them 
How to survive

85
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,660
Help me...it's soo hot

86
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,940
I need to go home

87
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,180
Mom would be worried

88
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,640
I hope she went home

89
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,140
Oh...mom

90
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,760
Oh...mom

91
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,520
Help me...please

92
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:32,740
How has it come to this? 
why has everything been taken from us

93
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,340
Our lives

94
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,320
Our dreams

95
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,460
Everything

96
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,680
Damn you...damn you all to hell

97
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,780
I refuse to die like this

98
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,460
I'll drag them all out, kill them with my bare hands

99
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,600
Do you hear me?

100
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,960
With my bare hands

101
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,540
This isn't your world...not anymore

102
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,440
I'll kill every last one of you

103
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,640
Get up

104
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,800
Get up

105
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,060
Let me kill you again, and again, and again

106
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,220
You're mine all of you

107
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,980
You're all gonna die

108
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,200
Eren?

109
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,200
You're right ?

110
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,600
Look at me Eren hey can you move ?

111
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,900
Can you hear me ? say something listen 
you've got to tell them everything

112
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,160
They're terrified but they'll understand

113
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,440
Armin why...

114
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,820
You catch that he said we're all gonna die

115
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,540
There's not much else you can make of that

116
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,720
Son of a bitch wants to eat us you watch

117
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,260
What the hell are they talking about

118
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,880
What is this

119
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,120
Why are all their blades pointed at us
Those are meant for taking down Titans

120
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,140
What's going on ?

121
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,020
And what's with that look

122
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,680
Are they terrified of me?

123
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,040
I want all you cadets on standby look sharp

124
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,880
If we hadn't found the gas 
we'd have never gotten out of a Trost

125
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,640
Basically we got lucky that's it

126
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,880
That sounds terrible I'm so sorry

127
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,780
We volunteered to run supplies out to everyone 
but the situation was so bad

128
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,840
We did even found some gas we were gonna 
dole out to you guys but then everything went to hell

129
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,300
So you're saying everyone who isn't here now 
didn't...uh you know

130
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,740
Yeah

131
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,880
Wait what about Mikasa ?

132
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,059
Huh yeah no no she's good she made
it in after us with the group Jean led

133
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,900
Hey Jean where in the world's Mikasa 
she got hurt or what ?

134
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,260
hey talk to us

135
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,800
I would tell you if I could 
they slapped us with a gag order

136
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,900
Whoa you're joking right ?

137
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,000
That's nuts

138
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:54,460
They're nuts if they think people aren't gonna talk 
or it'll get out, and when it does

139
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,940
Well that is if we survive

140
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:09,200
You gotta hand it to the engineering corps for putting 
the heap of rents at Titan corpses to good use I suppose

141
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,880
Still just a barricade though 
we can't get too comfortable

142
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,800
Stay on your toes whatever happens next 
it's bound to happen here

143
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,420
This is the proverbial line in the sand

144
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,880
Hey something wrong ?

145
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,520
Sir, my apologies I completely agree

146
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,980
I'm just a little preoccupied about my friends in the vanguard

147
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,660
There was a messenger on the way to HQ 
with this look on his face

148
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:39,040
Kid, difficult as it may be you've got to wrangle 
your mind to stay focused on what's here in front of us

149
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,920
Is it true what they say about you 
saving those kids five years ago, sir ?

150
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,340
They're cadets now right ? 
won't they be at the vanguard too ?

151
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,140
That's right ?

152
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm really sorry, sir

153
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,180
Don't know why I felt the need to bring it up 
[Hannes]: They are good

154
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,040
Some tough little bastards believe me 
they know what it takes to stay alive

155
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,860
One of them's just about the best fighter I've ever seen

156
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,440
The other so stubborn 
it can drive you crazy Loads of inner strength

157
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,740
And their friends a certifiable genius

158
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,020
They will be fine, not a doubt in my mind

159
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,160
Cadets Eren jaeger, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Alert

160
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,480
The three of you have jointly committed an act of high treason

161
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,220
Whether or not the swift execution 
as a result depends on you

162
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,040
What?

163
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,580
Any attempt to move from where you stand now

164
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:36,500
Anything I deem at least bit suspicious
will be met with cannon fire, do not test me

165
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:45,320
Answer carefully Eren Jaeger
what exactly are you ?, human or Titan ?

166
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,720
What is that supposed to mean ? 
why they all glaring at me like that ?

167
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,100
It's like...like they're looking at a monster

168
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,400
Oh God, is that what they think?

169
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,380
I'm sorry, sir I don't understand

170
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,960
Son of a bitch is playing innocent

171
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,880
Answer me damn you evasion
will get you nowhere

172
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,920
Don't try to stall it pretend ignorance

173
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,020
Won't stand a chance you'll be blown to hell 
before you can assume your true form

174
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,060
What true form ?

175
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,600
Please the all of us saw it happen

176
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,860
You emerge from the carcass of a fallen Titan
in full view of your comrades

177
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:29,580
A creature of unknown origin ability or a legion 
to slip through and infiltrated wall Rose

178
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,160
And that creature is you

179
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,200
Under the circumstances you're being
sanctioned by His Majesty is neither here nor there

180
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,320
You are risk and I willing with my rights to eliminate

181
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,060
I will not let the situation stand

182
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,480
Every moment I squander mulling 
over your supposed innocence

183
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,840
Puts us all in further jeopardy 
from attack by the Armored Titan

184
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,200
Hell we're all I'm aware you're attached 
to diversion precisely for that purpose

185
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,220
I'm sorry humanity's fate hangs in the balance
I cannot waste any more time or manpower on you

186
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,640
Do you understand ? 
my conscious will not falter to watch you die

187
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,120
[Rico]: Nor should it, as soldiers 
they all know the price of their position

188
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,740
If they're this committed to defiance 
under threat of death so be it

189
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,900
They won't be persuaded,
and as you say it's just a waste of time

190
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,760
Sir, please this may be our best chance

191
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,940
Will expend far less artillery if he's in human form

192
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,680
Excuse me I wouldn't not while I'm standing here

193
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:36,400
Unless anyone's feeling up to the task in which case 
well, I'm happy to demonstrate my own technique

194
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,920
On you and every last inch of your traitorous flesh

195
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:48,260
Sir, there's something you should know 
She was assigned to the elites fresh out of training

196
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:54,700
Equal to a hundred soldiers easily 
if we lost her it'd be quite the tragedy

197
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,660
Okay somebody talk to me now the

198
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,600
The hell is all this

199
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,440
Mikasa you can't take them all on

200
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,440
Even if you took down a few 
there's nowhere left for you to run

201
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,140
Whoever comes at Eren deals with me
I'll take on the entire regiment if I have to

202
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,780
I don't give a damn what they tried it through with us

203
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:18,500
This isn't the only way they're just scared 
they don't understand what's happening

204
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,900
we need to calm down and just talk it out

205
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,160
Am I the only one here 
who doesn't think I'm a Titan ?...damn it

206
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,760
Why can't I remember how I got here

207
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,320
Too weak to stand up and if I say the wrong thing ...

208
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,620
Is this it for me ?, killed by people ?

209
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:45,000
What was that he said about me 
coming out of the Titan carcass in front of everyone

210
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,740
Is he insane ?, why is no one making any sense ?

211
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,120
That was all just a dream...

212
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,760
Or

213
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,360
No

214
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,960
My sleeve...my arm

215
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,660
Am I really one of them?

216
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,460
It's not possible it's just now...

217
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,880
One more time...are you a human being or Titan?

218
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,500
I...I don't know what to say
my life is not the only one at stake

219
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:28,460
But I mean...I've always been...one of you

220
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,160
I'm Human

221
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:45,100
So you say, I'm left with no choice

222
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,720
Forgive me

223
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,020
If push comes to shove

224
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,740
All of us are monsters

225
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,680
Armin head for the wall
I've got Eren

226
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,680
Wait, no...ah

227
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
[Grisha]: Eren

228
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,300
Behave while I'm gone and 
I'll let you in on what I've been doing in the cellar

229
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,500
Listen to me it's vital 
that you keep this key on you at all times

230
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:33,400
Whenever you look at it let this thought
flood over you...I must return to that cellar

231
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,680
I'm going to give you a little something
to make you forget for the time being

232
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:47,060
I'm sorry I wish there was more time to
explain all this when the time comes though

233
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,870
Know that you must reclaim wall Maria
and head for the cellar

234
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,280
Won't both be pleasant but in my heart 
I know what I'm doing is for the best

235
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,340
When the ability confuses you let 
their memories act as your guide

236
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,080
Eren!

237
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,420
One day the truth will come out I swear to you

238
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,440
The journey will be a painful one but it is yours to make

239
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,100
Mikasa's life, Armin's life everyone's life

240
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,460
It is on your being able to control this power

241
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,520
Did we get him?

242
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,000
Dear God

243
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:58,270
Armin pleads for the life of his friend
desperate to convince their comrades

244
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:03,160
Eren isn't the monster he seems
but however eloquent however passionate

245
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,370
Reason finds no hold and Minds wracked by fear
