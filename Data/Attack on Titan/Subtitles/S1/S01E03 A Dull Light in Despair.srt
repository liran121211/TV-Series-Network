1
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,160
Hey mobtop!

2
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,660
Sir!

3
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,260
What do they call you maggot?

4
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,040
Armin Arlert from Shiganshina sir!

5
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,440
Wow seriously? why would your parents 
curse you with such a dumb name?

6
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,940
It was my grandfather sir

7
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,160
[Keith Sadies]: Cadet Arlert, why is it rot like you here?
[Armin]: To help you man may overcome the Titans

8
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,860
[Keith Sadies]: That is delightful to hear 
you're gonna be a great light snack for them

9
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,100
Row three about-face front

10
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,100
-what do you call yourself? 
-Sir!

11
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,920
My name is Thomas Wagner I'm from the trost district

12
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,020
I can't hear you !

13
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,120
(I'm from Trost sir My-)

14
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,760
Look at him go

15
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,000
The man is a master when it comes
to fresh face recruits

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,720
That takes me back

17
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,220
-You!
-Sir, Mina Carolina from Trost

18
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,720
Is a pathetic worm like you 
the best Carolina's has to offer?

19
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,880
Sir, I'm afraid that's the case, sir

20
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,400
What's the point of all  the intimidation?
it's a rite of passage

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,500
Through stress and integration 
we revert them into blank slates

22
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,420
From there we can mold and bit-by-bit into proper soldiers

23
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,000
he is the first step in that process we

24
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,400
We seem to really excelled that back home, sir

25
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,980
Row Four about-face

26
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,740
There's some he's passing by

27
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,140
A drill instructor is nothing compare that
what those recruits have seen

28
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,920
They were their witnesses to the hell 
of the Titan attack two years ago

29
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,720
You can read it in their faces

30
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,220
come on let's go

31
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,700
-what do we have over here?
-Jean Kirschtein, sir from the Trost district

32
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,500
And why are you here cadet?

33
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,380
To join the military police, sir the best of the best

34
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,220
That's nice you want to live in the interior do ya?

35
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,260
yes

36
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,260
No one told you to sit recruit

37
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,380
If you can't handle this Kirschtein 
forget about joining the military police

38
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,920
What the hell is wrong with your face you smiling idiot

39
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,400
Marco Bott at your service, sir from GA 
South side of wall Rose

40
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,500
I am to join the military police
and give life and limit service to the king

41
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,960
Well then, that makes you an idealistic fool and a rube

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,120
You want the truth?

43
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,820
The only use the King has 
for your life and limbs are as Titan fodder

44
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,300
Hey Q-ball you're up next

45
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,260
Oh me, sir Connie Springer for Rakago village, sir

46
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,620
You have it backwards Connie Springer 
That was the first thing you were taught

47
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,980
This Salute represents the resolve in your heart

48
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,860
To fight though spent on 
the systematic destruction of our people

49
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,580
Is your heart on your right side?

50
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,760
Hey you there, what're you think you doing?

51
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,520
You're officially on my shitlist 
Just who's the hell are you?

52
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,580
Sasha Blouse from Dauper village
Reporting for duty, sir

53
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Sasha Blouse huh? 
And what is that you're clutching in your right hand?

54
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,280
A steamed potato it's sat there 
in the mess hall begging to be eaten sir

55
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,280
The theft I understand 
But here?

56
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,040
Why eat it here of all places ?

57
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,100
It looks quite delicious and it was getting cold

58
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,780
So I gave it shelter in my stomach, sir

59
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,620
why? I can't comprehend

60
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,800
Why would you eat that potato?

61
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,760
Are you asking me why people eat potatoes?
 I'm surprised you don't know, sir

62
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,780
Here sir, have half

63
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,220
Have half? really?

64
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,220
Man I thought Sadies was gonna kill potato girl

65
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,691
Know what a hell of a first day

66
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,060
It's funny!

67
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,340
Being told to run to the Sun sets

68
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,980
Didn't seem to bother her nearly as much
As losing meal privileges for the next five days

69
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,880
I think she said that she's from Dauper

70
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,860
If I remember right that's a small
hunting village up in the mountains

71
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,980
-Hey what's? 
-That there dropouts

72
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,460
They prefer to work in the fields

73
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,220
But it's only the first day!

74
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:09,260
That's the way it is,
If you can't handle the pressure you've gotta leave

75
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,500
I can't believe anyone would rather 
pull plants than fight!

76
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,360
I know about some of us but you never 
mentioned where you were from Eren

77
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,520
The same as Armin from Shiganshina

78
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,060
Oh well that means you saw it
 you were there that day

79
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,180
-Quiet
-The colossal one, did you see him?

80
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,780
Yeah, yeah I did

81
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,540
Yeah okay, I saw the big guy

82
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,760
-Whoa seriously?
-Okay exactly how tall was he?

83
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:46,160
-He stuck his head over the outer wall
-Oh wait, I heard he stepped over the wall completely

84
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,260
-So did I 
-That was the rumor in my village too

85
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,740
Yeah he was big but not that big

86
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,120
So what did it look like?

87
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,500
It had a mouth like a corpse and no skin just muscles

88
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,760
And the Armored Titan? 
The one that broke through wall Maria?

89
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,280
Is that what they're calling it? 
And all the panic it was just another Titan to me

90
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,280
No way so what were they like?

91
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,360
Come on, that's enough questions all right

92
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm sure he'd rather not relive 
everything he went through

93
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,560
Sorry we didn't mean to- 
It's not like

94
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,660
That those stupid Titans 
they're really not that big a deal

95
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,400
If we focus on mastering 
the Omni-Directional Mobility gear they give us

96
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,760
Then it'sTitan payback time

97
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,540
I've waited years to be trained as a soldier

98
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,631
All of a sudden the reality is sinking in

99
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,580
I'm joining the Scout regiment 
Then I'm sending the Titans back to hell

100
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,480
I'm gonna butcher them all!

101
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,760
Hey are you crazy or something?

102
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,640
Not that it's my business but signing up
For reconnaissance is like a death sentence

103
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,480
I guess we'll see or at least I will

104
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,400
you see content hiding in the interior with the MPs

105
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,720
look I'm just speaking honestly here kid

106
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,065
I think it's better than being some loudmouth 
braggart tough-guy wannabe pretending

107
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:12,900
He's not as pissed scared as the rest of us

108
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,740
-Are you trying to pick a fight? 
-Stop it you guys

109
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,380
Alright sure, makes no difference to me

110
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:34,780
Hey I apologize sorry for calling you
names and dismissing your choice of career

111
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,980
Put it there kid what do you say?

112
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:42,500
Right, yeah I'm sorry as well

113
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,400
Um...Excuse me!

114
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:05,220
I just wanted- 
I mean I've never seen anyone like you before

115
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,940
I'm mean..uh

116
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,120
I'm sorry, you have really beautiful black hair

117
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,040
Thank You

118
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,540
Would you lay off it's no big deal

119
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,540
It's just that you get so worked up
You don't think things through

120
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,580
Again with this? if you insist on worry
worry about how long your hair is

121
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,040
It's gonna catch up with you in a bad way
when we start on the ODMs

122
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,500
Okay fine, I'll cut it

123
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,240
How short should I go do you think?

124
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,640
What the hell !?
leave my clothes alone damn it

125
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,220
What did you wipe on me?

126
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,340
Don't worry just my trust

127
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,420
Finished

128
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,260
It's gotta be!

129
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,260
It's bread!

130
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,060
I'm sorry there isn't more it's all i could take

131
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,800
Hey hang on, you really should drink a little water first

132
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,560
Just what are you two girls up to?

133
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,540
Well...she has been running all day
without any food or water

134
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,600
I see so you're trying to be nice

135
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,039
What's the point of breaking the rulesfor potato girl

136
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,300
That mindless act of kindness 
gets you absolutely nowhere

137
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,780
Whatever

138
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,520
Let's just get her to bed already

139
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,980
I'm confused are you being nice?

140
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,980
I'm helping her so that she'll owe me one in the future

141
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,940
I intend to make use of her stupidity

142
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,880
It's aptitude test time so listen up

143
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,060
there is no place for you here of you cannot perform

144
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,880
fail and be shipped to the fields

145
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,918
We're just drilling the fundamentals here

146
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,420
You can still determine a cadet's 
knack for it just by watching

147
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,260
Like her completely steady, she inherently 
knows what to do and how to make it happen

148
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,180
That's what aptitude is all about

149
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,800
-I'd say we have several capable cadets this year
-And what about this guy?

150
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,440
That's precisely why we run these tests

151
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,120
He proves the drive and dedication 
do not always translate into capability

152
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,040
What is your bench about function Yeager

153
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,140
straight yourself up

154
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,820
Why am I ?
How do I work this thing?

155
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,080
This can't be happening

156
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,720
Just remember the basics and you should be fine 
No need to try any fancy maneuvers

157
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,840
Just focus on your balance,
Then distribute your weight evenly

158
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,140
Between the belts on your waist and your
legs

159
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,200
Loosen up your stance a little bit 
If I could do it I know that you can

160
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,080
Okay a loose stance but balanced
Let's give it a shot Armin

161
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,700
Hey Daz

162
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,660
He was talking big about butchering all the Titans 
but he got real quiet after ODM training didn't he?

163
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,140
I guess it's the fields for him tomorrow,
Can't keep wasting food on the useless

164
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,140
Eren

165
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,300
Worrying won't solve a thing 
There's still time to get some practice income morning

166
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,340
How pathetic how am I supposed to kill them 
if I can't even stand up straight

167
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,120
It might be time to let that dream die

168
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,600
What do you mean?

169
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,620
I think you should give up this attempt to be a soldier

170
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,280
There's a lot more to fighting and combat 
than just throwing your life away in vain

171
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,420
What are you saying after everything we saw that day 
After what happened to my mom

172
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,300
You're crazy if you think I'm just gonna walk away

173
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,820
I get it 
But it doesn't matter how determined you are

174
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,140
Wait what do you mean?

175
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,800
because whether or not you're fit 
to be a soldier, isn't up to you

176
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,700
-You misunderstand 
(-Let's go)
-I'm not saying you should return to the fields by yourself

177
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:22,280
I wouldn't dream of it
Because wherever you go I'm gonna go with you

178
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,940
So are you saying that 
you are not going to finish that?

179
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,320
What's the trick to posture control?
hard to say guess I got the gift

180
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,632
you've just got to feel it you know

181
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,100
I'm trying to figure out your trick 
you've screwed up every way imaginable

182
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,120
Short of an accidental equipment related asphyxiation

183
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,680
Please guys you gotta help me 
I'm begging you

184
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:14,100
That's funny wasn't it just yesterday you said 
if you can't handle the pressure you gotta leave?

185
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,660
No wait was it if you're a complete idiot you gotta leave
Something like that

186
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,200
Oh come on,
I heard from everyone you're both really good at it

187
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,580
Bertholdt, Reiner!

188
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,020
Sorry kid but there isn't any special trick to just hanging there

189
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,520
Not to be harsh but if it's advice you 
well I'm not really the guy

190
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,360
-All right 
-Let's just hope it comes to you tomorrow

191
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,840
Hold on,
Aren't the two of you originally from Sheganshina?

192
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,660
Yeah that's right

193
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,960
Then you should know firsthand how terrifying they are

194
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,260
Why on earth would you want to be soldiers?

195
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:59,860
I didn't see the things Eren did he saw their bloodlust
firsthand before anyone realized how bad it was

196
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,000
And I

197
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,000
I knew I couldn't sit idly by as 
the Royal government forced the citizenry

198
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,140
Into the failed territory retrieval operation

199
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,820
-I see 
-So where the two of you from?

200
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,160
oh Reiner and I?

201
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,500
We were both from a mountain village
Just south east of wall Maria

202
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,800
What? then that means

203
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,060
Yeah unlike the more prosperous river towns

204
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,000
Our village didn't receive word right away

205
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,300
The Titans were on us 
before we even knew what was going on

206
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,620
It happened at dawn

207
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,220
All the livestock were so Restless

208
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,700
Soon after we heard these strange rumblings 
that just became louder and louder

209
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,480
Eventually I realized those rumblings 
Were the sound of death getting closer

210
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,620
I

211
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,240
I looked out my window and

212
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,700
After that

213
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,400
Well, everything is just a blur 
I think we all just panicked

214
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,040
Hey easy now 
You're just getting yourself worked up again

215
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:15,220
Sorry, basically what I've been trying to say is this 
the four of us aren't like the rest of them

216
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:20,740
-Them who?
-The others here who've never been witness 
To the Titan's horror

217
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,900
Hey

218
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:33,620
Most of them are here for show 
to do just what society expects

219
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,860
In a world where you're labeled a coward 
if you choose fieldwork

220
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,180
By the time you turn 12 
propriety demands our service

221
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,820
With that said I'm really no different from the others

222
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,360
I joined the ranks hoping for assignment 
To the military police

223
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,180
Tucked away in the interior 
If that doesn't work out I'll give up entirely

224
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,400
I don't really have the fortitude for anything else

225
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,160
There's no shame in caring about your life Bertholdt

226
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,060
We all do

227
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,520
Do we?

228
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,840
I'm going to return to the home that was taken from me

229
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,820
That's all I care about now

230
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,640
I will do it, No matter what what

231
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:25,220
What about you?
Why did you sign up?

232
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,700
why did I join?

233
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,700
I decided I have to kill them

234
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I won't stop till every 
single Titan is dead and rotting

235
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,800
Dead, every last one

236
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,960
You saw what those monsters are capable of 
and you still want to take them on?

237
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:58,680
Damn right, it's just after screwing up the training 
I don't know if I'm cut out to be a soldier

238
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:21,500
We'll take it from step one, 
Belt adjustment, by tomorrow you'll be an expert

239
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,620
I know you've got what it takes
I can see in you, Am I wrong here?

240
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,800
No, I won't fail

241
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,480
Thank you Reiner thank you

242
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:47,160
-Eren Yaeger are you ready?
-Yes sir

243
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,740
I'm going to do it I have to
I may not be as talented as the rest

244
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,180
but nobody, nobody has more guts

245
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,760
Proceed

246
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:13,020
The moment of truth I won't fail 
The hell with working the damn fields

247
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,580
I'm not giving up
Not without a fight

248
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,400
I did it?
No, I'm doing it

249
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,020
No, not yet

250
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,440
Once more, I can do it

251
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,160
[Keith Sadies]: Lower

252
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,620
I, I'm finished

253
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,340
Vogner please exchange belts 
with mr.Yeager

254
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,320
Yes, sir

255
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,100
their equipment was defective

256
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:08,200
If given a piece of functional gear 
you might not be worthless after all

257
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,420
What a master didn't notice this broken clasp

258
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,480
Might have to visit the supply depot 
and crack a couple skills

259
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,620
He still did it even while wearing that busted gear

260
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,940
Amazing!

261
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,760
So you mean I, I didn't wash out?

262
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,480
You made the cut, now keep training cadet

263
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,140
I did it, I really did it

264
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,773
Check it out Mikasa I'm doing it 
I can fight the Titans

265
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,960
You don't have to worry about me 
not anymore

266
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,740
It seems like things worked out for him 
look his eyes are saying check me out

267
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,900
They're not

268
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,160
His eyes are saying he doesn't have to loose me

269
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,140
Grisha, today should bring you pride

270
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,600
Your son is a soldier

271
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,260
After graduating from the cadets 
Eren sees mankind begin to restore it's dignity

272
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,600
We can beat the Titans

273
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,480
The moment he feels certain of this 
humanity has given a grim reminder
