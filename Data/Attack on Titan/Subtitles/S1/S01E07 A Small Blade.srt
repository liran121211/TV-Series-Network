1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,140
They first appeared over a hundred years
ago

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,600
Giant humanoid creatures with a tease for our blood

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,260
The brute strength of these separations 
trumped an average person's many times over

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,140
We were shoved to the brink of extinction 
Almost overnight

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,200
The survivors erected walls 
Maria, Rose and Sina

6
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:38,300
Withdrawing behind them and frightened Huddle's
For what was to be a century of uneasy peace

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,160
In the year 845,
Two terrifying new breeds of Titan appeared

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,820
The Colossal and the Armored

9
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,660
Barreling through the outer walls as if wholesale destruction was child's play

10
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,580
The territory counted within the circle 
of wall Maria was abandoned

11
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,420
20% of the human race perished

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,900
As the Titan onslaught advanced our only choice 
was to his draw behind Wall Rose

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,320
In the year 850 
The Colossal appeared once again

14
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,080
Breaching the wall bordering Trost
before disappearing

15
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,560
The Titans flooded in through the broken gate

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,860
[Armin]: Eren, No

17
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,920
No

18
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,680
Two hours later the evacuation 
of the entire populace was completed

19
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,500
As a result no civilians were lost to the Titans

20
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,160
The same cannot be said for the countless
soldiers who perished buying the people time

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,380
[Mikasa]: Eren as long as you're part of my life 
I can fight to the bitter end

22
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,900
Captain please wait, there's only a handful of us left sir

23
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,420
If the Titans were to attack her in force
we wouldn't have a chance in hell of holding them off

24
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,040
Please sir we need you here

25
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,900
Out of my way soldier we have to get going my expertise 
is needed to help direct the reinforcements

26
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,360
Behind the safety of the inner gate, Am I right?

27
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,120
Just what the hell are you implying 
they need my help reorganizing

28
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,840
Or would you rather us be overwhelmed 
due to your logistical nightmare

29
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,580
But sir if we lost those supplies

30
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,940
That's enough

31
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:16,040
Question my orders again will delay me of my duties 
and I warn you treasonous high straight through

32
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,640
Why isn't anyone going over the wall?
They must have heard the withdrawal signal?

33
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,660
It's over

34
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,100
All over

35
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,100
We're doomed

36
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,840
There

37
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,260
C'mon now

38
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,300
That musket is not enough to stop them

39
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,440
Hey Jean what are we gonna do?

40
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,420
We can't do anything

41
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,240
They finally gave us the order to withdraw

42
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,560
And we were all out of gas of course

43
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,320
I can't believe this is how it's gonna end 
because of those damned cowards

44
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,340
You mean the supply depot? what is going on?

45
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,420
Where are they?

46
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,100
They all lost their will to fight and I can understand why

47
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,920
But they abandoned their duty to supply us 
Barricading themselves inside HQ

48
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,520
And of course Titans have swarmed the place
which means we can't get the gas ourselves

49
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,120
Then why are we waiting? we gotta go,
start sending their numbers so we have a chance

50
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,780
Sitting here on this roof is totally pointless

51
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,400
Eventually the Titans are gonna come for us

52
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,780
We don't have much gas left 
we'll just waste what little we've got if we try to run

53
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,720
And without our mobility we're completely screwed

54
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,120
You're using your head for once Connie nice going

55
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,380
But I'm just not sure if we've got 
the numbers needed to pull this thing off

56
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,080
The veterans and the Vanguard force have all been killed

57
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,600
How exactly do a bunch of rookies 
pull off a suicide mission like this

58
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:33,000
I mean let's assume half of our force 
even survives the initial assault

59
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:39,300
Then what? the supply room was probably
crawling with Titans in the three or four meter range

60
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,260
I don't see us accomplishing much in there

61
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,460
It's hopeless

62
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,060
God what a dull life this turned out to be
I never even got to tell her just how I feel

63
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,400
Come on guys we can do it right, let's go

64
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,520
If we all work together 
we can make this happen, I know we can

65
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,700
All right? 
I'll take the lead

66
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,020
Armin it's time to go

67
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:28,200
[Annie]: Reiner, do we move out?
[Reiner]: Not yet we have to let them gather up first

68
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,260
[Marco]: It's no use, there's too many of them

69
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,360
I don't think any of us are going to survive this

70
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,660
I've come to accept my pending demise

71
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,940
I just wanted my death to mean something

72
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,460
Mikasa, weren't you were the rearguard ?

73
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:55,140
Annie, I know how bad things have gotten
it's selfish putting personal matters in the forefront

74
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,740
But have you seen Eren's squad?

75
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,960
Some squads made it back 
but I don't know about Eren's

76
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,300
We found Armin he's over there

77
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,240
Armin

78
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,140
Mikasa

79
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,440
I can't

80
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,440
How would I tell her what happened to Eren?

81
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,020
I survived, it means nothing

82
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,180
So useless

83
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,160
I wish I had died with him instead

84
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,200
Armin, are you okay? 
you're not hurt are you?

85
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,560
Where's Eren?

86
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,220
Armin?

87
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,240
They were ..

88
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,280
The cadets of the squad 34

89
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,580
Thomas Wagner

90
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,620
Nac Tias

91
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,120
Mylius Zeramuski

92
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,540
Mina Carolina

93
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,460
Eren Yeager

94
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,460
These brave five upheld their duties

95
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,980
They died furiously in the field of battle

96
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,320
Please no

97
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,580
His whole squad was wiped out?

98
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,800
The same will happen to us 
if we try to take on those Titans

99
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,220
I'm so sorry, Mikasa

100
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,140
It should've been me that died not Eren

101
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,500
I...

102
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,000
I couldn't do a thing

103
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,940
I'm worthless

104
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,400
Armin

105
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,720
Calm yourself we haven't got time
for you to get emotional right now

106
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,300
On your feet

107
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,800
Marco if we eliminate or bypass the Titans of HQ
we can there refuel our gear

108
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,440
Allowing us to get back over the wall 
is that assessment correct?

109
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,320
Well yeah I guess so sure

110
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,480
But there's just too many of them out there 
Even with you on point

111
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,660
I can do it

112
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,940
What?

113
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,920
I'm strong, real strong

114
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,720
None of you come close you hear me?

115
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,880
I am a warrior

116
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,840
Know this, I have the power 
to slay all of the Titans that block our path

117
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,520
Even if I have to do it alone

118
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:39,460
As far as I'm concerned 
I am surrounded by a bunch of unskilled Cowardly worms

119
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,840
You disappoint me you can just sit here 
And twiddle your thumbs and watch how it's done

120
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,420
Wait Mikasa are you out of your mind? that's crazy

121
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:52,680
You can't be serious trying to take them out by yourself?

122
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,200
There's no way you could hope to beat them

123
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,580
If I can't beat them then I die

124
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,080
But, if I win I'll live

125
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,320
And the only way to win is to fight

126
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,120
Hey!

127
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,060
You know I was expecting something more motivational

128
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,560
Your way with words was kind of a little

129
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,280
I blame everything about this on you Eren

130
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,920
Hey don't just stand there, we weren't taught 
to let our comrades fight alone

131
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,600
Unless you are a coward 
in which case stay out of my way

132
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,900
Never expected that from him

133
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,920
Hey, seriously 
c'mon you bunch of chickens

134
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,400
They're nuts

135
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,600
Damn it

136
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,780
Alright lets go

137
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,140
Hurry up, follow Mikasa avoid fighting if you can

138
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,600
And get to HQ before you run out of gas

139
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,540
Wow Mikasa is a bad ass 
how is she going so fast

140
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,180
No Mikasa is using too much gas

141
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,820
She could run out in any seconds

142
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,740
It doesn't matter how skilled she is
once we loose mobility we are as good as dead

143
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:30,100
And I see since the fail of the composure 
she's letting eternal and destructively grief

144
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,780
At any time, she could

145
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,300
Mikasa

146
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:39,900
Damn

147
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,800
Jean, you lead the rest to HQ

148
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,780
I'm going after Armin

149
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,520
I'll go with you

150
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,360
Don't be stupid
There is still Titans everywhere

151
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,240
You gotta help the others

152
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,760
It happened

153
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,660
Why this again?

154
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,140
I've lost my family

155
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,120
Why?

156
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,540
Wasn't the first time enough?

157
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,720
It's all over

158
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,780
Nothing left for them to take from me

159
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,160
It's no use
we're not getting anywhere near Headquarters

160
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,840
Unless of course if we don't mind dying

161
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,420
Shit he is out of gas

162
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,500
Stay back

163
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,480
Tom, I'll save you

164
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,440
No wait

165
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,800
I'm coming

166
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,180
Stop it

167
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Why couldn't I stop them?

168
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,120
Why didn't I stop them?
If I kept theirselves together

169
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,380
This never would've happened

170
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,420
I wasn't meant to lead

171
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,220
I'm the last person that should've been given the raids

172
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,200
No

173
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,440
No

174
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,460
No

175
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,500
This world is cruel

176
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:15,240
But it's also...it's also beautiful

177
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,500
It was a good life

178
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,360
Why?

179
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,840
I had already given up

180
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,300
So why?....why am I struggling?

181
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,340
Why..do I keep getting up?

182
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,200
Why am I still fighting?

183
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,780
I mean

184
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,460
I've lost any reason to live

185
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,440
What keeps pushing me?

186
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,860
[Eren]: Fight

187
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,180
[Eren]: Fight

188
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,900
[Eren]: Fight

189
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,320
Eren

190
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,860
[Eren]: Kill or be killed, the only way to live

191
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,820
[Eren]: Is to fight

192
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,380
I'm so sorry Eren

193
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,940
I have throw giving up

194
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,360
I'll never give up again

195
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,640
Because if I die

196
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,160
These memories of you die with me

197
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,160
That's why I'll do whatever it takes to win

198
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,100
Whatever it takes to live

199
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,860
What was that?

200
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,120
That Titan

201
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,320
He is..

202
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,980
Killing

203
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,220
He is killing the other Titan

204
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,640
Please be alright

205
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm coming for you

206
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,280
There she is

207
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,960
Mikasa are you okay?

208
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,060
Are you guys alright?

209
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,800
Yeah

210
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,000
Then we better get out of here

211
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,420
Crap! Two 15 meter Titans

212
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,060
No that one's different

213
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,540
How

214
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,400
It just finished it off 
It know exactly where the weak spot was

215
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,180
Come on guys time to split 
last thing we need is him coming our way

216
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,940
No he has no reaction to us

217
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,300
Any other Titan would have been on top of us by now

218
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,400
It seemed to understand the skill 
of hand-to-hand combat, what is that thing?

219
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,360
Just chalk it up as another abnormal

220
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,776
Hell they're always an unpleasant surprise right?

221
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,740
Forget about it let's just get out of here

222
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,780
Wait a minute hold on 
Mikasa's tanks are empty

223
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,540
Huh what are we gonna do? we can't clear HQ without your help

224
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,060
There's only one thing to do

225
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,620
I know there isn't very much left in them 
but it's better than your empty ones

226
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,620
Armin

227
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,780
This is our only choice

228
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:42,540
It would be a complete wast if i keep them, but

229
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,560
Use this gas more sparingly

230
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,240
Everyone's lives are riding on you

231
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,940
What have I done?
I led the attack without any regard for their lives at all

232
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:01,380
I was even reckless with my own life 
I lost track of what you taught me

233
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,020
Oh Eren

234
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,100
I'm so ashamed

235
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,320
Eren

236
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,060
There got it the ODM gear is functional 
And I restocked your blades

237
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,860
Just...just leave me this one okay

238
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,000
It's just that...I would rather this be my end
not being eaten alive

239
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,720
Why did you?

240
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,520
Armin

241
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,760
I will not leave you behind

242
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,860
What was he?

243
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,160
Where there anymore like him?

244
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,160
I've never heard of a Titan killing another Titan

245
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,440
no one has

246
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,400
But it struck a chord in me
something so...familiar

247
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,760
So Primary

248
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,400
I bear witness to the manifestation of humanity's rage

249
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,200
A Titan killing a Titan

250
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,960
The ferry site of an in action leaves 
the 104 Cadet Corps class completely speechless

251
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,600
However the cadets have much more in store for them
