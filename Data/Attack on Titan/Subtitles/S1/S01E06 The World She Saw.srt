1
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:43,820
Wake up, Armin hey can you hear me 
come on snap out of it

2
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,140
I need you to talk to me say something

3
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,160
There you are you with me now ? what's going on?

4
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,000
-Where's your squad ?
-Squad!

5
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,960
All right let's get you on your feet 
You shouldn't be out here alone

6
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,400
What the hell you got all over you, that's so damn slimy 
What happened?

7
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,500
[Armin]: You're worthless why can't you just die

8
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,200
[Connie]: Hey you need to pull yourself together

9
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,360
[Armin]: Damn you

10
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,560
[Connie]: Where is everyone?

11
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,560
Let it go Connie

12
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,100
-He's it the rest of them are dead
-Damn it don't talk like that we can't assume 
he's the only one

13
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,260
Take a look around you isn't it obvious

14
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,340
We can't waste any more time here with
him we've got to move on

15
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,000
You're not making any sense 
why would the Titans ignore him

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,920
I don't know maybe they thought 
he was already dead or something

17
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,300
When you get right down to it that's the real tragedy here

18
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,660
Eren and the others bust their asses 
and the one left standing is him

19
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,700
Alright that does it bitch 
I'm gonna shut your mouth up permanently

20
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,360
Both of you stop it right now

21
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,560
We all at the end of our tether okay

22
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,500
We're seeing our friends being killed like animals 
it's normal to be upset

23
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,480
Look at my Christa keeping the peace

24
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,360
You are so gonna have to marry me 
when all this crap is over

25
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,420
Yeah well should best get a hold of that mouth

26
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,400
All right come on we got to get out of here 
You able to stand?

27
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:18,769
Sorry for being non sense 
Don't worry about me

28
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,300
I was wrong this world hasn't become hell

29
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:46,000
It's been hell i just couldn't see it before now

30
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,520
We're condemned all of us have been 
from the beginning

31
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,840
Strength preys on weakness

32
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,720
It's a very straightforward arrangement actually

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,700
But...My friends they...

34
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,980
They tried

35
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,280
They knew how the world worked

36
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:18,560
They wanted to be strong for me 
someone who only brought them down

37
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,300
In their eyes i was the  victim I needed protection

38
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,540
But all i wanted was to stand shoulder to shoulder 
with them, to be strong like they were

39
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,660
To be worth something

40
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,880
Hell this is how it all ends up

41
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,220
Eren dragged to protect meand-

42
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,060
Hanna, what're you trying to do?

43
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,060
Oh God Armin Help me please

44
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,060
Franz couldn't breath in and i can't wake him up

45
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,820
He won't response to CPR

46
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,560
C'mon baby you got this stay with me

47
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,420
Somebody help us

48
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,340
Hanna please, it's not safe on the ground 
We need to get you to the rooftop-

49
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,260
No I'm not leaving him like this

50
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,780
You really don't understand, do you?

51
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,600
Hanna I'm sorry Franz is-

52
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,360
Please stop

53
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,800
Please stop doing that

54
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,580
I can't

55
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,840
I can't take it

56
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,900
This is Hell

57
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,280
What the hell is wrong with you people I don't think 
you fully appreciate how bad the situation is

58
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh I appreciate it just fine believe me

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,280
You wanna make it out of here alive 
stop whining and help

60
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,520
You're a soldier do something

61
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,320
Make him move that damn wagon

62
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,640
-I'm not exactly sure I...
-Take your best shot little man

63
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,680
I'm the president of this town's merchant guild

64
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,080
Uh well I...

65
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,040
Who do you think pays all the bills for 
the food you and your buddies crap out

66
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,440
Or maybe you got some finances clubs 
a way to fund the racket you call a job

67
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,860
Now shut up and push this cargo's worth 
more than you people make in your whole lives

68
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,520
Nobody's getting out of here unless the 
wagons in front of them

69
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,560
There's a reward in it if you help

70
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,460
don't worry sweetheart

71
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,880
Daddy's gonna use those Big Loud cannons 
he showed us to scare the Titans off

72
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,220
Mommy look

73
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,560
There

74
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,640
Push it through dam it 
If you don't that thing is gonna kill us all

75
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,000
Someone wanna tell me 
why this son of a bitch is ignoring us

76
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,500
It's an abnormal stop trying to figure him out

77
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,920
He is too fast there is no way we will ever take him before he reaches the gate

78
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,840
Just stay on him

79
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,740
Excuse me, what is all this?

80
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,625
Couldn't have asked for better timing

81
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:45,580
Force these useless morons to push my wagon
I'll pay you handsomely

82
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,020
Seriously soldiers are dying back there

83
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,420
Laid out their lives for you

84
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,760
All because this is taking too long

85
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,859
Yeah that's their job you expect me 
to shed it to you because they gotta

86
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:05,039
Fulfill the duties they signed on for
they're supposed to be willing to lay

87
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,769
Down their lives
don't get all high-handed on me just cuz

88
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:11,180
You finally got to earn your damn keep
after all these years

89
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,880
Yeah no arguing with that you're
absolutely right sir

90
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,360
Guess it's what you call the greater good

91
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,520
Still sometimes it's not the life or the death of 
a soldier that makes the biggest difference

92
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,540
Don't you even dare your commander 
and I are old friends

93
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,160
One word from me and you'll be court-martialed 
believe me

94
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,220
That word gonna come from beyond the grave?

95
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,640
No wait

96
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,140
Sir, maybe we should...

97
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,920
pull the damn wagon out

98
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,240
You're Amazing

99
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,560
You've saved our lives miss 
all of us are in your debt

100
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,480
Good work Ackerman I'm impressed

101
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,089
I did what I could here sir

102
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:49,300
But thank you I need to be a bit more
careful in the future

103
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,700
I inadvertently dulled both of the blades 
I'll do better next time

104
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,880
what on earth have you had to live to be so nonchalant

105
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,580
I'm sorry that was uncalled for

106
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,480
Why do I have to suddenly think of you now?

107
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,480
I'm finish mama

108
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,980
What do you think did I do good

109
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,060
Oh darling it's absolutely fantastic

110
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,400
Excellent work

111
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,200
Oh thank you

112
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:42,400
We've kept this style of embroidery a special 
family secret for heaven knows how many generations

113
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,300
One day when you have children of your own
you'll be able to pass the secret on to them

114
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,760
Huh...I don't understand how can I have children

115
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,140
Uh honey why don't you explain?

116
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,060
Yeah please daddy

117
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,920
well I'm not sure I'm really an expert on this subject

118
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:04,060
but you know what that nice doctor Yeager scheduled 
to pay us a visit today maybe you could talk to him

119
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,560
Haha speak of the devil

120
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,600
Just a moment

121
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,100
Her name is Mikasa?

122
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,480
Yes and she's just about your age 
try to get along okay

123
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,980
There aren't that many children around here
and I'd rather you not grow up to be an outcast

124
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,060
If she's nice to me then we wont have aproblem

125
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,840
Eren look for the bad in people 
expecting to find it and you will

126
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,660
Hmm...That's odd of them
Are they home?

127
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,960
Mr.Ackerman

128
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,560
It's doctor Yeager is anyone there?

129
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,720
Well are they aren't there?

130
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,360
Dad, what's wrong?

131
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,260
Dam it!

132
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,940
Look around can you see the daughter anywhere?

133
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,560
Perhaps she's outside

134
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,560
I don't think so

135
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,300
This is bad

136
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,580
I need to alert the military police 
of this while the trails warm

137
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,000
wait for me at the foot of the mountain understood

138
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,960
Say that back to me word for word

139
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,340
Eren!

140
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,800
Uh-huh all I'm saying is she better go for a decent price

141
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,600
I didn't get blood on my hands for nothing

142
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,180
Look at her face and tell me what she's worth

143
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,720
Sure she's cute and all just young 
wouldn't go for her myself

144
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,600
Then I guess we're lucky 
you're not the one we're selling to

145
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,740
Plenty of folks who'd pay a premium

146
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,160
She's exotic what they used to call an oriental

147
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,920
You know about all that right

148
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,060
Back when there used to be different breeds of people

149
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,100
The bunch of him from the Far East 
came scrambling here for safety

150
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,840
The old perverts in the capital 
really go for that sort of thing

151
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,460
This little beauties gonna fetch a mint at auction

152
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,020
It's great business she's the last of her kind 
all the rest of her people died out

153
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:18,040
Tell me another one it's not like she's 
a pureblood or anything, her old man wasn't oriental

154
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,120
Good point there the mother 
would have been a nice addition, right?

155
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,760
Too bad she's in pieces

156
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,040
Give me a break what was I supposed to do?
she was putting up a fight

157
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,680
So you couldn't have just knocked her unconscious?

158
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,940
We were just talking about you Doctor

159
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,460
Sorry hope we're not interrupting

160
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,900
let's take this nice and easy

161
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,900
I don't imagine anybody wants their skull open by this little guy

162
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,200
(The bitch is out of her mind) 
Run Mikasa run as fast as you can

163
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,560
Stop it you're scaring me

164
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,040
I want you to be scared

165
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,000
Move it get away from here

166
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,960
Dad!?

167
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,920
Screw it

168
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,840
You ain't want this crap

169
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,960
You stupid bastard the plan must only kill the father

170
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,040
She was nuts I'm supposed to let her go caus-

171
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,440
-I don't give a shit just bag the kid
-Fine

172
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,760
Hey let's not give me any attitude all right

173
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,780
If you're feeling feisty this is what you get

174
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,000
So cold

175
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,300
I'm sorry

176
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,920
Don't move from that spot you little farming

177
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,850
How did you even find this place?

178
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:30,020
Uh..well I was..in the woods...got...lost

179
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,100
I saw your cabinet

180
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,440
Lost in the woods huh? Kid your age 
shouldn't be out there on his own to begin with

181
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,180
Big bad wolves are liable 
to pounce on you from out of nowhere

182
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,560
It's alright now you'll be safe here 
my buddy and I'll be happy to take you-

183
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,360
I appreciate that sir, but I'm not stupid

184
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,360
And I'm the last thing you will ever see

185
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,120
What the hell do you think you doing?

186
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,760
Hey little bastard get back here

187
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,020
You're an animal, you hear me?

188
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,860
No, you're a disease

189
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,720
This is what you get you son of a bitch

190
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,120
This is what you get for being what you are

191
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,980
Die....Die

192
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,500
The hard part is over 
You're safe now

193
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,660
Anyway Mikasa alright? my name is Eren
I'm dr. Yaegar's son

194
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,700
I met your folks once or twice while I was with him

195
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,020
We were stopping by your house today for a checkup

196
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:03,940
We saw

197
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,640
What happened to the third one

198
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,320
This is all your doing, isn't it

199
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,300
Answer me you little bastard
You did this

200
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,140
I'm gonna kill you

201
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,620
You gonna die

202
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:32,880
Tak-

203
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,660
Take him out

204
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,040
Fight

205
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,500
Kill or be killed

206
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,360
Fight for your life

207
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,180
It's..it's the only way

208
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,500
Who the hell do you think you are you little brat

209
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,220
The only way to live

210
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,040
Is to fight

211
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,020
I can't
I don't think I can do this

212
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,460
And all of a sudden...I remembered

213
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,880
I'd seen it all before

214
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,340
Many...many times 

215
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,040
Since the day I was born

216
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,280
It'd been all around me, forever

217
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,400
But

218
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,840
I always look the other way

219
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,880
Yeah

220
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,260
The world is a cruel place

221
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,220
And it's home

222
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,800
All of a sudden my body wasn't shaking

223
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:58,700
I was in total control, focused, ready

224
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,540
All of a sudden I could do anything

225
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,780
Fight

226
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:09,940
Fight

227
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,300
Fight

228
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,720
Stabbed through the heart from behind

229
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,660
surely a couple of kids couldn't have done this

230
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,480
Damn it son, I made it clear 
I wanted you to wait at the foot of the mountain

231
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,480
Do you even understand the magnitude 
of what you've done here today

232
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,180
Sorry dad I'm not gonna feel bad for what happened

233
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,080
They were animals disguised as humans 
who needed to be put down

234
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,560
-Listen to yourself 
-By the time the military police got here

235
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,580
They'd have been long gone and you know it

236
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,700
We couldn't afford to wait

237
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,430
That's not what I'm arguing about 
you threw caution to the wind and survived by pure luck

238
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:04,900
You're strong, yes. but you're too damn young 
to be so casual about gambling with your life

239
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,520
I..I didn't know how I was supposed to save her

240
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,680
Mikasa, remember me?

241
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,920
We met a few times
before when you were just a tiny little thing

242
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,800
Yes dr. Yaegar

243
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,860
So umm.... sorry can you just tell me how to get home?

244
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,780
It's cold...I'm tired

245
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,220
There is really nowhere else for me to go

246
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,740
Don't worry you can keep it

247
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,820
That ought to keep you warm right?

248
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,220
I think so

249
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,500
Mikasa, how would you feel 
about coming to live with us?

250
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,380
What?

251
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,260
I can't even imagine what you've been through

252
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,720
But I do know you need your share of rest

253
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,720
What's the problem?
Don't think about it just come on

254
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,600
We gotta get home

255
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah Okay

256
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:55,320
The world's a cruel place 
if you want to live you have to fight

257
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,480
That's it we're done 
Now scale the wall

258
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,220
I should help the Vanguard withdraw, sir

259
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,740
Ackerman wait

260
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,280
It's a cruel world but by have a place in it

261
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:19,740
Eren as long as you're part of my life 
I can fight to the bitter end

262
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,360
It's a cruel world but by have a place in it

263
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:03,120
Mikasa races through hell to be besides 
the one person who make the struggle worth while

264
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,920
Only to learn just how deep hell goes
