1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,700
In the year 850, the Colossal Titan again appeared 
and decimated yet another barrier between us and them

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,940
Once more, mankind retreated in panic
before the advance of its greatest foe

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,300
Brave soul after brave soul perished, eaten alive

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,100
Eren, No!

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,800
Eren himself fell prey to their hunger

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,020
Wow Mikasa is a badass

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,040
How is she going so fast?

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,240
No, Mikasa is using too much gas

9
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,320
I'll do whatever it takes to win
whatever it takes to live

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,340
Just when things seem their darkest for Mikasa

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,180
Out of nowhere came the unlikeliest of allies

12
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,560
I Can Hear a Heartbeat

13
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,880
There, got it

14
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,100
The ODM gear is functional and I restocked your blades

15
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,400
Just...just leave me this one okay

16
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,120
It just...I would rather this be my end not
being eaten alive

17
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,140
Why did you?

18
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
Armin

19
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,260
I will not leave you behind

20
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,680
What?

21
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,400
I mean Titans are everywhere
you jump and carry me on your back

22
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
C'mon lets move

23
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,020
Please don't do this

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,060
Its not going to work

25
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,600
Enough people have died on my account

26
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,140
No

27
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,420
Hold on, I've got an idea

28
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,400
What is it then?

29
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,920
Only you two are capable of pulling this off
so it's really your choice

30
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,960
This may sound crazy, but I think he might
be useful

31
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,700
Wow you mean that Titan?

32
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,560
He only attacks his own kind
he seems to have no interest in us

33
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,560
What if we could somehow steer him to HQ
And let him loose on the other Titans

34
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,090
Look we know he's taking at least one than already

35
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,200
We can use him as a weapon

36
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,780
You've got to be kidding,
How the hell you think we supposed to steer that thing?

37
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,640
Something tells me he is fighting on instinct

38
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,600
I'm almost sure if you take down the bear
he is tangling with now, he will go look for others

39
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,160
That will lead him straight to HQ
we're not steering him so much as luring him

40
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,080
I think it'll work i really do

41
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,520
Think? you're asking us to risk our necks
on a stupid gut feeling?

42
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,000
If I'm right about this we can put down
the siege on Head Quarters in one fell swoop

43
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,840
It worth a shot

44
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,460
Huh?

45
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,960
seriously?

46
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,000
Better to a gambling on Armin's gut feeling
than wait around to get slaughtered

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,780
If there is a decent shot why not take it?

48
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,540
So basically we're gonna recruit a Titan

49
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,240
Yes, Exactly

50
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,980
We'll look like morons if we screw this up

51
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,200
Yeah but, if don't look how many live we'll stand to save

52
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,980
Where there is a will there is a way

53
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,340
It's still nuts but what the hell

54
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,240
Why couldn't I stop them?

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,600
I'm the last person that should've been given
the raids

56
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,040
No, No

57
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,240
This is our chance

58
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,780
We can get the drop on them while they're
occupied,

59
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,320
It's Perfect

60
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,060
Let's go

61
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,260
make a break for HQ
while they all are distracted

62
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,780
We can do this

63
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,200
Hey we run out of 
gas we're dead anyway

64
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,480
Give it everything you've got

65
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Jean

66
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,740
You really came through for us there man
we owe you big time

67
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,260
Don't knock it off I'm serious

68
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,740
We're alive because of you
like i said you make a great leader

69
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,160
Peace You with that crap we're not out of
this yet

70
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,820
Damn it

71
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240
How many of us made it?

72
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,300
How many biased to that crawl over?

73
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,840
How many of my comrades died on my order?

74
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Hold on a second

75
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,120
You guys with the supply team?

76
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,420
Yeah

77
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,380
Jean stop

78
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,680
You cowards you left us out there on our own

79
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,880
People are dead because you get never guts to do your job

80
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,160
The Titans were coming at us from every angle

81
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,340
They're here in our supply room okay

82
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,260
It's your job to deal with it and back us up anyway

83
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,120
Hid that back

84
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,080
Son of a-

85
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,780
There is too many people, they can smell us

86
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:33,860
Run

87
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,180
Get further in

88
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,240
Where is Mikasa? Have you seen her?

89
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,240
She ran out of gas forget about her she is dead

90
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,180
This is it

91
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,700
This is reality

92
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,320
Of course it is

93
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,660
How deluded was I?

94
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,320
No

95
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,120
No at some level i knew it all along

96
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,960
I mean when you stop and think for a second it's obvious

97
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,960
There is no winning

98
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,080
Not against them

99
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:15,860
What?

100
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,140
What the? my God

101
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,140
Mikasa you are?

102
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,960
Wow close one I was hurling on fumes
we made it here thought, crazy but we did

103
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,420
You- I..

104
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,560
Am I dreaming this or what?

105
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,160
You sir are genius from now on 
as far as I'm concerned your words is law

106
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,280
Check it out, we found an abnormal 
who's got a bone to pick with his own kind

107
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,120
And the best part 
he couldn't care less about us

108
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,240
That's right you heard me 
This big beautiful ass-hole beast is our ticket out of here

109
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,520
You mean like fighting fire with fire?
listen to yourself a Titan not gonna help us

110
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,400
You're out of your mind if you think this gonna work

111
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,540
It' is working

112
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,620
For whatever reason, he is rampaging against them
Stand back and let him do it, trust me you'll see

113
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,120
Either way what choice do we have

114
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,620
Right now that thing is our best chance of survival

115
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,520
Look at it go!

116
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,160
This kind makes the others look like total weaklings

117
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,600
They are not gonna take this building

118
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,220
Not with him at a rampage out there

119
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,140
That's all well and good
what's will keep him from turning on us once he's done?

120
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,920
Guess we'll worry about that when we're safe

121
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,380
Yeah you're right at least he is buying us a little time

122
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,160
Good news

123
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,360
Courtesy of the Military Police

124
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,460
And covered with a layer of dust

125
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,860
Are you absolutely sure buckshot is the way to go?

126
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,520
Seems like we might as well throw spit wads

127
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,020
I mean come on guys...are guns even effective?

128
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,500
I don't know but they bound to be better than nothing

129
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,740
We're looking at seven Titans 
in the supply room of the 4-meters tall variety

130
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,440
If we time this perfectly 
this much ammo ought to be enough to do the trick

131
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,860
STEP 1: We would lower a group into 
the area via a left to get the Titans attention

132
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,500
STEP 2: When the Titans come within range the group 
fires in all four directions simultaneously blinding them

133
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,680
Then the hard part, the moment of truth as at war

134
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:12,140
Before Titans have time to recover seven of us 
swoop down from the sealing and strike their vital regions

135
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,660
That's is
That's the plan

136
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,660
It puts all our lives on the line 
we screw up we're dead

137
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,680
That's a hell of a risk for one attack 
but it's our only chance

138
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,060
Seven people have to slay seven Titans
 in one blow at the same time

139
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,240
We gonna need the best of you the seven soldiers most 
physically gifted and adapted with their baring blades

140
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:40,080
You will be the difference between life and death 
for the rest of us, I'm sorry that's how it is

141
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,820
[Reiner]: Seem like a sound plan

142
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,600
[Annie]: When you gt right down to it 
the risk is the same for everyone

143
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,500
Doesn't really matter who goes

144
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,560
But guys I'm willing to be top doubt of it this
one half big strategy can't be our only option right?

145
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,280
[Marco]: Hey don't be so hard on yourself

146
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,380
Come on with what we are looking at 
cuz' for our only option, it's pretty well thought out

147
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,780
If we give it our all we might just pull this off

148
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,860
[Mikasa]: It'll be fine you just have to be confident

149
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,280
You're a better strategist than you give yourself credit for

150
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,040
Huh?

151
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,020
I'm serious that mind saved Eren and me more than once

152
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,540
When did I ever saved you? that's not-

153
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,720
Alright the left is ready to go guns are loaded 
to the stocks lets go kill some Titans

154
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,560
You didn't realize it at the time we can talk about it later

155
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,380
Okay I'm gonna ask the obvious question 
can we do this without ODM gear?

156
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,380
No Problem these guys are only 4 meters tall

157
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,780
Their weak spots are not too far above eye level

158
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:44,940
He is right size won't be an issue the spot still 
only 1 meter high and 10 centimeters across

159
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,660
Back at the head to the nape at the neck

160
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,940
Worse comes to worst you can always just shove 
one of these up their ass that's the other weak spot

161
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,480
Are you serious? that's news to me

162
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,940
Did I miss a day of training or something?

163
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:03,340
[Jean]: Come on knock it off Reiner 
you wants your final words to be an ass jokes?

164
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,460
[Marco]: Good we're still at seven

165
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,480
[Marco]: Okay now nice and easy

166
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,000
Don't lose your cool 
fire only when they are all within range

167
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,920
Steady

168
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,180
That's right....wait for it

169
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,700
Our lives are riding on this

170
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,160
Gotta make this attack count

171
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,380
Steady

172
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,020
Almost

173
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,620
Fire

174
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,300
Right, how are you guys?

175
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,480
[Sasha]: I...I'm sorry...I did it

176
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,240
[Connie]: Oh crap

177
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,540
I didn't mean to sneak up on you

178
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,100
Sasha and Connie missed

179
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,660
Need of the hell back

180
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,800
I...oh God

181
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,220
No...I said I'm sorry

182
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,000
Mikasa

183
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,460
You saved my life

184
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,220
Are you okay?

185
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,660
Because of you I am

186
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,400
Then get up

187
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,360
I owe you one

188
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,220
No worries

189
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,160
By the skin of your teeth

190
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,140
You damn lucky you didn't end up worse off

191
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,520
They are all dead

192
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,940
Start loading up supplies

193
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,180
It worked

194
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,360
We gonna make it...we gonna live

195
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,920
No more of them coming in

196
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,420
Thank you crazy berserker Titan

197
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,000
I gaved if went through whole again

198
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,840
I'm never gonna be able to face any of them again

199
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,260
Damn it feel sorry for yourself later focus on escape

200
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,760
[Jean]: Listen now what you said about me being 
a leader and all...don't talk about that again right

201
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,540
[Marco]: Promise me you're not gonna take this the wrong way

202
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,900
But I don't think you're a good reader cuz you're strong

203
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,860
I think you're a good leader 
cuz you know what it is to be weak

204
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,580
You're one of us you scared out of your mind 
just like we all are

205
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,160
It makes you alert sympathetic

206
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,240
You made a damn good call out there

207
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,380
Got me running for my life you're why i can say this

208
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,840
Ready people let's do this

209
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,100
Mikasa?

210
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,700
What're you doing we have to leave now

211
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,060
Look down there

212
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,380
Cannibalism?

213
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,880
And he is not regenerating like the others?

214
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,500
This may sound stupid 
but I was hoping he'd be the key for us

215
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,820
That he'd help mankind break the cycle

216
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,880
Turn the tide just long enough 
to give us a little ray of hope

217
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,360
[Reiner]: She is right he's too valuable to just let die
There is too much we can learn from it

218
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,520
I think it's perfectly clear our priority 
should be to wore the scavengers off

219
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,560
He is no good to us picked apart

220
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,820
[Jean]: Are you out of your mind we've got a bath 
out of this nightmare and you want us to stay?

221
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:37,020
[Annie]: Think about it having an abnormal 
as an Allie would be an incredible advantage right?

222
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,420
The cannons got nothing on a Titan 
who'd like to strip apart his own kind

223
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,120
You? do you hear yourself?
He is going like a new friend

224
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,960
Oh no

225
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,180
It's the one that ate Tomas

226
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,140
Holly!

227
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,980
What was that you were saying?

228
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,780
Cause I think it's a move point now

229
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,720
Alright enough of this lets leave while we can

230
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,600
We're lucky the ugly bastard didn't get bored
we'd have been the next on the menu

231
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,380
Look Titan is a Titan

232
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,880
Mikasa

233
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,960
It's him

234
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,680
Ah his arm !

235
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,740
It's like...I don't understand

236
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,200
I watched him getting eaten

237
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,340
I watched him die

238
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,140
He is so...

239
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,520
How is this...possible?

240
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,780
Okay, so all the...

241
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,800
Eren did all this?

242
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,580
The overwhelming desire for revenge

243
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,540
An emotion powerful enough to alter 
even our physical bodies

244
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,740
When he transforms he went 
to the very thing he despises however

245
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,680
You might just find a sort of your allies turned on you
