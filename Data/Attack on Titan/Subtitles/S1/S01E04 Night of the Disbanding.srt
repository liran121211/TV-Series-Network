00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,380
In the year 845,
Two terrifying new breeds of Titan appeared

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,260
The Colossal and the Armored

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,920
Barreling through the outer walls as if wholesale destruction was child's play

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,060
In blood and thunder our way of life ended

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,960
The Titans spent their hunger
for human flesh unchecked

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,240
The territory counted within the circle of wall Maria was abandoned

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,040
20% of the human race perished

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:38,120
As the Titan onslaught advanced our only choice
was to his draw behind Wall Rose

10
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,340
pick up the pace you led heeled laggards

11
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,040
Your boots waterlogged Arlert?
Let's see some hustle !

12
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,980
they're too heavy for you son?
Hell drop it leave it in them by

13
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:40,060
The Titans are easy if they were digesting you
without all the excess baggage

14
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:51,640
Seriously?..here focus on staying upright we are being graded on this you know

15
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,100
- Thank's but, won't they demerit you for helping me?
- Yeah if they find out

16
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,740
Just make the cut we're even alright?

17
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:10,080
Reiner Braun
The minded constitution of a grass-fed ox
Respected by his comrades

18
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,520
I'm no one's burden you hear me

19
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,900
Armin Arlert
Built like a daffodil but academically brilliant

20
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:51,220
Annie Leonhart
Gifted with a sword but does not exactly play well with others

21
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,320
Bertolt Hoover
Heaps of native talent but to mild-mannered

22
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:05,540
Jean Kirschtein
Head of the class on ODM also
An insufferable smart-ass with a hair-trigger temper

23
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,300
Think they'll show off some slice and dice
best hope you see a Titan before I do

24
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,340
Military Police, save a place for Jean

25
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,240
Why to leave the charge

26
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,040
You don't care if steal your thunder, right?

27
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,920
Sasha Blouse
Unusually find Instinct
Rarely shares them with her teammates

28
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,440
Connie Springer
Agile on the switchbacks
Few sandwiches shy of a picnic

29
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,280
Get ready

30
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,060
Damn it, still not  deep enough

31
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,620
Mikasa Ackerman
Model cadet, excels in everything

32
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,080
In fact it's no overstatement to call the girl a genius

33
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,300
Eren Yeager
Lackluster in the classroom marginally better in the field

34
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,420
But driven by a sense of purpose that's almost terrifying

35
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,540
Sorry man, I've really gotta learn to hold back

36
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,540
It's alright let's see how you do as a rogue

37
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,720
- What are you waiting on ?
- This training doesn't make sense

38
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,020
We're not exactly picking fights
with someone around our size

39
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,400
A guy have to be stupid to use this, I mean a knife

40
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,860
What if there's not an option
The fight doesn't give us a say

41
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,320
If it wants to get ugly it gets ugly
it's our job to be prepared

42
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,880
The enemy comes in many forms
artillery is not always gonna be the answer

43
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:21,400
Soldiers the ones worth their self anyway
Are ready for anything

44
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,900
Don't believe me? look
Yeah what about her

45
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,640
Only things she's ready for is any chance to slack off

46
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,120
You think so?
maybe somebody ought to give her a talking to-

47
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,840
-to give her a little hard knocks lesson
in preparedness

48
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,720
Common doubt not beating you down enough?

49
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,660
Keep it up you'll be as
flat as the dirt you're walking on

50
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,940
I suggest you think back to
why you enlisted in the first place

51
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,180
What are you doing?

52
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,920
Wow she's pissed
Wow I thought she looked scary before

53
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,580
He couldn't pay me enough to be on her bad side

54
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,880
-Okay, now go get her
-Huh, What the hell wait!

55
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,300
Right, I hope you don't expect me to hold back

56
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,800
Heads up!

57
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,380
AH! son of a-
That was a dirty move

58
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,140
Are we done here?

59
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,040
Not just yet, you know the drill
take up the dagger

60
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,560
No, wait!
This isn't help- oh CRAP

61
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,700
There

62
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,820
So you're ready to take me on yourself yet or what?

63
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,720
-Ah! Not exactly
-don't you dare

64
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,420
She's got a lesson coming right? you go get her

65
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,120
Yeah, a soldier can't really afford to back-down either

66
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,380
Get ready here I com-

67
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,780
That's some technique you've got
Who taught you to fight like that?

68
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,740
My father did
He like pioneer or -

69
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,600
Does it really matter

70
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,480
It's pointless just like all this
Wait you mean the training in general?

71
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,200
Hand-to-hand combat doesn't really count
against our final grade

72
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,320
The smart ones blow it off

73
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,760
It's a crapshoot anyway only the top ten cadets
get to serve in the interior the rest of us? forget it

74
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,500
Point is only the idiots like you take
this part of bootcamp seriously

75
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,180
Idiots, whatever they are

76
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,380
First rule of this life kid
The better you are at dropping the bad guys

77
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,500
The more distance the powers-that-be put
between you

78
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,880
That's what this whole stupid farce is about
sure whatever you say

79
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,240
Face it, you don't fight the nature of things and win

80
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:28,120
Look around you Eren, all the sons of bitches
really expect us to do is play the game

81
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,360
Don't be a pawn

82
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,580
Yeah well I still stand by what I said earlier

83
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,440
I've been so fixated on building myself up I couldn't see it
She's absolutely right

84
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,540
They're not honing their skills to fight,
They're honing their skill to run

85
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:00,180
I know okay and look I'm not saying it's right it's just the way things are

86
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,620
Before wall Maria was compromised
ODM experts were rare

87
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,560
only Scouts ever risk proximity to the Titans

88
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,850
(That's how you conserve fuel let your momentum do the work for you)

89
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,250
Still that's pretty advanced
duh it's called having a sixth sense

90
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:20,640
For the finer points of your gear
You gotta do the strut if you want to make the cut

91
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,520
The MP only recruit the best
man that'd be amazing

92
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,480
Working within a stone's throw the king
No greater honor than that

93
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,880
Shut up Marco

94
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,540
We're not children you can drop the misty-eyed BS!
Honor doesn't have any damn part of it

95
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:43,200
You just want a nice cushy job in the interior playing glorified century
-That's not true That's not me at all

96
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,740
Listen to you guys

97
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,480
Interior five years ago this was part of it

98
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,960
you're gotta point to make friend? I'm right here

99
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,360
Poor Jean so misguided and besides

100
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,320
I don't think your head will fit in the interior anyway

101
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,180
Very funny seems a little backwards to me

102
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,880
Fine tuning your Titan killing skills so they Brass station you somewhere you'll never see one

103
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,220
you'd rather I was good at getting
killed thank you but I'll pass

104
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,940
-better to play the system than getting nod off
-Oh you son of a bitch

105
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,760
bring it on you little bastard

106
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,880
Eren please stop it

107
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,660
Gentlemen, please

108
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,420
You think you can Judge me?

109
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,240
-You ripped my shirt you damn
-I don't give a damn about your shirt you pissed me off

110
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,060
What are you crazy

111
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,300
oh wait I get it

112
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,570
He has something to prove sounds familiar

113
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,460
Sorry to do this

114
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,880
It's only to end this before things get out the hand

115
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,820
Damn it

116
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,880
What the hell was that move ?

117
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:18,240
Little something I picked up this afternoon
while you were busy with your thumb up your ass

118
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,900
You honestly believe the military police
are your ticket to the good life

119
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,580
You're not a soldier you're a joke

120
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,020
Would someone care to explain
the little ruckus I'd heard just now

121
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,240
I do hope everything's all right

122
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,900
-Sasha passed some gas commandant
-Why am I not surprised

123
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,800
For the love God learn some self-control

124
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:11,360
Of the original recruits
218 cadets graduated some with honors

125
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,220
Do you have heart
Sir!

126
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,660
As of this moment you have three options open to you

127
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,740
Choose wisely

128
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,820
The garrison regiment
Whose job is to reinforce the walls

129
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,880
The Scout regiment
Who rides out in a Titan's country to take back
what was once ours

130
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,160
And the MP regiment
Maintaining law and order under orders
from His Royal Majesty

131
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,220
Those cadets eligible for the MP
have already been named

132
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,480
The rest of you take a look
these are the top of your class

133
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,760
This is it we've made it

134
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,480
Our time is now

135
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,840
Titans be reay

136
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,340
Alright MP here I come
three square meals a day for life

137
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,280
How in God's name did I get ranked under Eren

138
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,860
You're really gonna turn your back on the MP
for the scouts?

139
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,840
Why in the world would you do that
you're in the top ten

140
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,360
the scouts have always been my goal
I don't want the easy life

141
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,280
not with all the work I've put in
I trained to fight Titans

142
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,660
Are you insane

143
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,100
How many people have died
we're talking a fifth of the population

144
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,000
If that doesn't paint a picture for you
I don't know what will

145
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,960
This is our life now we, can't beat them

146
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,720
Yeah so what we buckle take it all line down

147
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,380
Things have changed
maybe not a hell of a lot but enough

148
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,660
They aren't the mystery they were five years ago

149
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:22,900
There's still a long way to go but we've made progress
Every battle we lost taught us a lesson

150
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,580
Gave us the tiniest in road towards something like hope

151
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:30,220
You telling me it's better to cut our losses let all the death and destruction be meaningless

152
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,140
Just to ball it up and accept it not on your life

153
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,640
humanity's future lies outside the walls
and I'm gonna clear the way

154
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,640
I'm gonna take back what was ours
I'll Drive them out

155
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:48,320
And as long as at least one of us can say that
we're not done

156
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,240
Eren wait

157
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,440
Yeah good luck out there hotshot
I'll root free from his Majesty's barracks

158
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,980
-That was quite a speech you gave us there
-Yeah most of it was yours well

159
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,460
All that stuff you used to say back in the day

160
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,760
Yeah well I'm joining the Scout regiment too

161
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,860
Now you're just being stupid
come on you're not a fighter

162
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,040
-Your life is with books
-I'm through with letting other people fight for me

163
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,920
Guess it's the scouts for me too then

164
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,040
Oh come on you're top of the class
you'll be wasting your shot

165
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,840
Understand this Eren where you go I go

166
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,420
I made a promise to your mom before she died
I'm not letting you die

167
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,460
I've got your back whether you like it or not
so just deal with it

168
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,780
Yeah well mom's not here

169
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,720
A lot of people I used to care about aren't here either

170
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,910
Heads up the main unit of the Scout regiment is back

171
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,900
That's right commander Erwin
did you get those ugly bastards a thrashing?

172
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:40,040
Look it's captain Levi
They say he's like an entire brigade himself

173
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,660
-Spare me please
-Feel how excited everybody is?

174
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,120
It's like the crowd just has a different energy now

175
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,340
Well we are going on five years without incident
seems like a good omen

176
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,240
And you should check out all the cannon upgrades
the sight alone ought to be enough to scare them off

177
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,360
That's the truth
human denial cuz' you're a couple what's that about

178
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,780
Whow whow, this isn't what it's looks like okay

179
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,420
Knock it off man it's embarrassing

180
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
[Hannes]: Hey hey lookie here

181
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,280
[Eren]: Mr.Hannes

182
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,760
Word on the streets they let you graduate yesterday

183
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,160
Either you've grown up for a standards of plummeted

184
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,700
Oh yeah like you're one to talk the Corps
of engineers keep their new chief in the drink

185
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,940
Watch it

186
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,480
I'm sorry if this is out of the blue
but I want you to know your mom's death still haunts me

187
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,820
Me too but it wasn't your fault

188
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,020
We were shooting in the dark then
but nothing like that's gonna happen again

189
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,940
We know what we're dealing with now

190
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:54,460
Fred up and capable make a good combination kid
Don't screw it up by dying

191
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,260
What the hell you mean you're joining the scouts

192
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,300
-What happened to the MP that was your whole thing
-Don't worry about it

193
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,900
-The guy is allowed to change his mind, okay
-I think your speech yesterday lit a fire under him

194
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,140
Ain't nobody talking to you
his temper tantrum had nothing to do with it

195
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,340
Take it easy it's not like you're the only one

196
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,700
Why are you serious

197
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,900
Can you guys keep a secret cuz' i totally
just helped myself to the officers pantry

198
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,320
Sasha they can throw your butt in the clink for that

199
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,420
-Seriously what is wrong with you
-What isn't wrong with her

200
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,160
it'll be fine I'm willing to share

201
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,260
Put it back

202
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,600
Do you have any idea how rare meats been
since the Titans took wall Maria

203
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,220
Um a little bit yeah

204
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:58,920
Just look at it this way pretty soon
we'll take back all the room we need for livestock

205
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,260
-I would really like a slice please
-Hey if he gets one so do I just so you know

206
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,060
-Me too
-I'm in on it too

207
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,850
-But?
-Come on don't just stand there

208
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,900
If they see us slacking off, we're in for it

209
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,760
See you guys at lunch time

210
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:32,000
Has it really been five years
look at us ready to stand tall again

211
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,460
We can do it

212
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,180
Mankind didn't start this fight
but we are gonna finish it

213
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,140
Ah, It's Hot

214
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,780
Samuel!

215
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,840
Sasha!

216
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,720
Try not to move, understand

217
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,940
That was too damn close

218
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,500
Oh God no not again

219
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,400
They are gonna get in!

220
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,600
They are gonna get in!

221
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,480
They are gonna get in!

222
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,640
No, this is over

223
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,580
I'm gonna put a stop to this

224
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,320
I will

225
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,240
This ends now

226
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,940
This is it people

227
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,660
Do or Die

228
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,620
Mount to cannons squad four

229
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,220
Take out the Colossal Titan

230
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,120
This is our chance

231
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,680
Don't let it slip away

232
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,900
You, it's been a while

233
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:01,440
The jaws of hell re-open
before you can even catch your breath

234
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,680
your between its teeth

235
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:10,020
sometimes saving the people dearest to you
means making the ultimate sacrifice
