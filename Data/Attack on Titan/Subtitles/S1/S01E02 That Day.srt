1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,040
They first appeared over a hundred years
ago

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,500
Giant humanoid creatures with a tease for our blood

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,120
The brute strength of these separations 
trumped an average person's many times over

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,760
We were shoved to the brink of extinction 
Almost overnight

5
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,180
The survivors erected walls 
Maria, Rose and Sina

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,920
Withdrawing behind them and frightened Huddle's

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,100
For what was to be a century of uneasy peace

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,560
And then

9
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,940
Till then a man apart from god

10
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,660
All wretched was i

11
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,500
having graven in us are powered by avarice

12
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,980
now that I'll beholdest

13
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,260
Am I here punished for it?

14
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,560
Punished by the justice of god

15
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,140
taint

16
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,300
Upon the penat of there rising souls

17
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,840
The mountain holds no greater pain

18
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,000
As greed has grown all of every corner

19
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,320
Every right so justice here doth chain

20
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,720
What else may have any grace doth our sins as us

21
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,160
For when did not our aim to hide between and like th-

22
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,800
[Hannes]: Damn it! stop

23
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,880
[Eren]: You son of a bitch we could've saved her

24
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,960
We almost had her out

25
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,820
Why did you come? why?

26
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,020
I told you to stop

27
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,880
[Mikasa]: Eren!

28
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,740
[Hannes]: Look

29
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,500
There's nothing you could have done
for her you understand?

30
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,780
you're a kid you're weak

31
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,520
I'm worse

32
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,560
when push came to shove

33
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,120
I was too frightened to hold my ground

34
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,980
your mother died 
because I'm a damn coward

35
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,720
I'm sorry

36
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,060
[Mikasa]: That's the same thing all over again

37
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,820
Hurry up! keep your eyes at the gate

38
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,200
Drop everything

39
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,400
find the ferry nearest  to you 
and climb aboard for all you worth

40
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,680
Move it 
These saints aren't gonna give you a head start

41
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,280
so-called outlier districts like Shiganshina
 shut out like thorns

42
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,040
At vital spots along wall Maria

43
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,360
Their basic function is to streamline troop dispersal

44
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,680
And keep security costs down
by drawing Titans into specific areas

45
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,520
The calculated design flaw in all outlier districts

46
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,500
Is that they have only a single gate 
through which its citizens

47
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,440
Are able to retreat deeper inward 
should the need arise

48
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,640
No personal belongings we need to make 
as much room as possible oh you best

49
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,900
Armin you best have a seat

50
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,060
I will just keeping an eye out 
for my friends

51
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,420
There they are

52
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,260
Eren

53
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,640
I wouldn't try to call out just now

54
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,220
Give them their space
god only knows what they've just seen

55
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,100
Stop dragging you feet

56
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,940
Snap out of it, I need those canons loaded

57
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,700
C'mon they're heading right for us

58
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,180
This isn't real! this is a nightmare

59
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,060
God help us

60
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,020
Hey, what're you doing?

61
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,940
I'm sorry it's at full capacity

62
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,320
You can't do this, please 
At least  let our children on board

63
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,540
Look, there is nothing we can do

64
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,520
Push off now

65
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,740
Don't leave us

66
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,020
There is still room

67
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,440
What are you aiming at?
Did you got crushed in your head?

68
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,560
Sir with respect

69
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,580
Through all this aim are not designed 
for accuracy, to begin with

70
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,780
You gonna give me attitude 
or you gonna reload?

71
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,680
Stop whining and do your job

72
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,020
What is the point

73
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,900
No! the inner gate

74
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,840
I am not getting left behind

75
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,580
wait are you out of your mind

76
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,640
Don't shut it yet we've still got people 
out there give them a chance

77
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,790
We can't let the titans get through the inner gate

78
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,940
If that happens the handful of lies out
there will be the least of our problems

79
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,986
There aren't enough resources for the
whole human race

80
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:33,060
To retreat behind the next wall they break through

81
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:33,958
Listen to  yourself

82
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,140
We're soldiers we don't get to decide who lives or dies

83
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,320
What are you waiting for?
The Titans are closing the gap that

84
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,900
That doesn't
Bring her down

85
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,020
No

86
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,360
Let go of me

87
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,680
What the hell !

88
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,540
Oh No!

89
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,620
Hurry

90
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,980
Impossible

91
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,460
We've got to get the hell out of here

92
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,720
Retreat

93
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,760
Shut the gate Now!

94
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,800
We're being charged

95
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,540
Help!

96
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh God

97
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,660
Bad news travels fast hours after Shiganshina fell

98
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,800
Every man woman and child within the interior 
knew the unthinkable had come to pass

99
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,240
Terror spread like wildfire

100
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,560
What do you think we're meant to make of these reports of Shiganshina falling to the Titans

101
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,620
Are they verified that?

102
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,520
That outcropping is held for a century 
it makes no sense

103
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,900
Whether or not they're verified

104
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,760
The refugees are certainly 
flooding in like plague rats

105
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,480
There have been at least five hundred 
accounted for in the boats

106
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,900
The question is 
How prepared are we if Shiganshina is in ruins ?

107
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,500
Come now surely while Maria is enough
on its own to hold the Titans at bay

108
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,660
Don't you think ?

109
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,420
Damn it all!

110
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,920
Anyway it's a slice the situation is untenable

111
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,900
Our hands are tied, I say we make Appeals 
To the central government for help

112
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,080
excuse me my Lords you really want to
hear this

113
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,980
Wall Maria has been broken through 
The Titans are.... they're in

114
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,600
This is the end

115
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,820
That's it we are all dead
We are dead and standing in the gate of hell

116
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,580
It's gone

117
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,520
Our house, it's all gone

118
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,420
Forever

119
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,920
Forever

120
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,880
Why was i always such a brat 
Why did I always fight her

121
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,920
I never said "I love you"

122
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,240
Now I will never get to

123
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,860
Never

124
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,420
There's nothing you could have done for her
you understand ?

125
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,573
Because I'm a kid, because I'm weak

126
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,200
Because every last one of us is a damn coward

127
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,600
No, this isn't over

128
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,880
[Mikasa]: What are you?
[Armin]: Whats wrong? you see something?

129
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,520
Eren?

130
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,740
I'm gonna put a stop to this

131
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,360
I'll kill them all

132
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,420
Every last one

133
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,680
Eren?

134
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,580
In terrified haste the central government 
declared the outlier districts a lost cause

135
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,860
And decreed all mankind retreat behind wall Rose

136
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,020
Estimates held that nearly 10,000 lives
were lost to the titan offensive

137
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,680
[Grisha Yeager]: Eren, Carla, Mikasa

138
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,800
Please be alive

139
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,580
Eren

140
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,980
Stay with me boy, wake up

141
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,360
[Eren]: Stop it, please you're scaring me

142
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,740
I dont understand what are you trying to do

143
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,260
[Grisha]: You don't have to, just give me your arm
[Eren] : No

144
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,280
You're insane, mom's death pushed you off the deep end

145
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,600
[Grisha]: Shut up

146
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,280
[Eren]: No, let me go

147
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,060
[Grisha]: Damn you, this is the only way

148
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,580
[Eren] : You're not making any sense

149
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,800
[Grisha]: You cannot forget the key, 
whatever you do you must reach it

150
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,780
It's the way to the truth

151
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,980
One day you'll understand

152
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,340
[Mikasa]: Hey it's okey, you were just dreaming

153
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,700
[Eren]: That was, it felt so real

154
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,180
[Mikasa]: Nightmare shake it off

155
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,460
[Eren]: Yeah

156
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,260
[Mikasa]: come on they're handing out 
food rations near the warehouse

157
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,520
I think this used to be 
where they stored all the dry goods now

158
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,140
Now it's where they Corral the refugees

159
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,940
I don't think so Friend

160
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,360
give me a break the all I've have for two days 
is a molded bread across

161
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,760
How do we exactly a dignified existence

162
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,560
[Armin]: Hey guys

163
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,560
[Eren]: Armin?

164
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,840
I'm glad I caught you

165
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,560
Here grandpa scrambled the little extra 
by telling the garrison he had guests

166
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,740
That was nice of him

167
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,660
what's his deal

168
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,180
just ignore it there's a shortage 
poor man's probably hungry

169
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,940
By the way I'd make that last 
they were already dealing with famine

170
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,100
Before we got here so it's an ugly situation

171
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,560
That and this far in there's a greater
disparity between the haves and the have-nots

172
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,160
Nothing more gratifying than 
senior rations go to animals

173
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,660
Guess we got a beef up the herd though

174
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,140
eat up the titans like a little meat on their bones

175
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,060
Eren wait

176
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,100
Ought to keep you in cages 
should be out to the front lines as a buffer

177
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,000
damn it you picked the wrong man asshole

178
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,572
Spineless cowards all of you

179
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,200
you don't, know what it's like

180
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,460
You've seen one?

181
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,940
You've seen what they can do?

182
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,540
You little piece of -

183
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,220
He's sorry he didn't mean it

184
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,140
He's just hungry

185
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,180
We all get that ways speak
our minds out of turn sometimes

186
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,420
forgive him I beg you

187
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,080
yeah well keep in mind it's given up
their share so you can eat

188
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,820
in case you hadn't noticed we're all hungry

189
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,080
tell your buddy a little gratitude goes a long way

190
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,100
Sure

191
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,700
Bastard I'm not a prat 
to show gratitude to a coward

192
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,360
I can't do this 
I'm going back to wall Maria

193
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,380
The Titans have to pay 
for what they've done to us

194
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,440
Hey now you're not serious 
that's your stomach talking

195
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,740
No it's not

196
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,280
Wake up the guys 
standing between us and them

197
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:46,880
Are just a bunch of talk

198
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,920
The hell with all of them 
Here, give it back

199
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,840
Yeah what are you trying to do starve?

200
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,180
When are you gonna get sick of
their charity too much is handed to us

201
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,200
We have to stand on her own two feet

202
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,450
To do what? get killed by a Titan ?

203
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,200
I know I used to think our future 
was beyond the walls

204
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,700
But it's like you told that man

205
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,476
I never seen what they could do to us

206
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,660
So that's it this is just the way life is

207
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,520
Run away and take what we were giving

208
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,560
Look at us, what choice do we have here? 
you can damn well leave

209
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,900
If you want to scrape by on the charity
of cowards that's your thing

210
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,380
but I'm not a parasite

211
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,600
Mikasa?

212
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,780
Have you looked in the mirror lately?
All of us are parasites

213
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,960
We couldn't run from certain death without help

214
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,280
Tell me differently

215
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,276
Don't take your shortcomings out on him

216
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,260
For God's sake we can't even find food on our own

217
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,840
we're parasites we're cowards

218
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,780
Titans are at the top 
of the food chain period

219
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,500
Pride be damned 
we do what we must to live

220
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,920
Your mom didn't ask us to be brave

221
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,500
Mikasa?

222
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,500
Eat it she asked us to stay alive 
I'm not about to let her down

223
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,860
A few days later

224
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,780
Throngs of starved refugees

225
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:33,240
Were put to plow in the wastelands 
as a last-ditch effort to raise food

226
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,840
But the cold hard ground yielded nothing

227
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,780
And the following year 846 
the remaining refugees old enough

228
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,260
To serve in the military 
were tasked with reclaiming wall Maria

229
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,940
Of the 250,000 sent
nearly 20% of the surviving population

230
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,140
Not even 200 made it back

231
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,180
While it did nothing to drive back to Titans

232
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,920
Their sacrifice did at least lessen 
the effects of famine within the interior

233
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,140
We have to find a way to stop them

234
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,440
Our lives will never be our own until we do

235
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,920
This world will never feel like home

236
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,940
That's it

237
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,820
Next year I'll be applying to join the cadets

238
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,280
To become strong enough to fight back

239
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,320
I'm with you

240
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,240
You don't have to

241
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,260
I do

242
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,140
So do I

243
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,060
Dammit not trying to drag you in 
look there's no point in following me to my death

244
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,020
Yeah, and if I can help it 
then it won't be your death

245
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,460
All right, together then

246
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:28,520
Straight those spines pissheads 104 
cadet corp boot camp starts now

247
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,640
Allow me to introduce myself
I'm commandant Keith Sardis

248
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,780
And you will gonna hate me

249
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,520
Training is gonna be a white-knuckle 
ride through hell

250
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,780
If I've done my job you'll be waking up 
in a cold sweat from memories of this place

251
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,680
Every night for the rest of your miserable lives

252
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,240
Right now you're nothing, livestock 
But over the next three soul-crushing years

253
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,700
you'll learn to take down your own Goliath

254
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,160
remember this moment 
when you come face-to-face with him

255
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,800
Because here's where you ask yourself

256
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,820
Am I a fighter? Or am I feed?

257
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,700
Am I gonna be ground up to pulpy 
human grist between both of sides it's incisors?

258
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,200
Or am I gonna be the one to bite?

259
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,220
Oh I'm a fighter alright, 
and before I'm done with them

260
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,000
The Titans will grow to hate me

261
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:50,660
see

262
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:52,730
you

263
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:02,390
it isn't easy hard truth passions no
guarantee he'll stick the landing

264
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:07,320
unless you can transmute it into skill
when you're floored by fundamentals all

265
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,940
the heart in the world means nothing
