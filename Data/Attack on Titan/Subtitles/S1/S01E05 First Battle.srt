1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,100
In the year 845, 
two terrifying new breeds of Titans appeared

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,460
The Colossal and Armored

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,740
Barreling through the outer walls 
as if wholesale destruction was child's play

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,900
The territory couched within the circle
of wall Maria was abandoned

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,840
Twenty percent of the human race
perished

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,020
As the Titan onslaught advanced our only choice 
was to his draw behind Wall Rose

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,060
Five years later in the year 850

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,900
[Eren]: Mankind didn't start this fight 
but we're gonna finish it

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,320
Mount to cannons squad four

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,800
Take out the Colossal Titan

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,960
This is our chance

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,820
Don't let it slip away

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,560
You

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,840
It's been a while

15
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,580
Son of a bitch !

16
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,960
He took out the cannons

17
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,600
the gate was no accident then

18
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,000
He! he planned it

19
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,040
He has intelligence!

20
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,560
All the more reason not to waste this moment,
without him the other Titans have nothing

21
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,860
I'm gonna take him down

22
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,100
Damn it!

23
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,940
Take this

24
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,020
How did I miss

25
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,820
What the -

26
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,540
Did he just vanish in the thin air?

27
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,220
Eren where did he go ?
Did he get away or did you take him out ?

28
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,880
He's gone exactly like five years ago

29
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,380
He's here one moment and gone the next
Just like that

30
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,280
I'm sorry

31
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,580
Don't apologize, look at us we were too scared to move

32
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,120
Hey wallow on your own time

33
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,580
In case you hadn't noticed there's a breach 
we have to act now if they start pouring in that's it

34
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:36,640
Look alive operation Colossal Titan response is in effect 
I expect you to take part report to HQ

35
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:44,420
If you got close to the damn thing we need details, Sir
sir we pray the advance team will be victorious

36
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,660
Here down, take only what you need to survive

37
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,960
You understand what we're facing 
If they get through we'll have a repeat of five years ago

38
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,820
Consider this the last line of defense

39
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,120
The Titans get held up here or nowhere

40
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,040
Prepare to intercept

41
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:23,900
Fire

42
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,340
SOLDIERS CHARGE

43
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,740
Out of the frying pan and into the fire cadets 
Time to put your training to work

44
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,340
I have faith each of you will be a credit to your regimen

45
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,600
I promise we'll get through this

46
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,660
You're safe as long as I'm aside you

47
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,260
Franz...

48
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,280
Armin, what's wrong?

49
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,460
I... don't worry I'm fine

50
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,740
Just give me a second for my nerves to settle 
this is bad isn't it

51
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,060
There's a hole in the wall eight meters wide and we don't 
even remotely have the engineering know how to plug it

52
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:12,940
That huge boulder near the front gate was our best bet 
but we couldn't figure out how to host it in place

53
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,560
Unless we seal the breach 
the entire city isn't gonna stand

54
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,720
How long do you think before they take wall Rose? 
Seriously, how long ?

55
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,340
Think about it, anytime the mood 
strikes them taking one belt

56
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,820
-The human race in an afternoon 
-Armin, listen to me

57
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:41,580
You're focused on the past look ahead
We're not gonna be the victims anymore

58
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,820
Sorry I...I'm okay

59
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,460
Come now take this seriously

60
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,500
Very well yet another victory is mine

61
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,900
Dear oh dear, 
One would think our monthly rose would see at least

62
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,440
Some modest improvement 
in your approach to the game Pyxis

63
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,380
One would think so yes clearly 
my brain is inferior to yours Lord Falls

64
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,320
Such obsequiousness from the single 
highest-ranking officer in the southern territory

65
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:44,780
Tell me seriously how can you hope to thwart 
(Commander Pyxis sir I bring news)

66
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:50,120
I beg your pardon young man this is-
(The Colossal Titan has laid siege to the city of Trost)

67
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,220
Reports say the gate has been destroyed

68
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,600
Ah this vintage is worthy of your good taste

69
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,060
One man of action to another
I obsequiously accept it as a gift

70
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,000
Where you going Pyxis wait

71
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,940
You can't just march off i command you to stay
Preparations must be made

72
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,400
The symbol of your troop said establish a garrison
around my estate this instant

73
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,640
Damn it all it's your sworn duty to defend us

74
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,220
Lord Walt sir!

75
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,140
Untold numbers of our brave comrades and
arms are laying down their lives

76
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,320
-In defense of trust as we speak 
-Commander, I'll go ready the horses sir

77
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,400
When the dust is settled there may well be more graves than people to dig them

78
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,065
-An astronomical number of lives 
snuffed out in a twinkling

79
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:59,320
Yes, well no help for it is there if it's their time
besides what earthly good can the presence of a man

80
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,220
Who persistently loses to me at chess do
for them now why not remain where I can assist you

81
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,400
Your lordship if I may speak freely
Should the commander actually face a Titan in battle

82
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,900
He won't feel compelled to play down his skill 
As he does with you

83
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,460
That's enough soldier

84
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:24,000
Good day sir, I wish you another
opulently appointed day of sloth and tranquility

85
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:32,600
Please don't go, don't do this to me
Pixis please I'm begging you

86
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,780
Pixis!

87
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,120
I want everyone split into four squadrons as practice

88
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,840
All squadrons are responsible for supply running, message relay and enemy combat

89
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,900
Under the command of the garrison regiment 
the intercept squadron will be taking the Vanguard

90
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,280
Cadets will be taking the middle guard
led by the support squad

91
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,320
Rearguard will go to the elite

92
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,760
I expect you all to man your posts 
knowing the advance team has been wiped out

93
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,420
That's right the other gate is  history the Titans are in

94
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,180
This means the Armored Titan is likely to reappear

95
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,640
If and when he does the inner gate 
will also be history

96
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,700
-Is this real ?
-At least be a dream !

97
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,080
God !, what if the bastions managed 
to bust through wall Rose

98
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,440
QUIET!

99
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,260
Right those are the vanguard be ready

100
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:41,300
The whole areas as well not saturated 
your mission is a very simple one

101
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,320
Defend the wall for the evacuation is done

102
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,340
Now be aware all of you 
that desertion is punishable by execution

103
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,120
If becomes to it lay down your lives

104
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
dismissed

105
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,000
SIR!

106
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,480
Why did this have to happen now?

107
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,840
Just one more day and I'd have been 
heading to the interior

108
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,600
[Christa]: You gonna be alright

109
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,740
Please No! Please No! Please No!

110
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,180
Move it

111
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,240
What the hell man? what's wrong with you?

112
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,100
What kind of question is that?
 we're all about to be Titan's shit

113
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,240
And you expect me to sing you a happy little solemn

114
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,760
you're loving this aren't you?
you little psycho

115
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,433
Of course you are your whole 
life's aspiration is to be eaten

116
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,580
I was one day shy of shipping off to the MP

117
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:47,620
-Jean get a hold 
-No, not all of us are suicidal 
-Damn it ! shut up for a second

118
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,320
We're trained for this
what do you think the last three years were about?

119
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,340
We survived we stared death in the face 
and we lived, not everyone can say that can they?

120
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,540
Some people couldn't take it 
and either ran or were thrown out

121
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,440
Hell some people actually died, but not us

122
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,580
Am i right? we powered through for three years 
what's one more day

123
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:15,040
you can do this Jean alright, 
the MP will still be waiting for you tomorrow

124
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,380
Shit

125
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,620
On your feet Daz stop bawling

126
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,260
Okay

127
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:32,340
Eren if things take a turn for the worse
I want you to come find me alright?

128
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,100
What we're in completely different squads

129
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,000
Look this is gonna get ugly and when it does
the plan goes out the window

130
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,920
Come and find me so I can protect you

131
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,800
who the hell do you think you are you're?
(Ackerman)

132
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:47,240
You're with me you've been assigned at the rearguard 
on special orders let's get moving

133
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,160
But Sir I'm a cadet
I'll slow everyone down (what)

134
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,300
You're not being asked for a self-evaluation here
The mass exodus is falling apart

135
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,920
We need as many elite soldiers as possible to
get things back on track

136
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,640
Sir, with all due resp-

137
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,300
HEY!

138
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,920
You've been given a direct order 
pull it together, Now!

139
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,625
This is bigger than the two of us and you know it

140
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:12,400
We're on the verge extinction here 
have some damn perspective

141
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,380
You're right I'm sorry 
this whole situation just has me out of my head

142
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,800
Just promise! 
Promise me one thing

143
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,840
Whatever happens don't get yourself killed

144
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:44,000
I had planned on it, thanks 
NO! I won't allow myself to get killed

145
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,900
Not until I taste what life is like outside 
of these godforsaken walls

146
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,440
But surviving historical documents we have access to
tell us nothing of the Tigers origin

147
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,540
Almost everything about them is obscure
now that isn't to suggest

148
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,660
We're completely ignorant thanks to the
efforts of the Scout regiment

149
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,960
We do know something of their ecology

150
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,680
Whether Titans possess human-like intelligence 
is up for debate of course

151
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,120
And today there have been no reports 
of high-level communication between them

152
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,460
We do know that Titan physiology is fundamentally different than most organic life

153
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,000
As they lack reproductive organs it's unclear how they reproduce

154
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,560
Apart from this to all appearances their physique 
resembles the average human male

155
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,040
We also know their body temperatures run quite high

156
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,600
And baffling though it is their appetite
seems geared exclusively towards human beings

157
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,820
In fact a Titan striding principle 
seems to be this appetite

158
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:51,080
Given that they've subsisted for over a century without 
Access to their only source of nourishment however

159
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,160
We surmise that these creatures 
do not in fact consume us to live

160
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:01,980
Let that sink in, Titans aren't motivated 
by hunger as such they're simply in it for the kill

161
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,800
But terrifying vitality of these
creatures is beyond scientific dispute

162
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,460
We have only to consider events 
of the recent past to see this

163
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,900
Mankind has long possessed canon technology as you're aware

164
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,320
but that alone proved tragically insufficient

165
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,880
Even with their heads blown to bits 
the Titans persist

166
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,920
Though there is some variability on this score 
a Titan's head usually regenerates within two minutes

167
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,720
(Is that true?)(As it their size wasn't frighting enough)

168
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,980
Excuse me sir are you basically
saying that the Titans are immortal?

169
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,800
No I'm not, there is in fact 
one way to ensure death

170
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,860
Strike here!

171
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,120
If the back of their neck takes adequate damage a Titan will not regenerate

172
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,140
This is the chink in the proverbial armor

173
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:54,180
That as you may have surmised is where 
the flush paring blades you see here come in

174
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,760
A good deep strike with one of these 
To a Titans weak spot

175
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,620
And the monster has left no time to regenerate

176
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,800
They die and stay dead

177
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,580
Look at it this way Armin
It's a golden opportunity

178
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,440
I mean if we prove our worthless soldiers right here

179
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,500
We'll rise up right through the ranks before long 
we could even be leading our own regiment

180
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,120
we could bypass rookie status altogether

181
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,180
Sounds good I'm with you all the way

182
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,760
Now now boys you're not the only ones in your class 
save some of the glory for the rest of us

183
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,630
Good luck beating us to the punch a second time Eren
No head starts for you this round

184
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,340
-Is that a challenge ? 
-Listen up whoever kills the most Titans

185
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,560
Gets bragging rights

186
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,200
Heh! Better not fudge your scores
(Squadron 34 move out the vanguard needs support)

187
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Right give them hell!

188
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,200
There is so many of them

189
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,079
The vanguards been completely overwhelmed 
I don't believe this

190
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,640
those guys always talk so big

191
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,740
I thought things will be hearty

192
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,600
But this? this is insane

193
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,200
We've got an abnormal!

194
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,540
Hold on!

195
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,720
Oh God please help me!

196
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,240
You bastard

197
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,780
-Eren!
-Wait stay with the group

198
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,000
Get back here
you gonna pay for killing my friend

199
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,940
You're not getting away

200
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,160
-Eren
-Oh God no!

201
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,260
Please help i don't want to die

202
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,080
Why?

203
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,740
My friends are being devoured 
And all I could do is watch

204
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,640
What's wrong with me

205
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,040
Why can't I move?

206
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,500
No  Armin

207
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,300
[Armin]: Eren! Eren!

208
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,460
[Armin]: Eren!

209
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,440
-Why are you shouting?
-Sorry

210
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,960
I found a book my grandpa keeps hidden away

211
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,380
Believe it or not it's about life on the outside

212
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,060
I really hope this is your idea of a joke 
stuff about the outside world is illegal

213
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,280
Seriously you could go to jail for them

214
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,080
Trust me you change your mind if you knew what was actually out there

215
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,120
For example; according to this book most of the world 
is covered with salty water so deep

216
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,180
you can't reach the bottom

217
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,840
There's a name for it too they call it the sea

218
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,692
Like salty for real? 
c'mon you're making it up

219
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,420
If something valuable like salt

220
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,640
Was just floating around underwater merchants 
would have scooped it out ages ago

221
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,780
That's the thing the sea never runs out
It's that big!

222
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,940
Yeah whatever

223
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,860
Just bear with me there's a lot more than salt

224
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,220
Water that glows like fire, fields of ice

225
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,740
Giant rocks that take days to climb

226
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,280
Imagine how huge the outside world must be

227
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,000
It does sounds really neat

228
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,340
Ok you've got to promise on your life not to tell anyone

229
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:58,400
But my parents are, well they're going to sneak 
outside the walls to see for themselves

230
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,880
Don't know what it's like firsthand look at me

231
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:09,020
We should do it ourselves one day we can have 
adventures like the guy who wrote this book

232
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,900
Eren!

233
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,020
I refuse to die like this
Understand?

234
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,660
Armin listen

235
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:45,700
We still going to the outside world 
that things you told me about it

236
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,980
I have to see them

237
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,040
I have to-

238
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,260
Eren! NO!

239
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:58,880
All of a sudden it's raining the sound
is so faint so gentle

240
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:07,160
The scent is so light flowers odd now
we can remind you of something so horrible
