1
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:31,609
just like that everything changed

2
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:41,290
at that terrible moment in our hearts we
knew

3
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:47,540
home was a pen
humanity cattle

4
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,179
my brothers, for humanity

5
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:18,310
we should get back

6
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:27,710
I'm not but I just it's like the dream I
was having one on forever it's gone now

7
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,930
what was it about

8
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:52,200
Eren have you been crying

9
00:04:52,200 --> 00:05:11,020
ribbon rock, stone, no my brethren they're
bastions of faith

10
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,660
might wanna have your dad 
look into that

11
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:22,380
right just tearing up is usually a mental thing

12
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,180
hey Mr. Hannes 
oh you just get on Mikasa's bad side

13
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,300
No, what're you even talking about

14
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,060
huh you smell like a tavern

15
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,240
the fully tears recovers an ale

16
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,740
of course 
you kids care for a swig
aren't sure on watch?

17
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,600
Yep watch in the okay
We are thirsty work playing sentry

18
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,480
Pinochle only goes so far to chase off the boredom

19
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,040
Little nip now and then
keeps us all on our courage for a spell

20
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,960
Perks of being a guard

21
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,080
How do you expect to fight
 if you're so loose on your feet

22
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,410
Huh
Now why on earth would I have to fight

23
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,289
what do you think what if they break
through the walls

24
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:08,820
we'd be sitting ducks on your watch

25
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:15,104
Eren,  kid please use your inside voice

26
00:06:15,104 --> 00:06:19,680
Your doc's kid has some fire in him

27
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,763
Listen the only thing they've done to the wall

28
00:06:21,763 --> 00:06:23,500
In the past hundred years is scratch at it

29
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,920
I have the feeling if they get 
in their big heads to do something else

30
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,280
We'll be more than ready for him

31
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,480
A feeling? what if any of you actually done
To be ready for him

32
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,720
Dad says you've got a face sharp

33
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,800
Ah good dr. Yeager...yeah well

34
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,920
Can't argue with a man who's single-handedly 
spared us from the plague

35
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,280
Thing is he's talking about his scalpel

36
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,980
What we do is in half as important

37
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,060
Hey no disrespect to your father

38
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,763
But a soldier's time beyond the wall

39
00:06:52,763 --> 00:06:55,620
Kind of tends to put the whole issue 
into a different perspective

40
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,820
You see him grooving around out there,
 mindless dead-eyed

41
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,500
Wait a minute,

42
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,080
Sounds to me like you don't even think
that they're all that dangerous

43
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,340
Oh great, then at least have
the decency to stop calling yourself a garrison

44
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,640
People might get the wrong idea

45
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,820
Good point

46
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,060
Look at it this way huh

47
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,180
If a garrison is actually doing
what people think it oughta we're up a creek

48
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,737
Personally I take a lot of stock

49
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:27,700
In being called a freeloader means things are good

50
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,100
It's how I can measure peace of mind

51
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,100
Good we live in a cage

52
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,940
All we do is eat and sleep

53
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,540
That's it end of story

54
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,240
We have the peace of mind of livestock

55
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,640
Man you were right about the kid having fire

56
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,600
Careful not to cry it out

57
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,120
You coming back to the game or what ?

58
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,540
Yeah, hey where are you going?

59
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,660
The mouth on that kid

60
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
He's just a kid

61
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,720
Tends to dream bigger 
than life really wants him to

62
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,880
Eren you should let 
the Scout regiment thing go

63
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,080
Seriously? why does everybody think they're a joke

64
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,200
What people think about them isn't really the issue

65
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,480
Perfect timing

66
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,540
They're back we can make it if we hurry 
get a move on I want a good view

67
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,300
I can't see spot

68
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,940
Sure taking a hit haven't  they?
yeah rest of them got eaten

69
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,760
That's what happens when pride takes you
outside the walls

70
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:40,100
Moses peg your pardon, where's my son

71
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:45,100
He should be with you all oh please tell me he made it

72
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,000
I wish I had better news 
give it to her

73
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,200
I'm sorry it's all that was left of him

74
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,040
He did good yes, he was brave

75
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,440
Tell me my son stood his ground to the better end

76
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,560
that his death meant something

77
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,800
Tell me his sacrifice gave us a better chance

78
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,780
He was brave

79
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:10,180
But, his sacrifice did nothing
so with all our losses it's ever the same

80
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,140
Today with lost we have nothing

81
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,740
Your son died because of me 
I sent him to his death

82
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,180
I sent all of them to their death
and there is nothing to show for it

83
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,780
All of them have mounts to nothing

84
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,080
Uplifting huh
Oh sure

85
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,760
Nothing like seeing our hard-earned taxes

86
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,420
Go toward keeping those bastards 
fat and happy on human gris-

87
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,180
You little punk

88
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,660
What are you doing? let me go
yeah that's right you better run

89
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,820
Alright I get it stop already

90
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,100
Great firewood everywhere perfect

91
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:17,200
So are you still bound and determined 
to become one of them the scouts?

92
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,260
Just help me pick thesis up

93
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,540
Like there is much to begin with

94
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,340
hey we're home

95
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,560
welcome back kids

96
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,620
Wow somebody worked hard to keep us in fuel for the next several days

97
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,320
whatever

98
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,860
what was that for your

99
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,180
Your earlobe's red which means you've got something to hide

100
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,960
Mikasa I helped you again now didn't she

101
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,700
hey where you off to dad?
a patient?

102
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,700
yes, some folks in the interior
 should be back in about a week or so

103
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,960
so um Eren thinking about joining the Scouts

104
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,200
where do you keep secret, mouth?

105
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,540
get that ridiculous thought out of your head this instant young man

106
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,400
no son of mine is going to be fodder
do I make myself absolutely clear

107
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,080
stop yelling at me

108
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:46,380
-don't you dare 
-it's a nightmare Eren the outside you really have no idea

109
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,240
yeah i get it okay but

110
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,530
but it's gotta be better than this life I'm not stupid

111
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:57,940
I know it's ugly out there I know
there's death around every corner but

112
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,960
We can't just give up on it

113
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,440
'cuz otherwise
this nightmare never gonna end

114
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,040
I see

115
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:16,700
Excuse me I'll do late for the fair 
darling wait scold the boy for heaven's sake

116
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,900
Scold him? dear please
think this through

117
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,320
Mere words won't hold back the boy's curiosity

118
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,300
Eren, behave while I'm gone

119
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,000
And I'll let you in on what 
I've been doing in the cellar

120
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,860
Agreed? 
Yes sir you got it

121
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,100
Have a good trip

122
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,980
-I meant what I said
-What?

123
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,640
The whole idea is just irresponsible

124
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,200
Huh irresponsible?

125
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,858
so what it's more grown-up to settle for a living

126
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:52,740
In fear behind some stupid wall your whole pointless life

127
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,660
Eren

128
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,000
Mikasa the boy needs to be protected
from himself

129
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,280
Promise me whatever happens

130
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,760
I can count on you to have his back

131
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,300
Huh
Where's the sacrilege now huh

132
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,540
Or does your philosophy say it's wrong to fight back too 
as a matter of fact it does

133
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,300
I'd rather take a few lumps and brawl like a beast 
oh so now I'm a beast

134
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,400
Take a good hard look at yourself and tell me you're not acting like one

135
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,740
You resort to violence because your brains the size of a walnut

136
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,720
So pummel me all you want

137
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,120
I've already won yeah well you know what I'm a sore loser

138
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,680
Back off

139
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,760
It's Eren, okay look he's here back for more?

140
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,600
You think he would've learned his lesson?

141
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,740
Give this one to me oh crap she is with him

142
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,820
Just run

143
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,420
That's all it takes one look I'm just that scary

144
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,120
Well one of you is

145
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,138
Where'd they get you Armin ?

146
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,280
it's alright thank you

147
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,160
Okay

148
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,100
Oh they just heard me rattling 
on about how man kind's future

149
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,480
Laid beyond the walls

150
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,840
Doubted they understood half of it 
but still

151
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,100
idiots

152
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,320
Why is it gotta be this way

153
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,340
Why can't people just let us dream

154
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,880
The walls are a powerful idea

155
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,140
We've survived for a hundred years because of them

156
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,320
No one's keen on tempting fate

157
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,860
I may not agree with that sentiment

158
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,720
But I can see
where they're coming from

159
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,060
It's human nature Eren

160
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,180
When all said and done the government's policies

161
00:16:45,182 --> 00:16:46,420
Are a reflection of our fear

162
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,880
Yeah the rest of the hurts
maybe I say to hell with them

163
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,040
Someone's gonna hear you

164
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,620
Keep it down

165
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,280
-Why would i care you rat me out either way 
-What?

166
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,220
I never promised you anything

167
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,360
Your folks know about the scouts

168
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,980
Basically and they're not too pleased

169
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,720
Yeah big shock

170
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,540
It's sad but most people here are
willing to settle for

171
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,020
In exchange for some fleeting sense of security, 
you know?

172
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,880
And make no mistake it absolutely is fleeting

173
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,060
The walls can't hold forever

174
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,940
Only a matter of time

175
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,920
Armin what are you doing

176
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,580
Talk to me what's going on is it kind of explosion or wha-

177
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,580
that's impossible

178
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,840
That wall's 50 meters high

179
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,840
Oh, God

180
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,380
It's a titan

181
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,680
It blasted a hole

182
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,320
Like it was kicking a rock

183
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,700
[people]: Run for your lives 
It breaks through the wall

184
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,340
We have to go

185
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,300
Eren, no!

186
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,640
Our house is in that direction 
Mom so is by herself

187
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,520
Mikasa!

188
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,380
This...this is the end
They're inside

189
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,960
We....every last one of us is going to be devoured

190
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,760
Our house is fine...our house is fine

191
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,300
You'll turn the corner and it's gonna be standing there in one piece...just like always

192
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,100
Mom!

193
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,160
Mom!

194
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,060
Eren wait

195
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,140
Eren: Mikasa...grab that and then hoist with everything you got

196
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,200
Oh no!

197
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,080
Eren: Hurry up! damn it
Mikasa: I'm trying

198
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,500
It's them....you've got to get out of here

199
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,160
Eren just take Mikasa and run..Now!

200
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,460
Eren: I want to more than anything but first i need you on your feet

201
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,280
Sweetie listen to me my legs have been crushed

202
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,340
Even if you could get me out of here I can't run
There's no time

203
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,020
Eren: whatever i can carry you

204
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,040
Well you can just shut up and listen to me
For once in your life

205
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,700
One thing I'm asking you one thing make

206
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,960
Mikasa make him
Mikasa: i can't

207
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,060
You want all three of us to die

208
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,540
Hannes !

209
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,480
take the children and get them out of here

210
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,120
come on Karla that's not our only option

211
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,160
Hannes: Hey I'm a trained soldier my skill set
is killing Titans and saving lives

212
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,720
Karla: No wait don't do this please

213
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,519
nothing fits you just take it down get
all three of them out of harm's way

214
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,800
Pay good on the debt you owe

215
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,520
Eren: No ..what are you doing?
Put me down you bastard

216
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,880
Karla: Thank you Hannes

217
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,740
Eren: wait...No!

218
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
We cant just leave her

219
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,860
Karla: I love you
You hear me? stay alive

220
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,360
Karla: Don't leave me

221
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,380
Eren: Stop it! No!

222
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,900
It just like that everything changed

223
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:46,600
At that terrible moment in our hearts we
knew home was a pen....humanity cattle

224
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,220
Shiganshina  crumbles prayers are
useless tears are absurd

225
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,760
Death achenes are nothing 
When total ruin is your reality

226
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,920
All that's left of any value is revenge
