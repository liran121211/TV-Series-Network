1
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,802
Reiner!

2
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,001
Eren!

3
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:49,048
I think the fight's over.
We're out of strength.

4
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,846
At this point,
I can't exactly kill Reiner.

5
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,810
In that case, let's go back home.

6
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,566
See you later, Reiner.

7
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:29,172
Protect the airship from below!
Use every last shot you've got!

8
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:35,136
They are retreating.
Does this mean we're safe?

9
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,681
They are running.

10
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,645
Gabi!

11
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:47,690
Eren Jaeger!

12
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,526
Gabi!

13
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,027
You won't get away!

14
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,946
I'm going to kill you!

15
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,961
Damn, you're a filthy sight.

16
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,048
Did you fall into a pile of shit?

17
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,467
Eren.

18
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,970
Captain.

19
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,861
This brings back memories, Eren.

20
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,157
You have such a kickable face.

21
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,620
After you're all tied up,
we'll have a chat.

22
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:53,334
That's fine, but I explained
everything in the letters.

23
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,296
Did you not understand it?

24
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,883
That face…

25
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:05,054
It reminds me of the rotten shits
who lived underground.

26
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,558
I never thought I would see it on you.

27
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,145
Cheer up.

28
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,981
Everything happened like you wanted.

29
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,493
Stop them! Kill every last one you can!

30
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,040
Everybody, get in now!

31
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,251
They have got nothing
to take down an airship!

32
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,378
Jean!

33
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:41,007
You go! I'll hold the rear!

34
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,010
I'm counting on you, Commander Lobov!

35
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,512
I told you, I'm a recruit!

36
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,725
Nobody needs the Garrison anymore!

37
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,521
Especially not some overpaid geezer!

38
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,649
Jean!

39
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,776
Grab on!

40
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,697
Who's left?

41
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,783
We're still waiting on Squad Lima.

42
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,411
As far as we know,
there are six casualties.

43
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,914
I see. Shit!

44
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,042
That's nothing compared
to the damage we did!

45
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,795
It's a huge victory!

46
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:24,008
The New Eldian Empire's
first battle ends in victory!

47
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,970
-Yes!
-Yes!

48
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:33,351
Tonight, we celebrate in honor
of our six fallen heroes!

49
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,855
First battle, huh?

50
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,775
How many more until the fighting ends?

51
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,112
Just how many have to die?

52
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,786
Anyway, I'm just glad we survived again.

53
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:57,208
It's not very fair to the others,
but you guys are special…

54
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,085
to me.

55
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:09,971
That hurts, idiot.
Don't hug us while wearing hard-ass gear.

56
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,097
Excuse me, Jean?

57
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,810
You're the idiot for always fussing over
your tiny-ass beard!

58
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,727
What?

59
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:20,690
That's right!
Why grow a beard if you can't eat it?

60
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,691
What?

61
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,318
Say, are we eating soon?

62
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,404
Not until we reach the island.

63
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,115
What a useless leader you are.

64
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,117
Gabi!

65
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,205
Gabi, wait!

66
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,888
Come on. That's enough.

67
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,641
They are flying away.
Running after them is pointless.

68
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,852
Even you know that.

69
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,817
Zofia…

70
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,614
Zofia's body was crushed under debris.

71
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,616
I was sitting right next to her.

72
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,747
Udo tried to help her,
but he got trampled by the stampede.

73
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,001
Stepped on repeatedly
until his head split open.

74
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,379
And the two gate guards…

75
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,215
They stopped me.

76
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,593
I was trying to run back to the plaza.

77
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:36,891
I'm an Eldian, but they told me
to turn back because it's dangerous.

78
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,354
Then they were shot by a girl
on the roof and died.

79
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:51,072
Being an Eldian born in the zone,
people spit at me when I go outside.

80
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:57,161
I've had a lot of miserable memories,
but that's why I try so hard.

81
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,915
To show the world that Eldians
are good people!

82
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:07,296
So that someday,
we could be proud of our Eldian armbands!

83
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,591
I worked hard believing it could happen!

84
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,510
But they crushed everything!

85
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,221
This internment zone is my home!

86
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,350
It's where the people I care about live!

87
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,271
Isn't trampling on it unforgivable?

88
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:30,361
And yet, you're telling me
not to run after them?

89
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,449
When Zeke was killed before our eyes
and we could do nothing?

90
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,161
Not knowing why any of this happened?

91
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,664
Why, Reiner?

92
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:46,460
Why was my mom eaten by a Titan?

93
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,048
They were trampled on.

94
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:51,966
What?

95
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:57,805
The enemy was attacked by Marley Warriors
and lots of people died.

96
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,932
This is revenge.

97
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,603
Did you…

98
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,105
see it happen?

99
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,734
No, I didn't.

100
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,195
Neither did I.

101
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:29,879
Besides, they are all just island devils
who threaten world peace.

102
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,756
You should know that!

103
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:36,636
They are cruel devils
who have always deserved to die.

104
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,137
They are nothing like us.

105
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,602
Reiner, I'm the same as you.

106
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,481
Across the sea, within the Walls…

107
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,316
It's the same.

108
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,701
Squad Lima? That means everyone's aboard.

109
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,538
Tell the bridge we're good to ascend!

110
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,706
Roger!

111
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,796
What?

112
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,508
A kid?

113
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,394
It hit!

114
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,115
It's still attached.

115
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,952
Gabi!

116
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,372
What do you think you're doing?

117
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,707
This trigger…

118
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,292
If I pull it…

119
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,047
Gabi…

120
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,384
Don't tell me
you're thinking of boarding it!

121
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,846
I'm going to kill those island devils!

122
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,640
You'll just end up dead, idiot!

123
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:10,104
Tell my mom and dad.
Let Reiner and the others know.

124
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,065
That I fought until the end.

125
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,068
Even if we don't win today,

126
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,822
you guys will carry on my will.

127
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,159
Falco! Gabi!

128
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,202
What the hell are you guys doing?

129
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,496
My brother…

130
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,457
Goodbye, Falco.

131
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,335
You were one of the good ones.

132
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,045
What?

133
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:42,052
You have to rescue Gabi
from the dark future that awaits us.

134
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:47,975
Falco!

135
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,148
Falco?

136
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,358
Why?

137
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,362
The one who should inherit
the Armored Titan is me!

138
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,822
What?

139
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,081
Did you hear a sound just now?

140
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:15,920
-Hey! Quiet down!
-Make some noise! Victory!

141
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,213
-Yes!
-Yes!

142
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,631
Hey!

143
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,008
Isn't Lobov still out there?

144
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,844
No, I think he came aboard.

145
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,657
Sasha!

146
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,284
MARLEY MILITARY'S OFFICIAL RIFLE

147
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,452
THE OFFICIAL BOLT-ACTION RIFLE
FIRES FIVE SHOTS

148
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,745
CAN BE EQUIPPED WITH
THE STANDARD-ISSUE KNIFE AS A BAYONET

149
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:50,955
USED REGULARLY BY
THE WARRIOR UNIT, ARMY, AND NAVY

150
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,764
You bastard!

151
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,309
-Sasha! Hey!
-What?

152
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,437
Hang in there! Hey!

153
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:21,110
You're so damn loud…

154
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:28,325
Are we… eating soon?

155
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,370
Bandages, now!
We've got to stop the bleeding!

156
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,329
Right!

157
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,498
Sasha! Make it to the island!

158
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,043
Meat…

159
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,563
Jean, they climbed aboard
using Lobov's ODM gear.

160
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,898
What?

161
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,902
I'll toss them outside. All right?

162
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,993
If we toss kids out of an airship,

163
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,872
will the killing ever end?

164
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,177
What happened to Braun and Grice?

165
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,682
They ran off without warning
and never came back.

166
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,814
Pieck.

167
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,987
Commander, I remember…

168
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:54,787
There was a Marley soldier
who led Galliard and me into a trap.

169
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:02,002
I remember seeing
that same soldier three years ago.

170
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,589
They were on the first scout fleet

171
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,219
sent to Paradis after Reiner came back.

172
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,428
What?

173
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,973
The missing scout ships?

174
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,976
Yes. I'm sure of it.

175
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,438
They looked so awful with a beard.

176
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:26,235
Hey. Are you going to wear that forever?

177
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,236
What?

178
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,489
I thought it was well-received.

179
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,121
They are still celebrating?

180
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,040
Don't touch me, you devils!

181
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,001
We haven't lost yet!

182
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:46,714
The rest of our comrades
will carry on the will of War Chief Zeke!

183
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,924
Gabi, stop!

184
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,261
What do we do with them, Jean?

185
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:58,017
Us true Eldians
are going to haunt you until you die!

186
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,812
Pass that on to your ringleader
after I'm dead!

187
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,106
I'll take you to him.

188
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,861
You can tell him exactly what you told me.

189
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,498
How did you identify the soldier?

190
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:28,672
Well, it's someone I had
a particular interest in.

191
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:34,178
Because she's a devout follower of Zeke.

192
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,473
Gabi? Falco?

193
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,808
Why are you here?

194
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,310
Why…

195
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,312
I could ask you the same.

196
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,688
You're alive?

197
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,940
Why did you let them capture you?

198
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,946
Who are these kids?

199
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,326
They killed Lobov
and used his gear to come aboard.

200
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,829
Sasha was shot by this one here.

201
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,084
I don't think she's going to make it.

202
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,676
I'm leaving the rest to you, Onyankopon.

203
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,178
You got it, Hanji!

204
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,015
Well?

205
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,936
Did everything play out
as you hoped, Zeke Jaeger?

206
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,564
What?

207
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:33,320
For the most part,
but there were a few miscalculations.

208
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,323
Zeke…

209
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,201
What? Who are these kids?

210
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,079
Miscalculations.

211
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,664
Yelena!

212
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:47,209
What the hell happened
to trapping the Cart Titan and Jaw Titan?

213
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,878
People died because of you!

214
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,171
I'm sorry.

215
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,091
I assure you they fell down the hole,

216
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,468
but it's still my fault.

217
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,139
And to cover for that slipup,

218
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,642
the Beast Titan chucked more rocks
at us than planned.

219
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:07,479
That was some clever improv
for a clown like you.

220
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,731
Wouldn't you say, hairball?

221
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,693
Don't glare at me like that, Levi.

222
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:16,071
What if I piss my pants?

223
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,657
And you're quite the actor yourself,

224
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,452
considering you want to kill me so bad.

225
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:28,750
I'm the kind of person
who saves the best bite for last.

226
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,129
I like to savor the taste.

227
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:39,011
We killed the Marley brass
and destroyed their port and fleet.

228
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,763
That should buy us some time.

229
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:47,019
Until the whole world launches
a joint attack on Paradis?

230
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:52,274
Every time you're caught by the enemy,
we sacrifice lives to get you back.

231
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,527
No matter how many it takes.

232
00:19:56,111 --> 00:20:01,491
And yet knowing that, you went
so far as to make yourself a hostage.

233
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,412
Just like you hoped,
we didn't have much choice.

234
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:12,044
You put your trust in us
and we lost our trust in you.

235
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:18,425
But now we have the Founding Titan
and a Titan with royal blood.

236
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:24,806
The cost of those sacrifices
will be paid through Eldia's freedom.

237
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,736
Sasha…

238
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,947
is dead.

239
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,969
Conny.

240
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:07,975
Did Sasha have any last words?

241
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,060
She said…

242
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,062
"Meat."

243
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:28,453
I brought some meat
from the officers' storehouse!

244
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,958
It'll be fine!

245
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:37,504
We can just get more cattle and sheep
once we retake our land!

246
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:56,940
Eren, Sasha only died
because you dragged the Scouts into this.

247
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:45,507
Could they have taken some other path?

248
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,593
Unable to change the past,

249
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:53,390
they must continue
down the one before them.

250
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,934
Next episode, "Brave Volunteers."
