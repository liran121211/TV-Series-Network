1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,670
Don't go!

2
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:06,756
-Well, your father needs to get going.
-No!

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,677
Be good kids
and listen to your big sister.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,554
-Where are you going?
-Don't leave!

5
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:15,181
-Bring me something!
-I want to go, too!

6
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:18,768
-No fair!
-Let me come with you!

7
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:22,814
-Bring us with you!
-Sorry. I'm afraid not this time.

8
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:26,317
-What? How come?
-It's not fair!

9
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:31,448
Behave, you guys! Don't be selfish!
You're making it hard for him!

10
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,824
Fine.

11
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:36,202
Make sure all the kids get along.

12
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,955
Yes! Good luck with your work!

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,292
Thanks. I think it's time I head out.

14
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,295
-Take care!
-Bring me something!

15
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,713
Darling…

16
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,842
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,344
Take care of the kids.

18
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,392
Let's go.

19
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:09,444
I suppose if I'm attacked,
it will be during the speech?

20
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:13,823
I can't say for sure,
but that seems the most likely.

21
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:19,037
Only then will most of our brass
be gathered in one spot.

22
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:25,668
However, it's protocol to make escape
plans at the last moment for security.

23
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,588
Naturally, VIPs will use carriages.

24
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:32,592
Let's sit them
at the "special seats" on the edge.

25
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,595
Clump them together as much as possible.

26
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,224
Are you sure about this?

27
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:44,771
Compared to our predecessors,
the Tyburs haven't been playing around.

28
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:49,275
We've been building relations
with the world's elite,

29
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,739
improving the reputation of Eldians,
and watching Paradis Island's movements.

30
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:59,119
But we should have been watching
our own backyard.

31
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:04,666
Before we knew it, we had enemies
crossing the sea and at our necks.

32
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,461
At this point, they might get sliced
at any moment.

33
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:13,758
It's the conspirators working
with Paradis who I fear most.

34
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,928
We still don't know who they are.

35
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:22,100
As you know, our motherland,
Marley, has many enemies.

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,769
Some, in our own military.

37
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:28,565
We'll smoke them out
by lighting a fire under their asses.

38
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,028
We can plan for their attack
and use it to our advantage.

39
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,117
Unless you have a better idea,
we proceed as planned.

40
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:44,289
Even if they take the bait,
we lose way too much.

41
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,125
We'll sacrifice incompetent officers.

42
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:52,881
If the enemy's goal is to damage
Marley's military, it works perfectly.

43
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:58,553
When you rebuild the military, the party
will approve whomever you choose.

44
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,307
But so many will die.

45
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,309
Most of them will be Eldians!

46
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,185
They are the spawn of the devil!

47
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,693
Don't change on me now, Commander Magath.

48
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:20,533
You've sent countless Eldians marching
into machine guns and land mines.

49
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:25,163
Why does it matter
whether they wear uniforms or not?

50
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,041
Just keep doing what you've always done.

51
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,254
Let me say one thing.

52
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,632
This isn't war.

53
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,928
We don't know the enemy,
their goal, or how they'll attack.

54
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,556
Plus, the venue will be packed
with a huge crowd.

55
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:51,731
Lord Tybur,
I doubt I'll be able to protect you.

56
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,567
If we proceed, you will die.

57
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,112
They won't pass you up as bait.

58
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,203
Of course. I'm prepared for that.

59
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:10,667
Unless I stand on stage,
the world will not take notice.

60
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,713
The military, newspapers, and ambassadors
won't gather in one place.

61
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:20,677
Above all,
the Eldians of the internment zone and I

62
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,887
must be made tragic victims.

63
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,892
Victims of an "unforeseen attack."

64
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:33,815
If I am the sole survivor,
the world will not become our ally.

65
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:44,784
There's no doubt
that Eldians are the spawn of the devil.

66
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,287
And there's no doubt that…

67
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,622
we are devils ourselves.

68
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,389
Get up, Gabi! Udo!

69
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,724
Stand up! Hurry!

70
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,604
Zofia?

71
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,317
-Zofia!
-Udo, don't!

72
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,153
-Zofia!
-Udo, get back!

73
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,781
Hurry! We've got to lift this!

74
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,158
Udo!

75
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,387
Brother…

76
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:56,225
You fulfilled the Tyburs' duty admirably.

77
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,254
Commander Magath,
the War Hammer Titan is getting wrecked!

78
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,964
Commander! The Warriors are missing!

79
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,259
-General Calvi and the brass are dead!
-We should check for survivors!

80
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,928
-It's dangerous here!
-We need orders!

81
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:32,887
Commander!

82
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,266
Commander?

83
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:43,314
It's a useless plink, but this signals
the beginning of Marley's counterattack.

84
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,651
I can't believe they would make
such a grand entrance.

85
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:53,574
What's more, it looks to be the usurper
of the Founding Titan, the Attack Titan.

86
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,078
Eren Jaeger has come in person!

87
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,623
Saves us a trip to the island.

88
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,334
Get in position! Prepare for battle!

89
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,835
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

90
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,312
Hey, what's all the ruckus about?

91
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,856
What are you doing? We have to get out--

92
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,992
Remember it, people.

93
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,995
I'm the one who took the first shot.

94
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,128
Shit! What the hell?
It's a battlefield now!

95
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,422
Colt! How's Udo?

96
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,303
Not good. He needs the hospital.

97
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,972
Udo! You're kidding!

98
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,640
Shit!

99
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,644
Falco! Where are you?

100
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,775
What's happening out there?

101
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,654
By these tremors,
I would guess Titans are fighting.

102
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,781
Are you serious?

103
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,869
Us being trapped down here
is answer enough.

104
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,954
We've got to get out somehow.

105
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,080
How?

106
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:24,999
What the hell?

107
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:25,916
You're late!

108
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,127
-Pieck!
-Are you okay?

109
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,670
Throw us a rope!

110
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,838
Got it!

111
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,507
The Panzer Unit? How did they know?

112
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,552
I told them to follow
since Beardy was shady.

113
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,638
Was it then?

114
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,725
This soldier seems shady.
Follow behind us.

115
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,020
A Titan attacked during the speech!

116
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,063
For real?

117
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,857
The War Hammer Titan is fending it off!

118
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,525
Where's the Cart Titan's gear?

119
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,403
At the headquarters!
We'll have it done in 15!

120
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,113
-Make it ten!
-Roger!

121
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,448
I'm going ahead.

122
00:10:57,531 --> 00:11:00,368
Wait, Porco. Before you rush in…

123
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,744
What the…

124
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,913
You're kidding…

125
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,748
There's no way!

126
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,544
-Yes, it hit!
-It worked!

127
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,212
Anti-Titan Artillery packs a punch!

128
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,547
-Commander Magath!
-Reload!

129
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,757
Let's finish off Eren Jaeger!

130
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,552
Without the Founding Titan,
they are doomed!

131
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,678
-No.
-What?

132
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:04,223
Killing the Founding Titan
only postpones the problem.

133
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,184
We need to have
the War Hammer Titan eat it!

134
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,312
We're here to ensure that happens!

135
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,314
But, Commander…

136
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,444
I don't think the War Hammer Titan
is trying to eat it.

137
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,788
The War Hammer Titan is a monster!

138
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,498
It beat the Attack Titan!

139
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,417
The War Hammer Titan wins!

140
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,926
So that's Eren Jaeger, huh?

141
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,312
It's really going to finish him off!

142
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,775
Usurper, Eren Jaeger.

143
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:01,030
Do you have any last words?

144
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,540
Now or never, Mikasa.

145
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,749
You guys actually came.

146
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,961
Eren, please…

147
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,963
Come home.

148
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:01,799
THE WAR HAMMER TITAN

149
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:02,883
THE TITAN INHERITED BY THE TYBUR FAMILY

150
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,009
AND HELD BY WILLY'S
YOUNGER SISTER, LARA TYBUR

151
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,886
ITS BODY IS ENCASED IN A WHITE SHELL MADE
BY ITS EXTRAORDINARY HARDENING ABILITY

152
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:11,892
With the chain of command broken,
our military will be put to the test!

153
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,897
Call down all our troops
doing special training in the mountains!

154
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,316
Bring the fleet, too!

155
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,903
Converge on top of them
with 30,000 soldiers!

156
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,406
I want Liberio surrounded!

157
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:29,910
Don't let the Founding Titan
or a single island devil escape!

158
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:37,084
Have fun while it lasts.
There's no future for you now.

159
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:43,966
With this massacre, you just ensured
every major nation gets involved now.

160
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:50,055
The world will see the Eldian Empire
as a threat, just like Willy planned.

161
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,516
Now no one is going to let you live.

162
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:58,355
But even they must have known that
going into this.

163
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,774
Which means…

164
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,327
You damn devils!

165
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,370
Shoot them down!

166
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,668
Those morons!

167
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,006
Hey! Are you going to burn
the whole zone down?

168
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,886
What part of "keeping civilian casualties
to a minimum" don't you get, Floch?

169
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:33,015
The only thing here are enemies
and places they live!

170
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:38,103
Did you forget how they massacred
humanity inside the Walls?

171
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:42,149
We were eaten alive, damn it!
They have got it coming!

172
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,109
You're still saying that?

173
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,947
Look. Eren is telling us
something, to fight!

174
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,159
We shouldn't just wait
for our deaths in the Walls.

175
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:55,704
What we need is a devil like him!

176
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,956
Eren.

177
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:02,419
Do you have any idea what you have done?

178
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,008
You killed civilians.

179
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,804
You killed children, too.

180
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,350
You've done things that can't be undone.

181
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,943
Mikasa, it's not over yet.

182
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,656
Impossible! I blew away its nape!

183
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,117
And I crushed it with all my strength.

184
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,078
Yet, it's not dead.

185
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,085
I see.

186
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,673
The War Hammer Titan…

187
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,593
It uses hardening
to make whatever it needs.

188
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:56,306
That must be why it won't die,
no matter what we do.

189
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,601
Mikasa, get its attention.

190
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,396
If this works,
I can eat the War Hammer Titan.

191
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:09,737
Sorry, we're at full capacity!
And the kid is dead already!

192
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,114
Come on! At least look at him!

193
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,242
Aren't you a candidate?
Take a look around you!

194
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,869
We need you, Doc!

195
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,579
Okay, I'm coming!

196
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,544
Gabi, stay with your family.

197
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,839
I'm not sure if anywhere is safe.

198
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,633
Get as far from the plaza as possible.

199
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,595
I'm going to look for Falco and--

200
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,888
I'm going, too.

201
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:42,144
Because I don't understand
why Udo and Zofia had to die.

202
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,147
Wait, Gabi! Don't!

203
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,488
Hey, stop!

204
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,656
You're headed towards a war zone!

205
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,824
Gabi!

206
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,451
What are you doing here?

207
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,744
Mr. Gate Guard!

208
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,163
I'll fight, so let me through!

209
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,916
Don't be an idiot, brat!

210
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,168
Head back home and--

211
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,378
-What the…
-Enemy attack?

212
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,630
From where?

213
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,510
-They are above!
-Shit!

214
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,345
Go on, Gabi! Run!

215
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,306
Hey, are you--

216
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,561
Mister…

217
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,327
This side is blocked off. Let's go, Sasha.

218
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:44,414
Conny, did you forget about the lights?

219
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,208
Oh, right.

220
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,190
Jean, we stalled the reinforcements.

221
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,692
And the lights?

222
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,527
They are all in place.

223
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,445
Are things going well?

224
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,072
For the time being.

225
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,456
As long as we take that thing out in time.

226
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,711
But who knows?
Anything can happen at this point.

227
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,218
What's to come when this battle is over?

228
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:42,514
For us to know, we have to survive.

229
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,117
I knew something felt off to me.

230
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,622
It didn't seem right
how the War Hammer Titan appeared.

231
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,544
And that's because
its body formed from the feet up.

232
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:19,593
Not from its nape,
but from underneath the stage.

233
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,641
Which means its body is…

234
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,714
Shoot!

235
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,175
The War Hammer Titan
is about to get eaten!

236
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,605
I've been waiting for this moment!

237
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,816
I'm retaking the Founding Titan!

238
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,485
Eren!

239
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,657
What? I can't bite?

240
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,036
Was that him?

241
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,539
Is that… Ackermann?

242
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,421
This isn't looking good!

243
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,017
You're kidding…

244
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,269
Can't you see I'm a Titan?

245
00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:01,153
These guys are just humans,
yet they are coming to kill me?

246
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,364
These guys…

247
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,868
They are the devils of Paradis!

248
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,839
The devils of Paradis.

249
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:49,261
The Warriors take a stand
against soldiers who soar through the air.

250
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:53,390
Will Gabi and Falco's cries reach Reiner?

251
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,851
Next episode, "Assault."
