1
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:07,924
I keep having the same dream.

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,219
I dream about the guy
who hung himself in the fields.

3
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:17,475
Why did he tell us that story
right before he hung himself?

4
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,770
Obviously, that's something
we'll never know.

5
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:24,315
I bet he wanted someone to forgive him.

6
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,235
Considering we left Marcel and ran,

7
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,696
it's not like we can say much.

8
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,242
For some reason, I can't help but think…

9
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,912
That old man, I think what he wanted…

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,624
was to be judged by someone.

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,544
Hey.

12
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:47,380
It's been four years, Reiner.

13
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,634
Well…

14
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,969
What?

15
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:56,222
Aren't you two supposed to be old friends?

16
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,725
Isn't that right, Mr. Kruger?

17
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,979
Yes. There's so much to catch up on.

18
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,982
I don't even know where to start.

19
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,400
What?

20
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,320
Impossible…

21
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,364
Eren!

22
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,307
Lord Tybur, it's almost time.

23
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,058
Right.

24
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,144
My goodness!

25
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:11,608
Well, did you come to give me
a pep talk, Madam Azumabito?

26
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:16,112
I hope I'm not a bother.
I just came to see your face.

27
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,949
Given my stage fright,
I'm sure I look hideous.

28
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,870
No, you look courageous.

29
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,457
My whole clan knows how brave you are.

30
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,418
I wish you the best of luck.

31
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,463
I appreciate it, Lady Kiyomi.

32
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,549
Sit down, Reiner.

33
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:43,264
They are good seats, right?
You can hear everything on stage.

34
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,310
The building above us is all housing.

35
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,520
It's behind the stage,

36
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:54,984
but it's full of people
waiting for the curtains to rise.

37
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,906
Directly above us.

38
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,578
What? Mr. Kruger? Did you hurt your hand?

39
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,248
Yes. It's just a scratch.

40
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,002
Reiner, sit down.

41
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,677
Well, I think I'll head back.

42
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,053
No, Falco.

43
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,640
You should stay here and listen.

44
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,684
What?

45
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,895
Falco, just do as he says.

46
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,481
Okay.

47
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,026
Now then, shall we leave?

48
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:46,744
Oh, long time no see, Mr. Leonhart.

49
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,746
Mrs. Braun.

50
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,833
Not since your son came home, right?

51
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:57,547
Speaking of which,
I hear Hoover passed away in bed?

52
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,715
Yes.

53
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:04,637
He never failed to say how proud he was
of his son's sacrifice for Marley.

54
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,390
I'm sure your daughter also--

55
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,891
She's not dead.

56
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:16,190
Annie is alive.
She promised she would come back.

57
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:21,195
I can't believe the war will be declared

58
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,532
in the internment zone, of all places.

59
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,329
Wow! Even General Calvi came to the zone!

60
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,957
The whole backbone
of Marley's military is here!

61
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,335
And all these powerful families
and ambassadors!

62
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,965
Not to mention every newspaper
in the world that matters.

63
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,218
It's like we're in the world's spotlight!

64
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,597
The Tyburs sure are powerful.

65
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,974
Yet they are Eldians, same as us.

66
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,352
Oh, gosh!

67
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,604
It has begun.

68
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,482
Falco and Mr. Braun aren't back yet?

69
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:02,528
Warriors of Marley,
Commander Magath has summoned you.

70
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,758
Eren…

71
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,762
How? Why did you come here?

72
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,266
Same reason you did.

73
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:39,023
Don't you get it? The same reason you did.

74
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,652
Because I had no other choice.

75
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,909
Sounds like it started.

76
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,620
Let's listen.

77
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,542
Let's look back in time.

78
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,753
Roughly 100 years ago,

79
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:05,299
the Eldian Empire ruled the world
with the Power of the Titans.

80
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,763
From the rise of Founder Ymir until today,

81
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:15,309
Titans have robbed enough lives

82
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,438
to eradicate humanity three times over.

83
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:30,199
Countless cultures and people
have been wiped out by Titans,

84
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,327
their histories stolen away.

85
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:39,083
The Eldian Empire's path of slaughter
became humanity's history.

86
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,504
And when the Eldian Empire
ran out of enemies,

87
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,924
they soon began slaughtering one another.

88
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,344
The Great Titan War had begun.

89
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:55,349
Families holding the eight Titans
waged a bloody war.

90
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:01,355
Using this to his advantage,
one Marleyan sought victory.

91
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,983
It was the hero, Helos.

92
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,736
Thanks to his clever manipulations,

93
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:11,199
the Eldian Empire was tricked
into killing each other, one by one.

94
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,911
By joining hands with the Tybur family,

95
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:20,750
they forced the unbeatable King Fritz
to flee and retreat to the island.

96
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:26,506
However, though he fled to Paradis Island,

97
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,883
his power still remained.

98
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,515
Tens of millions of Titans
await on the island to trample the world.

99
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:44,106
To this day, the only reason we haven't
been trampled is merely a fluke.

100
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,568
Our scholars have no other explanation.

101
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:54,909
To eliminate this threat, our motherland,
Marley, sent four Titans to the island,

102
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,331
but they were beaten back
and only the Armored Titan returned.

103
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:07,296
The darkest blot on humanity's history,
the Eldian Empire, is alive and well.

104
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,341
Did you hear that, Reiner?

105
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,386
Isn't that why you destroyed the wall?

106
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,806
You guys were trying to save the world.

107
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,433
Weren't you?

108
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,521
You're wanted at the gate, Jaeger.

109
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,981
Fine.

110
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,941
This way, you two.

111
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:34,323
I feel like
I've seen you somewhere before.

112
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,075
Where are you from?

113
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,996
Out west by Lakua, but I was called here.

114
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,541
I didn't come to chitchat with Eldians.

115
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:47,837
That's a shame.
I kind of fancy your beard.

116
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,921
Hey!

117
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:49,839
It's Pieck!

118
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,008
The Panzer Unit!

119
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,802
Thanks for all your hard work!

120
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,722
We should be thanking you.

121
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,724
You're in a good mood today.

122
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,767
What are you doing? Let's go.

123
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,269
What was that?

124
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:09,358
Since they ride the Cart Titan into war
and all, it's good if we build a bond.

125
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,738
Didn't you just put a rift in that bond?

126
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,281
Anything?

127
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,742
Nothing strange as of yet.

128
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,202
I don't care how small it seems.

129
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,455
Report everything to me.

130
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,748
Yes, sir.

131
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,626
In here. Enter.

132
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,592
Where's Commander Magath?

133
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:35,718
Porco!

134
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:47,480
What's going on here?
Why is Vice-Captain Braun so scared?

135
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,567
Isn't Mr. Kruger an old friend of his?

136
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,448
Old friend? Like, how many years ago?

137
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,952
If it's more than four,
they met on Paradis Island!

138
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,955
No, there's no way!

139
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,708
Because that means…

140
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,543
Impossible…

141
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,921
Could it be…

142
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,214
THE PARADIS ISLAND OPERATION
TO RETAKE THE FOUNDING TITAN

143
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,757
A MISSION EXECUTED UNDER THEO MAGATH'S
COMMAND, FOUR WARRIORS WERE SENT

144
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,841
THEIR OBJECTIVE WAS
TO INFILTRATE PARADIS ISLAND

145
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:16,926
RETAKE THE FOUNDING TITAN
AND RETURN IT TO MARLEY

146
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:22,139
Now then, the story I've told
thus far is common knowledge.

147
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,185
However, the truth is somewhat different.

148
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:32,942
In passing down the War Hammer Titan,
the Tybur family inherited its memories.

149
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:38,447
I will now reveal the truths we learned
for the first time ever.

150
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,951
Some 100 years ago,

151
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:47,915
it was neither Helos nor the Tyburs
who ended the Great Titan War.

152
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,920
The one who ended the fighting
and saved the world…

153
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,755
was King Fritz.

154
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,468
He anguished over
the Eldian Empire's vicious history,

155
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,930
tired from the endless infighting,

156
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:08,060
and above all, he was pained by
the endless oppression of Marley.

157
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,356
When he inherited the Founding Titan,

158
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,195
he schemed with the Tybur family
and they fabricated a Marleyan hero.

159
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,864
His name…

160
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:20,990
Helos.

161
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:27,496
The King moved as many Eldians as he could
to the island and closed the gates.

162
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,916
He claimed that if they were threatened,

163
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,753
thousands of Titans
would be unleashed as revenge.

164
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:39,258
However, this was never his intention.

165
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:46,015
King Fritz made a vow renouncing war
so his ideology would be inherited.

166
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:51,270
Because of this, Karl Fritz's ideology
has been passed down,

167
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:55,774
and the Titans have never left
the island to attack.

168
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:03,073
That is, the one keeping our world safe
is the "vile" King of the Walls,

169
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,660
Karl Fritz, and his desire for peace.

170
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,624
Peace was all he wanted.

171
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:18,422
But if Marley grew strong and came
to take the Founding Titan or his life,

172
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,341
he would accept it.

173
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,720
He believed
the sins of the Eldians were so grave,

174
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,931
they could never be atoned for.

175
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,519
"However, until that day of retribution,

176
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:36,482
let me savor a brief paradise,
free of conflict within the Walls."

177
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,777
"That is all I ask of you."

178
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,947
That was his last request.

179
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,198
What?

180
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,699
What does this mean?

181
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,952
If this is true…

182
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:53,999
Marley and the Tyburs saving the world
was made up by King Fritz?

183
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,586
If the King of the Walls won't attack,

184
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,214
why do they say
Paradis Island is a threat?

185
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,632
Yes.

186
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,509
In exchange for our safety,

187
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:07,721
the Tybur family joined hands
with Karl Fritz

188
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,224
and sold out the Eldians to Marley.

189
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:16,230
We're no more than traitors
lavishing in crookedly earned honor.

190
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:21,735
The reason that I stand here
and willingly part with this sham

191
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:27,241
is because I know
our world is in great peril.

192
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,742
-Commander!
-What?

193
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:33,581
The Warriors and soldiers
sent to get them are missing.

194
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,000
Mobilize a search team!

195
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,042
Yes, sir!

196
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,005
Has it begun?

197
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,092
Damn, that hurt! Shit!

198
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,678
What the hell is this?

199
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,514
Must be a pit to restrain Warriors.

200
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,641
It's a classic trap.

201
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:57,021
Too cramped for one of us
to transform, let alone two.

202
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,857
Yes, we would be squashed to death.

203
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,193
Why did that scrawny soldier even do it?

204
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,528
I don't know,

205
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,198
but I feel like I've seen them before.

206
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,413
Stand there and watch.

207
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,707
This is my atonement.

208
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:26,800
Using the power of the Founding Titan,
Karl Fritz erected three walls.

209
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:32,640
These walls, formed by
tens of millions of Colossal Titans,

210
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,560
have served as a shield and spear,
safeguarding peace.

211
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:41,357
But recently, an uprising
took place on Paradis Island.

212
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:48,238
King Fritz's peace was undermined by
a person who stole the Founding Titan.

213
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:52,451
Once again, there's a threat to our world,

214
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,495
a rebel against peace!

215
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,956
His name…

216
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,832
Eren Jaeger!

217
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,128
You tricked me…

218
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,508
And here I respected you…

219
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,344
But you tricked me!

220
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:15,015
I'm sorry, Falco. I needed your help.

221
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,141
What?

222
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:21,146
The letters! The ones you had me send!

223
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,272
What were they?

224
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:30,656
They didn't reach my family,
but they did reach my comrades.

225
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,661
No way! You're kidding!

226
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,747
Your comrades?

227
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,709
The threat of Paradis Island

228
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:46,130
is the stampede of millions
of Colossal Titans, a rumbling.

229
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,427
As I mentioned, the vow renouncing war
prevents the King's bloodline

230
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,179
from fully using the Founding Titan.

231
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:59,309
But currently, this "Eren Jaeger"
who possesses the Founding Titan

232
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,730
may begin this rumbling at any moment.

233
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:08,902
Once the rumbling is set into motion,
there is nothing that we can do.

234
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:14,491
Nothing but tremble
at the footsteps of doom, fleeing in vain.

235
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:19,079
All lands and civilizations
will be trampled,

236
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,999
literally razed to the ground.

237
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,084
That's right.

238
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,085
What?

239
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:29,339
It's like Willy says, I'm the bad guy.

240
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,092
I might just destroy the world.

241
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,764
But to me, you were the bad guys, too.

242
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:43,353
That day, when the wall was destroyed
and Titans invaded my hometown,

243
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,939
I watched my mom get eaten.

244
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,276
I couldn't understand.

245
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,154
Why, Reiner?

246
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,075
Why was my mom eaten by a Titan?

247
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,993
Because…

248
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,747
on that day, we broke the wall.

249
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,124
Why did you break the wall?

250
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:10,964
To sneak in during the chaos
and see how the King would react.

251
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,175
What was your mission?

252
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:17,262
To retake the Founding Titan
and save the world.

253
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,514
I see.

254
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,642
If it was to save the world,

255
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,144
you didn't have much choice.

256
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,775
Back then, you told me,

257
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,238
"I'll make you guys suffer
and die in the worst way possible."

258
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,407
Isn't that why you came?

259
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,911
Oh, I vaguely remember saying that.

260
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,287
What?

261
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,164
Just forget it.

262
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,962
True, I saw everyone on the other side
of the sea as my enemy.

263
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,173
But then, I crossed the sea,

264
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:57,219
slept under the same roof as them,
ate the same food…

265
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,723
Reiner, I'm the same as you.

266
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,979
Sure, there are jerks here,
but there are good people, too.

267
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,484
Across the sea, within the Walls…

268
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,027
It's the same.

269
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,908
But you guys were taught
everyone in the Walls was a devil.

270
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:25,247
You were children who knew nothing,
but it was drilled into you.

271
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:30,085
You were just kids.
What could you even do?

272
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,754
Right, Reiner?

273
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,592
Hasn't that been eating away at you?

274
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,514
No! You're wrong, Eren!

275
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,685
That day, when Marcel was eaten,

276
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:51,273
Annie and Bertholdt tried to turn back
and end the mission.

277
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,984
But I…

278
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:58,113
I talked them into it and made them go on!

279
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,533
I wanted to be a hero!

280
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,119
I wanted people's respect!

281
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,164
It's my fault!

282
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,169
Your mom was eaten by a Titan
because of me!

283
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,380
I cursed the blood I was born with.

284
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:20,177
More than anyone,
I wished the Eldians were wiped out.

285
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,013
I'm sick of this… of myself!

286
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,307
Just kill me!

287
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,810
But I do not wish to die.

288
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,565
And that is because
I was born into this world.

289
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:38,278
We are people
of different races and nations!

290
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:43,825
However, it is time to join as one
and face this dreadful enemy!

291
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,998
Lend me your strength,
those of you who wish to live!

292
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,335
Those of you who wish for a future!

293
00:20:55,671 --> 00:21:00,592
If we work together,
we can overcome any obstacles in our way!

294
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:07,099
Like I thought, I'm the same as you.

295
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,476
What?

296
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:15,983
I want you to join me in the fight
against the devils of Paradis Island!

297
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,487
I think we were born this way.

298
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:27,244
Here and now, as representative of
the Marleyan government, I proclaim…

299
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,246
I keep moving forward.

300
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,248
What?

301
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,250
Until I destroy my enemies.

302
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:45,137
…to the enemy forces of Paradis,
a declaration of war--

303
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,922
The Attack Titan suddenly appears.

304
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:48,885
Amid its roars,
the crowd is slaughtered mercilessly.

305
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,431
To stop Eren's rampage,
the War Hammer swings.

306
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,934
Next episode, "The War Hammer Titan."
