1
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,092
I doubt this is something
you want to hear,

2
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:11,219
but just listen.

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,472
Three years ago…

4
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:19,728
Back then, we still might have been
able to change something.

5
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,147
THREE YEARS AGO

6
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,151
Captain!

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,030
The team that went ashore
hasn't made contact for two hours!

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,364
I see.

9
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:34,159
Prepare to send teams two and three.

10
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,160
Yes, sir!

11
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:39,914
This island of devils defeated
the Warrior Unit.

12
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:43,918
Whatever the cost,
Marley must learn what happened.

13
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:49,924
Hang on!

14
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,388
It's a devil!

15
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:17,202
Hello, friends from Marley!
Welcome to Paradis Island!

16
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,995
I'm Hanji!

17
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,500
I'm here to greet our guests
who have come so far across the sea!

18
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,545
Now step this way
and join us for some tea!

19
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:33,885
By the way, we're already friends
with this guest that arrived before you!

20
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:37,305
Isn't that right, Niccolo?

21
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:42,644
Captain! Forget about me
and shoot these devils!

22
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:47,232
-What are you saying, Niccolo?
-Captain!

23
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:50,110
He's tired of your shitty skit.

24
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,736
Niccolo!

25
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:57,408
Understand this, you devils!
Marley doesn't mingle with filthy blood!

26
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:01,121
Go drink your pig piss
with your filthy friends!

27
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,956
Hey!

28
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,000
Are you sure you want to be rude to us?

29
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,754
Can't you see the Titan behind you?

30
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,594
We'll never yield to you devils!

31
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,264
Say hello to this!

32
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:26,771
What?

33
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,987
Hands up, Yelena!

34
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,405
Drop your weapons.

35
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,448
What are you…

36
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,533
Do as she says.

37
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:43,037
Hanji, I would be happy
to accept your invitation.

38
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,123
Let's have tea.

39
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,045
I've longed to meet you…

40
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,256
Eren.

41
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,439
That huge lady of theirs
shot and killed her comrade.

42
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,150
I wonder what her goal is.

43
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,443
Who knows?

44
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,613
Whether a friend or foe,
she's not to be trusted.

45
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,073
No napping, Sasha.

46
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:48,246
But their willingness to share information
is unbelievably lucky for us.

47
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,040
Yes, we've been really lucky.

48
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,585
We stopped their landing by pure chance.

49
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,798
If Marley comes in force,
we'll be screwed.

50
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,675
We've got to do something.

51
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,678
Well…

52
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,680
Oh, my…

53
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:09,684
Oh, I see! That's how it shoots a bunch!

54
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,146
That's a standard-issue in Marley.

55
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,401
The Marley army
has 20,000 soldiers per division.

56
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,071
With fifty divisions,
that's one million soldiers.

57
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:28,077
There's also the navy with 3 fleets,
each comprised of 21 battleships.

58
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:33,583
They have made tremendous progress
in new weapons and aerial warfare as well.

59
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,376
Aerial?

60
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,586
Damn it!

61
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,464
Don't freak out
or they will think we're weak.

62
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,882
I know!

63
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:46,220
In other words, vehicles allowing one
to attack the enemy from the sky.

64
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,097
-What? From the sky?
-Hey!

65
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,895
If Marley had such capabilities
this whole time,

66
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,607
why haven't they attacked in over a year?

67
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,859
There are two main reasons.

68
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,738
One being the Pure Titans released here.

69
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:09,202
Even with the latest weapons,
they would hinder a land assault.

70
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:14,373
They were used as a tool
to confine Eldians within the Walls,

71
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:18,461
but in turn,
they have protected Eldia from invasion.

72
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,464
Yes. Well, isn't that funny?

73
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:26,844
Though dawn is coming soon,
and that's when Titans are active.

74
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,974
But if we're way out here,
sipping on tea outside the Walls,

75
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,603
you must have killed
all the Titans roaming around.

76
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,856
Is that true?

77
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,900
-What?
-And what if it is?

78
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,653
Are you going to report it to Marley?

79
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,950
No, it blows away my expectations.

80
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,953
And the second reason?

81
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:56,541
Currently, Marley is at war
with multiple nations.

82
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,335
They can't be bothered with Paradis.

83
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,673
You defeated the Warrior Unit,
the pride of Marley,

84
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:08,845
and captured two of their main weapons,
the Colossal Titan and Female Titan.

85
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,973
Marley's many enemies took notice

86
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:17,186
and were quick to unite and declare war.

87
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:22,859
If you guys are secret agents
who infiltrated Marley,

88
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,362
I'm guessing you came
from conquered nations?

89
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,365
Oh, am I right?

90
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:34,787
If you're going up against Marley,
I bet you've got big backers!

91
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,876
We're not secret agents
or anything of the sort.

92
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,670
We were powerless.

93
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:46,424
Marley took our homes
and forced us to be soldiers.

94
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,887
We were close to losing hope
at ever striking back.

95
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,515
Until we met him.

96
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,438
A Titan that people of the world feared,
calling it a devil.

97
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,733
But I saw something completely different.

98
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,152
A god.

99
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,198
One that gave hope to the powerless.

100
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:17,872
Under Zeke Jaeger's command,
we shot our superiors.

101
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,999
We're the Anti-Marleyan Volunteers.

102
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,084
Our goal…

103
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,629
To free the Eldian people.

104
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,634
That concludes Zeke Jaeger's requests.

105
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:33,804
"For the sake of all Eldians
whose existence is threatened--"

106
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,641
Absurd! I don't even want to hear it!

107
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,851
He's the Beast Titan!

108
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:43,272
He turned the people of Ragako
into Titans and incited a panic!

109
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,735
This is the same person
who nearly annihilated the Scouts!

110
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:52,657
His one and only goal
is to retake the Founding Titan.

111
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,495
Since he can't do it by force,
he'll attempt it diplomatically.

112
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,164
He should know that we'll expect that.

113
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,251
Let's hear what else he has to say.

114
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:10,132
"According to Zeke, he has a secret
plan to solve the Eldian issue."

115
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,176
"To carry it out,

116
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,264
it requires the Founding Titan
and a Titan with royal blood."

117
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,308
"With both, the world can be saved."

118
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:25,523
"However, he will only reveal the plan
when his conditions are met."

119
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,649
Bullshit!

120
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,569
He must think we're idiots!

121
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,528
Eren?

122
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,489
He's telling the truth. I remember…

123
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:38,744
The one time I was able to use
the Founding Titan's power

124
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,748
was when I touched
a Titan with royal blood.

125
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:49,380
That Titan had to be
my father's other wife, Dina Fritz.

126
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:56,429
Zeke, Dina's son, must have figured out
a way to elude the vow renouncing war.

127
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:01,309
The one single hope
remaining for us Eldians…

128
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:08,524
To wake the millions of Titans sleeping
in the Walls and activate the rumbling.

129
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,318
You…

130
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,821
Why did you keep quiet
about this for so long?

131
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,824
I was concerned for Historia's safety.

132
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:22,913
I couldn't let her get made into a Titan
based on some hunch of mine.

133
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,417
Yes, it was careless of me.

134
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,085
We'll talk about it later.

135
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:34,342
But if that's really true,
Zeke's secret plan holds up.

136
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,844
Are you nuts? You trust them?

137
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,265
Yes! We can't have all those
soldiers on the island!

138
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,850
We ought to hang them all!

139
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,020
No, we can't do that.

140
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,607
To protect the island
from Marley's scout ships,

141
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,318
we need the volunteers.

142
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,613
Without their wireless radio…

143
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,115
This is the first… scout fleet.

144
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,076
Request… aid.

145
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,370
This is the… first scout fleet.

146
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,789
Second fleet. Go ahead.

147
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,375
What a relief! Our ship ran aground!

148
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,378
We've been waiting for your help.

149
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,672
We're on the way! In the cove, huh?

150
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:18,135
How many ships? Don't worry!
Two are headed your way!

151
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,638
Hey!

152
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,641
Are you okay? We're coming to get you!

153
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,522
-It's the Colossal Titan!
-How?

154
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,150
Hey! It's the enemy!

155
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,527
Hurry! Jump!

156
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,528
Run!

157
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,654
Jump off!

158
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,204
Welcome to the filthy island
of filthy devils.

159
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,914
You're going to love it.

160
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,458
As long as you like pig piss.

161
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,462
You can leave if you want,
but not on a ship.

162
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,923
Are you good at swimming?

163
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,468
It was fun back then.

164
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:05,516
Certainly, we Eldians are feared
and hated by the world.

165
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:10,062
By people across the sea
whose faces we don't know.

166
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:15,734
But not everyone across the sea
was our enemy.

167
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:22,700
And we found out the world itself
was complex and full of unknowns.

168
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:28,497
By the way, why do you have
dark skin, Onyankopon?

169
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,793
Because our creator thought,

170
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,213
"It's more interesting
with a mix of people."

171
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:42,303
You Subjects of Ymir are the same.
We exist because we were wanted.

172
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,723
Who created us?

173
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,767
The one who gave the Founder Ymir power.

174
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,853
God.

175
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,231
That's what some people believe.

176
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,193
Aren't we free to think what we want?

177
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,783
What the hell is this food?

178
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,744
Is it even edible?

179
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,953
Smells fishy.

180
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,122
You've never had seafood?

181
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,791
Niccolo's a master of Marleyan cooking.

182
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,920
Jerks. If you don't like it, don't eat it.

183
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,047
Eldians like you don't--

184
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,636
So good!

185
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,930
-Hey!
-No fair, Sasha!

186
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:32,269
Niccolo! You're a food genius!

187
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,564
Stop eating like a pig!

188
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,442
I've never had anything like this!

189
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,446
There's plenty, so take your time.

190
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,664
The port will be finished soon!

191
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:56,585
Thanks to the Marleyan engineers,
building it has been quick.

192
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,796
They have surely been cooperative.

193
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:04,176
It went bad at first
since neither side trusted the other.

194
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:11,058
But given enough time, if we set aside
our labels and see each other as people,

195
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,644
we can understand each other.

196
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,857
Armin, have you seen Bertholdt's memories?

197
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,151
What? Yes.

198
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,988
But there's nothing that seems helpful.

199
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,115
There's not much time.

200
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,742
Zeke has less than three years left.

201
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,037
Yes, about that…

202
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:36,125
Do we really want to go along
with Yelena's plan?

203
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,043
What's the problem?

204
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:44,341
Is using the rumbling to threaten
the world the only way to protect Eldians?

205
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:48,429
Then we will be the devils
that terrorize the world.

206
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,600
Before it comes to that, can't we talk?

207
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:56,770
If we can fix Marley
and the world's misconception…

208
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:57,813
"Misconception"?

209
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,482
What "misconception"?

210
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,569
You know, like how we're scary.

211
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:07,239
The world sees us as monsters
who can turn into Titans.

212
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,116
They are not wrong.

213
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,454
There are Marleyans who like us, too.

214
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,496
How many?

215
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,376
Most of the Marleyans
are sitting in prison cells.

216
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,296
But given enough time…

217
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,507
Yes. We need time.

218
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:27,968
That's right.

219
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:32,389
And to buy us that time,
we've got to keep them at bay.

220
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,813
I wonder…

221
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,359
Did we make the right choice?

222
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:49,573
I can't help but think,

223
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,451
"Could there have been some other path?"

224
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:57,706
I thought I understood Eren
better than anyone.

225
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,166
Even Mikasa.

226
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,670
But I don't know anymore.

227
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,797
SCOUT FLEET

228
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,923
FORMED TO INVESTIGATE PARADIS ISLAND

229
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,591
AFTER THE OPERATION TO RETAKE
THE FOUNDING TITAN HAD FAILED

230
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,884
THE FIRST FLEET EMBARKED IN 851

231
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:21,939
Hey! Aren't you a Marleyan?
What the hell are you doing here?

232
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,650
This graveyard is full of people…

233
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,443
-your kind killed!
-Wait!

234
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,779
-Let us take care of this guy!
-Let go!

235
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,532
Sorry. Please.

236
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,702
Marleyans can piss off!

237
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,786
Hey, Niccolo!

238
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,162
Are you okay?

239
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,708
Damn it! Why?

240
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,545
Is Sasha really dead?

241
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,714
Yes.

242
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:51,218
Why? What the hell were you guys doing?

243
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,684
Shot by a kid who sneaked on the airship?

244
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,188
It's too ridiculous to be true.

245
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,693
It was no ordinary girl.
She had been trained.

246
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,529
A Warrior candidate?

247
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,699
I let my guard down. Sorry.

248
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,744
Why are you apologizing to me?

249
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,122
All I did was cook her food.

250
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:27,963
Thanks for letting her eat
so much tasty food, Niccolo.

251
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,092
What do you think about this, Conny?

252
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,847
Sasha and I were like twins.

253
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,310
It feels like half of me is gone.

254
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,230
You're…

255
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,692
You all knew my daughter, didn't you?

256
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,619
Excuse me.

257
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:04,374
I'm just a captive Marleyan,
but I'm allowed to work as a chef.

258
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:09,797
Your daughter loved eating my food
more than anyone else.

259
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,592
So if you ever want to…

260
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,762
please come and eat my food.

261
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,061
On the house, right?

262
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,230
Of course.

263
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,907
You guys are calling it a victory.

264
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,910
Isn't ignorance a scary thing?

265
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:45,249
If I send your dead body to Marley
and reveal your little plot,

266
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,085
your gramps and granny are done for.

267
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:54,424
But if this secret plan of yours is real,
I can wait to chop you up.

268
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,177
Either way works for me.

269
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,514
I appreciate your graciousness.

270
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,434
But don't I get to meet Eren first?

271
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:09,565
Don't be in such a hurry.
We've got the finest hotel for you.

272
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,693
You can stay there and relax for a while.

273
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,533
Hey. Can you please stop glaring at me?

274
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:24,663
This is all of the Titan serum
we stole from Marley.

275
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,666
But you'll have trouble reproducing it.

276
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,628
No, we should manage fine with this much.

277
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:35,424
I only wish we could properly thank you.

278
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:41,263
We owe you so much already.
We were ignorant, but you gave us hope.

279
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:46,435
For us to suspect you,
we're truly no better than devils.

280
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:53,108
For three years, we've done nothing
but show we're friends of the Eldians.

281
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,568
It's unfortunate.

282
00:19:55,194 --> 00:20:00,824
The guns we brought
were meant to give Eldians freedom.

283
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:07,706
I know it's selfish to ask, but can you
overlook our cautiousness for a while?

284
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,335
We have to keep Zeke on a tight leash.

285
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,338
It's fine, Commander Pyxis.

286
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:18,091
We'll dine at the same table again soon.

287
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,721
This is my hotel?

288
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,848
You got a problem with it?

289
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:30,395
It's a forest of giant trees.
I can't think of a better place for you.

290
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,774
Might be lots of fun with ODM gear.

291
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,235
Hey, Captain Levi.

292
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:40,572
Do you think I could show
Gabi and Falco this natural wonder?

293
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,740
Damn it.

294
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:46,745
Whether they see the sights
or not depends on you.

295
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,714
Eren Jaeger!

296
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,343
Eren would have done it alone.

297
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:07,391
Whether we helped him or not,
the worst would have happened anyway.

298
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,229
In any case, we killed a lot of people.

299
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:16,149
The navy, army, and civilians
got dragged into it.

300
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,653
And just like that, all were lost.

301
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,157
But unless that port was destroyed,

302
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:28,495
Marley would have retaliated
and attacked the island.

303
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:34,293
We killed any hope for peace,
but we had no choice.

304
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,504
Just like you guys that day.

305
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,508
Hey, Annie.

306
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,220
Say something, please.

307
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,267
Fight or die.

308
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,520
Win and live.

309
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,530
The only way to win is to fight.

310
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,741
Fight.

311
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,909
Fight!

312
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:47,717
Without any allies on the outside,
they must kill their enemies to live.

313
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,303
Is that the right choice or not?

314
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,556
There's not a soul who knows.

315
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,892
Next episode: "A Sound Argument."
