1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,379
We were abandoned.

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:08,341
That's why we live in a camp
surrounded by walls.

3
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:12,721
Because the blood of devils
runs through us.

4
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:16,433
That's also why your father isn't here.

5
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,769
Your father…

6
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,813
is a Marleyan.

7
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,984
He can't be with us Eldians.

8
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,779
If only we were Marleyans…

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,955
Oh, right.

10
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:40,790
Back then,

11
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:45,378
I strove to be a Warrior
so we could be Marleyans.

12
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,302
Who said you could walk?

13
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:56,056
Run, you filthy seed of swine!

14
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,558
Don't you want to be Honorary Marleyans?

15
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,064
Did you guys hear?

16
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,817
We're attacking Paradis Island
in just a few years.

17
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,235
-What?
-What?

18
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,113
It's almost time for us to inherit Titans!

19
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:16,159
Out of the seven of us,
they are picking six!

20
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,913
Yes! I can finally be a Marleyan!

21
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,248
What? Why are you so excited?

22
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,501
If we have to leave
the worst person out, it will be you.

23
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,627
Excuse me?

24
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,880
-What's your strong point?
-What?

25
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,381
Your strength?

26
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,382
Your brain?

27
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,717
Your aim?

28
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,385
Combat ability?

29
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,512
No.

30
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,891
The only value they see in you
is your loyalty to Marley.

31
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,103
"I'll slaughter the island devils
real good for you, sir!"

32
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,649
Are you making fun of our mission?

33
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,777
Or maybe you're a stray Restorationist?

34
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,820
What?

35
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,905
You are, aren't you?

36
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,157
I'll report you to the commander!

37
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,660
Report this, you little shit!

38
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,787
Do you want some more?

39
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,955
Porco, enough!

40
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,833
Hating the island
doesn't make you special!

41
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,336
Have fun waiting for 13 years alone!

42
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,631
-Damn it!
-Porco!

43
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,383
Let's go, Pieck.

44
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:18,263
Don't cry too long
or the commander will chew me out.

45
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,808
Reiner, I'm sorry.

46
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,771
Stand up, Reiner.

47
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,731
Come on.

48
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:35,071
I'm going to become a Marleyan
and live with my mom and dad.

49
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,073
I can't wait for 13 years.

50
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,450
But it's like he said.

51
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,202
I'm the worst one here.

52
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,705
Porco doesn't make the decision.

53
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:47,125
Besides, loyalty is important.

54
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,334
Right, Annie?

55
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,837
What?

56
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,255
I wasn't listening.

57
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:04,017
-Do you really want that as your goal?
-What?

58
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,853
Thirteen years is all you get.

59
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,273
Thirteen years to be a hero.

60
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,654
If I crush the devils on Paradis,
I'll save the world.

61
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:20,700
Then my parents will be proud
to have me as a son.

62
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,708
I wish something would happen.

63
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,919
Eren! There you are!

64
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,433
Marvelous.

65
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,476
Even better than we expected.

66
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,442
The Female Titan.

67
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,903
Versatility is its biggest strength.

68
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,740
On top of its mobility and endurance,

69
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,827
its hardened strikes
are incredibly destructive.

70
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,332
The range is limited,
but it can call Pure Titans, too.

71
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,001
Leonhart is perfect.

72
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,922
The Armored Titan
specializes in hardening.

73
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:44,927
If it charges in at full speed,
the gates of any wall will crumble.

74
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,806
As Marley's shield
that must withstand attacks,

75
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,392
it suits Braun's perseverance.

76
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,396
The Jaw Titan is an assault weapon.

77
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,733
It's as speedy as it is small,

78
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:02,779
with claws and jaw
that crush nearly everything.

79
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,281
Entrusted to the quick-witted Marcel.

80
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,285
The Beast Titan is as potent as ever.

81
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,955
Though slightly larger
than the other Titans,

82
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,793
its throwing technique
is dreadful on another level.

83
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:21,255
What's more, his blood
seems to have hidden power.

84
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:28,971
The Cart Titan has outstanding endurance,
suitable for long missions.

85
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:34,185
It can be outfitted with different
equipment to extend its usefulness.

86
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,855
Pieck's superior judgment will serve well.

87
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,859
And then, there's the Colossal Titan…

88
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,454
A god of destruction.

89
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,959
Hoover will be able to handle it.

90
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,878
I feel bad for those island devils.

91
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,465
One day, that's going to
show up to kill them.

92
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:09,262
This new Warrior Unit
may outperform their predecessors,

93
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,432
but I question the military's decision.

94
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:17,478
Sending children to retake
the Founding Titan sounds insane to me.

95
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,688
You think?

96
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:23,860
Didn't those children
just crush a nation before our eyes?

97
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,695
This is messed up!

98
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,114
Why was the worst of us chosen?

99
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,699
What did you do?

100
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,285
It seems you're the worst one.

101
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,745
That's all there is to it, Pock.

102
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,914
You little--

103
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,002
Porco! Are you sure
you want to defy the brass?

104
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,211
What?

105
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,384
Reiner.

106
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,094
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,095
What?

108
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,193
Dad!

109
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,278
It's you, right?

110
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:11,157
Mom used to work
in these barracks before I was born!

111
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,494
That's where you met her! Karina Braun!

112
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,912
Look at this!

113
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,748
Mom and I are Honorary Marleyans!

114
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,708
-We can all live--
-Bloody hell!

115
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,044
Did that woman send you here?

116
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,712
To get revenge on me?

117
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,088
Shit!

118
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,965
Now her kid is a Warrior?

119
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,636
If they find out where you're from,
my family is screwed!

120
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,513
You're going to get me hanged!

121
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,515
I'm running the hell away!

122
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,060
Away from you and your damn Eldian mother!

123
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,686
Reiner!

124
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,688
Reiner!

125
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,816
I'll be waiting for you!

126
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,401
That's right.

127
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,529
Even without a father,

128
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,823
I'm still the chosen Warrior
of the Armored Titan.

129
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:57,703
I'll save everyone from the island devils
and be the world's hero.

130
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,799
We didn't cover much ground tonight.

131
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,093
We can't do much about the clouds.

132
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:16,931
Will the King really not use
the Founding Titan,

133
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,100
even if we break the wall?

134
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,060
What's the use of asking now?

135
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,229
Trust Marley's research.

136
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,856
That's right. We can't turn back.

137
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,527
Tomorrow, we reach the wall and then…

138
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,490
What?

139
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,618
Are you having second thoughts
about killing the devils?

140
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,620
Have you forgotten what they have done?

141
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:45,793
We're the world's chosen Warriors
sent to punish the island devils!

142
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,756
-I'm sorry.
-What?

143
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,508
Reiner, I'm sorry.

144
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,762
You were never meant to be
chosen as a Warrior.

145
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,684
I talked you up and criticized my brother

146
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,519
to influence their decision.

147
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,896
What?

148
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,981
I…

149
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,567
just wanted to protect my brother.

150
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,446
I'm sorry, Reiner.

151
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,405
I'm sorry!

152
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,411
Why…

153
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,539
are you apologizing?

154
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,981
Bertholdt…

155
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,358
Annie…

156
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,984
Marcel…

157
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,278
They got eaten!

158
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,573
They got eaten because of me!

159
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,075
And I'll be next!

160
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,411
This is where I'm going to die!

161
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,000
Not bad.

162
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,627
This is a first.

163
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,671
You actually beat me…

164
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,422
in a long-distance race.

165
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,423
What?

166
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,925
If we…

167
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,260
took out that Titan,

168
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,638
we wouldn't have lost Jaw.

169
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,681
Shit!

170
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,184
Now Marcel is gone for good.

171
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:29,271
They said there wouldn't be
Titans this far out!

172
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,439
We've got to go home.

173
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,440
What?

174
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,567
Let's find Jaw and leave.

175
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,195
They would have changed back to human.

176
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,950
Besides, without Marcel to lead,
this mission is doomed.

177
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,453
Wait.

178
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,455
We can't…

179
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,665
We can't!

180
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,084
We can't go home!

181
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,086
We've got to continue the mission!

182
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,922
Oh, right.

183
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:59,844
If we go back now,
you'll just get eaten by the next Warrior.

184
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,304
Not that I give a shit.

185
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,349
-You think only I will?
-What?

186
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,853
That only I will get the blame
for running away?

187
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,648
You guys are that certain
you won't get eaten, too?

188
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,943
Catching Jaw won't be easy either.

189
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:21,198
If they used its power and ran,
our Titans could never catch up.

190
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,409
They can't control it
right after becoming--

191
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,287
You had no problem controlling
the Colossal Titan immediately!

192
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:31,000
Anyway, we're doomed at this rate!

193
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,295
Without the Founding Titan,
there's no going home!

194
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:40,176
Back there, if you were a fraction
as calm as you are now,

195
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,304
we wouldn't have lost Marcel or Jaw.

196
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:48,267
But you've got no problem intimidating us
to save your own ass, right?

197
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,021
How about you come clean to Magath?

198
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,607
Tell him, "It's all my fault!"

199
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,859
Honorary Marleyan, my ass!

200
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,444
Chosen Warrior, my ass!

201
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,904
Marleyans! Eldians!

202
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,238
They are all liars!

203
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,532
Everyone only thinks about themselves!

204
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,869
I'm no different!
I've got to get home alive!

205
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,288
If you feel guilty, just die!

206
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,333
Take all the blame and die!

207
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,848
Reiner is dead.

208
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,768
If we need Marcel,

209
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,728
then I'll be Marcel.

210
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,232
Please stop this.

211
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,487
This is the only way
we'll be able to go back home!

212
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,239
Let's go back…

213
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,740
together…

214
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,909
to our hometown!

215
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,476
What?

216
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,938
I wanted to be a Warrior.

217
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:21,277
I thought I could make my mom's wish
come true and we'd live with my father.

218
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,903
But…

219
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,115
I had a father
who didn't want any part of us.

220
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,994
My mom had a dream
she knew would never come true.

221
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,957
I should never have been chosen.
I should have died today.

222
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,544
Why did he apologize?

223
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,880
Why did he save someone like me?

224
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,842
No! I'm not ready for this to end!

225
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:49,555
I still don't understand anything!

226
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,979
Where am I?

227
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,772
Inside Wall Rose.

228
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,650
Annie.

229
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,777
Bertholdt.

230
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,779
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,364
Marcel…

232
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,576
I'll be the Warrior I should have been.

233
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,536
You!

234
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,914
What the hell did you come here for?

235
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,917
To save humanity!

236
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,834
WARRIOR CANDIDATES

237
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,127
A UNIT OF CHILD SOLDIERS
CONSISTING OF ELDIAN "DEVILS"

238
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,712
UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE MARLEY ARMY,
THEY UNDERGO HARSH TRAINING

239
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,922
ONLY ELDIAN "DEVILS"
CAN INHERIT THE NINE TITANS

240
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,344
I lived in Wall Maria,
deep in the southeast mountains.

241
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,512
It happened at dawn.

242
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:35,684
The animals were all stirred up
and I heard a strange rumbling.

243
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,271
Thinking they were footsteps,
I opened the window.

244
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:45,152
The rest is a blur,
but I ran away on my horse.

245
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:49,573
Leaving behind three kids
about the same age as you guys.

246
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,336
Hey, missy.

247
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:06,715
You've got good taste
in men to tail a geezer like me.

248
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,718
I was born at an inn.

249
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:14,306
My mom, who works there,
talks about my father so much.

250
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,724
I know that it's you.

251
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,810
Well, that's really touching.

252
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,729
If you want a hug from Daddy,
put your hands up.

253
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,732
How are you sure it's not you?

254
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,901
I made a promise to my sister.

255
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,988
This joke of yours isn't making me laugh.

256
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,491
You're so mean, Dad!

257
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,707
Hey, now.

258
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,584
Having a rebellious phase, are we?

259
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,088
That's a new one.

260
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,590
Are his legs saying
it's going to snow today?

261
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,510
No. That's the clear skies position.

262
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:55,014
Just call it hail,
or you'll be late for muster.

263
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,182
Wake up, Bertholdt!

264
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,937
While you two snoozed
after playing with your friends,

265
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,773
I was busy crawling around
the capital's sewers.

266
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,776
If he's around, this is my limit.

267
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,279
Your limit…

268
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,782
Let's take what we know back to Marley.

269
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,660
They will be happy to hear anything.

270
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,787
Do you honestly think that?

271
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,791
Not if that's all we have to show
after five years.

272
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,794
Then what do you want us to do?

273
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,047
Destroy Wall Rose.

274
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,051
It's the only way we can
smoke out the Founding Titan.

275
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,179
A lot of your friends are going to die.

276
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,098
I keep telling you.

277
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,517
They are not friends, they are devils.

278
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,187
But gaining their trust can't hurt.

279
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,023
And frankly, your aloof behavior isn't--

280
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,357
I'm going to barf.

281
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,777
Can you move your face away from mine?

282
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,489
I bet you're exhausted.

283
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,617
Sorry for always laying the burden on you.

284
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,203
Let's call it a day.

285
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,169
I keep having the same dream.

286
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,714
I dream about the guy
who hung himself in the fields.

287
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:17,679
Why did he tell us that story
right before he hung himself?

288
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,439
Eren, take a break.

289
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,941
You're going to die.

290
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,192
Shit!

291
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,654
Reiner, how do you do it?

292
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,449
How can I be more like you and Mikasa?

293
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:42,663
At this rate,
I'll die without doing a damn thing!

294
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,629
Just do what you've got to do.

295
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,298
Keep moving forward.

296
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,635
That's all we can do.

297
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,388
Yes. You're right.

298
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,184
Aren't you going to
drive out every last Titan?

299
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,562
I know you can do it.

300
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,871
Shit!

301
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,373
I can't let this go on!

302
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,757
That's right.

303
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,927
I still have those guys.

304
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,604
The hospital…

305
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,314
Hey!

306
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,947
Well, I guess you're recovering well.

307
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,200
You're good enough to talk now.

308
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,284
Kind of.

309
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,872
I'm here for emotional trauma,
but it's a lie.

310
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:07,831
What?

311
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,210
I said I lost my memory and can't go home,

312
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,420
but I just don't want to.

313
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,007
It would be hard to face my family now.

314
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,801
Will you snitch on me?

315
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,179
I wouldn't do that.

316
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,848
You're hurt.

317
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,100
Is it from your Warrior training?

318
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,687
Yes, but I won't become one.

319
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,565
Another candidate is so talented,

320
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,817
I don't even stand a chance.

321
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,737
-That's good to hear.
-What?

322
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,697
You're a good guy.

323
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,908
I hope you live a long life.

324
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:48,497
But I don't want them to be a Warrior.

325
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,873
Why not?

326
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,003
Is the other candidate a girl?

327
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,839
She's famous around here.

328
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,884
She did incredible things in the war.

329
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,097
Everyone's saying
she should be the next Armored Titan.

330
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:11,186
But since I'm powerless,
I can't do a damn thing about it.

331
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,317
Every day I'm here, I think,

332
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,737
"Why did it ever come to this?"

333
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,490
Damaged minds and bodies…

334
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,993
Their freedom taken away…

335
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,245
Even losing themselves.

336
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:33,667
If people knew it would come to this,
nobody would go to war.

337
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,963
But most people are pushed by something,

338
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,090
forced to march into hell.

339
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,593
That "something" wasn't their choice.

340
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:47,014
Their situation or others made them do it.

341
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:53,353
But people who push their own backs
see a different kind of hell.

342
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:57,441
They can see something beyond hell.

343
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,152
It might be hope.

344
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,362
It may even be another hell.

345
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:07,909
Only those who keep moving forward
will ever know.

346
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:47,134
Magath sorts out the military
for the Tybur family to tell the truth.

347
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:52,889
As the festival enlivens the city,
an unexpected surprise awaits Reiner.

348
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,934
Next episode, "From One Hand to Another."
