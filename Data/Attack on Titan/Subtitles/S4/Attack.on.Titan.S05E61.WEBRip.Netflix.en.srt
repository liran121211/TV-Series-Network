1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:06,131
We wasted four years squabbling
over a peninsula's sovereignty,

2
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:12,053
and our two main battle Titans were
nearly shredded by the enemy fleet.

3
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:17,976
"Human ingenuity surpasses
and shatters Marley's Armor at last."

4
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:23,732
The press from other nations
is commending the Mid-East Allied Forces.

5
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:27,861
Does this sound like a victory
for Marley to you?

6
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,697
Magath, do you care to comment?

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,534
General, I'm afraid the time has come.

8
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:38,621
That is, humanity has eclipsed
the Power of the Titans.

9
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:44,002
While we've been relying heavily
on Titans and colonial expansion,

10
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:48,673
other nations have been developing
weapons to counter us.

11
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:52,886
As a result, our strategy
has come back to bite us on the ass.

12
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:59,309
For the time being, our Titans remain
unrivaled when it comes to land battles.

13
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:05,857
However, if aircraft keep advancing at
this rate, bombs will soon fall like rain.

14
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:12,989
All while Titans, the devils of the earth,
can do nothing but look up and watch.

15
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,455
Do we not have any Titans with wings?

16
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,918
General, I'm trying to say
that the era of Titans--

17
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,169
I know.

18
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:30,381
In the near future,
we will lose our initiative in war.

19
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,884
No, perhaps we already have.

20
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:37,388
Though once the heroes
who crushed the Eldian devils,

21
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,474
look at what we've become.

22
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,143
If I may, General?

23
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,688
Requesting permission to give counsel.

24
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,942
Zeke, the Boy Wonder. Go ahead.

25
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,029
We should resume
the Paradis Island Operation

26
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,448
and recover the Founding Titan.

27
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:03,623
As Commander Magath was saying,
Marley needs to develop better weapons.

28
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:07,877
However, the world
will not stand by and wait.

29
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:13,049
Our military needs time
to completely restructure.

30
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,095
But for that, the newspapers
of the world must read this,

31
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:21,724
"Marley Occupies Paradis
and Wields the Power of All Titans."

32
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,981
You have one year left
in your term, correct?

33
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:34,195
Yes, and I'm concerned that Colt can't
inherit the full power of the Beast Titan.

34
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,116
I see.

35
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:43,872
In your last year, you wish to redeem
yourself for your defeat four years ago?

36
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,082
That is correct.

37
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:51,212
The sick exploits of Grisha Jaeger
should be brought to an end

38
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,966
by none other than me, his former son.

39
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,612
I'm sorry I bashed you
to further my agenda, Colt.

40
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,739
Don't be. You were amazing.

41
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:46,077
I can't believe that an Eldian
is being heard by the general!

42
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:51,249
There hasn't been a Beast
like you in its history.

43
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,127
Sometimes it reminds me
of the Founding Titan.

44
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,171
Why are you so special?

45
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,216
It's not like you have any royal blood.

46
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,176
Who knows?

47
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,971
I guess I'll be dead
before we figure it out.

48
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,306
Oh, right.

49
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,311
But when you inherit my memories,
you'll find out my big secret.

50
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,813
Secret? What is it?

51
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,232
The special way I wipe my ass.

52
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,443
I hope you don't tell anyone.

53
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,445
Too late. I want a report.

54
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,946
-Commander!
-Commander!

55
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,574
Everything down to the hair on your ass.

56
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,410
Do you think Eldians get privacy?

57
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,786
No, sir!

58
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,704
I see.

59
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,710
You can conquer Paradis in a year?

60
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:39,672
It's more like
I only have one year left to try.

61
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:45,887
These past three years, every scout ship
we've sent to Paradis hasn't returned.

62
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,723
Zeke, what do you think of that?

63
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:55,813
Considering 32 ships were sunk, I can't
imagine a single Titan was responsible.

64
00:05:55,897 --> 00:06:00,109
At least two Titans,
including Eren Jaeger,

65
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,820
must have blocked their escape.

66
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,363
I agree.

67
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,117
If we attack the island,
our ships will need support.

68
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,118
Yes.

69
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:13,247
But it's more than their Titans
that pose a threat.

70
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:19,962
Wait--

71
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:30,014
It seemed like you were having
a good dream, so I didn't wake you.

72
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:34,185
I still haven't thanked you
for back then, Galliard.

73
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,437
Thank you.

74
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,481
Don't thank me.

75
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,401
If I inherited the Armored Titan
nine years ago,

76
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,529
this wouldn't have happened.

77
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:50,660
My brother wouldn't have protected you
and been eaten by a Titan, either.

78
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,995
You saw Marcel's memories?

79
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:58,084
No, but I learned enough
from that girl before me, Ymir.

80
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,005
What an impressive name
for such a pitiful woman.

81
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,636
Isn't it thanks to her
that we got my brother's Jaw back?

82
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,055
Yes, that's right.

83
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,517
What the hell were you doing
on that island?

84
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,520
Getting saved by someone new every day?

85
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,855
Yes.

86
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,816
I saw how you acted through her memories.

87
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,151
What's with that?

88
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,529
Pretending to be a reliable guy?

89
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,282
I would say you were imitating my brother!

90
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:34,203
Pock, let's not pick on people
who just took cannons to the face.

91
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,456
Quit calling me that, Pieck.

92
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,040
Are you all right?

93
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,127
It's been two months
since I've been a human.

94
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,255
I kind of forgot the whole bipedal thing.

95
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,676
By the way, Reiner,
you ought to see Gabi and the others.

96
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,511
They are worried about you.

97
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,221
I think I will.

98
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,562
I'm exhausted.

99
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,482
It feels like ages since I've seen you.

100
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,108
Really?

101
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,652
Even though
we're always fighting together?

102
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,489
Well, we might not have to for a while.

103
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,575
Let's hope so.

104
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,871
-This way.
-Sure.

105
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,835
Hey, if Titans lose
their usefulness in battle,

106
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,089
what will happen
to the Warrior Unit and us Eldians?

107
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,637
-A guy that lives near me…
-Mr. Braun will be fine.

108
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,472
-said the sea is so salty…
-I know.

109
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,016
-because he pisses in it.
-What? That's…

110
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:44,023
They are probably enemy soldiers
that survived the Pure Titan attack.

111
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,487
Once they get home, they will talk about
how inhumane Titan warfare is!

112
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,615
It will just make things
even worse for us Eldians!

113
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,786
"People of the world!
Let us kill the Subjects of Ymir!"

114
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,207
Shit!

115
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,667
-Shit!
-Cut it out, Udo.

116
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,670
Don't beat up the city.

117
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,922
Reiner!

118
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,132
Is it okay for you to walk?

119
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,969
Yes. Are you guys all right?

120
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,720
-Gabi.
-Yes!

121
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,847
-Udo.
-I guess.

122
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,266
Zofia.

123
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,350
Same old.

124
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,602
Falco.

125
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,188
-Hello.
-Hey!

126
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,983
They said we're going back to Liberio!

127
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,901
Let's walk around until then!

128
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:29,860
Hey!

129
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,320
We never get chances like this!

130
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,614
Shouldn't Mr. Braun be resting?

131
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,370
I'm all right. Don't worry.

132
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,372
You go home and rest!

133
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,873
I'm coming, too!

134
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,917
Hold up, Gabi.

135
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,211
Commander Magath
said that's not a place kids--

136
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,839
But I just saw him walking that way.

137
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,843
You worrywart.

138
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,724
Wait!

139
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,850
What?

140
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,608
You kids are too young for that store.

141
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,484
Oh, man!

142
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:19,660
Did you guys witness
the bravery of our Eldian goddess?

143
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:24,790
Gabi took on the armored train
in place of 800 Eldian soldiers!

144
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,084
Man, Colt! You stink of booze!

145
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,879
Why did you do it, you big idiot?

146
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,505
Comrades!

147
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,426
Do you have any idea
why this idiot risked her life?

148
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,845
Well, I do!

149
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:43,184
She did it to save
all your asses in the Eldian Unit!

150
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:49,857
-Yes!
-I'll go shut them up.

151
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,526
-Let them have it.
-Gabi!

152
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,528
-Just this one night.
-Gabi!

153
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,530
-Gabi!
-Gabi!

154
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,409
-Gabi!
-Me!

155
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,578
-They are lifting her up again.
-Me!

156
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,414
-Gabi!
-They shouldn't let my brother drink.

157
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,292
-And Gabi gets carried away too easily.
-Me!

158
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:14,090
Still, it looks like she will be the one
who inherits the Armored Titan.

159
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:15,883
Yes.

160
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,553
The girl who adores you
will inherit your Titan

161
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,680
and will live until she's 27.

162
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,352
If cannons don't shred her first, that is.

163
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,355
Are you fine with that?

164
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,317
What did you say?

165
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,570
Are you insulting the honor
of inheriting one of the Nine?

166
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:43,202
If I report this, you and your whole
family will become Titan weapons.

167
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:47,498
Wait! Let me rephrase what I said!

168
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:53,087
I, Falco Grice, hope to be freed from
the evil blood of Ymir and my ancestors!

169
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,214
I pledge my life to Marley!

170
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:59,218
And what about the honor
of inheriting one of the Nine?

171
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,430
I would be proud
to be an Honorary Marleyan

172
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:06,892
and be given the chance to display
my loyalty to our motherland!

173
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,520
Do you want to inherit the Armored Titan?

174
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,398
Gabi!

175
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,526
-Thank you!
-Gabi!

176
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,320
-Gabi!
-The one who should inherit it is me!

177
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,238
-Gabi!
-Yes.

178
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,156
What?

179
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:26,162
You have to rescue Gabi
from the dark future that awaits us.

180
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:29,832
ELDIAN ARMBAND

181
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,333
USED TO DIFFERENTIATE
ELDIAN "DEVILS" FROM OTHER RACES

182
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,460
HIGHER CLASSES MAY HAVE DIFFERENT COLORS

183
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,919
ALSO VARY IF AN ELDIAN
IS IN THE MILITARY OR A CIVILIAN

184
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,807
We're back!

185
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,602
We made it back alive!

186
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,688
It's our beloved hometown, Liberio!

187
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,608
-We're home!
-Gabi.

188
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,194
Could you please tone it down?

189
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,778
It hurts.

190
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,073
You should have known
you can't hold your booze.

191
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,119
Who's the one who gave him the drinks?

192
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,747
He looked like he wanted some.

193
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,332
Unbelievable.

194
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,919
How dare you spew
Pieck's kindness all over the train?

195
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,546
We should have shut them up last night.

196
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,759
I heard they kept hoisting you up.

197
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,302
It's because of Colt!

198
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,470
I think it's fine.

199
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:29,475
You deserved a bit of fun.
What you did was impressive.

200
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,185
Pieck!

201
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,356
Vice-Captain Braun…

202
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,984
What if he's thinking the same as me,

203
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,530
and he wants us Eldians
to be free from war?

204
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,825
Can I trust him?

205
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,085
See you later.

206
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,254
Take it easy and enjoy the break.

207
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,382
Not me! It's back to training tomorrow!

208
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,634
Trying to boost your grades?

209
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,052
Give me a break.

210
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,554
I am not!

211
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,888
Hey, you two.

212
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,307
Don't push yourselves too hard.

213
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,028
Dad!

214
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,909
Zeke.

215
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,453
Grandpa! Grandma!

216
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,955
I'm home!

217
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,208
You achieved great things, Zeke.

218
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,419
No, not yet.

219
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,045
Colt! Falco!

220
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,088
Colt!

221
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,174
Dad! Mom!

222
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,260
-Gabi!
-Gabi!

223
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,347
Reiner.

224
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,225
You must be tired.

225
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,060
Come home and rest.

226
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,520
Mom.

227
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,064
I think I will.

228
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,569
Go on ahead!

229
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,113
For crying out loud!

230
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,073
Do you not know how to stand?

231
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,534
Are they injured soldiers, Mr. Koslow?

232
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,329
What? Stay out of the way, you brat.

233
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,624
They are Eldians with emotional trauma.

234
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,208
Even our guys?

235
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:22,004
It's from digging trenches
on the front lines too long.

236
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,715
All those bullets and bombs do it to you.

237
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,094
Boom!

238
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,307
Look! They fell over again!

239
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,226
Are you okay? It's all right!

240
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,313
Your armband is on the wrong arm.

241
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,231
It's okay.

242
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,192
I'm sure you'll get better.

243
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,862
You don't have to fight anymore.

244
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,323
-Boom!
-Oh, my!

245
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:53,702
Just like I planned, I blew
the armored train right off the tracks!

246
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,537
It actually worked!

247
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,749
But as I ran away,
they fired a machine gun at me!

248
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,293
And just before I ate lead,

249
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,922
Galliard protected me with the Jaw Titan!

250
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,632
Amazing, Gabi!

251
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:10,427
You and your bravery
saved a bunch of our soldiers!

252
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,972
You're the savior of Eldia!

253
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,892
-I'm so proud of you!
-Yes.

254
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:17,851
Reiner.

255
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,188
Do you think Gabi will become a Warrior?

256
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,272
Yes.

257
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:26,610
It's almost a given
that she will inherit the Armored Titan.

258
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,612
That's good to hear.

259
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,532
I can't believe our family
would have two Warriors.

260
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,117
I'm so proud.

261
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:37,454
If only those island devils disappeared,

262
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,791
we Eldians could finally be happy.

263
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,876
But, Reiner,

264
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,089
even you barely escaped
from the island devils, right?

265
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,049
Don't, Dad!

266
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:53,804
He survived on that island
of rotten devils for five years!

267
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:58,809
Even if it wasn't classified,
it's stuff he wouldn't want to talk about.

268
00:16:58,892 --> 00:16:59,893
You're right.

269
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,938
Forgive me, my nephew.

270
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,858
No, I can talk about it.

271
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,194
I infiltrated their military.

272
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,991
Every last one of them
was a savage, heartless devil.

273
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:18,537
During the entrance ceremony,
one of them started eating a potato.

274
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,750
The instructor yelled at them,
but they hardly seemed to care.

275
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,002
Said they stole it
because it looked tasty.

276
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:29,339
Realizing they had crossed the line,

277
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,717
they said they would share
half of it with him.

278
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,305
But the piece of potato they offered
wasn't even close to half.

279
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,516
Being considerate
doesn't even cross their minds.

280
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,936
They are truly beyond all help.

281
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,232
There was an idiot
who forgot why he went to the bathroom.

282
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,694
An insincere jerk
who only thought about himself.

283
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,864
An uptight oaf
who only cared what others thought.

284
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:59,286
A single-minded fool who charged ahead
and the chumps who followed him.

285
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,955
There were all sorts of people there.

286
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,124
And we were there, too.

287
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,545
My days there were true hell.

288
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,512
I've said too much.

289
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,138
Forget it.

290
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,100
What do you mean, "all sorts of people"?

291
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,684
They are bad people, right?

292
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,937
That's right, Gabi.

293
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,899
Those island devils
turned our world into hell.

294
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:34,154
There's no knowing when they will attack
with giant Titans and flatten the world.

295
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:39,118
It's up to good Eldians like us
to make sure they never do.

296
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,077
Right.

297
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,083
Those who left us and fled
to the island deserved to be punished.

298
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,710
They are the ones who abandoned us.

299
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,428
What's wrong, Gabi?

300
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,847
You seem down.

301
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,891
Aunt Karina is worried about you.

302
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:07,271
She says you changed
after coming back from the island alone.

303
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,733
Her 12-year-old son came back a grown man.

304
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,652
You can't really blame her.

305
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,530
It feels like you're lying.

306
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,740
Lying? About what?

307
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,160
I don't know,

308
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,453
but I think Aunt Karina does.

309
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,539
-Right.
-I heard it was a soldier.

310
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,499
That's awful.

311
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,752
Good morning.

312
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,880
Is everyone here?

313
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:37,092
It's not every day we meet
in the war chief's room.

314
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,886
Where's the brass?

315
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,096
Not in this room.

316
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,599
Can't we just meet for some tea?

317
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,641
Right.

318
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,394
Now then…

319
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:52,274
The last battle made it clear
that normal weapons will overtake Titans

320
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,151
in the near future.

321
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:59,573
The weaker Marley becomes,
the more the Eldian race is threatened.

322
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,909
Our existence is in danger.

323
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,286
To rectify this,

324
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:08,790
Marley must obtain
the Founding Titan and Paradis' resources.

325
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:14,671
The world must be strongly reminded
of the threat that island poses.

326
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,174
To tell that story, we need a narrator.

327
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,178
The Tybur family will fulfill that role.

328
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,431
The family holding the War Hammer Titan?

329
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:29,353
It's said the Tyburs have never sent
the War Hammer Titan to enemy soil.

330
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,690
They are influential abroad
for driving away King Fritz

331
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,651
during the Great Titan War.

332
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,946
The world will listen to them.

333
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,823
That's Pieck for you! Precisely!

334
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:46,328
But the Tyburs have been living
the life in their huge mansions.

335
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:50,791
Why come out of the woodwork now
and pretend to be heroes?

336
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:55,837
I know how you feel, but the Tyburs
are concerned about Marley, too.

337
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,339
But we--

338
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,801
If it saves our motherland,
Marley, I'll be grateful.

339
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:04,221
Our Warrior Unit can cooperate
with the Tyburs

340
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,724
and serve as the backbone
for restoring Marley.

341
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,268
Indeed.

342
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,354
Here in Liberio,
there will be a festival soon.

343
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,522
Festival?

344
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:19,027
VIPs from abroad will be invited to hear
an announcement from the Tyburs,

345
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:23,365
"Within a year,
we'll control Paradis Island."

346
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:27,869
The fate of Marley and all Eldians
rests in this plan.

347
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,871
It cannot fail.

348
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:34,876
For the future of our motherland, Marley,
we must join our hearts as one.

349
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:41,466
Galliard seems to have some complaints,
but he always gets the job done.

350
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,261
If that's all they're saying,
I'm not concerned.

351
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,306
