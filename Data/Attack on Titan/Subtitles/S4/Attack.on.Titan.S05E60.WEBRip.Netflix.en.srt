1
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,553
Hey.

2
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:18,643
It's dangerous here.

3
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,690
Fly away…

4
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,445
somewhere far away.

5
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,113
Falco!

6
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,322
What?

7
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,533
-What is my brother doing here?
-Good!

8
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:34,826
You're still talking!

9
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:35,994
Colt!

10
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,496
Time to run! Hold on!

11
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,341
Falco!

12
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,017
Colt? Status report?

13
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,480
It was a direct hit.

14
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,694
The Eldian Unit at the front
got blown away.

15
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,946
And the trench?

16
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,116
It's hopeless! We can't dig any farther!

17
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,078
We can't? You're calling the shots?

18
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,330
An Eldian, giving orders?

19
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,416
Watch your tone with
Commander Magath, you mutt!

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,419
But at this rate…

21
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,297
Falco, are you drunk?

22
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,341
He must have hit his head badly.

23
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:35,428
Do you remember this war
we have been in for four years?

24
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,723
Who are you guys?

25
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,476
Wait. What?

26
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:45,480
Wasn't I flying around
with a sword just now?

27
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,565
Like, whoosh!

28
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,150
And there were Titans that I--

29
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:54,155
I guess I'll just have to explain
everything from the start.

30
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,075
Listen up and listen carefully, Falco.

31
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,830
This battle is the climax of a war
that has lasted four years.

32
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,750
If we can take out Fort Slava…

33
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,002
Well, technically,

34
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:12,090
if we sink the Mid-East Allied Forces
fleet in its port,

35
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:16,427
it will spell victory for Marley
and end the war.

36
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:21,850
But unless we take Fort Slava
sitting on the high ground,

37
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,435
it's hopeless to attack the port.

38
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,857
Why can't the Marley fleet just do it?

39
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,485
Seriously, Zofia?
You have faith in the fleet?

40
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,612
It took those imbeciles four years

41
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,364
-to control the seas!
-Oh, god!

42
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,824
-And guess what?
-Oh, my god!

43
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:41,035
-They lost half their damn ships doing it!
-It hurts!

44
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,581
Now they are telling us
they are too chicken

45
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,791
to attack until we take the fort?

46
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,294
Screw them all! They are pricks!

47
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,964
Udo, you're going to
squeeze Falco's head off.

48
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,883
Oh, my! Sorry!

49
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,177
So what's the deal?

50
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,514
Why did they send us
Warrior candidates to the front lines?

51
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,975
To judge us, obviously.

52
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:08,146
To pick which one of us
will be the next Warrior.

53
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,442
The time is coming.

54
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,863
Commander Magath chose
the front lines to be our final test.

55
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,407
He knows what's on the horizon.

56
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,453
The plan to conquer Paradis
needs a main player…

57
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,664
The successor of the Armored Titan!

58
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,268
The Armored Titan…

59
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,355
I wonder which one of us it will be.

60
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,776
Really, Gabi?

61
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,697
It sounds to me like you're saying
none of us come close to you.

62
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,741
Because you don't, right?

63
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,244
Well, Gabi does have us beat.

64
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,788
As far as our grades go.

65
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,499
No. There's more to it than grades, Udo.

66
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,126
I keep telling you.

67
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,130
The difference between us
is that I'm prepared.

68
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,591
To shoulder the fate of us Eldians

69
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,094
and to slaughter that island of devils,

70
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,638
who have done nothing but make us suffer!

71
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,974
I'm going to win this battle

72
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:55,021
and prove that the Eldians left
in this world are good Eldians!

73
00:05:55,104 --> 00:06:00,026
I refuse to lose until I free everyone
from the internment zone!

74
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,532
Well, what exactly are you doing?

75
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,118
Pretty cool, right?

76
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,329
It won't work, Commander Magath!

77
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:17,752
We can't destroy the railroad without
the machine gun slaughtering us first.

78
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,297
They've got soldiers
along every inch of the trench.

79
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,385
To top it off, the fort can
bombard us whenever they want.

80
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:29,806
If we stay here too long,
they will just shower us with shells!

81
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,184
Do you have a better idea, Colt?

82
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,188
We should let Jaw and Cart loose.

83
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,400
Galliard and Pieck will get it done.

84
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,070
They will wipe out the trench
and bunker in a flash.

85
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,071
No.

86
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,825
If we play our cards wrong, we lose.

87
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,453
Commander Magath, "that" showed up.

88
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,330
What's "that"?

89
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,749
That.

90
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,918
An armored train.

91
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,338
It's equipped with
four massive cannons in total.

92
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,342
They are the Allied Forces'
new weapon, Anti-Titan Artillery.

93
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:12,765
If one of those 150mm rounds hits
a Titan, it will kill it in a single hit.

94
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,268
Even one of the Nine.

95
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,521
But both of our Titans
are incredibly fast.

96
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,648
The odds of hitting their nape--

97
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:21,941
And if they did?

98
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,654
We would lose a Titan and a Warrior,

99
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:30,241
with no guarantee
that we would get their powers back.

100
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,534
That's right.

101
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:36,372
Just like our plan nine years ago
to retake the Founding Titan

102
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,001
that resulted in us losing
the Colossal Titan and Female Titan.

103
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:46,299
The perceived hit to Marley's
military might is what sparked this war,

104
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,260
putting the Paradis Island Operation
on hold.

105
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,473
What is it that makes
our motherland, Marley, so great?

106
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,100
The Power of the Titans.

107
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,143
Correct.

108
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:00,104
Our nation won't last
if we keep losing them.

109
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,524
The Power of the Titans is absolute,

110
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,776
and it must always remain that way.

111
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,280
Prepare the Eldian Unit for attack!

112
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,908
-Yes, sir!
-Commander Magath! But that's--

113
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,035
What's the matter, Eldian?

114
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:18,623
Are you not Warriors
who swore loyalty to Marley?

115
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,503
This is a chance for the 800 Eldians here

116
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,798
to serve our motherland with honor.

117
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,806
All creatures drink of joy
at nature's breast…

118
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,684
Everyone, up! Prepare to attack!

119
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,522
Come on! Stand up!

120
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,065
Eldians!

121
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:50,196
Your mission is to assault
and destroy the enemy railroad!

122
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,117
The suicide squad will rush the bunker
and disable the machine gun!

123
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,619
Listen up!

124
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,706
Let your actions purge
the disgrace of being spawn of the devil!

125
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,253
This is your chance to be honored
by our great motherland, Marley!

126
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,505
Prove yourselves worthy!

127
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,756
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

128
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,426
You Warrior candidates are to stand by.

129
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:18,599
The 800-strong Eldian Unit
must destroy the rail at whatever cost.

130
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,104
As long as that armored train
is patrolling the fort,

131
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:27,024
the Armored Titan and Beast Titan
can't do what they came for.

132
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,068
But…

133
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,153
Colt.

134
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,406
As the chosen successor
of the Beast Titan,

135
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,993
learn what it means to lead already.

136
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,588
Perfect. We can destroy the train, too.

137
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,132
Please, let me take a shot at it.

138
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,049
What?

139
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,175
Surprise!

140
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,680
If you will let me, I can disable
the armored train all on my own!

141
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,933
Hey, Gabi!

142
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:05,521
How much do you think Marley has spent
training you all these years?

143
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,439
Hell no.

144
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:07,857
It's true.

145
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,027
I am exceptional
compared to Falco and the others.

146
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:15,573
There may never be another Warrior
as talented as I am.

147
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,951
Not to mention one this cute.

148
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:24,582
But if I succeed, we won't lose
the whole unit of 800 Eldians!

149
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,584
And if you fail?

150
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:32,089
You lose just one promising candidate
and seven hand grenades.

151
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:41,682
If you think I'm more valuable than
800 Eldian soldiers, I totally understand.

152
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,227
You love me so much
that you would rather sacrifice

153
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,480
the lives of 800 soldiers over me--

154
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,856
Fine.

155
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:50,858
Go ahead.

156
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,861
-Gabi, don't--
-I swear!

157
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:59,367
I will prove to you that I'm worthy
of inheriting the Armored Titan!

158
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,830
What are you doing?

159
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,500
For this to succeed,

160
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,504
please allow me to remove my armband.

161
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,005
Very well.

162
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,015
Hey, someone's coming this way.

163
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,894
It's a woman.

164
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,270
Girl, actually.

165
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,147
I think she's surrendering.

166
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,482
No, wait.

167
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,067
She might be an Eldian.

168
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,653
It looks like something's wrong with her.

169
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,905
She's dragging her leg.

170
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,493
What if she is an Eldian?

171
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,161
Shoot her before she turns into a Titan.

172
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,579
Screw that.

173
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,540
If you want to shoot her, you do it!

174
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,459
Shit.

175
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,924
What the…

176
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,562
Wait.

177
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,649
Wait for it!

178
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,571
Wait!

179
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,905
She isn't moving.

180
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,449
Who cares? Shoot her!

181
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,707
Now is my chance!

182
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,551
She really did it!

183
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,928
Galliard! Hurry up!

184
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,811
Damn it! You Marleyan cowards!

185
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,190
This is why you bastards…

186
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,693
all deserve to die!

187
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,781
Gabi!

188
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,782
Falco, don't!

189
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,927
Galliard!

190
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,886
What?

191
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,153
The armored train has been disabled.

192
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,073
We'll now commence the airborne assault.

193
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,283
Remember to stick to the plan.

194
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,202
Zeke will be our spear

195
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,996
and Reiner will be our shield.

196
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,040
MARLEY: A MILITARY DICTATORSHIP

197
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,583
AFTER THE GREAT TITAN WAR,
MARLEY WAS REVIVED

198
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,961
AS A FORMIDABLE MILITARY POWER,
UTILIZING 7 OF THE 9 TITANS AS WARRIORS

199
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,980
Damn, that hurts!

200
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,482
Why did a Marleyan like me get shot at?

201
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,943
-What are you doing, Falco?
-You Eldians are supposed to…

202
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,570
-Can't you tell?
-soak up the bullets!

203
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,323
He's in no shape to fight us anymore.

204
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,783
Udo, give me a tourniquet.

205
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,118
-Here.
-Stupid kids.

206
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,828
Screw the enemy.

207
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,790
Is that supposed to be your selling point?

208
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:22,838
You really think obeying the laws of war
will earn you the spot of Armored Titan?

209
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,424
It's not going to help, you know.

210
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:26,926
Like I care?

211
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,845
Weirdo.

212
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,641
He's saying something.

213
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,480
Interpret, Udo.

214
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,232
Say I stopped his bleeding
and that he will be fine--

215
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,359
"Don't touch me."

216
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,486
"I'll be tainted."

217
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,989
"You devil," he says.

218
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,419
Retreat! Hurry up!

219
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,171
Get away from the fort!

220
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,506
Don't get caught in it!

221
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,971
It has begun.

222
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,003
Ahem!

223
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,307
No! Stop!

224
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,650
Truly devils…

225
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:54,573
Our Marleyan ancestors
were eaten, just like that.

226
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,576
By you Eldians.

227
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,827
Fire!

228
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,298
The kinetic bombardment went well,

229
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:16,220
but due to the altitude,
roughly half died on impact.

230
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,974
A lot of the Anti-Titan Artillery
are still operational.

231
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,143
Twenty-eight.

232
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,478
Twenty-nine.

233
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,313
And now I know their locations.

234
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:27,981
But still…

235
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,235
More walls?

236
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,738
I'm sick and tired…

237
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,156
of walls.

238
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,553
-It's the Armored Titan!
-Kill it!

239
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,437
Fire!

240
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,570
Anti-Titan shells that
penetrate even my armor?

241
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,032
What the…

242
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,200
What hit me?

243
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,496
An armored train? There's another?

244
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,893
Shit!

245
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,102
Fire--

246
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,192
Galliard!

247
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,611
You son of a whore!

248
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,019
Nice!

249
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,570
They got it under control?

250
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:43,700
Our defeat brought about this war, Reiner.

251
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,881
Isn't war a terrible thing?

252
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,273
Finally…

253
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,150
With this, the war will be over.

254
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,827
What?

255
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,828
What?

256
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,406
With their fleet destroyed,

257
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:08,577
the Mid-East Allied Forces signed
a peace treaty with Marley.

258
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:13,373
The war spanning four years
ended in a Marleyan victory.

259
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:21,089
But as the world learned that the era
of Titan domination was coming to an end,

260
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:27,179
Marley was pressed to obtain
the Founding Titan as quickly as possible.

261
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,640
Oh, no…

262
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,856
Thanks to the incredible bravery
of the Marley army,

263
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,484
Fort Slava has fallen at last!

264
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,110
-Unbelievable!
-Hooray!

265
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,780
-That's our Marley army for you!
-Hooray!

266
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,115
-Hooray!
-Hooray!

267
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,992
Hooray!

268
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,505
"Titans are not absolute."

269
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,800
Marley was shown this painful reality.

270
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,844
Victory providing a brief joy,

271
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:53,348
the Warriors return
to their hometown of Liberio.

272
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,934
Next episode, "Midnight Train."
