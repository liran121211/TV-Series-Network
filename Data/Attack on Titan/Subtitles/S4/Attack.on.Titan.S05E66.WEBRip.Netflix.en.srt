1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,295
I'm retaking the Founding Titan!

2
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:06,548
Eren!

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,218
What?

4
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:14,597
Was that him?

5
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,100
Is that… Ackermann?

6
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,815
You're kidding…

7
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,483
Can't you see I'm a Titan?

8
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:33,158
These guys are just humans,
yet they are coming to kill me?

9
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,369
These guys…

10
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,873
They are the devils of Paradis!

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,881
Behind us! Retreat!

12
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,883
Shit! I can't shake them!

13
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,593
Damn it!

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,024
Shit! That's here, too?

15
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,527
The Cart Titan!

16
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,653
Pieck!

17
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,156
I guess I made it in time.

18
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:18,161
Like I thought, my machine gun gear
is perfect against their soldiers.

19
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,164
That made getting it worthwhile.

20
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,348
Eren!

21
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,322
That's him all right.

22
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,325
The Beast Titan!

23
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,827
Zeke!

24
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:11,214
I'm going to kill you, Eren Jaeger!

25
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,723
Let no one escape.

26
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,767
Kill them all.

27
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,228
Don't die on me.

28
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,604
Survive!

29
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,335
This is…

30
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:13,938
Is that…

31
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,064
No way.

32
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,774
Mr. Kruger?

33
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,818
No.

34
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,486
Eren Jaeger!

35
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,072
Damn you!

36
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,789
Vice-Captain Braun!

37
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,958
Vice-Captain!

38
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,922
Vice-Captain, I'm sorry!
It's all my fault!

39
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,090
What?

40
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,847
He's alive, but…

41
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,852
He's unconscious,
but his body should heal itself

42
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,687
with the Power of the Titans.

43
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,275
That is, as long as
he has the will to live, but…

44
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,405
I'm sick of this… of myself!

45
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,282
Just kill me!

46
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,875
Vice-Captain, I'll go get help.

47
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,963
There are more than
just enemies out there.

48
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,925
There's me, Gabi, the others…

49
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,094
We're all on your side.

50
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:30,014
Just hang in there, Vice-Captain.

51
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,267
Incoming!

52
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,190
That jerk!

53
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,441
Hey, wait!

54
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,443
I'll slaughter him!

55
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,157
Protect the war chief's rear!

56
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,075
-Right!
-Right!

57
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,161
-Above!
-Bad angle!

58
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,253
Galliard! You're a lifesaver!

59
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,171
-Thanks!
-Pock!

60
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,132
That was close! Thanks!

61
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,508
Be careful!

62
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:09,137
I'm not sure where Ackermann is!
He's hiding somewhere!

63
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,721
Are you serious?

64
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,183
-Porco! The War Hammer Titan!
-Yes.

65
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,109
She has crystallized like Annie.

66
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:26,362
My teeth are useless against that.

67
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,450
But you're completely worn out now.

68
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:36,038
If you had anything left,
you would stab me right through my nape.

69
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,251
You've got no more moves to play.

70
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,130
But I have plenty.

71
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:58,019
Shit! After all that, the bastard
still has more fight in him?

72
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,732
But if we get him, the Founding Titan…

73
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,067
What are you afraid of, Pock?

74
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,277
What?

75
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,988
There's no need for us to rush.

76
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:12,200
We're the ones controlling
the battlefield.

77
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,661
They are being driven into a corner.

78
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:22,668
They came here in ODM gear,
so their weapons and fuel are limited.

79
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:27,548
In other words, they are stranded
in enemy territory without support.

80
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:33,721
The Marley army has surrounded
the zone by now, so there's no escape.

81
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:41,437
For starters, Paradis can't compete
against Marley in a real war anyway.

82
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,273
But if we take out
the Founding Titan right here and now,

83
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,443
they can't do the rumbling!

84
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,071
Their trump card is right in front of us!

85
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:53,699
All the more reason to move cautiously!

86
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:58,746
Right now, just focus on protecting
the war chief from Ackermann.

87
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,707
That's Pieck for you!

88
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,793
Precisely!

89
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:19,559
Eren Jaeger is not my enemy.

90
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,986
Someone else comes first.

91
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,239
Show yourself, Levi.

92
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,491
You're running out of time.

93
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,045
Wow! War Chief Zeke is something else!

94
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,088
Grice?

95
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,091
Commander Magath!

96
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,593
Commander! Back in the venue--

97
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,512
What are you doing?
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

98
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,389
I'm fine!

99
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,641
Then get the hell out of here!

100
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:05,771
Well, Vice-Captain Braun is underground
behind the stage, and he isn't moving!

101
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,731
What?

102
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,026
It's my fault. He was…

103
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,235
shielding me.

104
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,112
Who did it to him?

105
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,822
Eren…

106
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,366
Jaeger.

107
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,795
Hurry and dock!
We need soldiers at Liberio on the double!

108
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,381
The whole zone's taking heavy damage!

109
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,299
What?

110
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:38,054
Hey! Get your ship out of here!
Can't you see the fleet?

111
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,514
Hey!

112
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:44,935
What?

113
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,333
Battleships?

114
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,215
Snap out of it! Get the hell out of here!

115
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,133
But, Commander Magath…

116
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,095
It's the port.
The only one who can do that--

117
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,057
The Colossal Titan!

118
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,602
The Titan they stole from Bertholdt!

119
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,730
Those shits!

120
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:34,485
I guess they didn't barge in here
without a plan after all!

121
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,571
How about this, you damn devils?

122
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,242
If you lose the Founding Titan,
your plans mean jack shit!

123
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:47,832
The other Ackermann? Out of my way!

124
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,839
War Chief! Here comes their attack!

125
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,401
-Zeke!
-Get down, Gabi!

126
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,661
-Zeke?
-Pieck! They are coming!

127
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,436
-What's wrong?
-Hey, Carlo!

128
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,190
Say something, man! Carlo!

129
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,697
You will pay for that!

130
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,408
This is for last time.

131
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,750
Now! Fire!

132
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,421
Pieck!

133
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,425
Guys!

134
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,483
Pieck!

135
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:38,859
NEW ODM GEAR

136
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,902
GEAR USED BY THE PARADIS ISLAND FORCES

137
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,070
WHICH UTILIZES
COMPRESSED GAS AND WIRE HOOKS

138
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,947
FIRED FROM SPECIAL EQUIPMENT TO ALLOW
THEIR SOLDIERS TO NEARLY MIMIC FLIGHT

139
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:38,168
Are these the sort of sights that you saw?

140
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,379
Bertholdt…

141
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,090
No. Please, don't!

142
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,467
Hurry! Finish it off!

143
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,432
Don't shoot! Please, stop!

144
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,070
It missed?

145
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,240
Was it because of the steam or…

146
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,076
Is it my fault I missed?

147
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,081
Pieck!

148
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,708
It's the Cart Titan!

149
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,711
Run away…

150
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,004
Pieck!

151
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,839
Hurry!

152
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,968
Protect Pieck!

153
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,096
Eat shit, you devils!

154
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,307
Braun! Give Grice a hand!

155
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,350
Yes, sir!

156
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,228
Look out! Stay back!

157
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,022
This way! Hurry!

158
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,861
Not only the war chief, but Pieck, too?

159
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,864
Damn it!

160
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,034
Damn you!

161
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,230
So fast!
Ymir's Jaw Titan was nothing like this.

162
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,193
So this is the Jaw Titan's power?

163
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,737
I see.

164
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:33,492
It's awful.
Her body can't heal fast enough.

165
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,328
But she's a Titan, so why?

166
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,163
Unlike the Armored Titan,

167
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,750
the Cart Titan
isn't exactly known for its toughness.

168
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,587
Reiner! Where is he?

169
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,133
You said Eren Jaeger got him
and he's not moving!

170
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,343
Can't he fight? Hey!

171
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,053
I don't know!

172
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:58,183
He's still underground
behind the stage, but I…

173
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,229
I'm thinking
we should leave Reiner out of it!

174
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,732
What are you saying?

175
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,192
What about Udo and Zofia?

176
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,655
What about all the people
Eren Jaeger killed?

177
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,789
Hey, Gabi!

178
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,626
Stay away from the window!
The enemy will see you!

179
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,129
What?

180
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,380
What?

181
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,132
Commander!

182
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:32,760
What?

183
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,146
What?

184
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,404
Commander! I've spotted the guide lights!

185
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,739
Thank goodness.

186
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,658
So far, the operation is going as planned.

187
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,369
We're counting on you, Onyankopon.

188
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,413
Leave it to me, Hanji!

189
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,708
Sneak through the zone, low and slow.

190
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,878
We'll follow the lights
and pick everyone up.

191
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,508
We've only got one shot,
so any stragglers are out of luck.

192
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,385
If we're not shot down first, that is.

193
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,472
Talk about a reckless plan.

194
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,934
Did you get possessed
by Erwin or something?

195
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:26,647
I can only hope.
If it means his strength is with me.

196
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,942
Now that it has come to this,

197
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:35,322
if we can't recover Eren and the others,
there's no future for us.

198
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,369
Jean, it's here.

199
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,204
Yes. Right on time.

200
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,457
You guys think you're escaping on that?

201
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,584
Not happening!

202
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,629
Shoot!

203
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,122
What?

204
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,006
Hey…

205
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,012
You're kidding me!

206
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,142
Stop!

207
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,064
Stop it!

208
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,150
Stop it!

209
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:08,790
Please, stop!

210
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,642
What happened?

211
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,518
The War Hammer Titan was eaten.

212
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,647
And the Jaw Titan is next.

213
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,864
It can't be…

214
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,991
Not Galliard, too.

215
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:52,960
No…

216
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,628
-What?
-No!

217
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:58,382
Reiner!

218
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:02,636
Help us!

219
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:08,892
-Hey!
-Galliard is about to get eaten!

220
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:13,605
Help us!

221
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,191
Reiner!

222
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,444
-Shut up.
-Reiner!

223
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,655
Can you please be quiet?

224
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:28,161
-Reiner!
-Reiner!

225
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:32,916
-Please! Be quiet!
-Reiner!

226
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,254
-Help us!
-Hey! Cut it out, you brats!

227
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,423
-Reiner!
-Hey! Cut it out!

228
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:44,761
-Help us!
-Why won't you guys…

229
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,697
just let me…

230
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,951
die in peace?

231
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,881
Out of strength, the Armored Titan falls.

232
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,301
Furious to have her hometown trampled,

233
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:52,597
Gabi picks up a gun and takes off.

234
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,350
Next episode, "Assassin's Bullet."
