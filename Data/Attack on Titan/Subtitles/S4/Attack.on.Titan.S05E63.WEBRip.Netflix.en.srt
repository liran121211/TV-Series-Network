1
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:03,169
Falco?

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:05,839
Where are you headed this late?

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:10,677
I forgot something at HQ,
so I'm going back to get it.

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,178
See you later!

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,271
Falco, could you do me a favor?

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,648
What's that, Mr. Kruger?

7
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,776
I want to send a letter, but…

8
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,905
if it's sent from the internment zone,
they will check it.

9
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,615
That's right.

10
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:38,663
They might find out I'm not really sick,
so could you send it from outside?

11
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:39,914
Sure thing.

12
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,791
Is it to your family?

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,543
Yes.

14
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:47,255
I want to tell them I'm here
and that I'm doing just fine.

15
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,068
What?

16
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,821
Hey. What's with all the commotion?

17
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,949
The whole Tybur family has come to visit!

18
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,409
Excuse me?

19
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:48,543
It's the Tyburs' personal guard.
They are not part of our military.

20
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,753
Come in.

21
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,465
Sorry to drop in on you.

22
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,844
I'm Willy, the head of the Tybur family.

23
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,222
Commander of the Warrior Unit,
Theo Magath.

24
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:05,059
It's an honor to meet you, Lord Tybur.

25
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,312
Nice to meet you, Commander Magath.

26
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:11,608
Allow me to introduce you to the family.

27
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,486
-Just stop it already!
-Wait!

28
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,488
I don't want to!

29
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,326
Having managed the Warrior Unit
from the outset,

30
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:26,122
are you able to tell which of us
is the War Hammer Titan?

31
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,833
No, I have no clue.

32
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,378
One might wonder if it's even here at all.

33
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,382
You're very astute, just like I've heard.

34
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,010
But it's here.

35
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,764
The War Hammer Titan is among us.

36
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,148
I came here to see the statue of Helos.

37
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:57,111
A century ago,
a mere human slayed the devil of all earth

38
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:01,950
and became the renowned Marleyan hero
who saved the world, Helos.

39
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,410
How marvelous.

40
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,747
So brave and beautiful,
with not a scratch.

41
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,417
Truly, the spirit of Marley.

42
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,503
The spirit, indeed.

43
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,922
For within, it's empty.

44
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,093
You're a tough critic, Commander.

45
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:24,681
I hear you're working
to reinstate Marleyan conscription?

46
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:29,352
War, for Marleyans,
exists solely inside their newspapers.

47
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:33,690
They are content to just read
about our lands expanding.

48
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:40,238
If our tamed devils or conquered armies
are eating the bullets, all the better.

49
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,200
One hopes letting Marleyans hear
the sound of bullets

50
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,994
whizzing by their ears

51
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:50,665
will be enough to stop
our self-destructive march towards war.

52
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,589
If someone controlled Marley
from the shadows, I would tell them,

53
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,591
"It's already too late."

54
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,054
You truly don't hold back, Commander.

55
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,597
What can I say?

56
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:11,102
As you noted,
this nation is controlled by the Tyburs.

57
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:17,608
But this path of warmongering
was one that Marley chose on its own.

58
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:22,864
We gave Marley both freedom
and power in hopes of atonement.

59
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,993
But in the end, Eldia and Marley
were thrown into darkness.

60
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,787
The Tyburs are responsible for that.

61
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,126
I intend to reveal the truth to the world
at the upcoming festival.

62
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:41,716
My coming to see the statue was no lie.
Marley is in need of a hero once more.

63
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,010
Theo Magath.

64
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,388
Will you not join hands with me?

65
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,024
What?

66
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,567
Good morning, Pock!

67
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,821
Pieck! What are you doing?

68
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,741
This way is more natural to me.

69
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,326
Did I scare you?

70
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,080
Can you just walk upright?

71
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,791
Titans come from the south.

72
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:20,380
The wall will be less defended the closer
you get to these mountains up north.

73
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,840
Then we should attack from the north?

74
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,009
That's one option.

75
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:30,723
However, the wharf is the only place
where our large ships can dock.

76
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,725
We could press our advantage.

77
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,602
So the south?

78
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:38,356
But the south
is where our scout ships were lost.

79
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:43,111
It's where they are most focused.
The wharf might even be destroyed.

80
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,947
So what are you trying to say?

81
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,784
I'm merely trying to share
the information I gathered.

82
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,494
All right, enough.

83
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,997
It was dumb to let an Eldian talk.

84
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,547
The Paradis Island planning
is going just swell.

85
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,259
The brass in charge is very intelligent.

86
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,387
I can't wait to hear
what they come up with.

87
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:14,642
Like entrusting the whole thing
to four kids?

88
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,353
What?

89
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,817
He's ahead.

90
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,735
Falco overtook Gabi!

91
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,201
Look at them celebrate one little win.

92
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,329
Jeez. They have got no idea.

93
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,958
No matter how well Falco does
at this point,

94
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,335
he'll never surpass Gabi.

95
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,589
Did you see him take off at the end?

96
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,467
Hey, runts. What's the big deal?

97
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,178
Falco finally beat Gabi!

98
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,180
In grades? Really?

99
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,599
No, just in a race!

100
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,726
This is a historic feat!

101
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,229
Can you cut it out?
You're embarrassing me.

102
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,358
That's pretty awesome!
Maybe you'll be the next Armored Titan!

103
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,861
Oh, god!

104
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:10,031
It's way too late to compete against me!

105
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,326
I made our motherland proud in the war!

106
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,204
I know.

107
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,583
But they still haven't announced
a successor yet.

108
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,337
Until then, I'll do everything I can.

109
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,218
Man, talk about showing off.

110
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,429
Your brother is already
inheriting the Beast Titan!

111
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,473
You'll be an Honorary Marleyan!

112
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,100
What's the point of trying so hard?

113
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,274
I'm doing it for you!

114
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,901
Oh, my…

115
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,778
He totally said it!

116
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,783
What?

117
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,537
You're getting in my way,
but you're doing it for me?

118
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,539
That doesn't make any damn sense!

119
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,167
I guess it didn't get through.

120
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,126
What?

121
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,587
What is his problem? What gives?

122
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,551
Oh, welcome back, our little Warriors!

123
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,469
Gabi!

124
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:19,559
I heard what you did, Gabi!
You're our savior, Gabi!

125
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,270
Well, I'm Zofia, so…

126
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,187
What?

127
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,814
What's wrong with you?

128
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,943
Quit day drinking and grabbing girls,
you geezer!

129
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:33,573
Shut up, you nincompoop!
What's wrong with praising a hero?

130
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,993
If anything,
being praised by you is bad luck!

131
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,870
Go on! Stumble back home to your mom!

132
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,750
Now then, I've got a treat for you kids!

133
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,963
Eat up and grow big
like Vice-Captain Braun!

134
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,215
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

135
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,511
Oh, my!

136
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,141
Will they really declare war
right here in the zone?

137
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,393
Reminds me of a theater.

138
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,314
I heard they're inviting VIPs here

139
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:10,651
and after putting on this festival,
the world will be on our side.

140
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,321
Fantastic!

141
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,617
All of Marley's problems
will magically go away!

142
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,785
You think it won't work?

143
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,662
You actually think it will?

144
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:26,167
The Mid-East Allied Forces
we were just slaughtering will be there.

145
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,837
My family came
from an internment zone abroad,

146
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,923
so I know how awful it is.

147
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:37,803
The hate for Eldians abroad
makes the hate here seem trivial.

148
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,807
Well, all the more reason
we've got to try something.

149
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:46,604
They might have chosen to hold it here
so people understand us!

150
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,440
We can show them we're not devils!

151
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:50,941
But how?

152
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,193
Smile!

153
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,197
I know you can't wait
to show the world they are wrong,

154
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,199
but stop looking so smug.

155
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,786
And, Zofia,
cut it out with your weird act.

156
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,205
Well, this is who I am.

157
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,583
Fine! So what are you going to fix?

158
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,876
What?

159
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,754
There's no need because I'm perfect as is!

160
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,131
I'm smart and cute as a button!

161
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:19,679
And when I captivate all the VIPs,
it will secure my spot even more!

162
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,389
I think I spot a devil.

163
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:26,769
If you guys cheer for Falco again,
I'll make you cry!

164
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,479
You really are a devil!

165
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,565
It's Commander Magath.

166
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,734
Here.

167
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:42,493
Oh, a large-scale demolition is required?

168
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,496
It has decayed beyond repair.

169
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:53,254
Congratulations, General.
The military is yours.

170
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,463
No.

171
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,632
The military serves the nation,

172
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,636
and this nation's
supreme commander is you.

173
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:07,143
That's not quite true.
I'm simply the one who holds the wheel.

174
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,647
Now I know why my predecessors
never tried to grab it.

175
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,150
It's so heavy.

176
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:21,157
I wish I could let go this very moment,
but a time has come where I must not.

177
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,493
It just happened to be me.

178
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,789
I'm simply the man
this responsibility fell upon.

179
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:34,378
The house was in danger of collapsing,
but some pillars remained usable.

180
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:40,926
According to them,
the house is already infested with rats.

181
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,054
Nice work, Falco.

182
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,932
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Kruger!

183
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:51,270
But at this point,
I honestly doubt I can outperform Gabi.

184
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,940
Even so, I'm going to keep moving forward.

185
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,776
I see.

186
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,862
I'm the one who should be
thanking you, though.

187
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,616
I'm grateful
you've been sending all of my letters.

188
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,826
You've been a big help.

189
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:07,953
That's nothing.

190
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,625
Did your family send you that?

191
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,378
They thought it would make
hospital life less boring.

192
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,465
It's hard to do much
in this shape, though.

193
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,218
I need to move forward, too.

194
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,597
When the festival is over,
I'm going back to my hometown.

195
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,767
I see.

196
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,853
A doctor's coming.

197
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,897
I'll get going!

198
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,065
Yes.

199
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,444
May I sit next to you?

200
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,238
Yes, sure.

201
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,574
I appreciate it.

202
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,455
I'm Jaeger, a physician for the zone.

203
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,500
I come here to drink tea sometimes.

204
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,878
Nice to meet you. I'm Kruger.

205
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,881
Nice to meet you, Kruger.

206
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,468
You seem to get along with that boy.

207
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,511
Yes.

208
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,637
I see.

209
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,723
I think I could get along with him, too.

210
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:14,395
I sit here on this bench looking
for people to talk to.

211
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:19,900
His uncle was a leader
of the Eldian Restorationists.

212
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:25,906
Restorationists are sent to paradise
and not even their family is spared.

213
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,911
To protect their family,
he and his brother trained to be Warriors,

214
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:35,916
and when his brother was chosen
to inherit the Beast Titan,

215
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,086
the Grice family knew
they were finally safe.

216
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,507
Why are you telling me this?

217
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,761
Stop asking the boy to do favors for you.

218
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,639
If he comes under suspicion,

219
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,559
all their effort
will have been for nothing.

220
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:59,273
And if you're truly healthy,
you should go back to your family.

221
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,443
Someday, you won't see them anymore.

222
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,696
Don't wait and live with regret.

223
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,700
Regret, huh?

224
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,332
Do you have regrets about your own family?

225
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,587
There's not a day that I don't.

226
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:26,592
That day,
my son took my daughter outside the walls.

227
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:31,597
It's because I was too strict
about him becoming a doctor!

228
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,726
It's my fault!

229
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,187
Everything was my fault!

230
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,234
Mr. Jaeger!

231
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,904
Please don't go around on your own!

232
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,074
I'm so sorry. I looked away for a second.

233
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,868
This way, Mr. Jaeger.

234
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,329
Everything will be okay.

235
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:03,796
TYBUR FAMILY

236
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,339
A FAMILY OF NOBLES THAT REVOLTED
AGAINST ELDIA IN THE GREAT TITAN WAR

237
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,715
THEY HOLD SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE
BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND ABROAD

238
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,883
CURRENTLY, WILLY TYBUR
IS THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY

239
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,641
Amazing!

240
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,393
I've seen them in the paper!

241
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,395
Cut the chitchat.

242
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,523
We've got to be waiters like we trained.

243
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,526
Look, there are empty glasses! Get them!

244
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,578
-Falco, drink!
-Here!

245
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,416
What?

246
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,002
Oh, there's filthy blood
touching the plates.

247
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,046
That explains why the food stinks!

248
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,512
I'm terribly sorry!

249
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,597
Shush! Don't make a fuss.

250
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,392
But your fancy clothes--

251
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,894
Is everything all right, madam?

252
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,564
How embarrassing!

253
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:08,027
I spilled wine on my kimono
and was asking for help!

254
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,403
Thank you.

255
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,656
I'm sorry to hear that.
Please, come this way.

256
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,700
Why?

257
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,911
Who knows what would have happened to you?

258
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,165
Are you okay?

259
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,542
Yes. She saved me.

260
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,962
She knew I was an Eldian.

261
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,089
That woman…

262
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,634
I think she's an Easterner from Hizuru.

263
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,390
It's Willy!

264
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,600
Oh, my…

265
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,185
Willy!

266
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,021
Savior's Descendent!

267
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,399
Ambassador Ogweno! Long time no see!

268
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,317
Nambia!

269
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,402
We were kids the last time I saw you!

270
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,739
I used to make you cry all the time!

271
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,741
Remember this, Willy?

272
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,952
Oh, from the time
you fell out of the tree!

273
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:09,963
Ladies and gentlemen,
we thank you all for coming tonight!

274
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:16,970
Until recently, we were squabbling
over resources in an unsightly war.

275
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,599
However,
yesterday's enemy is today's enemy!

276
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,851
Pardon me.

277
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,354
Yesterday's enemy is today's friend!

278
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,358
Let's wash the past
down the toilet with our drinks!

279
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,237
Please raise your glasses
and join me for a toast!

280
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,615
To everlasting peace!

281
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,786
Thank you very much!

282
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,706
-Such an elegant joke to amuse our guests!
-What?

283
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,375
But I'm afraid our guests

284
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:50,754
didn't quite understand,
so allow me to take over.

285
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,381
Yes, Willy!

286
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,424
Savior's Descendent!

287
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:03,016
Tomorrow, I invite all of you
to the Liberio Internment Zone.

288
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:07,396
It is the home of people
whose blood runs through me.

289
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:14,236
The ones called devils for slaughtering
a great number of people, the Eldians.

290
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:18,198
Though once repressed
more greatly than any,

291
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:23,287
Marley has used the devils to oppress
other nations and repeat the tragedy.

292
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,041
I understand the desire
to exterminate the Eldians.

293
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:34,381
But I have arrived at a single solution
that will answer this endless problem.

294
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:41,555
Tomorrow, I will reveal that solution
in my first-ever theater production.

295
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:46,059
To the great playwrights
and witnesses of history!

296
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,062
To the playwrights
and witnesses of history!

297
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,828
What the…

298
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,051
What in the world?

299
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,303
Gabi! You're finally up!

300
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,055
What's happening?

301
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,306
The festival!

302
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:29,603
People from outside came pouring in
and opened all these stalls!

303
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,812
Try this!

304
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,732
This is a festival?

305
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,858
Let's go!

306
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,222
It hurts!

307
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,307
It's because you stuffed your face.

308
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,395
I wish we had festivals every day!

309
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,063
Blech!

310
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,147
Yes.

311
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:19,152
Lately, it seems like lots
of new things have been happening.

312
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,570
It does.

313
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:25,409
It kind of feels like something
is about to change!

314
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:27,786
Yes.

315
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,830
It does.

316
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,356
Oh, did you guys have fun?

317
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,483
What? Where's Falco?

318
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:43,445
He said he saw someone
he knew and ran off.

319
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,281
Really? What's the matter with him?

320
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,451
Can't you just loosen up for a day?

321
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,453
So many people…

322
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,705
What? Looks like he's back.

323
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,457
Mr. Braun!

324
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,001
Where the hell did you go?

325
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,212
Can you come with me?

326
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,588
Right now?

327
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,592
You'll be fine.
It shouldn't start for a bit.

328
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,636
This way!

329
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,596
What's this all about?

330
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,099
You'll see soon enough!

331
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,604
In here!

332
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:19,815
Okay.

333
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,112
I brought him!

334
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,739
Hey.

335
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,367
It's been four years, Reiner.

336
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,916
Eren!

337
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,923
In a dusky cellar, Reiner confronts Eren.

338
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:49,970
As the crowd is absorbed
by Willy's speech, Eren admits…

339
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,931
"I'm the same as you."

340
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,934
Next episode, "Declaration of War."
