A stroke of wind blew his hat from his head, which prompt him to remember a promise he made with a pirate he knew long ago. That man was Captain Shanks, who was a hero to Luffy, and gave Luffy his hat to take care of until they meet again. As a kid, he always wanted to join Shank's crew, but he tells him that a pirate's life is not for a kid like Luffy. This was also Luffy's encounter with the Devil's Fruit which made him obtain his ability to be made entirely of rubber. And the real reason on why his main goal in life is to become the Pirate King.\u2014J LeGault"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0947174", "rating": 8.3, "votes": 5642, "number_of_episodes": 1147}
