He continuously beat Sanji up with his karate moves. And didn't gave him a chance to resurface for air. Kurobi goes on how inferior Humans are when it comes to needing air to survive. As Sanji is running out of breathe, he discovers that Kurobi has gills like a fish. Which means that Kurobi will be useless if his own gills were damaged. So he bit Kurobi's gills and resurfaced to breathe again. Kurobi also resurfaced and told Sanji that it's doesn't matter if the battle in underwater or on land. It's all the same to a merman. But Sanji proved Kurobi to be wrong as he gave him a series of body kicks which sent him through the park wall and left unconscious. After watching both of his henchmen loosing, Arlong decides to show Zoro and Sanji not to mess with his species. Meanwhile Chu thinks his finally killed Usopp with his water cannon, as he's laying in a pool of blood. He leaves, but doesn't know that Usopp is faking it, as the pool of blood is actually ketchup. When Usopp got up and tried to think up an excuse for all this. But couldn't up but thinking that he's the only coward of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew. As everyone has the courage to fight, while he makes up lies on why he didn't fight in the battle. Not when he promised his friends back home, that he'll overcome many dangers as a pirate. And for that he drew Chu's attention to prove he can fight his own battle. He used his slingshot abilities and eventually threw a liquor bottle at Chu. And set him on fire with his flaming slingshot attack. Then he made sure that Chu is down for good, so he continued to he him with his hammer. Until he won, for the first time he's actually defeated an enemy all by himself. That made him feel like the great pirate he claims to be. Sanji and Zoro find Arlong to be a difficult opponent. As his throwing water move is like attacked by a shark. And Luffy is still unconscious. Nami appears and shows her true colors and this time she's not Arlong's little navigator.\u2014J LeGault"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0967038", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 2169, "number_of_episodes": 1147}
