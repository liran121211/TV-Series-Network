Igaram insisted that Zoro should protect the princess. Zoro didn't think so, not when they were trying to kill them off earlier. There is in fact a reward involved for the ones who bring back the princess safe to Arabasta. Nami was interested in the reward, and told Zoro to look after the princess. Zoro wanted to know why he'd take orders from her. Nami noted that he owes her 200,000 Belli from their last trip to Loguetown. Do his part, and they'll be even.

For hurting all those people who gave them the hospitality. Zoro tried to explained to him on what really happened. But Luffy was too pigheaded to understand what really is going on.
