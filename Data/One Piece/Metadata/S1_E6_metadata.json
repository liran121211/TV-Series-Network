After pulling off a good fight with Buggy, they learn that Buggy also ate one of the legendary Devil's Fruit. His special ability is \"Splitting Body\". Which makes it impossible for Zoro to cut him up. He got injured and had to make a retreat by caring Luffy's cage with Naomi following behind. After a blast from the \"Buggy Bomb\", Luffy & Zoro find themselves in front of a pet shop guarded by a dog. Luffy(who's still locked in the cage) couldn't figure out what the dog's problem is. The dog ate the key to the cage which made Luffy mad and violent. Right until the Mayor came by to tell them not to bother ShuShu(the dog's name) as his previous owner has given him the duty to watch over the shop. ShuShu has been through a lot of heart warming moments with his owner in the past. While Zoro went to get healed, Luffy soon became friends with ShuShu. Then out of nowhere Mohji the Beast Tammer and his pet Lion: Ritchie were hired by Buggy to eliminate them. They start by beating up ShuShu and sabotaging the pet shop. This made Luffy angry, and won't let them get away with it without a fight.\u2014J LeGault"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0949128", "rating": 7.6, "votes": 3706, "number_of_episodes": 1147}
