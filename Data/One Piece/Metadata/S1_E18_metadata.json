Luffy designs the crew's own pirate flag, since they now own a pirate ship. His design was rather sloppy, so Usopp(who happens to be good at painting) re-did it into a more professional look. They now have their own pirate flag logo: A Skull with a straw hat. Since they're the \"Straw Hat Pirates\". Nami sees an island up ahead, which is called \"Legendary Treasure Island\". Many pirates visited the island, but never found the treasure. They say that a Guardian God protects the island from those who try to steal it. When they went ashore on the island, it all seemed quiet right until they're surrounded by mixed up animals. More weirded out than before, the voice of the so called Guardian God was heard. Only when Luffy discovered that it's actually a bush-haired boxed man who's been marooned on the island for 20 years. His name is Gaiman, and he was once a regular crew member of a pirate crew who came to this island, 20 years ago. Only to find a empty box. Gaiman noticed a mountain that wasn't checked by the crew, so he climbed up to the top to find a stash of treasure chests. But then he slipped and got stuck in the box he's in today. His crew left without him leaving Gaiman miserable. To this day he's been protecting the treasure from other pirates with the help of his animal friends. After hearing this sad story, Luffy and the others decided to help Gaiman out.\u2014J LeGault"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0960523", "rating": 6.8, "votes": 2382, "number_of_episodes": 1147}
