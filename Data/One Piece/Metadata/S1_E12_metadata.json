In order to protect the village from mayhem, the south coast slope will need to be blocked off. So according to Usopp, the south slope is the only way to the village. His plan is to cover it with oil and attack the pirate with surprise. But by the time it was morning, Nami heard voices coming from the other side of the island. She was curious if this was the only entrance to the village. Then Usopp realized that there's another slope like this one at the north coast. Usopp dashed to the north coast while Luffy is completely lost, as he doesn't know which way is north. While Nami remembered that their boats were also at the north coastline, and has to get there before Buggy's Treasure is stolen again. When Usopp finally made it to the north slope, he's prepared to defend the village with all his might. But will Luffy(who's lost) and Zoro(who got stuck in the oil slick thanks to Nami pushing him by accident) get there in time to help Usopp?\u2014J LeGault"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0957053", "rating": 7.5, "votes": 2537, "number_of_episodes": 1147}
