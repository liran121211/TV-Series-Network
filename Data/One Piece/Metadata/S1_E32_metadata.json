Arlong keeps asking him on what is his true plan. And Zoro kept telling him he's looking for a woman and called him half fish. Arlong let the insult went by and told Zoro that he hates man kind so much. He believes that mermen should be the superior species on the planet. As mermen are stronger and have the ability to live underwater as well as land. He's taken over the entire island he owns, and is powerful with the money he's inherited from the marines and villagers. Then a woman came out and criticize Arlong's monologuing on his theory about Mermen being dominate species. Zoro recognized the girl as Nami. And she's wearing a tank top instead of her usual shirt. Nami shows off a tattoo that symbolizes Arlong's flag. She reveals to him that she's been part of the merman crew from the very beginning. As she's the only human officer of the Merman crew. While enjoying their meal, a sea monster cow comes charging to Luffy, Yosuka, and Sanji's boat. Luffy punches it to protect the food from being eaten. Sanji told him not to beat up hungry animals. He offers the monstrous sea cow a piece of meat, but it was an act and gave the huge cow monster a big kick. They used the sea monster to toll their way towards Arlong Park. Meanwhile Usopp wakes up and finds himself inside a house. The woman who he saw earlier saved him from the merman. Her name is Nojiko and she has her own orange orchard. The boy who attempted to go up against the mermen is still disappointed that he didn't get to kill one. His father was killed by Arlong and since then the boy wants to get rid of them.
