And they set sail with both Luffy's boat and a boat with Buggy's stolen sail. Their next destination is to find themselves a larger boat with supplies. And Luffy has a hunch they'll find one on an island with a small village and beach. When they landed on shore they find themselves ambushed by Usopp, who claims to be captain of his own crew. But Naomi sees through the act that Ussop is only accompanied by 3 kids who admire his ambition in being a pirate. Usopp admits that he's just a \"wannabee\" pirate who does nothing but run and shout out lies throughout the village for fun. Usopp took them to the village dine for a bite to eat. And Luffy, Zoro, and Naomi soon found out that Usopp is the son of Yasopp the crew member of Captain Shank's crew. Luffy met Yasopp before and recognized the family resemblance between Usopp and his dad. Usopp hopes to become an actual pirate one day like his own father. Now our friends will need to see about finding a ship and supplies. And Usopp's depressed and wealthy friend Kaya may help them out.\u2014J LeGault"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0952146", "rating": 7.1, "votes": 2871, "number_of_episodes": 1147}
