Kuro arrives and it disappointed that his crew hasn't done a thing according to plan. And figured they wouldn't of had a problem dealing with a bunch of pests. Sham and Buchi didn't take any of Kuro's abuse as they believe he's been out of practice ever since he became a caretaker. So they figure they wouldn't have a problem beating him. But Kuro then disappeared with the use of fancy foot steps and reappears behind Sham and Buchie with his \"Cat Claw\" finger tip swords. He gets rid of the Nyaban Brothers instantly. And for that Kuro decides to give the pirate crew 5 minutes to kill Luffy, Nami, Zoro, and Usopp. Otherwise they will all die by the slash of his Cat Claws. Then Kaya appears and knows the truth, but can't believe that her favorite caretaker is a murderous pirate. Not after all the years they been through. Will Kuro kill Kaya? Will Usopp be able to protect the girl who likes? And will Luffy revive himself from the hypnosis?\u2014J LeGault"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0957056", "rating": 7.6, "votes": 2427, "number_of_episodes": 1147}
