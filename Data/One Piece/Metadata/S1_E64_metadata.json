First it was snowing, which Luffy and Usopp found an activity to do including snow ball fights and snowman building. Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday were complaining that there's no heater. Nami told them to shut up as she couldn't help but how strange that it became cold from warm in minutes. But then she found out that they're off course according to the log pose, and need to turn 180 degrees. As everyone got busy in getting the ship back on course, they face a series of changing weather, including storms, lightning, fog, and ice bergs. When it all got calm, Zoro woke up from his nap and found them all exhausted on deck. Sanji, Usopp and Nami were angry that Zoro didn't do a thing during his nap. Zoro noticed Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday, and didn't know they were helping out 2 individuals while he was sleeping. Nami explained to him that their taking them home to Whiskey Peak. Zoro couldn't help but think that he might of met the strange duo once. But doesn't recall. Nami beat up Zoro for sleeping on the job, and announced to everyone that after the recent experience, she'll need to put her navigation skills at work in order to master the unexpected weather. Then an island was spotted where Whiskey Peak is. On Cactus Island, a cacti shape island. Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday thanked them for helping them get back to their island. They jumped off the ship and swam their way towards it. Without any questions, the Straw Hat Pirates went to see what Cactus Island is like. Usopp is worried that there might be monsters to face, since they're in Grand Line. And suggests that they leave as soon as possible. Nami reminded them that they need to wait for a period of time till the log pose adapts to the magnetic field their in. Which may take a matter of days or weeks till their able to know what their next destination is. Usopp got a disturb idea about spending a week on a monster filled island. But whatsoever on the island, they'll face it either way. As the Going Merry travels through the misty river, entrance to Whiskey Peak, they discovered a crowd of people on both sides of the land. They prepared themselves for battle, only to find themselves being cheered by the citizens of Whiskey Peak. And pirates are honored as welcomed heroes to their town. This was surprising but rather enjoyable to be welcomed than to be hated. As our heroes landed at the pier, they were welcomed by the mayor of Whiskey Peak: Igarappoi(a tall, curly haired man with an irritated throat). He introduces them to the island's hospitality and celebration to having pirates visit their town. Luffy, Usopp and Sanji went ahead to enjoy themselves. While Zoro and Nami find all this a little suspicious. That night, the Straw Hat Pirates had a banquet with the town folks. Drinks and food were served. Whiskey Peak, according to Igarappoi their town is famous for the quality in fine wine from the best grapes you'll ever taste. Nami entered the traditional Kanpai Contest(because the prize is 100,000 Belli) with Zoro for an extra chance to win the money. Luffy ate non stop, Sanji flirted with 20 women at once, and Usopp goes on about his experience with the Calm Blet(which the locals believe is all true, but it ain't). Meanwhile Miss Wednesday and Mr. 9 wrote out a report, that they failed to kill Laboon, but have successfully lured a group of pirates for bounty. Miss Wednesday took the report and put it in an Unluckies Box(special mailbox) so that way it'll go directly to their boss. Zoro was already past out, so Nami and a nun were the last 2 remaining at the drinking contest. Nami won, but past out, as well as Luffy, Usopp and Sanji. and the party was already over after they're all tired out. Igarappoi went outside to be meted by Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday. It's revealed that Igarappoi works for them as Mr. 8, who plans to get the 30,000,000 Belli bounty on Luffy and the others. The nun from the drinking contest came out and revealed to herself as Miss Monday(a black bodybuilding woman). They all plan to take the Straw Hat Pirates alive for the bounty award money. Zoro overheard all of this, and gave their attention. They saw him sitting on the roof and presumed that he was worn out like the others. But a great swordsman like Zoro, doesn't let alcohol get to him. He knows that Mr. 8, and the others work for Baroque Works. Zoro knows about this organization, because he was offered a job in it a while back. But refused because of the sue of code names and the boss's identity being a secret to all the members who serve in it. And Zoro knows that all the citizens of Whiskey Peak are bounty hunters who welcome the pirates who come here, and kill them while they're drunk and worn out. All those dead pirates are buried on the Cactus Rocks. Igarappoi sends everyone to get Zoro, only to find him gone without a trace.
