Zoro takes his usual map. And starts to remember a promise he made when he was still learning to become a swordsman. He was so desperate in becoming the best, but he couldn't defeat the strongest student of the fencing team, Kuina. She's the only girl of the fencing team and the Sensai's daughter. She's so good, no one else could over come her ability of the sword. Zoro spent his time in training and improving his stamina so he can beat Kuina fare and square. But after 2001 losses, he finds it impossible to defeat someone like Kuina. So to make it up for him, Kuina told him that the next time they meet she'll become the greatest swords-person in the world. Zoro also notes that he'll become the greatest too. And because of that they made a promise in following their own paths to mastering the ways of the sword. And since then Zoro has never forgotten about how he became who he is today.\u2014J LeGault"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0961581", "rating": 8.9, "votes": 4605, "number_of_episodes": 1147}
