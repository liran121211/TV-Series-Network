<i>(Dream save us us) us, all of us</i>

3
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,235
<i>The end of a dream, the end of the sea</i>

4
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,946
<i>We all have different places we want to go</i>

5
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,449
<i>But first, we need</i>

6
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:36,911
<i>To make a shining legend out of ourselves</i>

7
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,665
{\an8}<i>Sparks fly, no limit
This is where it starts</i>

8
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,292

00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,919
<i>All of us, I ask you travelers</i>

10
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,298
<i>Are your dreams still pure?</i>

11
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:56,681
<i>Sleepless cells are shaken and burst</i>

12
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:03,438
<i>Still, all of us
In the middle of an adventure</i>

13
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,940
{\an8}<i>All of us, I tell you travelers</i>

14
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,819
{\an8}<i>No such thing as a pointless fight</i>

15
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,032
<i>When random contexts</i>

16
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:17,827
<i>Start to make sense on their own</i>

17
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:24,542
<i>The threads of time are spun back together</i>

18
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:29,798
{\an8}<i>The world keeps changing along with us</i>

19
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,342
<i>(All of us) us, us</i>

20
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:37,806
<i>(Dream save us us) us, all of us</i>

21
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:45,814
Now, explain to us!

22
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,273
KING COBRA ASSASSINATED

23
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,902
The truth... behind this shocking news!

24
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,321
<i>After returning to Kamabakka Queendom,</i>

25
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,990
<i>Sabo started recounting about the incident</i>

26
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,409
<i>that took place
in the Holy Land Mary Geoise.</i>

27
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:02,831
<i>It's an emergency! Someone trespassed
into the Land of the Gods!</i>

28
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,291
I saw Saint Rosward and his son Charlos...

29
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,964
I will save... Kuma-san at any cost!

30
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,883
{\an8}Stop!

31
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,679
{\an8}Only King Cobra is permitted
an audience with the Five Elders.

32
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:18,805
But...

33
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,933
Cobra-sama is not in good health.

34
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,643
Stand back.

35
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,729
Cobra-sama...

36
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,484
This won't take long,

37
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,320
but I think it'll be boring to
just wait outside.

38
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,614
I need you to guard Vivi.

39
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,409
She's still so mischievous,

40
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,870
and I can't stop worrying about her.

41
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:49,627
<i>"The Holy Land in Tumult!
Sai and Leo's Full-Power Blow!"</i>

42
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,632
HOLY LAND MARY GEOISE

43
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,439
You bastard!

44
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,316
Give me back the keys!

45
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,816
You're Sabo, right?!

46
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,319
What? You're...

47
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,488
Jewelry Bonney?!

48
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,324
If you know me, that'll save us time.

49
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,910
We might have the same goal.

50
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,580
There are intruders in the guardroom!

51
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,876
{\an8}They stole the keys
to the slaves' collars! Catch them!

52
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,339
I heard that Kuma-san had a daughter.

53
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,093
I've always been keeping tabs on
the Revolutionary Army's news.

54
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,263
So I trust you guys!

55
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,098
Please save my father!

56
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,475
Yeah, that's what we're here for.

57
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,939
-What?!
-Karasu!

58
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:33,982
Yeah.

59
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:38,194
Take these keys! And tell this
to Morley and the others, too.

60
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,989
Once you unlock Kuma-san
and the slaves' collars,

61
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,907
go straight back to the headquarters.

62
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,409
Your mission is complete!

63
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,790
What about you, Sabo?

64
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,709
I'll follow you once I finish my business!

65
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,961
Okay. But be careful!

66
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,136
What are you gonna do next, Bonney?

67
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,138
I'm gonna go to Egghead.

68
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,389
All by yourself?

69
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,473
Yeah.

70
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,394
Are you gonna be okay?
That's the World Government's territory.

71
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,440
I've got to ask Vegapunk how to restore
my father's sense of self!

72
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,900
That's what I set out to sea for!

73
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,654
Is there a way to restore
his sense of self?

74
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:26,951
Even if there isn't, I'll make him do it!
If he can't...

75
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,912
There they are!

76
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,206
This way! Hurry up!

77
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,250
What?

78
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,925
Where are they?!

79
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,135
No one's here!

80
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,726
That's strange. I saw someone here...

81
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,105
Th-Thanks.

82
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:05,615
Hey, they reduced the number of guards
in this tower again.

83
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,452
Even though
there's so much space to cover.

84
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,497
Don't you know?

85
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,582
It's mostly because of that.

86
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:15,500
What?

87
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,503
They saw it.

88
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,004
Saw what?

89
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,380
The Lost Chamber.

90
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,008
You idiot! Don't even joke about it!

91
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,140
I think we're safe now.

92
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,141
Thanks.

93
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,268
Egghead is in the New World.

94
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,854
We're heading in the opposite direction.

95
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,565
Then I guess this is where we say goodbye.

96
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,608
Be careful.

97
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,526
Yeah.

98
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,402
I wish you luck.

99
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,490
This feels weird.

100
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,576
It wouldn't be so strange
if you were a pirate,

101
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,579
but a Revolutionary being so kind to me...

102
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,708
We both want to save the same person.

103
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,214
Yeah. Take care of my father!

104
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,811
<i>Don't you know?</i>

105
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,230
<i>It's mostly because of that.</i>

106
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,607
<i>The Lost Chamber...</i>

107
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,820
What would you like to ask us?

108
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,408
King Cobra of the Kingdom of Alabasta.

109
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,120
Well...

110
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,082
Where should I begin?

111
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:11,509
The World Government was founded
by 20 monarchs...

112
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,845
800 years ago.

113
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,683
As the creators of the world,

114
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,602
they relocated their families
to Mary Geoise.

115
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,355
They eventually became known
as the Celestial Dragons,

116
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:28,192
and have been reigning over the world
for 800 years.

117
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:33,614
Inside, the 20 monarchs
treated each other equally,

118
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,118
and to avoid any of them
rising to become a dictator,

119
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,329
they intentionally installed
an empty throne,

120
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,207
and placed their weapons around it

121
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:47,128
as a symbol of the oath
that no one would sit there.

122
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,090
Meanwhile, in the 20 countries
that lost their royal families,

123
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:55,386
new monarchs were selected
and have been in place ever since.

124
00:09:55,469 --> 00:10:00,266
Therefore, the names of the royal families
of the First Twenty...

125
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,643
have been removed
from their home countries.

126
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,605
But Alabasta was different.

127
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:11,611
Queen Lily of the Nefeltari Family
had her name remain in the First Twenty,

128
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:15,406
but she didn't become a Celestial Dragon
and went back to Alabasta,

129
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,910
so the Nefeltari Family still exists
in her country.

130
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:26,208
For that reason, to be exact, there are
only 19 weapons surrounding the throne.

131
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,046
That's true. But so what?

132
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,550
I've been reading all the old books
that remain in my country.

133
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,095
All we can know...

134
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:43,059
is the history written in the literature
after the Void Century.

135
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,480
But it wasn't there. Queen Lily's name!

136
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,987
She never made it back
to the Kingdom of Alabasta.

137
00:10:55,613 --> 00:11:00,284
Her younger brother
ruled the country thereafter.

138
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,830
Could you tell me what you know?

139
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,500
Is that what you want to ask us?

140
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,753
<i>About 800 years ago?</i>

141
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,215
<i>It's true that the monarch
of the Nefeltari Family alone</i>

142
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,759
<i>didn't live here,</i>

143
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,846
<i>But we thought she went back
to her country, too.</i>

144
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,808
<i>Why she did it and where she went...</i>

145
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:27,812
<i>Since that was a long time ago,
there is no way for us to know.</i>

146
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,774
I'm sorry. We have no idea.

147
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,784
{\an8}Then what is the D?

148
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,288
Why are you asking that?

149
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:51,043
Well, actually, a short letter
she left 800 years ago...

150
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,548
has been passed down
through our royal family for generations...

151
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,080
PANGAEA CASTLE

152
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,332
Please stop!

153
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,084
Please!

154
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,836
Please!

155
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,172
You're hurting me!

156
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,425
Somebody, please help!

157
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,014
I did-<i>eh</i>! Father-sama!

158
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,266
I didn't give up!

159
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:50,269
I caught a giant mermaid-<i>eh</i>!

160
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,272
Mm-hm, well done! Charlos!

161
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,983
Somebody, please help!

162
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,653
Oh no... My dear Princess Shirahoshi...

163
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,032
What should I feed you-<i>eh</i>?

164
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:08,412
I'll climb on you and go around the town
every day-<i>eh</i>!

165
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,832
Shirahoshi is mine-<i>eh</i>!

166
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,418
Get out of my way-<i>eh</i>!

167
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,672
This feels great-<i>eh</i>!

168
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,427
If you don't obey me,
I'll give you hell-<i>eh</i>!

169
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,929
I refuse!

170
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,016
Somebody, please!

171
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,894
Help me!

172
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:36,315
Oh no! My daddy and all our guards
are in the Council Tower...

173
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,318
Please! Somebody!

174
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,322
When it comes to this...

175
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,824
Please...

176
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,828
Run!

177
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,038
No!

178
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,414
Hey, you mermaid.

179
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:56,585
You just said "I refuse"!
You're rebellious-<i>eh</i>!

180
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,922
Asking for help is the height of rudeness!

181
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,425
We were turned down by her anyway!

182
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,470
Yeah! Who cares if she lives or dies!

183
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,680
Out of my way!

184
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,975
You guys are just like wakame seaweed,
easily swayed by others!

185
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,477
The Kingdom of Ryugu!

186
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,482
You better not rebel against them!
Your country will be destroyed!

187
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,237
Sorry! We dropped our guard, Shirahoshi!

188
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,989
Brothers!

189
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,740
Sorry to keep you waiting!

190
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:30,119
Now that we're here, you're safe!

191
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,875
Let's go home!
We'll never come back to this place again!

192
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,626
Brother Fukaboshi...

193
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,880
You guys should go home now-<i>eh</i>.

194
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:46,135
I'll keep this mermaid as my pet-<i>eh</i>.

195
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,388
Damn you Celestial Dragon!

196
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,515
How dare you do that to our sister!

197
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,643
We'll make you pay!

198
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,981
Do it-<i>eh</i>!

199
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,026
Invincible Slave, Kuma!

200
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,950
Big Brother!

201
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,411
Shirahoshi!

202
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,704
Rebecca-sama!

203
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,414
I'll help you now!

204
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,125
Rebecca! It's that man again!

205
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,045
It's so aggravating! I won't forgive them!

206
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,508
Hey, Myosgard!
I can beat him up this time, right?!

207
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,553
Yeah!
I'll take full responsibility for it!

208
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,184
A former Warlord of the Sea,
Bartholomew Kuma!

209
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,310
Poor guy!

210
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,270
But it doesn't matter! Let's go!

211
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,147
Ryuboshi! Mamboshi!

212
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,065
Yeah!

213
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,567
You can kill them-<i>eh</i>, Kuma!

214
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,571
Even if they're a royal family,
we can buy our way out-<i>eh</i>!

215
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,323
Especially because they're Fish-Men!

216
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,033
Damn you!

217
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,204
Fukaboshi-dono!
Royal families must restrain themselves!

218
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,457
-Get out of my way!
-Leave it to them!

219
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,128
What's the difference
between them and us?! Myosgard!

220
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,589
Our sister is in trouble...

221
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,591
They can get away with it!

222
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,594
Because they're pirates
and not responsible for any country!

223
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,180
Myosgard!

224
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,600
How dare you punch me the other day!

225
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:20,646
Kuma! Kill Myosgard!

226
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,739
Tontatta Combat!

227
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,492
Hasshoken Secret Art! Drill Dragon!

228
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,494
Leo-sama! Sai-sama!

229
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,497
-Don't do it!
-He's a Celestial Dragon!

230
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,966
Tail Hammer!

231
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,426
Nail!

232
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,559
Charlos!

233
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,730
They're doomed!

234
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:07,109
He must be dead! This is murder!

235
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,112
The murder of a Celestial Dragon!

236
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,948
The Marine Admirals will come!

237
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,881
No, Kuma-chan!

238
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:35,721
You don't have to follow
anyone's orders anymore!

239
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:39,850
Let's go home together!

240
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,268
What?!

241
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,854
What is a Giant doing here?!

242
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,105
Morley!

243
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,065
Karasu!

244
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,858
I got the keys from Sabo!

245
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,569
-What <i>is</i> he?!
-An intruder?!

246
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,989
That's Morley!
A captain of the Revolutionary Army!

247
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,741
Okay! I'll go down!

248
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,248
Son!

249
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,434
Let me ask you one more time.

250
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,435
What is the D?

251
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,524
{\an8}Leave. We have nothing more to say.

252
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,803
Imu-sama.

253
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,055
King Cobra is still here!

254
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,808
<i>Did he say Imu?!</i>

255
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,158
Lily...

256
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:22,262
<i>How far I have run</i>

257
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:29,895
<i>Without knowing it, I counted scars</i>

258
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:36,902
<i>A treasure map in my head all along</i>

259
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:43,408
<i>Still looking for the future</i>

260
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:50,123
<i>The real promise</i>

261
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:56,964
<i>Lies much deeper in my heart</i>

262
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,592
<i>A dream</i>

263
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:06,431
<i>That no one can catch up with</i>

264
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:11,728
<i>That's all I hold on to</i>

265
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:19,236
<i>To you who smiles like the sun</i>

266
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:26,159
<i>I'll sing the same song as that day</i>

267
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:33,208
<i>This wish I don't want to forget
Even when I grow up</i>

268
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:40,299
<i>Until it reaches you</i>

269
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:51,685
<i>"Dive into the Sea of Information!
The Punk Records Library!"</i>

270
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:58,692
Hi, I'm Lilith, one of the Satellites of
Dr. Vegapunk, the genius scientist!

271
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,820
I'm Edison, also Vegapunk!

272
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,740
Today we'll introduce this one!
Shirahoshi!

273
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,118
{\an8}Her father is King Neptune of
the Kingdom of Ryugu.

274
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,205
{\an8}Her mother is Queen Otohime. And she is
a princess of the Kingdom of Ryugu.

275
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:16,626
She was born on April 4th
and likes sea grape pasta!

276
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,381
To avoid the pirate Vander Decken IX's
persistent proposals

277
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,925
and long-distance attacks,

278
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,803
she'd been holed up
in a tower for a long time.

279
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,015
After she met Luffy, she went outside
for the first time in a while.

280
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:35,187
But Decken threw
an extremely massive ship, Noah, at her.

281
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:41,109
To keep Noah away from her island,
she summoned the Neptunians to stop it.

282
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,237
After her ability to communicate
with the Neptunians was awakened,

283
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:49,034
{\an8}she had to take on another name,
Poseidon, the Ancient Weapon.

284
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,661
Later, she gathered her courage
and traveled to the surface

285
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,872
to attend the Reverie.

286
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,750
Father-sama, I...

287
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:01,379
If possible, I want to live on land!

288
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:07,469
I just hope the kind-hearted Shirahoshi
won't be used as an Ancient Weapon.

289
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,638
That's it for today!

290
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:13,058
Now that you've seen it,
donate to our research fund!

291
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,685
See you next time!

292
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,194
<i>Surprised by the presence
sitting on the Empty Throne,</i>

293
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:27,948
<i>King Cobra prepares for death
as he learns the truth of the world.</i>

294
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:32,577
<i>Facing a cruel fate that he can't defy,
he entrusts Sabo</i>

295
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,831
<i>with the 800-year-old secret
of the Nefeltari Family!</i>

296
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,666
<i>On the next episode of</i> ONE PIECE<i>!</i>

297
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:41,419
<i>"The Entrusted Message!
King Cobra's Resolve"</i>

298
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,172
<i>I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!</i>
