<i>(Dream save us us) us, all of us</i>

3
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,235
<i>The end of a dream, the end of the sea</i>

4
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,946
<i>We all have different places we want to go</i>

5
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,449
<i>But first, we need</i>

6
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:36,911
<i>To make a shining legend out of ourselves</i>

7
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,665
{\an8}<i>Sparks fly, no limit
This is where it starts</i>

8
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,292
ONE PIECE<i>!!</i>

9
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,919
<i>All of us, I ask you travelers</i>

10
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,298
<i>Are your dreams still pure?</i>

11
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:56,681
<i>Sleepless cells are shaken and burst</i>

12
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:03,438
<i>Still, all of us
In the middle of an adventure</i>

13
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,940
{\an8}<i>All of us, I tell you travelers</i>

14
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,819
{\an8}<i>No such thing as a pointless fight</i>

15
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,032
<i>When random contexts</i>

16
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:17,827
<i>Start to make sense on their own</i>

17
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:24,542
<i>The threads of time are spun back together</i>

18
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:29,798
{\an8}<i>The world keeps changing along with us</i>

19
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,342
<i>(All of us) us, us</i>

20
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:37,806
<i>(Dream save us us) us, all of us</i>

00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:49,317
<i>"The Entrusted Message!

22
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,077
<i>No one is supposed to sit there.</i>

23
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:12,298
<i>No one is allowed to run the world
at their sole discretion!</i>

24
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,054
There are two things
that I want to tell you...

25
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,516
and one thing to ask you, Cobra.

26
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,393
Who are you?!

27
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,397
The name Imu sounds familiar.

28
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:31,901
It must be a coincidence,
but among the First Twenty...

29
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,945
Don't be nosy...

30
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,114
I won't answer...

31
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,452
But I'll tell you what you want to know.

32
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,747
"D" is...

33
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,668
the name of the people
who once opposed us.

34
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:54,090
It has appeared
in various places in recent years...

35
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,636
in hollow shells who don't even know
the meaning of their own name.

36
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,972
But like everything else,

37
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:07,562
it stems from
Queen Lily's blunder 800 years ago...

38
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,730
Blunder?!

39
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:14,193
<i>Same with the scholars
who sniff around the 100-Year Void.</i>

40
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:20,283
<i>And the pirates who seek
the Ponegliffs to hunt treasure.</i>

41
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,078
If it weren't for Lily's mistake
on that day,

42
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,458
the loathsome artifacts
called the Ponegliffs

43
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,253
would not be scattered all over the world.

44
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,303
One damning hypothesis...

45
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,723
can be made about this past event.

46
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:49,062
Were the Ponegliffs unleashed
really by mistake?

47
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,191
Or was it planned?

48
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,199
The answer to that...

49
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,912
must be written in Lily's letter
that arrived in Alabasta.

50
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,290
Why have you...

51
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:14,629
been referring to her only as
Queen Lily of the Nefeltari Family...

52
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,339
all this time?

53
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:22,637
Say the full name on the letter
that the queen sent.

54
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:31,896
<i>This is it.</i>

55
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:37,318
<i>I don't think
I will be leaving this room alive.</i>

56
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,783
If I lie,
is there any chance you'll let me go?

57
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:49,247
The moment you saw Imu-<i>sama</i>,
your fate was sealed.

58
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,430
<i>He's right...</i>

59
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,974
<i>It's the biggest taboo in the world...</i>

60
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,364
<i>What's this situation?
It's obviously not normal.</i>

61
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,743
This is how it was signed.

62
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,750
The queen ruling the Kingdom of Alabasta
800 years ago was...

63
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,297
Nefeltari...

64
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,635
D. Lily.

65
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,930
"D"...

66
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,656
Fire Fist!

67
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,954
Rook Check!

68
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,377
Where did you come from?!

69
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,326
I was hoping
I'd be able to take you all down,

70
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,788
but I never expected to find hell
at the top of the world

71
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,848
How annoying!

72
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,689
You're... Luffy-<i>kun</i>'s...

73
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,732
brother, right?

74
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:30,116
You're a Revolutionary
but you're helping me?

75
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,953
Our enemies are
the ones who sit above the kings...

76
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,663
It's them.

77
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,999
How do you know Luffy?

78
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,586
He saved my life.

79
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,005
That's so Luffy.

80
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:55,516
Hold yourself together!
I'll get you out of...

81
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,696
Without me, you can make it.

82
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:12,200
It's too late for me. Leave me behind!

83
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,159
I'll save you!

84
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,872
There is something I discovered.

85
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,627
I don't want you to die here!

86
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,255
I need you to tell Luffy-<i>kun</i> and Vivi...

87
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,007
Luffy and Princess Vivi?!

88
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,470
Tell them that we share the moniker "D"!

89
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,638
What?

90
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,894
Is it a coincidence?

91
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,147
Is what a coincidence?

92
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,649
You both...

93
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,359
They're cooked!

94
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,028
Looks delicious!

95
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,030
Hey! You can't take two at once!

96
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,532
I'm hungry!

97
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,325
But you can't...

98
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,702
Yummy!

99
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,663
Gee, man...

100
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,502
Yeah, it's good!

101
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,419
Sabo.

102
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,588
You were just about to say something.

103
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,714
Yeah.

104
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:13,803
I wonder if it's a coincidence
that you both have "D" in your name.

105
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,012
"D"?

106
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,516
Monkey D. Luffy and Portgas D. Ace.

107
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,977
There's "D" in both.

108
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,020
Oh, yeah.

109
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,356
I don't give a damn about names.

110
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,609
Do you want a "D" initial, Sabo?

111
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,569
What?!

112
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,196
-Sa-D-Bo!
-Don't put it there!

113
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,739
I can put it wherever I like!

114
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,700
Sa-D-Bo! Sa-D-Bo!

115
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:50,172
I finally see the path Alabasta must take...

116
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,390
Stay with me, King Cobra!

117
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,058
Hold yourself together!

118
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,114
King Cobra!

119
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:36,969
King Cobra!

120
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,431
"The Ponegliffs..."

121
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,564
"Bear the flag of the dawn..."

122
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,486
"Nefeltari D. Lily."

123
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,322
I'm counting on you!

124
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,999
<i>I'm counting on you, Sabo-</i>kun<i>!</i>

125
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,046
King Cobra!

126
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,094
<i>Live on!</i>

127
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,595
<i>Oh, no!</i>

128
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,641
Who's there?

129
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,190
<i>H-He got killed!</i>

130
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,818
<i>Cobra is dead!</i>

131
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:20,197
<i>I never liked him,
but I'm not vile enough to celebrate!</i>

132
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,325
<i>I witnessed something terrible!</i>

133
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,880
<i>I came to know
the dark side of the World Government!</i>

134
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,715
<i>I didn't want to!</i>

135
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,383
<i>Who was that?!</i>

136
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,635
<i>I'm screwed!</i>

137
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,398
Who are you?!

138
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,695
King Wapol!

139
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,030
Is there something wrong?

140
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:05,159
I... didn't see anything!
I don't know anything!

141
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,998
The council has already started
in the round table chamber.

142
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,124
Let us walk you there.

143
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,711
N-No! I don't wanna stay here!

144
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:16,670
Wait!

145
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,008
King Wapol!

146
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,052
W-What's wrong with him?

147
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,764
GRAND COUNCIL ROUND TABLE CHAMBER

148
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:33,646
King Cobra and King Wapol
are not here yet...

149
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,817
We just received word. Both of them
wanted you to carry on without them...

150
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,696
I guess King Cobra used up all his energy
with his impassioned speech.

151
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,244
He's clearly satisfied now
that the Seven Warlords' matter is closed.

152
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,246
That must be it!

153
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,167
Okay, let's take care of
the remaining agenda items.

154
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,294
First, the Four-Nation Alliance
in the North Blue

155
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,504
is calling for independence...

156
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,466
<i>Moonfish mambo! Shake, shake!</i>

157
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,804
Cheer up, Shirahoshi.
Dancing will make you feel better!

158
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,847
Thank you.

159
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,266
Shirahoshi.

160
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,351
The council will eventually be over.

161
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,853
Let's wait at the Red Port
where those idiots won't come.

162
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:15,896
Okay.

163
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,817
What's wrong?

164
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:24,238
I want to speak with Vivi-<i>sama</i>.

165
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,866
I wonder where she went...

166
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,417
Why are you doing this?! Untie me!

167
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,255
Who ordered this? I'll tell the world
everything that happened here!

168
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,509
Whoa-whoa, you're too honest.

169
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,345
No one would want to set you free
after hearing that.

170
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,431
You really are a feisty woman!

171
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,182
JABRA, CIPHER POL "AIGIS" ZERO

172
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,144
I'm sorry...

173
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,022
but no one will help you, Princess.

174
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:02,401
You'll just be reported as missing
and kept as a pet by someone.

175
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,111
KALIFA, CIPHER POL "AIGIS" ZERO

176
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,989
Nothing is certain in life!

177
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,576
Now you feel the pathos of living!

178
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,077
KUMADORI, CIPHER POL "AIGIS" ZERO

179
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,456
Hey, you just looked at Kumadori's cards.

180
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,207
BLUENO, CIPHER POL "AIGIS" ZERO

181
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,670
I wouldn't go that far to win.

182
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,047
Come clean.

183
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,007
A pair of sixes.

184
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,259
FUKUROU, CIPHER POL "AIGIS" ZERO

185
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,969
Is Shirahoshi okay?

186
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,306
What?! You're worried about someone else
in this situation?

187
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,354
Looks like there was
another incident earlier,

188
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,481
but, well, as it turns out, she's fine.

189
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,191
Good...

190
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:47,029
Those who beat up the Celestial Dragon
that tried to kidnap the mermaid...

191
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,241
We're Straw Hat Luffy's subordinates!

192
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,288
We're not afraid of the Celestial Dragons!

193
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:05,547
They proudly declared themselves winners
and threw the plaza into turmoil.

194
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,344
On top of that, in the Land of the Gods,

195
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:15,099
Fujitora helped the Revolutionaries
free the slaves,

196
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,851
so Ryokugyu got pissed
and they got into a big fight...

197
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,153
Hey, Fujitora!

198
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,865
Do you know what you're doing?!

199
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,701
Did you forget?

200
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:37,204
I told you what I wanted to destroy
was the system.

201
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,916
You're the one who forgot something!
We're the Navy!

202
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,293
Nothing more, nothing less!

203
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,879
I don't want to lie.

204
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,718
Okay, okay,
so you're not gonna give an inch...

205
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,972
Cut the crap, Fujitora!

206
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:07,067
I'm not gonna forgive you!

207
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,281
Jeez...

208
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:16,160
I don't want them to give us
any more trouble.

209
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,789
This Reverie is a mess.

210
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,460
Well, that's none of your business,
Princess.

211
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,712
Why don't you worry about yourself?

212
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:31,091
<i>I have to do something
or I'll be kept as a pet, too?</i>

213
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,260
<i>Give me a break!</i>

214
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,725
What's that?

215
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,109
Someone's...

216
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:04,124
Help me! I didn't see anything!

217
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,125
Wapol?!

218
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,960
Get out of my way!

219
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:07,795
<i>Oh!</i>

220
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,884
Move out of my way!

221
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,886
I don't wanna...

222
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,847
get caught!

223
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,021
What was that about?

224
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,523
That was King Wapol, right?

225
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,485
Oh, damn!

226
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,489
Vivi's gone!

227
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,282
What?!

228
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,492
No!

229
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,077
What happened?!

230
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,954
Don't tell me...

231
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,414
She escaped!

232
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,473
Thanks, Wapol!

233
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,851
Vivi! When did you get here?!

234
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,394
You helped me escape!

235
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,187
You idiot! Get out of there!

236
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,314
Why are you in such a hurry?

237
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,732
Don't ask!

238
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,609
You're even shedding tears!

239
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,071
Don't ask!

240
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:22,953
Hey!

241
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,248
How do you do? Kinderella-<i>sama</i>.

242
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,875
Have you seen my husband?

243
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,252
No, I have not seen him...

244
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,719
...Oh!
...King Wapol!

245
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:43,182
Darling, I've been looking for you!
Where have you been?!

246
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,444
Who is that young woman?!

247
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,113
Hey, Wapol! How far are you gonna go?!

248
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,448
I'm gonna go as far as I can!

249
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,159
To the end of the world
where no one'll follow me!

250
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,245
I'll come with you! Take me!

251
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:12,044
<i>Is he eloping with her?!</i>

252
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:22,221
<i>How far I have run</i>

253
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:29,853
<i>Without knowing it, I counted scars</i>

254
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:36,860
<i>A treasure map in my head all along</i>

255
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:43,367
<i>Still looking for the future</i>

256
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:50,082
<i>The real promise</i>

257
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:56,922
<i>Lies much deeper in my heart</i>

258
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,550
<i>A dream</i>

259
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:06,390
<i>That no one can catch up with</i>

260
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:11,687
<i>That's all I hold on to</i>

261
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:19,194
<i>To you who smiles like the sun</i>

262
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:26,118
<i>I'll sing the same song as that day</i>

263
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:33,166
<i>This wish I don't want to forget
Even when I grow up</i>

264
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:40,257
<i>Until it reaches you</i>

265
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:51,643
<i>"Dive into the Sea of Information!
The Punk Records Library!"</i>

266
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:58,567
Hi, I'm Lilith, one of the Satellites of
Dr. Vegapunk, the genius scientist!

267
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,778
I'm Edison, also Vegapunk!

268
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,699
Today we'll introduce this one!
Nefeltari Cobra!

269
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:10,537
{\an8}He was the 12th king of the Kingdom
of Alabasta and Vivi's father!

270
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:15,292
{\an8}He was born on February 13th
and liked a dessert called knafeh!

271
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,920
{\an8}He was a great ruler who believed that
"a country is its people."

272
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:23,300
Even when he was suspected of stealing
rain through Crocodile's trickery,

273
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,762
he didn't try to crush
the rebels by force.

274
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:31,767
When blackmailed into giving up
the location of the Ancient Weapon Pluton,

275
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,270
Cobra tried to sacrifice himself
to kill Crocodile.

276
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:39,024
But he was saved
by Luffy's heroic actions.

277
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:42,944
Overcome this war and survive!

278
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,032
Kingdom of Alabasta!

279
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,870
Later, Cobra attended the Reverie,

280
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:55,540
and after a heated debate,
he won the approval of many monarchs...

281
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:59,294
to pass the abolition of
the Seven Warlords system!

282
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:02,172
He was a great king,
both stern yet playful!

283
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:07,302
With this decision,
the world began to move even faster!

284
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,221
That's it for today!

285
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,724
Now that you've seen it,
donate to our research fund!

286
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,519
See you next time!

287
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:25,570
<i>Vivi and Wapol attempt to flee
the turbulent Holy Land Mary Geoise.</i>

288
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:30,200
<i>Sabo heads for the Kingdom of Lulusia
with King Cobra's words in his heart.</i>

289
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:36,039
<i>And as if to corner them,
the Five Elders' attack finally begins!</i>

290
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,499
<i>On the next episode of</i> ONE PIECE<i>!</i>

291
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:41,878
<i>"The World Is Shaken! The Ruler's Judgment
and the Five Elders' Actions!"</i>

292
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,422
<i>I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!</i>
