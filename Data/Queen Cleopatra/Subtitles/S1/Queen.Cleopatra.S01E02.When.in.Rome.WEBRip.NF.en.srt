[Colleen] Cleopatra's story
is so significant

[Islam] Cleopatra gives birth

in her early 20's, probably around 22.

34
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,280
{\an8}And his name, Caesarion, Little Caesar.

35
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,480
{\an8}Perfect name.

36
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,320
[Islam] Caesarion embodies
two great cultures,

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,640
two great civilizations.

38
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,640
There is no other child
like him in the world.

39
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,880
{\an8}It was not a big deal

40
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,160
{\an8}that she was not married
to the baby's father.

41
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,560
[Debora] And considering
that she was a ruler

42
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,520
and then the baby's father is a ruler,

43
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
this child could be

44
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,760
the one that really unites Rome and Egypt.

45
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,840
[Colleen] With the birth of Caesarion,

46
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,320
Cleopatra really has a chance

47
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,840
to continue her dynasty.

and her brother is now deceased.

53
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,440
Not a sibling that Cleopatra
has to worry about any longer.

54
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,560

Cleopatra has a problem.

58
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,480
Cleopatra's problem is
her sister, Arsinoe.

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,320
[Colleen] After Julius Caesar
captures Arsinoe,

he brings her back to Rome
to be part of his triumph.

63
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,880
Part of the official celebration
of his victory in Egypt.

64
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,839
{\an8}Cleopatra has exacted a promise
from Julius Caesar

65
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,600
that he will kill her.

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,160
[Shelley] She would have been about 17.

68

He parades Arsinoe.

69
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,000
[Shelley]
And the people of Rome are appalled.

70
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,480
She's truly a child.

71
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,800
[Shelley]
Why are you humiliating her this way?

72
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,760
[tense music]

73
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,280
So the people rise up against Caesar.

74
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,480
And so he thinks better of executing her.

75
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,320

00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,800
[Colleen]
The people of Rome revere Caesar.

78
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,880
But if they disagree
with one of his choices,

79
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,800
he has to walk that line.

80
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,640
Caesar commands
that Arsinoe's life be spared.

81
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,440
{\an8}[Colleen] She's exiled to what is now
modern-day Turkey at the city of Ephesus.

[ominous music]

83
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,840
Caesar really betrays Cleopatra.

84
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,680
She assumes
that her sister Arsinoe is dead

85
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,800
and no longer a threat to her throne.

86
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,800
[tense music]

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,880
[bird chirps]

88
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,760
When Cleopatra learns
that Arsinoe is still alive,

89
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,640
she is livid.

90
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,080
Because she knows
the threat she represents.

91
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,040
She knows you can't trust your siblings.

92
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,640
You can't trust them.

93
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,480
[Shelley] Cleopatra's, like,

94
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,240
"Just give me a moment
to think of a plan."

95
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,840
And that's the thing about Cleopatra.

96
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,480
She always has a plan.

99
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,280
The baby… probably about a year old,

100
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,360
when she decides
to take Caesarion to Rome,

101
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,760
hoping, praying,
that Caesar will claim paternity,

102
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,880
will claim Caesarion as his son,

103
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,480
but more importantly, as his heir.

104
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,080
[Shelley] This will lend legitimacy
not just to Caesarion,

105
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,080
but also to Cleopatra.

106
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,440
And she, she wants that,

107
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,240
but she mostly wants it for Caesarion.

108
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,320
[Colleen] If Julius Caesar
recognizes Caesarion as his son,

109
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,680
this allows Cleopatra
to sidestep Arsinoe entirely.

110

[indistinct chatter]

111
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,920

her trusted confidantes,

Charmion and Iras.

113
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,720
She has with her,
her second brother-husband,

114
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,120
Ptolemy the XIV,

115
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,520
maybe feeling like he was a third wheel.

116
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,840
Cleopatra was in Rome to be with Caesar,

117
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,240
he's got to come along
because, you know, he's a co-pharaoh.

[Islam] Rome, at this stage,
is the most powerful of empires.

127

Rome has made advances

{\an8}from architecture to arts,
becoming the capital of the world.

{\an8}And their empire is expanded.

{\an8}It's going around
what we would today term Western Europe.

131

{\an8}It's going all the way to Asia.

132
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,800

He's also a hero to many of the Romans.

Caesar installs her, their child,
and their entourage,

in his garden villa on the Janiculum Hill.

151
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,600
[Shelley] Caesar had a Roman wife.

152

In Cleopatra's mind, "It's fine."

153
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,880
Caesar was known for his affairs.

154
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,720
The fact that he was married
wouldn't have bothered Cleopatra.

155

And although monogamy
was expected on the high political level

that we're talking about
with Caesar and Cleopatra,

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,720
Also that Caesar
is going to fashion himself

356
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,880
as a polygamist,

357
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,040
so then he can have a Roman wife,

358
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,040
he can have an Egyptian wife,

359
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,760
he can have a Greek wife.

He's now in bed, literally,
both metaphorically and literally

362
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,800
with somebody from a foreign country

363
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,960
and a country that was dependent on Rome.

364
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,040
This power battles between Egypt and Rome,

365
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,280
it's sort of now been flipped

366
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,280
and Cleopatra was making all the calls.

367
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,360
[Shelley] He erects a statue made of gold.

368
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,120
And it's dedicated to Isis slash Venus.

369
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,640
But it's in the likeness of Cleopatra.

370
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,360
The Romans did not like the idea
of turning people into gods.

371
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,640
Most Romans were probably appalled.

372
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,720
They believed she must have had
some kind of control or power over him.

373
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,200
[Shelley] But the truth of the matter is,

374
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,640
she's not entirely happy.

375
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,040
She doesn't get 100 percent
of what she wants.

376
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,400
[Colleen] One of Cleopatra's main goals
in going to Rome

377
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,240
is to have Julius Caesar
recognize his son Caesarion.

378
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,440
That is one thing
that Cleopatra does not accomplish.

<i>because she'd been away
from her own country for so long.</i>

383
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,720
[Shelley] Cleopatra feels very close
to the, uh, Egyptian people.

384
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,640
And she wants the Egyptian people

385
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,840
to know that she cares about them

386
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,760

While Cleopatra is back in Egypt,

tensions continue to rise in Rome.

390
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,960
[tense music]

391
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,400
[Colleen] In 44 BCE,
Julius Caesar requests

392
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,560
to be appointed dictator for life.

393
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,800
There had been
so much political instability

394
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,440
that the Senate grants his request.

395
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,040
[Colleen] He is now dictator
for the remainder of his life.

396
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,120
[intense music]

397
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,680
He is at, sort of,
the height of his power,

398
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,240
but that also means
that he's also at a tipping point.

399
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,760
[tense music]

400
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,960
[Colleen] Julius Caesar is the first Roman
to be appointed dictator for life.

401
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,960
He puts his portrait on coinage.

402
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,200
He wears purple robes,
sits in ornate thrones,

403
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,280
and even has a statue
dedicated to himself as a god.

404
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,760
[Colleen] Romans begin to get the sense

405
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,520
that Julius Caesar
wants to be king to Cleopatra's queen,

406
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,320
and this idea is anathema
to Republican Rome.

407
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,720
It's political suicide

408
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:19,400
to try to become explicitly a king.

409
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,080

410
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,760

is a prime chance for Julius Caesar

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,120

the kind of person he is.

412
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,520
[Islam] A humble person
who doesn't want to be the king.

[indistinct chatter]

414
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,040
Mark Antony is essentially a commoner
who's risen through the ranks

415
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,680
to become this important figure
in the Roman army

416
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,000
and to become somebody
who's very much trusted by Julius Caesar.

417
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,600
[Shelley] Mark Antony approaches him

418

this is a moment where

432
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,240
it's becoming clear
that he's cooking something up.

433
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,040
[Sally-Ann] He was separating himself
from the other elite

434
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,200
and almost starting to take control.

435
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,200
[Colleen] A faction of senators
see Caesar be made dictator for life

436
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,600
as an affront
to the republican values of Rome.

[soft tense music]

441
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,680

she needs to be extremely careful

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,720

that she finds herself in.

[Caesar exhales]

444
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,280
[Islam] Every day that passes
in Caesarion's life,

445
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,200
he's becoming more of a threat to Rome.

446
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,520
The older he gets,

447
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,480
the more likely Cleopatra is to raise him

448
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,840
as the future king, an emperor.

449
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,920
[Shelley] She wanted Caesarion
to be recognized by Julius Caesar

450
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,720
and to be written
into his will as his heir.

451
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,560
The number one thing
that Caesarion is to her

452
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,240
is an ace in that hand of poker
that she's playing from,

453
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,320
if Julius Caesar
is able to hold onto his power.

454
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,840
[Colleen] Because of Julius Caesar's
popularity with the people

455
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,680
and his growing power,

456
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,160
the political elite are threatened

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,760
These politicians are really concerned

459
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,440
that Caesar is going to become an autocrat

460
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,880
because of the influence of Cleopatra.

461
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,360
[Shelley] Cleopatra's presence in Rome

462
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,640

the ammunition they need.

Cleopatra expects
that this is gonna be Caesarion.

532
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,200
[soft tense music]

533
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,000
[Mark Antony]
Octavian, Caesar's great nephew.

534
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,160
He named him heir.

535
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,320
Why would he name someone
no one has ever met

536
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,280
when he has an heir?

537
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,920
-Did you see for yourself?
-I did.

538
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,160
Caesar has a son.

539
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,520
A son that I birthed.

540
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,600
A legitimate heir.

541
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,920
I need to speak to the Senate.

542
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,040
What matters is what Caesar wrote
and he wrote that.

543
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,960
You were like a son to him.

544
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,600
What did he leave you?

545
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
[clears throat]

546
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,200
There's a gathering at the Senate.

547
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,720
[inhales]
I need to be there.

548
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,480
Iras?

549
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,600
[Shelley] So it's shocking to her
that here is his natural son

550
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,400
who is not named as an heir.

551
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,320
[Colleen] We might assume
that if Octavian inherits Caesar's wealth,

552
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,560
that he's also going
to inherit his office.

553
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,200
But Republican Rome
has a representative government

554
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,360
and there are still
other power players in the mix.

555
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:18,600
[Shelley] Word is sent to Octavian
to tell him that he is the heir.

556
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,800
Mark Antony tries
to gather his supporters,

557
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,560
so there's gonna be a little bit
of a power play and some saber rattling.

558
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,360
[Colleen] Cleopatra departs Rome
after Caesar's assassination.

559
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,440
We can imagine
that she is devastated by her loss.

560
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,200
She's not only lost a lover and a friend,

561
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,160
but also her main political alliance.

562
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,440
[soft tense music]

563
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,280
[Colleen] Caesar's death
is not Cleopatra's only problem.

564
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,160
[keys jingling]

565
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,080
[Shelley] Her sister Arsinoe,
who is supposed to be imprisoned.

566
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,360
However, she makes an alliance
with the governor of Cyprus,

567
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,679
who breaks her out.

568
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,040
Because of her alliance
with the governor of Cyprus,

569
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,800
Arsinoe is freed from prison.

570
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,040
This enables her
to conspire with her brother Ptolemy

571
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,679
against Cleopatra

572
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,920
in an attempt to gain the throne.

573
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,679
[insects chirping]

574
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,280
Why am I learning about Arsinoe
and the Cyprian Governor

575
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,199
from a bureaucrat's wife?

576
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,080
Maybe I should hire her
as an advisor instead.

577
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,199
[Cleopatra snorts]

578
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,639
[Ammonios] I wouldn't.

579
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,480
She gives away
as much information as she gets.

580
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,080
And we let her?

581
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,280
We give her enough bait to lure a catch.

582
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,720
But we never take our eyes off her.

583
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,760
Understood.

584
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,400
The only way out of that temple
is through me or with an army.

585
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,800
Well, she's got an army.

586
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,240
Uh, trying to get an army.

587
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,240
How worried should I be?

588
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,680
I'll let you know
when it's time to be on the offensive.

589
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,680
[taps]

590
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,000
Make it happen.

591
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,520
Cleopatra could have had Arsinoe
assassinated herself,

592
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,920
but to some extent she's protected
because she's out of Egypt at this point.

593
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,920
[murmuring]

594
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,320
[Shelley] Arsinoe goes
and makes an alliance with her brother,

595
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,320
Ptolemy the XIV.

596
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,800
Even though Ptolemy the XIV
is only a child,

597
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,640
he could very easily
become a rallying point

598
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,040
for opposition to Cleopatra.

599
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,360
Why?

600
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,600
Why can't we all just get along?

601
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,160
She cannot permit anything
to come between Caesarion

602
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,400
and what she sees
as his rightful, uh, position.

603
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,840
And so she takes immediate action.

604
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,040
[creaking]

605
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,280
Ptolemy the XIV, um, becomes unwell

606
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,360
and, um, and he passes away, he dies.

607
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,880
[somber music]

608
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,840
[Cleopatra] Wait.

609
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,800
May you become one with the gods.

610
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,480
You may begin.

611
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,160
[somber music]

612
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,320
[Sally-Ann] I think it's highly likely

613
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,120
that Cleopatra removed her brother
from the equation.

614
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,240
He's just too big a threat,
so he is executed.

615
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,560
[Colleen] There can only be one king.

616
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,480
And her brother, Ptolemy, has to die

617
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,280
so that she can elevate
her own son, Caesarion, to co-regent.

618
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:44,720
Although this seems
a horrific thing to do to us moderns,

619
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,240
it would have actually been
almost a typical family solution.

620
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,600
She's lost a brother and a husband,

621
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,800
but she has gained a tremendous amount
of security as queen of Egypt.

622
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,920
[warriors clamoring]

623
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,960
[Islam] After Caesar's assassination,

624
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,520
we essentially have a civil war.

625
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,800
We have a polarized Roman elite,
the assassins,

626
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,040
and those who are trying
to bring the assassins down.

627
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,360
Mark Antony and Octavian,
who joined forces at that stage.

628
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,840
Three years after the assassination
of Julius Caesar,

629
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,760
Cleopatra has another chance
to forge an alliance with Rome.

630
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:27,520
Mark Antony requests her presence

631
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,520
for a conference
regarding, uh, Egypt's position

632
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,160
within the power-sharing community

633
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,760
of the eastern part of the Roman Empire.

634
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,160
Mark Antony has received intelligence

635
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,280
that Cleopatra has given aid

636
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,880
to some of the conspirators.

637
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,160
[Cleopatra] Well?

638
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,360
What?

639
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,760
[Colleen] Mark Antony needs
to meet Cleopatra

640
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,680
to determine
if she's been helping his enemies,

641
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,920
the men who assassinated Caesar.

642
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,080
I told you.

643
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,440
Cleopatra is the pharaoh of Egypt.

644
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,160
[Shelley] Cleopatra does not
answer summons

645
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,120
from the likes of Mark Antony.

646
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,720
For weeks,

647
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,560
Mark Antony keeps sending her summons.

648
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,720
[sighs]

649
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,200
[Shelley] "Come to Tarsus."

[inhales]

651
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,480
Tell Mark Antony
I accept his invitation to meet.

652
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,280
Tell him I accept.

653
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,040
What?

654
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,960
Do as I say.

655
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,760
[Islam] She needs someone
she can trust as an ally,

656
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,400
somebody who will be able to provide

657
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,760
some protection to Alexandria
if it's needed

658
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,680
because of attacks from Cyprus.

659
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,440
But at the end of the day, Mark Antony

660
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,480
does have military power.

661
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,640
[tense music]

662
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,840

in what is now southern Turkey.

In anger, Mark Antony goes to the ship.

[Colleen] Cleopatra dresses herself
like the goddess Venus.

668

She has set a goal
of conquering Mark Antony,

669
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,600
and this opulent ship
will be her battlefield.

670
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,760
You and Octavian summoned me here.

671
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
You know he's taking the name Caesar?

672
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,280
[Cleopatra] Hm.

673
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,160
That's bold.

674
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,840
The Roman people spared Arsinoe.

675
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,000
I need to make sure
that doesn't happen again.

[Jacquelyn]
Mark Antony needed Egyptian wealth.

691
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,680
She was demonstrating
the value of an alliance with Egypt,

692
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,960
that she could bring wealth
in a way that he needed.

693
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,040
Cleopatra sees an opportunity
in Mark Antony.

694
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,080
He is another Roman of considerable power,

695
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,360
somebody to continue
where she left off with Caesar.

696
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,320
She was using these relationships
quite strategically

697
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,520
in order to elevate her own status

698
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,160
and protect herself and her country.

699
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,640
It was precisely because she was a woman,

700
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,600
because she could have children
with powerful Roman men,

701
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,360
form both military, diplomatic,
and romantic allegiances

702
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,720
that gave her an element of power

are wrong.

00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,440
[Colleen] It is not Cleopatra
who is helping Caesar's assassins,

710
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,040
but rather, her sister Arsinoe.

[Shelley] During pillow talk,
Cleopatra says, "I think

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,480
it would be the mark
of a strong Roman leader

716
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:58,680
if Arsinoe met an untimely death."

What we really see in Cleopatra
is a survivor.

723
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,880
It's somebody who will do anything
in order to survive.

724
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,960
[Colleen] Cleopatra's alliance
with Mark Antony

725
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,800
allows her to triumph
over her final sibling.

726
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,000
[Colleen] And with Arsinoe's death,

727
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:40,480
Cleopatra is the final Ptolemaic ruler
still standing.

[rhythmic thumping]

729
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,960
But Cleopatra still has
an even bigger rival, Octavian,

730
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,320
and he is not going to stop
until all of her plans are destroyed.
