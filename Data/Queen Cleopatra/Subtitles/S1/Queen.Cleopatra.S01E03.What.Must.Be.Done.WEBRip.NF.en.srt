You cheat.

27
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,280
The relationship
between Cleopatra and Mark Antony

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,680
definitely begins
as a pragmatic political arrangement.

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,560
But it seems to quickly develop
into something more

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,280
where there really is love between them.

31
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,960
While Mark Antony is in Alexandria,
he's having a great time there.

32
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,479
But he's also gonna be uneasy
because in Rome,

33
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,800
{\an8}there is an agreement now
that power is being shared.

34
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,040
[Islam] Octavian pretty much
holds the West.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,280
Mark Antony, the East.

36
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,040
[Islam] They both have ambitions

37
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,480
to get the other person
out of the picture.

I am here.

41
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,480
[Mark Antony] Nothing is wrong.

42
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
Don't do that.

43
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,520
-[Mark Antony] Do what?
-Lie to me.

44
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,160
I'm not.

45
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,480
You can't share my bed and lie to me.

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,720
It's Octavian.
[sighs]

48
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,400
There are rumors he's threatening
to break the alliances,

49
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,960
making moves of his own.

What sort of moves?

It isn't clear yet.

53
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,960
Then why are you waiting?

54
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,440
Mark, you should be in Rome right now
finding out for yourself.

55
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,120
I'll not give him the satisfaction.

56
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,040
How dare he try to upset an alliance
that you made possible?

57
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,320
No, Mark, you need to go back to Rome

58
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,240
and put that little bird back in his cage
before he grows wings

59
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,600
and tries to destroy
everything you've fought for.

[instrumental music]

61
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,960
[Shelley] Mark Antony stays away too long.

He isn't doing Roman business.

[soft upbeat music]

64
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,200
{\an8}That leaves Octavian in Rome,

{\an8}in the seat of power, close to the Senate.

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:14,640

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,000
[Shelley] Octavian is beginning
to undermine

Mark Antony's reputation in Rome,

76
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,200
hinting that the same thing that happened
to Julius Caesar with Cleopatra

77
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,240
is now happening to him.

78
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,240
[Shelley] Cleopatra persuades him.

79
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,440
"Go back to Rome.

80
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Make sure Octavian is under your thumb

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,840
Cleopatra is pregnant.

[soft music]

87
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,680
[Islam] Mark Antony may have been
infatuated with Cleopatra,

88
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,640
but when it comes to marriage,

89
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,600
he picks what he thinks

90
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,080
is the most politically sound person.

[panting]

99
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,440
[Islam] It's somebody
who's related directly to Octavian.

100
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,320
It's someone who ensures, or so he thinks,

101
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,200
that Octavian will be on his side.

105
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,320
[Debora] In ancient Egypt,
when she was having a child,

106
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,080
that was considered
a very dangerous time for a woman.

107
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,960
{\an8}Not only is she at risk
of losing the baby and losing her life,

108
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,880
{\an8}but the country itself
is at risk of losing its ruler.

[Shelley] Cleopatra gives birth to twins.

113
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,280
It was seen as something divine.

114
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,720
It was seen as a gift from… from the gods.

115
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,280
And it cemented Cleopatra's image as Isis.

116
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,360
[dramatic music]

117
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:35,920
Cleopatra knows the Roman tradition
of political marriages.

118
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,760
She understands
why Mark Antony had to do this.

119
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,920
[Sally-Ann] Mark Antony marries Octavia
for political reasons,

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,240
to appease her brother Octavian.

121
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,760
It's, again, a strategic move.

122
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,400
[cries]

123
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,280
In Cleopatra's mind, it's fine.

124
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,280
Go ahead, take a Roman wife. Sure.

125
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,680
But he doesn't come back for three years.

126
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,800
What's that? What's that? Yeah.

127
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,520
[Shelley] Caesar had a Roman wife.

128
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,120
He still wrote to her,

129
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,960
took an interest in their child.

130
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,920
Mark Antony, not a word.

131
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,920
Not a word.

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,960
Even after Cleopatra delivers twins.

133
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,600
Not a word.

134
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,480
[horses neighing]

135
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,760
Essentially, he ghosts her. He's gone.

[dramatic music]

137
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,400
[Islam] But during that time,

138
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,039
Cleopatra turns Egypt's fortunes around.

139
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,440
She's increased taxes a bit,

140
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,960
but she's also increased exports.

141
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,440
She's increased employment.

142
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:02,840
And suddenly, Egypt's situation
is looking very prosperous.

143
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,560
[Shelley] The sources on Rome
don't have any details about…

144
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,480
what Cleopatra did during the three years.

145
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,240
But from Arabic accounts,
Egypt was thriving.

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,520
The economy was, like, booming.

147
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,160
The people loved Cleopatra.

148
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,960
She was seen as an effective leader.

149

[Colleen] During those three years

153
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,320
that Mark Antony stays away
from Cleopatra,

154
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,120
he's busy building an Eastern Empire
and waging war against Parthia,

155
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,200
a major power
in what is now modern-day Iran.

156
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,280
[tense music]

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,560
[Jacquelyn] Mark Antony wants to be able
to gain control of the Parthians

158
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,320
{\an8}because this will elevate
his own standing within the Roman Empire

159
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,560
{\an8}and establish him
as a significant power player

160
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,120
{\an8}in association with Octavian.

161
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,680
[Jacquelyn] The Romans have been trying
to conquer the Parthians for a while

162
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,040
and haven't been successful,

163
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,760
and so, that would be
an important establishment for him.

164
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,240
[Islam] He thought he was going to be
supported by Octavian,

165
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,200
but Octavian doesn't really help him
in the way that Antony expected.

166
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,640
He needs military support.

167
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,920
He needs money.

168
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,440
[Colleen] Mark Antony has the expectation

169
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,040
that by marrying Octavia,
Octavian's sister,

170
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,800
he's going to get
what he needs from Octavian

171
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,680
for the Parthian campaign.

172
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,000
However, Octavian only provides him
with two legions,

173
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,040
and so he still requires more forces

174
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,800
if he's going to have
a successful invasion of the East.

175
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,560
[soldiers yelling]

176
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,440
[Colleen] As conflict intensifies,

177
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,000
Mark Antony knows
that now he needs to seek alliances,

178
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,880
and Cleopatra has to be top on his list.

179
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,640
[Islam] Mark Antony summons Cleopatra.

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,200
He can't rely on Octavian,

181
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,320
and he's realized
that he does need Cleopatra.

182
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,520
[Colleen]
After Mark Antony summons Cleopatra,

183
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,640
she travels to Antioch in Syria.

184
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,720
[Islam] At this stage,

185
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,720
Cleopatra does have the upper hand,

186
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,400
and she's the one who can make demands.

187
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
[wind gusting]

188
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,080
[Islam]
She wants old Ptolemaic territories,

189
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,320
and she wants to ensure

190
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,920
that these territories
can return to her kingdom.

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,680
Those territories being Cyprus
and Crete, especially.

192
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,760
[tense music]

193
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,960
Please clear the room.

194
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,840
-Cleopatra--
-No.

195
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,240
You don't get to explain.

196
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,120
You had three years.

197
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,920
Not a word.

198
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,720
Not to me

199
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,200
or the children.

200
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,760
The children, did you bring them?

201
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,480
[scoffs]

202
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,200
Did I bring them?

203
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,280
To you?

204
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,400
I know the reason you summoned me here.

205
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
I know…

206
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,760
about your sorry little dance
with Octavian.

207
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,840
I have spies of my own.

208
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,200
I know you need my help.

209
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,320
Why should I give it to you?

210
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,000
[Mark Antony] You're right.

211
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,040
You're absolutely right.

212
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,000
What we're seeing
are two power players coming together

213
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,840
to try to figure out how to best promote,

214
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,640
uh, each other's mutual interests.

215
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,280
And so Mark Antony needs Cleopatra

216
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,000
for his ongoing structuring
of the Eastern Roman Empire.

217
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,880
He doesn't have enough men.

218
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,520
He doesn't have enough supplies.

219
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,960
She needs him
for her associations with Rome.

220
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,960
[Shelley] She gives him a list of demands.

221
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
And it's basically,

222
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:58,280
"I want everything back
that Julius Caesar took away."

223
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,160
[Shelley] She wants Mark Antony
to claim the twins as his

224
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,880
and also be given territories
to be in charge of.

225
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:15,200
And also Caesarion, she wants recognized
as the son of Julius Caesar.

226
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,360
That's still important.

227
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,200
[insects chirping]

228
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,440
[Cleopatra] I want it.

229
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,600
I want it all.

230
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,160
Cleopatra and Mark Antony
spend an entire winter

231
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,680
in Antioch, Syria, negotiating.

232
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,200
What Cleopatra wants

233
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,480
is to restore the glory
of the Ptolemaic Kingdom.

234
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,840
So, I thought about your demands,

235
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,240
about everything you want.

236
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,880
Everything I deserve.

237
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,160
Everything Egypt deserves.

238
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,080
Well, it's still an enormous price.

239
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,760
For an enormous ask
which only Egypt can provide.

240
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,920
I'm not here to argue with you, Pharoah.

241
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,560
Why are you here then?

242
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,720
Why am I here?

243
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,360
[sighs]

244
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,840
[breathes deeply]

245
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,240
[sighs]

246
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,280
I'm here because you win.

247
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,400
I win what?

248
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,160
Everything.

249
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,800
Why?

250
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,840
Because of us.

251
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,440
Can I really trust you?

252
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,560
I can't share your bed
and lie to you, now can I?

253
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,680
Your rules.

254
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,200
This means that Cleopatra
is more powerful than ever.

255
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,480
{\an8}She's now restored
the Ptolemaic Kingdom to its former glory.

256
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,280
{\an8}And in return, Mark Antony
gets the military manpower that he needs

257
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,960
{\an8}for his Parthian campaign.

258
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,240
[Jacquelyn] Egypt regaining control
of these territories

259
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,240
allowed Egypt to prosper
in truly remarkable ways.

260
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,080
The more a nation owns land,

261
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,560
the wealthier the core
of that empire becomes.

262
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,600
So, these lands would have added
substantial power, wealth,

263
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,920
and security to Cleopatra,

264
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
which are key elements
that she always wants,

265
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,040
that every Ptolemaic King wants.

266
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,880
[birds chirping]

267
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
[Shelley] And it's at this point,

268
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,400
Mark Antony meets for the first time

269
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,000
his children by Cleopatra.

270
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,840
My little god. Hello.

271
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,120
Hello to you.

272
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,560
-Are you gonna come here too?
-Yeah. That's it.

273
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,480
[Mark Antony] My perfect little gods.
Look at you both.

274
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,960
Look at you both.

275
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,600
[Shelley] And from all accounts,

276
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,000
he is absolutely besotted with them.

277
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,000
[gasps]

278
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,440
[Colleen] He does name his twins
the Sun and the Moon.

279
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,640
Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene.

280
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,359
[laughter]

281
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,160
Mark Antony and Cleopatra
are elevating their children

282
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,839
to, literally, the sun and moon
in the heavens.

283
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,560
They are setting them up
to be the inheritors

284
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,680
of a massive Eastern Empire

285
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,200
that Mark Antony and Cleopatra
are creating together.

286
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,839
We bow too. Yes.

287
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,880
-My lord.
-Aw.

288
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,280
[Colleen] Although Mark Antony
is preparing to invade Parthia,

289
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:36,000
these are months
where Mark Antony and Cleopatra

290
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,520
have a chance to rekindle their romance
and time together as a family.

291
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,400
And she becomes pregnant
with their third child.

292
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,960
Then life got in the way.

293
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,640
And life for them
is kind of, like, very serious.

294
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,880
Politics, strategy, wars,

295
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,000
trying to stop the Parthians
from, uh, invading his territory.

296
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,920
[soldiers yelling]

297
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,560
[soldiers continues yelling]

298
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,240
[Colleen] Despite Cleopatra's
financial support,

299
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,200
Mark Antony's Parthian invasion fails.

300
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,000
Much of this is because his former ally,
the King of Armenia, betrays him.

301
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,160
[soldiers yell]

302
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,160
[Islam] The Parthians
essentially defeat Mark Antony.

303
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,200
It's… it's a disastrous campaign
for Mark Antony.

304
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,360
He loses thousands of men.

305
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,160
Huge damage to his supplies.

306
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,000
And it's a perfect opportunity
for Octavian to make use of that.

307
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,760
But now he has this tangible evidence

308
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,760
that Mark Antony
is an inefficient commander.

309
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,480
[tense music]

310
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,720
[Colleen] At this point,
Cleopatra is back in Egypt.

311
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,000
She's not able to accompany
Mark Antony on the campaign

312
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,160
because she's giving birth
to their third child together…

313
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,040
-[crying]
-…Ptolemy.

314
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,560
[baby Ptolemy coos]

315
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,440
-[Charmion clears throat]
-What?

316
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,840
His campaign is not going
exactly according to plan.

317
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,760
And Octavian grows in confidence
with each of Antony's defeats.

318
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,120
And this last battle, Antony is…

319
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,240
It annoys me when you stop like that.

320
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,640
Pharaoh, right now, these are just rumors.

321
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,040
[Charmion] We should know more
from our trusted official channels soon.

322
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,000
How soon?

323
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,360
In a few weeks or--

324
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,600
That isn't good enough.

325
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,520
If we're hearing these rumors,

326
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,480
you can be sure Octavian
is hearing them as well.

327
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,480
[Charmion]
I will push for a faster response.

328
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,480
Hm.

329
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
[Charmion] In the interim,
how else would you like to proceed?

330
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,840
Find out where Antony is.

331
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,200
[tense music]

332
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,880
Cleopatra is concerned
about Mark Antony's losses,

333
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,240
and so she goes to visit him
in Antioch, Syria,

334
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,840
where he has retreated with his troops.

335
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,920
[ominous music]

336
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,080
[breathing heavily]

337
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,920
I said do not disturb me!

338
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,880
[yells]

339
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,960
[clatters]

340
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,600
Cleopatra.

341
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,480
[shaky breathing]

342
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,000
[exhales]

343
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,920
Nothing is working.

344
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,440
[breathing heavily]

345
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,120
That hairless little prick
is trumping my every move, all of them.

346
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,680
Then make new moves.

347
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,880
I have. A dozen times.

348
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,560
[inhales sharply]
It's as if he can read my mind.

349
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,560
[breathing heavily]

350
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,640
[Cleopatra] Enough.

351
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
No matter what I do, he is there.

352
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,320
How could he possibly read your mind?

353
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,400
Have you forgotten who you are?

354
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,120
{\an8}You are a better man
than Octavian will ever be.

355
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,680
You're stronger. You are a better soldier.

356
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,920
A better fighter.

357
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,760
And you can do it.

358
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,040
You have all of Egypt behind you.

359
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,960
You must go out there…

360
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,240
and act like you know what you are.

361
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What am I, Cleopatra? What am I?

362
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,000
You are a warrior.

363
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,040
You are my warrior.

364
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,560
[breathing heavily]

365
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,600
-Remember that.
-Yes.

366
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,920
-Okay?
-Yes.

367
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Okay.

368
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,000
Act like you know you've already won.

369
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,120
I already won.

370
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,880
I won.

371
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,600
And I love you.

372
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
[Islam] Cleopatra is in quite deep now
with Mark Antony.

373
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,280
Also, three kids involved.

374
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,640
And Mark Antony
has not just promised her support,

375
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,080
he's also promised
to take care of her kids

376
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,960
by giving them different territories
around the region.

377
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,920
[Islam] Mark Antony needs
her financial support.

378
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,320
Cleopatra is the one calling the shots.

379
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,680
To cement their relationship

380
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:47,440
and to… give it a divine validity,

381
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,840
Cleopatra marries Mark Antony.

382
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,080
[dramatic music]

383
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,720
[Colleen] Mark Antony's marriage
to Cleopatra is frowned upon in Rome.

384
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,080
He is already married to Octavia,
Octavian's sister.

385
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,000
In Egypt, it's a different story.

386
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,200
Kings often had multiple wives,

387
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,560
and Cleopatra is only married
to one person at this point in time.

388
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,000
Mark Antony.

389
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,080
[ominous music]

390
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,920
There's a big ceremony
that follows the marriage.

391
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,480
[Shelley] The Donations of Alexandria.

392
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,120
[crowd cheering]

393
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,360
[crowd whistling]

394
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,960
Your Isis greets you.

395
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,400
I pity enemies of Egypt.

396
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,920
I pity them more
when Egypt and Rome are united.

397
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,280
{\an8}These vipers underestimate
our divine union,

398
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,760
our wisdom,

399
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,720
our wealth,

400
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,800
our numbers,

401
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,080
the favor of our gods.

402
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,080
[crowd cheering]

403
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,760
Today, I stand here.

404
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,160
We stand here before you

405
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,280
with our divine future thriving before us.

406
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,920
[Sally-Ann]
The ceremony was extremely lavish.

407
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,800
We have the children dressed in costume,

408
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,320
we have Cleopatra dressed as Isis.

409
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,600
{\an8}And Mark Antony is essentially giving
the territories of Rome to the family.

410
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,200
And I promise you,

411
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,840
anyone who dares
to threaten our divine union

412
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,440
will regret the day they were born!

413
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,120
[crowd cheering]

414
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,040
At the Donation of Alexandria,

415
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,040
Mark Antony stands up and proclaims

416
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,560
that Caesarion
is, is Julius Caesar's heir.

417
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,600
[Shelley] Mark Antony formally hands over

418
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,480
all of the territories
that Cleopatra wanted.

419
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
[Colleen] The Donations of Alexandria

420
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,960
not only recreate the Ptolemaic Empire
at its greatest extent,

421
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,320
but it actually gives to Egypt

422
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,520
more territory than the Ptolemaic Empire
had ever controlled before.

423
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,760
[crowd cheering]

424
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,240
{\an8}In addition to giving away
the Roman territories, um,

425
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,760
Mark Antony now divorces, um,
Octavian's sister.

426
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,560
So, to add insult to injury,

427
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,520
uh, Mark Antony almost seems
as if he's cutting his ties with Rome.

428
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,920
You know that emoji
where the head explodes?

429
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,920
[shaky exhale]

430
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,080
[Shelley] That's Octavian when he hears
about the Donations of Alexandria.

431
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,160
"What is Mark Antony doing?

432
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,920
He's lost his mind.

433
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,760
He doesn't have the power to do this."

434
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,560
But at the same time, this gives Octavian
the perfect piece of propaganda.

435
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,320
Look at Mark Antony
behaving like an eastern king.

436
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,200
Look at Mark Antony not acting the part
of a true and proper Roman.

437
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:40,840
It's very easy then for Octavian
to cast the Donations of Alexandria

438
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,120
as an anti-Roman plot.

439
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,960
[dark tense music]

440
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,160
Mark Antony gives Octavian
the excuse for war.

441
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,600
But not against Mark Antony

442
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,760
because the Roman people
cannot endure another civil war.

443
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,360
[Shelley] Who's the scapegoat then?

444
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,680
Cleopatra.

445
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,720
"It's that witch."

446
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,520
"It's that witch."

447
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,560
And that's the beginning.

448
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,520
That's the beginning of the propaganda

449
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,840
against Cleopatra by Octavian.

450
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,840
And it's the beginning of the unraveling

451
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,120
of Mark Antony's reputation in Rome.

452
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,600
[ominous music]

453
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,560
-Mm.
-[laughs]

454
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,320
So…

455
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,600
[kisses]

456
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,960
…Octavian thinks you've bewitched me…

457
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,360
and put all of Rome in danger.

458
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,000
Hm.

459
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,840
Good.

460
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,040
Octavian is very angry and offended.

461
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,080
He's released
this vicious propaganda against Cleopatra.

462
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:16,520
So, even though Mark Antony was the one
who was unfaithful to his sister,

463
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,440
uh, Cleopatra is framed
as this great seductress,

464
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,720
and she's done these,
these things to trap him.

465
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,120
Little angry men often make big mistakes.

466
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,560
Octavian's mistake
is how much he underestimates us.

467
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,400
I think we should destroy him.

468
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,280
Hm.

469
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,200
[both breathe heavily]

470
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,520
At this particular point, um…

471
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,640
Octavian has declared war on Cleopatra.

472
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,080
{\an8}[suspenseful music]

473
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,240
[Colleen] In 31 BCE,

474
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:14,000
Cleopatra and Mark Antony go head-to-head
in all-out naval warfare with Octavian

475
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,640
in what is known as the Battle of Actium.

476
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,400
{\an8}[thrilling music]

477
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,720
{\an8}[Colleen] This is the climax
of a decade of rivalry.

00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,560
[tense music]

479
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,920
[soldiers grunting]

480
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,440
[Islam] She goes with many ships,
thousands of soldiers,

481
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,840
and they head towards Greece.

482
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,600
Cleopatra is very actively involved
in military life.

483
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,560
She wants to know the details,

484
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,520
she wants to know the tactics,
she wants to play a part in them.

485
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,040
And she… she's not a leader
who's in the palace.

486
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,440
She's very much on the front line.

487
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,520
[tense music]

488
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,920
[Islam] This is gonna be a showdown
that's gonna change

489
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
the history of Rome

490
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,240
and change the history of Egypt.

491
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,000
Cleopatra and Mark Antony
plan their naval strategy together.

492
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:26,840
She's supplying 200 of their 800 ships
and nearly all of the financing.

493
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,560
But this doesn't sit well
with all of Antony's generals,

494
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,080
some of whom don't want
to take orders from a woman.

495
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,840
[officer] With all due respect,

496
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,640
our allegiance is to the General, not a--

497
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,200
You will do well to remember
what I bring to the table.

498
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,440
-Oh, you dare to talk to me like--
-Enough!

499
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,400
-What she suggests goes against--
-She?

500
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,440
What I think you meant to say was,

501
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,360
"Thank you, Isis,

502
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,560
for providing us with the world's
most invincible naval fleet,

503
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,440
which we will deploy immediately,

504
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,480
with a force so mighty
that Octavian won't know what's hit him."

505
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,080
Am I correct?

506
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,720
Yes, General.

507
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,080
Thank you.

508
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,480
But I had it.

509
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,920
Mark Antony's Roman allies

510
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,320
become increasingly suspicious
of Cleopatra.

511
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,720
She represents an absolute monarchy.

512
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,520
She represents an eastern empire.

513
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,000
And she's a woman.

514
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,400
[Colleen] Mark Antony needs to be
a strong Roman general,

515
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:46,120
and his alliance with Cleopatra
threatens that identity

516
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,520
in the eyes of his Roman allies.

517
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,720
They are worried that he is acting less
like a Roman general

518
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,200
and more like an eastern king.

519
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,720
And because of that,

520
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:02,640
many of Mark Antony's commanders defect
and join Octavian's army.

521
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,400
[dramatic music]

522
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,640
{\an8}[Colleen] Once the battle begins,

523
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,400
{\an8}Mark Antony and Cleopatra
are on separate ships.

524
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,560
{\an8}Mark Antony leading the fleet at the front
and Cleopatra behind.

525
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,440
On the morning of September 2nd,

526
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:24,560
Mark Antony and Cleopatra attempt
to punch through the blockade

527
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,160
that Octavian has at the Bay of Actium.

528
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,200
Now, Mark Antony and Cleopatra combined
have fewer ships than Octavian.

529
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,760
The other major difference
between the two navies

530
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,880
is that Mark Antony's ships
are much larger.

531
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,680
They have more firepower,

532
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,080
but they also are way less maneuverable
than Octavian's lighter ships.

Cleopatra and Mark Antony both made

00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,960
a series of problematic battle decisions,

535
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,880
which is sort of surprising,

536
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,520
due to the fact
that they're both pretty savvy.

537
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,040
But they strung out their fleet, uh,

538
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,920
and allowed themselves to become trapped.

539
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,040
Octavian's lighter
and more maneuverable ships

540
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,240
managed to nearly surround the forces
of Mark Antony and Cleopatra.

541
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,920
[Sally-Ann] We're told by the Roman
sources that Cleopatra,

542
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,240
when she realized
that Mark Antony was being defeated,

543
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,880
turned her ships around
and decided to sail back to Alexandria.

544
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,120
[Cleopatra] Row!

545
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,960
Row! Faster! Harder!

546
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,000
[Cleopatra] Row!

547
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,560
[Sally-Ann]
She doesn't want to be captured.

548
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,000
There would have been no point
at all in her staying

549
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,240
in a battle
that they were effectively losing.

550
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,600
Her primary goal remains
the safety of her own kingdom.

551
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,400
The safety of Egypt.

552
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,440
[Colleen] She has no choice
but to try to make it back to Egypt

553
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,400
with as many of her ships as possible.

554
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,040
If she loses all of her navy
at the Battle of Actium,

555
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,760
Egypt will be defenseless.

556
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,360
Her ships' gone.

557
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,320
General, all of them.

558
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,639
She did what?

559
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,679
It's easy to see
from the Roman perspective

560
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,840
that Cleopatra taking her fleet

561
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,239
and leaving Actium is an act of treachery.

562
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,760
What did you do? Did you try to stop her?

563
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,840
-No.
-Did you try to stop her?

564
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,239
It might have actually been
the best decision even for Mark Antony,

565
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,400
at least keeping part of the Navy intact

566
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,440
in order to fight Octavian another day.

567
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,920
[Colleen] Mark Antony,
knowing the battle is all but lost,

568
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,600
flees and manages to catch up
to Cleopatra's fleet.

569
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:03,520
[thunder crackling]

570
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,200
What have you done?

571
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,240
-I couldn't risk my fleets.
-Ours!

572
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,800
And you should have asked me first.

573
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,600
I'm the General, not you.

574
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,360
Useless without my army.

575
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,920
How dare you?

576
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
How dare you?

577
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,920
Mark Antony is the commander
of the forces,

578
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,640
so he is the one
that's going to make the final decision.

579
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,440
But it is interesting
that when things go wrong,

580
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,960
Cleopatra is the one that gets the blame.

581
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,760
If you're going to give me an army,
let me govern it.

582
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,440
It was the right decision.

583
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,640
But you cut me out.

584
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,400
I did what I had to do.

585
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,800
But you did it without asking me.

586
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,920
I did what I had to do
to protect what is mine.

587
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,560
Ours, Cleopatra!

588
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,080
Not yours! Ours!

589
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,080
It's not something that your average Roman
would have done at the point of a battle.

590
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,760
Um, but actually, Cleopatra's thinking
about herself and her own power.

591
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,040
She's putting herself
and her family first.

592
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,080
Who do you think you are, Cleopatra?

593
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
The Pharoah! That is who!

594
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,080
Watch who you are speaking to.

595
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,680
[breathing shakily]

596
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,760
[Mark Antony]
They can hear all of this up there.

597
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,720
My men, my loyal men are laughing at me.

598
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,080
I'm not responsible for you
and how you feel.

599
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,960
I made a decision and I stand by it.

600
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,680
All I want…

601
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,680
is your trust.

602
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:45,560
The Battle of Actium is a disaster
for Mark Antony and Cleopatra.

603
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:51,320
They have lost their one opportunity
to meet and beat Octavian

604
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,280
outside of Egypt's borders.

605
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,680
Now they have no choice
but to fall back to Egypt

606
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,720
and simply defend their territory.

607
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,960
[Islam] Octavian, with this victory,

608
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,320
he's proven his power against Mark Antony,

609
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,480
against the Ptolemies.

610
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,520
This puts him in a great position,

611
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,560
and he, he already had a great position
because he was in Caesar's will.

612
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,360
But now he's proven it.

613
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,120
It's tangible. It's undeniable.

614
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,080
[Shelley] After the Battle of Actium,

615
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,160
Cleopatra takes control.

616
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,760
She writes to Octavian.

617
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,720
"If you allow me and Mark Antony to live,

618
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,240
we will go anywhere.

619
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,040
And you can have Egypt."

620
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,360
Mark, no one, can ever know. Please.

621
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,040
She doesn't quite try to appeal to him

622
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,000
in the, in the same way
that she did to Caesar

623
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,760
and to Antony in the past,

624
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,040
but she is pragmatic.

625
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,880
At this stage, she probably knows
that she will be exiled,

626
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,680
but she still wants her children
to have rule at least over Egypt.

627
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,920
She also asks Octavian for Antony to live.

628
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,440
[Colleen] Cleopatra needs to cut a deal
with Octavian just to survive.

629
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,360
Her fate, that of her family
and her kingdom,

630
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,160
are entirely in Octavian's hands.

631
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,120
[birds squawking]

632
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,960
My lord, Octavian, thanks Pharoah
for your message

633
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,800
and instructs me, as his ambassador,
to inform you…

634
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,720
he's willing to grant your request.

635
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,680
[whispers]
Okay.

636
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,120
[Thyrsus] On one condition.

637
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,800
A simple request.

638
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,920
Kill Antony.

639
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,440
His life for yours.

640
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,760
And your children's, of course.

641
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
[tense music]

642
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,400
{\an8}[closing theme music]
