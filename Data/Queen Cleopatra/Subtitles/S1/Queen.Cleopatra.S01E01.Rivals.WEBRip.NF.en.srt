And Arsinoe similarly
has a eunuch who has raised her,

125
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,720
so a lot of the decisions
that are made by Cleopatra's siblings

126
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,840
are not necessarily their own.

127

You may love your sibling,

128

but you also understand that your sibling
will stab you in the back.

And so, I think that that is kind of
the relationship she had with Arsinoe.

alongside her brother, Ptolemy XIII.

179
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,560
[Debora] You could eliminate
the competition through murder

180
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,880
or you could marry.

181
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,120
That doesn't mean that they didn't murder,

182
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,160
but they chose to marry first.

183
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,280
Ready, little brother?

184
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,880
Children of Egypt,

185
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,680
we are here at this time
to witness Thea Philopator Cleopatra

186
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,040
and Ptolemy Theos Philopator.

187
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,800
[Shelley] There has to be
a male and female pharaoh

188
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,240
because Isis and Osiris
were the major gods in Egyptian religion,

189
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,080
and since the male and female pharaohs
are also gods,

190
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,600
they have to reflect Isis and Osiris.

191
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,880
Gods marry their brothers
and their sisters.

192
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,480
That's what gods do.

193
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,360
And so, this was considered
completely proper behavior.

194
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,280
And certainly for a Ptolemaic ruler

195
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,280
who wanted to support
traditional religion,

196
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,240
that was absolutely the way.

197
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,800
I present to you…

198
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,720
Osiris and Isis reborn.

199
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,760
[Colleen] Because her brother-husband
Ptolemy was only a child,

200
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,720
Cleopatra had a definite advantage
in terms of her strategic position.

201
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,440
But Ptolemy has very powerful advisors
at court.

202
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,240
[Shelley] His main advisor is Pothinus.

203
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,840
[crowd cheering]

204
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,640
Pothinus wants to be the real power.

205
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,520
Cleopatra stands in the way.

206
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,640
[crowd applauding]

207
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,600
[Shelley] Once Cleopatra succeeds
to the throne,

208
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,200
one of her first acts
is to undertake a pilgrimage

209
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,880
to cement her relationship
with the Egyptian people.

210
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,000
[indistinct chatter]

211
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,240
[chuckles softly]

212
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,080
[Arsinoe] Stinks.

213
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,800
Will you behave yourself, please?

214
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,240
These are our people. They're watching.

215
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,160
Sorry.

216
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,080
Hi.

217
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,520
[indistinct chatter]

218
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,520
[Debora] I think that her wanting
to learn more about the Egyptian people

219
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,440
was a way to try to integrate herself
more into the country.

220
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,440
[lively music playing]

221
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,600
[Jacquelyn] There were three primary
populations in Egypt as a whole.

222
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,920
Of course, we have native Egyptians.

223
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,760
We have the Greek peoples,
who came in with the Ptolemies,

224
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,600
and then we also have
a very sizable Jewish population.

225
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,080
All three of these populations
did not like each other,

226
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,280
but they were all unified
in the fact that they didn't like Rome.

227
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,880
[Shelley] For the most part,

228
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,840
the Ptolemies separated themselves
from the indigenous Egyptian people.

229
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,840
Come on, that's beautiful.
Look at the colors.

230
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,240
We have those colors at home.

231
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,480
[Shelley] Cleopatra's affinity
for the Egyptian people

232
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,400
was looked at askance
by people like Pothinus,

233
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,200
who thought that this was just
a silly gesture by a silly girl.

234
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,960
But the indigenous people
saw this as a mark of leadership.

235
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,680
[celebratory music playing]

236
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,920
[Colleen] The very first recorded event
of Cleopatra's reign

237
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,680
is her celebration of the installation
of the new Buchis bull.

238
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,600
[bull whines]

239
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,960
The earthly embodiment of the god Montu,

240
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,080
a very ancient god in Egypt.

241
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,000
And this is really remarkable,

242
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,520
for Cleopatra
to travel deep into upper Egypt

243
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,000
to celebrate this ritual,

244
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,760
signifies that she wants to be
an Egyptian queen,

245
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,000
not just a Ptolemaic queen.

246
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,760
[Shelley] Cleopatra feels very close
to the Egyptian people.

247
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,560
Cleopatra learned the Egyptian language.

248
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,040
She practiced the Egyptian religion.

249
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,320
[Shelley] She wants to be remembered
as Egyptian.

250
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,160
We don't know her exact racial heritage.

251
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,200
We don't know who Cleopatra's mother was.

252
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,840
There's been a lot of research
to prove that her mother was Egyptian,

253
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,080
but we can't know for sure.

254
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,080
[Sally-Ann] It's also uncertain
who Cleopatra's grandmother was.

255
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,040
Cleopatra's father was given a nickname,
which was illegitimate,

256
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,400
so people recognized that his mother

257
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,920
had probably been somebody
who was at the royal court.

258
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,600
It's possible that she was an Egyptian.

259
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,120
Ancient Egyptians would've had
a variety of different complexions,

260
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,160
um, as we find
in other African cultures today.

261
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,640
Skin color ranged
from black to pale brown,

262
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,320
much like the people of South Sudan

263
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,960
to modern-day Egypt.

264
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,560
Given that Cleopatra
represents herself as an Egyptian,

265
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:38,160
it seems very strange that we insist
on depicting her as a wholly European.

266
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,520
[Debora] If you look at her depictions,
she looks different

267
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,400
depending on who it is
that's depicting her.

268
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,800
So her representations change,

269
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,440
her perceptions change.

270
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
So she's almost like this chameleon.

271
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,800
The appeal of Cleopatra
is that we imagine her,

272
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,880
that everyone
can imagine her in their own way.

273
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,200
I imagine her to have curly hair like me

274
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,640
and a similar skin color.

275
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,280
[celebratory music playing]

276
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,560
[tense music]

277
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,160
[Debora] Some of the challenges
that Cleopatra faces

278
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,520
where she's taking power

279
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,440
after her father's death

280
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,119
is that he left this huge debt.

281
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,599
{\an8}[Debora] Egypt was a client state
of, of Rome at the time.

282
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:32,000
{\an8}And the Ptolemies were fighting
desperately to maintain independence.

283
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,320
{\an8}[Shelley] Rome is the emerging power.

284
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,440
{\an8}Rome understands

285
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,200
that Egypt is the breadbasket
of the Mediterranean.

286
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,920
But Egypt
is in a very precarious situation.

287
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,360
[Shelley] The Nile,
which had to flood every year

288
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,400
in order to produce crops,

289
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,400
has not flooded
at the same level for several years.

290
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,560
Now, this isn't Cleopatra's fault.

291
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,320
Natural occurrences never are.

292
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,960
[Shelley] But it did put Cleopatra
in a little bit of a tricky situation.

293
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,840
[bird squawking]

294
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
[brays]

295
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,560
I should've come sooner.

296
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,680
You're here now.

297
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,680
Open the royal grain stores.

298
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,640
Let's get these people fed.

299
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,240
And we should build a temple.

300
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,240
A place for hope.

301
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,800
They'll remember this.

302
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,800
So will I.

303
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,320
I'm glad I came.

304
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,320
[horses braying]

305
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,480
[tense music]

306
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,920
So there's a civil war going on in Rome.

307
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,360
[civilians screaming]

308
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,000
Once again, it's about power.

309
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,920
Um…

310
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,080
It's two men.

311
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,280
Julius Caesar, representing "the people,"

312
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,000
and Pompey the Great,

313
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,440
representing the Optimates or upper class.

314
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,080
[Shelley] Cleopatra's father,
Ptolemy XII, had borrowed heavily,

315
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,440
mainly from Pompey.

316
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,960
Egypt's relationship to Rome is basically…

317
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,280
that of a poor cousin.

318
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,480
[Shelley] This is a very tricky time
for Cleopatra.

319
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,760
She knows that her brother, Ptolemy XIII,

320
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,320
is being hoodwinked by Pothinus.

321
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,400
She's for diplomacy.

322
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,640
She is for working with Pompey,

323
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,600
to at least find out what he wants.

324
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,240
But Pothinus and Ptolemy XIII
have other plans.

325
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,960
Why did you reject Pompey's request?

326
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,240
He's losing the war. Right?

327
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,400
So abandoning our allies
in their time of need is a new policy?

328
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,280
After everything he did
for Father in exile,

329
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,320
where is your honor?

330
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,280
With all due respect,
we sent him soldiers when he first asked,

331
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,640
which clearly didn't help.

332
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,040
His Highness
is making a prudent calculation.

333
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,800
It would be unwise
to send good Egyptian soldiers

334
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,440
into a bad Roman war.

335
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,880
Father worked hard to ensure that Egypt
became the hand that feeds Rome,

336
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,240
not just a mere colony.

337
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,280
This prudent calculation you're making--

338
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,760
Feeding Rome has left Egyptians
with nothing to eat.

339
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,880
Which brings us to the matter
of the storehouses left open down south.

340
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,800
What is there to eat in Alexandria?

341
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,640
It would be dangerous
to get mixed up in Roman politics.

342
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,840
We are already mixed up
in Rome's politics, Pothinus.

343
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,600
[Sally-Ann]
The people who were advising Ptolemy XIII

344
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,600
were really in control at this point.

345
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,920
And, and their main aim
was to kill Cleopatra.

346
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,400
[tense music]

347
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,920
[Shelley] Pothinus is able to get…

348
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,640
a faction of the Alexandrians on his side.

349
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,920
And they stage a palace coup.

350
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,840
This forces Cleopatra and Arsinoe to flee.

351
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,280
[Shelley] She knows she has the support

352
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,280
of the people
living in Memphis and Thebes.

353
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,480
All of these people
were loyal to her father.

354
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,200
[Shelley]
And she flees first to Upper Egypt.

355
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,640
I'm going back to fight for my throne.

356
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,040
[chuckles]

357
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,240
With whose army?

358
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,640
How many soldiers
can we amass from southern Egypt?

359
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,840
Not enough.

360
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,480
And ones you can trust, even less.

361
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,760
[Cleopatra chuckles]

362
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,080
Achillas will be commanding
your brother's army.

363
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,400
You'll need men
who will not cower to his past glories.

364
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,640
{\an8}I didn't think Pothinus
would move that quickly.

365
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,240
You underestimated him.

366
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,200
But it's hard to see a viper
in the tall grass

367
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,680
unless you're a bird.

368
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,880
{\an8}I'll go east to Syria.

369
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,400
{\an8}My father still has friends there.

370
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,760
Friends that know you to be his true heir.

371
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,880
[chuckles]

372
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,640
{\an8}[Islam] Cleopatra is raised in Alexandria.

373
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,120
{\an8}It's part of her.

374
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,760
{\an8}So being exiled was probably
quite a hurtful experience for her.

375
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,440
And she would've been looking
to return as swiftly as possible.

376
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,040
[Sally-Ann] Certainly, Cleopatra
isn't the kind of person who gives up.

377
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,000
She's very much a fighter.

378
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,000
[Shelley] Cleopatra is in Syria
for two years.

379
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,120
In that time, she's able
to put together her own army.

380
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,600
[Shelley] As long as she's alive,

381
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,280
this seems the most strategic thing to do.

382
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,240
She has the support
of the Egyptian people.

383
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,520
She has the support
of the people in Syria.

384
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,960
[Cleopatra grunts]

385
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,640
-[Syrian soldier grunts]
-[swords clink]

386
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,560
[Cleopatra yelling]

387
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,960
She's probably feeling defiant.

388
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,440
[both grunting]

389
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,040
[Colleen] Ever since Cleopatra
is forced to flee Egypt,

390
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
we can imagine her scheming

391
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
about how to get back on the throne.

392
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,920
[Colleen] And she is given
the perfect opportunity.

393
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,760
In the Roman civil war,

394
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,840
there's been a major battle
at Pharsalus in Greece.

395
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,200
[Shelley] Julius Caesar
has defeated Pompey,

396
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,880
his former son-in-law.

397
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,280
Pompey flees to Egypt to ask for help.

398
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,000
And Julius Caesar follows not long after.

399
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,680
[Colleen] So Cleopatra returns to Egypt.

400
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,080
If we target these northern defenses,

401
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,400
do we leave ourselves vulnerable
at our eastern points?

402
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,320
Not if we station regiments here and here.

403
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,280
Okay.

404
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,920
That idiot Pompey
is headed to Ptolemy's war camp.

405
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,160
If Caesar follows,

406
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,080
he'll be sure to bring Rome's civil war
straight to our shores.

407
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,960
That would be political suicide.

408
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,680
Well, what if he wants to avenge
our earlier support of Pompey?

409
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,680
[Arsinoe] So?

410
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,680
Then we kill Pompey.

411
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,080
We're not killing Pompey.

412
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,560
It's the easiest way
to prove our allegiance to Caesar.

413
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,640
We're not killing Caesar's son-in-law.

414
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,880
[Ammonios] Your Highness.

415
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,000
[Cleopatra] We need to rebuild this part.

416
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,520
[Colleen] The stakes are incredibly high.

417
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,560
If Cleopatra does not gain
the favor of Julius Caesar,

418
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,960
she might be exiled from Egypt forever,

419
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,520
and permanently lose her throne.

420
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,800
[tense music]

421
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,600
Pompey lands.

422
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,040
And he is stabbed in the back.

423
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,880
[Shelley] Pothinus has orchestrated this…

424
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,680
and Pothinus also arranges
to have Pompey decapitated.

425
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,880
Pothinus has persuaded Ptolemy XIII

426
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:26,000
that this will put them
in the good graces of Julius Caesar.

427
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,960
But they misunderstood
the Roman sense of honor.

428
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,840
You tell me…

429
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,360
who did this?

430
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,480
Huh?

431
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,280
[Caesar breathes heavily]

432
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,840
[Shelley] Pothinus and Ptolemy XIII
are not prepared

433
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,800
for Julius Caesar's reaction.

434
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,880
He is outraged that they would kill
someone who had been a statesman,

435
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,560
someone who had been a co-leader
of the Roman Republic,

436
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,920
and who was his former son-in-law.

437
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,040
[birds chirping]

438
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,160
Julius Caesar's arrival in Alexandria

439
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,080
provides Cleopatra
with the perfect opportunity

440
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,640
for a new stratagem.

441
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
How do we play this?

442
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,080
Unless you can resuscitate the dead,
I'm at a loss.

443
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
I need an audience with him.

444
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,240
That's a very dangerous idea.

445
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,120
He's a grieving general,
weary from battle,

446
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,400
in need of an easy victory.

447
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,600
I'm going to give him one.

448
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,040
I'll figure something out.

449
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,400
Thank you.

450
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,200
[suspenseful music]

451
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,520
[Islam] Caesar isn't just anybody.

452
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,800
Caesar's the biggest celebrity
in the world.

453
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,400
So when he arrives, it's big news.

454
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,120
{\an8}He makes himself at home
in the royal palace in Alexandria,

455
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,880
so we've immediately got
all of the siblings really worried

456
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,200
that Caesar has arrived
and made himself at home

457
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,440
in their palace, in their city.

458
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,520
It's Cleopatra
who deals with it by saying,

459
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,680
"I'll get back into my own palace.

460
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,640
Maybe I can make an alliance with him."

461
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,800
[knocking]

462
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,840
Enter.

463
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,160
[approaching footsteps]

464
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,680
What is this?

465
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,480
[Cleopatra] I apologize for the ruse,

466
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,440
but it was the only way
to get an audience with you.

467
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,760
[Jacquelyn]
Julius Caesar's interaction with Cleopatra

468
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,920
is one of the more famous historic events
that's ever been recorded.

469
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,120
But the exciting story

470
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,840
of her being smuggled
in a carpet, uh, is very unlikely.

471
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,840
Even if Cleopatra was smuggled in,

472
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,320
it would've been more likely
perhaps in a bag.

473
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:12,840
The source for the story
is a Greek historian, Plutarch,

474
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,760
who lived 150 years after Cleopatra died.

475
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,640
He doesn't know.

476
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,840
There was a… a propaganda attempt

477
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,000
to sway the Roman public
away from Cleopatra.

478
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,200
So she now is this temptress, uh,

479
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,200
as opposed to being this beautiful woman
that everybody was attracted to.

480
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,840
There has to be something
mystical about her.

481
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,960
There has to be something seductive,

482
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,120
and seductive in a kind of evil way.

483
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,960
Leave us.

484
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,000
Well, you have your audience.

485
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
On behalf of my late father and I,

486
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,720
the great Ptolemy Auletes…

487
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,280
please accept my deepest, deepest sympathy

488
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,480
for the sad passing of the great Pompey.

489
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,960
He and my father were dear friends…

490
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,400
which made him like a father to me.

491
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,840
He showed us great kindness
while we were in exile in Rome.

492
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,680
And you repaid that kindness…

493
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,120
with his death.

494
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,240
If I had been on Egypt's throne,
he would still be alive today.

495
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,280
I risked your wrath for him.

496
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,040
We served Rome with our own soldiers.

497
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,840
It was not a move against you
or ill towards Rome,

498
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,440
but a sign of my love and respect

499
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,720
for a man who was dear to me
like my father.

500
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,000
I had planned
to bring him back home to Rome.

501
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,120
Pardon him…

502
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,760
in honor of his late wife.

503
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,240
My daughter.

504
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,560
[Cleopatra] You'll remember…

505
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,440
we've met before.

506
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,960
I do not recall.

507
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,960
I was only a little girl then.

508
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,840
Not the ruler that stands before you now.

509
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,280
[laughs]

510
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,520
Last I heard,
you'd been ousted from your throne.

511
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,360
Maybe.

512
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,240
But my father's will
names me co-ruler of Egypt.

513
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,760
Then tell me this…

514
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,680
Cleopatra…

515
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,320
how do you hope to rule
when the Alexandrians oppose you?

516
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,320
The Senate opposed you.

517
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,680
And yet, here we are.

518
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,880
[smirks]

519
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,960
[Colleen] Julius Caesar,
used to running the affairs of Rome,

520
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,760
meets Cleopatra,

521
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,880
and it's… it's truly a meeting
of, of two great minds.

522
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,160
[Islam] Cleopatra is this really
confident woman with great charisma.

523
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,120
She was obviously a diplomat,

524
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,360
and actually,
she's not bowing down to him.

525
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,160
She's kind of shifting the power dynamic.

526
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:31,240
[Sally-Ann] Julius Caesar is presented
with this young woman, who is strong.

527
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,960
She was intelligent
and she was an African woman

528
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,000
who saw herself not only as a ruler
but as a goddess as well.

529
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,520
So she would've been very different

530
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,520
to any other woman
that Julius Caesar would've met in Rome.

531
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,200
[Caesar]
And that is my understanding of it.

532
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,080
[laughs]
No.

533
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,880
[chuckles]
Yes.

534
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,800
If you want to understand that text,

535
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,920
you need to read it
in the original language.

536
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,680
I'm afraid I don't have the gift
of languages that you do.

537
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,040
[laughs]

538
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,720
Mm.

539
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,840
Mm.

540
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
[chuckles]

541
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,680
[Colleen] Unlike Roman women,

542
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,960
who, traditionally,
are expected to stay home

543
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,480
and not take part in political affairs,

544
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,680
Cleopatra was a world leader.

545
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,080
[Colleen] And Julius Caesar can speak
to her of his military campaigns,

546
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,160
of literature, of philosophy
on almost equal terms.

547
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,280
[slow sensual music]

548
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,199
We can imagine that it was true love,

549
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,320
that it really was a meeting
of both mind and heart.

550
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,639
On the other hand,
much of the relationship

551
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,719
might've been tempered by strategy.

552
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,480
Julius Caesar had something to gain
by assisting Cleopatra,

553
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,000
and Cleopatra certainly
had much more to gain

554
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,480
by allying herself with Julius Caesar.

555
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,199
[suspenseful music]

556
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,240
[Shelley]
Cleopatra wants Ptolemy XIII gone.

557
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,000
She wants Pothinus gone,

558
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:20,160
and she wants Arsinoe
kept under a very close watch.

559
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,400
But mostly, she wants to be
on the throne by herself.

560
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,400
[Shelley] Pothinus fears Cleopatra.

561
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,320
He fears her ability
to make people loyal to her.

562
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,320
And that includes Julius Caesar
and the Romans.

563
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,560
Caesar seems to have wanted
to come and calm the situation down

564
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,320
and try and, and put
the appropriate rulers on the throne.

565
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,360
[crowd shouting]

566
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,640
I don't really think
that Julius Caesar was ready

567
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,680
for, for what met him
when he got to Alexandria.

568
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,720
It's possible that the family
was more dysfunctional

569
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
than he could ever have possibly imagined.

570
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,880
Noble citizens of Egypt…

571
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,880
I know I speak for all
when I say it is time for peace.

572
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,680
I am the harbinger of that peace.

573
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,720
So in accordance
with the last will and testament

574
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,240
of Ptolemy Neos Dionysus…

575
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,360
Rome acknowledges his daughter,

576
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,560
Cleopatra Thea Philopator…

577
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,400
and his eldest son,

578
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,960
Ptolemy Theos Philopator…

579
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,680
as co-rulers of Egypt.

580
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,800
[Shelley] Caesar is a master diplomat.

581
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,000
He decides that he is going to…

582
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,600
follow the instructions
of Ptolemy XII's rule.

583
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,480
He restores Cleopatra

584
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,960
to the throne
as co-pharaoh with Ptolemy XIII.

585
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:14,000
He gives some dominions to Arsinoe.

586
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,400
In addition to this…

587
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,400
and as a sign
of our unending love for you,

588
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,560
Rome also bestows

589
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,160
on his youngest daughter, Arsinoe,

590
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,400
and youngest son, Ptolemy XIV,

591
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,320
the region of Cyprus.

592
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,520
Be grateful.

593
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,200
[Caesar] Rome loves you.

594
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,200
Caesar also reduces the debt

595
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,000
that Egypt owes Rome.

596
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,640
[Sally-Ann] We're not quite sure
how Cleopatra managed to do this,

597
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,880
but actually, I would suggest
that she was strategically

598
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,120
aligning herself with men
who have considerable amount of power.

599
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,920
He seems too familiar.

600
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,200
[laughs]

601
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,600
-Happy?
-Very.

602
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,640
Are you bedding my wife?

603
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,400
[Ptolemy XIII breathes angrily]

604
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,440
And there I was thinking
the Senate had all the theatrics.

605
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,440
-[laughing]
-[chuckles softly]

606
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,200
[sighs]
You're laughing at me.

607
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,240
Disrespecting me in my own home.

608
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,200
Calm down.

609
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,760
Don't tell me to calm down!

610
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,080
This is my home! Mine!

611
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,720
And I call upon the people of Egypt
to riot against you and Rome!

612
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,600
Well?

613
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,160
[Caesar laughing]

614
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,120
[tense music]

615
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,080
Caesar.

616
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,960
[Colleen] Unfortunately for Julius Caesar,
his plans come to naught.

617
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,840
In fact, a civil war breaks out.

618
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,800
The so-called Alexandrian War.

619
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,120
[Colleen] On one side,
you have Julius Caesar and Cleopatra.

620
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,120
On the other, the eunuch Pothinus,

621
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,600
Ptolemy XIII, and her sister, Arsinoe.

622
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,320
[Jacquelyn] The city of Alexandria,

623
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,160
during this four-month period
of these terrible wars,

624
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,680
would've been very frightening.

625
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,880
We have not only
professional soldiers engaging,

626
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,680
but we also have guerrilla warfare.

627
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,880
We have rioting.

628
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,720
We have Romans
burning big chunks of the city.

629
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,400
This would have been catastrophic
and terrifying for pretty much everyone.

630
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,280
[Ammonios] We've lost count of the dead
on the streets of Memphis and Alexandria.

631
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,560
The riots have spread south to Thebes.

632
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,800
And the storehouses,
which were left unguarded,

633
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,720
have been emptied.

634
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,640
If we do not increase taxation
in Alexandria,

635
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,600
we'll not be able to sustain this siege
and Egypt will collapse.

636
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,480
[Colleen] One of the greatest losses

637
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,920
is the burning
of the library of Alexandria.

638
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,440
[Sally-Ann] This library
had taken 300 years to build up.

639
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,880
So we lost this huge resource effectively

640
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,560
because of sibling rivalry.

641
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,880
[Colleen] During the course
of this conflict,

642
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,880
Cleopatra's sister Arsinoe

643
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,680
marshals her own forces.

644
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,720
Arsinoe?

645
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,240
She's taken control of the Egyptian army.

646
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,200
Well, that's impossible. Someone's lying.

647
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,920
She ordered the death of Achillas
and declared herself ruler.

648
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,640
She has the support of the Alexandrians.

649
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,680
[groans]

650
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,960
Come. Come.

651
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,960
[Cleopatra groans]

652
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,720
[Cleopatra retching]

653
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,400
[Cleopatra groans]

654
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,480
-[Charmion] Oh.
-[retches]

655
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,560
[Cleopatra grunts]

656
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,400
[breathing heavily]

657
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,040
Could I be…

658
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,040
I'll bring some water.

659
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,000
[panting]

660
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,200
[Cleopatra gasps]

661
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,080
The timing couldn't be more perfect.

662
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,640
[Jacquelyn] Cleopatra is aware
that having a child with Julius Caesar

663
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,160
is an ace in the game of poker
that she's trying to play with Rome.

664
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,920
Cleopatra carries within her womb

665
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,520
the potential to unite Egypt and Rome.

666
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,960
[Islam] It's an unimaginably
powerful child.

667
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,320
These are two
of the greatest civilizations,

668
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,840
two of the greatest cities in the world

669
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,040
embodied in a single human being.

670
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,400
And that is momentous.

671
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,240
[Shelley] Meanwhile,
the Alexandrian war was a disaster

672
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,320
for Ptolemy XIII and Arsinoe.

673
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,360
When Arsinoe joins forces
against Julius Caesar…

674
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,640
and loses,

675
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,640
she's captured
and imprisoned in the palace.

676
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:10,800
Ptolemy was dressed in gold armor
and is aboard a ship.

677
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,760
[Shelley] He either falls overboard
or he's pushed,

678
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,360
and the weight of the armor
causes him to drown.

679
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,560
[Ammonios] We have searched
the breadth of the Nile.

680
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,880
We have to accept
that he's been swept out to sea.

681
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,360
I don't know.

682
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,680
Couldn't he have been rescued
by a loyalist?

683
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,240
No.

684
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,880
Your Highness, you have to stop this.

685
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,240
He's no longer a threat.

686
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,200
[pensive music]

687
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,120
[Shelley] Cleopatra has won.

688
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,000
And she knows that…

689
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,960
as long as she's alive,

690
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,360
she is the pharaoh.

691
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,320
Did you lose your way?

692
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,000
No.

693
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,160
You?

694
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,560
What do you want?

695
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,440
To understand why.

696
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,600
Why not?

697
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,440
[Arsinoe] You didn't think…

698
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,280
I deserved to rule, did you?

699
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,640
{\an8}Little Arsinoe,
easily dismissed by everyone.

700
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,040
{\an8}I deserve it just as much as you,
if not more.

701
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,320
Rome gave you Cyprus--

702
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,480
But I wanted Egypt!

703
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,400
Not some small province
floating out at sea.

704
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,720
I want my birthright.

705
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,840
[Arsinoe] Your Caesar's taking me to Rome.

706
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,240
To put you to death.

707
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,120
I always thought it was better to die,

708
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,680
knowing you were meeting death

709
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,160
than to wake up
in the afterlife surprised.

710
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,680
[scoffs]

711
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,400
-You betrayed me.
-You need a thicker skin!

712
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,080
Stop interrupting me.

713
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,600
I'm sorry.

714
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,160
I didn't realize
you were the one short on time.

715
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,680
If I had the chance…

716
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,520
I'd do it again.

717
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,720
You won't have the chance.

718
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,760
As Julius Caesar departs for Rome,

719
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,600
Cleopatra is nearly seven months pregnant.

720
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,080
She is the undisputed queen of Egypt.

721
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,360
[Colleen] Unfortunately for Cleopatra,

722
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,440
she has another brother named Ptolemy.

723
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,280
And when Julius Caesar leaves for Rome,

724
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,200
she is indeed married
to another younger brother,

725
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,120
with whom she is expected
to share the throne of Egypt.

726
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,360
I've left you a big stick
in case he steps out of line.

727
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,280
Hm.

728
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,400
Come back and see your son soon.

729
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,080
This is goodbye, sister.

730
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,760
[gasps]

731
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,880
Maybe.

732
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,440
There's a lot of distance
from here to Rome.

733
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,840
[Shelley] Cleopatra has exacted a promise
from Julius Caesar

734
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,880
that he will execute Arsinoe
as a traitor to Rome.

735
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,200
That doesn't happen.

736
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,360
