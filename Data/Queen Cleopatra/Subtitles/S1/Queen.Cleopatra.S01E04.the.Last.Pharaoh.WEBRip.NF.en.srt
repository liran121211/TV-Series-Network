00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,240
-[indistinct chatter]
-[celebratory music playing]

179
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,720
[Jacquelyn] The reason that Cleopatra
throws the banquet

180
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,600
is part of the religious ideology
of this area.

181
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,320
Mark Antony, as the manifestation
of the god Dionysus,

182
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,200
is the god of revelry

183
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,920
and this banquet would have served
to support and reinvigorate

184
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
that religious message of him
as a legitimate eastern monarch.

185
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,280
[indistinct chatter]

186
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,000
[indistinct chatter]

187
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,640
[Islam] It's directly challenging Rome.

188
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,800
It's saying, "We are in power."

189
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,880
[Islam] It's a declaration
that she doesn't care what Rome thinks.

190
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,840
It's a dangerous call for war.

191
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,560
[whispering]

192
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,000
[Jacquelyn] As Octavian's army
approaches Alexandria,

193
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,720
Antony and Cleopatra's forces
at this point,

194
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,840
are disorganized, they're demoralized.

195
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,120
[indistinct chatter]

196
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,400
The Commander of Pelusium has surrendered.

197
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,840
And defected to Octavian.

198
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,160
[Shelley] Octavian is receiving defections
from the Egyptian side

199
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,960
and from other allies

200
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,880
that used to be with Egypt

201
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,800
and they're now going over to Rome.

202
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,200
That two-faced Pelusium commander
will never see his wife or daughter again.

203
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,240
Not in this lifetime.

204
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,120
It will take more than that
to stop Octavian now.

205
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,480
I know.

206
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,200
It will take the help of the gods.

207
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,800
Lucky for you, you have one right here.

208
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,120
[soft music]

209
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,680
Octavian is no match for us.

210
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,200
[thrilling music]

211
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
[Cleopatra] Friends.

212
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,640
Even in the best of times,

213
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,480
there are traitors amongst us.

214
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,080
We know that in our own land,

215
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,960
some have betrayed Egypt,

216
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,920
opening their gates to Octavian's forces.

217
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,720
No one betrays Egypt
and gets away with it.

218
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,240
Your enemies are our enemies.

219
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,040
To Mark Antony.

220
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,680
[cheers, applause]

221
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,960
[Sally-Ann] The Egyptian people
must have been extremely nervous

222
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,720
about the Roman Army marching upon them.

223
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,880
Because Rome up until this point,

224
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,720
they've been seen as a support

225
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,760
and now they've essentially
become an enemy.

226
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,000
[indistinct chatter]

227
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,320
[Islam] <i>It's too late for Cleopatra
to get on Octavian's side.</i>

228
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,160
<i>She's in quite deep now with Mark Antony.</i>

229
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,480
Are you asleep?

230
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,960
No.

231
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,160
[Sally-Ann] So, she really does have
everything to lose at this point.

232
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,680
It's not only her own life
and her position,

233
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,240
but it's her country.

234
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,200
-[Mark Antony] How long?
-We have time.

235
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,120
-And eyes?
-Our scouts have eyes on them.

236
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,040
Tell the cavalry we leave now.

237
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,440
[Cleopatra] Thank you, Maelius.

238
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,280
[tense music]

239
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,280
[inhales]

240
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,200
[Colleen] The one advantage
that Cleopatra has

241
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,280
is that she's defending
her home territory.

242
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,720
And she knows
from prior experience with Julius Caesar,

243
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,040
that the Egyptians are no lovers of Rome.

244
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,760
Egypt does not want to be
under Roman control or Roman occupation.

245
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,360
[Jacquelyn] Mark Antony
is an accomplished military mind.

246
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,640
That is a very serious
home-field advantage for them.

247
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,360
{\an8}He and Octavian's forces
meet right outside of Alexandria.

248
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,440
-[soldiers yelling]
-Come on!

249
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,080
[Shelley] Mark Antony is a soldier.

250
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,120
He knows what goes into winning a battle.

251
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,560
[Shelley] He enjoys going into battle.

252
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,280
He enjoys fighting alongside of his men.

253
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,160
Antony and Cleopatra's forces have had
some time to rest and recuperate.

254
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,520
[Jacquelyn] Whereas, Octavian's forces
have been on the active march

255
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,840
and so, uh, Antony's forces
are at least fresh.

256
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,680
[tense music]

257
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,040
[Cleopatra] What's going on?

258
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,160
Is there water and provisions
for the wounded?

259
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,360
Yes, yes, it's done.

260
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,720
-And the armory, has it been checked?
-[Iras] As we speak.

261
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,640
[Colleen] Based on previous experience,

262
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,040
Cleopatra knows the vulnerability

263
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,560
of Alexandria's water sources.

264
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,840
[Colleen] She knows
that they can be poisoned.

265
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,040
I want two guards stationed at every well
and every water supply.

266
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,720
[soldiers yelling]

267
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,240
The other disadvantage
that Mark Antony and Cleopatra face

268
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,440
is simply the lack of supplies and force.

269
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,920
They do not have the troops,
and they no longer have the supply lines.

270
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,920
[Shelley] Cleopatra is a lover,
not a fighter.

271
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,440
She understands
that war can go either way,

272
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,840
she feels that Mark Antony
doesn't really understand

273
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,120
the lay of the land in Alexandria.

274
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,640
[grunts]

275
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,440
[Shelley] Maybe he has bit off

276
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,880
-more than he can chew here.
-[Mark Antony] <i>Come on</i>!

277
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,560
She's nervous.

278
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,640
[grunts]

279
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,079
[horse neighs]

280
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,520
[swords clinking]

281
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,079
[somber music]

282
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,160
We have won the battle, but…

283
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,880
[Cleopatra] But what?

284
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,400
They have more troops, Cleopatra.

285
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,560
I know.

286
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,880
We are not done yet.

287
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,320
Are we?

288
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,480
No.

289
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,520
We are not done yet.

290
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,560
Good.

291
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,560
[Shelley] <i>He's really worried.</i>

292
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,800
<i>Which makes Cleopatra worried.</i>
[soft chuckle]

293
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,360
<i>But she sends him off to the next battle.</i>

294
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,280
[somber music]

295
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,840
[soldiers clamoring]

296
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,320
[soldier yells]

297
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,800
There's this huge siege.

298
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,400
[tense music]

299
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,840
-[swords clinking]
-[grunting]

300
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,080
Mark Antony is getting desperate.

301
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,000
[Colleen]
He has his archers fire offers of gold

302
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,760
to any of Octavian's forces who defect.

303
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,120
He's having to break the siege.

304
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,120
[Colleen] Mark Antony makes a bold
and risky move against Octavian.

305
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,480
He launches a land
and naval attack simultaneously.

306
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,120
Their forces do meet
right outside of Alexandria

307
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,920
which is a deciding, significant battle.

308
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,120
[grunts]

309
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,560

310

[swords clinking]

311
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,920
[soft music]

312
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,520
General, the Egyptian naval fleet
has defected to Octavian.

313
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,400
No, that can't be true.

314
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,280
I'm afraid it is, General.

315
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,160
No. No, no, no, no. No.

316
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,320
At this point,
nothing is stopping Octavian

317
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,200
from landing in Alexandria.

318
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,080
[soldiers clamoring]

319
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,640
[loud banging]

320
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,680
What was that?

321
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,840
Go and check what is happening, please.

322
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,760
-Okay.
-Quickly.

323
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,000
[soldiers yelling]

324
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,960
[Shelley] Cleopatra was convinced
the gates around Alexandria

325
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,680
could not be breached.

326
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,320
They were well protected.

327
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
[all clamoring]

328
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,440
When Octavian and his troops
make that breach,

329
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,280
it is clear to Cleopatra,

330
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,640
the Egyptian troops have defected.

331
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,440
Which means the country
is in the hands of Octavian.

332
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,400
[melancholy music]

333
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,920
[Shelley] For most of us,
if we were in Cleopatra's situation,

334
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,680
um, the end is nigh.

335
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,600
I think we would have
a nervous breakdown, panic attack.

336
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,840
[yelps, chuckles]

337
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,480
[Charmion] Our defenses are down,
we have to go.

338
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,960
[Shelley] Cleopatra is probably feeling

339
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,560
defiant at this point.

340
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,480
If they are here, it means the general--

341
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,360
Quiet, Iras.

342
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,240
[Charmion] Pharaoh, we have to go now.

343
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,720
[Colleen] Now even if Cleopatra manages
to hold on to her throne

344
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,000
or successfully passes it on
to one of her children,

345
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,400
Egypt is going to be a province
of the Roman Empire.

346
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,560
-Pharaoh, we need to--
-I said be quiet!

347
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,800
[melancholy music]

348
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,840
This needs to get to Antony.

349
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,600
[Charmion] Pharaoh, we have to go now.

350
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,240
Her life's work, her legacy,

351
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,160
it's in danger, if not gone.

352
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,920
[insects chirping]

353
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,000
[tense music]

00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
[Cleopatra] Hurry.

355
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
Hurry!

356
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,040
[Sally-Ann]
Cleopatra gathers all her wealth

357
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,680
in her mausoleum in her tomb.

358
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,080
This is one of her last bargaining chips.

359
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,240
Octavian needs this treasure
to pay his troops.

360
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,760
[Colleen] Cleopatra's tomb
is only partially finished.

361
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,360
She's barricaded inside.

362
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,320
I won't let Octavian capture me.

363
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,360
We're going to burn it all down.

364
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,320
That bastard touches nothing.

365
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,000
[Colleen] Cleopatra is threatening
to set her tomb on fire

366
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,920
and to go up in flames

367
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,200
with her entire treasure.

368
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,680
[Mark Antony] Cleopatra!

369
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,120
Did you hear that?

370
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,040
-[Cleopatra] Mark?
-They're coming. They're coming for us.

371
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,880
-[Mark Antony] Drop something now.
-[panting]

372
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,280
Get a rope, quick!

373
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,880
Hold on, my love!
[grunts]

374
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,160
[panting]

375
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
Pull!

376
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,680
[strained grunt]

377
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,640
[effort grunting]

378
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,880
[Cleopatra screams]

379
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,640
Mark Antony has to actually
be hauled up through a window.

380
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,640
Mark Antony has attempted
to commit suicide

381
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,120
after receiving a note from Cleopatra.

382
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,880
[Shelley] We don't know
what was in that note.

383
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,360
Shakespeare would have us believe

384
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,040
Cleopatra fabricated her own suicide

385
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,160
in the hopes that that would prompt

386
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,680
Mark Antony to commit suicide.

387
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,320
The bravest thing to do,

388
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,560
according to a Roman person,

389
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,600
is to commit suicide.

390
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,840
[Jacquelyn] And this is a way to maintain
your valor and your dignity

391
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,360
-even in the face of death.
-[crying]

392
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,000
Just stay.
[sniffles]

393
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,280
Just stay.

394
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,840
[crying]

395
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,920
{\an8}Cleopatra…

396
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,440
Shh, shh…

397
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,760
[sniffles]

398
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,520
[whimpers]

399
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,120
[Shelley] He wants to die with Cleopatra.

400
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,320
[wailing]

401
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,960
And he dies in Cleopatra's arms.

402
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,720
[somber music]

403
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:49,160
Octavian, our astute politician,
who is also ruthless…

404
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,680
does not want Cleopatra dead

405
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,920
at the hands of the Romans

406
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,880
because she becomes a martyr.

407
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,640
And all those Egyptians
who have defected to Octavian

408
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,960
are gonna rise up in rebellion.

409
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,560
This is a Pharoah.

410
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,520
You do not kill…

411
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,560
a Pharaoh.

412
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,920
To get into her barricaded tomb,

413
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,680
Octavian's men break through the roof.

414
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,280
[distant clattering]

415
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,680
[Cleopatra] Light the torch.

416
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,400
[Roman commander]
You, put that fire out, come on!

417
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,040
Seize her!

418
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,280
Seize her!

419
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,520
[screaming]

420
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,320
I am mistress of the two lands.

421
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,280
Thea Neotera.

422
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,960
I'm a god.

423
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,840
Do not disrespect me.

424
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,720
I would die for Egypt.

425
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,040
What would you die for?

426
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,560
[Cleopatra] No.

427
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,320
[all whimpering]

428
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,280
No. No!

429
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,920
[attendants whimpering]

430
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,120
Stop!

431
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,040
No!

432
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,680
[Shelley]
The soldiers take her to the palace

433
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,640
where she used to receive ambassadors.

434
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,560
Octavian comes in.

435
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,720
They've never met before.

436
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,840
Looks like your African sorcery
failed you this time.

437
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,600
Pharaoh?

438
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,800
You know, your witchcraft
must be very strong

439
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,080
to turn two great sons of Rome
against their own

440
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,320
because the talk
of your beauty flatters you…

441
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,160
immensely.

442
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,320
What are you smiling about?

443
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,680
Witch!

444
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,120
You're a lot shorter
than I thought you'd be.

445
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,680
You know…

446
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,760
your children look just like you.

447
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,680
Especially your eldest.

448
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,400
They'll be a great comfort to you in Rome.

449
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,600
[Shelley] At this point,

450
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,640
Cleopatra believes
that her children are safe.

451
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,920
She has sent them away
with trusted members of her household.

452
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,400
And so, she believes
she has nothing to fear.

453
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,680
You should have just taken my offer
when you had the chance.

454
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,920
I'm going to enjoy
dragging you through the streets.

455
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,920
And those…

456
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,200
bastard half-breeds of yours.

457
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,840
They're gonna watch.

458
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:40,080
[Shelley] She realizes that Octavian
has captured her children.

459
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:46,640
And it always amazes me
that she doesn't crumple at that point.

460
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,480
Get her out of here now!

461
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,840
One of the most important things
that any, uh, Roman military leader can do

462
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,720
to gain the support and love
of the Roman people

463
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:11,240
is to have a remarkable celebration
of his military victory called a triumph.

464
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,160
[Colleen] To complete his victory,

465
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,360
Octavian needs
to bring Cleopatra back to Rome

466
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,160
to parade her in his triumph.

467
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,080
[melancholy music]

468
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,920
[melancholy music continues]

469
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,320
See that this gets to Octavian.

470
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,800
[Cleopatra] Trust me,
he's gonna want to read it.

471
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,480
Don't worry,
we'll all be here when you get back.

472
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,680
[Jacquelyn]
Cleopatra writes a letter to Octavian

473
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,520
requesting that she and Antony
be permitted to be buried together

474
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,520
and to allow her son to inherit Egypt.

475
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,080
[Jacquelyn] What we're seeing
is this last moment of Cleopatra

476
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,120
clinging to this overarching goal
throughout her entire life

477
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,720
of trying to make sure

478
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,280
that the Ptolemaic Dynasty
will not die out.

479
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,920
That Egypt does not become
a province of the Roman Empire.

480
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,400
[Cleopatra] We'll do it together.

481
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,080
It's the right thing to do.

482
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,560
Worthy of a God.

483
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,800
[Shelley] She has a plan.

484
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,120
Cleopatra always has a plan.

485
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:11,920
She's researched poisons
that won't be painful,

486
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,480
that won't distort her body.

487
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:20,120
She decides how she's going to die.

488
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,600
[somber music]

489
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,080
[Shelley] And she decides
with whom she is going to die.

490
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,640
It's not Octavian,

491
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,200
it's not the Roman Senate,

492
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,320
it's Cleopatra.

493
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,560
She is in control.

494
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,760
[somber music]

495
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,120
[somber music continues]

496
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,000
[birds squawking]

497
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,960
[light music]

498
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,640
[approaching footsteps]

499
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,160
[Colleen]
When Octavian receives that letter,

500
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,520
he knows Cleopatra
is not going to come back to Rome

501
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,680
and she has committed suicide.

502
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,400
[somber music]

503
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,600
[Jacquelyn] Being taken in a Roman triumph
would have been tremendously humiliating.

504
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,480
It's very unlikely that Cleopatra
would've been treated with velvet gloves.

505
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,560
Defeated enemies
are usually killed right afterwards.

506
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,280
So she knew that her death
was on the horizon anyway.

507
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,040
There was no way
Octavian could have allowed her to live.

508
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,120
[Colleen] Octavian knows it's over.

509
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:26,720
[Shelley] We do not know the method
with which Cleopatra committed suicide.

510
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,080
The one that every film producer loves

511
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:37,160
is that she died as the result
of the bite of the Egyptian cobra or asp.

512
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,000
[Colleen]
The cobra is a symbol of royalty.

513
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,720
So even if the asp
was not a part of her suicide,

514
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,000
it was a perfect symbol to represent

515
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,400
that she was leaving this world
as queen of Egypt.

516
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,960
[Jacquelyn] Cleopatra and Mark Antony,

517
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,840
their burials have never been found.

518
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,640
We don't know whether or not
she got her last request,

519
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,000
that they get buried together.

520
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:19,040
[Shelley] The quest of archaeologists
looking for Cleopatra's tomb…

521
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,600
futile.

522
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,880
[fire crackling]

523
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,199
[Shelley] Octavian is not going
to allow a tomb

524
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,280
with the remains
of Cleopatra and Mark Antony.

525
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,639
That would have become
a center point for rebellion.

526
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,560
[fire crackling]

527
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,679
It was not the Roman tradition
to entomb bodies.

528
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,239
They didn't mummify bodies, they cremated.

529
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,520
I think Cleopatra and Mark Antony
were cremated.

530
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,920
[somber music]

531
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,840
This is the true turning point in history.

532
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,480
[tense music]

533
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,840
Egypt totally loses its independence.

534
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,040
[indistinct chatter]

535
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,200
[Shelley] It's over.
It becomes a province of Rome.

536
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,800
Egypt's long history
as a great civilization ends.

537
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,720
[Jacquelyn] Egypt now becomes
the grain basket of Rome.

538
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,320
Rome would not have been able
to go on militarily

539
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,960
without being able to spend
vast amounts of Egyptian wealth.

540
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,600
[Jacquelyn] Rome tapped the bank of Egypt
and impoverished it.

541
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,360
It really ends Egypt as the dynastic land
that we think of today.

542
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,840
Cleopatra is the last pharaoh of Egypt.

543
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,680
[epic music]

544
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,680
[Debora] Shortly thereafter,

545
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,280
Octavian has the Senate
declare him Emperor.

546
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,080
The Emperor Augustus.

547
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,920
[Islam] He wanted to be ruler forever.

548
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,720
That was his idea
of what a dictator should be.

549
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,520
[Sally-Ann]
Ironically, like Cleopatra before,

550
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,280
Octavian is elevated as a living god.

551
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,000
[Debora] Cleopatra's death

552
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,520
was one of the… final phases

553
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,520
of what we consider to be ancient Egypt.

554
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,240
[Debora] We still have
Cleopatra's other three children.

555
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,520
[Shelley] The children
of Mark Antony and Cleopatra,

556
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,520
they'll represent a threat to Octavian.

557
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,680
<i>♪ They will come for you and me… ♪</i>

558
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,760
Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene

559
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,200
and little Ptolemy Philadelphus

560
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,240
are taken back to Rome.

561
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,360
<i>♪ From my deepest scar ♪</i>

562
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,760
<i>♪ Oh-oh-oh ♪</i>

563
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,560
However, there is no way
that he could permit Caesarion to live.

564
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,680
[Shelley] Caesarion was raised
to be a Pharoah.

565
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,160
He could rise up,

566
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,800
he could say, "I am Caesar's son.

567
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,040
I should be ruling Rome."

568
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,240
He's just too big a threat to Octavian.

569
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,760
So he is executed.

570
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,320
He, he is killed.

571
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,200
[Debora] When Octavian takes
the children back to Rome,

572
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,200
he parades them
behind an effigy of Cleopatra

573
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,080
with a snake or an asp clasped to her arm.

574
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,040
He humiliates them publicly

575
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,360
by having them walk behind
this effigy of their mother

576
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,880
and weighing them down with gold chains.

577
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,120
The chains were supposedly so heavy

578
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,120
that they were stumbling
and they could barely walk.

579
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,800
[Debora] People actually felt sympathy
for the children,

580
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,040
but after that,

581
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,720
he sent them, surprisingly,

582
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,360
to live with his sister, Octavia,

583
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,720
who was Mark Antony's wife

584
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,760
when these children were conceived.

585
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,320
[Sally-Ann] So the long-suffering Octavia
brings up Mark Antony's children.

586
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,320
The two boys fall off
the historical radar,

587
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,040
but Cleopatra Selene
marries Juba of Mauretania.

588
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,440
So, Cleopatra Selene, ironically,

589
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,400
becomes another African queen.

590
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,040
Cleopatra Selene rules over
a sumptuous court

591
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,080
at the capital of Mauretania,

592
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,280
much like Alexandria.

593
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,160
[Colleen] Cleopatra Selene's court
is also filled

594
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,680
with literature and philosophy and art.

595
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,960
Selene, like her mother before her,
has constructed a tomb.

596
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,200
It's one of the most impressive
of the ancient world.

597
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,200
[Sally-Ann] We know from some
of the remains in her tomb

598
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,200
and from the sides of their palaces,

599
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,800
that she actually took Egyptian statues
to her palaces

600
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,120
to continue that connection
to her mother and her homeland.

601
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,360
[Debora] <i>She has a son
who becomes her and her husband's heir.</i>

602
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,600
[Shelley] <i>She named that son, Ptolemy,
after Cleopatra's father.</i>

603
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,720
That dynasty continues, though,

604
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,880
because her granddaughter

605
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,240
marries into the Roman Imperial family.

606
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,280
And so Cleopatra lives on.

607
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,800
[Shelley] Even in antiquity,
she lived on through her daughter

608
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,600
and she lived on through her grandson.

609
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,680
[epic music]

610
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,400
Cleopatra is significant
in that she is the last ruler

611
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,960
of an independent, powerful Egypt.

612
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,320
[Debora] <i>We think about
female empowerment.</i>

613
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,320
There is no Rome without Egypt.

614
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,960
This is a woman exercising power.

615
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,480
[Colleen] <i>Cleopatra was trying
to save the country</i>

616
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,760
<i>that she loved from destruction.</i>

617
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,440
[Cleopatra] <i>I am Isis.</i>

618
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,120
Queen of Kings!

619
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,840
I would die for Egypt.

620
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,800
[Cleopatra] <i>What would you die for?</i>

621
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,120
[Colleen] <i>She has become an icon.</i>

622
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,240
I resisted Cleopatra
for a really long time.

623
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,520
Uh, in my scholarly life.

624
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,680
I said, "I am not gonna study you.
I'm not gonna study you."

625
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,480
I would have this recurring dream
where there was this shadowy figure,

626
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,280
certainly an ancient person,
clearly a woman,

627
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,240
who would say to me,

628
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,720
"You have to tell my story."

629
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,680
"You have to do it."

630
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,880
I want people to know
the story of Cleopatra

631
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,640
because she was an African queen.

632
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,600
And that's a fact that's been buried,

633
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,760
it's been erased, it's been white-washed.

634
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:22,720
Generation after generation
are absolutely mesmerized by Cleopatra.

635
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,800
Her story resonates,

636
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,440
I think, with every woman.

637
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,960
[narrator] <i>Cleopatra was one
of the most influential rulers</i>

638
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,360
<i>the world has ever known.</i>

639
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:45,680
<i>Her legacy as the most famous
of all African Queens is assured.</i>

640
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,920
[Shelley] She will live on until…

641
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,080
there's no one else to tell her story.
