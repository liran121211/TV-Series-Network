1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,005
Ah! There it is, Thundera.

2
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:09,574
Never before has there been
such a beautiful, peaceful,

3
00:00:09,618 --> 00:00:12,229
and harmonious place
in the universe.

4
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:13,773
But alas...

5
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:18,931
Everything 'splodes someday.

6
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:22,370
Oh, hey, looks like someone
made it out of the explosion.

7
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:25,329
Oh, cool,
it's the ThunderCats.

8
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:26,417
Check 'em out.

9
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:28,202
Well, we've got Lion-O,

10
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:30,508
the brand-new
Lord of the ThunderCats.

11
00:00:30,552 --> 00:00:31,944
And Tygra.

12
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:33,685
He's got a rope
with balls on it.

13
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:35,078
Oh, and Panthro.

14
00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:37,341
He builds stuff
and has nunchucks.

15
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:38,885
Cheetara,

16
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:41,345
the fastest person
in the universe.

17
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:43,608
Wilykit and Wilykat
are the kids.

18
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:47,047
And Snarf, whatever he is.

19
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,399
Anyways, the ThunderCats, last
survivors of their home world,

20
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:54,750
off to travel the universe to...

21
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:57,057
Or, uh...

22
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,408
Maybe they're just gonna land right
there on this random planet.

23
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:02,105
Oh, well.

24
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:05,891
Aw, thundertoots, it's the
Mutants of Plun-Darr.

25
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:08,372
They're the sworn enemies
of the ThunderCats,

26
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,809
and class-A jerks.

27
00:01:10,853 --> 00:01:13,551
Well, it looks like the ThunderCats
are gonna have their hands full.

28
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:16,076
So, I better get outta here.

29
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:19,122
Oh, what? Who am I?
My name's Jaga.

30
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,081
I was on Thundera
when it blew up.

31
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:23,909
So,
now I'm a ghost.

32
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:41,623
Blasted Mutants.

33
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,451
Guess it's up to me
to salvage the scraps,

34
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:45,627
which is awesome!

35
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,270
I bet I could build a whole heap
of thunder tanks with this stuff!

36
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:50,193
- Oh, yeah!
- That was amazing.

37
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:52,242
- Let's wind it back up and do it again.
- Choo-choo!

38
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:55,419
Uh, what kind of planet
did we end up on?

39
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:58,248
There is literally
nothing here.

40
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:00,172
What's the point of being
the coolest ThunderCat

41
00:02:00,196 --> 00:02:02,339
if you don't even have
any fans around? Ooh!

42
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:04,428
Come on now, Cheetara.

43
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:07,736
I think we can say we're all
the coolest ThunderCats.

44
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,175
Okay, well,
at least we're alive.

45
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,437
And what's more important,

46
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:15,309
we've protected
the rightful heir

47
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:17,485
to the throne
of Thundera, Lion-O,

48
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:21,184
chosen by our ancestors to
lead us through all hardships.

49
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,274
Hello?

50
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:26,478
Yeah, I need someone to lead
me through this hard ship.

51
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:28,922
It's really dark in here.

52
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:32,978
Lion-O, can you hear me?
Use the Sword of Omens.

53
00:02:33,022 --> 00:02:35,155
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

54
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:38,897
I now wield Thundera's most powerful
magic within my very hands.

55
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,464
Yeah, that's the spirit.

56
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:43,032
Sword of Omens,
give me a hole in the wall!

57
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:46,731
Lion-O, don't use it
like a can opener. It's a...

58
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:50,300
Huh! Could've sworn
Tygra was right here.

59
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:52,346
Come on, Snarf.
Gotta be around somewhere.

60
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:56,001
Whoa-ho-ho!

61
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:57,481
Just look at this place!

62
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:59,570
This planet is amazing!

63
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:01,224
Let's see what
we've got here. Ooh!

64
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:05,010
We've got a spooky swamp,
a creepy mountain,

65
00:03:05,054 --> 00:03:07,230
and weird little guys
hiding behind rocks?

66
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:08,579
Don't look at me!

67
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:10,581
This place is
chock-full of trouble,

68
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,322
and as
Lord of the ThunderCats,

69
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,890
it is my duty to explore
all that stuff

70
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:18,023
and deal with
any dangerous baddies.

71
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:21,244
No, Lion-O. Come on, no,
that's not your duty at all.

72
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:23,246
Now, if you don't mind?

73
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,857
Sorry, Tygra. I'll get
you out of there real quick.

74
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,685
Sword of Omens,

75
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:30,210
- give me, a hole in this thing!
- Oh, no! Not that, no!

76
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:32,777
Wow, my first day
as Lord of the ThunderCats,

77
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:34,518
and I already saved
your life, Tygra.

78
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:36,062
So, anyways,
I have to go exploring.

79
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:37,695
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Lion-O,

80
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,899
a good leader can't just
take off and abandon his team.

81
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:42,222
What? I'm not
abandoning my team.

82
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:43,571
I'm gonna go out there,

83
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:45,268
find some dangerous stuff
and fight it.

84
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:46,443
You know, like a leader.

85
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:47,987
Ugh...

86
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,708
Look, Lion-O, us ThunderCats
are trapped here,

87
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:54,712
and the only way we're gonna survive
this thing is by sticking together.

88
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:57,367
Yeah, I mean, our planet
did just blow up.

89
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:58,716
Yeah.

90
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,805
So, as Lord
of the ThunderCats,

91
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,417
you can't just go running off and
having adventures by yourself.

92
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,070
I mean, just think about it.

93
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:06,994
What if someone attacked us
while you were gone?

94
00:04:07,018 --> 00:04:08,726
Someone like us?

95
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,251
Uh, yeah,
like the Mutants, for example.

96
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:14,645
You escaped us once, but
this is the end of the road.

97
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,189
Yeah!

98
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:22,784
Whoa! Way to whiff
the shot, Slithe.

99
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:24,742
Uh-oh!

100
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:28,006
Come on, Wilykat.

101
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,271
Oh, yeah, who's the best?
Oh, yeah, I'm the best?

102
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:35,971
- Gotcha!
- Never mind, Cheetara's the best. Whoo-hoo!

103
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:38,800
Whoa! Way to go, Cheetara.
Let's see here.

104
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:43,108
Hey, Tygra, what's the word I say
to make the sword do magic stuff?

105
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:45,850
Like, what stuff specifically?

106
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:47,461
Oh, never mind.
I think I got it.

107
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:50,594
Sword of Omens, do...

108
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:53,118
...a...

109
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:54,468
...thing!

110
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,339
That was
not the right word.

111
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:00,822
Nice try,
ThunderDorks!

112
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:02,693
But we still have one blaster,

113
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:05,609
and it looks like
you're fresh out of swords.

114
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:08,612
Hey, only I get to blast
my stuff into bits.

115
00:05:08,656 --> 00:05:09,961
And you ain't me.

116
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:11,505
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

117
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:16,446
No, no, no, no!

118
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,624
We'll get you
for this, BlunderCats!

119
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:23,888
That was amazing!

120
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:26,369
See, Lion-O,
it was just like I said.

121
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:28,545
We needed you here
when the Mutants attacked.

122
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:32,332
No,
it's just like I said.

123
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,072
Those Mutants are out there

124
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:36,236
and I gotta go take care
of 'em before they come back.

125
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,163
How can that possibly be
the lesson you learned?

126
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:39,767
Okay, here's my leader-type
plan thingy.

127
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,906
Uh, you guys stay here,
build the base,

128
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,908
and I'm going
to catch those Mutants.

129
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:48,739
I'm doing leading!
Whoo-hoo!

130
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:56,660
Almost forgot
my magic sword thing. Ha-ha!

131
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:58,009
We're doomed.

132
00:05:58,053 --> 00:05:59,553
Relax, Tygra.

133
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:02,034
Lion-O's got Snarf with him.

134
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,841
Not to mention,
the Sword of Omens.

135
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:05,925
What makes you think he knows
how to use that thing?

136
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,368
Yeah. I mean, he did just
throw it at a spaceship.

137
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,544
And did it or did it not
totally work?

138
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:12,023
- Fair point.
- Mmm.

139
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:14,069
That was
some move if you ask me.

140
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:16,152
- Yeah, but it wasn't as cool as yours.
- Ha-ha! Yeah.

141
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:17,716
You were like,
"Nobody breaks my stuff."

142
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:21,381
What did I say
about breaking my stuff?

143
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:24,253
Argh!

144
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:26,560
I'm just messing with you.

145
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:28,953
He got us there.

146
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:31,826
Now quit standing around and
help me pile up all this scrap.

147
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,394
Oh, thank you, kind sir.

148
00:06:36,308 --> 00:06:39,399
I am Berbil Bill,
a Berbil of Third Earth.

149
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,444
Uh, hi, Berbil.

150
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:44,099
Get back, Panthro. We don't know
anything about these creatures.

151
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:45,927
Even the subtlest interaction

152
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,799
could have catastrophic effects
on its entire ecosystem!

153
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:50,453
Oh, that's okay.

154
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:52,107
Your spaceship
pretty much crashed

155
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,239
right in the middle
of our ecosystem.

156
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:56,894
Behold our beautiful village.

157
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:00,463
Looking good, everyone.

158
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:01,725
I thought you said

159
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:03,335
there was nothing here,
Cheetara.

160
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:05,729
Uh, I guess I never looked,
uh, behind me.

161
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:08,732
You must be starving
after destroying our home.

162
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:10,430
Please, have some candy fruit.

163
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:12,823
- Thanks?
- Oh, boy!

164
00:07:14,695 --> 00:07:16,914
I suppose we better help them
build their little town?

165
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,481
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

166
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:20,265
Berbils will help new friends

167
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:22,746
build their new home
right here on Third Earth.

168
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,313
Berbils love to build.

169
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:25,636
Yeah, but what about
your vill...

170
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,924
Hello, new friend.

171
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:30,188
Berbils build fast.

172
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:34,279
Well, I do always carry blueprints
around for a super awesome lair.

173
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:35,585
Convenient.

174
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:37,587
Thank you.
We'll get started right away.

175
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:39,284
Follow me, Berbils.

176
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:42,113
He's got it upside down.

177
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:44,942
Look, everyone. Blueprints.

178
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:46,640
Blue...

179
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:48,723
Well, at least you don't have
to worry about Lion-O.

180
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,807
Yeah, I mean, if these little
Berbils can live here,

181
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:52,311
Third Earth
must be a paradise.

182
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,039
Oh, yes. We love
everything about Third Earth.

183
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,583
Except Mumm-Ra.

184
00:07:57,825 --> 00:07:59,130
He's so evil,

185
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:00,784
a magic bolt of lightning
strikes you

186
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:02,699
every time
you say his name.

187
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:04,962
Which is Mumm-Ra.

188
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:07,704
Yup, everything about
Third Earth is great.

189
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:10,315
- Well, that's...
- Except for Mumm-Ra.

190
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:12,622
Stop. You don't have to keep
saying his name.

191
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,625
That's okay. We just like
being helpful.

192
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:18,193
- Thank you.
- Especially when it comes to Mumm-Ra.

193
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:24,504
Oh, hey,
did someone say Mumm-Ra?

194
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:28,986
I have to say,
I'm a little concerned

195
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,640
about Lion-O
running into this Mumm...

196
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:32,250
Shh!

197
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:34,426
- Running into this guy.
- Eh, it's a big planet.

198
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,907
Yeah, let's just hope
he stays somewhat discreet.

199
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:39,867
Whoo-hoo!

200
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,790
I'm Lion-O, Lord of the ThunderCats,
and I'm swinging on a vine! Yee-haw!

201
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,567
Oh! Uh-oh.

202
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:47,875
Hyah!

203
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:50,573
Hey, frog. What do you
know about the Mutants?

204
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:52,749
Hey, bug, tell me
where the Mutants are.

205
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:58,189
Tell me where the Mutants are, bees!

206
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:00,931
Please tell me
about the Mutants, turtle.

207
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:03,673
Fess up about the Mutants, bats.

208
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:05,893
Fess up
about the Mutants, bird.

209
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:08,286
Fess up
about the Mutants, egg.

210
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,288
Fess up about the Mutants,
littler bird.

211
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:12,508
Hey, you, Mutants,
tell me where... Oh!

212
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,076
- Huh?
- Huh?

213
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,686
- Huh?
- Uh...

214
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,558
You better surrender

215
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,761
or you'll have to face the
wrath of the Sword of Omens.

216
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:23,258
Vultureman, Jackalman,
Monkian, back in the ship!

217
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,218
Hmm...

218
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:29,582
Why do you think they're heading
back in their broken ship?

219
00:09:29,606 --> 00:09:31,614
Ah! It's not broken!

220
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:36,053
Whoa! Ha-ha!

221
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:38,497
Now this is what the Lord of the
ThunderCats should be doing.

222
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:39,622
Whoo-hoo!

223
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,884
Whee!

224
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:42,973
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whee!

225
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:47,064
Gah! Don't just sit there, Mutants!
Do some damage.

226
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:50,241
Not to our own ship.
To the ThunderCat!

227
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:52,287
Ha-ha! I could do this
all day, Snarf.

228
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,725
What gives...
Whoa. Ah!

229
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:58,423
Ha-ha! You're trapped,
ThunderDunce.

230
00:09:58,467 --> 00:10:00,730
Now prepare to taste laser.

231
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:02,274
But I already ate lunch.

232
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:09,803
Whoa.

233
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:16,311
Wow, Snarf. It looks
like you're a robot.

234
00:10:16,354 --> 00:10:17,921
And you're out of blasters.

235
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:20,097
Right you are, Lion-Guy.

236
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:22,012
Vultureman,
prepare the bombs.

237
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,797
Oh! Ha-ha! Yes, sir.

238
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,340
Boop!

239
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:31,456
Well, Snarf, I don't suppose you've
got any more tricks up your sleeve?

240
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:37,288
Oh, doots!

241
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:40,640
Launch in five, four...

242
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:47,232
We're still alive!

243
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:48,909
What?

244
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:55,306
Fools!

245
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,309
No one loiters on the
front lawn of Mumm-Ra,

246
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,355
the Ever-Living!

247
