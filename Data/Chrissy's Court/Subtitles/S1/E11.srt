00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:01,923
Today, on Chrissy's Court...

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,012
Isaiah David is suing
his former best friend,

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:08,798
Chandra Bouchard,
for an unpaid loan of $300.

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:11,554
Chandra claims that Isaiah
is just a hater,

5
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:15,097
and the only thing she's guilty
of is living her best life.

6
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,562
The people are real, the cases are real,

7
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,944
and the judgments are legally binding,

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,941
no matter how unqualified the judge is.

9
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,194
- This is Chrissy's Court.

10
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:31,451
- Please rise...

11
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,332
to an Honama...

12
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,408
the Honorable...

13
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,544
Oh, my God.

14
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,081
Please rise...

15
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,964
to an Honoma...

16
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,421
Honorable Judge...

17
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,381
for an Honorable Judge...

18
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,842
- For the Honorable Judge Chrissy Teigen.

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,640
- Judge Chrissy Teigen.

20
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,555
Hi, Judge.
- Hello, Mother.

21
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,519
You may be seated.

22
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,099
So, Isaiah, you are suing Chandra...

23
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,725
- That's correct.
- ...for a $300 loan.

24
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,113
- Yes. Um, my ex-friend here, Chandra...

25
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,109
- Ex-friend?

26
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,530
- Ex-friend, yeah.
- Okay.

27
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,108
- I no longer deal with her.

28
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,953
Chandra, aka Budget Barbie,

29
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,948
was struggling financially.
She was, like,

30
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,200
crying, breaking down.

31
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:14,582
I was like, "Hey, like, don't worry.

32
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,198
"As a friend, I got you.
Here's $300, but as long

33
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,196
as you pay me back..."
- Was this an oral agreement,

34
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,868
or is there a contract?
- We didn't sign anything.

35
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,166
It was basically a verbal agreement.

36
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,999
Like, she was my best friend, so I tri...

37
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,094
I put all of my trust in her
that she was gonna pay me back.

38
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,510
So I gave her the $300,
and the next thing I know,

39
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,299
I see her on Instagram,
she's out in Vegas

40
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,512
living her best life.
I'm like,

41
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,012
this is the same girl
that was crying broke,

42
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,853
and now she's, like, poolside in Vegas

43
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,308
turning up with bottles and...

44
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,308
- Awkward.

45
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:38,769
- So, I do have a photo

46
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,729
that I, uh, was able to screenshot...

47
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,099
- Okay.
- ...from her Instagram

48
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,556
before she blocked me.

49
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,105
- Oof. Ooh, you blocked him.

50
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,230
Oh...

51
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,476
- He deserved it.
He deserved it.

52
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,317
- Oh. Living best life.

53
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,953
"LBL."

54
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,741
Okay. So, Chandra, your defense.

55
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,035
- Throughout our whole friendship, he was

56
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,618
a great friend to me,
I was a great friend to him...

57
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,044
- How long was this friendship?
- We've known each other

58
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,332
for, like, seven months,
about, eight months.

59
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,496
- I honestly thought you were
gonna say seven, eight years.

60
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,165
- No.

61
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,923
- No.
- So, I was out of work

62
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,715
for three months,
and I had a family emergency.

63
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,299
So he being the good friend that he was,

64
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,545
he let me borrow the $300.

65
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,768
- You had a family emergency in Vegas?

66
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,518
- No, no, this is before Vegas.

67
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,270
- Okay.
- I ended up going to Vegas

68
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,692
for my 21st birthday.

69
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,690
And that wasn't something I funded myself.

70
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,692
My friends took me out for my birthday,

71
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,904
because, you know, you don't pay
for your own birthday.

72
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,404
Like, you know what I mean?

73
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,986
So, I mean...
- Well, some people do.

74
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,571
- I think that he got really irritated

75
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,196
'cause I didn't invite him.

76
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,582
And I think it was because

77
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,620
he wants something more
than a friendship,

78
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,913
so that's why I think that

79
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,456
I don't have to pay the money back.

80
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,751
- Really?
- Yes.

81
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:47,884
- This is definitely false.

82
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,960
I've never tried to take her on a date

83
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,125
a day in my life.

84
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,843
- What has he ever done

85
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,683
to make you think that
he's into you, romantically?

86
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,839
- Honestly, nothing.

87
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,007
No, literally nothing. Like...

88
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,216
- You guys might have to drug-test her.

89
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,715
- We do not do drug tests here.

90
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,597
I wish we did.
Not on me, but everyone else.

91
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,475
- I have a text here, too.
- Okay.

92
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,192
Can I see that?
Thank you.

93
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,861
Basically, Chandra, you ghosted him.

94
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,112
- Yeah, because he's being so rude.

95
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,073
- Well, he said,
"Hey, where have you been?"

96
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,073
You responded, "Who's this?"

97
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,235
- Yeah, like...

98
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,784
Like, at that point I was pissed.

99
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,788
I'm like, okay, like,
this is the same person...

100
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,830
- Like, did you delete
his number or something?

101
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,373
- Yeah, I deleted his number,
and it's like, I don't need

102
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,366
that negativity in my life, like...

103
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,167
- And then he says,

104
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,671
"You've been ghosting me.
I lent you money. You ran off.

105
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,303
What the ...? Seriously?
This is how you treat me? Wow."

106
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,301
You go on to say, "You text me
every day about all of this.

107
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,764
Of course I'm gonna ghost you."

108
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,139
I mean, he...

109
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,851
he wants his m...
- But he won't text--

110
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,561
he won't text me,
like, just to hang out.

111
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,891
He's only texting me
about the money, it's like...

112
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,896
- 'Cause you don't have money to hang out.

113
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:48,938
You don't even have money
to pay your bills.

114
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,311
Where are we gonna hang out at,
the street?

115
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,067
Like, where are we gonna go?
Like, you don't...

116
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,359
Like, I can't pay for everything, like...

117
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,612
- I mean, yeah, at some point
you have to resolve

118
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,363
this part of it so you can go out again

119
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,855
and hang out as normal friends.

120
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,736
So, I mean,
what is your defense here, even?

121
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,084
Because... you know you owe that money.

122
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,120
- It wasn't like I wasn't trying
to pay him back, though.

123
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,785
Like, I was out of work
for three months before

124
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,003
he loaned it to me, so I basically...
- But you were working

125
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,503
when I first met you,
and then you took a break,

126
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,995
'cause you had a family emergency.

127
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,796
You came back, and you're
still at the same job,

128
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,090
because I spoke to Alexis,
and she says

129
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,133
that you're still working there.

130
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,176
- Ooh...
- So I know where you're at.

131
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,178
I know that you're making money.
- Yeah, I know.

132
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,970
You've been there. You've been stalking.
- You're working.

133
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,345
- You've been stalking me.
- You make good tips.

134
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,471
- Like, you can say
that you don't go there,

135
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,847
but you stalk me there.
- Order.

136
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,654
Talk to the judge, please.

137
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,188
- Thank you, Mom.

138
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,811
- You're welcome.
- So, you both work

139
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,818
in the same mall,
so you see each other often.

140
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,360
- We see each other often,
but you haven't paid me back,

141
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,533
and you've been working...
- Yeah.

142
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,861
Because you've been rude about it.

143
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,356
Like, it's a-- it's, like
a pride thing at this point.

144
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,117
- It's my money. It's my money.

145
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,699
Like, I need my money back.
Like, I can be as rude as I want to be.

146
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,294
- He wants his money.
- Yeah.

147
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,749
And I wanna give it back,
but he has to ask nicely.

148
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,119
- No.

149
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,166
It doesn't matter how he asks for it.

150
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,380
What's he supposed to do?
I mean, this...

151
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:04,604
You can't ghost somebody
that you owe money towards.

152
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,810
Like, he did you the solid.
He did you the favor.

153
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,390
That's obvious.
You owe him $300.

154
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,096
So my judgment is for the plaintiff

155
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,266
in the form of $300.

156
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,725
I will see you at the mall.

157
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,026
- Thank you, Your Honor.

158
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,569
Thank you.
- You guys can go.

159
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,656
Is that not the most obvious case ever?

160
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,369
- Yeah.
- Was that not

161
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,239
the most obvious case you've
ever heard in your entire life?

162
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,996
- Good job.
- Like, why should you have

163
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,868
to ask for your money back nicely?

164
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,745
Please can you pay me back?

165
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,093
- The situation will
definitely make me think twice

166
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,879
about asking a friend for money.

167
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,672
Never doing that again.

168
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,045
- There's just no possibility

169
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,722
that I would ever want to date her.

170
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,260
And that's that.

171
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,393
- I should have charged her more
just for being

172
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,310
such a brat about it
- Yeah. Get her for interest.
