00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:02,213
Today on Chrissy's Court,

2
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:04,714
Claudia McClellan is suing her roommate

3
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:06,796
Cooper Kelly for using her car

4
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:08,932
without permission
while she was out of town.

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,219
Cooper can't believe
he's getting sued for $30.

6
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:16,184
And the only thing
he's guilty of is killing it.

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,306
The people are real, the cases are real

8
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,984
and the judgments are legally binding,

9
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,734
no matter how unqualified the judge is.

10
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,356
- This is Chrissy's Court.

11
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,739
- All rise to the Honorable Judge

12
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,406
Chrissy Teigen.

13
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,155
- Hello, everybody.

14
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:39,787
- Hi, Judge.
- Hello, Mom. Ooh.

15
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,083
- Hi. I like your hair.
- Nice hair.

16
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,917
- You, too.
- Thank you.

17
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,382
None of it's mine.
You may be seated.

18
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,634
Claudia and Cooper.

19
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,835
You guys both live in Utah?

20
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:51,886
- Yes.
- Yes, ma'am.

21
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,469
- Okay. I was born in Utah.

22
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,684
- Ooh.
- Claudia,

23
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:55,973
you are our plaintiff,

24
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,926
so go ahead and explain your case here.

25
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,187
- I went on a family vacation
to the Bahamas,

26
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,020
and left my car key with Cooper,
who is my roommate, so that

27
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,688
he could move my car for emergencies only.

28
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,276
But I came back home and realized

29
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,781
that my gas tank was on E.

30
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,284
Side note: I filled up my car
right before I left.

31
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,906
- So, Claudia, you actually have witnesses

32
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,334
that were home at the time
that Cooper drove your car.

33
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,793
Do you want to bring them out?

34
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,423
- Yeah. Let's bring them out.
- All right.

35
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,625
Welcome to court.

36
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,923
This is very serious.

37
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,677
Game faces only here.

38
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,969
Please welcome Kylee and Aspynn,

39
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,893
who are also your roommates, right?
- Yes.

40
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,142
- You guys have a four-bedroom house?

41
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,813
- Five.
- Five-bedroom house? Utah, man.

42
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,813
- I know.

43
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,725
- So, Kylee and Aspynn,

44
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,943
tell us a little bit about,
uh, what you witnessed.

45
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:51,404
- So, we are actually here
to sue Cooper and Claudia...

46
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,606
for the security deposit,

47
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,577
for everything that
they've ruined in the house.

48
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,328
- Honestly, who gives a crap
about their $30?

49
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,411
- Yeah.
- When we are worried about

50
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,456
our $1,500 security deposit.

51
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,040
- Oh.
- Okay, wait. Okay, hold on.

52
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,085
So, Claudia, you go ahead and go next

53
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,210
to Cooper now, I guess.

54
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,916
We have not experienced

55
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,876
this kind of twist here
at Chrissy's Court yes.

56
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,466
- This is a plot twist.

57
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,761
- Kylee Barrett and Aspynn Adams

58
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,755
are suing their roommates
for the security deposit

59
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,967
on the house they all share.

60
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,308
And you already know these guys.

61
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,944
- Kylee, Aspynn, tell us

62
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,363
about this part of the case now.

63
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,572
- We actually have video evidence.

64
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,692
- Okay, let's go.

65
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,504
- Oh, man.

66
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,329
- Oh, my God. This is the Utah
I want people to know exists.

67
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,376
This is the Utah I love.

68
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,091
Okay, whose room is that?

69
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,211
- So, that's my bedroom.

70
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,967
- Did you do that with the intent

71
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,429
of crashing through the door?
- Absolutely.

72
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,510
- Okay.
- And there is, there definitely

73
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,264
is a backstory to this, uh, door-breaking.

74
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,556
- Yes.
- It was already broken.

75
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,350
- But it was already broken
because those two were fighting

76
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,194
like they always do.

77
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,310
- So, Kylee and Aspynn,

78
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,726
you guys have any proof

79
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,324
of this security deposit?
- We have our lease right here.

80
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,360
- Okay, perfect. I personally lost...
- Please.

81
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,993
- ...every security deposit I've ever had.

82
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,741
I have bulldogs. I have never
gotten my security deposit back.

83
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,985
What is your rent for the entire house?

84
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,157
- $1,690.

85
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,544
- $1,600 is, like, my Postmates weekly.

86
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,803
So the security deposit

87
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,630
was $1,500 for the entire house?

88
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,176
- Yeah.
- This is just gonna...

89
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,890
I'm never gonna get tired
of hearing-- This is amazing.

90
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,761
- So, we...
- And you don't believe
you're gonna get that back.

91
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,808
- I don't.
- No.
- Just the security deposit?

92
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:45,982
I mean, does that even cover a door?

93
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,349
I feel like a door is more than $1,500.

94
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,846
- Not a door

95
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,807
from Utah.

96
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:51,938
A door from Utah's like 20 bucks.

97
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,404
- I need to do my research here.

98
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,153
- And she has a family dog
that she likes to bring over

99
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,485
quite frequently, and his name is Ozzie

100
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,281
and he broke some of our blinds as well.

101
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,195
- Ooh. Shredded.
- Okay, so Claudia and Cooper,

102
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,414
I-I understand this was
completely sprung on you.

103
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,664
Do you have any kind of defense?

104
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:10,917
- I do not think that $1,500
is-- in damages.

105
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,631
Maybe $300 at most.

106
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,132
- Okay. Let me think for a second.

107
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,805
I'm gonna rule in favor of the plaintiffs

108
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,602
for the damages incurred to the house.

109
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,305
Um, I'm assuming the doorframe
came off the hinges, everything,

110
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,526
so we're gonna do $200 for that,
the blinds: $100.

111
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,188
Any kind of paintings
that are around the house

112
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,986
just from, I'm sure, random frolicking,

113
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,281
which probably occurred as well: $50.

114
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,525
And an installation fee
for all of that: $100.

115
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,987
So that's $450.

116
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:48,957
$225 from each of you
go to the plaintiffs.

117
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,919
And then that $30 gas
from Cooper to Claudia.

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That is my ruling, so...

119
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,417
court is dismissed.
- Thank you.

120
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,705
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

121
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,628
- Thank you.

122
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:05,096
- I was not expecting for my own
witnesses to turn against me.

123
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,720
And those girls Aspynn and Kylee
are messy, too.

124
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,348
They're not just angels.

125
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,654
- They owe us money now to get that fixed

126
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,438
and then, I think they're
a little upset about it,

127
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,483
but here we are.

128
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,107
- Sounds like fun house, though.
- I know.

129
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,954
I honestly think it seems super fun.

130
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,569
I would definitely have
Snapchatted that body slam, too.

131
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,946
That was really good.
