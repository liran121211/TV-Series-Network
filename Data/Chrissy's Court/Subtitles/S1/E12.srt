00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:01,963
Today on Chrissy's Court,

2
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:05,094
Cassie Sanchez is suing
her ex-boyfriend James Fowler

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,592
for the cost of a car title loan

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,144
that she took out for him
and he never paid back.

5
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:14,179
James believes he's paid her back...
in other ways.

6
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,684
The people are real, the cases are real

7
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,228
and the judgments are legally binding,

8
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,942
no matter how unqualified the judge is.

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,613
- This is Chrissy's Court.

10
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,991
- All rise...

11
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,907
...to the honorable... Judge Judy.

12
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,709
I know, I cannot do it.

13
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,379
Very sorry.

14
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,958
- All rise

15
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,053
to the honorable-- honor...

16
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,633
- To an-- the honorable, um...

17
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,375
- You got it.

18
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,797
- The honorable Judge Chrissy Teigen.

19
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,057
My daughter.

20
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,638
- Wow. That was incredible.

21
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,433
- Judge Judy.

22
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,688
- Hello, everybody. Please be seated.

23
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,440
Cassie, you are suing James,
your ex-boyfriend.

24
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:06,984
Cassie, explain your case.

25
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,567
- James and I began dating
about three years ago.

26
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,034
We've been on and off.
Right now we're off.

27
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,695
He was expecting a settlement.

28
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:15,833
- From what kind of case?

29
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,409
- It was from an auto accident.

30
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,544
So I agreed to cosign on a title loan.

31
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,082
And the agreement was
that he was gonna pay it off

32
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,875
in a month or two,
when he got the settlement.

33
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,709
- Okay.
- You know, it's been over a year.

34
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,304
He's not been able to hold down a job,

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,920
he's been in and out of jail
and when he does have money,

36
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,678
he refuses to pay me back.

37
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,509
He just-- he wants to spend it
on his remote-control car.

38
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,347
- James.
- Yeah.

39
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,182
- I will say that I love those things.

40
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,017
James was expecting

41
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,522
a settlement of $10,000,

42
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,145
and it ended up only being $500.
Why is that?

43
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,982
- 'Cause my attorney sucked.

44
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,107
- That's what I thought.

45
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:54,615
- Did he help with any payments
throughout this process?

46
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,658
- No.
- James.

47
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,332
Do you have a job?

48
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,501
- Um... Not at the time.
- No.

49
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,420
Not really ever.

50
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,038
- I was dealing with, um, incarceration.

51
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,786
- And it's hard to get out of that,
honestly. It's...

52
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,588
- Yeah. Probation...
- It's a tough thing to climb

53
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,421
out of once you are in.

54
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,548
- He had money to pay for his car.

55
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,635
It was over $1,000.

56
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,559
- Your shoes are killing me,
with the... the-the squeakiness.

57
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,642
- Yeah.
- All right.

58
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,016
Stop squeaking.

59
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,563
God!

60
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,653
That was an expensive remote-control car.

61
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,145
Can I see it?

62
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,777
And play with it?

63
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,073
- Yeah, can I approach?

64
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,316
- Yes, please.

65
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,947
- Can I see the car, please?

66
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,044
Ooh.

67
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,459
Your shoes are [bleep] killing me
right now.

68
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:46,539
They are-- are they not
the squeakiest things on the planet?

69
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,035
- It's a little bit...
- Oh, God.

70
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,546
Oh. Don't put it up here. Put it down.

71
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:51,669
You do it.

72
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,005
- No. I don't want to ruin it.

73
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,385
You're telling me this is $1,100,

74
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,849
this car?
- Yeah.

75
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,270
- So...
- This is what he's put
before our relationship.

76
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,429
- Here, Judge, you try.

77
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,976
Ooh!
- Oh, that's so cool! I love it.

78
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,653
Case goes to the plainti-- I-- no, I'm--

79
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,901
case goes to the defendant, sorry.

80
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,193
- Try to go backwards.

81
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,106
- Shit!
- I...

82
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,454
- Oh, my God, I'm...

83
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,449
Oh, this is cool.

84
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,491
- There you go. You got it.

85
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,025
- Holy shit.

86
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,908
I'm so scared!
No, I don't want to do it anymore.

87
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,325
Can you drive it? Show me, like, tricks.

88
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,463
Like, go in between things and do stuff.

89
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,670
- Probably can go on turbo.

90
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,210
- Dude, that's awesome.
Like, honestly, I swear to God,

91
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,455
I love this already.

92
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,836
- Oh...

93
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,219
- You got to admit, that's cool.

94
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,513
- It's a sore subject.

95
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,966
- Do you play

96
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,766
with other people, or are you just going

97
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,350
in a circle by yourself? Like...

98
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,146
- He spends money on trips to tracks.
- Yeah, let me see that.

99
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,400
Trips to tracks.
That sounds like a good website.

100
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,396
So when you have this money,

101
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,737
because clearly you have this money
to buy things like this,

102
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,123
why haven't you made a payment?

103
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,240
- I just feel like
I don't owe it to her because

104
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,287
we spent the money
that we got from the loan

105
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,250
on rent and bills for the house
that we were both living at.

106
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,172
- He spent it on his part of our bill.

107
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,040
- But, like, all our money's
been shared the whole,

108
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,627
the whole time we've been together, so...

109
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:14,882
- All of my money.

110
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,343
- What have you paid for,

111
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,133
in the grand scheme of your relationship?

112
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,087
-Nothing money-wise, but...

113
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,763
- James!

114
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,682
If this case didn't exist

115
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,347
right now at all, tomorrow morning,

116
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,476
are you s-- are you looking back

117
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:35,033
at having some sort of payment plan
or being able to do this?

118
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,494
- No.

119
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:45,163
- I'm trying to help you out here.

120
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,211
I've spoken to so many people
that have been incarcerated

121
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,922
and have been
in that position of-of having

122
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,383
to figure out life after,
and it's not an easy thing to do.

123
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,625
- Yeah.
- And I don't want you to think

124
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,636
you're alone in that feeling.

125
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,218
But ultimately,
my judgment goes to the plaintiff.

126
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,385
Cassie, for $2,500.

127
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,234
If you can, please let him
set up a payment plan

128
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,520
so he doesn't feel like he is struggling

129
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,113
immediately from the beginning.

130
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,319
Court is dismissed.
Thank you guys so much.

131
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,319
Can you leave the car, please?

132
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,946
- Can we play with it?
- No. Leave the car.

133
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:29,043
- I love him. He just needs
to start being responsible.

134
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,831
- Toy cars is my hobby,
and I love to travel around

135
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:35,785
and meet new people and be able
to go to new tracks and stuff.
