00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:02,423
Today on Chrissy's Court,

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:07,013
Stormie Lolles is suing her ex-lover,
Italia Roberts, for the cost of a camera

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,220
that was broken
during a physical altercation

4
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,141
after a date at Six Flags.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,680
Italia claims that their relationship
was an emotional roller coaster,

6
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,885
so they both share the blame.

7
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:20,265
The people are real, the cases are real,

8
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,654
and the judgments are legally binding,

9
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,571
no matter how unqualified the judge is.

10
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,991
- This is Chrissy's Court.

11
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:37,117
- All rise for the Honorable
Judge Chrissy Teigen.

12
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,754
- Killing it.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,330
- I know.
- Amazing job.

14
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,625
Hello, everybody.

15
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,378
You may be seated.

16
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,500
Stormie v. Italia.

17
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,667
Stormie, go ahead and explain your case.

18
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,837
- I am suing for $280

19
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,046
for the value of my camera
that Italia broke.

20
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,386
- How did you meet?
- I met her off of POF.

21
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,642
- Oh, Plenty of Fish. Okay.
- Plenty of Fish, yes.

22
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,813
- Mom is on there as well.

23
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,852
If anyone is interested.

24
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:04,056
How long were you talking
on Plenty of Fish?

25
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,147
- So, we started talking in January.
We didn't stop talking till March,

26
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,033
'cause in March, that's when I got
arrested with her and went to jail.

27
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,991
- So, just two months in, you...
you were in jail.

28
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,492
- Yeah. Two months in...
- The both of you?

29
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,334
- ...we were in jail, the both of us.
- Okay. So tell me

30
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,989
about this Six Flags incident.

31
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,367
- So, we got to Six Flags.

32
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,713
And then we literally get
in a verbal argument

33
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,959
on which way the ride for the swing was.

34
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,092
- We actually have a map,
a complete map of the Six Flags.

35
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,010
Italia, if you'd like to come to the map,
I would love to see

36
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,629
the trail that you went on.

37
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:35,046
- So, she starts going in that direction,
and I told her, "Stormie, the direction

38
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:38,467
to the entrance is in this direction,
going this way."

39
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:42,347
Um, and then, at that point in time,
she [bleep] just go...

40
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:46,766
...starts going crazy and is like,
"You stupid-ass [bleep]."

41
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,687
And I'm like, "What are you tripping on?"

42
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,735
- Okay. So she's going in
the complete opposite direction.

43
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,109
- Right.
- How did I go the wrong way

44
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:53,816
when I made it to the swing first?

45
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,406
Because I stopped.
I didn't [bleep] follow you.

46
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,741
Dumbass. You're dumb.
- You-you...

47
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,746
- Sometimes these relationships
are passionate

48
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,658
when they're...
when you have these fights, right?

49
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,167
And did you kind of get off
on that a little bit?

50
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,789
- She liked to fight as [bleep].
I don't know.

51
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:06,786
So, either way.
- What?

52
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,047
- You ride the swings.

53
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,418
Immediately after, what happens?

54
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:10,955
You guys are going back to the car.

55
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,008
You're over it. You're done.

56
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,760
- And then, on the way home,
we get in another big argument.

57
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,053
She's like, "You're just
a huffy little bitch.

58
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,466
Da-da-da-da-da. Get the [bleep]
out of my car. Da-da."

59
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,555
- I told her to get out of the car,
because she was just,

60
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,771
like, yelling at me.
- I'm like,

61
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,640
"Bitch, I ain't getting
the [bleep] out of shit."

62
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:24,847
And so she was like, "Yes,

63
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,727
you [bleep] are. Yes, you are."
So she-she comes

64
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,733
all the way in my face, right?
And I nibble on her cheek.

65
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,185
And then we start swinging.
She starts swinging on me.

66
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,235
- You nibble on my cheek?

67
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,608
- Yep, I sure did nibble on your cheek.

68
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,824
- You practically bit
my [bleep] cheek off.

69
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,164
- I sure did nibble on your cheek.

70
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,779
- You are [bleep]...
- Order.

71
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:37,945
Okay.

72
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:38,953
- She just has to do something...

73
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,414
- Yeah.
- ...every once in a while.

74
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:44,414
She's getting paid to do this, so,
every once in a while, she yells out.

75
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:48,668
Can you nibble on my mom's cheek
in the way that you think you nibbled

76
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,212
on her cheek?
- Yeah.

77
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,625
- Mom, honestly, I want to know,
like, if this is an accurate

78
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,684
portrayal of the nibble.
- Do you really want me to...

79
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:55,758
- Yeah, we don't care.

80
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,433
- Okay.

81
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,391
- Ooh.
- I did that.

82
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,351
- That-that was not how she did it,

83
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,851
because I had puncture...
I had punctures.

84
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,893
- It was punctures
'cause I socked yo' ass.
- No, you...

85
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:05,977
- Stop playing.
- No, you're [bleep]

86
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,351
dump as [bleep].
You [bleep] dumb.

87
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,687
- Order.

88
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,362
Talk to the judge!
- Order, order.

89
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,900
Yes. Good job, Mom.

90
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:16,114
Okay, so that, in no way,
was an accurate portrayal of the nibble.

91
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,486
After the nibble of the cheek...

92
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,334
- That's when she, um, swung on me.

93
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,699
- No, I did not touch her at all.

94
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,115
- You-you didn't swing at me?
- Not one [bleep] time.

95
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,123
Okay!
- That's why

96
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,714
I broke your [bleep] camera,
and that's why we're here,

97
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,710
'cause I didn't touch you.
-Literally. She snatched,

98
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,711
'cause I had a wig on.

99
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,092
- Yeah, your fake-ass hair.

100
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,379
Fake-ass hair. Take it off.

101
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,011
- I had a pretty, long wig on.
- Ugly-ass. Ugly-ass.

102
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,548
- She hated that I looked so good in it.

103
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,801
- She snatched it off. She was like...
- What?

104
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,433
- ..."You ugly little bitch.
You little..."

105
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,299
- No, she came over, and she jumped
over the center console,

106
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,967
and we both fall out of my truck together.

107
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,886
I fall out on my back.
She falls out on top of me.

108
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,516
- I fall on top of her?

109
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:48,903
- And she's just whaling on me.

110
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,019
- Yeah, I'm beating the [bleep]
out of you.

111
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,145
- After she got up off of me,

112
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,032
I grabbed her camera
and just slammed it against the wall.

113
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,650
- So, the cops were called,

114
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,407
and you both get arrested.
- At first,

115
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,118
they were only going to arrest me.

116
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,529
And, at that point, I said,
"Why am I getting arrested

117
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,538
when I'm the one..."
I said, "Look at my face.

118
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,370
Look at my..."
You know, I had bruises.

119
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,455
I had her teeth marks in my cheek.
- No, you didn't.

120
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,291
- Yes, I [bleep] did. How do you...
How are you gonna know?
- Which-which side? Which side?

121
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,706
- You were hella far from me.
- Which side?

122
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,054
Which side did I bite you?
- Shut up. My...

123
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,379
My left side.
- You're [bleep] lying.

124
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,514
- My left side. My left side.

125
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,760
- I bit you right here,
you dumb-ass bitch.

126
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,431
- You bit my mom
on the left side of her face.

127
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,510
- ...which side, you dumb bitch.
- I bit you like that, you dumb-ass ho.

128
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,675
- Okay, stop being dumb-ass hos.

129
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,104
Um... I'm just kidding.

130
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,643
I just never get to say that, ever.

131
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,596
I feel like my whole heart hurts

132
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,226
just from saying it out loud
that one time.

133
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,073
Um, but I do want to go to Six Flags now.

134
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,608
Okay, so only you're going to jail.

135
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,202
And then what happened?
They saw your face. They saw...

136
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,908
- And then they finally
arrested her after.

137
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:40,908
- You were in jail for three days.

138
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:41,949
- Mm-hmm.
- I got bailed out.

139
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,242
My mama came to bail me out.
- The same day?

140
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,366
- The same day, I got...
I was in jail for six hours.

141
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,123
- You don't know that she's
bailed out that same night.

142
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,825
- Mm-mm.
- You go three days in jail.

143
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:50,825
- Mm-hmm.

144
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,126
- Did you not want to ask anybody,

145
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,459
or just nobody could or...?
- No.

146
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,004
My mother was going to bail me out.

147
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,707
- How much was the bail, if I may ask?

148
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,507
- My bail was at $10,000, I think.

149
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,970
- Oh, my God!
- I told my mother.

150
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,260
She goes, "Do you want me to do it?
I can do it."

151
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,604
I said, "No, don't worry about it."

152
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:07,719
- You ended up losing your job
because of the time you were in jail.

153
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,558
So what happened?

154
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,725
- Take your time.

155
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,355
It's okay.

156
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,111
You're not buying this?

157
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,403
- I'm not buying shit.

158
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,066
- She's upset.

159
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,494
- It's just stupid,
'cause she's so [bleep] twisted.

160
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:24,664
- I'm twisted?

161
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,871
- And it's like the shit
that she says is, like...

162
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,702
You know, it's crazy. And she...

163
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,117
She's the type who--
she lives her whole life,

164
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,536
you know, having people pay for her shit.

165
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,745
- Mm-hmm.
- You know?

166
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,835
She doesn't know
how it is to be independent,

167
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,460
how to only count on yourself.

168
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,507
- Yeah.
- And to have nobody there, you know...

169
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,222
- You're 35 years old. Get a grip.

170
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,432
- My age has nothing to do
with what I'm talking about.
- It does.

171
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,062
It does. It does.
- And, obviously, you know...

172
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,269
Whatever.
- Whew. I'm really glad
you two are not together.

173
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,099
Yeah, I mean, the fact
that you both went to jail

174
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:54,225
means the police thought you were
both guilty of something, so...

175
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,397
My first gut was that, obviously, like,

176
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,817
you deserve this money
for this camera, but...

177
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,367
I think, like, there... Uh-uh.
- No. Oh. Oh.

178
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,991
- Uh, uh. Hold on.
- Oh, my God.

179
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,827
- I feel like there is
emotional distress that goes into

180
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,334
going to jail for three days.

181
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,165
And you guys did this together.

182
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,840
So, my ruling, I'm gonna do
a case dismissed here, um, and...

183
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,131
- Can I say something to her?
- Thank you.
- Yes.

184
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,094
- Can I hug you?
- Yes.

185
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,554
- 'Cause this is... this is closure to me.
- Aw.

186
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,014
- This would be incredible to me.
- This is closure to me.

187
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,353
And I've been wanting
to get this out of the way

188
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,308
for a long time,
even if I won or if I didn't win.

189
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,308
I just really wanted
to get this out of the way.
- Ah.

190
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,440
- So, can I hug you?
- Yes.

191
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,519
- Oh, Lord. Thank you, guys, so much.

192
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:39,194
- I'm sorry, Italia.

193
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,864
- It's all good. It's all good, babe.

194
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:42,994
- Are you gonna get back together now?

195
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,911
- Ugh. 'Cause, honestly, I swear,

196
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,119
this is the first case
where I would've went back there

197
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,660
and I would've...
Honestly, like, my heart hurts.

198
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,373
I hope you guys never have to
act this way with other people.

199
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,504
So... court is adjourned.

200
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,121
Um, thank you, guys, so much.
- It's cool.
- Thank you.

201
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,918
- You may leave.

202
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,921
- Ooh.

203
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,173
- I have closure, and I feel better,

204
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:05,586
even though I didn't get
my camera or my money for it.

205
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:10,006
I absolutely stand-stand by
my decision to break her camera.
