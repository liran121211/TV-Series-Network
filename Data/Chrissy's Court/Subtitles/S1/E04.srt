00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:02,133
Today on Chrissy's Court,

2
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:04,761
John Walker is suing
his friend Fred Fields

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:08,088
for an unpaid loan
that started in a Sizzler.

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:12,925
Fred says, "Sizzler?
He doesn't even know her!"

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,063
The people are real, the cases are real

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,771
and the judgments are legally binding,

7
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,652
no matter how unqualified the judge is.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,070
- This is Chrissy's Court.

9
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,448
- All rise for the Honorable

10
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,621
Judge Chrissy Teigen.

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,990
- Hello, everybody.

12
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,197
- There she is.

13
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,616
- Hello, Mom.
- Hi.

14
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,334
- All right.
You guys may be seated.

15
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,714
Today we have John Walker v. Fred Fields.

16
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:45,552
I know a little bit about your case,
but please, go ahead

17
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,969
and present it to all of us
in the courtroom here.

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,219
- In 2018, I came into
some retirement money,

19
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,972
and so Fred and I, we were
having lunch at Sizzler.

20
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,766
- Oh, my-- How often
do I talk about Sizzler?

21
00:00:58,851 --> 00:00:59,891
- He mentioned

22
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,437
that times were tough and how

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,230
he didn't have a lot of money at the time.

24
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,983
When he said that, I said,
"Well, you know,

25
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,435
"that-that ain't right.

26
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,985
My friend shouldn't be broke."
- Aw.

27
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,279
- So I reached in my pocket
and I pulled out $1,000.

28
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,034
And I handed him $1,000 and...

29
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,326
- You had $1,000 in your pocket
at Sizzler?

30
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,740
- I had about...

31
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,578
I had about $8,000, actually.
- Damn!

32
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,134
I think you can buy
an entire Sizzler for that.

33
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,588
- Oh, yes. Yes, yes.

34
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,088
- Wow. That is very

35
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,800
generous and kind of you.

36
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,090
- And I told him pay me back
whenever you get a chance.

37
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,304
And so he's never paid me back.

38
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,304
- Fred.

39
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,635
What's your defense here?

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,060
- When John gave me the $1,000,

41
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:40,559
he did it out of the kindness of
his heart; I didn't ask for it.

42
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:45,192
He told me I could pay the money
back when I make it big,

43
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,612
which I have yet to do.

44
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,030
- Make it big how?
- With my music career.

45
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,239
- Okay.
- I'm not small, but I'm not big.

46
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,570
I consider myself "medium."

47
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,615
- A comedian?
- No. "Medium."

48
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,659
- Medium.
- Oh, a medium.

49
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,122
I thought you were a comedium.

50
00:01:58,202 --> 00:01:59,912
- Nah.
- And I was like, "Oh, shit,

51
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:03,865
you do music and comedy,"
which seems awesome as well.

52
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,707
- And so, I think that's
an important stipulation.

53
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,752
- How long have you been
in the music industry?

54
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,586
- In 1989, I had my first record
in the stores.

55
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,973
- Wow.
- Then I came out here in '92.

56
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,761
I got with Walt Disney,
I did some songs

57
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,054
for The Mickey Mouse Club.

58
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,717
Then I hooked up with Death Row,

59
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,595
and one of my teachers is Dr. Dre.

60
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,062
While I'm over there with Dr. Dre,

61
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,692
it looks like something is finna happen.

62
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,019
- Honestly, I don't know
a lot about music,

63
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,614
but I do want to call out
our expert witness

64
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,530
to maybe be able to help us out
with this case.

65
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,242
Ladies and gentlemen, it's John Legend.

66
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,531
John is obviously a judge on The Voice.

67
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,414
He also has an EGOT.

68
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,491
Is there anything else
you want me to say about you?

69
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,576
- I'm happily married...
- Yes.

70
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,082
- ...Your Honor.

71
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,714
- You heard the case, right?
- You went from Disney to Death Row?

72
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,252
That is an incredible trajectory.

73
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,835
Not to be ageist,

74
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54,421
but rap tends to be
a young man's game.

75
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,048
I don't know how old you are, but...

76
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,224
if you were making music in 1989...

77
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,933
- John, he's 19 years old.
- Oh.

78
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,814
- Age don't count in the booth
when your flow

79
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,941
stays submerged
in the Fountain of Youth.

80
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,358
- Okay. Okay.
- Ruling is in... Sorry.

81
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,107
- Uh, I'm not doubting

82
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,151
that you're talented.

83
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,614
Perhaps you can make it more as a writer

84
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,945
or b-behind-the-scenes kind of person.

85
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,699
- That's where the money is, anyway.

86
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,281
- Well, it's in all of it, but
that's a way to make money...

87
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,867
- In our prenup,
you told me it was mostly...
- Oh, well...

88
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,503
- Your Honor...

89
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,160
- She crazy.

90
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,378
- The crux of the matter
for him, how do you define him

91
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,789
making it big,
or how do you define him

92
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,208
being able to pay you back?

93
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,626
- The problem is, I don't
remember that stipulation.

94
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,625
- I don't think he's taking
into consideration

95
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,467
the barbecues that I threw

96
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,802
and how he used to be able
to eat unlimited, free.

97
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,598
I used to do them every month.

98
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,061
I'm talking about premium...
- So you went

99
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,931
to Sizzler and then
you also held sizzlers.

100
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,558
- Oh, I get busy
with the culinary arts, now.

101
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,805
- Okay.
- You know what I'm saying?

102
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:50,937
I'm dangerous in the kitchen.

103
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,113
I even brought some to prove it to you.

104
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,652
- Well, maybe that should be your dream.

105
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,945
- Here, Judge.
- Oh, my gosh! Yes.

106
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,990
- Let me get in on this. Yes, please.
- John, you want to come up?

107
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,243
- So you want to talk about the money

108
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,405
and how your food ain't free...

109
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,453
- Mm-hmm.
- What do you think those Lakers

110
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,077
and Dodgers tickets cost me?

111
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,794
- That is good.
- That is really good.

112
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,174
- Did you have a good time?

113
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,960
Did I ask you for a dime?
- Judge?

114
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,424
Don't forget about Pepper.

115
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,674
- How'd you like your seat?
You told me it was sweet.

116
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,546
- Are you rapping right now?

117
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,973
- Okay.
- Yeah.
- He's rapping. He's rapping.

118
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,432
- Okay.
- We get to eat and listen to rap.

119
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,512
- What about your seat?
You told me it was sweet.

120
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,597
- When your ass needed cash,
I gave it to you in a flash.

121
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,693
- Oh!
- You got $1,000.

122
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,229
You didn't even need to holla.

123
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,902
So you want to talk about money again?

124
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,861
For 15 years, I've been your friend.

125
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,322
- Ooh...!

126
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,616
- Boy!

127
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,908
- Okay, so-so he want
to play like that, right?

128
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,962
I got the rib eyes,
the carne asada, plus filets.

129
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,078
I can do this all day
in all types of ways.

130
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,206
Man, please, my macaroni and cheese?

131
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,133
One bite, it'll have you
down on your knees.

132
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,303
Plus, I got the greens
and the barbecue beans.

133
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,013
The way I do my thing, man, ya boy mean.

134
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,974
If you caught that, you can roll with me.

135
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,644
'Cause in the hood, I'm Chef Boyar-G.

136
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,393
If you don't get a taste...
- Oh!

137
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,555
- ...then homie, you lost.

138
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,813
And you gonna know I'm a boss

139
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,484
when you taste my sauce.

140
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,193
Please excuse my French,
may I approach the bench?

141
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,694
You can adjust your face
and I rest my case.

142
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,696
- Oh!

143
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,320
- Okay!

144
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,374
- Legendary.
- First of all,

145
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,912
no one's ever fed me on the bench before,

146
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,536
and I feel so good now,
I'm also so-- super tired.

147
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,963
- She got the itis.
You gave her the itis, man.

148
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,592
Congratulations.

149
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,009
- I think...

150
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,974
Your food is legit good. Like...

151
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,513
- Well, thank you.
- ...it's actually delicious.

152
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,097
If you were to ever do a company

153
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,182
where you wanted a food truck
or a restaurant,

154
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,227
I would love to be a part of that.

155
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,771
- I appreciate that.

156
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,694
- But you know you owe John $1,000.

157
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,442
Ruling is in favor
of the plaintiff for $1,000.

158
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,105
Thank you so much.
Thank you for the food.

159
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,784
Absolutely beautiful.
- I'm gonna eat some more.

160
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:02,862
- Oh, we got corn bread, too,

161
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:03,856
I didn't even see.

162
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:04,867
- Oh, Lord.
- This is so good.

163
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,828
- Right. I need to get some.

164
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,699
- He loaned it to me,
I got to give it back.

165
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,905
That's what it is.

166
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:13,705
- Like Charlie Sheen said, "Winning."
