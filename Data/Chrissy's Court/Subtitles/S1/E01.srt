1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:02,093
Today on Chrissy's Court,

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,339
lounge singer Joey Valenza is suing

3
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,341
David Oganesyan for the cost of a speaker

4
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,053
that was damaged when David

5
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,843
startled Joey
with an outlandish song request.

6
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,058
David says it was Joey
that knocked the speaker over,

7
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,308
so...

8
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,771
The people are real.

9
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,771
The cases are real.

10
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,063
And the judgments are legally binding,

11
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,977
no matter how unqualified the judge is.

12
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,437
- This is Chrissy's Court.

13
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,827
- All rise

14
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:37,829
to the Judge--
Honorable Judge Chrissy Teigen.

15
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,673
- Oh, are we using that?

16
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:41,789
- Yeah.
- "For the Judge

17
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,955
Honorable Chrissy Teigen." Okay.

18
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,335
Hello, everybody!
- Hi.

19
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,342
- Joey v. David.

20
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,434
Joey, you look so familiar.

21
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,799
- I have a generic face.
- No! You don't have

22
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,846
a generic face.
- I do.

23
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,639
I had a nose job, but it grew back.

24
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,062
- Did we date?
I think we might have dated.

25
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,061
Joey, present me your case.

26
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,904
- I was singing in a restaurant.

27
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,650
Uh, I just finished a Sinatra song.

28
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,652
I was walking back to the stage,

29
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,824
and I heard a voice behind me say...

30
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,323
"Hey, you do any rap songs?"

31
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,025
- Wait, how did he say it?

32
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,735
"Hey, you do any rap songs?"
- Yeah. "Hey, you.

33
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,025
You sing any rap songs?"

34
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:17,038
I turned around.

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,409
It was a nice-looking young kid.
I said,

36
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,615
"Uh, this room isn't right for rap.

37
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,166
Sorry about it."

38
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,499
And the look on his face scared me.

39
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,344
I went back, and my shoulder hit
the-the speaker.

40
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,090
And fell off the table.

41
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,842
So I'm suing David
for the value of my speaker,

42
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,264
which is approximately $999.

43
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,393
- So, David, your defense.

44
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,720
- So, I walked into the restaurant.

45
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,215
I ordered some takeout.

46
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,227
Uh, decided to listen to some music.

47
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,479
I saw he was singing good songs, you know?

48
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,481
- Yeah.
- Like, you know,

49
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,402
I just wanted to hear my own style,

50
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,730
maybe joke around...
- What song did you want

51
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,315
to hear?
- A rap song.

52
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,780
I mean, do you look at him

53
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,610
and do you think that he knows a rap song?

54
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:53,606
- I mean...

55
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,027
- I mean, like, were you drinking

56
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,275
a little bit?
- No.

57
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,616
- No, not at all. No.
- No? Okay.

58
00:01:58,702 --> 00:01:59,952
Well, that's not helping your case.

59
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,247
You should've said you were drinking.

60
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,410
Um, okay.

61
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,747
- He got worked up, and, uh,

62
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,042
he backed up into his speaker,

63
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,586
knocked it down,
and he broke his own speaker.

64
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,420
So I don't owe him anything.
- We actually have an expert

65
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,926
in music, and he's gonna
come out and help me out.

66
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,088
So come on out.

67
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:22,635
Thank you.
So, John is actually a professional judge.

68
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:23,636
- I'm actually a coach.

69
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:24,687
I'm not a judge.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

70
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,060
You're a coach. That's right.

71
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,936
- But I do judge people.

72
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,573
- So, can we hear a little bit
of music from you?

73
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,531
- Now, I don't know if it's go--
It's working.
- Oh.

74
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,781
- Now it works.
- That sounds good.

75
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,492
- So it's not even-- it's not even broken.

76
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,662
- It works perfectly.
- It won't work

77
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,490
for half hour, an hour.

78
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,785
But you never know.

79
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,828
- I want you to sing for me,

80
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:41,831
and I'll know if the speaker's working.

81
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,843
- Can I have one thing to myself ever?

82
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,842
I just want to dance with you.

83
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,508
- Wait, you're singing that type of song,

84
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,267
and then David walks up to you
and says, "Hey!

85
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,480
Can you...?"
- "Play some Dr. Dre!"

86
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,060
- "Can you play some Dre?"
- Exactly.

87
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,444
- Okay, John, can you go ask him

88
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,481
to perform a so-- a rap song?

89
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:10,725
John will approach you...
- Yeah...

90
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,106
- Let's get the mic for you.

91
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,192
- ...and apparently scare
the shit out of you.

92
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,948
- Look at me. I'm scary.

93
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,041
Excuse me, sir.

94
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,328
Could I hear some rap music?

95
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,674
- I'm sorry.

96
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,378
This room is con--
not conducive to rap music.

97
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,959
But I can tell you
how they got the word "rap."

98
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,955
They took the "C" out of "crap."
- What?!

99
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,917
- And I hit the speaker.

100
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,468
- Right, right, right. Automatically.

101
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,762
- It's not funny, Judge.

102
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,141
It's not funny.

103
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,063
- David, is that how it happened?

104
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,142
- That's not. I can reenact it.
- Okay, David,

105
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,437
please approach.
Can you do it in the way that you think

106
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,191
that it happened?
- Yeah.

107
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,153
- Okay.
- John, you sing "My Way."

108
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,154
- Okay.

109
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,617
Thank you, everybody!

110
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,456
- Very nice. That was very nice.
- Thank you.

111
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,251
- That was very good. Can--
Do you have some rap music?

112
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:13,546
Maybe you could twist it...

113
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,509
- Don't do it again, please.

114
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,465
That's exactly how he did it.
- That's exactly...

115
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,975
- Wow. So, I mean, either way,
that was terrifying.

116
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,270
Uh...

117
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,603
- That's right.

118
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,530
- John, how do you feel as an artist

119
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:38,358
if, uh, anyone approaches you
to sing something different?

120
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,275
- Yeah. Well, I just think

121
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,454
the audience has a responsibility

122
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,083
to request responsibly,

123
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,660
if you know what I mean.
- Yes.

124
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,405
- So he shouldn't have asked you to rap,

125
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,617
especially he's a takeout customer.

126
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,537
Like, how does a takeout customer
get to request songs?

127
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,087
- Okay, so,

128
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,051
I mean, you backed up to your
own [bleep] speaker, Joey.

129
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,472
Um...

130
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,230
I mean, David, just know

131
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,060
that you don't go up to an entertainer
in a restaurant

132
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,607
and ask for rap music.

133
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:19,281
I'm gonna go ahead and rule
in favor of Joey for $999

134
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,531
for the speaker.

135
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,072
- Wow.

136
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,905
- But I'm gonna cover it.

137
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,412
'Cause I love you both.

138
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,663
Joey, you get a new speaker.

139
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,801
- One breath, John.

140
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,928
- Good job, Mommy.
- Thank you.

141
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,274
- What did you say, Luna?
- "Good job, Mommy."

142
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,019
- Oh, thank you, baby girl.

143
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,102
- Next time I want to request
a song, I'll ta--

144
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,768
definitely take a extra look
on the performer.

145
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,687
- Justice Christy-- Chrissy Teigen,

146
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,526
uh, did the right thing.

147
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,282
Thank you very much, everybody.
