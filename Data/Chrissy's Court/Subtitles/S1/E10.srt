1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:02,463
Today on Chrissy's Court...

2
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:04,634
Gracie Wilks is suing roommate

3
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:07,133
Cassie Ledbetter for driving her new car

4
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:10,046
1,800 miles to a Phish concert.

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,755
Cassie says Gracie would've done
the same thing if she

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,426
were in her boat and thinks

7
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,555
that she should be let off the hook.

8
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:17,982
The people are real,

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,980
the cases are real,

10
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,362
and the judgements are legally binding

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,229
no matter how unqualified the judge is.

12
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,777
- This is Chrissy's Court.

13
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,994
- All rise for the Honorable

14
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,247
Judge Chrissy Teigen.

15
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,329
- Good morning, everybody.

16
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,214
- Here she is.
- Good morning.

17
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,671
Gracie...

18
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,751
so, you are suing for $542.

19
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,008
You guys are both 20 years old.

20
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:48,259
You're so young.

21
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,470
Baby's first lawsuit.

22
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,052
So, why don't we go ahead
and start with you?

23
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,177
- Okay, so,
Cassie's car was having some problems,

24
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,056
so I let her borrow mine, um,

25
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,732
just to run errands around
the town for the weekend,

26
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,362
um, while I was staying with my boyfriend.

27
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,108
But when I got back, um,

28
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,860
I realized that there was over 1,800 miles

29
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,653
on my brand new car.

30
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,526
Um, yeah, found out that
Cassie actually drove my car

31
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,534
to Maryland without telling me

32
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,326
for a Phish concert from Alabama.

33
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,870
- So, it's, it was a brand-new car?
- Brand-new car.

34
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,083
I had literally gotten it, like,
a month before.

35
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,623
Brand-new car.
- Okay, I was like, "Holy crap,

36
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,037
I would never notice
something like that ever.

37
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,785
- No, no, no, no, no.
Here's the funny part

38
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,337
is I never would've known anything

39
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,511
if I didn't get a speeding ticket
in the mail,

40
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,970
like, six weeks later

41
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,759
that Cassie got on the way to Maryland.

42
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,723
I didn't even know that I got it,
okay, in my defense.

43
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,684
- Okay.
- It was like one of those pictures...

44
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,095
- Oh, the flasher ones, okay.
- Exactly.

45
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,394
- The ticket is $42

46
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,436
and the 500 is the wear and tear.

47
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,570
- $42 for a speeding ticket?
Oh, my-- that's like--

48
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,398
How much is it here? It's, like, $500.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,243
Plus, you get dings on your insurance--
that's, it's--

50
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,320
that's crazy.
- Your nanny got it all the time.

51
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,945
- Our nannies get them often.

52
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,452
I don't drive, 'cause

53
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,953
I'm me.

54
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,706
Cassie, now you are free
to tell your side.

55
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,168
- She loaned me her car.

56
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,248
She didn't give me any stipulations

57
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,094
of like, "Oh, you can only drive
to work, you can only do this."

58
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:10,379
It was like, "Here's my car.
Use it while you need it."

59
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,344
A friend of mine who lives in Maryland

60
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,224
texted me the day before the concert.

61
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,551
And it's a 12-hour drive,

62
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:16,756
so I literally had to leave, like,

63
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,805
four hours after he texted me.

64
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,139
- I think you should be incredibly
grateful

65
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:21,814
this is only a $42 ticket.

66
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,562
That is bonkers-- we got to move.

67
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,654
- Yeah.
- But the thing is, like,

68
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,859
the reason why I don't feel like
I even owe her the $40,

69
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,440
me and Gracie live together

70
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:32,605
and her boyfriend eats all of our food.

71
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,614
Like, all of our food,
and that's been, like,

72
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,276
an ongoing dispute with us.

73
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:37,815
And so, when I owed her $40,

74
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,988
I was like, "Consider us even
for all the crap

75
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,117
that I paid for
for your boyfriend to eat."
- Yeah.

76
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:44,004
- Okay, um, who wipes up
all of your cat litter

77
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,621
that's all over the floor?
- Wait, so you both share,

78
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,837
you share a place,
your boyfriend lives there as well?

79
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:51,168
- No, he's just over plenty.
- He lives there right now.

80
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:52,705
- Well, Mom,
what are you thinking about this?

81
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,508
- You know what?

82
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,221
The Phish show, what is it?
- Oh, Phish.

83
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,103
- It's a band.
- I thought it was a fish!

84
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,140
What, you thought it was, like,
a fish show, like a dog show?

85
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,274
- Yeah.

86
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,061
- Also worth driving to Maryland for!

87
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,765
- It was a band she went to go see--
it's not a dog show.

88
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,146
- Oh, oh, oh, I thought...
- There are no fish shows.

89
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,823
- Oh, yeah, oh, okay, okay.

90
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,491
- So, yeah, okay, well, Mom gets it now.

91
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,570
Um, so this number of 500--

92
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,235
where does this come from to you?

93
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,623
Is this just a number you thought of?

94
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,540
- I looked up the book value of my car

95
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,828
and the damage that driving it that far

96
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,623
puts on my car--
that's the price value on it.

97
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,668
And, you know what, I'm not budging on it,

98
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,251
because I can't do it anymore.
- Here's the funny thing.

99
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,877
I looked up the book value,
and the difference is

100
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,125
$26 in value, not even close to 500.

101
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,887
- Ooh! Okay, so do you have evidence
you'd like to present?

102
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,560
- Yeah, let's go for it.
- I have evidence as well.

103
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,059
- Yay, can you grab it? She's like...
- Yes.

104
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,352
- She's got stuff to do!
- Evidence...

105
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,556
It's up there.

106
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,607
Wow, so you, Cassie,

107
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,071
you did your research,
and you actually found out

108
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,821
that the Blue Book Value

109
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,283
- For the amount of mileage
that I put on the car,

110
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,913
not even close to $500.

111
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,410
It's a $26 difference.

112
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,371
Honestly, I'd be willing to pay the $26,

113
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,373
plus the $40 ticket, like...

114
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,995
- So, would you accept the ticket price

115
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,001
plus the $26 as a settlement?
-No, I'd accept

116
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,213
the ticket price and $100. I need to get

117
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,054
an oil change anyways.
- 1,800 miles?

118
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,219
You know how frequently
you should get an oil change?

119
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,628
- How frequently should you
get an oil change?

120
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,926
Tell me, mechanic.

121
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,469
- What they say is every 3,000 miles.

122
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,932
- Oh, every 3,000 miles?
- But... yes.

123
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,892
Gracie, you are a terrible negotiator.

124
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,182
- Okay, you know how much
an oil change costs?

125
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,305
- $45?
- Okay, a hundred bucks.

126
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,142
- Sounded like Luna.
- So, let's say
an extra 20 bucks for that.

127
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,438
- Yeah, that's my daughter.
That's how Luna does it.

128
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,151
Oh, they're just going.
- Okay, you know

129
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,611
that I can't afford to pay you

130
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,360
that $500, Gracie.
- Okay, well,

131
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,822
I can't afford to have
to go and get my car fixed

132
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,573
when it breaks down because
you've driven it 2,000 miles!

133
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,195
- You drive your car long distances for

134
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,331
work all the time.
- Exactly, because it's for work!

135
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,328
- You guys, stop!
It's making me so sad, honestly!

136
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,660
- Talk to the judge, talk to the judge!

137
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,171
- Okay, what about
a payment plan of sorts?

138
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,591
- $142, or a payment plan, sure!
- Why don't...? Why haven't

139
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,170
you guys just communicated
about this, though, you live together,

140
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,086
you're good friends...?
- Because every time we try
to communicate on about it,

141
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,474
it's like this.
- It ends up like this.

142
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,141
-It's like this.
- It's us pointing fingers

143
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,929
and never getting anywhere.
- Just butting heads.

144
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,142
- So, we need you as
a moderator, please, help.
- Okay.

145
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,935
- You know what I really, really want?

146
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,232
- What?
- I want you, Cassie,

147
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,355
to pay $142 to Gracie.

148
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,073
And I want you to hug so badly.

149
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,783
- Aw!
- Is that okay?

150
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,824
Can we do that?

151
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,527
- Yay.
- I love you.

152
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,197
- Ruling goes to the both of you!

153
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,708
I'm gonna find you Phish tickets,

154
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,579
and I'm gonna get you Phish tickets.

155
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,166
- Yeah, you got to go together.

156
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,041
- And you can take my mom.
- Yes!

157
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,588
- Yay!
- We'll have a great time.

158
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,261
You'll love it.
- What is it?!

159
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,629
- Everybody wins here! Case adjourned.

160
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,087
- Let's go VIP!

161
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,717
- Bye-bye.

162
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,774
- Even though I have to pay $142,

163
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,689
I would definitely still have gone
to the Phish concert.

164
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,148
- I love Phish even more
after this whole experience,

165
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,729
and I'm actually really glad that Cassie

166
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,275
has gotten to see them, too, now.

167
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,608
- Let's go have a beer.

168
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,693
Thank you, guys!
- Court adjourned!

169
