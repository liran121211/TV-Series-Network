00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:01,923
Today on Chrissy's Court,

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,552
Derek Tran is suing
his boyfriend Daniel Falanga

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,550
for $70 for buying the wrong
gift for Daniel's cousin.

4
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:13,505
Daniel says this is typical Derek
and is over it.

5
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,637
The people are real, the cases are real,

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,265
and the judgments are legally binding,

7
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,943
no matter how unqualified the judge is.

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,652
- This is Chrissy's Court.

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,572
- All rise to the Honorable Judge

10
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:35,117
Chrissy Teigen.
- Hello, everybody.

11
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,622
- Hi, Judge.
- Hi, Mom.

12
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,294
You may be seated. All right.

13
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,293
Derek v. Daniel.

14
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,125
So you guys are in a relationship...

15
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,341
- As of today, yeah.

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,300
- Or it ends today?

17
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,341
- TBD.
- Okay, so,

18
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,934
Derek, go ahead and explain
your side of this case here.

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,260
- It was his cousin Katie's birthday.
- Mm-hmm.

20
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:57,676
- And we decided to go halfsies
on gifts together.

21
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:02,346
I wanted this really cute sweater
that says "that bitch" on the side.

22
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,397
Very cute. It would go well
with high-waisted pants.

23
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,982
Is this from the Lizzo song?
She loves that song?

24
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,027
Or is it...
- Yes, I sent him the link,

25
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,321
and then he told me that
he bought the sweater already.

26
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,985
- Okay.
- And then, cut to:

27
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,833
it's Katie's birthday.
- Uh-huh.

28
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,828
- And she sends us
this photo of a sweater,

29
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,871
and I thought it was the ugliest
sweater in the world.

30
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,166
- It did the job! She needed
a (bleep) birthday present.

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,790
I don't understand!

32
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:26,497
- Stop.

33
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,167
- I love you both already.

34
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,125
Okay, so, did she say, like,

35
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,125
"Oh, my God, I just got the
ugliest sweater in the world,"

36
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,427
or did you take a look at it and say,
"This is a really ugly sweater"?

37
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,812
- That's a very good question,
Your Honor.

38
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,019
- Thank you.
- Um...

39
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,886
- Ruling in favor for the defendant.

40
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,557
- Uh...

41
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,145
I knew that she was probably thinking

42
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,441
it was the ugliest sweater,
and I thought the same thing.

43
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,736
So now I'm suing him for $70,

44
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,530
which was half the total cost
of the entire gift.

45
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:55,815
- Okay, let me see this sweater.
- Okay.

46
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,528
- Mom, can you actually put it on, please?

47
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,738
- Sure.

48
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,747
It's really cute.

49
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,919
- Oh, that's it?
Just a sweatshirt, simple sweatshirt.

50
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,918
Put it on.
- I don't want to ruin my hair.

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,460
You have literally no other job here.

52
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,673
It's like all you do

53
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,674
is every once in a while
you get your line right

54
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,546
at the beginning,
and that's what you have to do.
- All right.

55
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,303
So it's just "that bitch."

56
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,394
- You know, it's simple.
It's not doing a lot.
- Yes.

57
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,560
- But it's doing enough.
- What do you think of it, Mom?

58
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,469
- Fit me perfectly.
- Actually, my mom

59
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,097
would wear this in a heartbeat.

60
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,274
You are that bitch, too, so...
- Yeah.

61
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,903
- It's a good fit.
Daniel, your side of the case.

62
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,860
- Okay, so I'm gonna fill in
the holes of the bullshit

63
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:30,901
that Derek just gave us.
- Okay.

64
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,074
- Derek said he was going
to get this sweater,

65
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,284
and then Derek has this talent
of just sitting on that forever.

66
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,487
- Uh-huh.
- And not taking initiative.

67
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,787
- Okay, so,

68
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,250
you were waiting on him to buy it,
and by the time that you finally realized

69
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,252
he wasn't gonna get it,
you had to get something.
- Yeah.

70
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,094
- Yeah, you want to see it?
- Yes, I want to see the sweatshirt.

71
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,879
- If that's what you think
is so much nicer, we should've

72
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,303
gotten her a (bleep) gift card
at this point.

73
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,382
- More words!
- Chrissy.

74
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,927
- Shut up, Derek.
- Oh, you can just put it on over...

75
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,510
Hey! Guys.

76
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,925
Mom, can you read this to me?

77
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,313
- "My DNA test confirmed

78
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:06,481
I am 100% that bitch."

79
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,440
- That is a great sweatshirt, Derek.

80
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,734
Uh, you're gonna double up now?
- It-it's gonna be hot,

81
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,108
-sweetheart, don't...
- Yeah.

82
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,404
She'll get it.

83
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,487
Wait, so where do you both live?

84
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:17,612
- Culver City.
- Okay.

85
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,778
Amazing restaurants out there.

86
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,026
Have you been to Vespertine?

87
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,448
- No. That's...
- We don't have that much money.

88
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,406
- n/naka?
- No! We don't have

89
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,866
the kind of money you have!

90
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,537
- It's less than Vespertine!

91
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,335
- n/naka.
- Maybe that'll be my judgment,

92
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,799
is just I'll send you both
to n/naka and shut up about it.

93
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,378
Okay, this one's great, too.
I really understand,

94
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,296
there's differences in these sweatshirts.

95
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,095
- It's a bubble font.
- Mom, what do you think?

96
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,509
- Uh, I-I like the first one.

97
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:44,387
The small word.
- Yeah, you're just that bitch.

98
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,144
No, there was no DNA test
that confirmed it.

99
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,516
We have Katie, actually, on Skype live,
and we're gonna talk to Katie.

100
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:53,895
Katie is going to be giving us
the honest truth.

101
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,114
- Hi, Katie.
- Hi.

102
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,355
- When you received
the sweatshirt that says,

103
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:01,827
"My DNA test confirmed
I am 100% that bitch,"

104
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,539
you were like, "Thank you
so much for this sweatshirt."

105
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,460
- Of course.
- But you can be honest with us now.

106
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,328
Would you have preferred
to have this more simple

107
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,416
"that bitch" sweatshirt?

108
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:15,342
- I'm a big Lizzo fan,
and I think the sweatshirt I got

109
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,762
more outwardly displays my love of Lizzo.

110
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,431
- Oh, my goodness, Daniel.

111
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,141
Derek, she loves the one she got.

112
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,641
She can't say that she doesn't
in front of her cousin.

113
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,233
- She already said it, Derek.
- I will say,

114
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,349
I did bring it out at the bar
and showed it to people.

115
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,846
- So you wore it out.

116
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,058
- I didn't wear it.
It was in my bag.

117
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,317
- See? See? See?

118
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,978
- Do you want to see my mom in it?

119
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,987
- You look great.

120
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,239
- Here's what you
could have had, though.

121
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,661
- So I'm not giving it back, then.

122
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,029
- No. Take it off!

123
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,025
What the hell?
Who gets you dressed

124
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,407
in the morning?
- W-Watch-watch my hair.

125
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,575
Watch my hair and my ears.

126
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:51,004
- Okay, so this is what
you could have had.

127
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,543
- That's nice, too.
It's not showing my support

128
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,837
at the level that I need
to be displaying it, so...

129
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,211
- You're hearing this, Derek?

130
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,257
- Has she worn it once out
since she's got it?

131
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,262
- Yeah. You have a picture of me in it.

132
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,764
- Where did you wear it?
Was it in public,

133
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,176
or was it around the house?

134
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,604
- Oh, it was in my house.

135
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,732
- Chrissy...

136
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:19,355
- We have an expert celebrity witness.

137
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,494
- Oh, wow.
- And I would like

138
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,781
to put him up on the screen now.

139
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,453
- The DNA results are in,

140
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,865
and Katie is 100% that bitch.

141
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,711
- All in all, she's happy
with the gift she got, so case dismissed.

142
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:40,125
You guys may leave the courtroom.
Thank you so much.

143
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,425
- Come help me, Judge.

144
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,928
- Oh, God.

145
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,136
Okay, what do you guys think?
Let's get a round of applause.

146
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,601
Who would prefer "that bitch"?

147
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,516
Who would prefer the longer version?

148
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:03,701
- I still think that Katie
wasn't telling 100% of the truth,

149
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,160
which kind of biased Chrissy's decision.

150
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,162
- I pretty much crushed it.

151
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,914
I, uh, delivered what I needed to,
and I came out with the W,

152
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,917
which is all I wanted
to come here and do today.

153
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:14,999
- Chrissy, we have a surprise for you.

154
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,043
- What?

155
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,877
- I have one more DNA result.

156
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:22,092
Chrissy Teigen,
the DNA test determined

157
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:26,184
you are also 100% that bitch.

158
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,471
- Yes!
- Yeah!
