00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:02,213
Today on Chrissy's Court,

2
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:04,424
Monique Hooks is suing her sister

3
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07,045
Devon Hines for the cost
of Tupperware, shirts

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,682
and lighters Devon has stolen
over the years.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,180
Devon claims she's entitled
to whatever she wants

6
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:16,352
because she's the older sister
and it's her Devon right.

7
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,693
The people are real, the cases are real,

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,150
and the judgments are legally binding

9
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,151
no matter how unqualified the judge is.

10
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,574
- This is Chrissy's Court.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,660
- All rise

12
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,452
for the Honorable Judge
Chrissy Teigen.

13
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,697
- Hello!

14
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:38,708
- Hi, Judge.

15
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:39,789
- How are you, Yay?

16
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,713
- I'm good. How's yourself?

17
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,502
- I am feeling great, actually.

18
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,545
Thank you.

19
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:47,088
Been studying... law.

20
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,012
Oh, you may be seated.

21
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:53,971
Monique versus Devon,
suing for $171.97-- very specific--

22
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:58,234
for various things your sister
ate, stole, broke.

23
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,268
Wait, so you're both 30?
- Mm-hmm.

24
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,442
- How many months apart are you?

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,310
- She's 61 days older than me.

26
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,317
- Wow.
- And she likes to harp

27
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,649
on those 61 days, like they matter.

28
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,355
- They do matter.
- We're practically twins.

29
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,985
- Yeah, you are.
- But I'm still older.

30
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,122
- Okay, remember that.

31
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,449
- We've been best friends and sisters.

32
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,156
We found out we were sisters
in high school.

33
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,576
- You were best friends before you even
found out you were sisters?

34
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,245
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- Aw.

35
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,333
- That's amazing.

36
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,628
- Well, actually,
we were gonna fight first.

37
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:28,958
- Then we started to like each other.

38
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,417
- I love you both already.

39
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,467
How did you find out you were sisters?

40
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,301
- It was our sophomore year
of high school.

41
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,426
So, we had went through
a whole school year together.

42
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,063
And I've never been big on my father.

43
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,441
And then me and her
are having a conversation.

44
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,188
She was saying things that
really were kind of similar.

45
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,061
So, I was like, "Do you have a picture?"

46
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,108
And she pulls out the picture,
and I was like, "Wow."

47
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:51,532
- If I found out I had
a sister right now...
- You have a sister.

48
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,112
- I know I have a sister,
but if I found... like, if a...

49
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:57,028
if a new one existed out there,
I'd be so excited!

50
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,987
That's a big deal, you guys!
That's amazing.

51
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,077
- I was actually excited.
I grew up in a household

52
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:02,543
with boys, so I never had
a sister, so it was like,

53
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,753
"Yay, now I have a sister!
- So, Monique,

54
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,503
explain your case.

55
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,295
What are some of the things
that Devon has taken from you?

56
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,668
- She has stolen all my good Tupperware.

57
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,086
She doesn't even cook, um...

58
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,885
- What are you putting in this Tupperware?

59
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,048
- Her food from her house that I buy.

60
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,506
- Yeah, she steals my food.

61
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,137
Uh, she takes all my lighters.

62
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:21,564
- We lose a lot of lighters.

63
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,102
We won't say what
we're lighting up, but...

64
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,975
- It's for a barbecue.

65
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:25,982
- Our barbecue!

66
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,193
- Sure, barbecue.

67
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,822
- Yes!
- She's taken my shirts,

68
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,819
which you can look at her and look at me,
and tell they won't fit the same.

69
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:32,952
- Well, [bleep]

70
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,528
- I-I mean her... chest!

71
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,413
She made a video about
how I wasn't getting my Tupperware back.

72
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,624
- Can we see the video, please?

73
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,455
- Is this your Tupperware?

74
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,712
Is this your
Tupperware?

75
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,714
A real-ass bitch give a [bleep]
about your Tupperware?

76
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:55,127
Is this your Tupperware?
- I can listen to this all day.

77
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,887
- Is this your Tupperware?

78
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,929
A real-ass bitch give a [bleep]
about your Tupperware?

79
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,731
- And she got that piece by me being nice

80
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,269
and making cupcakes
for her daughter's birthday.

81
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,403
- I want to hear it one more time, please.

82
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,609
- Is this your Tupperware?

83
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,900
Is this your
Tupperware?

84
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,994
A real-ass bitch give a [bleep]
about your Tupperware?

85
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,816
- Uh, that is incredible.

86
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,616
So, you were teasing her
about the Tupperware?
- I was.

87
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,621
- You knew you were gonna
get under her skin.

88
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,083
What do you have to say for yourself?
- I don't feel bad.

89
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,333
- I think it's funny, personally.

90
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,165
- I thought it was hilarious.

91
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,380
- Really?
- So, Devon,

92
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,840
you have things that you've done...

93
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,380
- Mm-hmm.
- ...that-that you feel like

94
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,384
negate this entire situation.

95
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,546
- I have the list right here
of all the things

96
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,465
that I do for her.
- I don't want to hear this.

97
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,675
- This is a very short list.
You didn't need a whole piece of paper.

98
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,136
Okay, so, "When her phone was
broken and I had two phones,

99
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,686
I let her use one of my phones."

100
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,019
Why do you have so many phones?

101
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,614
- 'Cause she's a trap star.

102
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:54,189
- Oh! I don't even know what that means,
but it just sounds so cool.

103
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:57,356
- She got two phones--
one for the hoes and one for the pros.

104
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,907
- It be like that.

105
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,160
- Oh, that's one I don't understand.

106
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,992
- I mean, I'm sure John has,
like, five, but...

107
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,657
Tell me about these shorts and the shit.

108
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,748
What the [bleep] is this show?

109
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,254
Yes, tell me about
the shit on your shorts.

110
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:16,087
- Her dog pooped on my shorts,
so I feel like...

111
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,343
my shorts are gone, your shirts are gone.

112
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,545
- Is your dog notorious
for shitting on stuff?

113
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:21,926
- No.
- Okay. Okay.

114
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,602
- She drug her shorts and her clothes

115
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,770
out to the middle of the floor
and took a shit on the shorts.

116
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,772
- She's just sitting there laughing,
like, are you serious?

117
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,234
- You're an adult.
- Get your animal!

118
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,404
So, Monique, do you feel like

119
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,692
anything on this tiny list is valid?

120
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,146
The groceries...
- Just the groceries.

121
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:39,907
- The groceries are more
than you're suing for.

122
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,068
What is with this $171.97?

123
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,537
- That's 'cause I know how much
those Tupperware cost.

124
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,249
- I like it, 'cause it makes me feel like

125
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,959
you've thought about this,
even though I have no idea.

126
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,959
- Oh, yeah, every time I go
in Walmart and walk down

127
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,751
the Tupperware aisle, I'm like,
"I used to have this!"

128
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:55,245
- Okay.
- But you can come get them.

129
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,377
They're in the cabinets
with all the lids on them.

130
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,344
- Oh, when I tried to come
get them last time, you're like,

131
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,514
"Well, I have chicken in
that one, and that one has..."

132
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,853
- Okay, so, now, how far
do you live apart?

133
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,219
- Seven minutes.
- How far are you?

134
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,765
- Seven minutes?
- Yes.

135
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,429
- And you can't share
T-shirts and Tupperware?

136
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,648
- You see, you see what I'm saying!
- What can I do with a shirt

137
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,938
after she puts those boobs in it?

138
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,608
- In the Tupperware?

139
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,446
- You guys, these are sisterly benefits!

140
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,619
- I don't benefit from this sisterhood.
- Exactly.

141
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,708
- To me, looking from outside in,

142
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,342
it's incredible that
you two found each other.

143
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,759
It's a good thing you found
a family member for life.

144
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,009
But you can't just steal shit.
My ruling is actually

145
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,591
going to be, I'm going to give...

146
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,927
you both full sets of Tupperware.

147
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,433
And, also, Devon,
I'm gonna shit on your shorts.

148
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,104
- Verdict-- case dismissed.

149
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,607
And here is some Tupperware
for the both of you.

150
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,569
Yay!
- You both are fantastic, okay?

151
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,650
Get it together.

152
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:02,105
- Court adjourned!

153
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,406
- No, I don't give a [bleep]
about her new Tupperware,

154
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,529
and I'm probably gonna end up with
some of the new Tupperware as well.

155
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:10,118
- I'm gonna take her set
of Tupperware, too.

156
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,294
My Tupperware!

157
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,581
I'm so used to not having it.
