00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:02,423
Today on Chrissy's Court,

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:05,593
Cynthia Taylor is suing friend Gigi MoisÃ©

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,842
for impound fees and a key replacement,

4
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:10,005
after Gigi got Cynthia's car towed

5
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,513
and lost the key.

6
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:12,595
Gigi is countersuing

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,349
for unpaid cat-sitting fees

8
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,891
because, well, you'll find out.

9
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,595
The people are real.

10
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,395
The cases are real.

11
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,769
And the judgments are legally binding,

12
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,476
no matter how unqualified the judge is.

13
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,107
- This is Chrissy's Court.

14
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,744
- All rise...

15
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:37,405
to the Honorable Judge Chrissy Teigen.

16
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:38,826
- Hello, hello!

17
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,124
- Hi.
- Hello, Mother.

18
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,578
Ah, you may all be seated.

19
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:45,548
- They're our case of the day.

20
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,049
- Thank you.
Case of the day!

21
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,260
- Yeah.

22
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,880
- So, Cynthia?
- Yes.

23
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,177
- You are suing Gigi?

24
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,590
- Yep.

25
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,428
- Uh, Cynthia,
explain your case.

26
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,643
- Oh, yeah, I had
a family emergency.

27
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,313
And Gigi had offered
to check up on Smoogler,

28
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,903
my kitty.
- Can I see a picture of Smoogler?

29
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,269
- Yes, you may. Here.
- I don't know why,
but I just love animals.

30
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,936
Oh, Smoogies!

31
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:07,935
Super cute cat.

32
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,646
- Yeah, he's my baby.

33
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,486
- And, Gigi, your sole job
is a caretaker for animals?

34
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,073
- Yes. I do watch dogs.
- Okay.

35
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,617
- I love all animals,
you know what I'm saying?

36
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,451
- Okay, so, Cynthia, continue.

37
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,076
- In-in leaving so quickly,

38
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,752
'cause of an emergency in the family,

39
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,881
I forgot to get his treats for him.

40
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,208
- "Treats"?
- Yeah.

41
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,503
- So, Smoogler has specific treats

42
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,757
that Smoogler must have.
- Yes, he does treats--
dry food, wet food.

43
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,429
And he has, like, a water
fountain water bowl and...

44
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,718
- Okay, high maintenance.

45
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,892
- He's-- that's my baby.
- A running water bowl,

46
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,641
a running water bowl constantly running.

47
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,234
- I didn't even know cats
had to be taken care of,

48
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,019
so this is all new to me.
I thought you could just

49
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,772
leave a cat for, like, a week.
- Right.

50
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,484
- A month.
- Yeah. I mean, a year.

51
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:49,145
- He doesn't drink the water
if it's not running.

52
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,154
- Well, Smoogs has fine taste,
and I think we would all do that

53
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:54,066
if we had the option...
granted to us by Cynthia.

54
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,776
- Anyways, uh, so I told her
to take my car

55
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,617
and go to Petco and get
the treats for him.

56
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,452
And she took my car

57
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,787
and she ended up venturing off
to visit a friend,

58
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,254
and parked my car in a red zone.

59
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,535
It got impounded.

60
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,668
That cost me $678.20,

61
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,586
which I have the receipt for you.

62
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,514
- Yes, I would love to see the receipts.
- Okay, all right.

63
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,553
And then she lost my keys.

64
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,757
- Oh.

65
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,386
- My God! Okay.

66
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,773
Gigi, you are countersuing
for $1,400, the amount

67
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,811
Cynthia owes for watching the cat Smoogler

68
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,806
for seven days straight at $200 a day.

69
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,028
Holy shit. $200 a day?

70
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,778
- It's like a Beverly Hills cat.

71
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,200
- Well... I'm about to learn
a ton of shit, I think.

72
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,278
So, now I want to hear your side.

73
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,624
- I feel like I need to get paid.

74
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,328
My time is not for free.

75
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,948
Gigi, what do you typically charge?

76
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,865
Did you charge her less than
what you would charge a...

77
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,004
client?
- I have some receipts here,
you know, for the time

78
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,791
I had her cat and the cat food

79
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,344
and the cat box I had
to bring to my house.

80
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,798
- What is she talking about?
- I had to go to big measures

81
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,668
to get that cat in my house
and make the cat

82
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,085
feel comfortable.
- You took my cat to your house?

83
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,763
- Well, yeah, honey.

84
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,092
- Gigi, I asked you to go check
on my cat once a day.

85
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,097
- I should charge you for the bite marks.

86
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,519
- Oh, my God.
- Let me go through Gigi's fees here.

87
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,058
- Hello, hello.
- She says there's a one-time fee of $73.

88
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,102
- Hello.
- A $875 overnight fee.

89
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,567
- And she got a $25 discount.
She got lucky.

90
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,148
- You had to buy a cat box?
- Yeah,

91
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,363
it needs to litter somewhere.
- She wouldn't have to

92
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,612
if you hadn't taken him anywhere.

93
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,824
- And my house smells like litter.

94
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,113
I forgot to add the cleaning lady.

95
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,566
- Oh, God.
- How about that?

96
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,987
- Okay, what is this "break fee"?
- Um, my break fee.

97
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,576
- So, you get paid for working
and then also get paid

98
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,622
for not working?
- Yeah.

99
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,615
- Oh,

100
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,876
Mom's loving it, personally.

101
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,298
Okay, but, Gigi, you know

102
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,048
you know...
- What?

103
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,300
- You owe for this car
and the impound fees.

104
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,893
- I'm gonna say I didn't know
where I parked,

105
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,968
I lost the keys,
and I didn't know what happened.

106
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,513
And that was it.
- Wait, where did you go?

107
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,467
- I went to a friend's place and,

108
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,847
like, I got kind of wasted
and I lost my keys and my phone.

109
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,805
- Honestly, that happens
to me a few times a month.

110
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,306
- Tell me about it.

111
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,817
And when I came back, the car was gone.

112
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:52,939
How do I know she didn't have a copy,

113
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,565
she had her boyfriend take it,

114
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,821
and then just hid the car...
- Serious?

115
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,613
- and then charge me for this fee...?

116
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,446
- Yeah, there's no guessing game on this.

117
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,991
Like, we actually have
paperwork for it, so...
- Oh, okay.

118
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,735
It wasn't my fault
that the red zone was there.

119
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,197
I didn't know it was there.

120
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,997
- I mean, the impound
was your fault, though.

121
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,210
- You know, it could've been.

122
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,381
But I don't feel like it is!
- It was!

123
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,590
- I didn't see the red zone.

124
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,300
- "It could've been"!

125
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,220
- I didn't know where I parked, okay?

126
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,180
But, you know, I had a hard time
taking care of that cat,

127
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,350
so I actually had to borrow
some of her watches.

128
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,179
- Watches are also involved in this now?

129
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,635
- Well, she didn't know about those yet.

130
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,055
- What is... what's the watch deal?

131
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,314
- So, I needed money because
of her cat needed some stuff,

132
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,606
and I didn't have the money to cover it,

133
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,150
so I actually took two watches
and pawned them.

134
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:38,034
- Are you serious?
My watches in the drawer?

135
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,781
- Sure did.
- Those were my grandmother's
watches, Gigi.

136
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,374
- I pawned them--
I got the receipts right here.

137
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,830
- Those were heirlooms.
- Hold on, Cynthia?

138
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,121
I want to let you know that
we actually have the watches.

139
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,615
They're safe and sound.

140
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,246
- At least I didn't sell 'em.

141
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,054
- Uh, that's an actual felony
you committed by stealing

142
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,128
the watches.

143
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,593
Um...

144
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:00,553
Okay, so, wow, this is a lot to take in.

145
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:11,899
Okay, so, Cynthia, I am going
to award you these watches back.

146
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,979
Gigi, I have to, I'm-I'm gonna
dismiss this countersuit.

147
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,234
But we're doing you a solid here...

148
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,146
on letting the felony go.

149
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:23,236
And, uh, you, you owe for this car.

150
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,993
I'm gonna rule in favor
of the plaintiff for $838.20.

151
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,077
But, Gigi, I appreciate your spirit.

152
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,083
- I need to get paid.
- Court is adjourned.

153
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,245
- Can I get the watches back?

154
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,883
- Thank you guys very much.

155
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
- Thank you very much.

156
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,096
- She just stole two watches.

157
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,849
Part of it is, like,
the confession alone, like,

158
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,891
the confidence in saying, like,
"Yeah, I took those watches."

159
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,266
- I'm scared of her.

160
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,693
- She shouldn't have got that car

161
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,321
and the watches and her money.

162
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,279
I got nothing but a felony washed off.

163
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,990
I could've done that myself.

164
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,990
- Would I ever let her,
uh, watch my cat again?

165
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,622
No, and I wouldn't recommend her
to anyone.
