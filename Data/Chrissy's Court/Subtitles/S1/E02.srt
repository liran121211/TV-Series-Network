1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:02,173
Today on Chrissy's Court,

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:05,922
Milton Jenkins is suing
his ex-girlfriend Sona Durham

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,256
for the cost of a car he sold her.

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,262
Sona claims that ever since
she bought the car,

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,434
all she does is drive him around,

6
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:16,523
and her time is more valuable
than some car.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,650
The people are real, the cases are real,

8
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,188
and the judgments are legally binding,

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,192
no matter how unqualified the judge is.

10
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,565
- This is Chrissy's Court.

11
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:36,787
- All rise to the Honorable
Judge Chrissy Teigen.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,620
- Ta-da!

13
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,205
Good afternoon, everybody.
Hello, Mom.

14
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,961
- Hi.
- Hand it over.

15
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,634
Milton v. Sona.

16
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,093
Milton, go ahead and explain your case.

17
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:52,184
- Well, me and Sona started out dating,
and we became real close.

18
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,011
We got to know each other real well.

19
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:56,886
And as a partner/girlfriend,

20
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:00,144
she needed a-a way around,
and I had two cars.

21
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,597
So I decided, like,
maybe she needs to just go

22
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,148
and purchase this car from me.

23
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,981
- Basically, you started dating.

24
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,736
- Mm-hmm.
- You call it a "situation-ship."

25
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,649
- Yes.
- How do you define

26
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,857
a situation-ship?
- All right.

27
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:14,867
You know, a ship
is supposed to take you places.

28
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,870
Whether it's a relationship
or a friendship.
- Oh, it's like a ship, then.

29
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,502
You've actually made this into a... Okay.
- Right.

30
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,119
- I thought you would do
the "situation" part,

31
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,535
but you're focusing on the "ship" part.

32
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,583
Okay. Okay.
- Right, right.

33
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,747
You got friendships,
you got relationships.

34
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:26,746
- Uh-huh.
- Either this relationship

35
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,047
is gonna take you somewhere,

36
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,341
-or it's gonna sink.
- Mm.

37
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,005
- This relationship turned
into a situation-ship.

38
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,354
Like, you scratch my back,
I scratch yours.

39
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,310
- Did you think you were
in a relationship?

40
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,811
Like, an actual boyfriend,
girlfriend relationship,

41
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,234
not a situation-ship?

42
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:46,902
- I felt like I was in, um...
- Limbo?

43
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,402
- ...a sex-ship.
- Sex-ship.

44
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,493
- Ooh.
- Yay is into it.

45
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,989
- Ooh.
- So,

46
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,031
you are just asking for this car payment.

47
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,735
- Right. And then she can have
the title and the car.

48
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,996
- Okay.
- This is the car right here, Your Honor.

49
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,208
- Oh, [bleep], that's a nice car.
- Beautiful.

50
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,629
Looks like a good car.
- Do you have a contract?

51
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,588
- Yes.
- You do?

52
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,668
- Let me see that.
- Now, most people say

53
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,714
that the power is in the tongue,

54
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,547
but clearly, the power was in the pen
when she wrote that letter.

55
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,805
- Mom, do you think this
is legally binding?

56
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,309
- Looks good.
- All right. I mean,

57
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,730
you knew what you signed on for.

58
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,268
- No, because once I started driving that,

59
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,982
he made me his personal driver,
and I'm like,

60
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,693
"Okay, this wasn't the plan."

61
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,403
- So, Sona, what's your side of this?

62
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,533
- I think, for the most part,
he's just really ungrateful.

63
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:36,071
I cook dinner for him every night.

64
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,696
I do not even charge him, but...

65
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,414
- Well, if you think
you're in a relationship,

66
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,664
you wouldn't charge for it.

67
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,535
Like, I wouldn't sit John down
and be like,

68
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:46,382
"Okay, I'm gonna give you a massage,
and you have to pay me."

69
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,458
- Would you charge somebody for a car
if you were in a relationship?

70
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,505
- Yes. I mean, I-I...

71
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,048
It's... No, because he's rich,
so it's like...

72
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,639
- Okay, that's it for everyone.

73
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,009
- Okay.
- I take him to and from work

74
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,767
in this vehicle, like...
- That I put gas in.

75
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,689
- So you sold her a car that
she has to take you to work in?

76
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,098
- Not every day.
- Where's this second car?

77
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,727
- I still have it.
It's just in the shop.

78
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,114
- Okay.
- Your Honor, I have pictures,

79
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,400
if you don't mind, of...
- Yes, no, please.

80
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,444
- ...of me actually
driving him around, okay?

81
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,908
- You have pictures of you
driving him around?
- Yes, I do.

82
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,869
I have pictures of him
being a passenger, okay? Um...

83
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,155
- There's the proof, right there.

84
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:26,495
- Literally, pictures of...

85
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:29,292
All right, this is you
in the passenger's seat.

86
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,796
She is literally driving you.
- We weren't going nowhere.

87
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,339
- Sona, you paid for the gas,
you paid for...?

88
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,093
- I paid for the gas.
- I mean...

89
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,465
- I also have a list
of other things that I've done.

90
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,182
I've bought lingerie for his pleasure.

91
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,813
- That was part of my birthday gift.

92
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,144
- Sona, your breakdown-- which is titled

93
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,686
"A Very Great List
of Why I Owe Milton Nothing."

94
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,532
Re-twisted his hair; pain,
suffering, time and energy.

95
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,320
- Her energy?

96
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,324
She thrives off of my energy.
- That's a discount.

97
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,696
I was just being humble.

98
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,242
- She thinks she the sun.

99
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:07,459
- Yes.
- This is all totaling $81,000.

100
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,668
- So he owes me, basically,
you know what I mean?

101
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,251
- No.
- You're not even asking for that much.

102
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,166
You're just saying, like,
"This is what I've done for you."

103
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,224
- Right.
- I mean, I honestly get all of this,

104
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,048
because this is worth something,
um, in a relationship.

105
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,465
- Okay.
- But since you won't
call it a relationship,

106
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,934
this is where it gets
a little muddy for me.

107
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,385
Milton, do you feel like you
could owe her a dollar, even?

108
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,937
Do you feel like you owe her
for any of this stuff?

109
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,071
- If I owe her for anything,
it'd be twisting my hair.

110
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,489
The rest of that stuff, I mean,
the things that she's given,

111
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,818
I give her also.

112
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,113
- I understand your point.
- You know.

113
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,606
But this car is totally different.

114
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,617
She-she needs to make that payment.

115
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,829
You know, she tries
to give me sex instead of money.

116
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,911
I feel like I'll take that ass,

117
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,376
but she still has to pay me my $4,400.

118
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,918
- "That ass"?

119
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,092
- That is not appropriate.
That is not appropriate.

120
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,012
- If she don't want me to go out
and get another girlfriend,

121
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,881
then I think she should...
- How would you feel

122
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,718
right now if you found out Milton
was dating somebody else tomorrow?

123
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,144
- Um...
- Be honest.

124
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,562
- No, that would hurt my feelings,

125
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,430
'cause I don't date anyone else.

126
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,267
- You see potential in this relationship.

127
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,112
- I do. I do. I just don't like
to be manipulated.

128
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,898
- Would you like to be with her, too?

129
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,532
- I thought about it.

130
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,488
- I don't know why you're
putting on this front of, like,

131
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,069
"I could do any... I get anything I want."

132
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,613
Like, she seems great. So...

133
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,997
I do feel like you should
get paid for your time,

134
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:37,133
your energy, twisting his hair
and the pain.

135
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,262
I feel like there was some pain
involved, no offense.

136
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,009
Um...

137
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:45,181
But at the same time,
you also do owe him for this car,

138
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,432
so I'm ruling
in favor of the plaintiff for $3,000.

139
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,265
Thank you guys so much.
- Thank you.

140
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,608
- They're gonna get back together.
- Yeah.

141
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:56,899
They're gonna...
they're gonna [bleep] tonight.

142
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,232
That's for sure.

143
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:01,647
- I guess I did owe him some more money,

144
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:04,867
but he just needs to know
you can't manipulate people

145
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,488
to get things to go your way.

146
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,195
- The judge made some sense to me.

147
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,495
She talked to me
and made me look at the way

148
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,579
that I look at things differently now.
