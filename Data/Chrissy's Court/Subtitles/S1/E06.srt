1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:02,133
Today on Chrissy's Court,

2
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:04,631
Tiphani Lampkin is suing her ex-boyfriend,

3
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:07,883
Fred Pillow, for his half
of a canceled trip to Houston.

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,296
Fred says he doesn't owe her anything

5
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,434
because he tried to save her

6
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,602
from having to go to Houston.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,930
The people are real, the cases are real,

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,347
and the judgments are legally binding,

9
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,436
no matter how unqualified the judge is.

10
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,613
- This is Chrissy's Court.

11
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:34,156
- All rise to the Honorable
Judge Chrissy Teigen.

12
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,413
- Good afternoon, everybody.

13
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:37,535
- Hi, Judge.

14
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:38,541
- Hello, Mom.

15
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:39,962
You may be seated.

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, so we've got Tiphani
versus Fred today.

17
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:47,086
Tiphani, go ahead and tell me
your side of the story here.

18
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,172
- I had booked a trip to Houston,

19
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:50,838
uh, for my 30th birthday.

20
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,586
It was gonna be me, my best friend

21
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,298
and my boyfriend at the time-- Fred.

22
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,968
- Now an ex?
- Oh, yes, definitely.

23
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,056
- It's okay.
- I paid for it on my card.

24
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,022
- Okay.
- And he agreed to pay me back.

25
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,443
- And you were gonna go to Houston...
- Yes.

26
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,771
- ...as a joint romantic, little...
- Yeah.

27
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:06,017
- With your best friend.
- Yeah.

28
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,238
- Oh.

29
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,648
- No.

30
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,316
- Prior to the trip,

31
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,235
I had driven by his house
on my way home from work

32
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,334
and saw another girl's car parked there.

33
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,250
- So you were just doing
a drive-by, or you happen...

34
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,748
It was on your way?
- I... It was on my way.

35
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,210
- Doing a drive-by.
- No, I don't do drive-bys.

36
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,421
Literally, I drive past his house...

37
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,671
- Okay.
- ...to go home.

38
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,212
- Okay.
- It's the easiest way.

39
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,586
- One of four easy ways.
- Okay, hold on. Hold on.

40
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,183
You'll get your chance, Fred.

41
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,508
- I drove by, I was blowing up his phone,

42
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,223
calling, texting.

43
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,933
Nothing. Didn't hear from him.
- Mom, what would you do?

44
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,854
Would you have stopped?
Would you have gone in the house?

45
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,772
- I would go in with my phone and record.

46
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,152
- Mm.

47
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,558
- Okay.

48
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,566
- To use as evidence. Evidence.

49
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,228
- That is a lot.
Oh, yeah, to get evidence.

50
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,437
Now you know.
Now you know that we need evidence

51
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,646
for everything.
- Yeah.

52
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,486
- So, you actually forgave him, though?

53
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,661
- Well, he gave me,
"Oh, she's just a crazy ex-girlfriend."

54
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,121
- You believed him,
or you just decided to drop it?

55
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,412
- I dropped it, basically.
- Okay.

56
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,825
- And then, something just--
Like, it was woman's intuition.

57
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,294
- Uh-huh.
- "Check his Facebook."

58
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,583
"I bet..."

59
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,876
- Wait. Like, his account, or just

60
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,289
- kind of on his page?
- Oh, no. His log-in

61
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,917
to his account.
- You log in to his account.

62
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:11,014
- What did you find?
- Nothing.
- The first picture

63
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,799
that pops up was a picture
of him and some ex,

64
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,224
like, hugged-up
next to each other, smiling.

65
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,222
- There's nothing wrong with that.

66
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,394
You know, went to a friendly wedding.

67
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,602
- But I thought she was
the crazy ex-girlfriend.

68
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,601
- No, no.
This is a whole different person.

69
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,603
- Oh!

70
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,734
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

71
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,940
The other person had nothing
to do with it.

72
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,190
- But I don't know
if that helps your case at all.

73
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,071
- It should.
- But could you have seen this

74
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,728
if you weren't logged in?
- I would not have seen it

75
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,186
because, even though we were friends,

76
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,397
he had me set so I didn't see

77
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,028
shit that posted up. Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh!

78
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,574
- You not set no different
than anyone else on my page.

79
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,408
- Yeah, okay. Okay.
- Everybody sees the same thing.

80
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,543
- You're claiming that it's a public thing
that she could have seen?

81
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,700
- I don't know.
I mean, I don't know

82
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:43,788
how Facebook really set up.

83
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,872
- Ay-ay-ay. And so, this was

84
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,668
your last straw basically?
- Right, and I told him

85
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,882
I no longer felt comfortable
with him going on the trip,

86
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,473
but you still owe me for it,
because it's your fault

87
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:54,879
that you're not going.
- Got to say,

88
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:55,837
it's not looking good for you, buddy.

89
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,296
- When I tell my side of the story,

90
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,676
it's all gonna make sense.

91
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,062
- So you're only suing for...?

92
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,428
- $397. Just half of it.

93
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,345
I just want what he would have paid

94
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,813
if he had gone.
- Okay. That seems reasonable.

95
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,403
Okay, Fred, let's hear from you now.

96
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,108
Were you upset
about her canceling the trip?

97
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,438
- Oh, yes, 'cause I offered
to still go on the trip.

98
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,234
- Well, yeah, you...
- Yeah, I was ready.

99
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,937
I got swimming trunks.
Like, I...

100
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,567
Yes, I was ready for the trip.
I was gonna have

101
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,284
a good time no matter what.
- I bet you were, Fred.

102
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,914
I bet you were.
Okay, so let's go back then.
- So, it was...

103
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,082
- You think the relationship
was fantastic, was great, um...

104
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,450
- It was cool. It was good.
I mean, we had our ups and downs

105
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,078
like every relationship, but...
- Yes.

106
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,375
- One day, we was about to have
sex, and I wasn't in the mood,

107
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,589
so Miss Tiphani decides
to tell me, because

108
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,260
I didn't want to have sex,
that she was gonna go find

109
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,378
someone else to ..., so...
- It was a joke.

110
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,625
- I am a male.
Don't joke with me.

111
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,338
- It was a joke!

112
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,678
- Did you giggle after you said it?

113
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,562
- I texted it to you, so no.

114
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,969
- Did you... LOL?

115
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,427
- No.
- No. Okay.

116
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,137
So it's not a joke.
- Winky face, nothing?

117
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,607
- Yeah. I'm-a need something.
- Nothing.

118
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,898
No. 'Cause I was angry.
- So when she said this,

119
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,902
you genuinely thought it meant she...
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

120
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,074
You're gonna do your thing, so,
okay, I'm gonna do my thing.

121
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,953
Someone invited me to a wedding,
I went.

122
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,620
After she finds out I'm at a wedding,

123
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,158
she also spends, like, over
$1,500 on my Amazon account.

124
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,253
Yes, which I have right here.

125
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,209
- She spent $1,500 buying things
for herself?

126
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,999
- Oh, no, I bought shit...
- Sending random... random shit.

127
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,832
- ...and put it on his card
and sent it to his house.

128
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,038
- Okay, that's funny.
I like that.

129
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,797
Can I see that itemized list?

130
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,169
So, Mom, we actually, I think,
have some of these things.

131
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,966
Got him a Segway...
- This is so heavy.
- Segway.

132
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,721
- An electric skateboard.
Kind of got him, like, good shit, though.

133
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,182
Like, why wouldn't you get him,
like, silly...?

134
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,142
- I know I did.
I picked, like, really nice stuff.

135
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,353
- Does it look like I ride skateboards?

136
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,772
- You got him a bunkbed.
Like, an Army bunkbed.

137
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,851
- I'm not finna go hiking.
- All the stuff was really nice.

138
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,557
Who does that?
You're supposed to send, like, dildos

139
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,778
and, like... So, yeah.
It's about $1,500, so...

140
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,359
- There you go.
- Did you end up returning all of this?

141
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,565
- Yes, I did. And got no...
- And got his money back.

142
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,946
- And I was nice enough
to not even press charges.

143
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,543
- Why didn't you buy yourself stuff?

144
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,448
- Because I did not want
to get in trouble.

145
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,785
Well?

146
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,003
- Oh. That's some shit
I would do, honestly.

147
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,844
So it's hard for me now.

148
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,339
Sorry. How long was
your relationship in total?

149
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,340
- A year and a half.
- A year and a half

150
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,802
calling each other
"boyfriend" and "girlfriend"?
- Mm-hmm.

151
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,182
- Like, this isn't an off-and-on thing?
- Oh, no, it was

152
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,550
consistently a year and a half.
- Fred, did you ever cheat

153
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,966
in this year and a half relationship?
- Nah.

154
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,595
- Fred?
- Nah.

155
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,232
- Such a lie.
- No.
- Fred, I'm...

156
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,688
- Nah, I didn't cheat.

157
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,689
- Fred, I love you.
- No.

158
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,481
She speculated, but I never cheated.
- Okay.

159
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:18,066
- Fred?

160
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,701
Oy.

161
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,029
I feel like, honestly,
you both can get away

162
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:29,118
with murder because
you're just both so charming.

163
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,914
I've seen a lot of couples
in this courtroom,

164
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,538
and-and they've just--
It's-it's been rough

165
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,084
seeing some people.

166
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,458
And seeing you two, it still seems like

167
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,415
there is potential there
for a relationship.

168
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,165
- Oh... no.
- I'm... good.

169
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,507
- With other people.

170
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,473
- I am gonna rule in favor
of the plaintiff,

171
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,473
Tiphani, for $395 for the cost

172
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,345
of your ticket that you made her cancel.

173
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,892
Case...
- Closed.

174
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,345
- Guys, you're dismissed.
Thank you so much.

175
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,109
- I feel like she heard my case,

176
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,651
and she understand it,
and she agreed with me.

177
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,605
- I can't help it.
I'm charming.

178
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,065
- He's a damn good cheater, honestly.
I will say that.

179
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:07,076
- You can see it in his eyes.
- I know, right?
