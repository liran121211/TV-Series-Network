<i>Still the lure of the fisherman's tale</i>

345
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,752
<i>was too great to ignore.</i>

346
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,795
RICHARD: I'm a little nervous
that if it doesn't happen,

347
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,349
there goes my credibility.

348

<i>but one of them is still skeptical.</i>

350
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,874
It's gonna be pretty spectacular if...

351
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,113
if a sea lion could actually chase down
and kill a tuna.

352
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,913
I'm still yet to be convinced.

353
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,674
<i>They set up camp
in this barren cove,</i>

354
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,034

355
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,513
<i>The local wildlife,

<i>With no sign of the sea lions,</i>

<i>Field assistant Roby Pepolas

361

ROBY: This is the point of view

00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,877
where we try to see
the sea lions come in

363
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,673
jumping over the water.

364
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,070
If they're definitely coming very close,

365
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,790
they say, "Action, action,"
or "Rock and roll."

366
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,280

<i>The aerial team are first up.</i>

370
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,994
<i>It's a sea lion chasing tuna
into the bay.</i>

371
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,799
Oh, he's got it. He's got it.

372
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,160
Unbelievable!

373
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,238
Look at that, he's still struggling.

374
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,954
Holy moly!

375
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,356
He's lost him.

376
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,515
<i>The tuna gives the sea lion the slip.</i>

377
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,597
<i>Over the coming days,
more sea lions arrive in the cove</i>

378
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,672
<i>chasing in yellowfin tuna.</i>

379
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,471
RACHEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh!

380
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,356
I bet you there's more tuna
and another sea lion.

381
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,315
There's like six tuna in that bay.

382
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,475
<i>One sea lion
has caught Richard's attention,</i>

383
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,792
<i>and he's affectionately
called him Tagboy.</i>

384
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,679
RICHARD: He's really different.
He's, like, a prolific hunter,

385
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,598
and he's really agile.

386
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:13,116
It's just fascinating to watch and see
the picture emerge about who he is.

387
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,075
<i>From above,
the drone is revealing</i>

388
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,675
<i>how the group of sea lions
are hunting together.</i>

389
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,072
From the air, we really see
the strategy of the sea lion

390
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,880
and see them
with their individual roles as well.

391
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,719
Tagboy stays off
in the middle of the channel

392
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,359
to make sure none of them escape.

393
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,430
Everyone's got a role

394
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,637
and they're really a team
in bringing them together.

395
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,678
<i>Although the sea lions
have been hunting in the shallows,</i>

396
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,436
<i>the crew are yet to see them
drive a tuna onto the beach.</i>

397
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,393
<i>And to make matters worse,
the sea lions aren't alone in this cove.</i>

398
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,353
<i>Galapagos sharks, each two metres long.</i>

399
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,316
The shark almost beached itself

400
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,313
and stole the tuna
from the big sea lion,

401
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,033
who is now really angry.

402
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,120
<i>Despite the sharks,</i>

403
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,200
<i>to reveal the full story,
Richard needs to get in the water.</i>

404
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,318
RICHARD: Classic shark attack scenario.
Blood in the water, shallow,

405
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,518
and easy mistaken identity.

406
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,719
RACHEL: Watch your hands, Roby.

407
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,831
<i>DAVID: The crew gain some protection
from chain mail suits.</i>

408
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,829
This is not a shark pool.

409
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,719
One, two, three, four, five,
six sharks (CHUCKLES) now.

410
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:54,637
<i>With so much blood in the water,
the sharks go into a feeding frenzy.</i>

411
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,917
RICHARD: Make mince meat
of these tuna in seconds.

412
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,478
To be so close to something
so unbelievably ferocious

413
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,076
and dangerous, quite frankly,

414
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,198
is amazing. It's... It's...

415
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,870
It's nice to be able to hide
behind all this though.

416
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,192
<i>But then, after a week
of increasing activity,</i>

417
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,239
<i>the sea lions suddenly stop fishing.</i>

418
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,915
ROBY: It's the first day though

419
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,117
that we haven't seen any action
during the whole day.

420
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,358
Since we start.

421
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,799
We are kind of worried.

422
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,397
<i>The tuna have disappeared.</i>

423
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,674
<i>Richard is worried.</i>

424
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,995
The signs are starting to show
across the globe

425
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,914
that the seas are warming,
they're becoming less productive.

426
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,559
<i>Galapagos marine life
relies on cold, deep currents</i>

427
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,196
<i>welling up intermittently
to fertilize the surface waters.</i>

428

(BARKING)

429
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,549
If those upwellings
become less consistent,

430
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,076
er, their lives could well be
in jeopardy.

431
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,716
<i>In the past,</i>

432
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,032
<i>when these cold water upwellings
have temporarily stopped,</i>

433
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,796
<i>many sea lions have starved to death.</i>

434
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,510
<i>And a warming ocean
could further weaken these upwellings.</i>

435
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,073
<i>Then after two weeks of nervous waiting,</i>

436
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,475
<i>a hopeful sign.</i>

437
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,553
<i>A thick fog descends over the cove.</i>

438
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,074
We've got very cold water
that's come up, upwelled,

439
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,840
and spread across the ocean,

440
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,437
and mixed with the warm air,
creating the fog

441
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,952
and hoping that this cold water

442
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,030
will just kick things off a bit,
you know, and get the action going.

443
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,674
<i>As the fog clears,
a welcome sight...</i>

444
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,430
<i>The tuna are back
with sea lions hot on their heels.</i>

445
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,473

<i>and finally film Tagboy beaching a tuna.</i>

RICHARD: The know the bottlenecks
in this labyrinth.

451
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,351
They know how to push them
into those bottlenecks

452
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,800
and threre was just Tagboy,

453
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,520
almost his entire body
was blocking the entrance,

454
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,952
and he was just gently back and forth
tiring the fish out.

455
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,359
Absolutely extraordinary.
Really, really impressive.
