<i>and discovered new insights into</i>
<i>how life is lived beneath the waves.</i>

6
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,399
For years we thought
that the oceans were so vast

7
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,791
and the inhabitants
so infinitely numerous

8
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,396
that nothing we could do
could have an effect upon them.

9
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,551

00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,749
the herrings that we see around us here
was on the brink of collapse.

From 1982, orcas got protected in Norway

48

(LAUGHS)

62
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,119
It is the least invasive method.
It is suction cups.

63
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,715
So it is not a scratch
on the whale afterwards

64
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,519
which is something we really like.

65
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,712
<i>While studying the orcas,</i>

66
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,316
<i>Eve noticed a worrying change</i>
<i>in their behaviour.</i>

67
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,438
<i>They had worked out</i>
<i>the easiest way to get a meal.</i>

68
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,071
EVE: We have seen that
the orcas are waiting

69
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,629
for those fishing boats to drop the net.

70
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,958
It acts like a dinner bell

71
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,874
and then all the orcas
of the area gather.

72
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,593
Quite a lot of herring slip from the net

73
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,320
and this is exactly what
the orcas are looking for.

74
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,993
<i>But this new tactic</i>
<i>is dangerous, as Eve has witnessed.</i>

75
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,273
We were there to monitor
the behaviour of the orcas

76
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,511
scavenging around the nets.

77
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,593
And we realised that
one large adult male

78
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,717
was actually trapped inside the net.

79
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,076
When the fishermen
started to retrieve the net

80
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,755
the orca was obviously starting to panic

81
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,992
and trying to pull as much as he could.

82
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,515
This orca was really fighting
for his life.

83
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,990
<i>Stringent rules require fishermen</i>

84
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,834
<i>to get permission</i>
<i>before they open their nets.</i>

85
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,194
<i>But that took time.</i>

86
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,992
EVE: It was such a long process.

87
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,839
We thought that the whale
was going to die of exhaustion.

88
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,394
<i>Thankfully, the fishermen</i>
<i>finally got the clearance</i>

89
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,951
<i>to release their net</i>
<i>freeing the exhausted orca.</i>

90
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,957
It was a huge relief to see that
this orca made it until the end

91
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,600
and finally got back to his family.

92
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,589
<i>With marine mammals</i>
<i>and humans competing so directly</i>

93
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,911
<i>accidents are inevitable.</i>

94
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,789
<i>Two days after tagging an orca,</i>

95
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,714
<i>it's released and Eve collects it.</i>

96
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,271
This tag is full of secrets, you know,

97
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,556
because it has been on
the whale for several days

98
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,792
and will just reveal exactly
what the whales have been doing.

99
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,753
<i>Pictures from the tag</i>
<i>reveal the hunting technique in detail.</i>

100
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,153
<i>They dive below the ball of fish</i>

101
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,798
<i>and then back flip.</i>

102
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,034
<i>The tail slap stuns the herring.</i>

103
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,594
<i>Eve can even work out</i>
<i>how many fish the orcas are taking.</i>

104
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,360
EVE: They can kill up to 30 herring
with just one tail slap.

105
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,318
And then what is pretty amazing is

106
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,438
all the individuals of the group
share the dead herring.

107
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,754
<i>And it's not just</i>
<i>the orcas feeding here...</i>

108
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,436
<i>Humpback whales</i>
<i>are also drawn to the feast.</i>

109
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,315
<i>They too are being tagged and monitored</i>

110
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,357
<i>giving fishery scientist Leif</i>

111
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,877
<i>a complete picture of</i>
<i>how much herring is being eaten.</i>

112
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,675
The whales, they take
probably less than 1%.

113
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,912
The fishermen take less than 10%.

114
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,429
So the balance there is that
there is enough for everybody.

115
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,399
Given that we manage to stock
in sustainable

116
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,312
and a long term sustainable way.

117
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,952

<i>almost a third of ocean fisheries</i>

<i>are being over exploited.</i>

<i>The remarkable recovery</i>
<i>of the herring here</i>

120

121
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,198

popping away at the predator.

But as soon as the boat came over
they looked completely distracted.

173

changed how the fish were behaving.

this natural biological noise,

182
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,440
robbing animals of their ability to be

<i>All this noise may have</i>
<i>serious consequences for many reef fish</i>

184
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,073
<i>because their babies, as soon as they</i>
<i>hatch are swept out to sea.</i>

185
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,755
<i>There they feed and grow</i>
<i>until strong enough to swim back.</i>

186
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,634
<i>And to find the reef, they use sound.</i>

187
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,679
STEVE: They listen in. They eavesdrop
to the noises that they can hear

188
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,958
and they use that to choose which reef
they want to make their home.

189
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,720
But obviously because we're adding
all this noise to the ocean

190
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,190
it's a wonder whether they can even
hear the reef at all.

that you get a sense of these creatures.

236
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,960
And the albatrosses here have,
over the past 10 years, been in decline.

237
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,478
<i>There are a number of</i>
<i>possible reasons.</i>

<i>While foraging at sea,</i>

241
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,958
<i>by what the parents are bringing back</i>
<i>for their chick.</i>

242
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,835
LUCY: Albatrosses have
the ability to cough up

243
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,230
bits of food that they can't digest.

244
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,154
And from that we can tell
what they've been eating.

245
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,233
A healthy albatross chick in its diet
should really have things like squid.

246
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,075
So we can find the squid beaks
that come out of the pellet.

247
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,710
And also things like fish
so we can find fish bones as well.

<i>But these chicks are being</i>
<i>fed something very different.</i>

Here we have some food packaging.
Looks like rice.

Luckily for this chick, he has managed
to get this out of his stomach.

253

any more plastic left in there

the stomach.

258
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,998
Something just as small as that has
actually has managed to kill the bird.

a vast underestimation

that we happen to find.

<i>To find out where</i>
<i>all this rubbish is coming from,</i>

<i>Lucy and her team have attached</i>

going to find food for themselves

268

and to find food to bring back
for their chicks.

269
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,234
It really shows us that
they could be picking up plastic

270
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,710
from thousands of miles away.

271
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,279
Plastics coming from either being
dumped at sea

272
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,955
or also from people's homes.

273
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,750
Plastic gets into the rivers and then
the rivers flow into the sea.

274
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,910
So this isn't just a problem
around these remote parts.

<i>could provide crucial evidence.</i>

00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,197
These young calves are dying

are playing a large role.

00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,592
I grew up in a household where
the presence of turtle meat was normal.

338
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,478
The fridge was always full of it.

339
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,598
Everybody... Everybody harvested
turtles, including my parents.

340
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,029
It's only when I became
exposed to things

341
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,918
that were being published
about leatherbacks

342
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,434

343
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,079
And nobody cares.

344
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,640
That piqued my interest.

345
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,720
<i>Len took the leatherback's</i>
<i>future into his own hands.</i>

346
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,435
<i>He began patrolling the beach at night</i>
<i>to protect the turtles.</i>

347
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,639

I've had persons physically
try to wrestle me with a machete.

353
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,400
So it was really
a hostile time back then.

<i>If Len was going to</i>
<i>save these turtles</i>

355

356
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,473
LEN: We had to find a way to
get the villagers to benefit

358
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,430

359
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,433

Uh, Shanie.

- That's correct.

365
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,275
Leatherbacks can grow to 2,000 pounds.

366
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,919
Well, that's a big turtle.

367
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,597

368

372

LEN: If the eggs are laid
too close to the sea,

377
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,835

Now, it's over 500.

385

392
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,558
And those dangers will be
greatly increased

393

501
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,997
DAYA: We saw about 1 5 sperm whales
go past us.

502
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,797
Then, another four came past us.

503
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,597
After about 40 then passed me,
I started counting.

504
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,075
Still, they kept coming,
so I lost count.

505
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,478
I estimated that we saw about
300 sperm whales.

506
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,960
<i>Sperm whales were once</i>
<i>killed in vast numbers</i>

507
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,879
<i>and it's thought that if the slaughter</i>
<i>had continued,</i>

508
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,351
<i>the species would be in danger</i>
<i>of extermination.</i>

509
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:56,351
<i>But now, here at least,</i>
<i>they are being seen in huge numbers.</i>

510
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,675
DAYA: I believe they come here to feed,
mate, and raise their young.

511
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,315
So, this must be a holiday spot
for them, you know.

512
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,951
At the moment, I don't know
of any other place in the world

513
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,760
that, er, sperm whales gather like this.

514
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,790
<i>Although some whale</i>
<i>populations are still in decline,</i>

515
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,591
<i>scenes like this prove that when</i>
<i>sea-going nations come together,</i>

516
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,718
<i>they can achieve astonishing results.</i>

517
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:39,073
<i>But today, the oceans face threats</i>
<i>on a truly global scale.</i>

518
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,797
<i>The Great Barrier Reef.</i>

519
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,677
<i>The largest coral reef system</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

520
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:00,640
<i>Here, we filmed stories which reveal</i>
<i>just how smart fish can be.</i>

521
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,074
<i>This ingenious tuskfish, for example,</i>

522
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:13,552
<i>used a favourite coral anvil</i>
<i>to smash open shellfish.</i>

523
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,311
<i>This astonishing behaviour</i>
<i>has been closely studied</i>

524
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,835
<i>by local scientist Alex Vail.</i>

525
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,069
We're calling Percy
"Percy the Persistent"

526
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,598
because he took, like, an hour
to open the first shell.

527
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,430
He must have hit it well over 50 times,

528
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,399
but he just kept on going
and finally got it open.

529
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,878
<i>Alex grew up</i>
<i>on the Great Barrier Reef</i>

530
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,759
<i>on one of its more remote islands,</i>
<i>Lizard.</i>

531
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,396
<i>He knows the reef intimately.</i>

532
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,475
<i>But, in 2016, while he was filming</i>
<i>for</i> Blue Planet II,

533
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,075
<i>Alex witnessed a catastrophe.</i>

534
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,919
ALEX: When we started filming,
everything was pretty much fine.

535
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,071
All of the corals
were basically healthy.

536
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,477
But in the last few weeks,
everything changed.

537
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,240
I have never seen anything
like this before.

538
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,591
<i>A combination of a warming ocean</i>

539
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,276
<i>and an unpredictable weather event</i>
<i>called El Niño</i>

540
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,000
<i>raised sea temperatures</i>
<i>to record levels.</i>

541
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,277
<i>And this had a disastrous effect</i>
<i>on the corals.</i>

542
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,033
<i>The heat causes reef-building corals</i>
<i>to lose their nourishing algae,</i>

543
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,555
<i>exposing their white skeletons.</i>

544
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,559
<i>When temperatures remain high,</i>
<i>bleached corals die off.</i>

545
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,399
The bleaching this year has been
the worst in history

546
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,914
for the Great Barrier Reef.

547
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,435
About 90 percent of the branching corals

548
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,876
on the reef out here at Lizard Island
are dead.

549
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,514
<i>It also has disastrous consequences</i>

550
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,751
<i>for the other creatures that live here.</i>

551
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,994
ALEX: Percy swimming around out there.

552
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,079
The really sad thing is that his
castle's starting to bleach.

553
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,592
If we lose our coral, there's a chance
we're going to lose our tuskfish.

554
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,156
It's incredibly sad to see areas
that you've dived on

555
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,438
since you were a little kid
just turn to rubble.

556
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,717
I cried in my mask, when I saw,

557
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,917
you know, some of the devastation
from this bleaching.

558
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,718
<i>In the last three years,</i>

559
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,713
<i>over two-thirds</i>
<i>of the world's coral reefs</i>

560
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,516
<i>are thought to have suffered from rises</i>
<i>in ocean temperatures.</i>

561
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,676
<i>This is not the only challenge</i>
<i>they face.</i>

562
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,795
<i>Research is revealing</i>
<i>how the fundamental</i>

563
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,156
<i>chemistry of the ocean is changing.</i>

564
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,878
<i>Professor Chris Langdon shows me</i>
<i>what this might mean</i>

565
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,830
<i>for the future of our seas</i>
<i>by pouring dilute acid over shells.</i>

566
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,470
And how much more acidic is this
than the present ocean?

567
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,591
CHRIS: This is more concentrated than
the pH of the ocean

568
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,477
but it accelerates the process
so we can see something visually.

569
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,277
So, what's happening is, these shells,
they're made out of calcium carbonate,

570
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,559
and the acid is dissolving them.

571
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,915
And coral reefs are made out of
the same material as these shells here.

572
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,834
But surely this is not happening
in the ocean now. Right now?

573
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,391
What we're seeing here is more dramatic
than what's happening in the ocean.

574
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,157
But the shells and the reefs
are really truly dissolving.

575
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,358
Coral reefs could be gone by the end
of this century.

576
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,031
<i>And the cause of this?</i>
<i>Carbon dioxide.</i>

577
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,271
<i>Dissolved in the sea water,</i>
<i>it forms carbonic acid.</i>

578
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,715
<i>The more carbon dioxide</i>
<i>in the atmosphere,</i>

579
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,110
<i>the more acidic the ocean becomes.</i>

580
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,119
<i>Evidence points to the burning</i>
<i>of fossil fuels</i>

581
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:59,792
<i>as the primary cause for these</i>
<i>increasing levels of carbon dioxide.</i>

582
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,200
And this is man-made beyond question.

583
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,475
Beyond question.

584
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,672
<i>But Chris believes all is not lost.</i>

585
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,160
All we have to do, and I say all,
is reduce our CO2 emissions.

586
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,359
We can switch to renewable fuels,
wind and solar,

587
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,397
instead of natural fossil fuels.

588
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,153
And so, none of this has to

589
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,470
- develop to the worst case.
- And that could fix it?

590
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:34,157
Yeah, absolutely. So, this future does
not have to play out. It's up to us.

<i>break up, they allow water,</i>

<i>which has been locked up on land as ice</i>
<i>for thousands of years,</i>

635
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,998
<i>to empty into the sea.</i>

636
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,072
<i>And this is predicted to push up</i>
<i>sea levels.</i>

637
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,758
If the ice shelves break up,
then that opens the flood gates.

638
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,717
Ice on land flows faster into the sea

639
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,439
and that's what pushes up
the sea levels.

640
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:43,115
So, what's happening here right now

can be duplicated just a little bit.

663
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,074
These animals will have a chance
of surviving.

664
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:10,032
JOHN: It comes down, I think, to us each
taking responsibility

665
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,755
for the personal choices that we make
in our everyday lives.

666
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,674
That's all any of us can be expected
to do.

667
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,320
And it is those everyday choices
that add up.

668
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,673
We are at a unique stage in our history.

669
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:41,514
Never before have we had
such an awareness

670
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,557
of what we are doing to the planet.

671
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:49,629
And never before have we had the power
to do something about that.

672
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:55,555
Surely, we have a responsibility
to care for our blue planet.

673
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,479
The future of humanity,

674
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,792
and indeed all life on Earth,

675
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,156
now depends on us.
