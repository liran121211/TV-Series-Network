2
00:00:30,412 --> 00:00:32,132
Antarctica.

3
00:00:35,652 --> 00:00:40,692
The coldest, the harshest and the
most remote continent on Earth.

4
00:00:48,012 --> 00:00:52,772
No human being has ever descended
into the depths that surround it...

5
00:00:55,932 --> 00:00:57,412
...until now.

6
00:01:04,572 --> 00:01:09,132
The deep ocean is as challenging to
explore as space.

7
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:16,091
We know more about the surface of
Mars than we do about the

8
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:17,812
deepest parts of our seas.

9
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:45,691
Now we can dive these uncharted
depths to discover

10
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:47,932
what secrets lie beneath.

11
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:27,091
Sinking down beside the submerged
wall of an iceberg,

12
00:02:27,092 --> 00:02:29,532
we enter an unforgiving world.

13
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:42,932
These waters are
the coldest on Earth.

14
00:02:47,572 --> 00:02:52,372
As we descend into the deep, the
pressure increases relentlessly.

15
00:03:09,852 --> 00:03:12,892
And the light from above
all but disappears.

16
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:22,172
Yet, incredibly...

17
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,612
...there is life here.

18
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:52,811
We might have expected that, deep
beneath the surface of

19
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:57,252
the polar seas, the waters would be
truly barren.

20
00:04:05,092 --> 00:04:09,732
But in fact we find life here in
unimaginable abundance.

21
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:28,132
Nor is such great abundance confined
to Antarctic waters.

22
00:04:31,492 --> 00:04:35,731
Currents carry this richness into
the depths of almost every ocean

23
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:37,772
around the world.

24
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:44,051
Astonishingly, in the deep sea,

25
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:47,732
there is more life than anywhere
else on Earth.

26
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:19,052
The sunlight fades
and the seas darken.

27
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:25,771
Here in the Pacific,
200 metres down,

28
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:28,772
we enter an alien world.

29
00:05:31,252 --> 00:05:33,691
The Twilight Zone -

30
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:36,452
a sea of eternal gloom.

31
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:46,412
There are strange creatures here.

32
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:49,252
A pyrosome.

33
00:05:50,612 --> 00:05:56,411
A tube of jelly two metres long that
dwarfs a visitor from above -

34
00:05:56,412 --> 00:05:58,452
an oceanic whitetip shark.

35
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:10,972
Only a tiny amount of light filters
down this far.

36
00:06:15,852 --> 00:06:20,372
Survival here means making the most
of every last glimmer.

37
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:31,372
A swordfish.

38
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:42,651
Its eyes are as big as tennis balls,

39
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,252
to help it see
in the perpetual dusk.

40
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:52,211
A squid,

41
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,532
but this is one
that lives only here.

42
00:06:56,052 --> 00:06:58,732
Its right eye looks
permanently downwards.

43
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:05,011
But its left eye is much bigger and
trained upwards to detect the

44
00:07:05,012 --> 00:07:08,292
silhouettes of prey
swimming nearer the surface.

45
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:13,972
No wonder it's nicknamed
"the cockeyed squid".

46
00:07:20,332 --> 00:07:21,972
And even stranger.

47
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:26,452
This is barreleye...

48
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,971
...a fish with a transparent head

49
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:37,692
filled with jelly so that it can
look up through its skull.

50
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:59,531
We now know that the Twilight Zone
is a refuge for an incredible

51
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:02,732
90% of all fish in the ocean.

52
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:14,251
Only at night do vast shoals of
lanternfish migrate to the surface

53
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:16,172
to feed on tiny plankton.

54
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:30,372
By day, they retreat back down here.

55
00:08:46,332 --> 00:08:47,892
Humboldt squid.

56
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:03,492
Two metres long
and 50 kilos in weight.

57
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:11,892
Like most squid,
they're voracious hunters.

58
00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:21,092
There are hundreds of them.

59
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:34,731
They've found a shoal
of lanternfish,

60
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:38,092
hiding 800 metres down,
off the coast of South America.

61
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,811
Their tentacles are armed with
powerful suckers

62
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:55,732
with which they grab their prey.

63
00:10:12,132 --> 00:10:14,732
And when there are no more
lanternfish to be found...

64
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:19,452
...they turn on each other.

65
00:10:30,332 --> 00:10:33,772
This squid has caught a smaller one
in its tentacles.

66
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:40,891
To hide its capture from the rest,

67
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:43,252
it releases a smokescreen
of black ink.

68
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:58,852
But then an even bigger one
challenges it...

69
00:11:05,772 --> 00:11:07,612
...and steals its catch.

70
00:11:16,852 --> 00:11:21,132
The Twilight Zone is the Humboldt
squid's favoured hunting ground.

71
00:11:22,772 --> 00:11:24,372
They seldom go deeper...

72
00:11:26,012 --> 00:11:29,172
...into the world of perpetual
blackness below...

73
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:36,252
...The Midnight Zone.

74
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:51,612
Two thirds of a mile from the
surface, beyond the reach the sun.

75
00:11:57,412 --> 00:11:59,691
A giant black void,

76
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:03,692
larger than all the rest of the
world's habitats combined.

77
00:12:08,772 --> 00:12:10,292
There's life here...

78
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,772
...but not as we know it.

79
00:12:24,692 --> 00:12:28,652
Alien-like creatures produce
dazzling displays of light.

80
00:12:41,652 --> 00:12:46,092
Nearly all animals need to attract
mates and repel predators.

81
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:53,291
This language of light is so
widespread here that these signals

82
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:56,971
are probably the commonest
form of communication

83
00:12:56,972 --> 00:12:59,532
on the entire planet.

84
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:04,012
And yet we still know
little about them.

85
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,251
Hunters illuminate themselves,
and by doing so

86
00:13:31,252 --> 00:13:33,172
attract inquisitive prey.

87
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,732
This is fangtooth.

88
00:13:49,812 --> 00:13:53,532
It has the largest teeth for its
size of any fish.

89
00:13:56,292 --> 00:14:00,411
There are pressure sensors all over
its head and body which can detect

90
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:02,812
anything moving
in the surrounding water.

91
00:14:09,572 --> 00:14:12,972
It's the Midnight Zone's
most voracious fish.

92
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:18,092
But prey use light as a distraction.

93
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:25,412
A decoy of luminous ink.

94
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:37,092
Down here, in this blackness...

95
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:42,492
...creatures live beyond
the normal rules of time.

96
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:52,971
Siphonophores are virtually eternal.

97
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:55,372
They repeatedly clone themselves...

98
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:00,252
...some eventually growing longer
than a blue whale.

99
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:27,052
Down here it snows.

100
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:38,651
Continuous clouds of organic debris

101
00:15:38,652 --> 00:15:41,092
drift slowly down from above.

102
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:51,611
This is food, and a whole variety

103
00:15:51,612 --> 00:15:54,332
of filter feeders depend on it.

104
00:15:57,732 --> 00:15:59,092
Jellyfish...

105
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:09,932
...and delicate sea cucumbers.

106
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:32,331
The 1% of marine snow they miss

107
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:34,612
eventually settles on the sea floor.

108
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:06,531
Over millions of years
it forms a layer of mud

109
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:08,572
up to a mile thick.

110
00:17:13,092 --> 00:17:15,411
It's an empty plain that covers

111
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:17,732
half the surface of our planet.

112
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:47,812
The deep sea bed
may at first appear lifeless...

113
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:54,212
...but it's home to
a unique cast of mud-dwellers.

114
00:17:57,132 --> 00:17:58,532
The sea toad.

115
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:05,412
It is an ambush predator
with an enormous mouth...

116
00:18:07,132 --> 00:18:09,092
...and infinite patience.

117
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:22,851
This fish has been living
for so long here

118
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,611
that its fins have changed

119
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:26,412
into something more useful.

120
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,212
Feet.

121
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:41,772
They help it shuffle about
on the sea floor.

122
00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:03,972
The flapjack octopus.

123
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:13,371
It hovers just above the surface of
the mud as it delicately sifts

124
00:19:13,372 --> 00:19:15,852
through it, searching for worms.

125
00:19:19,252 --> 00:19:22,692
But it can jet away at
the first sign of danger.

126
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:44,852
A sixgill shark
as big as a great white.

127
00:19:46,372 --> 00:19:49,572
It may not have eaten
for an entire year.

128
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:58,171
It patrols the mud plains

129
00:19:58,172 --> 00:20:00,812
using a minimum amount of energy.

130
00:20:14,612 --> 00:20:17,411
High above, the carcass of a huge

131
00:20:17,412 --> 00:20:20,212
sperm whale is slowly decaying.

132
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,932
This will be a bonanza for the
creatures of the deep.

133
00:20:31,172 --> 00:20:34,252
Food, 30 tonnes of it.

134
00:20:47,492 --> 00:20:51,012
Finally, it settles
on the ocean floor...

135
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:55,532
...and its presence is soon detected.

136
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:10,172
Sixgill sharks have an
exceptionally acute sense of smell.

137
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:18,612
Just 25 minutes after the whale's
carcass arrives...

138
00:21:20,772 --> 00:21:22,652
...a sixgill finds it.

139
00:21:43,892 --> 00:21:47,132
Each bite releases blood
into the current.

140
00:22:28,532 --> 00:22:31,732
The news that food is here
spreads quickly.

141
00:22:40,012 --> 00:22:43,332
Two more ravenous sixgills arrive.

142
00:22:52,092 --> 00:22:53,691
Within 12 hours,

143
00:22:53,692 --> 00:22:55,611
there are seven enormous sharks

144
00:22:55,612 --> 00:22:59,492
jostling with one another as they
compete to tear off mouthfuls.

145
00:23:11,812 --> 00:23:14,172
No-one is prepared to back off.

146
00:23:57,572 --> 00:24:01,692
24 hours later and a third of the
carcass has gone.

147
00:24:33,332 --> 00:24:37,252
The first arrival has gorged until
it's completely full.

148
00:24:42,372 --> 00:24:47,452
This single meal may be enough to
sustain it for a whole year.

149
00:24:53,932 --> 00:24:56,932
Now the clean-up team arrives.

150
00:25:00,172 --> 00:25:03,851
Spider crabs carrying coral
in their hind legs,

151
00:25:03,852 --> 00:25:06,772
presumably as makeshift body armour.

152
00:25:15,012 --> 00:25:16,732
There are rock crabs here, too.

153
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:23,572
They probably detected the carcass
almost as soon as the sharks...

154
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:27,132
...but they can't move as fast.

155
00:25:31,812 --> 00:25:34,091
A month on, and over 30 species of

156
00:25:34,092 --> 00:25:36,691
scavenger are clearing away the last

157
00:25:36,692 --> 00:25:38,212
edible fragments.

158
00:25:40,892 --> 00:25:44,812
But now the scavengers are
attracting their own predators.

159
00:25:51,212 --> 00:25:54,411
Scabbardfish,
habitually swimming upright,

160
00:25:54,412 --> 00:25:56,172
are picking them off one by one.

161
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:21,331
Some of the whale's teeth have been
dislodged as the skeleton starts to

162
00:26:21,332 --> 00:26:22,772
fall apart.

163
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:30,692
Four months later, there is nothing
left but a few bones.

164
00:26:38,412 --> 00:26:40,172
But even they are food...

165
00:26:44,332 --> 00:26:45,692
...for something.

166
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:54,292
Zombie worms.

167
00:26:58,212 --> 00:27:01,652
They tunnel into the bones by
injecting acid...

168
00:27:02,652 --> 00:27:06,532
...and so reach the tiny amounts of
fat that still remain there.

169
00:27:08,932 --> 00:27:11,291
It may take decades, but eventually

170
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:14,451
the last of the bones will crumble

171
00:27:14,452 --> 00:27:16,931
and the whole 30-tonne carcass

172
00:27:16,932 --> 00:27:18,972
will have been recycled.

173
00:27:26,172 --> 00:27:29,171
A whale fall is a temporary oasis

174
00:27:29,172 --> 00:27:31,372
in the desert of the sea floor.

175
00:27:34,772 --> 00:27:37,252
But there are permanent
oases here, too.

176
00:27:51,412 --> 00:27:54,051
Rocks projecting above the mud

177
00:27:54,052 --> 00:27:57,012
provide anchorage
for deep-sea corals.

178
00:28:15,452 --> 00:28:18,971
As far down as 3.5 miles,

179
00:28:18,972 --> 00:28:22,171
there are more species of coral
in the deep

180
00:28:22,172 --> 00:28:24,692
than on shallow tropical reefs.

181
00:28:33,132 --> 00:28:35,331
Without sunlight,

182
00:28:35,332 --> 00:28:38,052
they rely solely
on food drifting in the current.

183
00:28:41,892 --> 00:28:46,532
And they grow just
a hair's breadth a year.

184
00:28:52,252 --> 00:28:55,892
But some of them can live
for 4,000 years.

185
00:29:02,612 --> 00:29:05,971
They, like their shallow water
relatives,

186
00:29:05,972 --> 00:29:08,892
provide homes for
all kinds of other creatures.

187
00:29:34,452 --> 00:29:39,012
Growing among the corals is one of
the most beautiful of sponges.

188
00:29:42,732 --> 00:29:46,052
This is Venus' flower basket.

189
00:29:53,732 --> 00:29:55,572
These sponges have lodgers.

190
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:58,572
Shrimps.

191
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:08,931
There are plenty of predators
on the reef,

192
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,772
so the shrimps are fortunate.

193
00:30:15,372 --> 00:30:18,891
Both this male and female were swept
into this sponge

194
00:30:18,892 --> 00:30:20,731
when they were tiny larvae,

195
00:30:20,732 --> 00:30:22,811
along with the minute particles of

196
00:30:22,812 --> 00:30:25,132
food on which the sponge feeds.

197
00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:32,812
They found each other and have been
here ever since.

198
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,851
Now they're full-grown

199
00:30:49,852 --> 00:30:52,332
and the female is carrying eggs.

200
00:31:05,452 --> 00:31:09,412
Once hatched, the larvae will swim
out through the sponge's walls.

201
00:31:15,772 --> 00:31:18,212
But the shrimps will never leave.

202
00:31:19,572 --> 00:31:21,092
They can't.

203
00:31:27,332 --> 00:31:30,731
They are now far too big to go out
the way they came in,

204
00:31:30,732 --> 00:31:34,571
and no doubt they will live longer
here than they would

205
00:31:34,572 --> 00:31:38,452
if they were wandering about on the
reef unprotected.

206
00:31:51,252 --> 00:31:55,731
But how one of the simplest of all
animals, a sponge,

207
00:31:55,732 --> 00:31:59,251
is able to build
such a complex structure,

208
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:01,452
to the great benefit of the
shrimps...

209
00:32:02,852 --> 00:32:05,091
...is a mystery...

210
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:07,212
...and surely a marvel.

211
00:32:24,172 --> 00:32:28,692
But today their timeless world is
being reduced to rubble.

212
00:32:37,052 --> 00:32:41,331
As overfishing empties the
surface waters of the seas,

213
00:32:41,332 --> 00:32:44,972
trawlers have started
to ransack the deep.

214
00:32:48,412 --> 00:32:51,131
Now countless numbers of the reefs

215
00:32:51,132 --> 00:32:53,531
that have flourished here
for millennia

216
00:32:53,532 --> 00:32:55,372
lie in ruins.

217
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:29,692
Over time, organic matter on the sea
floor slowly decays...

218
00:33:30,732 --> 00:33:32,252
...producing methane.

219
00:34:33,732 --> 00:34:35,691
In the Gulf of Mexico

220
00:34:35,692 --> 00:34:39,572
these eruptions also release
a super-salty liquid.

221
00:34:47,572 --> 00:34:49,172
Brine.

222
00:35:00,092 --> 00:35:03,211
Five times heavier than seawater,

223
00:35:03,212 --> 00:35:06,532
it accumulates in great pools
on the sea floor.

224
00:35:12,332 --> 00:35:14,812
It's difficult to make sense
of the sight.

225
00:35:22,132 --> 00:35:27,131
A lake of concentrated saltwater,
15 metres deep

226
00:35:27,132 --> 00:35:29,372
at the bottom of the sea.

227
00:35:37,572 --> 00:35:40,971
Around its margin,
perhaps even more strangely,

228
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,612
there is a profusion of life.

229
00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:54,531
Giant mussels, that can live and
grow for a century or more,

230
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:56,611
pack tightly together,

231
00:35:56,612 --> 00:36:00,332
dwarfing the shrimps and squat
lobsters that feed around them.

232
00:36:29,132 --> 00:36:32,171
Cutthroat eels, scavengers,

233
00:36:32,172 --> 00:36:36,172
come to the shores of the brine lake
in search of something edible.

234
00:36:44,972 --> 00:36:47,932
Some even venture into the brine.

235
00:37:21,412 --> 00:37:23,251
Spending too long in it

236
00:37:23,252 --> 00:37:25,852
can send an eel into toxic shock.

237
00:37:37,692 --> 00:37:40,332
Its only hope is to rise above it.

238
00:37:55,132 --> 00:37:56,772
It manages to escape.

239
00:38:05,932 --> 00:38:07,612
Others are not so lucky.

240
00:38:15,012 --> 00:38:17,332
The brine embalms their bodies...

241
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:21,731
...and the casualties of decades

242
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,132
accumulate around the margins.

243
00:38:44,132 --> 00:38:47,572
But parts of the deep are
even more hostile.

244
00:38:55,172 --> 00:38:59,131
In places, gigantic cracks stretch
for many miles

245
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:01,212
across the ocean floor...

246
00:39:16,132 --> 00:39:19,892
...canyons that plunge towards the
centre of the Earth.

247
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:32,331
Scans from survey vessels make it
possible to graphically reconstruct

248
00:39:32,332 --> 00:39:35,372
an image of this
vast submarine landscape.

249
00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:46,371
The deepest of all,
at almost seven miles,

250
00:39:46,372 --> 00:39:49,212
is the Mariana Trench
in the Pacific Ocean.

251
00:39:55,172 --> 00:39:58,532
Even Mount Everest
could disappear inside it.

252
00:40:13,732 --> 00:40:17,051
Down here, in these deep ravines,

253
00:40:17,052 --> 00:40:21,052
it was once thought that nothing
whatever could possibly survive.

254
00:40:28,212 --> 00:40:30,772
But there is life even here...

255
00:40:37,612 --> 00:40:39,172
...a kind of sea slug.

256
00:40:46,852 --> 00:40:48,852
A so-called "sea pig".

257
00:40:50,972 --> 00:40:55,171
They, and other simple creatures,
manage to survive on the

258
00:40:55,172 --> 00:40:58,652
minuscule amount of food
that drifts down here.

259
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,811
Like this starfish,

260
00:41:03,812 --> 00:41:07,771
they can withstand pressure
equivalent of 50 jumbo jets

261
00:41:07,772 --> 00:41:09,932
stacked on top of one another.

262
00:41:31,172 --> 00:41:33,531
A remote camera probe reveals

263
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,212
the most extraordinary
discovery of all...

264
00:41:43,732 --> 00:41:46,732
...the ethereal snailfish.

265
00:41:50,612 --> 00:41:52,771
At five miles down,

266
00:41:52,772 --> 00:41:56,412
this is the deepest living fish
so far discovered.

267
00:42:02,692 --> 00:42:05,491
No-one imagined that an animal as

268
00:42:05,492 --> 00:42:08,171
complex as a fish could exist

269
00:42:08,172 --> 00:42:10,172
in such extreme pressures.

270
00:42:22,372 --> 00:42:25,771
From the greatest depths to the
uppermost limit of

271
00:42:25,772 --> 00:42:30,291
the Twilight Zone, it seems that
there is nowhere in the deep sea

272
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:33,052
where life of some kind
can't survive.

273
00:42:37,892 --> 00:42:40,771
And we now think that the deep sea
may well be

274
00:42:40,772 --> 00:42:42,572
where life on Earth began.

275
00:42:56,452 --> 00:42:59,371
Here, in a world hidden within

276
00:42:59,372 --> 00:43:02,412
the greatest geological
feature on Earth...

277
00:43:06,012 --> 00:43:08,891
...running right down the middle of
the world's oceans,

278
00:43:08,892 --> 00:43:13,612
an underwater mountain range,
spanning the entire globe.

279
00:43:18,732 --> 00:43:20,452
The Mid-Ocean Ridge.

280
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,411
In the South Pacific,

281
00:43:36,412 --> 00:43:39,052
the ocean floor is being torn apart.

282
00:44:51,492 --> 00:44:54,491
Over three quarters of the planet's
volcanic activity

283
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:56,292
occurs in the deep...

284
00:45:03,652 --> 00:45:07,252
...almost all of it along the
Mid-Ocean Ridge.

285
00:45:11,252 --> 00:45:15,692
But from this titanic violence
come great riches.

286
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:28,452
Gases and scalding water gush up
through the crevices.

287
00:45:37,812 --> 00:45:42,012
Minerals condensing from these jets
build up great chimneys...

288
00:45:43,732 --> 00:45:45,412
hydrothermal vents.

289
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:51,371
This one, 30 metres tall,

290
00:45:51,372 --> 00:45:53,452
has been named Godzilla.

291
00:46:02,132 --> 00:46:04,171
Astonishingly, we now know

292
00:46:04,172 --> 00:46:06,131
that they hold as much life

293
00:46:06,132 --> 00:46:08,132
as tropical rainforests.

294
00:46:15,972 --> 00:46:19,851
In places, half a million
individual animals

295
00:46:19,852 --> 00:46:22,932
are crammed into
a single square metre.

296
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,132
They depend entirely for
their food on bacteria.

297
00:46:41,372 --> 00:46:46,132
And THEY feed on chemicals dissolved
in the searingly hot fluid.

298
00:46:53,092 --> 00:46:58,212
Crabs consume the bacterial mats
that coat their shells.

299
00:47:12,052 --> 00:47:14,891
Others maintain bacterial cultures

300
00:47:14,892 --> 00:47:17,292
actually within their bodies.

301
00:47:23,772 --> 00:47:26,772
Shrimps carry such cultures
in their mouthparts,

302
00:47:27,932 --> 00:47:30,412
but that is a strategy
fraught with danger.

303
00:47:35,132 --> 00:47:38,851
To provide sustenance
for these microbes

304
00:47:38,852 --> 00:47:42,412
the shrimps must dash
into the hot vents...

305
00:47:44,332 --> 00:47:47,132
...and that risks being boiled alive.

306
00:48:00,932 --> 00:48:02,851
In the last decade

307
00:48:02,852 --> 00:48:06,412
the number of hydrothermal vents
discovered has doubled.

308
00:48:14,372 --> 00:48:18,052
Every one has its own unique
character and community.

309
00:48:25,092 --> 00:48:28,972
But perhaps the most important one
of all is in the Atlantic.

310
00:48:30,612 --> 00:48:33,132
It has been named "The Lost City".

311
00:48:37,572 --> 00:48:40,331
Within its 60-metre towers,

312
00:48:40,332 --> 00:48:43,452
something truly extraordinary
is taking place.

313
00:48:47,452 --> 00:48:52,331
Under extremes of pressure and
temperature, hydrocarbons -

314
00:48:52,332 --> 00:48:57,331
the molecules that are the basic
component of all living things -

315
00:48:57,332 --> 00:49:00,412
are being created spontaneously.

316
00:49:12,012 --> 00:49:15,171
Indeed, many scientists now believe

317
00:49:15,172 --> 00:49:17,891
that life on Earth may have begun

318
00:49:17,892 --> 00:49:20,611
around a vent like this,

319
00:49:20,612 --> 00:49:23,372
four billion years ago.

320
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:45,331
We now know that there are deep seas

321
00:49:45,332 --> 00:49:48,252
on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.

322
00:49:55,172 --> 00:49:57,251
If life can exist under such

323
00:49:57,252 --> 00:49:59,851
extreme conditions down here,

324
00:49:59,852 --> 00:50:02,211
then surely it could exist

325
00:50:02,212 --> 00:50:04,212
somewhere out there.

326
00:50:29,452 --> 00:50:33,651
The team spent more than 1,000 hours
filming in the deep ocean,

327
00:50:33,652 --> 00:50:38,451
mostly from the research vessel
Alucia and her twin submersibles,

328
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,532
Deep Rover and Nadir.

329
00:50:45,932 --> 00:50:49,092
Their most ambitious mission
was to Antarctica,

330
00:50:50,252 --> 00:50:53,251
hoping to film life
two thirds of a mile down,

331
00:50:53,252 --> 00:50:55,092
something never attempted before.

332
00:51:00,612 --> 00:51:03,211
We honestly do not know what we're
going to find down there.

333
00:51:03,212 --> 00:51:06,571
We're going to a place that has
never been explored.

334
00:51:06,572 --> 00:51:09,251
There could be nothing,
there could be a carpet of life,

335
00:51:09,252 --> 00:51:12,092
there could be anything in between.
Who knows?

336
00:51:16,212 --> 00:51:18,452
It's a huge technical challenge.

337
00:51:25,572 --> 00:51:30,412
The water temperature here can reach
minus 1.8 Centigrade.

338
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:38,491
No-one knows for sure
how the subs will cope

339
00:51:38,492 --> 00:51:40,332
with this extreme environment.

340
00:51:46,052 --> 00:51:49,411
OK. Right, I'm going to soak it up.
OK.

341
00:51:49,412 --> 00:51:52,331
Just half an hour into the very
first dive,

342
00:51:52,332 --> 00:51:54,932
a puddle is forming
on the floor of the sub.

343
00:51:58,572 --> 00:52:00,572
Orla confirms it's seawater.

344
00:52:02,172 --> 00:52:06,171
Yeah, Roger. I'm just try to soak up
this puddle of water,

345
00:52:06,172 --> 00:52:08,332
and then see if any more comes.

346
00:52:09,332 --> 00:52:13,091
They must find the leak
and repair it fast.

347
00:52:13,092 --> 00:52:15,611
Are you going to knock that over
my...? Yeah.

348
00:52:15,612 --> 00:52:19,971
You're at 450 metres in a small
bubble and water's coming in.

349
00:52:19,972 --> 00:52:23,691
That's a half an hour straight shot
back up to the surface.

350
00:52:23,692 --> 00:52:25,651
You're kind of thinking about,

351
00:52:25,652 --> 00:52:29,252
"Are we going to fill up with water?
And if we are, there's no way out!"

352
00:52:30,492 --> 00:52:32,051
Yeah.

353
00:52:32,052 --> 00:52:35,132
The sub pilots are well drilled for
emergencies.

354
00:52:37,852 --> 00:52:40,491
Just pass them over. Yeah.

355
00:52:40,492 --> 00:52:43,452
Ralph quickly finds the flood
and fixes it.

356
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:48,651
He made it all seem absolutely
ordinary and normal and,

357
00:52:48,652 --> 00:52:51,051
"I've got this covered,
don't you worry,"

358
00:52:51,052 --> 00:52:52,812
and within 20 minutes, he did.

359
00:52:58,332 --> 00:53:01,851
The waters of the Antarctic Sound
are potentially rich

360
00:53:01,852 --> 00:53:03,612
but also treacherous.

361
00:53:05,052 --> 00:53:09,252
The Sound is ominously known as
"Iceberg Alley".

362
00:53:10,932 --> 00:53:13,851
We've got to find a place where we
can get the submarines down and up

363
00:53:13,852 --> 00:53:16,571
safely without any icebergs coming
along and bowling them over.

364
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:20,012
I've got a feeling it's going to be
a bit like a game of Space Invaders.

365
00:53:21,372 --> 00:53:23,891
A metre cube of ice weighs a tonne.

366
00:53:23,892 --> 00:53:27,691
You start sort of grinding that
around the sphere, it's delicate.

367
00:53:27,692 --> 00:53:29,572
It's like a big Faberge egg.

368
00:53:32,332 --> 00:53:36,492
One dive brings them right up to the
underside face of an iceberg.

369
00:53:39,612 --> 00:53:43,091
There are icebergs up there that are
the size of a small car, and

370
00:53:43,092 --> 00:53:47,451
then there are icebergs up there
that are the size of Hyde Park.

371
00:53:47,452 --> 00:53:48,852
Enormous.

372
00:53:50,492 --> 00:53:53,052
Conditions here
can change in an instant.

373
00:53:54,292 --> 00:53:56,372
The captain radios down to the subs.

374
00:54:00,972 --> 00:54:02,332
Yeah, Roger that.

375
00:54:03,892 --> 00:54:06,491
We've currently got a couple of big
icebergs coming down

376
00:54:06,492 --> 00:54:09,572
the channel, and it looks like
they're on a collision course.

377
00:54:12,892 --> 00:54:17,172
The impact of two icebergs colliding
overhead is clearly heard.

378
00:54:20,532 --> 00:54:22,012
That is ice.

379
00:54:24,492 --> 00:54:28,171
With icebergs colliding above and
the weather turning fast,

380
00:54:28,172 --> 00:54:29,772
the subs are quickly recalled.

381
00:54:37,452 --> 00:54:39,572
Once again
their efforts are thwarted.

382
00:54:50,652 --> 00:54:54,412
Finally, after two weeks,
conditions are just right.

383
00:54:55,532 --> 00:55:00,292
Once again the team attempt their
1,000-metre dive in Iceberg Alley.

384
00:55:04,172 --> 00:55:07,812
An hour after leaving the surface
they close in on their goal.

385
00:55:11,852 --> 00:55:13,292
999.

386
00:55:17,212 --> 00:55:18,931
Control, control.

387
00:55:18,932 --> 00:55:20,531
This is Nadir

388
00:55:20,532 --> 00:55:25,531
on bottom, depth -
one-zero-zero-zero metres.

389
00:55:25,532 --> 00:55:27,651
Roger. Depth - 1,000 metres.

390
00:55:27,652 --> 00:55:29,852
Control out. New record!

391
00:55:32,132 --> 00:55:35,772
First manned sub dive
to 1,000 metres in Antarctica!

392
00:55:37,812 --> 00:55:40,731
At the bottom of the ocean, at the
end of the world,

393
00:55:40,732 --> 00:55:43,692
the amount of life they find is
astonishing.

394
00:55:49,452 --> 00:55:52,411
But they are equally astonished
to find that,

395
00:55:52,412 --> 00:55:54,811
two thirds of a mile from the
surface,

396
00:55:54,812 --> 00:55:56,732
icebergs are still a danger.

397
00:55:58,732 --> 00:56:01,611
Rocks can drop from them
as they melt,

398
00:56:01,612 --> 00:56:04,612
and one lands
right in front of the sub.

399
00:56:07,252 --> 00:56:10,411
I don't think many people who are
diving subs

400
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:13,852
ever consider big lumps of rock
landing on them.

401
00:56:15,252 --> 00:56:17,291
It's, it's not your normal risk.

402
00:56:17,292 --> 00:56:18,771
If it had hit the sphere,

403
00:56:18,772 --> 00:56:21,771
there's a good chance it would have
put a nice scratch down it.

404
00:56:21,772 --> 00:56:25,131
If something of ten, 15, 20 tonnes
had hit the sub,

405
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:26,772
it would completely destroy it.

406
00:56:31,052 --> 00:56:33,131
But over the following dives

407
00:56:33,132 --> 00:56:36,171
the team learns it's these
very drop stones

408
00:56:36,172 --> 00:56:38,972
that enrich the Antarctic
deep sea bed,

409
00:56:40,132 --> 00:56:43,692
creating firm anchor points
for life to thrive.

410
00:56:48,372 --> 00:56:52,051
Proof that the only way to fully
appreciate the complexity and

411
00:56:52,052 --> 00:56:56,372
abundance of life in the deep
is to go there ourselves.

412
00:57:04,892 --> 00:57:08,452
Next time, we travel to bustling
coral reefs.

413
00:57:14,892 --> 00:57:19,211
Here, animals must go to
extraordinary lengths

414
00:57:19,212 --> 00:57:22,972
to get ahead of the competition in
these crowded cities.
