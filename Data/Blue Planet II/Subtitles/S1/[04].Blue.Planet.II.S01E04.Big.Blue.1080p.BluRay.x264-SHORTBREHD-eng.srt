<i>The plan is to film</i>

508
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,878
<i>the dolphins' feeding frenzy</i>
<i>from underwater.</i>

509
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,991
Several hundred dolphins
jumping all over the place,

510
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,673
it looks like this could be it.

511
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,192
<i>They catch up with the dolphins.</i>

512
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,600
<i>But they're too late.</i>

513
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,880
Oh, dear.

514
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,950
RACHEL: Nothing, Rog?

515
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,032
Nothing. Just fish scales and bones.

516
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,680
It's like turning up at a battle only to
see all the dead bodies left over.

517
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,559
<i>To stand a chance of</i>
<i>filming the dolphins feeding,</i>

518
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,360
<i>the dive team need to be more proactive.</i>

519
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,512
<i>Rachel hitches a ride,</i>
<i>following them underwater</i>

520
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,672
<i>searching for any clue</i>
<i>to where they might go next.</i>

521
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,110
(SQUEAKING)

522
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,310
<i>Finally,</i>

523
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,753
<i>after three weeks of searching,</i>

524
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,556
<i>the dive team</i>
<i>catch a huge feeding event.</i>

525
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,670
<i>A massive shoal of lanternfish</i>

526
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,631
<i>being rounded up</i>
<i>by hundreds of spinner dolphins.</i>

527
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,478
ROGER: That was incredibly intense.

528
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,279
A very large bait ball

529
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,000
spread over probably
the size of a football field.

530
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,313
Fins coming in all over your shoulder,
over your head.

531
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,550
It was incredible.

532
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,550
<i>For the first time,</i>

533
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:33,714
<i>the aerial team can record</i>
<i>the epic scale of this spectacle.</i>

534
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,838
You know, we heard these stories
of "boiling seas", but it's real.

535
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,155
They're huge.

536
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,357
<i>The vastness</i>
<i>of the ocean wilderness</i>

537
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:48,354
<i>made capturing this</i>
<i>extraordinary event a great challenge.</i>

538
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,917
<i>But this is the reward.</i>

539
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,595
<i>A moment of unparallelled drama</i>

540
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,991
<i>in the immense expanse of the big blue.</i>

541
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:09,952
<i>Next time, we journey</i>
<i>into the bountiful green sea.</i>

542
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,317
<i>These are enchanted worlds,</i>

543
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,551
<i>home to strange creatures...</i>

544
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,760
(CRUNCHING)

545
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,517
<i>... where only the most ingenious</i>
<i>will triumph.</i>
