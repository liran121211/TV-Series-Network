1
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,079
In the far north,

2
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,240
after three dark months of winter...

3
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,520
a world is waiting...

4
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,800
for a trigger.

5
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,760
The sunshine of spring.

6
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,760
Starfish are the first to respond.

7
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,280
They race for the highest point...

8
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,279
and sensing changes in the water,

9
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,840
with the tips of their tube feet...

10
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,720
they spawn.

11
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,999
Sea cucumbers,

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,439
with only their mouths exposed,

13
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,280
now emerge.

14
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,800
They collect as many
starfish eggs as they can.

15
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,280
Which is quite a lot,
when you've got ten arms.

16
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,800
Now sea pens rise up
to claim a share.

17
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,800
The creatures here must grab what
they can of this annual banquet.

18
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,520
For the light has also set in motion
the greatest transformation of all.

19
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,279
Fronds of kelp, a marine alga,

20
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,239
rise towards the surface,

21
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,120
lifted by their gas-filled bladders.

22
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,920
Soon, a marine forest
has materialised...

23
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,720
teeming with life of all kinds.

24
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,359
These green seas
are some of the most productive,

25
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,039
but fiercely competitive, waters

26
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,480
in all the oceans.

27
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,720
The southern tip of Africa.

28
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,680
Here, two great oceans collide.

29
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,199
In the shallows,
fed by rich currents,

30
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,240
are bountiful forests of kelp.

31
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,799
Barely visible except
for the pulsating siphon

32
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,559
through which it breathes,
a common octopus,

33
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,840
waiting for prey to pass by.

34
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,080
A crab will do.

35
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,240
The octopus sets off in pursuit.

36
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,680
And then lurks...

37
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,360
with the patience
of an ambush hunter.

38
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,319
But the octopus
shares the Cape waters

39
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,880
with a great concentration
of other predators.

40
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,000
Fur seals...

41
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,000
and sharks.

42
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,480
They all eat octopus...

43
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,040
if they can find one.

44
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,200
And pyjama sharks are experts...

45
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,960
at hunting in the undergrowth.

46
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,800
Time to disappear.

47
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,159
But these tough-skinned
little sharks

48
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,960
are small enough
to reach deep into crevices.

49
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,240
But the octopus
is far from finished.

50
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,560
She slips her tentacles
into the shark's gills.

51
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,200
That prevents the shark
from breathing.

52
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,120
So, the shark has to let go.

53
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,679
When caught out in the open,
and vulnerable,

54
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,560
this octopus does something
truly extraordinary...

55
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,840
and never recorded before.

56
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,240
She disguises herself...

57
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,360
with a protective armour
of shells.

58
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,720
She's hiding... in plain sight.

59
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,120
The shark can sense its prey...

60
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,440
but the shells confuse it.

61
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,719
In a forest full of hungry mouths,

62
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,560
superior wits
allow this octopus to stay alive.

63
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,720
Forests of kelp flourish in
seasonal waters around the globe...

64
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,960
particularly along the
Pacific Coast of North America.

65
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,199
Here, the biggest kelps of all

66
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,159
grow in vast forests,

67
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,280
stretching for hundreds of miles.

68
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,479
In some places, the giant fronds

69
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,520
rise up to 60 metres tall.

70
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,360
The thickets they create
are crowded with life.

71
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,560
Competition here,
for space and food, is intense.

72
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,360
A challenging problem
for the Garibaldi fish.

73
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,079
He tends to his patch of seaweed,

74
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,040
filled with tiny creatures
that he eats.

75
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,000
As with most farmers,
his work never ends.

76
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,279
He removes snails
and any other grazers

77
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,560
that come to eat his algae...

78
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,520
no matter how big they are.

79
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,400
He has to deal
with pests of all kinds.

80
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,519
This can be the worst of them -

81
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,160
sea urchins that can scrape off
every vestige of algae from a rock.

82
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,960
Its spines are needle-sharp.

83
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,880
Somehow, the Garibaldi
must remove it.

84
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,080
But the problem with sea urchins...

85
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,200
is that they just keep coming.

86
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,199
When evening arrives
and the light fades, he has to stop.

87
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,960
He not only needs a rest,
he needs to hide.

88
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,960
Because at night, predators prowl
through these forests.

89
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,239
A torpedo ray,

90
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,920
capable of stunning its victim
with 45 volts of electricity.

91
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,840
While the Garibaldi hides...

92
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,160
the urchins
can feed without interruption.

93
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,240
The light returns...

94
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,760
and he finds his farm is
once again under attack.

95
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,159
Urchins, like locusts,

96
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,360
have the ability to swarm.

97
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,879
And this can be disastrous,
not just for the Garibaldi,

98
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,040
but for the kelp forest itself.

99
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,960
All the vegetation
is now under attack.

100
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,319
The urchins move through the forest,

101
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,999
cutting through the kelp fronds

102
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,840
and leaving behind vast barrens.

103
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,359
These urchin armies
have felled many kelp forests

104
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,200
along the Pacific Coast
of North America.

105
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,760
But help is at hand.

106
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,360
Sea otters.

107
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,599
All other kinds of otters
spend much of their lives on land,

108
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,560
but sea otters
rarely leave the water.

109
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,799
At first, a newly-born pup
is not a very good swimmer,

110
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,520
so its mother spends hours
grooming its fur to make it buoyant.

111
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,479
But to provide her youngster
with milk and keep herself warm,

112
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,640
she must eat up to 30%
of her body weight every day.

113
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,120
She does that by eating shellfish.

114
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,760
And urchins are among a sea otter's
favourite delicacies.

115
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,999
In the past, sea otters were hunted
so intensively for their fur

116
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,240
that they came close to extinction.

117
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:31,760
With them gone, many kelp forests
were replaced with urchin barrens.

118
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,920
Today, sea otters are protected...

119
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,079
and as their numbers
slowly return,

120
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,240
many of the kelp forests
are recovering, too.

121
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,519
Now, in some remote places,

122
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,359
sea otters are so numerous

123
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,040
they assemble in huge rafts...

124
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,040
something that hasn't been
seen for over a century.

125
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,560
In the sun-drenched shallows
off Australia...

126
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,039
kelp is replaced by
the sea's only flowering plants,

127
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,160
sea grass.

128
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,679
The most extensive of these
marine grasslands

129
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,080
can stretch
for over 3,000 square miles.

130
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,000
All across the tropics,
they're patrolled by tiger sharks.

131
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,720
They can grow up
to five metres in length...

132
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,840
and have powerful crushing jaws.

133
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,280
Green turtles are their prey.

134
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,440
The turtles feed almost
entirely on sea grass.

135
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,960
A single one can consume
up to two kilos of it in a day.

136
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,520
But they can never rest easy.

137
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,800
Healthy turtles will keep well away
from an approaching shark.

138
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,679
And just by keeping
the turtles on the move,

139
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,640
the sharks prevent any one patch
of sea grass from being overgrazed.

140
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,040
And that has benefits for us all.

141
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,199
A patch of sea grass
can absorb and store

142
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,799
35 times as much carbon dioxide

143
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,160
as the same area of a rainforest.

144
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,719
So, the prairies and their sharks
are surprising allies

145
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,400
in the fight against
a warming climate.

146
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,079
The struggle to survive
in our green seas

147
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,480
can have far-reaching consequences.

148
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:36,200
Once a year, one particular meadow
in Australia is transformed.

149
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,799
Around the first full moon
of winter,

150
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,000
an army materialises.

151
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,240
Spider crabs.

152
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,600
For the past year, they've
been feeding in deeper waters.

153
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,720
Now they march
across the sea-grass plains.

154
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,640
Hundreds of thousands of them.

155
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,560
They clamber over one another...

156
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,720
creating great mounds...

157
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,840
nearly 100 metres long...

158
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,879
They're not seeking mates,
neither are they laying eggs.

159
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,799
They have come here in order...

160
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,240
to grow.

161
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,199
Like all crabs,

162
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,959
their bodies are enclosed

163
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,800
in a hard, un-expandable shell.

164
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,560
So, to grow,
they have to break out of it...

165
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:51,640
and that allows the soft one that
has developed beneath to expand.

166
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,920
It will take days
for the new shell to harden.

167
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,040
Its legs are so limp
that they won't work properly.

168
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,440
The crab is unprotected
and in great danger.

169
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,520
A smooth stingray.

170
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,120
It's huge - about four metres long.

171
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,559
It wants a soft,
freshly-moulted crab

172
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,680
that will be easier to eat.

173
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,480
The crabs try to stick together.

174
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,759
But now, disturbed by the ray,

175
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,240
they're scattering.

176
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,399
A newly-moulted crab

177
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,440
is too weak to keep up
with the crowd.

178
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,640
The safest place is right
in the middle of the pile.

179
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,760
That is why they have
all assembled here.

180
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,680
There is safety in numbers.

181
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,280
The vast majority
of the crabs escape...

182
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,079
and within the next few days,

183
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,919
they will be ready to return
to the depths

184
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,200
and resume their lonely wanderings
in search of food.

185
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,560
This is no graveyard...

186
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,480
but the triumph of a 100,000 crabs
successfully moulted.

187
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,679
The green seas of Southern Australia

188
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,200
are particularly rich
in such spectacular assemblies...

189
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,599
but most of the creatures
come together

190
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,760
for a very different reason.

191
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,600
To breed.

192
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,959
The giant cuttlefish,

193
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,560
the largest of all cuttlefish.

194
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,880
They live for just one or two years.

195
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,519
Now, as the Australian summer draws
to an end,

196
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,280
they have one last act to complete.

197
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,920
To find a mate.

198
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,439
But there are over 100,000 males,

199
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,560
competing for the arriving females
in this one bay.

200
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,599
Among them a giant - a true Goliath.

201
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,000
He probably weighs about ten kilos.

202
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,239
Bands of colour
sweep across his skin.

203
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,120
That's how cuttlefish communicate.

204
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,480
This smaller male
couldn't possibly take him on.

205
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,599
Beside Goliath,
and under his protection,

206
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,160
a female who has just
mated with him.

207
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,560
But other rivals
are still interested.

208
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,040
It seems a small male
wouldn't stand a chance.

209
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,599
The female is now displaying
a white stripe

210
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,040
along her side nearest Goliath.

211
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,800
It's a clear signal that she no
longer wants to mate with him.

212
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,880
It's all the encouragement
that the little male needs.

213
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,200
He's going to have to use trickery.

214
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,999
He tones down his colours

215
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,720
and tucks in his arms.

216
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,600
He's just the right size
to mimic a female.

217
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,960
Goliath is deceived.

218
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,559
The small male
now displays a white stripe,

219
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,920
just like the real female,
to deter his advances.

220
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,960
He slips beside her...

221
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,800
and they mate.

222
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,360
By mating with multiple partners...

223
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,600
the female ensures the greatest
genetic diversity for her young.

224
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,799
The sneaky male leaves,

225
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,640
his final act complete.

226
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,680
So, even among giant cuttlefish,
it seems...

227
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,840
it's not all about size.

228
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,399
Other males in these
Australian green pastures,

229
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,840
take greater responsibility
for their young.

230
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,160
A weedy sea dragon.

231
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,400
This is a male and he's carrying
a precious cargo.

232
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,439
While mating with the female,

233
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,160
he collected the eggs
and attached them to his underside.

234
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,800
Now, he's leaving these
seaweed thickets...

235
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,999
and travelling
into more open waters

236
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,280
where elaborate camouflage
is less effective.

237
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,280
And there are many
predators out here.

238
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,280
And this is what the fathers
risk their lives for.

239
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,760
Dense clouds of minute shrimp.

240
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:30,920
Mysids, one of a sea dragon's
favourite foods.

241
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,200
They're drawing other
sea dragons out here, too.

242
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,960
Finally, it's time
for the young to break free.

243
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,680
But algae has grown over
these developing eggs...

244
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,720
and it risks smothering them.

245
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,440
Nonetheless,
the babies are emerging.

246
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,520
They've hatched successfully.

247
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,919
The fathers return
to the tangle of kelp,

248
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,920
where they're virtually invisible...

249
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,520
while the young remain out here.

250
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,279
But they will grow quickly,

251
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,640
surrounded as they are
by their ideal food.

252
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,479
Vast numbers
of the oceans' young fish

253
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,360
start their lives in the green seas.

254
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:43,880
One of the richest nurseries
of all are the mangrove forests.

255
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,559
Fringing the coastline
of the tropics,

256
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,680
they form a natural protective
barrier between land and sea...

257
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,120
and are some of the world's
most productive forests.

258
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,079
Below the water,
their arching aerial roots

259
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,240
give them a firm footing.

260
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,320
Here, there's abundant food
for baby fish.

261
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,319
While the tangled roots protect
them from bigger fish

262
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,760
and other predators
that haunt the channels.

263
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,239
But in Northern Australia,

264
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,720
with the receding tide...

265
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,520
the little fish are forced
to leave their shelter.

266
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,960
And now, they are vulnerable.

267
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,080
It's the most deadly assassin
in the green seas.

268
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,159
The zebra mantis shrimp -

269
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,640
a male, almost 40 centimetres long.

270
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,600
But he's not hunting
just for himself.

271
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,280
He's collecting food for his mate.

272
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,080
She may have been his partner
for 20 years.

273
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,120
She relies on him
to bring her food...

274
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,000
and puts her energy
into her eggs instead.

275
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,039
In a world so full of food,

276
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,800
this would seem a sensible strategy.

277
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,640
But it's also a risky one.

278
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,039
Were her male to disappear,

279
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,240
she could starve.

280
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,360
Something has caught
this male's attention.

281
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,360
Perhaps an irresistible odour...

282
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,440
or a distant call.

283
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,439
Whatever the reason,

284
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,319
a male will leave his burrow

285
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,920
and his lifelong mate.

286
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,280
An even larger hole.

287
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,039
Females who have lost their mates

288
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,840
appear to send out distress signals
to call in a new male.

289
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,479
A larger female
will produce more eggs.

290
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,000
So by mating with her,
he will father more offspring.

291
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,320
But infidelity comes at a price.

292
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,560
A larger partner demands more food.

293
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,040
The richer a sea,
the greater the competition..

294
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,599
And there is one green sea

295
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:13,160
that supports more life
than all the rest combined.

296
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,159
Unlike the mangrove forests
and the sea-grass prairies,

297
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,399
its location is in the open seas

298
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,920
and only temporary
and unpredictable.

299
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,240
This greenness comes
not from rooted plants...

300
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,280
but from clouds of floating ones.

301
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,360
Billions of microscopic
phytoplankton are proliferating.

302
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:05,520
And in such numbers that they fuel
one of the greatest feasts of all.

303
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,519
Off America's Pacific Coast,

304
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,960
hundreds of common dolphins
are rushing to a banquet.

305
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,480
They're not the only ones homing in.

306
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,680
So are sea lions.

307
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,799
They're heading
for Monterey Bay, California,

308
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,039
where algal blooms have caused
an explosion

309
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,600
in plankton feeders.

310
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:01,440
Anchovies - millions of them.

311
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,520
The dolphins herd the anchovies
towards the surface.

312
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:19,000
Sea birds and sea lions take
advantage of the shoal's appearance.

313
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,800
It's a race to grab a share
before others arrive.

314
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,799
Humpback whales,

315
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,000
hundreds of them.

316
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,199
With every upward lunge,

317
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,880
they sieve out up to 100 kilos
of fish.

318
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,759
They're claiming the biggest share

319
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,640
of one of the biggest feasts
on Earth.

320
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,639
So crucial are these tiny plankton,

321
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,640
that almost all marine life
ultimately depends upon them.

322
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,560
It's the green seas, not the blue...

323
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:27,560
that are the basis of almost
all life in the world's oceans.

324
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,479
To capture the magnificence
of the undersea forests

325
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,759
and the surprising creatures living
here, the Blue Planet II team

326
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,960
have developed a series
of specialist camera rigs.

327
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,639
From the mega-dome
recording half-in-half-out shots

328
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,760
at the top of the towering canopy...

329
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,159
to state-of-the-art
time-lapse equipment

330
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,760
that speeds up time to reveal
the secret life of the forest floor.

331
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,999
But, of all the creatures
living in these forests,

332
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,359
filming one in the waters
off the Cape of South Africa

333
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,680
was to prove
the greatest challenge of all.

334
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,999
Naturalist Craig Foster
has developed a fascination

335
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,080
for its most secretive resident,
a common octopus.

336
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,879
There are almost 100 species
of shark in these waters,

337
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,839
but that doesn't deter Craig,

338
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:44,360
who's swum here every morning
for the past six years.

339
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,639
When you find that really small,
tiny, little oval hole,

340
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,560
then you know it's
been killed by an octopus.

341
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,919
And then if you look very,
very carefully,

342
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,400
they're often
in the vicinity of that.

343
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,759
Craig has witnessed
the antics of these octopuses

344
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,039
and wants to share
his remarkable discoveries

345
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,600
with Blue Planet cameraman
Roger Horrocks.

346
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:34,440
Roger is immediately charmed by
the strength of their personalities.

347
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,239
It's really been astounding to see
how individual these characters are.

348
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,800
The common octopus all display
different behaviours.

349
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,279
Some were extremely timid,

350
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,359
some were very, very bold,

351
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,080
they have variety
and it's really endeared me to them.

352
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,879
After weeks of filming
different individuals,

353
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,799
they finally meet one octopus

354
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,999
that's not only seemingly
unafraid of the camera,

355
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,040
but willing to perform for it.

356
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,079
She just came right up - whoop!

357
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,239
And then came right through
underneath the tripod

358
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,639
in between my legs.

359
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,759
Yeah, that's cool, amazing.

360
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,879
She very quickly just completely
accepted both of us.

361
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,679
So, we've actually been getting
these really intimate behaviours.

362
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,400
It's amazing.

363
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,599
I've watched this octopus
for many months,

364
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,199
it's just trusting us in the water,

365
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,680
carrying on with normal activity
which is just so fantastic.

366
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:59,440
Months later, the team finally film
their star octopus on the hunt.

367
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,999
But then discover the grave
consequences of sharing the forest

368
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,879
with so many other predators -

369
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,440
pyjama sharks.

370
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,719
Pound for pound,
these sharks are far more brazen

371
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,559
and aggressive than a Great White.

372
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,719
They're like guided missiles.

373
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,520
The slightest smell that octopus
gives off, that shark will find it.

374
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,879
The pyjama shark
actually got hold of the octopus

375
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,680
and, I mean,
I just assumed that was it.

376
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,439
After spending
so much time with this animal,

377
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,560
it was just so difficult
watching her get attacked.

378
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,400
Then, to their amazement,
she fights back!

379
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,799
She put her tentacles down,

380
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,079
you can see them coming through
the gill, basically,

381
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,359
closed the mouth.
The shark couldn't breathe,

382
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,639
and that's what enabled
her to escape.

383
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,479
And just witnessing
that whole thing was,

384
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,920
you know, it was an
incredibly intense moment.

385
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,200
The team are relieved by her escape.

386
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,199
But when caught out in the open,

387
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,040
her next trick astonishes them
even more.

388
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,799
It lifted its arms and legs
over its head,

389
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,359
and, at the same time,
pulled the shell material with it

390
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,440
and created
this extraordinary armoury.

391
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,119
Octopus had armoured up
and then, when that guy came

392
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,279
through from the back,
he could kind of smell something.

393
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,239
He's not seeing an octopus shape,

394
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,559
he's seeing that strange armoury.

395
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,999
Then he was bumping the octopus,

396
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,039
and it was just incredible
to see how that octopus

397
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,239
outwitted that shark
using the armour,

398
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,319
using all his, his knowledge,

399
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,080
it's just... absolutely phenomenal.

400
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,160
She's a rock star, man.
A proper little rock star.

401
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,239
Thanks to Craig's and
Roger's dedication,

402
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,920
the octopuses' astonishing
behaviours are now known to science.

403
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,679
What else might we find
as we continue to explore

404
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:54,160
these fascinating undersea forests?

405
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,159
Next time on Blue Planet II...

406
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,280
we meet the creatures that live
where two worlds collide...

407
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,639
and discover how they cope with
the demands

408
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,320
of the ever-changing coasts.
