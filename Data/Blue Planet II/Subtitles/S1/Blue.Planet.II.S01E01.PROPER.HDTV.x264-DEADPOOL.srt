00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:30,452
The oceans seemingly limitless,

3
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:35,892
invoke in us a sense of awe and
wonder and also sometimes fear.

4
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:39,892
They cover 70% of the surface
of our planet,

5
00:00:40,252 --> 00:00:43,692
and yet they are still
the least explored.

6
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:49,212
Hidden beneath the waves
right beneath my feet,

7
00:00:49,652 --> 00:00:52,732
there are creatures
beyond our imagination.

8
00:01:08,172 --> 00:01:11,892
With revolutionary technology,
we can enter new worlds...

9
00:01:18,092 --> 00:01:19,772
...and shine the light on behaviours

10
00:01:19,852 --> 00:01:23,012
in ways that were impossible
just a generation ago.

11
00:01:27,012 --> 00:01:29,652
We've also recognized
an uncomfortable fact.

12
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:32,572
The health of our ocean
is under threat.

13
00:01:32,932 --> 00:01:36,652
They're changing at a faster rate
than ever before in human history.

14
00:01:43,332 --> 00:01:46,052
Never has there been
a more crucial time

15
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:50,572
to reveal what is going on
beneath the surface of the seas.

16
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:07,572
In this first episode,

17
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:14,532
we will journey across the globe
from the warm waters of the tropics

18
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:20,372
to the coldest around the poles.

19
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:29,332
To bring us a new understanding
of live beneath the waves.

20
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:38,292
This is Blue Planet II.

21
00:03:37,252 --> 00:03:42,372
The surface of the ocean conceals
the many creatures that live beneath

22
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:57,132
but not all.

23
00:03:59,852 --> 00:04:01,612
Bottlenose dolphins.

24
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:07,412
They're extremely intelligent.

25
00:04:17,652 --> 00:04:21,332
And with this intelligence
comes playfulness.

26
00:04:28,212 --> 00:04:29,612
They surf.

27
00:04:31,212 --> 00:04:36,252
And as far as we can tell,
they do so for the sheer joy of it.

28
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:07,052
But to properly appreciate
their true character,

29
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:12,612
you have to travel with them
into their world.

30
00:05:25,812 --> 00:05:30,932
A pod of bottlenose dolphins is
visiting a coral reef in the Red Sea.

31
00:05:33,452 --> 00:05:36,812
For the youngsters,
there are things to be learned here.

32
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:50,772
The adults lead a calf
to a particular bush-like coral

33
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:53,532
called a Gorgonian.

34
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:10,612
And here, the adults behave
rather strangely.

35
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:20,292
They deliberately rub themselves
through the fronds.

36
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:36,212
Their calf seems reluctant to do so.

37
00:06:48,772 --> 00:06:50,252
By watching his elders,

38
00:06:50,332 --> 00:06:54,332
he may be realizing that this
is something he ought to do.

39
00:07:01,092 --> 00:07:04,812
Gorgonia fronds, in fact,
are covered with a mucous

40
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:09,532
that can have anti-inflammatory
and antimicrobial properties.

41
00:07:14,252 --> 00:07:17,092
So maybe the adult dolphins
are doing this

42
00:07:17,172 --> 00:07:19,292
to protect themselves from infection.

43
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:32,212
The dolphins' intimate knowledge
of the reef

44
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:38,692
is spurring us to search
for new medicines here, too.

45
00:07:47,972 --> 00:07:49,572
Tropical coral reefs

46
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:53,772
occupy only a tenth of one percent
of the ocean floor.

47
00:07:56,492 --> 00:08:00,812
But their shallow warm waters
and stable year round conditions,

48
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:04,492
support some of the most crowded
and varied communities

49
00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:07,172
to be found anywhere in the oceans.

50
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:14,212
And there are new discoveries to
be made on every one of them.

51
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:38,372
One creature
on Australia's Great Barrier Reef

52
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:42,852
is challenging our understanding
of fish intelligence.

53
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:44,892
A tusk fish.

54
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:47,892
And you can see why it gets its name.

55
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:57,172
He does something few would
have believed a fish could do.

56
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:07,732
Every morning,
he travels to the edge of the reef.

57
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,772
He's searching
for something special to eat

58
00:09:24,852 --> 00:09:27,332
amongst the coral and sand.

59
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:39,812
Here's one.

60
00:09:41,892 --> 00:09:43,412
A small clam.

61
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:54,172
But how to crack it open
and get to the meat?

62
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,492
He takes it all the way back

63
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:10,172
to his special kitchen.

64
00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:20,692
A bowl-shaped coral

65
00:10:21,132 --> 00:10:25,812
that has a particular bump on
the inside that he always uses.

66
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,612
It's not easy if you have no hands.

67
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:55,892
Whoops.

68
00:10:56,972 --> 00:10:58,412
There he goes again.

69
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:05,172
But he's got great determination

70
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:13,532
and surprising accuracy.

71
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:34,372
At last.

72
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:40,452
So here is a fish that uses tools.

73
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,812
Some fish are much cleverer
than you might suppose.

74
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:06,772
The density of the animals
on tropical reefs

75
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,412
makes competition
inevitable and extreme.

76
00:12:11,572 --> 00:12:14,612
Not only for those that lived
within the reef,

77
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:18,372
but for the birds
that fly above them.

78
00:12:21,812 --> 00:12:23,452
During the dry season,

79
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:25,932
over half a million terns

80
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:29,532
crowd onto this remote atoll
in the Indian Ocean.

81
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:40,932
Their chicks are still
in their dark, juvenile plumage.

82
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:47,332
They vary in age.

83
00:12:55,772 --> 00:12:59,012
Whilst the more advanced chicks
take to the air,

84
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:08,652
others aren't quite ready yet.

85
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:31,772
Those just starting to learn to fly

86
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:35,652
use the shallow lagoon
that occupies the centre of the atoll

87
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,452
as their training ground.

88
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:43,692
It's difficult for some of them
to stay aloft for long.

89
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:09,252
Giant trevallies.

90
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:25,292
Usually, they're solitary hunters,

91
00:14:25,492 --> 00:14:29,492
but about 50 of them have come here
from neighbouring reefs

92
00:14:29,612 --> 00:14:33,092
attracted by this abundance
of potential prey.

93
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:44,172
The fledglings stay out of the water
if they can,

94
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:48,132
they even drink on the wing.

95
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,332
If the trevally are to catch one now,

96
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:11,252
they have to up their game.

97
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:24,172
So there is a fish
here that amazingly

98
00:15:24,252 --> 00:15:28,332
has a brain capable of calculating
the airspeed,

99
00:15:28,412 --> 00:15:31,612
altitude and trajectory of a bird.

100
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:06,892
The time comes when every fledgling
has to take to the air

101
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:09,052
and collect food for itself.

102
00:16:32,772 --> 00:16:36,332
Their parents lead them
to the training grounds.

103
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:12,812
If they're to survive,

104
00:18:13,452 --> 00:18:15,052
they must learn quickly.

105
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:26,692
After a month of practising
over the lagoon,

106
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:28,652
the youngsters start to leave

107
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,772
and take their chances
out over the open sea.

108
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:44,612
The oceans hold 97% of all the water
in the world.

109
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,892
As the sun warms their surface,
water evaporates.

110
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:53,932
The vapour rises into the sky

111
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:57,852
until it cools and condenses
into towering clouds.

112
00:19:00,612 --> 00:19:03,932
And they generate huge storms.

113
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:11,092
The spin of the earth
deflects these storms

114
00:19:11,172 --> 00:19:14,372
north and south into
cooler latitudes.

115
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:24,932
As they travel across the sea,

116
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:29,172
storm-driven winds
create huge swells.

117
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:43,732
When the swells reach
shallower waters,

118
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:47,492
they rise into gigantic waves.

119
00:20:04,892 --> 00:20:09,212
In its lifetime,
a large storm can release energy

120
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:13,372
that is the equivalent
of 10,000 nuclear bombs.

121
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:40,972
These are the seasonal seas.

122
00:20:44,012 --> 00:20:45,772
And when they warm in spring,

123
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,852
they can suddenly explode with life.

124
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:07,812
Mobula rays have gathered
in Mexico's Sea of Cortez

125
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:09,612
in vast numbers.

126
00:21:17,052 --> 00:21:18,372
Why do they leap?

127
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:23,452
Is it to tell others
that they're here?

128
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:28,412
No one knows.

129
00:21:31,852 --> 00:21:34,292
They feed mostly at night

130
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:39,412
for that is when vast swarms
of plankton rise from the depths.

131
00:21:45,492 --> 00:21:47,487
The disturbance in the water...

132
00:21:47,512 --> 00:21:51,716
stimulates many of the planktonic
creatures to luminesce.

133
00:21:53,252 --> 00:21:58,172
Only now do we have the technology
to record their faint glow.

134
00:22:07,212 --> 00:22:09,652
The feasting rays swim through them

135
00:22:09,732 --> 00:22:14,172
creating an extraordinary ballet
of life and death.

136
00:23:02,372 --> 00:23:06,812
The richness of these waters
is based on microscopic plants,

137
00:23:07,172 --> 00:23:08,572
phytoplankton,

138
00:23:08,892 --> 00:23:13,172
which bloom on such a massive scale
they benefit us all.

139
00:23:16,492 --> 00:23:19,932
They, together with seaweeds
and seagrasses,

140
00:23:20,092 --> 00:23:21,852
produce as much oxygen

141
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:25,812
as all the forests
and grassy plains on land.

142
00:23:37,052 --> 00:23:39,412
Every spring off New Zealand,

143
00:23:39,492 --> 00:23:43,212
the seasonal bounty
draws in rare visitors.

144
00:23:51,652 --> 00:23:53,652
False killer whales.

145
00:23:57,252 --> 00:23:59,172
They're relatives of the orca,

146
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:02,452
six metres long
and weighing over a tonne.

147
00:24:11,372 --> 00:24:14,572
They appear to be searching
for dolphins.

148
00:24:17,732 --> 00:24:20,812
And there are many
in these coastal waters.

149
00:24:30,332 --> 00:24:33,052
Here, bottlenose
dolphins stick together

150
00:24:33,132 --> 00:24:36,292
constantly chattering
with whistles and clicks.

151
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:49,132
Such a din carries for
miles underwater.

152
00:24:55,212 --> 00:24:57,772
The false killers have detected them.

153
00:25:20,932 --> 00:25:24,652
Travelling at ten knots,
the killers quickly close in on them.

154
00:25:42,572 --> 00:25:46,412
But then, something truly
extraordinary happens.

155
00:25:52,132 --> 00:25:54,012
The dolphins turn

156
00:25:55,172 --> 00:25:58,012
as if to greet their pursuers.

157
00:26:05,972 --> 00:26:08,372
They seem to change their course.

158
00:26:10,372 --> 00:26:13,652
Could it be that they're attempting
to communicate?

159
00:26:23,172 --> 00:26:26,132
Scientists studying
this annual encounter,

160
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:30,092
now think that individuals
may recognize one another.

161
00:26:33,572 --> 00:26:37,492
Almost unbelievably,
it seems that these different species

162
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:39,612
appear to be old friends.

163
00:26:47,092 --> 00:26:50,572
Together they're gathering
as one unified army

164
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,612
up to a thousand strong.

165
00:27:00,372 --> 00:27:04,612
This formidable hunting party
now harvests the riches

166
00:27:04,852 --> 00:27:06,972
that come with New Zealand's summer.

167
00:27:29,612 --> 00:27:32,132
All across the higher latitudes,

168
00:27:32,372 --> 00:27:36,092
seasonal seas flourish
under the summer sun.

169
00:27:39,212 --> 00:27:42,692
Here in Alaska,
sea otters lounge in the canopy

170
00:27:42,772 --> 00:27:45,172
of great submarine forests.

171
00:27:52,252 --> 00:27:59,212
Giant kelp, the biggest seaweed of
all is home to all kinds of life.

172
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:05,052
On the forest floor, spiny
sea urchins munch through the kelp.

173
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:11,092
Elsewhere there are continuously
hungry sea cucumbers

174
00:28:14,732 --> 00:28:16,692
And in the tangled undergrowth,

175
00:28:16,812 --> 00:28:20,212
wonderfully camouflaged sea dragons.

176
00:28:30,612 --> 00:28:34,212
In the underwater forests
of northern Japan,

177
00:28:35,332 --> 00:28:37,332
the residents of this sunken wreck

178
00:28:37,412 --> 00:28:42,452
are waiting for the summer temperatures
to reach 16 degrees Celsius.

179
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:58,172
That for some is the time for mating.

180
00:29:11,852 --> 00:29:14,932
A kind of giant wrasse
called a Kobudai.

181
00:29:22,212 --> 00:29:23,652
This is a male.

182
00:29:28,452 --> 00:29:32,292
And in female terms,
he's particularly handsome.

183
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:44,452
He's a metre long and
weighs 15 kilos.

184
00:29:47,292 --> 00:29:50,452
Much larger than the
diminutive female,

185
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:56,732
and he is ready to breed.

186
00:29:59,892 --> 00:30:01,492
He attempts to mate with her

187
00:30:02,852 --> 00:30:07,212
and with any of the dozen or so
females that live in his territory,

188
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:10,692
whenever he gets the chance.

189
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:28,292
But females from around ten years old

190
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:31,412
take little notice of his advances.

191
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:03,572
This is because when any large female
reaches a critical body size,

192
00:31:04,092 --> 00:31:07,492
she can begin a dramatic
transformation.

193
00:31:25,012 --> 00:31:26,772
Over just a few months,

194
00:31:26,892 --> 00:31:31,132
particular enzymes inside her body
cease to work,

195
00:31:33,132 --> 00:31:36,772
and male hormones start to circulate.

196
00:31:40,772 --> 00:31:42,372
As time passes,

197
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,292
her head expands

198
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:47,892
and her chin gets longer.

199
00:31:50,932 --> 00:31:54,852
A she has changed into a he.

200
00:32:04,292 --> 00:32:07,212
And with this comes a change
in temperament.

201
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:16,892
The old male who rules
all the females here

202
00:32:19,092 --> 00:32:21,532
is challenged to a face off.

203
00:32:27,772 --> 00:32:29,812
The more bulbous the head,

204
00:32:30,332 --> 00:32:33,412
the more it intimidates an opponent.

205
00:32:59,972 --> 00:33:02,732
The territory has a new ruler.

206
00:33:15,132 --> 00:33:19,332
Only the largest females transform
themselves in this way.

207
00:33:24,972 --> 00:33:28,332
But the change enables them
to have more mates,

208
00:33:28,652 --> 00:33:32,612
so they will have many more offspring
carrying their genes.

209
00:33:38,612 --> 00:33:41,212
But a new male can't afford
to be complacent.

210
00:33:43,932 --> 00:33:47,252
Inside the body of
every Kobudai female,

211
00:33:48,132 --> 00:33:50,892
there is a new male in waiting.

212
00:34:10,412 --> 00:34:15,292
The closer we travel towards the
poles, the colder the seas become.

213
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:20,412
Icebergs appear.

214
00:34:20,532 --> 00:34:23,212
Huge slabs that have broken away

215
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:25,332
from glaciers that are sliding
into the sea.

216
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:30,692
And then the surface
starts to freeze.

217
00:34:40,932 --> 00:34:44,052
While the lights of the aurora
play above,

218
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:46,132
even in the depths of midwinter,

219
00:34:46,732 --> 00:34:50,252
there are a few places
well north of the Arctic circle

220
00:34:50,372 --> 00:34:51,812
that are still open.

221
00:35:02,932 --> 00:35:06,612
The fjords of northern Norway
remain ice free

222
00:35:06,692 --> 00:35:09,572
because a giant current,
the Gulf Stream,

223
00:35:09,652 --> 00:35:11,532
flows up here from the south

224
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:14,732
bringing warmth all the way
from the Caribbean.

225
00:35:18,612 --> 00:35:20,092
And every winter,

226
00:35:20,172 --> 00:35:23,532
billions of herring
come here for shelter.

227
00:35:27,532 --> 00:35:29,172
And following them...

228
00:35:31,732 --> 00:35:32,932
...Orca.

229
00:35:44,932 --> 00:35:47,252
There are up to a thousand of them.

230
00:35:49,052 --> 00:35:53,252
It's possibly the greatest gathering
of orca on the planet.

231
00:36:03,092 --> 00:36:07,252
The herring maybe plentiful
but in these winding fjords

232
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,092
they're not always
easy to track down.

233
00:36:14,492 --> 00:36:16,772
These particular orca, however,

234
00:36:17,172 --> 00:36:19,572
are fish hunting specialists.

235
00:36:28,652 --> 00:36:29,892
They work as a team,

236
00:36:30,012 --> 00:36:34,492
coordinating their approach
by calling loudly to one another.

237
00:36:39,612 --> 00:36:43,212
They herd the herring
into tighter and tighter shoals.

238
00:36:58,172 --> 00:36:59,732
They swim below them,

239
00:36:59,812 --> 00:37:02,292
trapping them against
the surface of the sea.

240
00:37:11,132 --> 00:37:14,892
And now the orca deploy
their special weapon.

241
00:37:20,172 --> 00:37:23,132
They beat their tails
with such force,

242
00:37:23,252 --> 00:37:26,052
that the shock waves
stun the herring.

243
00:37:28,732 --> 00:37:32,812
And then the senseless victims
are easily collected.

244
00:38:06,772 --> 00:38:10,652
But all this underwater noise
attracts others.

245
00:38:18,492 --> 00:38:20,212
Humpback whales.

246
00:38:21,812 --> 00:38:24,252
They move in on the action.

247
00:38:32,532 --> 00:38:36,532
They approach the shoal from beneath
and then lunge upwards,

248
00:38:42,892 --> 00:38:47,252
gathering up to a hundred kilos
of herring in a single mouthful.

249
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:08,932
The humpbacks are
comparative newcomers.

250
00:39:09,852 --> 00:39:13,212
They only started coming here
within the last decade.

251
00:39:24,212 --> 00:39:27,172
But these polars seas are so rich

252
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:30,092
that there appears to be enough food
for everyone.

253
00:39:52,332 --> 00:39:55,572
Nonetheless, few if
any of these riches

254
00:39:55,692 --> 00:39:59,132
would be here were it not
for the Gulf Stream.

255
00:40:08,212 --> 00:40:12,852
Ocean currents, in fact, are crucial
to the well being of our planet.

256
00:40:17,852 --> 00:40:20,972
They distribute the sun's heat
towards the poles

257
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:22,652
all the way from the equator,

258
00:40:25,212 --> 00:40:29,572
maintaining a climate favourable
for life almost everywhere.

259
00:40:36,092 --> 00:40:39,292
From creating the weather
to producing oxygen,

260
00:40:39,372 --> 00:40:42,172
the seas keep our world healthy.

261
00:40:51,332 --> 00:40:53,772
But there are now worrying signs

262
00:40:53,892 --> 00:40:55,452
that conditions in the oceans

263
00:40:55,532 --> 00:40:58,332
that have remained relatively stable
for millennia

264
00:40:58,732 --> 00:41:00,532
are changing radically.

265
00:41:02,412 --> 00:41:05,932
Nowhere is this more evident
than in the Arctic.

266
00:41:08,172 --> 00:41:10,132
Here in the past 30 years,

267
00:41:10,252 --> 00:41:14,852
the extent of the ice in summer
has been reduced by 40%.

268
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:17,692
This sudden warming,

269
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:20,652
most likely a consequence
of human activity,

270
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:24,732
is having a profound impact
on its wildlife.

271
00:41:31,652 --> 00:41:35,572
Walruses are among those
that are seriously affected.

272
00:41:44,972 --> 00:41:48,852
Every adult female
needs to find a safe place

273
00:41:49,252 --> 00:41:51,932
where her 80-kilo pup can rest.

274
00:41:55,092 --> 00:41:56,412
The sea ice is retreating

275
00:41:56,492 --> 00:41:59,132
from much
of the walrus' traditional range,

276
00:41:59,332 --> 00:42:02,492
so they now have
to haul out on dry land.

277
00:42:07,812 --> 00:42:11,252
But a herd of hundreds
of quarrelsome mothers,

278
00:42:11,332 --> 00:42:15,372
some weighing almost a tonne,
is not an ideal nursery.

279
00:42:24,492 --> 00:42:28,332
Walruses on land stick together
for good reason.

280
00:42:30,532 --> 00:42:31,852
Polar bears.

281
00:42:36,332 --> 00:42:39,572
A full grown male walrus is gigantic,

282
00:42:39,652 --> 00:42:42,412
too big for even a
polar bear to tackle.

283
00:42:44,372 --> 00:42:47,772
So the bear is looking
for a walrus baby.

284
00:42:53,852 --> 00:42:57,132
The scent of the bear
spreads alarm through the colony.

285
00:43:04,532 --> 00:43:06,892
The walruses retreat into the sea.

286
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:28,412
The bear knows it won't be able
to catch them there.

287
00:43:38,252 --> 00:43:41,052
But she too has young ones to feed.

288
00:43:48,372 --> 00:43:51,252
What is a mother to do?

289
00:44:01,292 --> 00:44:04,132
A mother walrus still needs
to find a place

290
00:44:04,252 --> 00:44:05,852
where her young can rest.

291
00:44:13,532 --> 00:44:15,772
A melting iceberg might do,

292
00:44:17,092 --> 00:44:20,212
but she is not the first
to find this one.

293
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:30,612
Suitable places are already taken.

294
00:45:03,892 --> 00:45:06,532
Other mothers don't want to share.

295
00:45:11,332 --> 00:45:14,812
They, too, need a patch of ice
where they can protect their young.

296
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:25,732
A desperate mother has no choice
but to barge her way in.

297
00:45:48,972 --> 00:45:51,772
So this time everyone loses.

298
00:46:17,052 --> 00:46:20,052
Finding the right place
on these melting shores

299
00:46:20,292 --> 00:46:23,052
gets harder and harder.

300
00:46:57,652 --> 00:47:03,412
Solving these problems together
helps create a bond so strong

301
00:47:03,492 --> 00:47:08,172
that the mother will stay in contact
with her young for the rest of her life.

302
00:47:19,772 --> 00:47:23,372
But who knows now
what their future will be.

303
00:47:37,172 --> 00:47:40,492
As we understand more
about the complexity

304
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:42,972
of the lives of sea creatures,

305
00:47:44,292 --> 00:47:48,412
so we begin to appreciate
the fragility of their home.

306
00:47:50,212 --> 00:47:51,932
Our blue planet.

307
00:48:27,772 --> 00:48:31,332
Blue Planet II has been
four years in the making.

308
00:48:34,132 --> 00:48:36,692
The teams have explored every ocean,

309
00:48:36,812 --> 00:48:39,692
seeking extraordinary untold stories,

310
00:48:39,772 --> 00:48:41,452
many new to science.

311
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:52,332
Bringing a new understanding
of life beneath the waves.

312
00:49:02,972 --> 00:49:07,252
The latest diving technology
producing no bubbles or noise

313
00:49:07,372 --> 00:49:11,132
has allowed our teams
longer and closer encounters.

314
00:49:17,972 --> 00:49:21,332
To explore our final frontier,
the deep,

315
00:49:21,412 --> 00:49:24,812
we have spent a thousand hours
in submersibles

316
00:49:24,932 --> 00:49:27,612
over half a mile below the surface.

317
00:49:31,572 --> 00:49:33,972
Innovative new camera technology

318
00:49:34,052 --> 00:49:37,732
makes it possible to film moments
never seen before.

319
00:49:40,052 --> 00:49:45,492
Low-light cameras capture magical events
almost invisible to the naked eye.

320
00:49:56,572 --> 00:49:59,772
Probe cameras
give a completely fresh perspective

321
00:49:59,852 --> 00:50:02,332
into the lives of tiny creatures.

322
00:50:02,692 --> 00:50:04,612
Here he comes, here he comes.

323
00:50:04,732 --> 00:50:09,852
While suction cameras take us
on a giant's eye view of the ocean.

324
00:50:16,852 --> 00:50:21,092
But the sea is an unpredictable
and dangerous place to work.

325
00:50:25,812 --> 00:50:30,212
Nowhere more so than the so called
wild coast of South Africa.

326
00:50:33,492 --> 00:50:35,892
Home to surfing dolphins.

327
00:50:41,492 --> 00:50:45,852
The team's mission here
is to ride alongside the dolphins

328
00:50:45,932 --> 00:50:50,452
and record their surfing behaviour
in closer detail than ever before.

329
00:50:53,852 --> 00:50:56,012
These are treacherous seas,

330
00:50:56,132 --> 00:51:00,532
so the film crew enlists local
professional surfers to guide them.

331
00:51:09,252 --> 00:51:13,732
But this year, the waves are bigger
than anyone had anticipated.

332
00:51:15,532 --> 00:51:19,652
A daunting prospect for surf
cameraman, Chris Bryan.

333
00:51:21,172 --> 00:51:24,012
Yeah, I'm feeling pretty nervous,
the, uh...

334
00:51:24,212 --> 00:51:25,732
It's a big swell out there.

335
00:51:26,212 --> 00:51:29,532
Really big swell.
Like there's 20-foot waves out there,

336
00:51:29,612 --> 00:51:34,172
and, um, yeah this will probably be the
biggest seas I've ever been out in.

337
00:51:34,852 --> 00:51:37,132
No risks, no reward, I guess.

338
00:51:38,852 --> 00:51:40,692
Chris has a high-speed camera

339
00:51:40,772 --> 00:51:44,252
to shoot super slow motion action
in the waves.

340
00:51:49,132 --> 00:51:53,532
The challenge is to get as close to
the wave-riding dolphins as possible.

341
00:51:56,532 --> 00:52:00,492
The good news is that the dolphins
have been spotted on the horizon.

342
00:52:05,732 --> 00:52:09,452
Um, they said this was gonna be
the biggest swell of the year and...

343
00:52:09,932 --> 00:52:11,972
Hey, I've never seen
anything like this.

344
00:52:12,052 --> 00:52:14,852
This is much bigger
that I'd possibly imagined.

345
00:52:21,772 --> 00:52:23,092
In these waves,

346
00:52:23,172 --> 00:52:27,052
the only way to get out to the
dolphins is with a jet ski.

347
00:52:28,572 --> 00:52:30,372
It's gonna be enough
of a challenge for them

348
00:52:30,452 --> 00:52:31,932
to just kind of weave their way out.

349
00:52:56,572 --> 00:52:59,652
At last,
the driver's detailed knowledge

350
00:52:59,732 --> 00:53:02,172
gets them safely
through the massive breakers,

351
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:07,452
but the dolphins are
nowhere to be seen.

352
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:14,012
Leaving the crew to face
the hair-raising task

353
00:53:14,092 --> 00:53:15,612
of getting back to shore.

354
00:53:30,092 --> 00:53:31,892
Keep going, keep going!

355
00:53:41,972 --> 00:53:43,092
Whoa!

356
00:53:46,692 --> 00:53:48,212
MAN</fo

357
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:50,092
That was pretty wild, yeah.

358
00:53:50,292 --> 00:53:52,932
The wave actually hit
the back of the sled,

359
00:53:53,332 --> 00:53:55,748
and I was like, "Go, go. Get out
of here, guys. Get out of here."

360
00:53:55,772 --> 00:53:57,332
Heard a big bump and
almost bounced off

361
00:53:57,372 --> 00:54:00,452
trying to hold the camera
and, um, just rode out of there,

362
00:54:00,532 --> 00:54:01,972
but, yeah, it was hectic.

363
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:05,212
Just another day at the office.

364
00:54:10,332 --> 00:54:14,252
The next day brings
a sudden change in conditions.

365
00:54:18,532 --> 00:54:20,292
Plenty of dolphins...

366
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:22,652
but a calmer sea.

367
00:54:23,412 --> 00:54:26,372
We've got a complete lack
of any wave at all.

368
00:54:27,772 --> 00:54:29,772
Look out, look out, look out.

369
00:54:33,652 --> 00:54:35,532
As so often in the ocean,

370
00:54:35,612 --> 00:54:37,532
if you know you're
in the right place,

371
00:54:37,612 --> 00:54:40,972
you just need the patience
to wait for the perfect moment.

372
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:51,532
A week later and a storm
is once again brewing

373
00:54:51,612 --> 00:54:55,852
off the wild coast and
surf is building.

374
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:57,652
Feel like a nervous excitement.

375
00:54:57,732 --> 00:55:01,852
The conditions are absolutely perfect.
It's what we've been waiting for.

376
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:05,212
And the dolphins seem to know it.

377
00:55:07,052 --> 00:55:10,132
But Chris is struggling
to get a steady shot.

378
00:55:14,052 --> 00:55:15,332
Look at that.

379
00:55:16,452 --> 00:55:18,492
Hello, gentleman. Uh, this is tricky.

380
00:55:19,052 --> 00:55:22,452
Little tricky no the jet ski, uh,
just trying to get the right angle.

381
00:55:22,572 --> 00:55:23,948
So, I'm gonna have a go on the zodiac

382
00:55:23,972 --> 00:55:25,972
and hopefully have better luck
on that one.

383
00:55:37,932 --> 00:55:40,932
The inflatable boat
gives Chris a larger,

384
00:55:41,012 --> 00:55:43,252
more stable filming platform.

385
00:55:46,292 --> 00:55:51,092
At last, he's in exactly the right
place at exactly the right time.

386
00:55:56,372 --> 00:55:58,492
And the results are spectacular.

387
00:55:59,532 --> 00:56:01,652
That's amazing!

388
00:56:09,892 --> 00:56:11,372
Mission accomplished.

389
00:56:18,332 --> 00:56:21,292
And this intimate footage
is now available

390
00:56:21,372 --> 00:56:24,212
as part of wider scientific studies.

391
00:56:27,972 --> 00:56:30,692
Supporting evidence
that dolphins surf

392
00:56:30,812 --> 00:56:34,172
to strengthen friendships,
develop social skills

393
00:56:34,252 --> 00:56:37,932
and for the sheer exhilaration of it.

394
00:56:48,732 --> 00:56:49,812
Next time.

395
00:56:51,012 --> 00:56:52,372
The deep.

396
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:56,372
A world richer
than we ever though possible,

397
00:56:57,772 --> 00:56:59,212
where creatures thrive,

398
00:57:00,972 --> 00:57:04,412
in the most extreme
conditions on earth.

399
