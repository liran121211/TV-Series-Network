DAVID ATTENBOROUGH: <i>In a far corner</i>
<i>of South-East Asia,</i>

4
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,435
<i>lies the Coral Triangle.</i>

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,590
<i>A cluster of the richest coral reefs,</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

6
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,035
<i>Undersea cities crammed full of life.</i>

7
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,155
<i>As in any crowded metropolis,</i>

8
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,354
<i>there is fierce rivalry for space,</i>

9
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,995
<i>for food</i>

10
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,160
<i>and for a partner.</i>

11
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,553
<i>But the reef is also a place</i>
<i>full of opportunity.</i>

12
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,876
<i>A cuttlefish.</i>

13
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,480
<i>It specialises in hunting crabs.</i>

14
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,271
<i>But a large crab is a dangerous quarry.</i>

15
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,232
<i>It has powerful claws.</i>

16
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,637
<i>The cuttlefish, however,</i>
<i>has a remarkable talent.</i>

17
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,837
<i>Its skin contains millions</i>
<i>of pigment cells</i>

18
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,509
<i>with which it can create</i>
<i>ever-changing colours</i>

19
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,875
<i>and patterns.</i>

20
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,160
<i>And that apparently hypnotises the crab.</i>

21
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,033
<i>A cuttlefish may be clever,</i>

22
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,159
<i>but a shark is bigger.</i>

23
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,877
<i>And it eats cuttlefish.</i>

24
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,200
<i>Time to disappear.</i>

25
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,834
<i>Back to the hunt.</i>

26
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,834
<i>A new target,</i>
<i>but the same mesmerising technique.</i>

27
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,232
<i>For those that manage to establish</i>
<i>themselves in these bustling</i>

<i>undersea cities,</i>

29
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,520
<i>there can be great rewards.</i>

30
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,917
<i>Corals build themselves</i>
<i>homes of limestone,</i>

31
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,278
<i>in the warm, clear,</i>
<i>shallow seas of the Tropics.</i>

32
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,920
<i>Their reefs occupy less than one tenth</i>

33
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,999
<i>of one percent of the ocean floor.</i>

34
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,230
<i>Yet, they're home to a quarter</i>

35
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,710
<i>of all known marine species.</i>

36
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,760
<i>They are complex,</i>

37
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,470
<i>infinitely variant structures,</i>

38
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,916
<i>providing all kinds of homes</i>
<i>for their many residents,</i>

39
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,520

41
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,920
<i>Here, on Australia's Great Barrier Reef,</i>

42
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,270
<i>a coral grouper lives</i>
<i>by hunting for small fish.</i>

43
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,793
<i>But how do you get a meal here,</i>

44
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,720
<i>when you're too big</i>
<i>to squeeze into crevices?</i>

45
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,792
<i>And the grouper also has a rival,</i>

46
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,351
<i>one which is highly intelligent,</i>

47
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,277
<i>and seeks the same kind of prey.</i>

48
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,316
<i>An octopus.</i>

49
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,395
<i>It can reach into really narrow cracks.</i>

50
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,075
<i>Even so,</i>

51
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,233
<i>its prey often escapes.</i>

52
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,152
<i>What if they could work together?</i>

53
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,477
<i>The grouper turns pale,</i>

54
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,918
<i>and tries to attract</i>
<i>the octopus's attention.</i>

55
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,073
<i>It performs a head stand.</i>

56
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,998
<i>Not only is the grouper signalling</i>
<i>to the octopus,</i>

57
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,194
<i>it's indicating</i>
<i>where the prey is hiding.</i>

58
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,711
<i>The octopus reaches inside.</i>

59
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,954
<i>The fish take fright.</i>

60
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,754
<i>And swim straight into</i>
<i>the grouper's jaws.</i>

61
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,000
<i>Sometimes, the octopus gets the reward,</i>

62
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,075
<i>sometimes, the grouper does.</i>

63
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,711
<i>Two very different species</i>

64
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,596
<i>have discovered</i>
<i>that teamwork can bring success,</i>

<i>in reef city.</i>

66
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,756
<i>Teamwork, in fact,</i>
<i>is the very foundation of life</i>

67
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,036
<i>on the reef.</i>

68
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,840
<i>The corals themselves</i>
<i>also rely on a partnership.</i>

69
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,472
<i>But one of a much more intimate kind.</i>

70
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,511
<i>Corals are colonies</i>
<i>of anemone-like animals,</i>

71
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,996
<i>polyps.</i>

72
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,759
<i>Some as small as grains of sand.</i>

73
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,320
<i>Living inside the tissues of each polyp,</i>

74
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,636
<i>are minute plant-like cells,</i>
<i>invisible to the naked eye.</i>

75
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,039
<i>By day flourishing in tropical sunshine,</i>

76
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,960
<i>the plant-like cells provide the polyps</i>

77
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,879
<i>with up to 90% of their food.</i>

78
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,197
<i>And when it's dark,</i>
<i>the polyps continue to feed</i>

79
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,879
<i>by using their tentacles to grab</i>
<i>edible particles drifting by.</i>

80
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,470
<i>The polyps also extract</i>
<i>calcium carbonate from the sea water,</i>

81
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,509
<i>and use it to build a stony housing</i>
<i>for themselves.</i>

82
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,116
<i>Coral colonies</i>
<i>can continue to grow for centuries.</i>

83

<i>Possibly millennia.</i>

84
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,557

<i>that can reach the size of a house.</i>

<i>With their huge sloth</i>
<i>like mouths wide open</i>

173
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,437
<i>they filter out the plankton.</i>

174
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,157
<i>And the mantas create</i>
<i>a vortex of their own</i>

175
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,876
<i>that further concentrates their food.</i>

176
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,272
<i>This behaviour has been called</i>
<i>the manta cyclone.</i>

177
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,077
<i>Then the tide changes,</i>

178
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,912
<i>and the supply of food is cut of.</i>

179
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,075
<i>The mantas leave the lagoon.</i>

180
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,271
<i>Life on the sheltered side of the reef</i>
<i>is tranquil and peaceful.</i>

181
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,592
<i>In these suburbs,</i>
<i>any creature wishing to escape</i>

182
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,235
<i>from the bustling crowds of reef city,</i>

183
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,353
<i>can find plenty of space.</i>

184
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,196
<i>On the other hand,</i>

185
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,317
<i>there is nowhere to hide.</i>

186
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,475
<i>That, at night,</i>

187
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,917
<i>makes it a dangerous place.</i>

188
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,997
<i>Nocturnal predators,</i>
<i>such as this lion fish,</i>

189
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,597
<i>patrol the reef edge.</i>

190
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,598
<i>The hunter has become the hunted.</i>

191
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,915
<i>A bobbit,</i>

192
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,432
<i>a giant carnivorous worm</i>

193
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,231
<i>with jaws as sharp as daggers.</i>

194
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,117
<i>It has an ancestry that stretches back</i>
<i>more than four hundred million years.</i>

195
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,957
<i>It's a meter long.</i>

196
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,551
<i>It tastes for scent.</i>

197
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,475
<i>And feels for movement.</i>

198
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,991
<i>Dawn, and with light,</i>
<i>the reef becomes a safer place.</i>

199
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,870
<i>Little bream return to foraging.</i>

200
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,191
<i>The bobbit might still be hungry.</i>

201
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,550
<i>But now in daylight</i>
<i>the odds have shifted.</i>

202
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,951
<i>The bream can see the bobbit.</i>

203
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,553
<i>Instead of retreating,</i>

204
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,558
<i>they join together to blow away</i>
<i>the sand covering the worm.</i>

205
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,479
<i>So, taking away</i>
<i>its advantage of surprise.</i>

206
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,475
<i>By revealing the bobbit's hiding place,</i>

207
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,155
<i>they will all be able</i>
<i>to feed more safely.</i>

208
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,192
<i>But it pays to remember</i>

209
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,439
<i>there is a bobbit about.</i>

210
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,071
<i>Out here, on the sand flats,</i>

211
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,154
<i>there is safe accommodation for some.</i>

212
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,759
<i>The family of saddleback clownfish</i>
<i>have found an excellent home.</i>

213
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,030
<i>The tentacles</i>
<i>of this carpet anemone can kill.</i>

214
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,633
(CLICKING)

215
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,395
<i>But the clownfish</i>
<i>are immune to the poison,</i>

216
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,752
<i>so they can shelter from danger.</i>

217
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,112
<i>In return, the fish keep the anemone</i>
<i>clean of debris.</i>

218
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,553
<i>As with all clownfish,</i>

219
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,838
<i>the family is ruled by a big female.</i>

220
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,350
<i>Her white face marks her out</i>
<i>as the boss.</i>

221
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,234
<i>The diminutive male</i>
<i>has to prove his worth,</i>

222
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,917
<i>so he works tirelessly,</i>

223
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,030
<i>removing debris and generally keeping</i>
<i>on top of the housework.</i>

224
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,110
<i>His greatest challenge</i>
<i>is to find a safe place</i>

225
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,749
<i>where the boss can lay her eggs.</i>

226
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,471
<i>But there's nothing solid here</i>
<i>for the female to lay them on.</i>

227
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,831
<i>A nearby shell could be the solution.</i>

228
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,754
<i>If only he can move it</i>
<i>to the protection of the anemone.</i>

229
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,876
<i>Too heavy.</i>

230
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,589
<i>Besides, it has a mind of its own.</i>

231
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,870
<i>The hermit crab.</i>

232
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,196
<i>But out here, twice a day,</i>

233
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,079
<i>the anemone is swept by tidal currents,</i>

234
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,431
<i>and they bring in new opportunities.</i>

235
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,352
<i>An old plastic bottle.</i>

236
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,234
<i>Perhaps, this will do.</i>

237
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,520
<i>Not heavy enough.</i>

238
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,275
<i>A coconut shell.</i>

239
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,632
<i>It looks just right.</i>

240
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,836
<i>But it's a long way from home.</i>

241
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,160
<i>And he can't move it by himself.</i>

242
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,080
<i>So the pair now work together.</i>

243
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,473
<i>A little adjustment</i>
<i>to the anemone's tentacles,</i>

244
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,279
<i>in order to clear a space for it.</i>

245
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,511
<i>And the shell is tucked in.</i>

246
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,634
<i>The female lays.</i>

247
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,710
<i>A safe nursery at last.</i>

248
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,356
<i>He has proved himself worthy</i>
<i>to father her young.</i>

249
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,400
<i>And he fertilizes them.</i>

250
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,277
<i>Now he will meticulously tend the eggs,</i>

251
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,834
<i>keeping them clean</i>
<i>and healthy until they hatch</i>

252
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,554
<i>in 10 days time.</i>

253
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,834
<i>Reef creatures go to great lengths to</i>
<i>give their young a head start in life.</i>

254
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,513
<i>And nowhere more so</i>

255
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,037
<i>than on the remotest reefs in the world.</i>

256
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,119
<i>French Polynesia,</i>

257
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,319
<i>the very heart of the South Pacific.</i>

258
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,032
<i>Protected by their isolation,</i>

259
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,716
<i>some of the reefs here,</i>
<i>are still virtually pristine.</i>

260
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,635
<i>This marbled grouper has made it</i>
<i>in the city and reached adulthood.</i>

261
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,435
<i>Now, it's the time to mate.</i>

262
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,879
<i>To find a partner, he must head</i>
<i>to the most dangerous part of this reef:</i>

263
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,116
<i>The drop off.</i>

264
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,472
<i>Patrolled by grey reef sharks,</i>

265
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,795
<i>hundreds of them.</i>

266
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,280
<i>They seem to be resting,</i>

267
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,396
<i>for now.</i>

268
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,113
<i>Thousands of other groupers</i>
<i>have gathered on the seabed below.</i>

269
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,912
<i>The females are almost bursting</i>
<i>with eggs.</i>

270
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,120
<i>But to mate with one,</i>

271
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,036
<i>he must first get through the crowd</i>
<i>of other waiting males.</i>

272
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,631
<i>And they all have the same thing</i>
<i>on their minds.</i>

273
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,590
<i>They jostle to get as close as possible</i>
<i>to a female.</i>

274
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,159
<i>This male may have</i>
<i>secured pole position,</i>

275
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,557
<i>but the female won't release</i>
<i>her eggs for him to fertilize,</i>

276
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,516
<i>until conditions are just right.</i>

277
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,834
<i>Now the sharks begin to close in,</i>

278
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,276
<i>sensing that</i>
<i>the critical moment is approaching.</i>

279
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,600
<i>The tide is beginning to turn.</i>

280
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,120
<i>This could be the moment to spawn.</i>

281
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,755
<i>Suddenly, the females rush up</i>
<i>towards the surface</i>

282
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,475
<i>releasing their clouds</i>
<i>of eggs as they go.</i>

283
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,480
<i>The males pursue them,</i>
<i>simultaneously releasing their sperm.</i>

284
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,911
<i>It's an act</i>
<i>the groupers seem prepared to die for.</i>

285
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,278
<i>It's now or never.</i>

286
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,480
<i>The fertilized eggs,</i>

287
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,354
<i>will now be swept away</i>

288
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,915
<i>from the many hungry mouths</i>
<i>of the reef dwellers.</i>

289
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,917
<i>Most of the billions of eggs</i>
<i>that cloud the sea,</i>

290
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,435
<i>will be eaten.</i>

291
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,715
<i>But a few,</i>

292
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,991
<i>a tiny but crucial minority,</i>

293
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,632
<i>will find another reef</i>

294
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,873
<i>and make it their home.</i>

295
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,720
<i>But today's coral reefs</i>
<i>are facing a new threat.</i>

296
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,791
<i>The seas are warming.</i>

297
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,234
<i>A rise in temperature</i>
<i>of just one for two degrees</i>

298
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,200
<i>for just a few weeks,</i>

299
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:42,472
<i>can be enough to cause the coral polyps</i>
<i>to eject their plant-like cells.</i>

300
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,280
<i>When that happens,</i>
<i>the corals lose both their colour,</i>

301
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,076
<i>and their main source of food.</i>

302
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,909
<i>If the high temperatures are sustained,</i>

303
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,030
<i>coral, bleached in this way,</i>

304
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,033
<i>is likely to die.</i>

305
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,753
<i>In recent years, it's thought that</i>
<i>half the world's coral reefs,</i>

306
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,872
<i>have been effected by bleaching,</i>

307
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,914
<i>including since 2016.</i>

308
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,437
<i>around two thirds</i>
<i>of the shallow water corals,</i>

309
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,035
<i>on Australia's Great Barrier Reef.</i>

310
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,832
<i>These once crowded submarine cities,</i>

311
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,950
<i>are reduced</i>

312
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,000
<i>to bleak ruins.</i>

313
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,757
<i>And many of their inhabitants,</i>
<i>left homeless.</i>

314
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,554
<i>Some scientists predict</i>
<i>that by the end of the century,</i>

315
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,037
<i>coral reef cities as we know them,</i>

316
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,077
<i>could be a thing of the past.</i>

317
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:54,430
<i>Is there any future for these most</i>
<i>precious of ocean treasures?</i>

318
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,552
<i>Well, that ultimately depends</i>
<i>on how fast they heat up,</i>

319
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,071
<i>and how warm the seas become.</i>

320
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,913
<i>And there is a glimmer of hope,</i>

321
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,109
<i>because of the way</i>
<i>the corals reproduce themselves.</i>

322
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,031
<i>On one special night of the year,</i>

323
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,680
<i>the full moon triggers</i>
<i>an extraordinary event:</i>

324
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,240
<i>The spawning of the coral.</i>

325
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:08,072
<i>With extraordinary synchrony,</i>
<i>entire reefs reproduce.</i>

326
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,193
<i>Billions of fertilized eggs drift away</i>

327
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,471
<i>carried by the ocean currents.</i>

328
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,237
<i>And it's not just the corals that spawn,</i>

329
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,358
<i>so do many other residents of the reef.</i>

330
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,957
<i>A whole range of young</i>

331
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,197
<i>are swept through the oceans,</i>

332
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,634
<i>ready to settle on a vacant site,</i>

333
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,556
<i>and bring back into existence</i>
<i>the complex community,</i>

334
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,037
<i>that is a coral reef.</i>

335
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,714
<i>We may not know what the future</i>
<i>hold for our seas,</i>

336
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,554
<i>but coral reefs can regenerate.</i>

337
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,875
<i>As long as some reefs survive,</i>

338
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,160
<i>some hope can remain.</i>

339
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,320
<i>French Polynesia.</i>

340
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,075
<i>Over 4,000 miles from the nearest</i>
