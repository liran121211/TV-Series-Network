While there, he meets a girl named Kurisu Makise who explicitly states that he had met her 15 minutes ago, despite having never seen her before. Later on, Okabe hears a scream and sees Kurisu lying in a pool of blood. As he sends a text about it to another one of his research buddies, Itaru \"Daru\" Hashida, Okabe has a strange experience, finding the street he is on has suddenly become deserted and a strange satellite has crashed into the building he was just in. Later on, while fiddling with their strange remote-controlled microwave oven, which turns bananas into a gel-like substance, Daru tells Okabe that the seminar he supposedly attended was cancelled, much to his surprise. Okabe later discovers that the text he sent to Daru had been sent a week ago, just before encountering Kurisu, who is alive and well.\u2014Wikipedia"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2054520", "rating": 7.4, "votes": 2195, "number_of_episodes": 26}
