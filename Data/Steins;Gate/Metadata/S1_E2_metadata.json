After getting some provisions from cross-dresser Ruka Urushibara, Okabe meets Suzuha Amane, who is hired by his landlord, Yuugo 'Mr. Braun' Tennouji, as a part time assistant in his electronics shop below Okabe's apartment. Later, Okabe investigates the supposedly altered events and learns that a man calling himself John Titor, who claimed in 2000 that he was a time traveler, has surfaced once more in 2010. However, all evidence of Titor's 2000 visit have vanished and, with the exception of Okabe, no one remembers it. The next day, Okabe encounters a strange woman named Moeka Kiryuu who asks for information on a retro PC model called IBN-5100, which Okabe gathers from Itaru. Later, Okabe and Itaru conduct an experiment where a banana placed in their microwave vanishes, only to end up reattached to the bunch it came from in a gelled state.
