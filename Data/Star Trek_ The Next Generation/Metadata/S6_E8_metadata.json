Geordi and Data get permission to do an experiment, taking the main computer off line a few hours and Data's circuit running various systems, but a small physical burn-out in Data causes a series of malfunctions in him, such as his vocabulary and voice aberrations, but also various glitches in the many functions of the ship's computer, such as keeping track of recordings of say Picard's flute music or the text of a play Crusher and Riker are in. It's worst of all for Worf, who was ordered by Picard to indulge in some purposeless leisure, and chose to join his son Alexander on the holodeck as sheriff and deputy, with period adept Troi as mysterious stranger, in Deadwood, a Wild West evocation, in which two Data-like villains appear, also father and son, with daunting android abilities and no regular computer-restraint..\u2014KGF Vissers", "While waiting to rendezvous with another ship, the crew of the Enterprise have some free time to pursue their pastimes. Worf and son Alexander spend time on the holodeck where Alexander has written a program that takes them to the old west. Even Counselor Troi joins them. Meanwhile, Geordi and Data experiment with the ship's computer to determine if Data could act act as a backup if needed. After a power surge all of the ship's systems seem to have been corrupted - including the holodeck where Data now takes the role of all the holographic bad guys including the local gunslinger. It all proves to be a potentially deadly situation when the players realize the holodeck's safeguards have been turned off.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708669", "rating": 7.4, "votes": 3474, "number_of_episodes": 176}
