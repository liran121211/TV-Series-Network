Unknown to anyone however is that she has telekinetic powers and the ability to create just by thinking about it. When the warp core's containment field fails, Amanda is able to contain it and return the reaction chamber to normal. Much to Captain Picard's and the rest of the crew's dismay, Q suddenly appears. It was Q who set off the engine fault to test her powers and confirm what he thought - that she is a Q. He's quite adamant that Amanda be trained in how to use her powers after which she would join the continuum. She refuses to go with him but as he teaches her to use her powers, she decides to use them to spend some time with Commander Riker with whom she has become enamored. Picard obtains important information about the deaths of her parents but Q offers her a choice: to join the continuum or to live among humans and never use her powers.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708834", "rating": 7.4, "votes": 3415, "number_of_episodes": 176}
