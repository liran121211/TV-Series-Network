The Federation has concluded a peace treaty with the Cardassians, which reassigns several planets, including one where a tribe of Native Americans relocated twenty years ago. Picard grudgingly accepts the assignment to relocate the colonists, who refuse to be uprooted a second time in two centuries. Their chief even claims that Picard is there to acquit his ancestor's part in a slaughter of his tribe 23 generations ago. The Cardassians arrive six weeks early for a 'legal' survey of the colony, stirring resistance. This is fueled by Wesley, who accepted an invitation from a Native American, who claims to have seen him during his vision quest, to undertake his own. It leads to Wesley's late dad, telling him that it's time to take a different path from his. Picard tries to get through to Cardassian commander Gul Evek. Wesley makes a major discovery and choice.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708738", "rating": 6.2, "votes": 3098, "number_of_episodes": 176}
