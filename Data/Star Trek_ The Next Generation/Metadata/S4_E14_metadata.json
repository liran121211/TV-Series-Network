It creates a small, unstable local wormhole, causing everybody to be unconscious, presumably for just half a minute according to the instruments. However strange changes are observed, such as spores showing a full day's growth and the ship is even off course, near a planet of another class. Doubts are inevitable, even about Data, as Geordi finds only they two were able to circumvent the computer security program preventing the clock manipulation which is the only logical explanation, and Data is in perfect working order. Geordi proves that the planet image before the black-out is a fake altered from memory banks, only Data could have switched them and staged an apparent wormhole; Data claims to be unable to verify and should be court-martialed, probably the end of his Starfleet career, but why would he accept such risk? A settled fracture in Worf's hand proves someone must have been awake. Picard concludes Data must have had a compelling reason to lie and disobey his orders, presumably answering someone else's, and indeed, when the ship returns to the site of the incident, in the system of the Paxans ...\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise goes through a small wormhole with everyone on board other than Data being knocked unconscious for about 30 seconds. Soon after, the crew begins to see anomalies starting with Dr. Crusher who was growing a spore in the lab. After the blackout, she finds that the spores have undergone 24 hours of growth. Picard begins to suspect that Data may not be telling them the truth about how long they were unconscious. Geordi confirms that they were out for much longer that Data claims and others on the ship begin finding odd bits of information. Counselor Troi has a scary hallucination while Lt. Worf learns that he had recently broken his wrist. It becomes apparent to Picard that Data is acting under orders. He's not quite prepared however when Data reveals the identity of the person who have those orders: Captain Jean-Luc Picard.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708688", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 4154, "number_of_episodes": 176}
