Captain Jean-Luc Picard decides to speed up his official diplomatic approach (a.k.a. First Contact protocols) and intercede on Riker's behalf, but they are told by a fascinated, open-minded Malcorian scientist that her planet's culture is particularly xenophobic and would reject any alien as being unequal to them. The Malcorian government keeps the matter secret but is internally divided: while Chancellor Durken is in favor of Riker's release without his people finding out and establishing friendly relations with the Federation, his powerful security minister, Krola, is prepared to go to any length to preserve their traditional way of life, including framing Riker for murder.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Captain Picard and crew are about to engage in one of their more dangerous exercises - making first contact with the Malcorians, a race on the cusp of developing warp power. Experience tells the Federation it is better to make first contact before they set off into space. An advance team has already been on the planet for some time, Commander Riker among them, posing as Malcorians to make final arrangements. Unbeknown to Picard, Riker is in a hospital, having been severely injured in a riot. Picard and Counselor Troi make contact with native scientist Mirasta Yale (responsible for the warp program), who is enthusiastic at what they propose. Not all Malcorians welcome contact, however, and the planet's leader, Chancellor Durken, must decide to what extent his people are prepared to learn definitively that they are not alone in the universe.\u2014garykmcd", "Commander William Riker is injured while visiting a planet on a First Contact mission. Hospitalized, the planet's inhabitants discover he is not one of them. Riker's predicament forces the Enterprise crew to speed up the First Contact timetable in order to save him, even though some on the planet believe the Enterprise is on a mission of conquest instead of peace.\u2014Moviedude1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708715", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 4019, "number_of_episodes": 176}
