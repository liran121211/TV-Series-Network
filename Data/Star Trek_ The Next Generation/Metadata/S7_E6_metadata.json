Dr. Soong's dream program gives Data his first nightmares; Troi advises against stopping it. She suggests therapy and a temporary interruption when the visions disturb his internal chronometer so he oversleeps, and spontaneously occur while on duty. However one element proves a real organism, so it's decided that Geordi and Picard use a device that allows them to enter Data's dreams and interact with him and other characters.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708755", "rating": 7.5, "votes": 3189, "number_of_episodes": 176}
