A visit from Picard makes them realize the key must be Romulan senator Pardek, with whom Spock maintains decades-long personal contacts, against Sarek's will. Meanwhile, Klingon leader Gowron is writing the Federation's help in the civil war out of official history, so Picard resorts to suggestions to get him to provide a cloaked ship, reluctantly commanded by Captain K'Vada, for this mission, with Data, both prepared to impersonate Romulans on Romulus. Meanwhile, Commander Riker and Counselor Troi find examining the disappearance of a Vulcan ship to and from the Ferengi most dangerous.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise is urgently recalled to a nearby Starbase where Captain Picard is informed that Ambassador Spock has disappeared and been reported on Romulus. They are certain he has not been kidnapped and at this stage believe he has defected. Picard visits Spock's dying father, Ambassador Sarek, who has not seen his son for some time and has little information for him. Picard enlists the assistance of the Klingons - who are rather less friendly now that their civil war is over - to get a ship with a cloaking device. Made to look like Romulans, Picard and Data are soon on Romulus meeting with Senator Pardek and others hoping to learn exactly what Spock is doing. Meanwhile, Commander Riker and the Enterprise investigate why the Ferengi might be interested in old Vulcan ships from a space-based junkyard.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708835", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 3830, "number_of_episodes": 176}
