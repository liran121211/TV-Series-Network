The Enterprise approaches a temporal distortion from which another Federation vessel is emerging. The evasive action action they take - using the tractor beam to push the oncoming vessel away from them - is unsuccessful and the Enterprise is destroyed, at which point the time loop brings them back to the beginning and they relive the sequence all over again. Several members of the crew however begin to have a serious case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and become convinced that they are reliving the same day, over and over. Data has an idea that might get them out of it.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0162905", "rating": 8.9, "votes": 5124, "number_of_episodes": 176}
