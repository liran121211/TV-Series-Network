When the Admiral takes a de-aging drug, he endangers both his life and the mission.", "The Enterprise travels to the planet Persephone 5 to collect Admiral Mark Jamieson and transport him to Mordan IV to again lead a hostage negotiation on the planet where he had achieved a successful negotiation 40 years before. The Admiral makes it quite clear that he is in command the mission, but not the ship. En route, Jamieson, who is quite elderly and suffering from the incurable Iverson's disease, takes an alien rejuvenation drug that makes him younger. It soon becomes apparent that the hostages are being held by the planet's ruler, Karnas, not a terrorist group as he had claimed. When it also come to light that Jamieson's success was not brought about in the manner recorded in Federation history books, it becomes clear that it is the Admiral himself Karnas is after.\u2014garykmcd", "The Enterprise is ordered to bring wheelchair-bound retired admiral Mark Jameson, with his wife, to a planet which recently ended decades of civil war, where government chief Karnas asked specifically for the reputed negotiator now several hostages' lives are at stake. Picard must also accept that Starfleet made the admiral senior mission officer, hence in sole charge of the away team, which Picard decides to join. Meanwhile it becomes clear that the mystery therapy Jameson started for his incurable disease is working wonders, but may come at an equally extreme price as his rejuvenation gets out of control.
