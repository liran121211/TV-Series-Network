In Picard's failed attempt to stop the apocalyptic phenomenon and save the primitive culture, he broke the Federation's prime directive of non-intervention in natural development. Worf is furious to discover that Nikolai has secretly transported a village to their simulation of caves inside the holodeck, but Picard grudgingly accepts his plan to transport them to a comparable M-class planet as their new home. However, Geordi has a hard time keeping the holodeck running because of plasmodic interference-caused damage, so Worf joins Nikolai as a seer with supernatural powers, and discovers Nikolai has another connection with a Boraalan.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise responds to a distress signal sent by Worf's adopted brother Dr. Nikolai Rozhenko who has been studying local villagers on a distant planet. The planet's atmosphere has been fast disappearing and Nikolai breaks the Prime Directive by making himself known and doing his best to save them. Picard isn't at all happy with the situation but without telling anyone, Nikolai beams the villagers aboard the Enterprise directly into the holodeck where he has recreated their village. He proposes to find a habitable planet for them and then to beam them down to the surface without them ever knowing they have actually left their homeworld. Picard doesn't have much choice but to agree. This all gets very complicated when one of the villagers manages to leave the holodeck and roam around the ship.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708731", "rating": 7.0, "votes": 3000, "number_of_episodes": 176}
