This time he focuses on Commander Riker and sets out to prove that mankind will not do the right thing when the opportunity presents itself. To prove his point, he vests in Riker all of his powers convinced that the old adage about absolute power corrupting absolutely will prove to be true. Riker is obviously tempted to play God but his assumptions about giving people the opportunity to be whatever they want doesn't go over quite well. Picard knew that the experiment would fail and wins his wager with Q.\u2014garykmcd", "The Enterprise's urgent rescue mission to a planet colony in distress after an explosion is interrupted by Q. He feels nothing takes priority over his plan, a 'game' in which humanity, notably Riker, can win an unsurpassed prize or perish with his Q-selected away party. It's a Napoleonic battle against uniformed monsters. The captain is left in his disabled ship, which also serves as penalty bench. Riker survives, but only by accepting the prize, which proves no lesser challenge: wielding Q-powers over the entire crew, while Picard advocates against any 'profitable' use.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708728", "rating": 6.9, "votes": 4339, "number_of_episodes": 176}
