They were on a training mission and one of them, Jono, turns out to be human. A medical scan reveals several healed injuries leading Dr. Crusher to believe Jono may have been abused. Data identifies the boy as Jeremiah Rossa, grandson of Federation Admiral Connaught Rossa. His parents were killed when the Talarians attacked their colony and the boy was apparently taken prisoner. Although a human, the boy has been fully assimilated into the warlike and highly patriarchal Talarian culture. When the Talarian Captain Endar, who claims Jono as is son, demands the boy's return, Picard refuses.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708779", "rating": 6.4, "votes": 3540, "number_of_episodes": 176}
