The user fully controls the end experience via a probe in his exact (save for eyes) image at a distance. While it's used in the inhospitable atmosphere of a planet where the spaceship Romane crashed, Starfleet reports that Geordi's mother captain Silva La Forge's ship, Hera, is missing. Geordi's probe meets someone there that is exactly like, and claiming to be, his mother, who insists on help for her crew. Despite trouble with the interface physically endangering his life at unsafe levels causing the tests to be suspended, Data helps him return to 'Silva' and find out the deceptive truth.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708737", "rating": 6.2, "votes": 2851, "number_of_episodes": 176}
