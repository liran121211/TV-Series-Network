P. Hanson personally boarded the Enterprise to join the investigation of a destroyed Federation-colonized planet, suspecting the feared Borg. Before this is confirmed, he points out Commander William T. Riker has for the third time refused a command, preferring the Enterprise. Shortly after an enormous Borg ship is found, it engages in battle with the Enterprise, which draws it away. Novel tactics are conceived. Captain Jean-Luc Picard is ordered to come aboard for unprecedented discussions, and kidnapped when he refuses. He finds they tolerate no resistance, and intend to turn him into a Borg. Riker suddenly finds himself acting captain....\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise finds that an entire Federation colony has been destroyed and Admiral Hanson advises Captain Picard that it appears to be the work of the Borg. The Admiral assigns Lt. Comander Shelby, their expert on the Borg, to the Enterprise. They quickly track down the large cube-like Borg spacecraft but find they have few weapons they can use against it. Shelby is certainly knowledgeable about the Borg but is also a risk-taker who challenges Commander Riker at every turn. She makes it quite clear that she's after his job. When Captain Picard is kidnapped, she leads an away team onto the Borg ship to rescue him. What they find is that Picard has himself been transformed into a Borg.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708785", "rating": 9.3, "votes": 6188, "number_of_episodes": 176}
