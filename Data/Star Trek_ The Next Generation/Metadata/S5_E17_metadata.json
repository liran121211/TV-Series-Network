When a probe follows an inexplicable neutrino emission, it too suddenly vanishes without a trace, possibly the first-ever documented 'null-space', which absorbs all electromagnetic forces around it. Riker will attempt to chart it in a shuttle with the J'naii Soren. While contemplating the differences between social and biological life with or without gender-distinctions they become close. Entering the null-space, they find the shuttle and beam back with its crew of two to the J'naii's green planet, where they fall in love. Soren is arrested for loving sexually and sentenced to psychotectic therapy.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise assists the J'naii, an androgynous race that has no gender, in locating one of their missing shuttle craft. Commander Riker works with the J'naii pilot Soren to recover the spaceship. They have some difficulty understanding each other with Riker always using gender specific pronouns, but they're friendly. Eventually, Soren reveals her deepest, darkest secret: she does feel like a female but simply cannot reveal that to anyone on her planet where their genderless society is paramount. As Riker and Soren become closer, her secret is revealed.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708815", "rating": 6.8, "votes": 3654, "number_of_episodes": 176}
