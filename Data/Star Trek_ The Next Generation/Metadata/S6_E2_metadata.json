Barclay joins an away team, only to find something in the beam with him.", "The Enterprise locates the scientific research ship USS Yosemite, which went missing while exploring plasma streams. Geordi assigns reluctant engineer Lieutenant Reg Barclay, whose idea it was, to help him bridge both ships' transport systems and join Riker's away team, but after a deconstruction phobia-caused hesitation and anxiety counseling with Troi, Barclay goes later, alone. Riker's team finds victims of an explosion, which may fit the Ferengi report Picard receives of an alleged Cardassian attack. While Barclay beams back, he notices an eel-shaped entity which floats to him and touches his left arm in the phased matter stream, but a full transporter diagnostic finds no problem, so he fears he is a victim of incurable transporter psychosis, although none has been reported on modern models for years. Geordi realizes either would fit with the same ionic fluctuation phenomenon suggested by in otherwise acceptable transporter readings. Worried about Barclay's mental condition, Troi orders him to take a leave, during which he apparently experiences some physical transformation of his possibly infected arm, so he decides to do another transporter test during which the 'eel' reappears. Picard now authorizes an attempt to contain it, starting a cascade of surprising consequences.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708761", "rating": 7.3, "votes": 3230, "number_of_episodes": 176}
