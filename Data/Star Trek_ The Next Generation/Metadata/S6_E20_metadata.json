Upon being refused again in favor of fleet duty, Galen goes alone, but his shuttle is captured by Yridians, who sell his vital findings, which Data, La Forge and Crusher help decipher, revealing an incredible DNA sequence, common to at least nineteen independent sentient life forms. As it turns out, it was sold to the Klingons and Cardassians too, who arrive simultaneously at the planet, from where they suspect the common source, which included a hidden 'program', originated. Yet this setting holds further surprises from still other races.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708789", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 3704, "number_of_episodes": 176}
