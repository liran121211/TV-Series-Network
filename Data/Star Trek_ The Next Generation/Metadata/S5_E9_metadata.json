En route to it, an unknown vessel appears after a temporal distortion and beams aboard history professor Berlingoff Rasmussen from Earth three centuries later (the 26th), who is obsessed by Picard, who expects the whole crew to be questioned, despite the possibilities of fraud or altering reality. Once at Penthara IV, Geordi on the planet and Data aboard devise a method to create a greenhouse-effect, at the risk of making it far worse, so Picard wrestles with using Rasmussen's hindsight, but his own history proves significantly problematic.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise is dispatched to Penthara IV where the inhabitants face a never-ending \"winter\" after an asteroid strikes the planets. On the way, the sensors detect a powerful temporal distortion and soon after, Berlinghoff Rasmussen appears on the bridge. He claims to be a historian from the 26th century who has traveled back in time to experience history. He's quite convincing and while he is definitely a time traveler his story isn't quite accurate. As for the planet, the Enterprise's first attempt to save goes horribly wrong leading to a series of strong earthquakes. They have only one chance left after that to rectify the problem.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708672", "rating": 7.2, "votes": 3396, "number_of_episodes": 176}
