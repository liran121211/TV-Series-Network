Data intercepts a Romulan ship signal announcing it will pass the neutral zone in six hours; Picard forbids that but must promise to deliver the wounded, after recovering Geordi. Despite the Romulan's assurance, Geordi is surprised by an armed other Romulan survivor and is blinded by the radiation; they should collaborate to survive. Klingon Lt. Worf proves the only possible donor to save the captive, but objects to helping the species which killed his parents. The Romulan rescue ship's commander Tomalak being found a liar and most impatient, Picard fears a casus belli.\u2014KGF Vissers", "While scouting a storm-ravaged planet near the Neutral Zone, an away team from the Enterprise encounters a crashed Romulan shuttle. A wounded survivor is beamed back to the ship, while Geordi is trapped on the planet with the shuttle's other occupant.\u2014crouchbk", "An Enterprise away team finds itself on a planet with a hostile environment. The time they can spend there is limited but they come across a crashed Romulan vessel with a survivor in need of medical attention. When the time comes to beam aboard the Enterprise, they are unable to locate Geordi La Forge who has suffered a fall. He's uninjured but is soon taken prisoner by a second Romulan officer. With the climatic conditions on the planet, Geordi is soon blind as well when his visor fails. On board the Enterprise, Dr. Crusher tries to save the injured Romulan but the only possible genetic donor is Lt. Worf, whose parents were killed by Romulans, and he flatly refuses to do so. It all gets very complicated for Captain Picard when they discover that a Romulan vessel is about to breach the Neutral Zone to rescue their men.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708795", "rating": 7.8, "votes": 3876, "number_of_episodes": 176}
