And Riker is ordered to secrecy.", "Picard quickly escapes starring as role model in the school's annual \"Captain Picard Day\" responding to a top-secret assignment from Admiral Eric Pressman, once Will Riker's captain aboard the starship Pegasus. The Pegasus was lost 12 years ago and presumed destroyed, but in fact still in existence. The mission is to get to the ship before the Romulans (who have a three day head start) and prevent Enterprise-type technology falling into enemy hands. Only Will is told by Pressman of their real mission: to retrieve the computer code and repeat the secret experiment that started the fatal cloaking accident. Picard discovers there was a mutiny on the Pegasus, covered up by intelligence. The Enterprise finds the Pegasus in an asteroid fissure and hides from an approaching Romulan warbird so they can return alone later - but finds it partially materialized inside the rock. When Pressman and Riker find the experiment inside, Will must make up his mind, but they're not alone.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708817", "rating": 8.4, "votes": 3685, "number_of_episodes": 176}
