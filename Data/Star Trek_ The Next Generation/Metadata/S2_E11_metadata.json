Before the Enterprise can assist, the Yamato explodes with all lives lost. The explosion appears as the result of a failure in their matter/anti-matter pods, but Picard suspects it may have something to do with a relic the Yamato's captain obtained at an archaeological dig on a nearby planet. As they are in the Neutral Zone, they are shadowed by a Romulan warbird. With both ships now suffering technical glitches, Picard, an amateur archaeologist, leads an away team to a distant planet to investigate the remnants of that ancient race and rectify their problem - a one-way trip if the glitchy Enterprise can't beam them back.\u2014garykmcd", "Responding to his friend captain Donald Varley's emergency call from the Neutral Zone, Picard can only listen to him explain having fallen prey to mysterious system glitches during archaeological research on a planet he believes to be the home of the heretofore mythical Iconian race, whose advanced technology could give the Federation or Romulans preponderance. Suddenly, the Yamamoto explodes, and a Romulan warbird decloaks, ordering the Enterprise to leave instantly. Picard resolves to continue Varley's research, leading an away team to an unknown planet while the Enterprise displays a similar, rapidly-spreading sequence of system glitches (as does the Romulan ship). As Geordi, his engineers and the away team race to explain and cure their dilemma (presumably involving the alien planet's huge probe satellites), Data gets impaired in a subterranean Iconian control room.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise is called to help a sister ship - in the Neutral Zone - that is having major system problems. They are able to download the ship's logs from a distance. Unfortunately, the ship is destroyed shortly after they arrive, then problems start to happen with the Enterprise's computer systems, and then the Romulans show up.\u2014Anonymous"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708692", "rating": 7.6, "votes": 3849, "number_of_episodes": 176}
