He is puzzled by their lack of desire to escape, but they explain that it's not a prison: they have chosen to remain since returning would be a great dishonor to their families, who have assumed the warriors died in battle. Instead, Worf begins to teach the younger Klingons about their ancestry and the proud tradition that exists among them, much to the chagrin of the elders.\u2014Moviedude1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708680", "rating": 7.3, "votes": 3168, "number_of_episodes": 176}
