Retired female Federation Admiral Satie and her former assistants arrive to take charge of the investigation, with security chief Worf. Meanwhile Data and LaForge look into the sabotage risk.

After a paranormal counsel believes Tarses a liar, he's tricked by lies into acting guilty, even though the 'sabotage' was in fact found to be an accidental failure, and confesses he lied about his ancestry to hide a Romulan grandfather. Picard objects against the unethical procedure, Satie calls upon Starfleet chief of security Admiral Henry to look for an even wider conspiracy, starting with Picard himself, based on his long-term record, and Worf, based on his father's treason...\u2014KGF Vissers", "After J'Ddan, a Klingon serving temporarily on the Enterprise, is believed to have passed on Federation secrets to the Romulans retired Admiral Nora Satie is brought out of retirement to assist with the investigation.
