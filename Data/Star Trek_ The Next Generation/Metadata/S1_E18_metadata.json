Only one of the four will be accepted into the Academy and the competition will be strong. Wesley is particularly worried about the psychological evaluation which will focus on what he fears most. He has no idea what that is, however. Picard's old friend, Admiral Gregory Quinn requests to be beamed aboard and arrives with Commander Remick from the Inspector General's office. Remmick is there to conduct a complete investigation of the ship's operations. His very presence is unnerving to both the Captain and the bridge crew and his questions to the senior officers all seem to indicate that it is Captain Picard who is under investigation with his decisions, judgment and reliability all in question.\u2014garykmcd", "Wesley is stressed about the annual competition between four ace students for a place in Starfleet Academy. He proves his academic superiority even to a Vulcan, but due to his own generous assistance to runner-op alien Mordock, all still hangs on the 'psych test' he so feared. Meanwhile the Enterprise, staying around, gets a surprise visit from Picard's friend admiral Gregory Quinn, who refuses to state the purpose of a full, apparently hostile audit of the starship by Lt. Cmdr. Dexter Remmick from the inspector-general's office. Afterward, Picard must make a career-crucial choice.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708690", "rating": 7.1, "votes": 3981, "number_of_episodes": 176}
