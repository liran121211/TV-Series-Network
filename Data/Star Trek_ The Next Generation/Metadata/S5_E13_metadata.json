He does allow a small Enterprise party to visit their society, which, after eight generations of selective breeding to nearly eliminate the remaining human risk factors, they believe far superior. Despite their rigid rule never to leave, scientist Hannah Bates is allowed to come aboard to work out a method to deflect the approaching fragment jointly with Geordi, who, as a blind man, would not even have been born in their society, by a tractor beam and updates to the biosphere itself. While Picard disapproves of genetic 'predisposition' on principle, Troi becomes a platonic intimate with Conor, who would be prepared to accept her even as a genetically inferior mate. The deflection works at the last second before energy would have been fatally over-expended: the colony is safe from impact, but Hannah reports fatal tectonic damage, which Geordi soon finds to be faked in order to get out of her controlled life. She and others want asylum aboard, but the colony's delicate balance can't cope with such change. Conor, although in fact tempted himself, feels guilty and desperately tries to save his society.\u2014KGF Vissers", "While on a scientific expedition, the Enterprise comes across a human colony living in a domed city on a planet that will be severely damaged by the phenomena the crew are studying. The society is unique in that they have used selective genetics to eliminate all flawed people among them. They are all healthy and highly intelligent but somewhat leery of strangers. The arrival of the Enterprise with its assortment of species and human \"defects\" (such as sightless Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge) results in some of the people questioning just how special they really are.\u2014garykmcd", "Studying the path of a massive stellar fragment, the Enterprise discovers an unknown, perfectly balanced human colony on Moab IV, the proud result of two centuries of selective breeding to weed out physical defects and achieve perfect social balance. Only with doom approaching does leader Aaron Conor permit visitors into the sealed-off colony's biosphere, a leader by selective design who, nonetheless, believes his colony can weather the catastrophic seismic effects to come. Convinced of the approaching disaster (and enjoying a platonic romance with Counselor Troi while considering evacuation), he permits city scientist Hannah Bates to work with Geordi La Forge to derive a solution aboard the Enterprise. Together they do indeed devise and implement a solution, but the very act of interaction violates the Prime Directive and disrupts the balance of this carefully crafted society, threatening its destruction just as much as the passing stellar fragment.\u2014statmanjeff"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708806", "rating": 6.7, "votes": 3164, "number_of_episodes": 176}
