From then on the aliens take over, 'possessing' Data's positronic network to give him several of their personalities, including the talkative Ehad and the feared queen Musaka. Alas they also transform matter and even genetics aboard, so as to turn the ship into a city their style. Picard resolves to stop that by understanding and playing the key alien characters.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708748", "rating": 5.8, "votes": 3276, "number_of_episodes": 176}
