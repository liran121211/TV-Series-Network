Traveling past a mysterious energy cloud, something curious boards the ship, jumping between machinery and crew members, as if seeking a suitable host and learning about the ship without revealing itself. The crew catches on slowly, as nobody seems seriously affected by the highly intelligent host entity (except Wesley's engineering mentor Singh, killed in a warp technology energy surge).\u2014KGF Vissers", "As the Enterprise provides transportation to two delegate parties constantly at odds with each other, the ship is invaded by something that jumps from computer terminal to crew members and back again, unbeknownst to the crew (even the ones being invaded).\u2014Moviedude1", "The Enterprise's task: transport two warring parties to the planet Parliament for treaty negotiations. En route, however, they come across an energy cloud and, unbeknownst to the crew, an energy life force that inhabits both machinery and humanoids alike has boarded.
