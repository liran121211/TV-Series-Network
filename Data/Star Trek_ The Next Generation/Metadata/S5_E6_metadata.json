Everyone is happy to see the popular, brilliant boy back and hear about his faring, some exchanging some of their own cadet memories. New Ensign Lefler, about his age, takes a personal interest in him and vice versa. Wesley wisely wonders why the computer game Riker brought back from shore leave so quickly became popular or rather addictive before he tries it as they all insist. He discovers it stimulates the pleasure center but affects the higher brain functions, and Data wasn't incapacitated by accident but disconnected by players because android computer brains are immune for the game. Alas, by now Wesley is the only unaffected human, all the others hunt him down after Picard took orders for the game's distribution to other ships and bases from tailing Ktarian ship commander Etana Jol.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Everyone on board the Enterprise welcomes the return of Cadet Wesley Crusher who is on two weeks leave from Starfleet Academy.
