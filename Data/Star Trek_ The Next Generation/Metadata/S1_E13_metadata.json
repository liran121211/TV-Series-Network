It's taken many years for them to receive the distress call and they're not sure what to expect. They do know that Angel One is a matriarchal society where women are the stronger and men adopt a more subservient role. They face an unusual problem when they find the survivors. As for Riker, he has to tread carefully when the planet's leader, Beata, takes an interest in him. Aboard the Enterprise Picard and Dr. Crusher have their own crisis when a severe flu epidemic strikes the crew.\u2014garykmcd", "Passing by, the Enterprise expected a warm welcome when calling on the long-neglected friendly planet Angel One, where females dominate public life, as first federation vessel in many years. But the matriarchal leader Beata sounds cold and almost reluctant to help with the search for survivors from a stranded cargo vessel. Riker leads the ship's delegation and not only overcomes the hostility but sort of enjoys excessive romantic interest from Beata. The Enterprise is quarantined due to a flu-like alien infection out of control. Riker's companions, female except Data, meanwhile discover that the survivors, lead by Ramsey, have fled the Angel capital to barely accessible planet confines. they refuse to be repatriated, and can't be forced, but the Anhel government insists, considering them a threat to the matriarchy, punishable by death.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708676", "rating": 5.7, "votes": 4111, "number_of_episodes": 176}
