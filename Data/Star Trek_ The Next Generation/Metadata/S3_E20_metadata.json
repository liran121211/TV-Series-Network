The cone-shaped object is in orbit around a sun in territory claimed by the Romulans. Tam Elbrun is in contact with the creature but even he is having difficulty dealing with the vast knowledge Tin Man seems to hold. Counselor Troi knows Tam, who was born with his telepathic abilities turned on, something that most Betazoid children, who normally get their abilities at puberty, will not be capable of managing and which often leads to death. Tam and Data go aboard Tin Man and Tam makes it clear that he has no intention of leaving. All the while, the Enterprise has to deal with Romulan war birds.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708831", "rating": 7.2, "votes": 3670, "number_of_episodes": 176}
