Half in jest, Picard says its Eden-like playground seems too good to be true. Alas, it is, for while teaching native adolescents football, Wesley unwittingly commits a minor transgression in a zone where all errors incur but one punishment: death by painless injection. Back aboard the Enterprise, senior officers struggle with an entity defying every known law of nature, which faces and tests them. It turns out to be Edo's 'god', fiercely protective of its 'children', absorbing all Federation knowledge from their database and intending to hold them to their laws. Violating the Prime Directive to save Wesley might arouse its fatal wrath.\u2014KGF Vissers", "After dropping off some colonists in a nearby system, the crew visits a world of beautiful, healthy and tanned humanoids who seem to have a peaceful and loving lifestyle, knowing no crime, war or hardship. They seem to have everything. They also have a death penalty for any infraction of the rules - and a secret.\u2014R.K. Warner", "After a difficult mission re-populating a nearby planet, shore leave would seem to be in order for the nearly exhausted crew. They think they've found the ideal place for a bit of rest and recreation with a local population made up of beautiful, open, honest and very, very friendly people. Picard sends Riker and an away team to check if local conditions are as ideal as they seem on the surface. Too late they learn that, while the people are all that they have been made out to be, they also have only one form of punishment regardless of the severity of any transgression: death. When Wesley Crusher damages some flowers, he is caught by Mediators who are judge, jury and executioner. Picard has no intention of letting any member of his crew be executed but has to find a way to do so that will respect the local culture as well as the Federation's prime directive.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708739", "rating": 6.0, "votes": 4481, "number_of_episodes": 176}
