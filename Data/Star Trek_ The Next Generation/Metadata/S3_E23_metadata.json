His arrival is accompanied with a rash of unusual emotional outbursts among the crew.", "Spock's father Sarek, the legendary Vulcan ambassador, now remarried to another Earth-woman, Perrin, boards the Enterprise to crown his career -before retiring - by finalizing painstakingly prepared peace negotiations with the Legarans. His chief of staff and personal assistant asked Sarek to be given maximal rest in view of his weak health, but he insists on attending the ship's Mozart concert starring Data as violin soloist in his honor, and is seen there to cry, unknown for a Vulcan. Over the next several days more crew members display unprovoked aggression, even toward friends and relatives. Data gets an entourage member to confirm a medical theory: Sarek is affected by the rare Bendii Syndrome, which causes old Vulcans to lose their most-prized emotional self-control, and telepathically spreads the epidemic. Picard must think of the negotiations with the probably susceptible Legarians, which cannot be delayed, while Sarek denies his condition, alas tellingly emotionally; once he admits it, a daring alternative is conceived.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise is scheduled to host major treaty negotiations between the Federation and the Legarans. Representing the Federation is the legendary Vulcan Ambassador Sarek who arrives on board with his wife, an Earth human by the name of Perrin. Things are not well on the Enterprise, as crew members are frequently snapping at one another and at one point, a huge brawl breaks out in Ten Forward. They soon realize that this odd behavior coincides with Sarek's arrival on board ship. Dr. Crusher suspects he may be suffering from Bendii Syndrome, a form of mental degeneration. As the Legarans will only negotiate with Sarek, Captain Picard suggests a unique solution.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708769", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 4122, "number_of_episodes": 176}
