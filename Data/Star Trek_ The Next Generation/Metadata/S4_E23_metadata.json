Crusher ignores the fact that her humanoid lover's body has an alien symbiont in his entrails, but Counselor Deanna Troi empathically senses emotional swings which set her on the trail. An unrequested escort vessel from the Beta Moon then approaches and attacks the Enterprise shuttle which Commander Will Riker was piloting to take the ambassador to his destination. When Riker brings Odan back to the Enterprise badly wounded, Crusher's diagnosis reveals the 'parasite' and she learns his true identity. Odan urgently needs another humanoid host to perform his peace mission, for which task Riker volunteers.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Dr. Crusher has fallen hopelessly in love with Ambassador Odan who is aboard the Enterprise en route to negotiate a truce between two warring parties. When they arrive at their destination, Odan insists on being transported to the planet's surface by shuttle craft rather than the transporter. The shuttle is attacked and Odan is severely injured. It's only at that point that they learn that Odan is a Trill made up of a symbiont in a host body. As it will take some time for a new replacement host body to arrive they transfer the symbiont into Riker's body to allow the negotiations. Dr. Crusher is now ill at ease with her lover in Riker's body but she is in for a greater shock when the new host arrives.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708800", "rating": 6.4, "votes": 3296, "number_of_episodes": 176}
