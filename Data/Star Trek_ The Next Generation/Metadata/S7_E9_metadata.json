DaiMon Prak's large Ferengi ship, the prime suspect, is stranded. He denies having attacked first, but helps with the search in exchange for engineering repairs. Geordi tries to boost the sensors as a matter of rivalry with his former classmate, and gets Data to try to 'train' cat Spot, who is of course too smart to be manipulated. The Enterprise runs into an immobilizing field, then gets boarded by Hekaian sibling doctors Rabal and Serova, who claim warp fields have fatal effects for their planetary population. They admit to having immobilized ships by buoys to make the Federation sit up, a theory Data can't verify for sure. Serova hijacks the Fleming to prove her theory at the ultimate price.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708717", "rating": 6.3, "votes": 2988, "number_of_episodes": 176}
