Dr. Farallon demonstrates the Exocomp, a revolutionary power grid repair device needed to keep the fountain operational, which creates its own tools and learns from its experience. Picard allows 48 hours more for Data to help Farallon. After performing efficiently, it suddenly burns out, but later self-repairs. Data realizes this only makes sense as a self-preservation move, and therefore hopes it's now a living machine, like himself; the theory is tested.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708820", "rating": 7.4, "votes": 3161, "number_of_episodes": 176}
