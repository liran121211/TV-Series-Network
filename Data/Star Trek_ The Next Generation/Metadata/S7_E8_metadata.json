Instead of beaming Kes ambassador Mauric aboard, Picard wakes up incarcerated with Dr. Crusher, both fitted by the Prytt (who fear a military Kes-Federation alliance against them) with an implant communicating their thoughts to each other, so they intensely examine their relationship. This forces the pair to stay close after they find and follow escape clues delivered by undercover Kes operatives. Denied diplomacy by the Prytt, Commander Riker invites Mauric's help, but he sets up shop aboard with suspicious paranoia, while promising to extract the hostages.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708678", "rating": 7.5, "votes": 3096, "number_of_episodes": 176}
