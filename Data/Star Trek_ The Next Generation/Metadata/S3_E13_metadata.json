The tractor beam proves too weak; then suddenly the dreaded Q appears aboard, naked, claiming to be stripped of his omnipotence too, thrown out of the Continuum and forced to chose a mortal life form: human. While Q makes a brilliant engineering suggestion and wrestles with the human condition, the Calimarane, a species with a grudge against him, and next a deus ex machina appears...\u2014KGF Vissers", "While trying to assist a planet threatened with collision by an asteroidal moon, a naked Q suddenly appears on the bridge. It seems that Q is being punished by the Continuum and he selected to become a human on board the Enterprise. All of their instruments indicate that Q is in fact human and is not, as they had originally feared, responsible for the moon that is falling out of its orbit. Q begins to feel everything that a human does - hunger, pain, emotions. The ship is also being probed by an outside force that seems to have a complaint against Q, who now expects his fellow humans to protect him. In the end, Q realizes there is only one solution for him.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708699", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 4616, "number_of_episodes": 176}
