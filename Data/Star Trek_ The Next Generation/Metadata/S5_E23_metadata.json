The drone begins to reassert his individuality, but his presence causes differing levels of fear and sympathy from various crew members.", "Prospecting the Argolis Cluster as potential Federation colonization area, the Enterprise receives a message from a viable moon of the fourth planet- it's a crashed Borg craft emitting a homing signal with four crew corpses and a single male survivor, who is beamed aboard as Dr. Crusher's medical help was needed. Geordi repairs his cyborg technical parts and Beverly his biological organs. During further tests he proves surprisingly cooperative in order to be 'fed' energy, they rename 'Third of Five' Hugh and although even alone he still talks as 'we' he proves quite open, Hugh learns to understand human resistance to assimilation to the Borg collective. Data and Geordi have devised an unsolvable geometrical problem which should cause the Borg collective intelligence to break-down in overload, but after Picard, speaking as the Borg Locutus, finds Hugh has become a true friend of Geordi, refusing to help assimilate him, moral doubts cause asylum aboard being offered to Hugh, who however has dutiful reservations.\u2014KGF Vissers", "After locating a small Borg ship that has crashed on an isolated planet, the sole survivor is brought on board the Enterprise for treatment. The general reaction to a Borg being on the ship is one of fear and hate and most everyone thinks it should be destroyed. The captain has a better plan however - infect it with a computer program and return him him to the collective. The Borg is young and identifies himself as Third of Five but Geordi, who takes quite a liking to him, decides to give him a name: Hugh. Gradually, Hugh becomes less of a Borg and more human-like creating a dilemma for Captain Picard who still has nightmares over his own absorption into the Borg collective.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708732", "rating": 8.8, "votes": 4648, "number_of_episodes": 176}
