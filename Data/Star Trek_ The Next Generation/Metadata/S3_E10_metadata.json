Picard struggles to decide if he is to be believed.", "Data was discovering the human condition by Shakespearian acting, when Picard gets informed a craft entered the Neutral Zone. It's identified as a Romulan scout, which claims to need urgently asylum from a persecutor. The wounded Setol gets it, and warns the Romulans nearly finished building a base on a planet in the Neutral Zone, in order to occupy it and from there strike 15 neighboring Federation zones with a fleet of war birds, which would mean another full war, but still remains rather defensive, at times hostile. Commander Riker and counselor Troi are charged with questioning him further, in case it's a ploy to lure them into the zone as a war pretext. The admiralty refuses the Empire's demand to return the defector, and orders Picard to find out if the threat is real. After technological means came to contradictory conclusions, Setol discloses his real identity, and that's not the last surprising twist...\u2014KGF Vissers", "Romulan officer Sub-Lt. Setol is found fleeing a Romulan Warbird and seeks to defect to the Federation. He informs Captain Picard that a Romulan fleet is amassing and they will soon attack the Federation. Setol doesn't see himself as a traitor but more someone who abhors unnecessary conflict. As a result, he's a bit short on detail and both Picard and Starfleet Command are understandably dubious and strongly suspect that he is a plant. When Setol is identified as an Admiral and not a junior officer, their view of him hardens considerably. When they discover weak signals emanating from a planet in the Neutral Zone, it appears that Setol may be right. In fact, something far more complex is at play.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708792", "rating": 8.4, "votes": 4494, "number_of_episodes": 176}
