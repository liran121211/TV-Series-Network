Commander Data has agreed to speak a complete record of a day in his functioning for the benefit of scientific android engineer Commander Maddox and concludes that his programming must be improved concerning interaction with human emotions - most puzzling given human practices such as irony. Chief Miles O'Brien's human wedding is amply confusing, even for Worf; bride Keiko Ishikawa's gibbers even more illogical. Learning dances and which are appropriate from Dr. Crusher proves easy. Arthur Conan Doyle's logic of elimination Data soon masters, in time to solve a mysterious accident during negotiations with a Romulan admiral.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Lt.
