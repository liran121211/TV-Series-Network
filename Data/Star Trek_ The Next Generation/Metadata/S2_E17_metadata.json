Dr. Pulaski also wants Captain Picard to stop there and undergo a medical procedure he would prefer no one know about. The two of them set off for the base in a shuttle craft and along the way form a bond. Riker and others are puzzled by Picard's sudden decision to go to the base but the ship is soon off responding to a distress call sent by a Pakled vessel. They seem to have only limited knowledge of engineering and how to make the necessary repairs to its engines. The Enterprise is more than happy to help out but the Pakled are not as simple-minded as they seem and have their own plans for the Enterprise.\u2014garykmcd", "When Wesley boards a shuttle-craft to pass Starfleet Academy exams at star base 515, he's joined by captain Picard, who wants to avoid any crew knowing about his cardiac problems, hence refused being operated on by Dr. Pulaski. When conversation properly takes off, they acknowledge a father-son-like relationship and confide their fears and some anecdotes in each-other. Riker, ignoring why he's now in command of an astronomical observation mission Picard was interested in, has to interrupt it to let Geordi assist a broken-down vessel of the intellectually immature Pakled race. However their malfunction was only a ploy to seize Starfleet's most advanced technology.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708768", "rating": 6.5, "votes": 3580, "number_of_episodes": 176}
