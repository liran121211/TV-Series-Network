Meanwhile the Enterprise is hosting Klingon special ambassador Kell, who doesn't enjoy his mission from the High Council to Krios, a planet on the border of Federation space territory, which seeks independence at a time the Klingon Empire needs its resources elsewhere and therefore prefers to settle, and investigate if they get any illegal Federation help. The Klingon Governor Vagh claims the rebels got Federation issue weapons, but Data and Geordi find it's a replica, probably Romulan solely to estrange the Klingons from their enemy, the Federation. The plot thickens when the ambassador actually has control of Geordi, ordering him to execute an assassination attempt on the governor. However Dr. Crusher's medical examination of Georgi's eye complaints put Data on the track of the sinister plot.\u2014KGF Vissers", "While en route to a conference by shuttle craft, Lt. Cmdr. Geordi La Forge is kidnapped by Romulans. He is brainwashed by his Romulan captors and returns to the Enterprise as if nothing has happened. Also aboard the Enterprise is Klingon Ambassador Kell who is traveling to Kreos where Klingon Governor Vagh claims local rebels fighting for their independence are being armed by the Federation. Testing of the weapons Governor Vagh has seized confirm that they are of Romulan origin. Geordi has been brainwashed into being an assassin but his controller is already on board the Enterprise and is simply awaiting the right moment to direct La Forge to his target.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708808", "rating": 7.7, "votes": 3415, "number_of_episodes": 176}
