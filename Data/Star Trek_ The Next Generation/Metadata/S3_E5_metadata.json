Marla Aster, who leaves behind a teenager son, Jeremy. After Lieutenant Worf, the Klingon orphan raised by humans who commanded his mother's landing party, talked with Jeremy, while Wesley Crusher, the crew member closest in age to the boy, still needs to consider how to share the experience of being orphaned, suddenly a woman appears, who pretends to Jeremy to be his late mother, coming to take him to their new home on the planet, where some activity is observed, which even taps into the ships own energy. When Deanna Troi convinces the boy neither his mother nor a safe home on the planet can be real, she disappears, the ship is attacked, she reappears and an energy form intrudes the Enterprise. Maybe persuasion works better in his interest on Jeremy's would be-substitute mother, who explains the planet's history?.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise have to deal with the delicate matter of informing Jeremy Aster that his mother, ship's archaeologist Lt. Marla Aster has been killed while on an away team lead by Lt. Worf. The boy's grieving process is interrupted when an alien being takes Lt. Aster's physical form and wants to relocate the boy to the planet below. Lt. Worf for his part has his own feelings of guilt over Aster's death and wants to perform a ceremony to make the now orphaned Jeremy his brother. Troi counsels against it at this time, given that Jeremy has yet to grieve and fully understand his loss. The Captain asks Wesley Crusher to speak to over the loss of his own father, something Wesley finds very difficult to do.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708788", "rating": 6.7, "votes": 3695, "number_of_episodes": 176}
