Klingon captain K'Vada isn't amused when Data claims he may be able to crack the Romulan encryption log. As Vulcan-human half-blood Spock and android Data exchange views on the virtues of emotional and cool logical qualities, Commander Riker's investigation into a stolen Vulcan ship continues, starting with the mundane wife of the smuggler who died while pursued and finds a Barolian ship was involved. Spock and Picard fear rightly it all ties together in a Romulan war plot to take over Vulcan.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Senator Pardek arranges for Spock and Picard to meet, but the Vulcan, feeling that his visit to Romulus is a private and personal attempt at peace, is not pleased to see the Enterprise captain. He reveals his attempt to unify the two cultures who have the same roots. Picard accuses him of cowboy diplomacy and questions whether unification can ever be achieved. On the Enterprise, Riker tracks down the Ferengi merchant whose partner stole a Vulcan ship from the junkyard and learns to whom he sold it. It's all part of a Romulan plot led by Sela to not only quash any attempt at unification but to take over Vulcan as well. Spock deals with his recently deceased father's thoughts and feelings inside Picard as a result from a previous mind meld with Jean-Luc.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708836", "rating": 8.3, "votes": 3795, "number_of_episodes": 176}
