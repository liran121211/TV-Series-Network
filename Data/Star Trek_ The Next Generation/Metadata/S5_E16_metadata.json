Worf quickly asks Riker, as his best friend aboard, to assist him in Hegh'bat, the Klingon suicide for a permanently disabled warrior, to save his and his family's dignity. Crusher's visiting scientific friend Toby Russell proudly shows her an invention in development, the genetronic replicator, which she believes can scan and reproduce the damaged neuro-system even in Worf's case, but he would be the first humanoid test-patient so Crusher is against. Pride makes Worf decline either seeing his son Alexander or trying implants which can restore 60% of his motor-functions. The Enterprise goes assist the USS Denver, with many patients in need of medical help after a Cardassian attack, but after Crusher sees Russell use an experimental drug on one of them has her thrown off the ship. Picard pleads to let her return and reconsider the replicator, as Worf can't accept her alternative. Riker finds Klingon tradition dictates the suicide-assistance be left to the closest kin, and even Worf can't ask this from his half-human boy.\u2014KGF Vissers", "After a cargo bay container falls on him, Lt. Worf awakens to find that he has lost the use of his legs. For a Klingon, physical ability is paramount and he can see only one choice ahead of him: to take his own life. He asks Commander Riker to assist him and though he does't approve, Riker agrees to help. Meanwhile, Dr. Crusher arranges for the visit of a top-notch surgeon, Dr. Toby Russell, who has an experimental surgical procedure that could help Worf. Crusher begins to have doubts when she sees to what extent Russell is prepared to risk patient lives in order to try a new drug or a new procedure. She believes Russell is unethical in her approach to medicine and medical research and doesn't hesitate to tell Captain Picard so. Given the options available, the experimental surgery is authorized.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708709", "rating": 7.2, "votes": 3318, "number_of_episodes": 176}
