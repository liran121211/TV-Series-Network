The Enterprise's present Captain Edward Jellico believes the negotiations with the Cardassians are heading for war, especially now Picard's failed intrusion is reported by the scandalized Cardassians. Picard is stripped naked and suspended by the wrists for a thirsty night before torture by a pain-inducing implant made with a jevonite knife. The Cardassians prove to Jellico that Picard is captured but deny the agent POW status, so he will suffer a terrorist's fate unless the Federation admits starting a war or retreats from the sector. After scanning the Cardassian ship for indications where they were, Jellico, Data and Geordi guess right - Picard was tricked to betray the Federation defense plans for Minos Kordas and get permission to make a bold countermove, requiring best pilot Riker, who openly disapproves of Jellico's cold style and attitude. As Picard resists physical pain, psychological torture by lies is used, but he also finds a way to retort there.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Having been captured by the Cardassians, who, having used theta band emissions as a ruse to lure Captain Picard into their hands, begin several rounds of torture to gain the information they seek, while, back on the Enterprise, the diplomatic negotiations are severely strained between Captain Jellico and the Cardassian envoy as details surrounding Picard's mission and fate are revealed.\u2014Moviedude1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708687", "rating": 8.9, "votes": 4314, "number_of_episodes": 176}
