His latest trial goes terribly wrong, causing a time-distorting ripple to spread from a binary star system, tapping into unimaginable energy that already affects the Enterprise crew. To prevent the galaxy being ripped open, the process must be reversed, although gravely (maybe fatally) injured Manheim can only give unreliable instructions to Data. Jean-Luc Picard is largely focused on Paul's younger wife Jenice, once Jean-Luc's fianc\u00e9e, whom he dumped in Paris for his Starfleet dream.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The crew of the Enterprise races against time itself when a scientist experiments with time and claims to have opened a window into another dimension, which must be closed. And Picard races against his past, as the scientist's wife turns out to be an old flame that almost turned him away from Starfleet.\u2014Moviedude1", "The Enterprise responds to a distress signal sent by the eminent Dr. Manheim, a renowned physicist conducting experiments with time that have opened portals to other dimensions. The result - a ripple through time and space, affecting the Enterprise crew with moments of deja vu, where interactions suddenly repeat themselves. Manheim, dying, is beamed aboard with his wife Jenice, and it is left to Data, least confused during distortions, to close the portal Manheim has opened. For Picard, however, the encounter with the Manheims is a personal challenge, for Jenice was once the love of his life that forced him to choose between her and his career in Starfleet. That he chose the latter does not change the love he once had for her and the emotions he feels at seeing her again.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708840", "rating": 6.5, "votes": 3767, "number_of_episodes": 176}
