The entire population of the planet died of unknown reasons many years previously with Data being found just around that time. Although they find no one alive, they do find a huge underground complex and, surprisingly, a disassembled version of Data. They re-build him and once activated, he introduces himself as Lor, an earlier and, he claims, a superior version of Data. He claims he was disassembled because he was so human-like that he frightened the local population. In fact, he knows far more than he is letting on and has the ability to call upon a crystalline entity of great destructive power, the very power that destroyed the planet and killed all of its inhabitants. All he has to do is find a way to impersonate Data.\u2014garykmcd", "The crew is curious about a first visit to planet Omicron Theta, where Data was found when the earthly colonists there were wiped out mysteriously but fast. The away party returns with the components for an android just like Data, which is assembled aboard as similarly as possible. It claims being an older and better version of 'brother' Data, named Lore, which has more empathy with humans and certainly demonstrates superior grasp of human language and thought. Wesley is dismissed as if a rude brat when he honestly vents rising suspicions given their discredited human creator and the approach of a crystalline life form, which killed the colonists.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708698", "rating": 7.6, "votes": 4503, "number_of_episodes": 176}
