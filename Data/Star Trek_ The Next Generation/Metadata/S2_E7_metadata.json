Caught among its victims - Dr. Pulaski.", "The Enterprise, en route to Star Station India, receives a distress signal from the USS Lantree, a Federation supply ship. When they arrive, they find everyone aboard dying of what seems to be old age. They proceed to the Lantree's last port of call, the Darwin genetic research facility on Gagarin IV only to find that they too are suffering from rapid aging. Picard and Dr. Pulaski clash when she brings aboard one of the children from the station and, in order to complete her examination, takes him aboard a shuttle craft to isolate him from the Enterprise crew. She is soon infected, however, and seems doomed to die of old age, but Picard may have a solution.\u2014garykmcd", "Answering Federation cargo USS Lantree's weak, disappearing distress call, the Enterprise finds every person aboard dead from extremely accelerated aging, cause unknown, so they quarantine and mark it. Checking its last 'port' of call - genetic research station Gagarin IV on an isolated planet - they find its staff afflicted with the same epidemic, albeit in an early stage. Picard isn't inclined to take aboard the station's genetically improved children from the contaminated base, even though none show any symptoms. Dr. Pulaski, who has a relevant research background, persuades him to allow beaming one child to a safe space - a drifting shuttle manned by her and presumably immune Data. The brief contact infects her, so she joins the quarantine, but theoretically a cure may be found by adjusting the very transporter she always tries to avoid.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise responds to a distress call from the USS Lantree and find her crew dead, apparently from old age. The investigation leads them to a research station on Gagarin IV, where Pulaski and the station's staff undergo rapid aging from genetically enhanced children.\u2014Akira <akira625@comcast.net>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708837", "rating": 6.5, "votes": 3676, "number_of_episodes": 176}
