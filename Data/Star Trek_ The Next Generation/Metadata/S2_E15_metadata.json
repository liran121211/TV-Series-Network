As the person in charge of Wesley Crusher's training and education, Commander Riker wants to put him in charge of the planetary mineral survey, the results of which should explain why the system has become so unstable. He has to command a team for the first time, all of whom are older than himself. Data meanwhile has a pen pal of sorts when he establishes radio contact with Sarjenka, a young girl from a nearby planet. They exchange information for several weeks when Data finally realizes that Sarjenka's world isn't aware of extra-terrestrial life and as a result, he has broken the Prime Directive.\u2014garykmcd", "Ensign Wesley Crusher is delighted to get his first training taste of command, leading a scientific survey of the Selcundi Drema sector planetary systems, rich in precious deuterium but at risk of being torn apart by natural processes, which might be controlled. Wesley wrestles to balance the assignment to take charge with his Cartesian doubt and natural regard for his team members' reserves. Data is in danger of disregarding the Federation's anti-intervention First Direction by resuming radio contact with Sarjenka, a young girl from a Drema planet in danger of explosion. Rather then disregarding her call for help, he beams down unauthorized and brings her aboard.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise investigates the Selcundi Drema region of space, where planets tear themselves apart. During Data's investigation of signals, he becomes radio pen pals with a little girl named Sarjenka who lives on Drema IV. When Data discovers that her planet is in danger of imminent destruction, he informs the Captain that he has broken the Prime Directive by talking to someone from a planet without space travel. Meanwhile, William Riker puts Wesley Crusher in charge of the mineral surveys to determine what causes the quakes and volcanic eruptions on the various planets in order to further Wesley's education as a Starfleet ensign. Wesley is talked out of ordering a time-consuming analysis by an older crew member under his command. After talking to Riker, Wesley gains the confidence to order the tests, which quickly reveal the cause of the geological disturbances, and Picard agrees to help save the planet. After Data loses his connection to the girl, he beams down to the planet to find her and returns her to the ship. The Enterprise saves the planet and, after the girl's mind is wiped of her memories of Data, she is beamed back to her now-safe planet.\u2014Michael W Hughes"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708754", "rating": 6.8, "votes": 3755, "number_of_episodes": 176}
