Barclay mistakenly awakes Moriarty in the forgotten holodeck program, who then makes his demands clear and unforgettable.", "Diagnosing anomalies in the Sherlock Holmes holodeck programs, Lieutenant Reginald 'Reg' Barclay III discovers a protected memory program containing the self-aware arch-villain character Professor James Moriarty, who demands fulfillment of an overdue promise by the crew to think up a way for him to leave the holodeck. To Picard's astonishment, Moriarty proves empirically that his will suffices for him to leave the holodeck and retain his physical body. Picard grants him the benefit of the doubt of a reformed character, despite his crimes in fiction, but refuses to additionally grant life to the Countess Bartholomew, who was created as his ideal but holographic mate. Moriarty seizes control of the Enterprise to force the crew to make good on their promise at pain of total destruction. That still leaves the technological challenge, but Data's logical deduction comes up with an entirely different viewpoint, inspiring another challenge and approach.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise journeys to observe the birth of a star from a unique collision of two gas giant planets. Fiddling with the controls in one the holodecks, Lt. Barclay inadvertently unlocks Data's Sherlock Holmes mystery, which includes Holmes' arch nemesis, Professor Moriarity. Since the professor was promised by the crew some time ago that they would try to figure out a way for him to leave the holodeck, he seeks to discuss his situation with Captain Picard. His demands to be able to leave the Holodeck are not taken seriously enough till he takes control of the starship: unless the professor and his artificial beloved, the Countess Barthalomew, are allowed to leave the ship on their own, he will destroy the Enterprise and its crew.\u2014Good2Go"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708773", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 3939, "number_of_episodes": 176}
