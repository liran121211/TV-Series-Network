Capt. Picard receives the Stargazer, a ship considered lost that he once commanded.", "The Enterprise is ordered to rendezvous with a Ferengi vessel for reasons that are not made clear to Capt.

Picard is please to see his old ship but has been suffering from headaches lately. With Dr. Crusher concerned, the Captain just goes on as usual. Picard's condition worsens as it is revealed a member of the Ferengi crew is out to avenge the death of his son in the battle for which Picard gained such recognition.
