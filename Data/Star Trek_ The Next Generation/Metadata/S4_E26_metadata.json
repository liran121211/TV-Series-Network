Worf must decide where their priorities lie as the Klingon Empire descends into a bitter civil war.", "The Enterprise goes on the Klingon homeworld to attend the installation of Gowron as the new head of the High Council. Captain Picard encourages Lt. Worf to seize the opportunity to clear his name. However Gowron boards, asking hasty help to prevent a Klingon civil war, claiming the sisters of the late traitor Duras head a corrupt conspiracy supported by at least three fleet commanders, Picard is the only established acceptable arbitrator. Gowron scorned Worf, before he tells Duras' father was the traitor to the Romulans - only to be told it's too late given the Duras faction in the Council. Worf arranges a leave to visit his brother Kurn, serving on a Klingon ship - he feels both old factions must be swept away, four commanders would side with their family. Worf pulls rank as family eldest, ordering loyalty to the confirmed Gowron, only later their support would be made dependent upon family rehabilitation. Picard is about to complete Gowron's installation, but the Duras family - secretly in league with the Romulans - challenges his in the name of a minor, who they claim to be the illegitimate son and heir, a matter for the arbitrator to decide, in his favor. The first hostilities go well enough for Gowron to be installed by Picard. Then a major Duras fleet appears and Picard refuses the military help requested by Gowron and Worf, who then declines to resume his post when leaves are canceled, so he honorably resigns to keep fighting at Gowron's side...\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708762", "rating": 8.4, "votes": 3712, "number_of_episodes": 176}
