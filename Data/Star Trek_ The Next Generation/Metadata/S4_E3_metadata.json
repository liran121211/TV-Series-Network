Commander Data inexplicably hijacks the Enterprise. He transports himself to a planet and finds his creator, Dr. Noonien Soong, alive and well. Data has no recollection of events prior to arriving on the planet. The elderly doctor has activated a homing device in Data as a way of bringing him home. They are both surprised however when Data's brother, Lore, also appears. The Doctor had no idea Lore had been reactivated and the homing signal intended only for Data obviously called Lore home as well. The doctor tells them that he is dying but that doesn't stop the brothers from bickering. The reason the doctor called Data home was to provide him with a new chip to give him emotions. Lore has his own plans however.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708683", "rating": 7.7, "votes": 3891, "number_of_episodes": 176}
