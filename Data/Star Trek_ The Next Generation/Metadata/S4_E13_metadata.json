Picard is told she is known by many names in various systems, all frightening and almost almighty, but he refuses to believe she's the planet's version of the Devil, and decides to challenge her legal claim. Data finds under the planet's law the only possible way is by choosing an arbitrator - she proposes ever objective Data, who warns Picard he will be impartial, and is accepted...\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise responds to a distress call from a planet where the population is certain that their planet is coming to an end.

The planet's leaders agree that their forebears had signed such an agreement and are now prepared to meet their side of the bargain. Captain Picard isn't so sure and assigns his crew to find a scientific explanation for what's happening. Ardra is certainly convincing but Picard accuses her of being nothing more than a magician. To resolve the dispute, Picard and Ardra agree to put their case before an impartial arbitrator: Data.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708702", "rating": 7.2, "votes": 3727, "number_of_episodes": 176}
