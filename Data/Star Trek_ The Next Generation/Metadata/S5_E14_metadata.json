A suddenly approaching alien ship uses scanners so strong that all crew members including Data lose most of their personal memories, even names and ranks, yet retain their operational and language skills. The external communications are down and computer data banks have been selectively wiped. Some, including the ship's manifest, are altered, so as to make a Commander MacDuff Executive Officer (rather than Riker) and the Enterprise is on a crucial mission in a war the Federation had been conducting for years against the Lysian race. The alien ship has been destroyed, they assume by the Enterprise, although there's no battle damage. While crew members behave differently, failing their normal reference patterns, MacDuff volunteers for a memory therapy Dr. Crusher suggests, so he can pretend for it to fail and press on the attack on the Lysian headquarters, but the war logic doesn't quite add up.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise suddenly realize that their memory has been wiped and they have no idea who they are. For some reason, they have retained their ability to run the ship but they have no idea who among them is in command or what each of their individual roles might be. Worf takes command initially but when La Forge finally manages to access the ship's roster, a command structure takes shape. According to the roster however, the first officer is Commander MacDuff with Riker as second officer. They are also at war and while MacDuff argues they should destroy the enemy as per orders, Picard begins to doubt they would have a sworn enemy whose technology comes nowhere near matching that of the Enterprise.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708693", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 3867, "number_of_episodes": 176}
