The team's leader, Kurt Mandl, isn't very welcoming stating that they are very busy but Picard insists with Riker, Data and Geordi beaming down to the planet. Velara III was selected because of its complete absence of any life forms and the terraforming initiative takes about 30 years. The team is now in the process of removing salts from the natural water supply as the first step in creating a sustainable environment. Geordi and Data come across a non-carbon based object that glows and give the appearance of life. When it attempts to communicate with the crew, it is obvious they have encountered a life form like no other.\u2014garykmcd", "Riker, Data and Geordi eagerly form a landing party to visit potentially hospitable planet Velara III, where Kurt Mandl's specialized Federation science team is building a biosphere to allow human colonization. However, they get a far from unanimously warm welcome, and shortly after their arrival, a scientist is killed by an aggressively reprogrammed laser drill robot, which engages in a duel when Data investigates the presumed accident on site. The only logical explanation is the presence of life, so different that starship sensors don't recognize it, but the scientists are less surprised.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708730", "rating": 6.8, "votes": 3806, "number_of_episodes": 176}
