Enterprise, and its new crew with an array of both humans and non-humans. On their maiden voyage, to Farpoint space station, on the primitive Bandi planet, they come under the apparently inescapable control of alien Q, representative of a technologically superior civilization. He calls humanity backward savages, but accepts to put them to the test at the station. Bandi leader Zorn offers full use of the apparently adequate facilities, but no answers to the key questions, how the station was built, and what agonized feelings Troi is picking up.\u2014KGF Vissers", "In the 24th century, Capt Picard is taking command of the ENTERPRISE-E and picks up crew including his first officer, Will Riker, CMO, Beverly Crusher and her son Wesley.

En route, Picard, his crew are waylaid by an advanced entity, Q, who calls on them to stand trial for the evils of humankind.

Enterprise. En route to the distant Farpoint Station, the Enterprise is captured by a capricious, omnipotent being who calls himself Q. In a court of his own devising, Q judges that, based on its past, humanity is unfit to exist. Picard argues that the human race has outgrown its infancy, and should be judged on its current actions. Q relents, and agrees to monitor the Enterprise's new crew as it investigates a mysterious force at Farpoint Station.\u2014Anonymous", "On the first active duty mission for the crew of the Enterprise-D, they are stopped by an omnipotent being known only as Q. He puts them on trial as the representatives of a species of violent savages. The only way for the crew to prove their accuser wrong is to continue their mission and discover the secret of a mysterious base on a distant planet, seemingly built by a civilization that does not have the technological skill. Furthermore, they have to solve the puzzle in a truly civilized and enlightened manner.\u2014Kenneth Chisholm <kchishol@execulink.com>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0094030", "rating": 6.9, "votes": 7779, "number_of_episodes": 176}
