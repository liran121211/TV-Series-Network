The miner host pilot Captain Dirgo's shuttle gets into trouble, having to land in a desert without working replicator or supplies, so Picard decides to walk to the nearest mountains for shelter, persisting even when sensor readings suggest possible life. Riker decides not to return for a search before dealing with the radiation source, which is found to be an abandoned barge and soon starts disintegrating while on tractor beam to an asteroid belt. When Dirgo foolishly fires a phaser on a protective column, which mysteriously forms around a fountain at approach, the cave collapses on Picard, and Wesley's ingenuity is their only hope when Dirgo's equally ill-conceived next attempt proves even more disastrous.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Captain has good news for Wesley Crusher: a position has become available at the Academy and Wesley has been accepted as a cadet.
