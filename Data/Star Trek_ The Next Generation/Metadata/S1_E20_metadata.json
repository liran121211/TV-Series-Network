The messenger, essentially a holographic image, invites them to the planet below. There, the away team led by Commander Riker comes under attack from a myriad of weapons leading Captain Picard and Dr. Crusher to also beam down to the planet. They too are attacked and Dr. Crusher is seriously wounded. Aboard the Enterprise, Lt. Laforge is left in command for the first time in a crisis situation. He not only has to deal with being under attack from these unknown weapons systems, but also deal with a colleague who feels he should be given command of the ship.\u2014garykmcd", "The Enterprise approaches a planet where humanoid life has been exterminated by merciless warfare. A holographic salesman offering novel weapons is ignored by Picard, who leads a party on the planet, but falls in a pit with Dr. Crusher while Riker, Data and Yar must fight off a clever, fast-learning soldier-robot, which disables their ability to communicate and beam back up. Aboard the ship is a command crisis, in the captain and first officer's absence, when it's attacked by a vessel which drives them from orbit.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708783", "rating": 7.1, "votes": 3954, "number_of_episodes": 176}
