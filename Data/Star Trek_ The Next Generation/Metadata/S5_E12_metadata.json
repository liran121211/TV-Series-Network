Deanna Troi, the first crew member to come through it, cannot recall anything surrounding the incident.", "On a mapping journey the Enterprise hosts a party of Ullian 'mind historians', specialists who telepathically retrieve people's long-forgotten memories from many races. Keiko O'Brien and Dr. Crusher enjoy resuscitating pleasant memories, but the overbearing Ullian leader Tarmin's son Jev abuses his abilities on non-volunteers against their code, and enters their thus nightmare-altered memories as a key character, leaving Troi and Riker in apparently unprovoked comas which only resemble the rare Iresine Syndrome, without the associated histamine level change. Then it happens to Crusher the same way, but Troi wakes up after three days, alas with a total black-out. After eliminating any other imaginable causes, Picard has to suspect the Ullians. Troi accepts a memory probe by Jev, who makes her believe it's Tarmin's doing, but Geordi and Data do some research.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise is transporting three Ullian 'mind' historians. They have the ability to assist people in going deep into their memories to recollect events or occurrences that have long been forgotten. To show how it works, they assist Keiko in remembering her grandmother while she painted pictures and hummed a tune. Not long afterwards, however, Counselor Troi is mentally assaulted and is subsequently found in her quarters in a deep coma. Soon after, Commander Riker and Dr. Crusher also fall into deep comas. Captain Picard suspects one of the Ullians of these attacks but determining who among the three is not going to be straightforward.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708839", "rating": 6.2, "votes": 3081, "number_of_episodes": 176}
