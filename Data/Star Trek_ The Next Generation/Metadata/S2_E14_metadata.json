They are stopping at Starbase Montgomery where they are taking a civilian on board to brief Riker on his new assignment. When it turns out to be Riker's father -they haven't seen each other for some 15 years - it seems he knows Dr. Pulaski with whom he obviously at one time had a serious relationship. It takes a physical encounter for father and son to solve their issues. Worf meanwhile has been quite irascible lately and it's left to Wesley Crusher to figure out what he needs. While at the base, the crew is also taking advantage of the facilities to have the engines looked at.\u2014garykmcd", "Due to his exemplary record as flag ship first officer, Commander William T. Riker is offered his own command, aboard a far more modest starship, but in a largely explored intergalactic sector. His mood turns from pensive to ire when he notices the Federation official invited to brief him is none other than his always indisposed, nearly-always-absent father Kyle, who also turns out to be ship medical chief Pulaski's once love. Wesley studiously works out that Worf's worse-than-normal-Klingon mood stems from the frustration of missing out on a virility-transition ritual, so he enlists data and Geordi to enact it on the Holodeck. A martial arts duel helps the Rikers deal with past and truth.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708802", "rating": 6.2, "votes": 3510, "number_of_episodes": 176}
