She is the official Ambassador from Betazed, but that isn't the only reason she is there. She is going through 'The Phase', a time in her life when her sexual drive increases fourfold. She's clearly got her eyes on the Captain, who decides to take refuge on the holodeck as private detective Dixon Hill. With him away, she announces that Commander Riker is her next target, and he soon joins the Captain holed up in the holodeck. She tracks them down, but her sudden interest in a holodeck character serves to rescue the Captain and his First Officer.\u2014garykmcd", "To Troi's dismay, her planet's delegate to the diplomatic conference on planet Pacifica, one of three to be transported by the Enterprise, is none other then her saucy, domineering mother, Lwaxanna, whose latest outrageous presumption is to 'allow' a human crew officer to become her slavishly adoring husband. Her first choice befalls Picard but, helped by Data's conveniently boring anecdotes to render a private trap/meeting less then romantic, he wriggles out and seeks refuge in a holo-deck detective story. After shifting her interest to Riker, she tracks Picard down in his fantasy world and, ignoring it's just that, falls for a computer-designed character. Despite lust clouding her shrewd observance, it still proves most useful in dealing with a seemingly harmless delegation.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Deanna Troi's Mother - Lwaxana Troi - shows up on the Enterprise with a plan to marry Captain Jean-Luc Picard. When Captain Picard hides in the holodeck, she announces her engagement to Commander William T. Riker. When Lwaxana finds both men hiding in the holodeck, she falls for a holodeck character.\u2014Michael W Hughes"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708747", "rating": 6.1, "votes": 3576, "number_of_episodes": 176}
