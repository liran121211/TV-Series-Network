An away team finds some systems still powered up and the chief engineer from the old Enterprise, Montgomery Scott, locked in the transporter cycle.", "When the Enterprise locates the missing transport ship USS Jenolan, it's found to be stuck on a round object large enough to cause gravimetric disturbances, which fits the theory of a Dyson sphere, large enough to contain an entire star's powers. Riker's away team investigates the wrecked ship and finds a permanent diagnostic loop in the transporter buffer; Geordi guesses right this was the clever method to survive for 75 years used by two men, one of which has degraded, but the Enterprise's chief engineer from Kirk's days, Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott, is alive and confident he still can be useful. After trying Geordi's patience with his ignorant questions and dangerous presumptions, Scotty feels ready to retire. However, the gravity has both ships locked to the sphere, the star inside is about to release a flare in hours which the shields can't survive, and Scotty, who literally wrote the impulse reactor's manual, can show Geordi the real tolerance margins...\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise responds to a distress signal from the USS Jenolan, a Federation transport ship that was reported missing 75 years ago. It crashed - or was shot down - on the outside surface of a Dyson sphere, a spherical structure large enough to contain a sun and a myriad of planets. They find basic life support systems aboard the craft are still functioning but more interesting they find that someone is in the transporter system. It turns out to be Captain Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott, who was a passenger aboard the vessel. Having been in a form of stasis for 75 years means Scotty is rather a fish out of water when it comes to his new time period, but his knowledge becomes invaluable when the Enterprise is drawn inside the sphere by a tractor beam.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708764", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 4240, "number_of_episodes": 176}
