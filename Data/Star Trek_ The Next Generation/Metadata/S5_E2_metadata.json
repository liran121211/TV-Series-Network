Picard expected fairly easy diplomacy, but the Tamarians first have a row at their side, then transport Picard and their own captain Dathon down to the nearest planet surface, which they make impenetrable behind a particle shield, to pit them for a duel, which Picard is unwilling to engage. Both the captain and his crew on the bridge desperately study the Tamarian language, which they find to be unusually focused on mythical narrative, notably the epic of Darmok, which holds the key to its metaphorical 'code', and thus to the whole situation.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise is sent to formally negotiate with the Tamarians, a race that has recently made contact and seem to want further contact beyond their world. An immediate problem is inability to communicate in any known language. After several attempts to communicate Captain Picard and his Tamaraian counterpart are unexpectedly beamed down to a nearby planet's surface. While the Enterprise crew try to recover Picard and decipher what the Tamarians are trying to say to them, the two Captains are seemingly expected to fight one another, something Picard flatly refuses to do.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708696", "rating": 8.7, "votes": 5492, "number_of_episodes": 176}
