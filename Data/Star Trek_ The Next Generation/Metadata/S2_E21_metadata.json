As part of the exercise, Riker will command an old vessel, the USS Hathaway, and act as the 'enemy'. Riker takes along Laforge, Worf, Wesley Cusher and several others as his crew and their first task is to get the vessel operational. Kolrami is supremely confident and arrogant, convinced that his superior skills will result in an easy victory over Riker. When they are attacked by the Ferengi who want the Hathaway as their prize, Picard and the crew stage a clever deception.\u2014garykmcd", "Given the Borg threat, Picard rescinded his refusal to partake in Starfleet war games. Master strategist Sirna Kolrami, from a haughty but most efficient race, comes preside over a duel between Picard, commanding an Enterpise skeleton crew, and Riker, who can select his own aboard a rackety spaceship. Wesley, Whord and Geordie help not only get it in fighting condition but also improvise weapons and deceptions. Kolrami easily defeats Riker in a side game of some alien chess which he's a grandmaster in, so reluctant Data is 'volunteered' to challenge him for the ship's honor. The arrival of a Ferengi war ship, which finds the Starfeleet vessels disabled, requires deadly earnest, yet Picard waves Kolami's ruthless advice to sacrifice Riker's crew.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise crew is ordered to participates in an elaborate Federation war game - in preparation for the Borg - in which Riker will command an inferior 80 year old ship. The Enterprise is joined by Kolrami who is a battle strategist from Zakdorn, who are know as having the most strategic minds in the known galaxy. Kolrami doesn't believe Riker is any good. However, Riker does a number of clever tricks to even the odds of the mock battle, but then a Ferengi battleship decides to join in since the Enterprise's weapons are off line for the war game. Riker and Picard trick the Ferengi and they flee. Kolarmi then agrees that Riker is one of the best.\u2014Michael W Hughes"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708753", "rating": 7.7, "votes": 3864, "number_of_episodes": 176}
