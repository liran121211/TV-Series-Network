Wesley Crusher suffers the pangs of first love when the Enterprise is tasked to transport a young woman, Salia, back to her home world where she is to become the leader of her people. Traveling with her is her guardian and teacher, Anya, who is more than just a bit overprotective. Wesley very much wants to be with Salia - likewise she with him - but there are few opportunities under Anya's watchful eye. Guinan and others provide Wesley with advice, but when Salia reveals her true self to him, he re-evaluates his feelings.\u2014garykmcd", "The Enterprise is to transport Salia, future ruler, from the grim planet Klavdia III where she was raised to her home planet Daled IV, hoping to end the ancient state of war between culturally and geographically totally opposite peoples, her being descended from both dynasties, and her accompanied by bossy crone governess Anya. Meeting Wesley in passing, sparks fly between them, but protocol and Anya stand in their way, even to meet. As Wesley proves to be dangerously distracted by her presence, Anya grows grimly hostile, revealing their species' unsuspected monstrous nature.\u2014KGF Vissers", "A pretty girl, Salia, comes aboard the Enterprise with her stern, diminutive guardian. She is to be taken to her home planet where she will fulfill her duty as the one to bring peace to warring factions. Wesley falls for the girl and, smitten, becomes no good to anyone. Only later do people find that Salia and her guardian are allomorphs (shape-shifters) when her guardian transforms into a monster that takes on Worf and wins. Salia's ability to turn into a big hairy monster herself is something not as attractive to Wes, souring his ardor.\u2014Don Payette"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708791", "rating": 6.2, "votes": 3875, "number_of_episodes": 176}
