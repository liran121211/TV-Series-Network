Both guests prove meeting opposites, falling in love. The experiment is a partial success, only promising scientific progress without immediate results. Alas the minister in charge refuses to allow Timicin to continue: their law dictates he must commit ritual suicide, called 'The Resolution' when he turns 60 in a few days being then considered a burden for the younger generations, despite his excellent condition of mind and body. Picard has no choice but accept under the Prime Directive, Lwaxana tries to convince her flame by emotions and reason, as nobody is better qualified to continue the crucial research, which strikes a chord.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Deanna Troi's mother Lwaxana is on board the Enterprise visiting her daughter. She sets her sights on Dr. Timicin, a renowned scientist who has come aboard the Enterprise. He believes he has found a way to re-energize his world's dying sun. Timicin takes a liking to her - and she to him - and they commiserate after his experiment fails. She's shocked however when he tells her that he will now be returning to his home planet to die. He's not ill - but he is about to reach the age of 60 at which point it is customary for his kind to end their lives. Lwaxana is understandably upset and she does her best to convince him to break with tradition. He eventually requests political asylum on the Enterprise but in the end finds he has little choice but to his cultural tradition.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708724", "rating": 7.3, "votes": 3563, "number_of_episodes": 176}
