Two of the six people aboard get killed as there's no time left to beam aboard properly because the cargo was sent first, yet the other two crew members seem to care only for the freight. Their passengers, from their neighbor planet, contest ownership because their agreed payment aboard the freighter was lost. It's their only produce, vital for the other planet since it was struck by a general plague, yet Dr. Crusher soon realizes it's not really medicine as they have no plague symptoms, yet suffer immensely without it.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise rescues four people off a space freighter just as the ship burns up in a planet's atmosphere. The foursome represent the peoples of two planets who have had a long trading relationship. In fact, they were on their way to deliver medicine to combat a centuries-old plague that has afflicted one of the planets. With the destruction of their ship, however, the question of payment becomes the major issue to be resolved. For Picard, remaining neutral is key but when the medicine turns out to be something else entirely, the role of the Prime Directive also comes into play.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708781", "rating": 6.9, "votes": 3950, "number_of_episodes": 176}
