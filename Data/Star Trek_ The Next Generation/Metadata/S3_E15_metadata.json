To everyone's surprise, the ship is an earlier version of the Enterprise, the Enterprise-C commanded by Captain Rachel Garrett. The instant the Enterprise-C arrives however, history is changed. Captain Picard and his Enterprise are battle weary with the Federation having been at war with the Klingon Empire for 20 years. Lt. Tasha Yar is alive with Lt. Worf nowhere to be found. Guinan knows something is wrong and Picard realizes that the Enterprise-C must return to its own time and place if their time line is to be restored.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708845", "rating": 9.2, "votes": 6522, "number_of_episodes": 176}
