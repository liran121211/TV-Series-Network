Just then Counselor Deanna Troi finds herself devoid of her empathic powers, an inexplicable loss of control she finds more than terrifying. Indeed she hands in her resignation. Every attempt to fight the aliens fails, and it's forcing the Enterprise straight to fatal danger. At the last moment Deanna comes up with a 'two-dimensional theory'.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise finds itself in the control of an unknown alien entity and being dragged into a wormhole of sorts from which they and the ship will not survive. It takes some time for them to identify the two-dimensional entity that has taken control of them and they're not sure that it's a sentient being. They are at something of a disadvantage as Counselor Troi seems to has lost her own empathic powers. Distraught, she feels she has no choice but to leave the Enterprise. Guinan tries her best to convince her to use her human abilities such as intuition, but has little success. With the clock ticking down, Captain Picard assigns her to work with Commander Data to find a solution to their dilemma.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708805", "rating": 6.0, "votes": 3391, "number_of_episodes": 176}
