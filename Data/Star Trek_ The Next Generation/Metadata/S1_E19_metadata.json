There is debris in the area and the freighter has obviously suffered some damage. On board, they find 3 Klingons with one of them seriously injured. The survivors are not very forthcoming about what happened on their ship nor how three Klingon warriors even ended up on a space freighter. After the injured Klingon dies, the remaining two try to recruit Worf to their cause by appealing to his Klingon heritage and pride. They tell him they were looking for a new world where they could be true Klingons and that the debris the Enterprise found was actually that of a Klingon battle cruiser they fought and destroyed. The Enterprise soon comes into contact with a second Klingon cruiser that wants the renegades arrested and turned over to them.\u2014garykmcd", "The Enterprise stumbles upon a badly damaged Talerian freighter. Entering, Riker's party, using Data's android hazard resistance and Geordie's visor, finds and retrieve the last passengers alive: three stranded Klingon warriors. Worf is delighted with their company, but finds out their story was a cover up and offers the captain to help deal with a Klingon fleet captain who demands their extradition as violent traitors, and who considers the Federation helping the traitors treason to their warlike race.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708726", "rating": 7.2, "votes": 3884, "number_of_episodes": 176}
