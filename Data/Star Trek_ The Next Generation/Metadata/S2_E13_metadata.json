Picard inside.", "Deep in space, the Enterprise comes across a Federation shuttle craft floating aimlessly and without power but exhibiting one human life sign aboard. They tow in the craft only to find it is one of their own, with, to their amazement, a duplicate, but unconscious, Captain Picard inside. Data and La Forge manage to restore power and determine that the craft comes from six hours into the future, with its shuttle log revealing the Enterprise' total destruction. As the Enterprise enters a dangerous vortex, and events in the recovered shuttle's log seem to be coming true, Picard and crew must find a way to break the time-warp cycle they seem to be in.\u2014garykmcd", "Picard faces a crushing dilemma when a shuttle, picked up in space, turns out to be carrying himself from six hours in the future after a fatal explosion aboard the Enterprise, leaving 'him' in a mute trance and responding inversely to medical stimulation. Scientific debate concludes that the ship can't run from the known future. Course is maintained, with the working hypothesis that they bumped into a sort of time-space-loop. Suddenly, an immeasurable and inescapable vortex threatens to swallow the ship. Both Picards disagree over which action is required: logical but proved futile or the seemingly crazy, daring alternative.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise comes upon a disabled Federation shuttle containing one life sign. Bringing it on board they discover it contains an unconscious duplicate Picard. The plot thickens when they discover that the duplicate Picard is from six hours in the future and that he is the only survivor from his Enterprise's destruction.\u2014Michael W Hughes"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708827", "rating": 7.5, "votes": 3975, "number_of_episodes": 176}
