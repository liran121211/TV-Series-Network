He wants Q to keep his part of their earlier bargain and stay away. Q insists that Picard needs him on his side and to prove his point, hurls the Enterprise far into the galaxy. There, the Enterprise crew meet the Borg and their strange, cube-like space craft. The Borg are a race that is part biological and part machine that exists within a collective consciousness. They are also a formidable foe that can out power, out run and out fight the Enterprise. With their shields weakened, it's left to Picard to decide if they really do need Q's help.\u2014garykmcd", "Q has been expelled from his species' continuum and wants to join the Enterprise crew. He appears in a shuttle-craft which he hijacked as a clever way to kidnap and blackmail captain Picard circumventing earlier promises, but is still denied even a fair hearing. So he transports the ship across the galaxy, where they get a taste of the horror fate of star systems invaded by the cybernetic Borg race, known to Guinan, whose people was scattered by them. Picard decides to fight them rather than accept Q's help at the price of admitting he's needed, but is proved wrong as the Borg seem invincible and unwilling to deal with hopelessly inferior races like humans.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708758", "rating": 8.9, "votes": 5449, "number_of_episodes": 176}
