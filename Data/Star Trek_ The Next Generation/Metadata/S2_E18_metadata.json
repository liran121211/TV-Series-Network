Picard suspects the Earthlings in question may have originated with the SS Mariposa, which settled a group of Utopians hundreds of years ago. He is intrigued at the odd mix of equipment they carry. When they arrive and realize that solar flares from the planet's sun will kill them, the Captain orders the colonists removed to the Enterprise for their safety. When the refugees mention another group they originally separated from, the ship travels to the Mariposa colony, made up entirely of clones from their five original survivors. Elsewhere, Worf collapses at his station on the bridge and Dr. Pulaski tries to diagnose what may be wrong with him. He's less than pleased to learn that he has the Klingon version of the measles.\u2014garykmcd", "Checking on a centuries-outdated distress call from an Earth-launched space colonization ship, the Enterprise finds and rescues rustic colonists from a flares-threatened planet - Danilo Odell's primitive agricultural colony set up by an Amish-like anti-progress movement. Learning that the mission was synchronous with a modern scientific one, the ship discovers another colony in a nearby system, one technologically advanced and composed only of clones from five surviving crash-landed colonists, all suffering from replicate deteriorations which must prove fatal in few generations. When Enterprise personnel refuse to donate their DNA, the scientists try in vain to steal it. Picard devises a daring alternative.\u2014KGF Vissers", "An urgent distress signal leads the U.S.S. Enterprise to save a lost colony about to be destroyed by stellar flares. The Bringloidi colony - which consists of over 200 humans and their animals - had rejected modern science to live a pre-industrial Irish life. The entire population transports to the Enterprise, where Piccard learns that the original colony ship also carried a science-oriented group. The other lost colony is located nearby (half a light year away). The Enterprise crew learns that the entire Mariposan society comprises clones made from the five crew members who survived their ship's crash landing. Unfortunately, due to replicative fading, they will soon be unable to clone themselves further and their society will die. Enterprise officers are asked to donate their DNA to clone new citizens - which is refused. The Mariposans then render Riker and Dr . Pulaski unconscious and take the DNA wanted. Upon returning to the U.S.S. Enterprise, Dr. Pulaski discovers that both she and Riker are missing cells, so they beam down and destroy their developing clones. Picard suggests that the two colonies merge and breed naturally. Initially reluctant, both sides agree.\u2014Michael W Hughes"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708838", "rating": 6.2, "votes": 3814, "number_of_episodes": 176}
