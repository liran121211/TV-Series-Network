Also, the Enterprise finds itself having to maneuver through a dangerous nebula.", "When the Enterprise enters the uncharted Mar Oscura dark matter nebula, Data is in charge of scientific observations, together with young Lieutenant Jenna D'Sora, who shows a romantic interest in him. The human crew is clearly unable and/or reluctant to give Data reliable advice, and Troi warns him against trusting in literature on the subject, but since Riker says nothing beats true love Data decides to try 'running' a romantic program with her, yet method is madness in a human lover's eyes. Arriving at an M-class planet's coordinates, the Enterprise finds it inexplicably gone, while Worf fears disappearances and unexplained entries aboard constitute a major security risk. Indeed, the next strikes take victims among machines and crew, but according to Data all can result from proximity of so much dark matter causing gaps of space, which the ship phases in and out of. The plan is to send an observational shuttle ahead, which Picard decides to pilot himself.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise is studying a dark matter nebula, one that is thicker and more dense than anything they have ever encountered. They are curious to learn how such a nebula might have affected the development of life forms. They locate an M-class planet that would be ideal for their study but when they arrive at the coordinates, there is no planet to be found. It all points to a far more dangerous problem. Meanwhile, Lt. Commander Data has become the object of Lt. Jenna D'Sora's affections. She has recently ended a relationship with another crewman but Data isn't quite sure how to react. He seeks advice from several colleagues but few can explain to him the complexities of love and a relationship. He certainly gives it his best effort however.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708735", "rating": 7.1, "votes": 3366, "number_of_episodes": 176}
