The upgrade is in the hands of the Binars, an advanced race whose minds work in binary code. For Picard and the crew it's an opportunity to relax and have a bit of R and R. Commander Riker is never quite sure what to do with himself on these layovers so he decides to spend some time on the holodeck in a New Orleans jazz bar. There he meets the beautiful Minuet and if it's possible to fall in love with a computer image, he practically does so. Picard soon joins them but the holodeck party is oblivious to what is happening on the ship. When the warp containment field begins to fail, Commander Data orders the evacuation of the ship and sends it off into the far reaches of space not realizing Riker and the Captain are still aboard.\u2014garykmcd", "Even observant Wesley can't catch up with the computer system upgrade, which is speedily performed (while the Enterprise is on a short visit to a star base) by two pairs of 'Bynars', a race grown entirely dependent on and evolved to almost merging with their planet's central computer. The rest of the crew enjoys recreation, in Picard and Riker's case in an also upgraded Holodeck-created jazz bar, enchanted by holographic dream woman Minuet. Thus they remain unaware when all the others are evacuated in a false anti-matter out-of-control alarm. The ship sets course for the Bynars planet, but both pairs break down utterly.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708668", "rating": 7.4, "votes": 4408, "number_of_episodes": 176}
