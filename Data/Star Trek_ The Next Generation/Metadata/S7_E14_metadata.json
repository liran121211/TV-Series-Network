Captain Picard accepts governor Maturin's invitation to stay and help repair the storm-damaged power supply. Her best friend, Ned Quint, warns against an heirloom and the ghost of her lover Ronin in general, about whom granny's diary is extraordinarily explicit. Beverly spends sometime in the house she inherits, and has an incredibly intense experience of dream-contact with the lover. Gradually she learns more about her 'inherited' virtual lover. Thus Ned's warning starts to make sense, but only after he got himself killed trying to sabotage the Enterprise power.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708778", "rating": 4.8, "votes": 3521, "number_of_episodes": 176}
