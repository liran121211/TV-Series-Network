Lwaxana tries to match her bachelor daughter with the charming widowed delegation leader Maques, who already knows some English. However the telepathic stress causes her to head for a mental break-down, so Deanna steps in. When Lwaxana falls into a coma without physiological cause, Maques senses it's a 'dark place' in her mind. Deanna tries to connect telepathically, but Mrs. Troi's mind puts up mental defenses, yet the crucial images clearly concern a trauma from their family past, clouded in symbolism.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708695", "rating": 6.4, "votes": 3145, "number_of_episodes": 176}
