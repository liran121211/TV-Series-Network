Okona is a quick-witted and charming rogue who entertains everyone with his humor and is vastly popular with the ladies. While the Enterprise crew rebuilds the parts he needs to continue his journey, they are approached by the leaders of two planets accusing Okona of being a thief, or worse, and demanding that Picard turn him over to them. One is particularly incensed as he has accused Okona of impregnating his daughter. Not all is as it seems however. Data meanwhile tries to better understand humor. He seeks advice from Guinan and on the holodeck also gets advice from a stand up comic.\u2014garykmcd", "The Enterprise takes aboard, while his rackety freight ship is being repaired, rogue shuttle-trader Okona, who quickly seduces several crew members. Soon after arrive ships from the rival planets he trades between, each claiming his extradition for trial. Picard is under no legal obligation and Okuna denies either having stolen Kushell's planet's diamond insignia jewel, reserved for his son Benzan, or impregnating Debin's daughter Yanar, yet offers to leave and let the spaceships chase him. The plan clearly renders the planetary leaders' heirs most uneasy.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708816", "rating": 6.2, "votes": 4067, "number_of_episodes": 176}
