Data learns some of the intricacies of playing poker while Captain Picard runs into an old friend of a sort, Captain Phillipa Louvois, who established a new JAG office at the base. She once prosecuted him, unsuccessfully, but there is admiration at least, on both sides. Problems arise however when Commander Bruce Maddox receives permission to disassemble Data to determine how he functions. When Data expresses doubts about Maddox's likelihood of success, he refuses to undergo the procedure and resigns his commission. He soon finds himself the center of a judicial inquiry to determine if he is just a machine and a piece of property or a sentient being who has the right to make his own decisions. Captain Louvois finds herself sitting in judgment with Captain Picard defending Data's claim against Commander Riker who is forced to present the opposing arguments.\u2014garykmcd", "Commander Bruce Maddox visits the Enterprise, docked at a star base, to claim Data as ultimate test subject for his study of his creator's revolutionary android type, confident it will teach him enough to create many more such superior robots. Data objects, as the intended tests are neither fully safe nor optimally prepared, in theory. Told he must submit under Starfleet orders, Data prefers resigning, but Maddox challenges his right to do so on the grounds of not being a (legal) person. The matter comes to court, presided by Picard's legal nemesis Phillipa Louvois, who commandeers him to defend Data, and Riker to act as prosecutor. For lack of proper legal grounds, both sides discourse rather philosophically on the nature of personality, intelligence and free choice, analyzing Data's own acts, opinions and choices.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708807", "rating": 9.1, "votes": 6702, "number_of_episodes": 176}
