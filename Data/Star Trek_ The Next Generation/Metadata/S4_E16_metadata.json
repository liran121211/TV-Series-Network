Commander Geordi La Forge gets a very special visitor, brilliant engineering designer Dr. Leah Brahms, whom he feels to know almost intimately as a 'hologram version' of herself with 'whom' he bonded; however, the real Brahms proves icy and arrogantly unwilling to consider any of Geordi's empirical findings that could conceivably stand against her theoretically impermeable truth. They take on the challenge to collaborate and learn to know each other better, but when she finds Geordi's hologram version of her, Brahms feels almost pornographically 'abused'. That's one prejudiced insult too many for Geordi. Meanwhile Picard, his bridge officers, and Dr. Crusher have a very different problem, a strange life form which approaches and dies but contains a baby version inside its corpse, which must be separated to stand a chance of survival. When that succeeds, 'junior' instinctively identifies the Enterprise as its mother and locks on, draining energy through the hull, which is only safely sustainable for a few hours. Only after Geordi and Brahms join the bridge does its relevant normal mode of life in an asteroid field become revealed, and the duo come up with an idea.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Geordi La Forge is over the moon to learn that Dr. Leah Brahms, designer of the ship's engines, will be coming aboard to study his engine modifications. He became quite smitten with her during an emergency situation a year ago when the holodeck recreated Brahms to assist with a problem. When she arrives, however, she sees Geordi as a competitor and hasn't take kindly to him having tampered with \"her\" engines. Her frosty demeanor improves over time, but when she realizes Geordi's romantic interest, she has some shocking news for him - then she finds his holodeck program. Meanwhile, the Enterprise has to deal with the outcome of killing an unknown species. The dead creature produces a newborn which imprints itself on the Enterprise, thinking it's its mother. A crisis arises when adults of the same species answer its distress cries.\u2014garykmcd", "At Starbase 313, Dr. Leah Brahms boards the Enterprise to confront Geordi about changes he made to her engine designs. Elated, Geordi feels he knows her intimately from the hologram version of her created a year ago during a crisis (a figure with whom he bonded). The real Brahms, however, proves icy and arrogantly unwilling to consider any of Geordi's empirical findings. Things turn ugly when she discovers her holo-recreation in Geordi's holo-program and feels pornographically abused. Meanwhile, the Enterprise encounters a new, space-dwelling life-form, unaware of it as a pregnant mother nearing birth and unintentionally killing it. Phaser fire frees \"Junior\" from its dead mother, a child which then bonds with the ship (literally), suckling its energy output. The Enterprise heads to an asteroid belt (the surmised destination of the mother) to wean Junior before it sucks them dry, but the child's distress cries attract the attention of several adults.\u2014statmanjeff"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708720", "rating": 7.0, "votes": 3459, "number_of_episodes": 176}
