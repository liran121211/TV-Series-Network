When the holographic hiding place is ravaged by an explosion, the landing party and its advanced technology are observed by two natives, one of whom, Liko, gets hurt badly and is beamed up for life-saving treatment; Picard orders his short-term memory wiped out to prevent a breach of the Prime Directive, but that fails as Commander William Riker and Counselor Deanna Troi find out, after they are beamed down again, temporarily altered to resemble Mintakans, to look for missing anthropologist Palmer. The culture now revives an abandoned belief in a supernatural overseer, worships the Picard, and soon considers offering Counselor Troi as a human sacrifice.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise is en route to the planet Mintaka III where a team of Federation anthropologists are observing the development of the population, a proto-Vulcan society. The Federation team operates from an observation post that is hidden behind a holographic image thereby allowing them to observe freely without interfering with the local culture. Their reactor is in need of urgent repairs however and when it fails, their duck blind is seen by one of the locals, Liko. He must be transported to the ship for emergency medical care but in his quasi-conscious state believes that he has seen the god of his ancestors - in the form of Captain Picard. While the Captain tries to convince Nuria, their leader, that they are simply advanced humanoids and not gods, those remaining on the planet below decide to make a human sacrifice to the god Picard: Counselor Troi.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708844", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 4723, "number_of_episodes": 176}
