Fascinated, Wesley sits with his alien assistant and wins his confidence. The results surpass even Kosinski's wildest dreams, jumping the ship into a galaxy millions of light year away. Deciding against immediate study, Picard orders Kosinski to get them back. Only Wesley notices that his assistant, who 'fades' supernaturally, is the real key. The next jump brings them to where everyone's deepest hopes and fears come true. The alien assistant is ailing and reveals his 'Traveller' identity. Wesley's astuteness is noted and fittingly rewarded with an academy cadet future.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise is ordered to undergo a series of tests that will propel the ship at unfathomable speed, but Riker has misgivings surrounding the equations and theories presented by the arrogant designer, and someone, most unexpected, is the only one who puts his finger on the assistant as the one behind the whole scheme of things.\u2014Moviedude1", "Picard and the Enterprise crew host Mr. Kosinski and his alien assistant (whose name is unpronounceable to humans but who later identifies himself simply as a traveler). Kosinski believes he has developed a method to re-configure the warp drive and vastly increase its speed. Though Riker and others look at his plans and think it's all rubbish, Picard agrees to allow the testing to go forward. On their first attempt to modify the engines, they are successful to the point of sending the Enterprise farther than any Federation vessel has ever traveled (or could hope to travel in their lifetime). Their second attempt strands them in unfamiliar space where thoughts can become reality. The traveler and Wesley Crusher form a close bond, and the question is whether the crew can return to their own space. The traveler also imparts some important information for Picard about young Wesley.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708842", "rating": 7.5, "votes": 4940, "number_of_episodes": 176}
