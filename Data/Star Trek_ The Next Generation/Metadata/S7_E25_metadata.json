Picard finds himself shifting continually into the past, future and present and must use that to discover a threat to humanity's existence.", "Past, present and future collide for Captain Picard as he finds himself bouncing around through three different time periods -- the Farpoint mission, the present, and the future in which many changes have affected the Enterprise-D crew. Meanwhile, the mischievous Q is back for his last time trying to help Picard figure out the meaning of a spatial anomaly - or is he only making things worse? You be the judge on this two-hour TV movie which concludes Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987).\u2014Ian Murray Hamilton <ac743@ccn.cs.dal.ca>", "A bewildered Captain Jean-Luc Picard finds himself moving uncontrollably back and forth through time. One minutes he's aboard the Enterprise, the next, he's twenty five years in the future, working on his vineyard in France. Then suddenly he finds himself seven years in the past, being escorted aboard the Enterprise for the first time. While his crew suspects Picard of suffering from a debilitating mental disease, Picard struggles to convince them to investigate a temporal anomaly in the Neutral Zone that he believes to be related to his problem. Picard soon discovers that Q is responsible for his erratic time travels. Caught in a paradox that Q has devised, Picard realizes he must risk his life and the lives of his crew to save humanity.\u2014Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0111281", "rating": 9.1, "votes": 9573, "number_of_episodes": 176}
