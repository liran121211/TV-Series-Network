When a surface landing goes wrong, the away team is beamed back...with a few extra surprises.", "The end of two centuries of storms on a planet allows the Enterprise to discover the USS Essex, a Federation starship missing for that long, and investigate its system. Riker is the only one of his away team on a moon who, after having been knocked unconscious by another electric storm and touched by an electric phenomenon, remains himself: suddenly Troi, O'Brien and even Data, apparently possessed by aliens, grab their guns on the bridge and take five hostages, including Keiko and her baby, demanding that the ship steer to the southern pole, where the Essex is. Picard has himself exchanged for the five and Dr. Crusher figures out the away team was probably affected by an ionic phenomenon, which didn't affect Riker because of his wound-caused pain, which inspires Geordi to prepare a man a pain-gun.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise has received a distress call from an M-class moon that was previously believed to be uninhabitable. Data determines that that the signal is an old sub-space type used by Federation starships nearly 200 years ago. It comes from the USS Essex which disappeared in this sector space around that time. Data, Troi and Riker travel to the planet's surface by shuttle craft and when they rig an enhancer to beam back aboard the ship Data, O'Brien and Troi try to commandeer the ship. They're unsuccessful in taking over the bridge but take several prisoners in Ten Forward. They claim to be essence of the Essex command crew but something far more sinister is at work.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708756", "rating": 7.3, "votes": 3284, "number_of_episodes": 176}
