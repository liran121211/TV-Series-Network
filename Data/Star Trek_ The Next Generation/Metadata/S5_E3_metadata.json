Admiral Kennelly decides the Enterprise's mission to settle that dispute peacefully requires a Bajoran officer and therefore assigns, without consulting Picard, female Ensign Ro Laren, whom he had to release from jail first, to the whole crew's dismay. After receiving blankets, the Bajoran refugee camp leader Keeve Falor arranges a meeting with Orta. There Picard finds former refugee Ro Laren came with a secret Bajorian agenda herself, but she tells him it's not just hers, the admiral is behind it. Then two Cardassian ships appear and their commander Gul Dolak demands the Enterprise deliver to them the ship of the Bajorans which the Enterprise is resettling as terrorists; Picard deals with the dark plot.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Picard and the Enterprise finds themselves in the middle of a possible war between the Cardassians and the Bajorans. The Cardassians and the Federation have recently signed a peace treaty and as far as the Cardassians consider the Bajorans are terrorists who have recently attacked one of their colonies. Picard very much doubts that the Bajorans have the capability of attacking and so sets out to prove it. The Enterprise has also taken on a new officer Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran, who has something of a reputation for being insubordinate. As Picard will soon learn, she also been sent aboard the Enterprise with very specific orders.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708708", "rating": 7.8, "votes": 3670, "number_of_episodes": 176}
