They broke away almost 100 years ago and and are now known as the Gatherers, a band of scavengers forever raiding and scavenging anything they can get their hands on. Marouk is prepared to offer them an amnesty but there is a great deal of mistrust between them. Commander Riker meanwhile takes an interest in Marouk's cook Yuta, but the attention of the crew is diverted to finding a saboteur when one of the Gatherers is killed.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708824", "rating": 6.5, "votes": 3480, "number_of_episodes": 176}
