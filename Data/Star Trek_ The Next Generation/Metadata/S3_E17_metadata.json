Riker is charged with hosting Klingon commander Kurn, who takes his place as first officer as part of an exchange program. As expected, his ruthlessly authoritative command style gets on everyone's nerve, but the worst is yet to come: Kurn reveals himself as Lieutenant Worf's younger brother, and demands he joins him in dealing with a blood feud, as their late father's honor is challenged by accusations of treason to the Empire in league with the Romulans during a bloody attack. The Enterprise sets course to the Klingon first city, while Picard fears legal and diplomatic repercussions. Data finds indications the Klingon records were doctored, possibly at Klingon High Council level, so the Enterprise crew sets out to find out the truth...\u2014KGF Vissers", "As part of an ongoing exchange program with the Klingon Empire, Commander Kurn comes aboard to serve as the Enterprise's executive officer. Kurn is well versed in Federation protocols and is qualified for the position in all respects except perhaps one: the way in which he treats subordinates. He demands complete and unquestioning loyalty from everyone around him. Kurn had specifically requested assignment to the Enterprise and with good reason: he is actually Worf's younger brother who, unknown to Worf himself, survived the attack that killed their parents. He's come to Worf with news that their father has been declared a traitor and that as the older brother, he wants Worf to lead the challenge. They return to the Klingon homeworld accompanied by Captain Jean-Luc Picard intent on clearing the family name.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708775", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 4061, "number_of_episodes": 176}
