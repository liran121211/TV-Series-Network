After four of her medical staff members disappear similarly, Wesley thinks up an experimental warp bubble-effect theory, but Data points out she has no staff and is wrong about the staff size by over 800. Next she barely escapes a vortex, but no sensor recording or anomaly concurs with its existence; Deanna refuses to answer if she's going mad. When Wesley tells her the only one who must know more about warp bubbles is a strange alien, the Traveler, who combined it with mind power to create an alternate reality, Beverly believes somehow that technique must have been recreated during the experiment.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Dr. Crusher welcomes her old friend and mentor Dr. Dalen Quaice aboard the Enterprise. When he fails to join her for breakfast as planned she goes to his quarters to find them vacant. The ship's computer says it cannot locate Dr. Quaice anywhere on board. In fact, the database says that such a person has never existed. A search of the ship reveals nothing until Crusher begins to realize that other members of the Enterprise crew are disappearing as well. When she is very nearly sucked into a vortex of some some sort, she believes she's found out just what is happening to the crew. It's actually far more complex however.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708765", "rating": 7.8, "votes": 4133, "number_of_episodes": 176}
