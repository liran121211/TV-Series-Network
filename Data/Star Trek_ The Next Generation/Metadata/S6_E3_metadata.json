Alkar asks for another freighter to avoid a military appearance but Admiral Simons agrees security requires that Picard remain his host. Alkar arrives with his 93-year old mother, a witch whose aggression and warnings not to have close contact with Ves are rather scary, as her hateful thoughts are to Troi, but soon she is found dead in his quarters. Dr. Crusher doubts a natural cause of death, but without danger to the ship, Picard must respect the ambassador's objection against an autopsy on traditional grounds. Troi agrees to take part in a ceremony requiring empathy, after which she turns much more emotional, irritated and seductive, even scratching her lover Riker. Troi is also aging rapidly, so now Picard allows an autopsy, which proves the late Sev Maylor is no genetic relative of Alkar, who admits the joining drains the receptacle's life energy so he can do his diplomatic work for peace without his emotions burdening him.\u2014KGF Vissers", "The Enterprise rescues Ambassador Ves Alkar whose transport ship is attacked while en route to sensitive negotiations between warring factions. He's accompanied by his elderly mother who on arrival warns Troi to stay away from him. Troi is frightened by the old woman who soon succumbs to some unknown fate and dies. Ves Alkar admits she was quite ill and now regrets having invited her to accompany him. Dr. Crusher can find no clear cause of death but the ambassador refuses her permission to conduct an autopsy. After Deanna Troi undergoes a severe personality change and rapid aging, it points to Alkar deliberately using Deanna for his own purposes. With Alkar showing no remorse for his actions, Picard and Dr. Crusher devise a means to rescue Troi from an untimely death.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0708746", "rating": 5.7, "votes": 3093, "number_of_episodes": 176}
