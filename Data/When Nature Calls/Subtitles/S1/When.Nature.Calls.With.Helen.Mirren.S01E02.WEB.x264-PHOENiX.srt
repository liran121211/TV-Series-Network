Then take it from our locals,
like this fella.

869
00:42:01,749 --> 00:42:04,334
If you enjoy nightlife,
this place is great for you

870
00:42:04,334 --> 00:42:06,628
because nights are all we get.

871
00:42:06,628 --> 00:42:09,757
Seriously, I haven't seen
the sun in eight weeks.

872
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:11,884
Narrator:
And also, this fella.

873
00:42:11,884 --> 00:42:14,678
Come for a little R&R,
leave with a cool accent.

874
00:42:14,678 --> 00:42:16,346
#sweg.

875
00:42:16,346 --> 00:42:18,182
Narrator:
So this travel season,

876
00:42:18,182 --> 00:42:19,892
do something different
for Pete's sake,

877
00:42:19,892 --> 00:42:23,187
and head to Way Friggin'
Up North There Now, okay?

878
00:42:23,187 --> 00:42:25,230
We could really use the company.

879
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:29,193
We're lonely.
