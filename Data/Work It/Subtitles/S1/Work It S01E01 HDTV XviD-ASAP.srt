1
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:05,588
Hey.
Hey.

2
00:00:05,655 --> 00:00:06,689
Honey, how did it go?

3
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,691
Well, the company
actually folded

4
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,693
while I was in the interview.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,861
Oh.

6
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:13,596
But...

7
00:00:13,663 --> 00:00:14,664
(Chuckles)

8
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:16,699
You stole all their sugar.

9
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,668
Yeah. That's not all.
Mm-hmm.

10
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:20,003
And look, salt and pepper...

11
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:22,005
Ooh, hoo.
We got creamer, and... wait for it.

12
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:23,673
Mm-hmm.
Wait for it.

13
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,741
Uh-huh.

14
00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:26,042
Ketchup.

15
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,577
Ooh, hoo!

16
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:28,912
Well, it'll all come in handy

17
00:00:28,978 --> 00:00:31,581
'cause you got your last
unemployment check today.

18
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:33,716
Oh, yeah. I can't believe
it's already been a year.

19
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:34,951
I can't either.
But don't worry about it.

20
00:00:35,018 --> 00:00:37,620
As you can see, our lifestyle
doesn't have to suffer.

21
00:00:37,687 --> 00:00:39,923
(Laughs)

22
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,992
Oh, hey, your insurance from
Pontiac is about to run out,

23
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:45,662
so I made an appointment for you
to get a physical tomorrow.

24
00:00:45,728 --> 00:00:46,930
No, sweetheart, I told you...
Oh, no, hey.

25
00:00:46,996 --> 00:00:48,998
Lee, as a woman,
I'm gonna have to ask you

26
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:50,700
to stop comparing
a prostate exam

27
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:52,635
to the pinball scene
in "The Accused."

28
00:00:52,702 --> 00:00:55,038
No, it's not okay.

29
00:00:55,104 --> 00:00:56,706
Hey, dad.
Hey.

30
00:00:56,773 --> 00:00:58,608
My phone's not working.

31
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:01,845
Oh. Huh.
Well, let me take a look.

32
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:03,847
Oh, yeah.
Just as I suspected.

33
00:01:03,913 --> 00:01:05,648
I cancelled your service.

34
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:07,584
What?
I'm sorry, Kat.

35
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,820
Would a packet of soy sauce
make you feel better?

36
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:13,923
Look, it's just until
I find a job. Okay?

37
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,992
But what am I gonna do
in the meantime?

38
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:17,660
Sweetie, we have a landline.

39
00:01:17,727 --> 00:01:20,630
A landline? Don't those
give you brain cancer?

40
00:01:20,697 --> 00:01:22,599
You know what?

41
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:26,870
I'm just gonna have to find
myself a rich, older boyfriend.

42
00:01:26,936 --> 00:01:28,872
You and me both.
You and me both.

43
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:34,043
Check it out.
We're in the paper.

44
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,612
Really?
Yeah.

45
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,614
"St. Louis unemployment
hits record high."

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,016
Mm. Ah, they couldn't have
done it without us.

47
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,584
Hey, don't worry about it.

48
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:43,586
I'm gonna figure something out,
all right.

49
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:45,822
You know the deal.
If I'm working, you're working.

50
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:47,924
Right back at ya, bro.
Mm-hmm.

51
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:49,926
What's up, guys?

52
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:51,594
Hey, Brian.
Hey, B.

53
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:52,695
Did you get your last check?

54
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:54,697
Yep. Hard to believe.

55
00:01:54,764 --> 00:01:56,699
A year ago,
we were sittin' pretty.

56
00:01:56,766 --> 00:02:00,570
St. Louis Pontiac's
top salesman, head mechanic,

57
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:04,574
and nearly accident-free
courtesy shuttle driver.

58
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:05,608
(Chuckles)

59
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:07,777
Now look at us.
How did this happen?

60
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:08,978
Well, it's a recession.

61
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,781
It's not a recession.
It's a mancession.

62
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:14,584
Look, women are taking over
the workforce.

63
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:16,653
Soon, they'll start
getting rid of men.

64
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,758
They'll just keep a few of us
around as sex slaves.

65
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:23,927
That part doesn't sound so bad.

66
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:26,029
Not the kind of sex you like,
Angel.

67
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:28,965
Just kissing
and cuddling and...

68
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:30,934
Listening.

69
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,804
Well, I'll tell you what. I'm
not going down without a fight.

70
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:37,006
I did hear they're hiring
down at, uh, Astro Taco.

71
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:40,977
No! That place is a dump.
I mean, we still have our pride.

72
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:43,046
(Laughs) For now.

73
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:45,915
When the women take over,
they'll make pride illegal.

74
00:02:45,982 --> 00:02:48,718
That and eating on the toilet.

75
00:02:51,654 --> 00:02:52,755
Ah, thanks, doc.

76
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:54,958
That prostate exam wasn't
as bad as I expected.

77
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:56,893
Beers really took the edge off.

78
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,864
I love your bracelet.

79
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,832
It was a little present
to myself.

80
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:04,701
I could wait around
for a guy to buy it for me,

81
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,669
but none of them have
any money.

82
00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:09,839
Oh. So the drug business
is good, uh?

83
00:03:09,906 --> 00:03:12,609
Bazonkers. I have got more work
than I can handle.

84
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:15,745
In fact, if you know anyone,
we are looking to hire.

85
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:17,847
Uh, really?
'Cause I'm a salesman

86
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:19,849
and I-I happen to be
between jobs.

87
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,719
Oh, we're kind of just
looking for girls.

88
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,753
Really? Why?

89
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,921
Well, we've had some guys,

90
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:28,591
but the doctors seem to want
to nail them less.

91
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:30,693
Okay, see ya next time.

92
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,794
(Chuckles)

93
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,763
Um, Mr. Standish?
Yeah?

94
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,964
How would you like
to pay for your physical?

95
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:36,866
What do you mean? I showed you
my insurance card on the way in.

96
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:38,835
But your coverage lapsed
last week.

97
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:40,570
What?!

98
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,572
The total is $900.

99
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,940
Oh, my God.

100
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:51,114
How the hell
am I gonna get $900?

101
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:08,832
Oh, I'm sorry, Connie.

102
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:33,656
(Telephone ringing)

103
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:42,966
Lee Standish?

104
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,868
Yes?
We're ready for you.

105
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:46,769
Oh, well, wish me luck.

106
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:49,005
Thanks for the tampon.

109
00:05:05,383 --> 00:05:07,375
Hi. I'm Vanessa Warner.

110
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:10,177
I run the midwest drug sales
division here at Coreco.

111
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:12,064
Oh. Lee Standish.

112
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:13,999
Um...

113
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,025
(Chuckles)

114
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:23,774
So I got a chance
to look at your resume.

115
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:24,910
And I have to say,
I'm intrigued.

116
00:05:24,977 --> 00:05:27,012
Mm.
You sold Pontiacs?

117
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,430
Oh, yes, yes.

118
00:05:28,488 --> 00:05:31,055
Believe it or not,
that it my actual resume.

119
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:33,085
What was it like working there?

120
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:34,853
There couldn't have been
many women.

121
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,088
No, I was the only one.

122
00:05:36,154 --> 00:05:37,723
Mm. That must've been hard.

123
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:38,924
Oh, it was!

124
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:42,928
The guys were always sassing me
or patting my Fanny

125
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:44,119
or...

126
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:47,023
Ogling my... my teats.

127
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:52,871
Well, you are a very...

128
00:05:52,938 --> 00:05:54,673
Beautiful woman.

129
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,008
Oh.

130
00:05:56,074 --> 00:05:58,677
And you played...
Football in college?

131
00:05:58,744 --> 00:06:00,145
Oh!

132
00:06:02,814 --> 00:06:05,684
Is that still on there?

133
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:08,020
Yes. I-I played
lingerie football.

134
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:10,689
(Chuckles) But anyway,

135
00:06:10,756 --> 00:06:12,057
what I really wanna talk about

136
00:06:12,124 --> 00:06:13,792
are some of
the amazing pharmaceuticals

137
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:14,893
that Coreco makes.

138
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,663
For instance, your new
arthritis drug Polluxor?

139
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:19,765
The results it's been getting
in nonpartisan clinical trials

140
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:21,933
are just stunning.

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,869
And the fact that it has
all the advantages

142
00:06:23,935 --> 00:06:26,805
of low dose corticosteroids
without any of the side effects

143
00:06:26,872 --> 00:06:28,106
of the Cox-2 selective nsaids?

144
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:31,810
(Chuckles)
I mean, get out of town!

145
00:06:31,877 --> 00:06:33,712
You're impressive.
Mm.

146
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:34,880
Most of the girls
who interview here

147
00:06:34,946 --> 00:06:36,048
think clinical trials

148
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:38,917
are the things Lindsay Lohan
keeps having to go to.

149
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:41,981
I'm not your ordinary girl.

150
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:45,873
No, you're not.

151
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:48,927
Honey.

152
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:50,662
Hi.

153
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:51,930
I got a job!

154
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:54,066
Are... are... are you serious?
Doing what?

155
00:06:54,132 --> 00:06:55,968
Uh, working as a salesman
at drug company.

156
00:06:56,034 --> 00:06:57,803
You know, talking
in my regular voice,

157
00:06:57,869 --> 00:06:59,104
my genitals just hanging free.

158
00:06:59,171 --> 00:07:01,006
Oh, honey! Yay!
(Laughs)

159
00:07:01,073 --> 00:07:02,774
Oh! I don't wanna say
that I'd given up hope,

160
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:03,976
but, yeah, I kinda had.

161
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,711
Yeah, well, me, too.
Yeah.

162
00:07:05,777 --> 00:07:07,779
My brave face
was getting so tired.

163
00:07:07,846 --> 00:07:09,469
But we did it.
We did it.

164
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:10,546
We made it through.

165
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:12,050
Mwah!
(Laughs)

166
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:13,752
Come on, I'm taking you out.
Let's celebrate.

167
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:15,020
Okay. Let me just
go get changed.

168
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:17,789
No, what you have on is fine.
We're just going to the bar.

169
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:19,758
The bar?
Yeah, yeah.

170
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:22,027
I called Angel and Brian.
We're gonna m... ah, Angel and Brian.

171
00:07:23,195 --> 00:07:25,931
You know what? I suddenly
do not feel like going out.

172
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:27,666
Okay. (Kisses)

173
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:29,768
I'll just wake you up
for sex later. Yeah?

174
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:35,707
Okay, wait. You seem mad.
What...

175
00:07:35,774 --> 00:07:36,808
What is it?

176
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,677
Why don't you give it
some thought?

177
00:07:38,744 --> 00:07:40,846
And just see
what you come up with. Okay?

178
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,885
Oh, sorry, ladies!

179
00:07:46,952 --> 00:07:48,920
A man got a job.

180
00:07:48,987 --> 00:07:50,088
(Chuckles)

181
00:07:50,155 --> 00:07:51,723
Guess you'll have to wait
a little while longer

182
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,026
for your sex slaves.
(Laughs)

183
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:57,729
So... when can we come by
the office

184
00:07:57,796 --> 00:07:58,997
so you can take us out
to lunch?

185
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:00,999
Mm. Mm.

186
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:02,801
Um...

187
00:08:02,868 --> 00:08:04,703
Well, you know, I, um...

188
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,937
I don't get a lunch break.

189
00:08:06,004 --> 00:08:09,908
Well, then how about getting us
some job interviews?

190
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:12,678
Uh... come on, Brian.
The man just got hired.

191
00:08:12,744 --> 00:08:14,846
Now he's supposed to
put his ass on the line for you?

192
00:08:14,913 --> 00:08:16,081
I'm sorry.

193
00:08:16,148 --> 00:08:19,851
It's just getting a little
awkward living with my ex-wife.

194
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,088
The new husband?
Not a big fan.

195
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:26,058
(Clears throat)

196
00:08:26,124 --> 00:08:27,659
Thanks for getting him
off my back.

197
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:29,962
No problem. But we still
have our deal, right?

198
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:31,930
If you're working, I'm working.

199
00:08:31,997 --> 00:08:34,099
Well, um...

200
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:38,103
I'm not sure you'd be up
for everything...

201
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,939
This job requires.

202
00:08:41,006 --> 00:08:43,141
But I'm Puerto Rican.
I'd be great at selling drugs.

203
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,078
Ah.
That's not what I mean.

204
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:47,879
Then what do you mean?

205
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:50,778
Just that, um...

206
00:08:50,882 --> 00:08:53,685
I don't think
you'd totally fit in.

207
00:08:53,752 --> 00:08:55,921
Oh, I get it. It's because
I'm a mechanic, right?

208
00:08:55,988 --> 00:08:58,090
No. I'm not good enough to
work in your fancy office?

209
00:08:58,156 --> 00:08:59,891
No, that's not what I meant, Angel.
I... no, no.

210
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:00,993
It's good.

211
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:02,928
I'm glad to know
what you really think of me.

212
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:06,064
Come on, man.
Enjoy your stupid celebration.

213
00:09:12,215 --> 00:09:13,772
Ahem.

214
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,140
Uh, pardon me.

215
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:16,336
Mm-hmm?

216
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,844
Oh!
Hi, I'm... I'm Lee.

217
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,880
I just finished my orientation.
I wasn't sure where my desk is.

218
00:09:21,947 --> 00:09:23,465
Welcome! I'm Kelly.

219
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:25,938
Oh, hi.
This is your desk right here.

220
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:28,242
And... wait.
Have we met before?

221
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:29,699
Oh, I don't think so.

222
00:09:29,718 --> 00:09:31,687
I've never been
to that doctor's office.

223
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:40,032
You must be
the giant car saleswoman.

224
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,702
Vanessa told me about you.

225
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:45,704
Yes, hi. I'm... I'm...
Lee Standish. Yes, I know.

226
00:09:45,771 --> 00:09:47,005
I'm Grace Hudson.

227
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:48,774
I've been
the regional sales leader

228
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,008
for the last couple of years.

229
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:51,843
But from what Vanessa tells me,

230
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,079
it looks like I might have
some competition.

231
00:09:54,146 --> 00:09:55,714
Oh, I don't know about that.

232
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:58,884
Yeah, I don't know about that
either.

233
00:09:59,985 --> 00:10:01,119
Cute bag.

234
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:02,955
Oh, thank you!

235
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:04,923
Come on, grace.
Don't be such a bitch.

236
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,959
What? I-I said I liked it.

237
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:08,126
We know what you meant.

238
00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:10,762
We do?

239
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:13,765
Oh! You must be
the new girl!

240
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:14,833
I'm Kristin.

241
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,703
I used to be the new girl,
but not anymore!

242
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:19,938
Please tell me you're not
already in a book club.

243
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:21,006
(Mouths word)

244
00:10:21,073 --> 00:10:23,041
So what's your story?
Are you married?

245
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:24,843
Wait, wait.
I'm really good at this.

246
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,678
Um, so no wedding ring,

247
00:10:26,745 --> 00:10:29,147
but I do see a tan line
on your ring finger.

248
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:30,682
Mm.
So...

249
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:31,717
Divorced.

250
00:10:31,783 --> 00:10:34,152
Did he leave you
for someone smaller?

251
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:42,794
Wow, you guys just
dive right in, don't you?

252
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:44,997
You're right.
We're so rude to pry.

253
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:46,665
Was it messy?

254
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:49,101
Any traumatized kids at home?

255
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:50,936
Well, I suppose
there's no harm in telling you

256
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:52,771
I-I do have
a 14-year-old daughter.

257
00:10:52,838 --> 00:10:54,106
Oh, my God!

258
00:10:54,172 --> 00:10:57,042
I'm a single mom, too.

259
00:10:57,109 --> 00:10:58,810
Ethan is 8.

260
00:10:58,877 --> 00:11:00,912
He's always the only one
at "bring your kid to work" day,

261
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:03,682
but now your daughter
will be there, too!

262
00:11:03,749 --> 00:11:05,083
Oh, she can't.
She's, um...

263
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,533
She's in a bubble.

264
00:11:09,821 --> 00:11:11,757
(Cell phone rings)
Oh, that's me.

265
00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:13,792
(Ring)

266
00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:15,827
Ooh, I should take this.
It's my, uh, my...

267
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:18,017
Waxer. (Chuckles)
(Ring)

268
00:11:20,308 --> 00:11:21,800
(Normal voice) Hello?
Hey, Lee,

269
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:22,834
I don't like the way
we left things.

270
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:24,770
We need to have a conversation.

271
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:25,871
Sweetheart,
now's not a good time, okay?

272
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:27,105
Me and the guys at work...

273
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:29,053
Hey, sweetie, we're gonna get
some lunch. Wanna join us?

274
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:30,295
Who's that woman?

275
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,843
(Feminine voice)
I'll be right there.

276
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,078
And who's that woman?

277
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:34,859
(Normal voice) It's no one.
I've gotta go.

278
00:11:35,317 --> 00:11:37,185
(Beep)
(Groans)

279
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:38,879
Oh, come on Lee.
Have a seat.

280
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,175
Okay. Let me get my...

281
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:43,934
I am just so...

282
00:11:44,032 --> 00:11:45,100
Hungry.

283
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,512
Oh. Mm.

284
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,002
All right. So...

285
00:11:57,069 --> 00:11:58,170
There we go.

286
00:12:01,907 --> 00:12:04,176
Bon appetit. (Chuckles)

287
00:12:05,911 --> 00:12:07,145
Mmm!

288
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:15,787
Uh, excuse me?

289
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:18,890
Welcome to Astro Taco.
Arriba, arriba.

290
00:12:18,957 --> 00:12:20,859
Can I help you?

291
00:12:20,926 --> 00:12:22,094
Uh, yes.

292
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,664
Um, uh, one...
One steak burrito, please.

293
00:12:25,731 --> 00:12:26,832
One steak.

294
00:12:26,898 --> 00:12:27,933

295
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,935

$5.75.

296
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:31,003
Okay.

297
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:32,938
(Whirring)

298
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:36,141
Ole, ole. Have a nice day.

299
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,876
Oh, you, too.

300
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:47,354
(Normal voice)
Ah, screw it.

301
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,460
(Feminine voice)
Uh, pardon me?

302
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:50,856
I have a bone to pick with you.

303
00:12:50,922 --> 00:12:53,859
You gave me change for a $10,
and I gave you a $300.

304
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:55,761
Lady, you're crazy.
Get out of here.

305
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:58,374
Okay. But just one more thing
I have to say.

306
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:01,491
(Normal voice) It's me.

307
00:13:02,604 --> 00:13:03,538
Lee.

308
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,957
Lee?
Yeah.

309
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,360
This is what I had to do
to get a job.

310
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:08,803
Okay, my eyes are up here.

311
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:14,023
That's how I got the job,

312
00:13:14,575 --> 00:13:16,443
and I wanna help you
get one, too.

313
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:18,600
How did you even do this?

314
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:20,270
You really wanna know?

I don't know, man.

You have to understand,
this kind of thing

344

doesn't really fly
in my culture.

(Feminine voice) Hi.
I'm here for my interview.

364
00:15:02,906 --> 00:15:04,241
Hi. I'm Vanessa.

365
00:15:04,308 --> 00:15:06,943
Likewise.

366
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,946
I mean, Angel Ortiz.

367
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:11,982
It's nice to meet you.
I love your scarf.

368
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:13,150
Oh, thank you.

369
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:15,252
And your ass looks tight
in those pants.

370
00:15:22,326 --> 00:15:23,894
Hey!

371
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,862
How you doing?
Oh, pretty good.

372
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,898
Little itchy.

373
00:15:27,964 --> 00:15:30,100
I hope grace isn't being
too rough on you.

374
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:31,268
She gave me a hard time

375
00:15:31,335 --> 00:15:33,036
when I first started
working here, too,

376
00:15:33,103 --> 00:15:35,839
and now
we're such good friends.

377
00:15:35,906 --> 00:15:36,907
We even have nicknames
for each other.

378
00:15:36,974 --> 00:15:40,143
Like, I call her "hottie"
or princess,"

379
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,246
and she calls me
"sausage fingers."

380
00:15:47,017 --> 00:15:49,853
Anyway, I got you something.

381
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,054
Oh! Wow!

382
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:52,189
Thank you. (Gasps)

383
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:54,891
Thank you so much!
(Chuckles)

384
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,059
But can I ask you something?

385
00:15:56,126 --> 00:15:57,894
What... what's so bad
about my pocketbook?

386
00:15:57,961 --> 00:16:00,097
Besides the fact that
you call it a pocketbook?

387
00:16:00,163 --> 00:16:03,266
Look, uh, don't take this
the wrong way,

388
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:08,138
but it seems like you haven't
been shopping in this century.

389
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:09,206
Oh.

390
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:10,273
Really?

391
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,009
Look, I-I know
what it's like

392
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:16,113
having to work and take care
of a kid all by yourself.

393
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:18,248
Not that it was any easier
when I was married.

394
00:16:18,315 --> 00:16:20,050
My husband was no help.

395
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:22,986
He was always just hanging out
at the bar with his friends.

396
00:16:23,053 --> 00:16:25,155
Was yours like that?

397
00:16:25,222 --> 00:16:28,025
Well, maybe a little.

398
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:30,260
But, you know, he would
invite me along to the bar.

399
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:33,063
Oh, ooh! What a prince!
(Chuckles)

400
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:36,233
Anyway, the bag is
just a reminder

401
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:38,068
that you're a woman.

402
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:41,238
And you have needs.
You can't neglect yourself.

403
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:43,140
Well, maybe you're right.

404
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:46,910
Maybe I have been
neglecting... myself

405
00:16:46,977 --> 00:16:48,312
well, stop it!
Oh!

406
00:16:48,378 --> 00:16:51,114
Oh! Oh! Oh.

407
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:53,016
And inside the bag

408
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,152
is the next selection
for book club.

409
00:16:55,218 --> 00:16:57,154
It's about a girl
who comes of age

410
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,856
during a spelling bee
in Rwanda.

411
00:16:59,923 --> 00:17:00,957
Oh.

412
00:17:01,024 --> 00:17:04,928
Spoiler alert... she dies.

413
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:08,198
Lee! Lee!

414
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:10,100
Oh. Um, pardon me
for just one moment.

415
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,201
Mm-hmm.

416
00:17:11,268 --> 00:17:12,970
Thank you. (Chuckles)

417
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:14,137
(Normal voice) How'd it go?
(Normal voice) I blew it.

418
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:15,839
Why didn't you tell me
she was so hot?

419
00:17:15,906 --> 00:17:18,008
My ace bandage was holding on
for dear life.

420
00:17:24,014 --> 00:17:25,849
You... you want me to talk to her?
I'll talk...

421
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,017
No, no, no. She already left
for a meeting.

422
00:17:27,084 --> 00:17:29,052
And I don't want you risking
your job for me.

423
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,021
I'm sure Astro Taco
will take me back.

424
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:32,122
Oh, man.

425
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:34,024
Jessica,
will you call Dr. Lerner

426
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:35,959
and tell him I'm gonna be late?

427
00:17:36,026 --> 00:17:37,894
My car won't start.

428
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:39,062
(Keys clatter)

429
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:40,964

430
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:46,937

a little bit about cars.

435

So you fixed Vanessa's car?

436
00:17:55,145 --> 00:17:56,980
Mm-hmm, and once I got it
running, she was like,

437
00:17:57,047 --> 00:17:59,149
"anyone who would
get under a car in a skirt

438
00:17:59,216 --> 00:18:02,052
is worth taking a chance on."

439
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,887
How did you know how
to do that?

440
00:18:03,954 --> 00:18:05,055
Oh, it was easy.

441
00:18:05,122 --> 00:18:06,627
I just had to tune the solenoid

442
00:18:06,757 --> 00:18:09,057
so the drive gear meshed
with the flywheel.

443

00:18:14,097 --> 00:18:15,232
What is Vanessa like as a boss?

445
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:18,201
Is she just all about the job
or does she have a husband?

446
00:18:18,268 --> 00:18:19,236
No, no husband.

447
00:18:19,303 --> 00:18:20,619
Really?

448
00:18:20,705 --> 00:18:23,986
Yeah, and personally, I think
she might be a lesbian.

449
00:18:24,141 --> 00:18:25,976

I lost sight of the fact

that I'm not the only one
this past year's been tough on.

500

And I am sorry
if I've been neglecting you.

You figured it out.

503

can I just cut to the chase?
