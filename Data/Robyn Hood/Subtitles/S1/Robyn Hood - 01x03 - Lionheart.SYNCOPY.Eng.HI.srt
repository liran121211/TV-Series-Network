finish donating the rest

You know, I have to say,

361
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:34,180
I was very surprised
to see you back here,

362
00:19:34,222 --> 00:19:36,584
after all those memories.

363
00:19:36,952 --> 00:19:39,112
You could have turned me in,

364
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:41,261
but you didn't.

365
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:43,953
Your dumb ass caught a charge anyway.

366
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:47,027
Yeah, you were right.

367
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,019
But I think there's more to it.

368
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,836
I think... you are ashamed of the truth.

369
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,665
- Come on.
- You're making a mistake, Guy.

370
00:19:59,016 --> 00:20:00,736
These are good people,
they'll fight you.

371
00:20:00,747 --> 00:20:05,711
(LAUGHING)

372
00:20:07,115 --> 00:20:09,592
Like The Hood fought off The Sheriff?

373
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:12,498
Come on, huh? You know
what? You know what?

374
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:15,552
I gotta say, I like their style.

375
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:20,355
The masks? They're cute. They're cute.

376
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:22,793
Maybe I'll add them to my wardrobe,

377
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:25,219
once I wash out the blood.

378
00:20:27,902 --> 00:20:30,822
(CHUCKLING)

379
00:20:30,878 --> 00:20:33,399
Man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh...

380
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,330
Are you a reader, Little John?

381
00:20:35,554 --> 00:20:39,317
'Cause I practically lived
in the prison library,

382
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:41,155
feeding my mind.

383
00:20:41,303 --> 00:20:44,463
Nature books were my favourite 'cause,

384
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,932
at the end of the
day, we're all animals.

385
00:20:47,974 --> 00:20:50,974
- Hey! Hey!
- (SHUSHING)

386
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:53,945
That's right. (CHUCKLING)

387
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:55,653
Do you know what happens

388
00:20:55,664 --> 00:20:59,903
when there's no more
wolves in the forest?

389
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:02,755
The grazers take over. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

390
00:21:03,035 --> 00:21:06,327
They eat too much, they grow too fat,

391
00:21:07,063 --> 00:21:10,623
the forest withers.

392
00:21:10,665 --> 00:21:15,586
But you bring back the
lobos, control the grazers,

393
00:21:15,628 --> 00:21:17,991
and the world is balanced again.

394
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:22,326
The forest blooms.

395
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:25,805
These people...

396
00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:28,501
they need a strong hand.

397
00:21:28,512 --> 00:21:30,875
They need lobos, like us.

398
00:21:32,476 --> 00:21:36,798
Come on. Come on. Come to Gisbourne.

399
00:21:37,273 --> 00:21:41,273
Let me teach you what
Lionheart couldn't.

400
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:46,750
Or just stay here,

401
00:21:47,694 --> 00:21:50,970
and hope every single day

402
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:54,025
they don't find out who you really are.

403
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:57,452
(LAUGHING)

404
00:22:08,418 --> 00:22:12,367
So? Do you believe in miracles?
Because your boy's out there,

405
00:22:12,378 --> 00:22:14,901
turning water into wine, baby!

406
00:22:14,912 --> 00:22:17,351
- So, you got the part?
- First, I had to track down

407
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:19,051
my mechanical connect Omar.

408
00:22:19,062 --> 00:22:21,020
And let me tell ya, when he
does not want to be found,

409
00:22:21,062 --> 00:22:22,943
he is not found.

410
00:22:22,985 --> 00:22:24,502
So, I had to go all the way across town

411
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:26,345
to find his girl
Tayesha. Come to find out,

412
00:22:26,356 --> 00:22:27,939
she ain't his girl no more.

413
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,860
She's not even trynna hear
his name come out my mouth...

414
00:22:29,871 --> 00:22:31,207
- (CLEARING THROAT) Alan.
- 'Cause they got a whole...

415
00:22:31,218 --> 00:22:34,339
Right. So, then, I go see Gimme Gary.

416
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,994
- Gimme Gary?
- 'Cause you always gotta give his ass something.

417
00:22:37,005 --> 00:22:38,904
- Doesn't believe in favours.
- Right.

418
00:22:38,915 --> 00:22:41,674
Right? So, tells me he's
willing to give me what you need,

419
00:22:41,685 --> 00:22:44,247
if I can get him those new XL kicks.

420
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,951
You know, the limited edition
ones with the gold chain on it?

421
00:22:45,993 --> 00:22:47,542
You can't afford those.

422
00:22:47,553 --> 00:22:49,597
You're right, I cannot afford those.

423
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:52,591
But like I said, miracle worker.

424
00:22:52,602 --> 00:22:54,723
So, I hit up my shoe connect

425
00:22:55,002 --> 00:22:57,000
and he tells me he's got one last pair,

426
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,844
if I can get him and his
girl a booth at the Blue Boar.

427
00:23:01,111 --> 00:23:05,023
- Even you can't do that.
- Oh, ye of very little faith.

428
00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:07,714
Peep this: I'm chilling with
my exterminator friend Pete

429
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:11,125
and he lets slip he's that he's
fumigatin' the Boar next month.

430
00:23:11,198 --> 00:23:13,358
They got roaches, big ones.

431
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:15,529
So, I go peep the
restaurant and I tell them,

432
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:17,089
if they don't want no one

433
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:18,652
to hear about this, they
gotta give my boy a booth.

434
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:20,181
So, they give the boy the booth,

435
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:22,552
he gives me the shoes, I go see Gary,

436
00:23:22,656 --> 00:23:24,056
bing, bang...

437
00:23:24,455 --> 00:23:27,097
boom, here's your new piece.

438
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,218
(CHUCKLING)

439
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,058
This isn't it. (CLEARING THROAT)

440
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:35,020
- What do you mean this ain't it?!
- But... I can make it work.

441
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,260
Guess you should call me Jesus,

442
00:23:37,302 --> 00:23:39,691
'cause it's lookin' like I'm
the real miracle worker here.

443
00:23:39,702 --> 00:23:41,956
You ain't done nothing yet. Hey.

444
00:23:44,265 --> 00:23:46,270
You really care about this bike, huh?

445
00:23:48,648 --> 00:23:51,848
Luis took me in when
I had nowhere to go.

446
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,051
The shop is my happy place
and that's thanks to him.

447
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,182
I figure it's the least I can do.

448
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:01,358
Feel that.

449
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:05,404
Yo, we're dealing with Guy.

450
00:24:05,573 --> 00:24:07,618
(SCOFFING) Oh, well, all right.

451
00:24:07,629 --> 00:24:08,868
LITTLE JOHN: What's going on?

452
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:10,370
I've got a plan to take Guy down

453
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:12,341
and you ain't talking me out of it.

454
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:16,151
Wasn't gonna. I'm in.

455
00:24:16,883 --> 00:24:18,562
Guy needs to be taken down.

456
00:24:18,998 --> 00:24:21,002
Can't do it alone.

457
00:24:21,806 --> 00:24:24,026
So, what we thinking?

458
00:24:25,508 --> 00:24:28,141
We drag him down to our level.

459
00:24:37,987 --> 00:24:40,509
ALAN: Yo, you built this yourself, LJ

460
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:43,726
Pretty cute, can't lie.
This me right here?

461
00:24:43,737 --> 00:24:46,898
All right, Robyn and I
worked on this. It's solid.

462
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:48,627
Guy wants to take collections,

463
00:24:48,638 --> 00:24:50,030
he's gonna hit this strip.

464
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,280
What if he takes a side street?

465
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,730
- He'll wanna be seen.
- Man loves an entrance.

466
00:24:53,985 --> 00:24:56,664
When he gets here,
that's your cue, Much.

467
00:24:56,675 --> 00:24:58,275
Much, you listenin'?

468
00:24:58,286 --> 00:25:00,285
Yeah. Whole plan's in my head. Trust.

469
00:25:00,954 --> 00:25:03,949
Ain't gonna work if I
can't fix her, will it?

470
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:06,651
Robyn, Alan, you're with me.

471
00:25:06,662 --> 00:25:08,297
Much draws Guy here.

472
00:25:08,737 --> 00:25:11,344
ALAN: Into the old underground lot?
Ain't it locked up?

473
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:13,696
Dad had keys for every
door in the towers.

474
00:25:13,707 --> 00:25:15,503
Always ready for a getaway, huh?

475
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:17,875
We know the underground back and front.

476
00:25:17,886 --> 00:25:20,388
We'll have the advantage.
Perfect ambush.

477
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:23,203
We'll get the cash, he'll get the
MESSAGE: No amount of money's

478
00:25:23,214 --> 00:25:26,343
- is worth messin' with Sherwood.
- I just hope he's not a slow learner.

479
00:25:26,354 --> 00:25:27,552
It'll work.

480
00:25:27,563 --> 00:25:28,923
All right, sounds good.

481
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:32,512
- One note, though... these guys are packin'.
- Just Koko.

482
00:25:32,523 --> 00:25:34,512
Guy got sent away on a weapons charge,

483
00:25:34,523 --> 00:25:35,993
now his girl carries his piece,

484
00:25:36,004 --> 00:25:37,766
'case he gets picked up.

485
00:25:37,777 --> 00:25:39,697
We get the purse, get the gun.

486
00:25:40,315 --> 00:25:42,794
If we do this right, they
won't know what hit 'em.

487
00:25:42,805 --> 00:25:45,367
Okay, cool, cool, cool.
What about the voices?

488
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:47,047
Guy knows what you two sound like.

489
00:25:47,745 --> 00:25:51,076
- Hadn't thought of that.
- I got some old headset mics,

490
00:25:51,087 --> 00:25:52,451
speaker parts.

491
00:25:53,228 --> 00:25:55,732
Maybe we could rig them to the masks,

492
00:25:55,743 --> 00:25:57,583
make them sound like the music videos.

493
00:25:57,594 --> 00:25:59,553
Like I don't have enough to do today.

494
00:25:59,753 --> 00:26:02,913
Bike first. She got any life in her?

495
00:26:03,135 --> 00:26:04,854
Those parts weren't easy to get,

496
00:26:04,943 --> 00:26:06,861
and my guy's guy don't do refunds.

497
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,508
(ENGINE SPUTTERS)

498
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,636
I'm just messin' with you.

00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:22,758
- ROBYN: That's what I'm talking about!
- Yo. Yo.

502
00:26:23,013 --> 00:26:24,950
We got one shot.

503
00:26:25,129 --> 00:26:29,393
Y'all need to study this,
memorise it. No wrong turns.

504
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,344
We go after Guy, we can't miss.

505
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:39,952
Getting pretty good with that.

506
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,797
Got some apples if you're feeling brave.

507
00:26:44,093 --> 00:26:45,540
I'll pass.

508
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:50,008
Robyn, tomorrow's gonna be crazy...

509
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:52,232
You ain't gotta worry
about Much and Alan.

510
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:55,329
I'm not. I'm worried about you.

511
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:58,856
You're bringing arrows to a gunfight.

512
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,825
We follow the plan, we'll be fine.

513
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:03,366
That's not what I meant.

514
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:08,895
Look, maybe Guy gets the
message, maybe he doesn't.

515
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:13,337
Either way, he'll come back,

516
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:15,864
and if he does, he'll be out for blood.

517
00:27:15,937 --> 00:27:18,501
So, what are you saying?

518
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:24,342
You and I both know we
might have to end this.

519
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,923
When I enlisted,

520
00:27:28,934 --> 00:27:32,053
I thought they'd put a gun in my hand.

521
00:27:32,741 --> 00:27:34,903
Instead they made me a medic.

522
00:27:37,304 --> 00:27:38,983
I ain't a killer, Robyn...

523
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:42,348
and neither are you.

524
00:27:42,973 --> 00:27:44,510
But we might have to be.

525
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:46,440
What would Lionheart say about that?

526
00:27:46,451 --> 00:27:49,333
Lionheart has nothing to say; He's dead.

527
00:27:50,638 --> 00:27:54,677
If Guy gets the chance,
he'll kill us all.

528
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:59,751
Don't get in my way.

00:39:06,396 --> 00:39:08,398
- Here.
- Thanks.

713
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:19,122
You wanna talk about what happened?

714
00:39:21,858 --> 00:39:24,257
You wouldn't have gone
there if it wasn't for me.

715
00:39:27,595 --> 00:39:28,850
Hey.

716
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,561
I didn't go there because of you.

717
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,590
Okay?

718
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,300
So... back to normal.

719
00:39:40,615 --> 00:39:44,017
Yeah, about that...

720
00:39:46,608 --> 00:39:48,348
Yo, then you came out, like, "vroom!"

721
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:50,081
And you totally had
that guy by the hoof!

722
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:51,121
Gee!

723
00:39:51,198 --> 00:39:53,438
- Hey, Rob, you good?
- ROBYN: Yeah.

724
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:57,374
That was so badass!
I feel like I'm ten feet tall right now!

725
00:39:57,385 --> 00:39:59,808
We were unstoppable.

726
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:03,318
Yeah. We were. And
maybe we shouldn't stop.

727
00:40:03,594 --> 00:40:07,043
These people think they can
just come here and take our tings?

728
00:40:07,054 --> 00:40:08,234
Uh-uh.

729
00:40:08,443 --> 00:40:13,044
We can stop 'em, take back what's ours.

730
00:40:13,813 --> 00:40:15,360
We'll pick our fights

731
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,261
and give what we steal to our people.

732
00:40:18,272 --> 00:40:21,718

music stuff, though, right?
