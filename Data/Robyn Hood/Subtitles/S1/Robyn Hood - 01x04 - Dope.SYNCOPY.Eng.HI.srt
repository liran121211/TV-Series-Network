00:00:02,038 --> 00:00:03,662
Whoever these people are, John,

3
00:00:03,673 --> 00:00:05,347
I'd say they just declared war.

4
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:07,908
Guys like Prince don't
forgive and forget.

5
00:00:08,207 --> 00:00:10,027
PRINCE: You don't think
much of me, do you?

6
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:12,588
- I'm only here to help.
- You want to help?

7
00:00:12,902 --> 00:00:14,349
Walk out that door.

8
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:16,360
JILL: Mom!

9
00:00:17,822 --> 00:00:19,180
Whoa! Talk to me.

10
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:21,200
There's nothing to talk about.

11
00:00:22,512 --> 00:00:25,480
The Mighty Hood! Hiding in the dark!

12
00:00:28,624 --> 00:00:30,622
(GRUNTING)

13
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:34,063
That was so badass! I feel like
I'm ten feet tall right now!

14
00:00:34,193 --> 00:00:36,232
We were unstoppable.

15
00:00:36,274 --> 00:00:38,443
We were. Maybe we shouldn't stop.

16
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:40,627
- To The Hood.
- ALL: The Hood!

17
00:00:40,638 --> 00:00:42,346
JILL: You're getting it!

18
00:00:42,593 --> 00:00:44,753
Looking good. So, what changed?

19
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,554
Guy Gisbourne getting run off.

20
00:00:46,596 --> 00:00:49,194
If Sherwood's still got
some fight in it, so do I.

21
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:51,838
Mr. Prince, The Hood think they beat me.

22
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:53,850
I'm just getting started.

23
00:00:58,563 --> 00:01:00,636
(LAUGHING)

24
00:01:00,678 --> 00:01:03,276
SPENCER: To your continued
support of the show.

25
00:01:03,287 --> 00:01:05,245
PRINCE: As always, Spencer, as always.

26
00:01:05,318 --> 00:01:07,032
I've gotta assure you,
the numbers are good.

27
00:01:07,043 --> 00:01:08,321
Your message is getting out.

28
00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:10,254
I swear it's gonna happen.

29
00:01:10,265 --> 00:01:11,397
What about Sherwood?

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,197
Well, Sherwood's a different story.

31
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,669
You know that.

32
00:01:15,268 --> 00:01:16,598
Come on, Spencer.

33
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,478
I'm trying to bring
paradise to New Nottingham.

34
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:21,099
You're trying to tell
me you can't sell that?

35
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,348
Blame the audience, John.

36
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:24,110
The peasants hear Bill 121,

37
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:26,991
they think, "Huh? Property
deal? Sherwood? Who cares?"

38
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:29,071
I should probably make my own
rap video and put that out.

39
00:01:29,082 --> 00:01:30,831
It seems like that's the
only way you can get through

40
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:32,400
to anybody around here.

41
00:01:32,473 --> 00:01:34,072
You asked me to keep The
Hood off of the network

42
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:38,881
and I did, John, but masked
robbers who rap about their crimes.

43
00:01:38,923 --> 00:01:41,082
It's just sexy.

44
00:01:42,274 --> 00:01:44,482
There's nothing sexier
than luxury, my friend.

45
00:01:45,112 --> 00:01:46,883
If you want to increase your ad-buy,

46
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,627
- just let me know.
- Careful, Mr. Prince,

47
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:52,172
Spence wants to gin up a bidding war.

48
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:54,124
I'd never risk it.

49
00:01:54,277 --> 00:01:56,475
Milton's meds are the
only thing standing between

50
00:01:56,486 --> 00:01:58,284
half my audience and an early grave.

51
00:01:58,295 --> 00:02:01,276

pressure, we bring it back down.

54
00:02:08,148 --> 00:02:10,308
Yeah, good to see you, too.

55
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:14,180
It's good of you to join us, Chet.

56
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:16,949
I'm starving. I could eat a whole pig.

57
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:19,048
Oh, damn! What is that?

58
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:25,254
You know, we're taking
Thanacea public this week.

59
00:02:26,203 --> 00:02:27,802
Hmm?

60
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:30,240
We're rolling out a new
rejuvenating transfusion

61
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,089
treatment and we're
looking for investors.

62
00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:37,130
I can offer premium shares
in the fastest growing

63
00:02:37,172 --> 00:02:40,896

country. Interested?

70
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:07,422
and prove that all that education
wasn't a complete waste.

71
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:08,748

terrorized an entire neighbourhood
and lost a fleet of drones.

SHERIFF: Sherwood is
the root of the problem.

117
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,152
It's like hunting rats in a dump.

118
00:05:51,163 --> 00:05:53,602
We need to flush them out.

119
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:55,691
You're not about to ask for
another set of drones are you?

120
00:05:55,702 --> 00:05:57,905
Because it's not my fault if you
can't keep track of your toys.

121
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,926
I don't need them.

122
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:04,165
Not if Sherwood hands us
The Hood on a silver platter.

123
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:07,584
Show people that
supporting these thieves

124
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:09,545
is bad for their health.

125
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:11,626
You have friends,

126
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:15,123
power-brokers who can squeeze Sherwood

127
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:17,604
- in ways they won't see coming.
- Squeeze them?

128
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,430
That's cute.

129
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:22,639
Have you not seen how they live?

130
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,650
Up close. I was born in Barnsdale.

131
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,238
They found me in a
dumpster there, anyway.

132
00:06:31,984 --> 00:06:36,246
I was raised at the orphanage,
before they tore it down.

133
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,486
You crawled out of a gutter.

134
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,001
Does that disgust you?

135
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,581
Not at all.

136
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:52,607
You know what I remember
most about that place?

137
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:54,918
Meatloaf.

138
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:58,309
The nuns served it five nights a week.

139
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,361
Freeze-dried, prison surplus.

140
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:04,550
There was this girl. Rebecca.

141
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:08,724
Big boned, twice my size,

142
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:12,253
and she couldn't get
enough of that slop.

143
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,332
So she took mine.

144
00:07:14,973 --> 00:07:17,171
Every night.

145
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,331
Gravy too.

146
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:23,990
I'm frankly surprised
you let her do that.

147
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:26,230
SHERIFF: I was living on scraps.

148
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:28,640
Thought I might starve.

149
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:33,174
But then the damnedest thing happened.

150
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:36,535
Rebecca got sick.

151
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:40,415
Fainting spells, seizures.

152
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:43,229
The nuns couldn't figure it out.

153
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:48,756
The girls thought God was
punishing her wickedness.

154
00:07:49,392 --> 00:07:53,977
In a few weeks, she passed, poor girl.

155
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,392
Are you saying that God saved you?

156
00:08:03,054 --> 00:08:07,375
I'm saying you can't
taste rat poison in gravy.

157
00:08:10,561 --> 00:08:13,571
Blackouts. Water shortages.

158
00:08:13,613 --> 00:08:16,039
Closed shops, lost jobs.

159
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,130
Make Sherwood the
shame of New Nottingham.

160
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:26,381
The city will beg me to
take it off their hands.

161
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,542
The Hood will be high and dry.

162
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:31,551
But it's messy.

163
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:34,361
The Hood is... popular.

164
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:35,770

165
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:39,619

make them the bad guys.

saved Sherwood from itself.

00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,858
Nothing's changed.

180
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:17,507
Prince is still out there,
Sherwood's still up for grabs.

181
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:21,039
Gangsters at the door,
cops harassing my friends.

182
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,784
Not like no one stepped up.

183
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:24,644
(SCOFFING) You mean The Hood?

184
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:26,133
They ran The Sheriff off.

185
00:10:26,144 --> 00:10:28,790
Guy Gisbourne ain't
coming back anytime soon.

186
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:32,592
You know what I like
most about The Hood?

187
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:36,359
Their humility.

188
00:10:37,017 --> 00:10:38,175
They make music.

189
00:10:38,186 --> 00:10:39,624
They make trouble,

190
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:42,314
and now The Sheriff has
every excuse to crack down.

191
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:44,323
Not like she needed a reason before.

192
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,164
You wanna be helpful?

193
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:49,664
Hospital only gave me a week of meds.

194
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,919
I'm out.

195
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:01,878
CROWD: I can't afford this.

196
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:04,097
I'm supposed to get this for my grandma.

197
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:07,627
Mr. Franklin. What's up?

198
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:10,893
Last week, 30 bucks
for my heart medication.

199
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:12,836
Now, it's 150.

200
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:14,806
What? That's crazy.

201
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:17,171
Please, everyone, please.

202
00:11:17,182 --> 00:11:18,978
What the hell is going on?

203
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:20,542
There's nothing I can do.

204
00:11:20,553 --> 00:11:23,279
Yeah, well, maybe we'll just
take our business elsewhere.

205
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,746
The charges apply to all medical cards

206
00:11:25,757 --> 00:11:28,116
with a Sherwood and
Forest community address.

207
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,184
Any pharmacy in the city
will charge you the same.

208
00:11:31,195 --> 00:11:32,953
It comes straight from the manufacturer.

209
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:35,440
What manufacturer?

210
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:42,804
Read it yourself. I'm sorry.

211
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:44,815
There's nothing I can do.

212
00:11:49,352 --> 00:11:52,572
_

213
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,543
Yo. Something's up.

214
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,266
We gotta check the news.

215
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,730
LITTLE JOHN: What's going on?

216
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:15,240
Yo. They don't wear
shirts in the army, fam?

217
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,718
Go get dressed and come watch this.

218
00:12:18,925 --> 00:12:20,788
SPENCER: So, you're
saying you have no choice

219
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,425
but to increase prices?

220
00:12:22,436 --> 00:12:24,394
My drivers are family to me.

221
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:26,391
Their security costs money.

222
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:29,041
And you blame The Hood
for these disruptions?

223
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:30,733
MILTON: People are afraid, Spencer.

224
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:33,382
The Hood stole cars,
destroyed police equipment.

225
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:36,866
We can't afford business as
usual under these conditions.

226
00:12:36,877 --> 00:12:38,491
But won't your increased surcharges

227
00:12:38,502 --> 00:12:40,340
affect innocent people in Sherwood?

228
00:12:41,168 --> 00:12:43,421
My customers mean the world to me.

229
00:12:43,608 --> 00:12:46,612
But these prices are a necessary
evil as long as The Hood

230
00:12:46,623 --> 00:12:49,782
remains at large, and frankly,
I think it's up to Sherwood

231
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:51,625
to take responsibility here.

232
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:54,274
The Sherwood and Forest
community will not be safe

233
00:12:54,802 --> 00:12:58,054
until someone turns these outlaws in.

234
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,689
I'm hard-pressed to
disagree, Mr. Quayle.

235
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,807
MR. FRANKLIN: Damn right,
I'm mad. We're all mad.

236
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:16,256
You know what we should do?
We should occupy the pharmacy.

237
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:18,416
We should let Udai handle this one.

238
00:13:18,846 --> 00:13:21,177
She ain't exactly shy
about making herself heard.

239
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:23,066
Sherwood doesn't need
a firebrand right now,

240
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:24,911
it needs leadership.

241
00:13:24,922 --> 00:13:27,379
You sure you're up to
this? You need rest.

242
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,098
What I need is for
people to stop treating me

243
00:13:30,171 --> 00:13:31,700
like I'm made of porcelain.

244
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,712
- Okay.
- I'm fine.

245
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:38,000
Oh, you're here. I was
just telling everyone

246
00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:40,282
we should start by
occupying the pharmacy.

247
00:13:40,293 --> 00:13:41,931
Udai, this isn't the pharmacy's fault.

248
00:13:42,217 --> 00:13:44,046
Thanacea controls the prices.

249
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:46,092
We gotta get some traction in the press.

250
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:47,970
They're already on Thanacea's side.

251
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:50,934
There are still a few journalists
we can count on out there.

252
00:13:50,945 --> 00:13:54,064
Tressie the Titan.
Just like the old days.

253
00:13:54,328 --> 00:13:56,686
She's been going full-on
since she saw the news.

254
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,694
Any luck getting her meds?

255
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,429
Every pharmacy in town's the same.

256
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:08,719
Hey. We'll figure it out, okay?

257
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,848
Why are we dancing
around the truth here?

258
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:13,136
We know who's responsible.

259
00:14:13,147 --> 00:14:14,541
It's The Hood!

260
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:18,427
Joyriding in John Prince's
car, trashing those drones.

261
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:19,916
Fighting with Guy Gisbourne.

262
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:22,214
They oughta turn themselves in!

263
00:14:22,225 --> 00:14:25,023
This is Thanacea's doing
this, not those kids.

264
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:27,745
Well, they aren't exactly
helping though, are they?

265
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:30,299
Maybe they need to
think of a song first.

266
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,539
TRESSIE: Look, I don't
like The Hood either,

267
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,140
but they're still Sherwooders,

268
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:36,600
and we don't sell out our own people.

269
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:39,513
Three days, my heart pills run out.

270
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:42,941
Then so do I.

271
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:45,414
Okay, we'll figure this out. We just...

272
00:14:46,757 --> 00:14:48,317
We will...

273
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:51,621
go to every news outlet in, umm...

274
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,423
Tressie? Tressie, are you okay?

275
00:14:56,434 --> 00:14:58,217
- I feel...
- Tressie!

276
00:14:58,228 --> 00:15:00,227
Mom? Mom!

277
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:01,436
Hey! Hey! Hey!

278
00:15:01,778 --> 00:15:04,616
Tressie? Hey, do you know where you are?

279
00:15:05,744 --> 00:15:07,304
Okay. She's passing out.

280
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:09,273
Everybody back up. Can you get me water?

281
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,981
- Yeah.
- Hey, Tressie.

282
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:14,354
Tressie, hey, hey. Drink this, okay?

283
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:16,365
ROBYN: We shouldn't
have brought her here.

284
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:45,670
She's resting.

285
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,231
She was pushing through
without pain meds.

286
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:51,534
Your mom's a tough one.

287
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:55,254
Nice way of saying
stubborn and reckless.

288
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:57,861
I looked at her 'scrips.

289
00:15:57,872 --> 00:16:00,711
Blood thinners. Antibiotics.
Anti-depressants.

290
00:16:01,806 --> 00:16:03,913
She can't go long without them.

291
00:16:04,187 --> 00:16:06,187
We gotta fix this.

292
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:17,336
Prince and princeling!

293
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:18,744
Glad you could make it.

294
00:16:18,755 --> 00:16:20,638
Thought you'd want a peek
at your new investment.

295
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:23,447
Jesus, bro, are you okay?

296
00:16:23,697 --> 00:16:26,055
Serena is a silver-medalist rower.

297
00:16:26,477 --> 00:16:29,807
Half a pint every month and
I feel ten years younger.

298
00:16:29,818 --> 00:16:31,176
Care for a sample?

299
00:16:31,187 --> 00:16:33,025
Do you have anything in a blonde?

300
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,247
Do you wanna maybe grab

301
00:16:35,257 --> 00:16:37,805
- some O.J. or a cookie later?
- Chet. Chet.

302
00:16:41,687 --> 00:16:43,885
How is Sherwood taking
to the price changes?

303
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:49,762
We're cutting off their medicine,
how do you think they're taking it?

304
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:53,953
The press is on our side.

305
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:56,365
Well, they'd better be,
those ad spots cost a fortune.

306
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:58,934
Sherwood'll fold. What
choice do they have?

307
00:16:58,945 --> 00:17:01,024
Let's talk next steps.

308
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:03,753
We have big plans for expansion.

309
00:17:03,997 --> 00:17:06,473
Up til' now it's mostly
been patent exploitation,

310
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,653
but that only takes you so far.

311
00:17:08,664 --> 00:17:11,342
Listen up, Chet, this is
what ambition sounds like.

312
00:17:11,353 --> 00:17:14,912
You two wanna make out?
I'll just leave you alone.

313
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:20,266
Always amazes me what the
peasantry will do for beer money.

314
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:25,767
Well, those are some
sad-looking lab rats.

315
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:36,471
Jesus. What are they on?

316
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:39,800
A little music, this could be a banger.

317
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:43,662
22. That's the reaction
we're looking for. Isolate him.

318
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,087
I take it you're not curing cancer.

319
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:49,855
We've modified the secretions
of Sonoran Desert Toads.

320
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:52,997
300% more potent than LSD.

321
00:17:53,294 --> 00:17:55,493
We're hoping to patent
it as an anti-depressant.

322
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:57,185
Anti-depressant?

323
00:17:58,189 --> 00:18:02,068
- Is it addictive?
- Not yet, but with a little more R&D.

324
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:05,891
Put me down for a million
shares of Thanacea.

325
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:07,903
I'll get my people to
start the paperwork.

326
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,788
(SCREAMING)

327
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,281
We've got some kinks to work out.

328
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:23,211
(CRYING)

329
00:18:24,362 --> 00:18:25,448
Delicious.

330
00:18:49,699 --> 00:18:51,631
I should've known Prince was in on this.

331
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:52,918
You okay?

332
00:18:53,211 --> 00:18:56,110
I just, I gotta get this right.

333
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,069
I put mom in this mess.

334
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:01,579
This isn't your fault.

335
00:19:02,214 --> 00:19:05,227
You've done right by
your mom, every step.

336
00:19:05,623 --> 00:19:07,221
And Sherwood?

337
00:19:07,662 --> 00:19:09,340
What if we are just causing trouble?

338
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:11,789
People are gonna get hurt.

339
00:19:11,915 --> 00:19:13,103
Prince?

340
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,027
This Quayle guy?

341
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:18,916
They're the ones
hurting people. Not you.

342
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:21,634
Robyn, hey,

343
00:19:22,114 --> 00:19:25,185
you can't make things worse
by making things right.

344
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:28,092
Trust yourself.

345
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,193
So...

346
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:41,218
I was meaning to ask you.

347
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,519
Yeah?

348
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:48,440
We should work on your wrist locks.

349
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:50,289
They're sloppy.

350
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:52,800
- Okay.
- MUCH: Hey.

351
00:19:52,922 --> 00:19:54,923
- Hey.
- LITTLE JOHN: What's up?

352
00:19:57,022 --> 00:20:02,299
Plans of Thanacea, courtesy
of the zoning office database.

353
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,006
They never change their passwords.

354
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,238
- What's this?
- Fire suppression. Inert gas.

355
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,567
Shouldn't be a problem
unless you plan on

356
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:10,776
burning down the building.

357
00:20:10,787 --> 00:20:13,506
You're not going to do that, right?

358
00:20:13,732 --> 00:20:15,732
The day's still young.

359
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:19,201
Where are we at?

360
00:20:19,358 --> 00:20:21,117
Stealing a truck is doable.

361
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:22,758
Filling it with the right medicines?

362
00:20:23,082 --> 00:20:26,441
Not gonna help Sherwood if we
show up with a crate full of Viagra.

363
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:28,120
Some people might not mind.

364
00:20:28,162 --> 00:20:29,680
Dude, ew, gross.

365
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,853
I mean, if all we need is a list,

366
00:20:32,035 --> 00:20:33,633
- I can get that.
- Mmm.

367
00:20:33,644 --> 00:20:35,881
The warehouse uses
pre-assembled pallets.

368
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,609
In order to even know
what medicines to steal,

369
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,873
we need to access the
distribution system.

370
00:20:40,884 --> 00:20:42,482
Can't we just, like, hack it?

371
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:45,082
Of course. But I'm not going to.

372
00:20:45,714 --> 00:20:48,130
The Thanacea system is offline.

373
00:20:48,141 --> 00:20:50,883
In order for me to access
it, I'd have to be on-site,

374
00:20:50,894 --> 00:20:54,933
and this corporeal form is
not getting past that security.

375
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:58,165
I'm sorry. The system is closed.

376
00:21:02,524 --> 00:21:04,179
A hotspot.

377
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,166
Something mobile we can connect to.

378
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:10,357
- Robyn finds the network junction...
- And I slide in the backdoor.

379
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:13,506
- What?
- (LAUGHING)

380
00:21:13,762 --> 00:21:15,597
Y'all are children.

381
00:21:17,428 --> 00:21:19,386
Is Much right?

382
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:23,408
The facility is far too remote
for a normal cell coverage.

383
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,528
The hot-spot would
have to be custom-built,

384
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,729
- with a serious transmitter.
- I can make it happen.

385
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,301
We can do this.

386
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,420
We have to.

I'm taking you off the street, Sergeant.

It's only been a week.
I've been behaving.

Besides, I don't really
work behind a desk.

You're mine, Redcap.

But we both know that's a lie.

Deep down,

405
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:55,035
you just want to be led on a leash.

Oh, naw. I'm actually here to
crowdfund for the neighbourhood.

411
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:31,786
Can't give freebies either.

Just give us a ballpark.

Thanacea doesn't allow generics.

420
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,510
You'll have to raise a
fortune to afford all this.

421
00:24:04,632 --> 00:24:06,407
Just have a little bit of faith.

422
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:16,812

Okay? You're scaring me.

You know, if you want me

00:26:10,266 --> 00:26:13,712
- You got a problem, Tuck?
- This is just a little more delicate

452
00:26:13,723 --> 00:26:15,457

I just thought you could use some help.

455
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,851
I also hacked your school records
and you weren't exactly straight-A.

456

Stay out of my personal shit.

457
00:26:27,683 --> 00:26:28,929
No offence,

458
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,338
but you're human and humans are flawed.

459
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:34,253
And you're not?

460
00:26:34,295 --> 00:26:36,413
One day I'll be part of the machine.

461
00:26:36,424 --> 00:26:37,526
Perfect.

462
00:26:37,702 --> 00:26:40,101
Until then, we all have our limitations.

463
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:41,387
Mmm.

464
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,928
Senior year. Shop class.

465
00:26:47,181 --> 00:26:49,739
They wanted us making door hinges.

467
00:26:51,173 --> 00:26:54,452
So I, uhh, I flex.

468
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:58,852
One day I come in, find a couple
cops pulling my work apart,

469
00:26:59,498 --> 00:27:02,099
teacher telling them I'm making a bomb.

470
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:08,440
It was an amplifier.
Got expelled anyway.

for the health of their neighbours.

715
00:42:37,686 --> 00:42:40,343

them into local heroes to boot.

- Well done.
- Loyalty is liability.

717

The Hood'll do anything
to save Sherwood.

00:42:50,016 --> 00:42:53,056
