Hi, Tressie.

182
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:53,494
I was wondering
when you'd show up.

183
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:56,295
We need your help.

184
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,255
We need
to fight for Sherwood.

185
00:09:58,355 --> 00:09:59,255
Together.

186
00:09:59,355 --> 00:10:01,456
(scoffing)
Mm-mm.

187
00:10:01,556 --> 00:10:04,616
I don't work with anyone
who won't show their faces.

188
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:06,097
You've caused
enough trouble.

189
00:10:06,197 --> 00:10:08,277
Go on and pack your things
like everyone else.

190
00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:13,638
I told you already, mom.

191
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,239
No.

192
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,800
I'm not going anywhere.

193

194
00:10:39,924 --> 00:10:41,464
You should have told me.

195
00:10:41,564 --> 00:10:42,864
Less people know the better.

196
00:10:42,964 --> 00:10:44,824
I'm not "people."
I'm your mother.

197

Why do you think I did this?

198
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:51,466
John Prince and The Sheriff
were trying to kill you.

199
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:53,466
No one was gonna help.

200
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:54,746
I had to do something.

201
00:10:54,846 --> 00:10:56,667
You did something alright.

202
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:57,667
Yeah. I did what you taught me.

203
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,067
I never taught you to steal.

204
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,028

from us every day.

205
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,548
I was just taking
some of it back.

206
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:04,648
Oh, give me a break.

207
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:09,549
I stood up for Sherwood.

208
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:11,750
For our neighbourhood.

209
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,750
Our family.

210
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,830
And you could have been killed!

211
00:11:14,931 --> 00:11:17,991
What did you expect, Robyn?

212
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:22,552
My sweet, precious child
risks her life every day

213
00:11:22,652 --> 00:11:25,193
and expects me to be grateful?

214
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:28,633
Robyn, I never wanna see you
get hurt, you understand?

215
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:30,154
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

216
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:31,554
Of course it does.

217
00:11:31,654 --> 00:11:33,834
You have kept me
safe my whole life,

218
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:37,395
given up everything for us.

219
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:39,155
For what?

220
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:42,796
For us to just give up on
everyone when they need us most?

221
00:11:42,896 --> 00:11:46,117
Robyn, I held a protest

222
00:11:46,217 --> 00:11:48,697
and they put
a bullet in my spine.

223
00:11:50,498 --> 00:11:52,438
What are they gonna do to you?

224
00:11:52,538 --> 00:11:55,859
I'm asking you, please.

225
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:59,139
Trust me.

226
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,020
Listen to her, mom.

227
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,741
You knew?

228
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:12,402
We can do this.

229
00:12:12,502 --> 00:12:14,502
We have to.

230
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:18,803
People love The Hood,

231
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:20,904
but they follow you.

232
00:12:23,024 --> 00:12:25,025
We need you to
be our voice, Mom.

233
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:37,647
I know this feels like the last
time we may see each other,

234
00:12:37,747 --> 00:12:40,688
people are leaving,

235
00:12:40,788 --> 00:12:42,808
some have families to go to,

236
00:12:42,908 --> 00:12:45,849
some have nowhere,

237
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:47,949
but not me.

238
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,890
A cop put me in this chair.

239
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,011
John Prince turned
the entire city against us,

240
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:58,991
and the Sheriff illegally
detained our children.

241
00:13:00,872 --> 00:13:03,472
We leave, they win.

242
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:07,593
You're scared.

243
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:10,694
So am I.

244
00:13:10,794 --> 00:13:14,694
But if we don't take a stand
right here and right now,

245
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,875
what happens next time they
want us to pack up and move on?

246
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:23,136
"Better a close neighbour
than a far brother," am I right?

247
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:26,277
The Hood have fought these
people off before and won.

248
00:13:28,197 --> 00:13:30,998
With our help,
they can do it again.

249
00:13:33,718 --> 00:13:35,499
Robyn: Three main entrances.

250
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:38,419
North tower, South tower,
Lionheart Hall.

251
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,100
We barricade the stairwells
and every entrance.

252
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,140
There aren't enough of us
to guard every way in.

253
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,981
So, how do we know
what she's gonna do?

254
00:13:45,081 --> 00:13:47,581
She'll concentrate on
one entrance at a time,

255
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:49,541
probe for weak spots.

256
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:51,422
She'll try to split us up,

257
00:13:51,522 --> 00:13:53,542
then overwhelm us
at a single point.

258
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:54,943
So, how do we stop her?

259
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,023
Robyn:
We know Sherwood. She doesn't.

260
00:13:57,123 --> 00:13:59,944
Wherever she hits us,
we get there first.

261
00:14:00,044 --> 00:14:01,504
Use the tunnels,
where no one can see.

262
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:03,664
What about this?

263
00:14:03,764 --> 00:14:05,625
Can't leave the back door open.

264
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:06,625
We'll need an escape route.

265
00:14:06,725 --> 00:14:08,425
The Beast don't play.

266
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:11,286
Things go south,
I need to know you can get out.

267
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:17,587
We've got enough food
and water to last a week.

268
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:19,387
Two if we ration it.

269
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:23,088
The longer we hold out,
the harder we'll be to ignore.

270
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:27,789
(clearing throat)
Oh God.

271
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:30,870

272
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,630
Homemade pepper spray.

273
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,870
Just like mom used to make.

274
00:14:34,971 --> 00:14:37,631
We need to talk to The Hood.

275
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:39,431
We're here to help.

276
00:14:39,531 --> 00:14:41,712
So grab a hammer
and start nailing doors shut.

277
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:43,432
No. I mean help.

278
00:14:43,532 --> 00:14:44,512

279

283
00:14:53,014 --> 00:14:56,455
Can I talk to you for a second?

00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:02,396
Are you crazy?

285
00:15:02,496 --> 00:15:04,476
You think you can
just pull up The Beast.

286
00:15:04,576 --> 00:15:06,917
I rescue you from The Sheriff
and this is the thanks I get?

287
00:15:07,017 --> 00:15:09,797

You just gave us a ride.

The debacle with Tressie
Loxley is headline news.

726
00:41:15,411 --> 00:41:17,871
Even in Mercia.

727
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:19,711
No one wants
a part of this mess.

728
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,772
Sherwood stays public.

729
00:41:24,412 --> 00:41:27,473
I will sue the city
for breach of contract.

730
00:41:27,573 --> 00:41:29,513
And we'll investigate
your ties to the Sheriff,

731
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:34,074
and I think Marian Fitzwalter
could be persuaded to

732
00:41:34,174 --> 00:41:38,075
share her insights into
your business dealings.

733
00:41:38,175 --> 00:41:40,876
We had an agreement, Rachelle.

734
00:41:40,976 --> 00:41:42,976
The winds have changed.

735
00:41:43,976 --> 00:41:45,977
You're on your own.

736
00:41:48,577 --> 00:41:51,818
Well, if you want
something done right.

737
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:55,639
I've decided to run for
the mayor of New Nottingham.

738
00:41:55,739 --> 00:41:57,739
I'll have your job
by next year.

739
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,840
You're joking.

740
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,361
(laughing)

741
00:42:05,461 --> 00:42:08,061

the campaign trail.

That wasn't easy.

746
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:41,268
Never said
I wanted easy, did I?

747
00:42:45,669 --> 00:42:47,569
How?

748
00:42:47,669 --> 00:42:49,449
Jill: Guys.

749
00:42:49,549 --> 00:42:51,550
Something's happening.

750
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,451
Sheriff: Earlier today,
Sergeant Gilbert Redcap

751
00:42:55,551 --> 00:42:58,451
died of injuries inflicted
by the criminal gang

752
00:42:58,551 --> 00:42:59,771
known as The Hood.

753
00:42:59,871 --> 00:43:03,452
Many people in New Nottingham
share a twisted view

754
00:43:03,552 --> 00:43:06,253
of the Hood
and their motives.

755
00:43:06,353 --> 00:43:07,893
Let me be perfectly clear.

756
00:43:07,993 --> 00:43:10,253
The Hood are not heroes.

757
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:12,214
They are not
freedom fighters.

758
00:43:12,314 --> 00:43:14,094
They are thieves,
and now killers,

759
00:43:14,194 --> 00:43:16,235
and I will
bring them to justice.

760
00:43:18,755 --> 00:43:21,096
As of this moment,

761
00:43:21,196 --> 00:43:23,656
