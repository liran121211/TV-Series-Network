Can you make sense of
this chicken scratch?

183
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,195
Are these arts tables?

184
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:21,927
Food vendors. Mom's got a shorthand.

185
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,361
So, how's it going up there?

186
00:08:24,414 --> 00:08:27,000
Wish I knew. Mom sent
me down to play host.

187
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:30,293
Hey, Mom trusted you with Lionheart Day.

188
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,133
Hey.

189
00:08:32,373 --> 00:08:34,146
These are the last to go topside.

190
00:08:34,157 --> 00:08:35,395
Are you hungry?

191
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,272
Yeah, I could eat.

192
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,596
Okay.

193
00:08:43,476 --> 00:08:44,915
(KNOCKING)

194
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:46,426
Hey.

195
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:48,636
How's it going?

196
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:51,030
We're all set up.

197
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,169
Look, um, Robyn, about Marian...

198
00:08:56,043 --> 00:08:58,416
Way ahead of you.

199
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,193
You stole her keys?

200
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:03,467
ROBYN: Let's hope she
didn't wipe the USB.

201
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,894
We get what was on Prince's laptop,

202
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:08,713
we find out what she's been hiding.

203
00:09:12,516 --> 00:09:14,153
Mm.

204
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:17,259
These are delicious. Are
they homemade, Tressie?

205
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,635
By Mrs. Soriano.

206
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:22,303
She lives upstairs, apartment 421.

207
00:09:22,422 --> 00:09:23,434
She's a baker?

208
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:25,807
Her job is cleaning toilets
at one of your properties.

209
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,044
You know I used to come
here When I was a child.

210
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:36,310
You scoff.

211
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,105
When the towers were being built,
I would stand beside my father

212
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:40,526
and watch them pouring the concrete.

213
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:42,125
If you pull the wallpaper back,

214
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:44,937
you might even find some
of my crayon-markings.

215
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,590
Let's lay our cards
on the table, shall we?

216
00:09:50,593 --> 00:09:52,712
Next week, when Bill 121 is passed,

217
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:55,533
the city is going to
sell me these towers

218
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:58,095
and all the land around them,
and you're all going to be evicted.

219
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,488
Is that what you want?

220
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,977
The council won't pass that bill.

221
00:10:02,347 --> 00:10:05,338
And I think you know that
or you wouldn't be here.

222
00:10:05,547 --> 00:10:07,317
Why take that chance, Tressie?

223
00:10:07,742 --> 00:10:09,545
I am willing to provide
new homes for you

224
00:10:09,556 --> 00:10:11,341
in developments all around the city.

225
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:12,902
You avoid homelessness.

226
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:15,841
I don't have to look like the bad guy.

227
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:17,567
It's the shoe fits.

228
00:10:19,214 --> 00:10:21,133
If I came to your penthouse

229
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:23,848
and offered you money
to leave, would you?

230
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:25,508
Yes.

231
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:27,981
For the right price, yes.

232
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,591
Of course.

233
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:33,418
Because you're alone
up there, aren't you?

234
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:37,514
Home is just square
footage for a man like you.

235
00:10:37,716 --> 00:10:40,587
Well, Sherwood is more
than just apartments.

236
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:43,455
It's more than brick and concrete.

237
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:47,026
It's the people. We're a community.

238
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:49,511
So, what gives you the right
to just tear that all down

239
00:10:49,522 --> 00:10:51,521
and scatter us to the wind?

240
00:10:51,657 --> 00:10:53,416
Because you're rich and we're poor?

241
00:10:53,972 --> 00:10:55,301
So, you can make a buck?

242
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:56,711
My father's legacy...

243
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,281
Is not our problem.

244
00:10:58,944 --> 00:11:01,847
If the city votes to
sell them, so be it.

245
00:11:02,456 --> 00:11:04,775
But we're not going to
make this easy for you.

246
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:06,849
We are not for sale.

247
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:08,774
Well, then, why did
you invite me up there?

249
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:13,124
Because we do agree on one thing:

250
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:16,094
This has gone too far and
we need to find a solution.

So, let's find a compromise,

355
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,365

Really, Tressie?

358
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:33,892
Sherwood is one of the most
underserved neighbourhoods in the city.

359
00:16:33,903 --> 00:16:35,662
We make do.

360
00:16:35,837 --> 00:16:39,197
Without a tax base, you will
always be last to the trough.

361
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,567
PRINCE: Exactly.

362
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:41,886
It's the tragedy of the commons;

363
00:16:41,897 --> 00:16:43,496
No one cares about what they don't own.

364
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:45,480
Oh, is that what you want?

365
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:46,758
- To own us?
- MAYOR LEE: Okay.

366
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:50,573
We're not going to get anywhere
without a little bit of trust.

367
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:53,795
With all due respect, Mayor Lee,
if you want to talk about trust,

368
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:56,539
we need to discuss the
charges against my client,

And when he couldn't be
bought, he destroyed his life.
