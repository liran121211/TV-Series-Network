- Bail has been set at $30,000.

That's impossible.

They see what you've earned,
and then instead of putting in the work,

- they decide to take what's yours.
- How long until the new car is delivered?

She's a leader.

118
00:06:21,994 --> 00:06:23,352

make me a few dozen.

up at some girl's place, and...

180
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:29,916
The man said "intern." Are you fried?

181
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:31,325
Bro, we can afford it now.

182
00:09:31,347 --> 00:09:32,787
Yo, you guys don't even...

183
00:09:32,798 --> 00:09:35,185
Robyn, back me up on this, okay?

184
00:09:35,653 --> 00:09:38,813
With The Hood video going viral...

185
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:40,845
Mm-hmm?

186
00:09:40,906 --> 00:09:44,287
... we should invest
in the group, right?

187
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:45,660
What do you mean, "invest"?

188
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:47,189

189

from chopping Prince's
car on new equipment.

190
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:51,198
- Not all of it.
- We should sit on it.

191
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:53,024
You can't have too much
go-money when you need it.

192
00:09:53,035 --> 00:09:55,515
No. We're not spending a
dime of that on ourselves.

193
00:09:57,093 --> 00:09:58,256
Robyn, we earned that.

194
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:01,027
We teefed it to help my
mom, not to mess around.

195
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:04,309
Okay, but lots of people need help.

196
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,687
We should buy food for
the community kitchen.

197
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:07,927
Bail fund always needs help.

198
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:09,696
No, no, Robyn. Back me up on this, okay?

199
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:11,745

Yeah. Welcome to Sherwood.

Everywhere needs money.

202
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,812
All right. So, let's make
our next score even bigger.

203
00:10:17,823 --> 00:10:20,070
Next score? Are y'all crazy?

204
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:22,559
It's not safe to spend all
that money right now anyway.

205
00:10:22,673 --> 00:10:25,271
Keeping it is not exactly safe, either.

206
00:10:26,098 --> 00:10:28,265
What about Lionheart Day?

207
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:30,825
Coming up in a few weeks.

208

Yeah.

but it could always be bigger.

211

216
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,625
No, I'm good. Thank you.

I tried buzzing up. No one was home.

220
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:10,096
I'm just a bit flustered.

Alan?

354
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,023
I'm gonna need your friend Tuck.

355
00:18:42,126 --> 00:18:44,177
You're gonna hate this next part.

356
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,512
You know, when I was a little girl,

357
00:18:57,585 --> 00:18:59,983
if Sister Amelia found the bed unmade,

358
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:02,203
she'd take it away.

359
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:04,914
Sit down.

360
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:10,985
Four names, Jill.

361
00:19:11,187 --> 00:19:12,785
Not so hard.

362
00:19:13,577 --> 00:19:14,952
How would I know?

363
00:19:15,623 --> 00:19:18,076
Hmm. Maybe you don't.

364
00:19:18,915 --> 00:19:22,912
But I got a lineup of people out there,
and someone will give me names.

365
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
Maybe even yours.

366
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:29,611
Where were you during the robbery?

367
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:32,312
There was a protest march for my mom.

368
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:34,374
Ended in a vigil.

369
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:35,543
Lots of pictures.

370
00:19:35,928 --> 00:19:38,472
- You can check.
- Yeah, I checked.

371
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:40,613
I know you were there.

372
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,485
But not your sister.

373
00:19:46,496 --> 00:19:48,234
Robyn's got nothing to do with this.

374
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:52,283
Your mother's a strong woman, huh?

375
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,783
Maybe she inspired Robyn
to do something rash.

376
00:19:57,871 --> 00:19:59,312
(SCOFFING)

377
00:19:59,946 --> 00:20:01,789
What's funny?

378
00:20:01,996 --> 00:20:04,697
Mom inspired Robyn to move out.

379
00:20:06,211 --> 00:20:08,552
She doesn't care about that stuff.

380
00:20:08,914 --> 00:20:10,600
She wouldn't rob shit.

381
00:20:12,807 --> 00:20:14,410
That's right.

382
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:18,147
You wanted me?

383
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,166
Here I am.

384
00:20:27,736 --> 00:20:29,736
Miss Loxley?

385
00:20:30,553 --> 00:20:33,654
- It's a pleasure.
- Nurse? Nurse!

386
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,171
I...

387
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:38,134
I took the liberty of asking
for a little private time.

388
00:20:38,145 --> 00:20:39,905
I hope you don't mind.

389
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:41,740
Have you seen the John
Prince Pediatric Wing

390
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:45,231
just down the way here?
It'll change your life.

391
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:47,242
Those tiny little smiles.

392
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:50,417
I cannot begin to
tell you how sorry I am

393
00:20:50,428 --> 00:20:51,586
for what happened to you.

394
00:20:51,597 --> 00:20:53,555
You sent the cops that did this to me.

395
00:20:53,703 --> 00:20:55,527
I would avoid the slanderous statements.

396
00:20:55,538 --> 00:20:56,725
From what I've been told,

397
00:20:56,736 --> 00:20:58,611
you're in enough legal trouble as it is.

398
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:02,589
Would you like a chocolate?

399
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:04,667
They're truffles.

400
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:07,256
No?

401
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,067
So...

402
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:14,414
You can't feel anything at all?

403
00:21:14,425 --> 00:21:16,625
Touch me and neither will you.

404
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:22,306
You don't think much of me, do you?

405
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,214
I'm only here to help.

406
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:26,524
You want to help?

407
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,693
Walk out that door.

408
00:21:28,856 --> 00:21:31,292
The other night, a group
of very agitated Sherwooders

409
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:34,141
broke into my home, and
they destroyed my property

410
00:21:34,152 --> 00:21:36,230
and they violated my person.

411
00:21:36,782 --> 00:21:38,388
It was, uh,

412
00:21:39,702 --> 00:21:42,462
it was a wakeup call.

413
00:21:43,276 --> 00:21:44,395
I've been callous.

414
00:21:44,406 --> 00:21:46,845
I have neglected the
needs of your community.

415
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:48,856
I admit that.

416
00:21:51,482 --> 00:21:53,547
A single mother taking on

417
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:56,614
a billionaire in her spare time.

418
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:59,014
You're struggling, aren't you?

419
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:02,749
You're desperate, lost.

420
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:05,758
And then this happens to you.

421
00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:07,769
I mean, that's hardly fair, is it?

422
00:22:10,456 --> 00:22:12,456
Miss Loxley...

423
00:22:14,982 --> 00:22:18,180
I would like to offer you $1 million.

424
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:21,495
You'll have access to specialists.

425
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,294
You'll have an accessible home,

426
00:22:24,662 --> 00:22:26,440
full scholarships for
both of your daughters

427
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:28,449
to wherever they would like to go.

428
00:22:28,635 --> 00:22:30,913
Stem cell therapy.

429
00:22:32,045 --> 00:22:34,894
I can help you walk again, Tressie.

430
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:39,308
If I let you have Sherwood?

431
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:43,787
Just stop protesting Bill 121.

432
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:45,885
Just let someone else take the hit.

433
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:48,496
Think of yourself for once.

434
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,919
You know, the worst part

435
00:23:00,499 --> 00:23:02,707
about being paralysed?

436
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:06,248
I can't shove my foot up your ass.

437
00:23:09,128 --> 00:23:11,808
You're turning me down?

438
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:18,445
Now, this is a one-time offer.
I mean, if I walk out this door,

439
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:19,974
I'm not going to come back
in here with my chequebook.

440
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:22,022
Best you don't come back at all.

441
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,791
Sherwood doesn't belong
to you. It's mine.

442
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:27,329
Your father sold it to the city.

443
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,898
My father promised it to me.

444
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:33,227
It is my land, my name, my legacy.

445
00:23:33,882 --> 00:23:36,014
So, move in.

446
00:23:36,517 --> 00:23:38,414
We take all kinds.

447
00:23:38,456 --> 00:23:40,456
(SNICKERING)

448
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,536
You are a tough nut, Miss Loxley.

449
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:48,869
I'm going to enjoy this very much.

450
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:54,289
Get well soon.

451
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:01,069
(SIGHING)

452
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:08,522
(CHUCKLING)

453
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,718
You had to know running
wouldn't look good.

454
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,854
Yeah. Well, this cop shot
my mom the other night.

455
00:24:21,287 --> 00:24:23,701
You've been a little sus ever since.

456
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,184
The guy's on the loose, by the way,

457
00:24:25,195 --> 00:24:27,153
in case you wanted to
do your job or something.

458
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:29,414
Sergeant Redcap is on
administrative leave

459
00:24:29,456 --> 00:24:30,739
pending investigation.

460
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,388
Yeah? How's that going for you?

461
00:24:33,462 --> 00:24:35,540
Post the Most.

462
00:24:35,656 --> 00:24:37,094
Backpack.

463
00:24:37,481 --> 00:24:39,305
Bought 'n' Drop.

464
00:24:39,316 --> 00:24:41,634
Is there a delivery app you
don't have a contract with?

465
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,454
A girl's gotta eat.

466
00:24:43,826 --> 00:24:45,626
It's dangerous work, isn't it?

467
00:24:45,637 --> 00:24:49,304
Out on a bike rain or
shine. All those cars.

468
00:24:49,496 --> 00:24:52,096
It keeps me fit. You should try it.

469
00:24:53,816 --> 00:24:55,854
Maybe you're more than fit.

470
00:24:56,555 --> 00:24:58,609
Maybe you can fight, too.

471
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,774
Like everyone in Sherwood?

472
00:25:00,785 --> 00:25:02,223
I see you've been saving.

473
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:05,787
You had 30 grand under your
mattress to bail out your mom.

474
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:08,758
My mom helps people. People helped back.

475
00:25:10,915 --> 00:25:12,908
We checked with your apps.

476
00:25:13,989 --> 00:25:17,349
It seems you had your phone
off the night of the robbery.

477
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:21,774
- Phone died.
- Well, you weren't at the protest.

478
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,256
You had something better to do?

479
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,244
Where were you, Robyn?

480
00:25:27,255 --> 00:25:30,295
I was at the park near the hospital.

481
00:25:32,002 --> 00:25:33,268
Alone?

482
00:25:34,435 --> 00:25:36,435
Doing what?

483
00:25:37,782 --> 00:25:39,525
What were you doing, Robyn?

484
00:25:39,536 --> 00:25:41,374
I was crying my eyes out

485
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:43,842
because my mom will never walk again.

486
00:25:45,976 --> 00:25:49,894
I know that park and every camera in it.

487
00:25:49,905 --> 00:25:51,905
We can just pull the footage right here.

488
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:55,480
(CLEARING THROAT)

489
00:25:56,482 --> 00:25:57,820
Yeah.

490
00:26:01,089 --> 00:26:04,778
Um, the website's down.

491
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:07,510
Are you kidding me?

492
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:09,185
We can pull the footage at the server.

493
00:26:09,196 --> 00:26:11,196
It won't take long.

494
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,774
I need a unit for onsite data
pickup at Alcyon Security.

495
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,534
Soak it up, Miss Loxley.

496
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,266
If you're lying to me,

497
00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:24,809
you'll never see home again.

498
00:26:25,768 --> 00:26:27,458
MAN ON WALKIE: We need an
onsite footage retrieval

499
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:29,469
from Alcyon Security.

500
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:35,689
Hey.

501
00:26:36,523 --> 00:26:38,533
I got a call for
seventh-floor maintenance.

502
00:26:38,544 --> 00:26:40,340
Not showing any issues on seven.

503
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:43,915
I guess I gotta break something
just to justify the work order, huh?

504
00:26:43,926 --> 00:26:45,828
I'll check with management.

505
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,069
Right. Just as long as it's not
the guy who put in the order.

506
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,074
Real piece of work, you know?

507
00:26:51,295 --> 00:26:53,055
- Derrick?
- Hmm.

508
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:55,304
- Andrew?
- Andrew.

509
00:26:56,565 --> 00:26:58,489
His daddy got him the job.

510
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,458
One time he told me my ass would
look better in a pencil skirt.

511
00:27:01,469 --> 00:27:02,627
He said what?

512
00:27:02,638 --> 00:27:06,012
Where's this guy's office? Let
me go talk to him real quick.

513
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:11,322
You know, today, I, uh,
really can't with Andrew.

514
00:27:11,778 --> 00:27:13,639
Is there someone else
that I can talk to?

515
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,067
(SIGHING) Building manager
should know about maintenance.

516
00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:19,291
First door on the left.
I'll buzz you through.

517
00:27:19,302 --> 00:27:20,622
Thank you. Thank you.

518
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:22,591
And stay strong, yeah? Don't let him...

519
00:27:22,602 --> 00:27:24,120
Don't let him grind you down.

520
00:27:24,131 --> 00:27:26,131
(BUZZING)

521
00:27:27,878 --> 00:27:30,001
I said get us in, not get engaged.

522
00:27:30,012 --> 00:27:32,172
You're just mad you can't make friends.

523
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:41,005
(HUMMING)

524
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:45,476
You like it? The Hood?

525
00:27:45,851 --> 00:27:47,398
You must've heard it.

526
00:27:48,198 --> 00:27:51,116
Your father was a rapper
out in Mercia, wasn't he?

527
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,563
You could say that,
but you'd be stretching.

528
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:55,938
Did the apple fall far from the tree?

529
00:27:55,949 --> 00:27:57,266
You a musical girl?

530
00:27:57,277 --> 00:28:01,423
You think looking for a rapper
in Sherwood is gonna help you?

531
00:28:01,434 --> 00:28:03,874
Kids here can spit rhymes
before they can even walk.

532
00:28:03,885 --> 00:28:05,295
Nah. It's too synthetic anyway.

533
00:28:05,306 --> 00:28:07,199
These kids have to
auto-tune themselves so much,

534
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,168
we can't even get a
voiceprint off a song.

535
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:11,012
Sounds smart.

536
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:14,033
Not really. You can't hide everything.

537
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,778
We do know the leader is a woman.

538
00:28:21,063 --> 00:28:24,193
I'm telling you, if Bella
picks Vandermere over Lucia,

539
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:25,420
I'm bailing.

540
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:30,124
Inu no Kyketauki is
objectively the best anime.

541
00:28:30,372 --> 00:28:31,890
How many seasons are we talking about?

542
00:28:31,901 --> 00:28:33,779
TUCK: Only seven. We should binge it.

543
00:28:34,264 --> 00:28:37,142
In the fifth season,
there's a heartbreaking story

544
00:28:37,153 --> 00:28:38,552
with a love potion and a demonic panda.

545
00:28:38,563 --> 00:28:41,634
I mean, you will cry. I promise.

546
00:28:41,645 --> 00:28:43,403
MUCH: All right. Let's do it.

547
00:28:45,158 --> 00:28:46,733
This is it.

548
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,763
This won't be confusing.

549
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,349
If you could pick up the pace,

550
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,796
I can only keep their
site offline for so long.

551
00:28:54,807 --> 00:28:55,887
Tuck, which one?

552
00:28:55,898 --> 00:28:58,634
TUCK: Server 506. Drive
86 should cover the park

553
00:28:58,645 --> 00:29:00,357
near the New Nottingham Memorial.

554
00:29:00,368 --> 00:29:02,606
Flip the read/write switch
and connect it to the network.

555
00:29:02,692 --> 00:29:04,140
MUCH: Got it.

556
00:29:05,585 --> 00:29:07,663
What is this?

557
00:29:07,724 --> 00:29:10,314
Easy. This footage is at 10 FBS.

558
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:13,283
Now, we just scroll for
someone with Robyn's biometrics.

559
00:29:13,425 --> 00:29:15,823
Yo, Tuck. If you pull this off,

560
00:29:15,985 --> 00:29:18,263
I've got a couple Hood
videos for you to touch up.

561
00:29:18,565 --> 00:29:21,174
Hello. We have a winner.

562
00:29:22,215 --> 00:29:23,283
We're lucky.

563
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,925
Close enough for a deep fake.

564
00:29:24,936 --> 00:29:26,845
No way this'll fool the sheriff.

565
00:29:26,856 --> 00:29:28,574
It's a deep-learning AI neural network

566
00:29:28,585 --> 00:29:31,756
with 4K resolution. The
human eye is a pinhole camera

567
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:33,760
- filled with Jell-O.
- Jell-O?

568
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,771
The All rejects one reality...

569
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:38,597
and substitutes another.

570
00:29:44,811 --> 00:29:46,400
This'll take a minute to compile.

571
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:48,791
Brah.

572
00:29:50,198 --> 00:29:52,198
You know, Sherwood used to be my beat.

573
00:29:54,365 --> 00:29:58,283
Back when I was a rookie,
I was up in these towers every night.

574
00:29:58,553 --> 00:30:01,157
Drugs, domestics,

575
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:04,024
homicides more than once.

576
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,193
Sherwood's not like that anymore.

577
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:08,798
Not since we lost Lionheart.

578
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:12,883
Sherwood don't need the Beast.

579
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,849
(LAUGHING)

580
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:17,409
I love that name.

581
00:30:17,796 --> 00:30:20,514
The Beast. It's perfect.

582
00:30:20,525 --> 00:30:22,483
Then put it on the badges.

583
00:30:22,932 --> 00:30:24,932
If only they'd let me.

584
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:31,090
So, if this place is such a paradise,

585
00:30:31,845 --> 00:30:34,645
why does your sister
say you want to leave?

586
00:30:37,158 --> 00:30:40,316
I get it. Really. I mean,

587
00:30:40,556 --> 00:30:43,634
it can't be easy living
in St. Tressie's shadow.

588
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:47,125
'Cause for her, Sherwood's
not just a home, is it?

589
00:30:48,257 --> 00:30:49,663
It's your whole life.

590
00:30:49,788 --> 00:30:52,346
There something wrong with that?

591
00:30:52,357 --> 00:30:54,334
If I were you, Robyn,

592
00:30:55,544 --> 00:30:57,563
I'd run like hell

593
00:30:57,712 --> 00:31:00,592
before this place swallows you whole.

594
00:31:04,011 --> 00:31:06,169
LITTLE JOHN: This is taking too long.

595
00:31:06,218 --> 00:31:09,096
Robyn could be in cuffs by now.

596
00:31:09,484 --> 00:31:11,008
Tuck, what's up?

597
00:31:12,744 --> 00:31:14,744
Almost done.

598
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:19,896
So, LJ.

599
00:31:20,444 --> 00:31:22,404
What's the goss, man?

600
00:31:22,415 --> 00:31:25,813
You and Robyn seemed, uh,
pretty close last night.

601
00:31:25,905 --> 00:31:28,063
She's supposed to sleep on the floor?

602
00:31:28,276 --> 00:31:30,811
Just making sure your
intentions are honest.

603
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,260
It's my best friend
we're talking about here.

604
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:36,260
- And that's saying something.
- There's nothing going on.

605
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,634
We're just friends.

606
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,917
Hmm.

607
00:31:40,744 --> 00:31:42,039
Why? She say something?

608
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,922
(LAUGHING)

609
00:31:43,933 --> 00:31:45,457
Yo. He's got it bad!

610
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:47,506
Yo. Shut up.

611
00:31:47,745 --> 00:31:49,091
It's a good thing.

612
00:31:49,102 --> 00:31:50,580
Tell her how you feel.

613
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:52,979
- Express your emotions.
- Mm-hmm.

614
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:55,347
You should write her a song.

615
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,296
Yo. What rhymes with Robyn?

616
00:31:57,307 --> 00:31:59,545
Uh, bobbin'.

617
00:31:59,556 --> 00:32:01,234
- Throbbin'.
- Throbbin'.

618
00:32:01,245 --> 00:32:03,203
- (LAUGHING)
- TUCK: Immunoglobulin.

619
00:32:03,545 --> 00:32:05,776
That would... That would work.

620
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:09,289
- TUCK: Robyn, immunoglobulin.
- Shut up.

621
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:10,817
Move.

622
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,605
- Hold up.
- Just a second.

623
00:32:12,616 --> 00:32:14,134
There's no way for us to go.

624
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:16,145
Come on. Let's go. Go!

625
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:21,088
It's unbelievable. I mean,
it's not like I went psycho

626
00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:23,509
and shot someone. The
guy was just my partner.

627
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:25,109
Sounds rough.

628
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,447
And now, all I get is the shit
jobs. Can you believe that?

629
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:30,176
Uh-huh. Drive should be over here.

630
00:32:30,327 --> 00:32:32,327
I always knew he was a prick.

631
00:32:33,692 --> 00:32:35,890
- (SOMETHING CLATTERING)
- Did you hear that?

632
00:32:35,901 --> 00:32:37,459
It's probably just the A/C kicking in.

633
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,068
We gotta keep this place super chilly.

634
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:41,079
Shh.

635
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:45,463
RECEPTIONIST: Hey. Is
this gonna take long?

636
00:32:45,474 --> 00:32:46,814
I'm supposed to be on break.

637
00:32:46,825 --> 00:32:48,825
(WHISPERING) Shh. Quiet!

638
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,958
The room's secure.

639
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:02,948
You know, you're a good listener.

640
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:04,677
Perhaps you and I could spend some time.

641
00:33:04,688 --> 00:33:06,366
Yeah. No, that's okay.

642
00:33:06,492 --> 00:33:08,492
Yep, that's okay.

643
00:33:13,478 --> 00:33:18,438
(GASPING)

644
00:33:19,005 --> 00:33:20,763
Next time we do that,

645
00:33:20,774 --> 00:33:22,892
you and I are going back to back.

646
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:26,261
- Come on.
- One of us needs body spray.

647
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:28,616
My bad.

648
00:33:28,627 --> 00:33:30,185
(PHONE RINGING)

649
00:33:30,271 --> 00:33:31,423
Tuck?

650
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:33,726
Tell me you uploaded that video in time.

651
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:46,116
TRENT: Facial ID confirms it.

652
00:33:46,612 --> 00:33:48,297
It's her.

653
00:33:50,578 --> 00:33:53,564
So, are you gonna get
out of my crib or what?

654
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:55,133
No. We'll be here for some time.

655
00:33:55,144 --> 00:33:57,262
We have a lot of suspects to process.

656
00:33:58,005 --> 00:34:00,005
You can go.

657
00:34:00,016 --> 00:34:02,232
You don't have to worry, Robyn.

658
00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:05,898
Until we catch The Hood,
we'll be right here.

659
00:34:06,457 --> 00:34:08,457
Keeping Sherwood safe.

660
00:34:13,275 --> 00:34:17,346
My mind is strong. My body is a temple.

661
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:19,908
And it's time for renovations.

662
00:34:23,835 --> 00:34:25,913
Come on, come on. No biggie.

663
00:34:25,924 --> 00:34:27,762
Whoa. Tuck, don't do it, man!

664
00:34:27,773 --> 00:34:30,051
Whoa, whoa! I'm not trying
to. Look, look, look.

665
00:34:30,354 --> 00:34:32,152
Everything's okay. Everything's... Look.

666
00:34:32,163 --> 00:34:35,554
Novocain and implants.

667
00:34:35,565 --> 00:34:36,923
They release synthetic endorphins

668
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:38,732
in response to anxiety.

669
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,581
It brings me closer to the All.

670
00:34:40,894 --> 00:34:42,772
You're doing this in my workshop?

671
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:46,537
My star chart said it was an
optimal time for self-improvement.

672
00:34:46,548 --> 00:34:49,030
You're free. We should celebrate.

673
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:51,751
I have some mezcal somewhere.

674
00:34:51,762 --> 00:34:52,764
Just...

675
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:54,903
Tuck?

676
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:57,505
It's not over.

677
00:34:57,808 --> 00:35:01,328
The sheriff's still using
drones to keep Sherwood a prison.

678
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,517
We take those away,

679
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:07,164
she'll be blind. She'll back off.

680
00:35:07,175 --> 00:35:09,081
You cracked that buzzard like a G.

681
00:35:09,092 --> 00:35:11,092
You can bring them all down.

682
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:14,699
I can't.

683
00:35:15,445 --> 00:35:18,323
I liberate secrets. I shame the corrupt.

684
00:35:19,185 --> 00:35:21,823
I am a ghost in the machine.

685
00:35:21,992 --> 00:35:23,704
This is...

686
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:26,098
This is getting way too...

687
00:35:26,185 --> 00:35:27,543
real?

688
00:35:27,554 --> 00:35:30,277
Messy, and dangerous.

689
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:35,529
I'm sorry. I can't.

690
00:35:36,672 --> 00:35:38,872
I get it. It's cool.

691
00:35:46,718 --> 00:35:48,169
Wait.

692
00:35:52,259 --> 00:35:54,659
How many drones are we talking about?

693
00:36:01,652 --> 00:36:03,652
I am not a patient woman.

694
00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:07,012
So, I'm gonna make you a deal.

695
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:10,697
The first person to identify
any member of The Hood

696
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:13,466
will be granted immunity.

697
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:16,370
The second prize is five to 10

698
00:36:17,238 --> 00:36:19,318
for obstruction of justice.

699
00:36:24,345 --> 00:36:25,513
Fine.

700
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,607
We'll continue this
conversation in holding.

701
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:34,183
Stop! This is unlawful
search and seizure,

702
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:36,312
police harassment and intimidation.

703
00:36:36,323 --> 00:36:38,561
You're repping the whole
neighbourhood now, Fitzwalter?

704
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:40,850
I filed an official complaint
with the mayor's office.

705
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:43,779
And I've got an injunction
hearing in half an hour.

706
00:36:45,518 --> 00:36:46,762
You can't just come in here

707
00:36:46,773 --> 00:36:49,493
and drag these people from their homes.

708
00:36:51,198 --> 00:36:53,198
Watch me.

709
00:36:58,312 --> 00:37:00,312
