Welcome back to the vlog,

- Introduce yourself to the people.
- Elmore.

00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:34,026
- MAN: Elmore.
- Let's go, show 'em.

- (PLAYING GUITAR)
- MAN: Can you even play?

186
00:08:35,426 --> 00:08:37,553
Oh, look at him. I see
that. Okay. Keep playing.

187
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:39,920
Let's go. Sherwood talent, baby.

188
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:40,940
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

189
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:43,264
More energy, please. Louder!

190
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:45,272
Please. I've played
everything you asked me to.

191
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:48,186
- Just give me the cash.
- CHET: I'll give you $200 for the guitar.

192
00:08:48,197 --> 00:08:50,191
- ELMORE: It's not for sale.
- CHET: Uh, $500.

ELMORE: I can't. I-I need it.

194
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:55,271
Uh, $1000.1000 bucks,
guys. What do we think?

195
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:56,631
About $1000!

196
00:08:56,642 --> 00:08:58,600

he even count that high?

15 miles that way.

could've... I could've...

Stop. This isn't your
fault. It's Chet's.

We need to hurt him.

209
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:36,259
- Make him pay.
- Yo. That's not what we do.

210
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,027
What is it we do then?

211
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:40,324

y'all were cool to forget

whatever they want to us.

Sherwood believes in us now.

225

Chet thinks no one can touch him,

226
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:36,437
