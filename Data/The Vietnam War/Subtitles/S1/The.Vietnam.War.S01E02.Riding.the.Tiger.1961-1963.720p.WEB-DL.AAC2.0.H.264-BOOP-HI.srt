JOHN MUSGRAVE: I was assigned a
listening post at Con Thien in the fall.

00:02:12,243 --> 00:02:16,245
That was like getting a
death sentence in a trial.

Because that's just three
Marines out there with a radio.

And that's the scariest thing I did.

7
00:02:21,752 --> 00:02:24,620
You're listening for the enemy.

8
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:27,756

keep thinking you're asleep

17
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:47,342
so they keep asking you, "If
your sit rep is alpha sierra,"

18
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:48,643
and then it finally dawns on them,

19
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:51,379
maybe there's somebody too
close for you to say anything.

20
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:54,349
So then they say, "If your sit
rep is negative alpha sierra,

21
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:55,850
key your handset once,"

22
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:57,818
and you damn near squeeze
the handle off the, you know,

00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,088
and two on the radio
because they're so close

24
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,857
that you can hear them
whispering to one another.

25
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:06,894
And that's scary stuff.

26
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,263
That's real scary stuff.

27
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:11,932
And I'm scared of the dark, still.

- JACK TODD: I still believed, very much,

41
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:04,851
in this concept of an heroic America,

42
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:07,621
America being a really special country,

believe about it, which...

45
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:16,829
and I didn't really see
anything wrong with that.

46
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:24,370
I was sure that we were
right to be in Vietnam.

47
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:26,506
You know, because it
started under Kennedy

48
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:29,175
and, to me, JFK was God.

right, I thought was right.

NARRATOR: At 43, John Fitzgerald
Kennedy was the youngest man

51
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:42,721
ever elected president
of the United States.

52
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:45,158
He had promised bold new leadership,

53
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:51,396
and to his supporters his inauguration
seemed to signal a new day.

we pledge our word that
one form of colonial control

57
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:05,877
shall not have passed away

58
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:11,115
merely to be replaced by
a far more iron tyranny.

59
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:16,253
We shall not always expect to
find them supporting our view.

60
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:20,824
But we shall always hope to
find them strongly supporting

61
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:26,330

remember that, in the past,

NARRATOR: The new president
gathered around him

an extraordinary set of advisors
who shared his determination

67
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:53,624
to confront communism, including
Secretary of State Dean Rusk,

68
00:05:53,626 --> 00:05:57,427
National Security
Advisor McGeorge Bundy,

69
00:05:57,429 --> 00:06:00,196
his deputy Walt Rostow,

00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:04,568
special military advisor
General Maxwell Taylor,

71
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:08,171
and Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara,

72
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:09,973
who had given up his post

73
00:06:09,975 --> 00:06:14,011
as president of the Ford Motor
Company to serve his country.

74
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:20,083
He was a pioneer in the
field of systems analysis.

Like the president who picked them,

served during World War II.

was its central lesson:

00:06:31,596 --> 00:06:35,665
ambitious dictatorships needed
to be halted in their tracks

80
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:38,901
before they constituted a serious danger

81
00:06:38,903 --> 00:06:41,037
to the peace of the world.

was determined to
overthrow the anticommunist

a more aggressive leader,

Vietnam in those days was

impossible time changing,

Vietnamese people really felt

about their government.

104
00:08:17,857 --> 00:08:20,190
The new president would
find himself caught

105
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:24,862
between the momentum of war
and the desire for peace,

106
00:08:24,864 --> 00:08:27,965
between humility and hubris,

107
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:34,238
between idealism and expediency,
between the truth and a lie.

ask not what your
country can do for you,

111
00:09:03,081 --> 00:09:05,214
ask what you can do for your country.

MUSGRAVE: I grew up in
Missouri, near Kansas City,

113
00:09:16,194 --> 00:09:19,295
a little community called Fairmount.

114
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:20,897
I was born in 1948.

115
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,532
And there were lots of kids
being born in those days

116
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:25,101
from the guys who were
lucky enough to come home

117
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:25,968
from World War II.

118
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:30,839
My dad was a pilot
in the Army Air Corps.

119
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:33,742
And all of dad's friends

120
00:09:33,744 --> 00:09:36,879
were World War II vets or Korean vets.

121
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:39,581
And all of my male
teachers were veterans.

122
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,784
And even my pastor had been a chaplain.

123
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:48,056
Well, they were my heroes,
and I wanted to be like them.

124
00:09:55,265 --> 00:09:58,266
NARRATOR: For all of John
Kennedy's soaring rhetoric,

125
00:09:58,268 --> 00:10:00,936
for all the talent he
gathered around him,

126
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:04,272
the first months of his
presidency did not go well.

127
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:08,744
He approved a CIA-sponsored
invasion of Cuba

128
00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:13,213
at the Bay of Pigs
that ended in disaster.

129
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:15,149
He felt he'd been bullied

130
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:17,585
by Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev

131
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:20,020
at a summit meeting in Vienna.

132
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:22,323
He was unable to keep the Soviets

133
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:24,759
from building the Berlin Wall.

134
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:28,996
And in Southeast Asia,
he refused to intervene

135
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:32,299
against a communist
insurrection in Laos.

136
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:36,938
Critics accused him of
being immature, indecisive,

137
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,608
inadequate to the task of
combating what seemed to be

138
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,177
a mounting communist threat.

139
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:46,714

concessions that we can make

in one year and survive politically,"

141
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,887
he confided to an aide
in the spring of 1961.

142
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:59,258
In South Vietnam, Kennedy
felt he had to act.

143
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,962
After the president received reports

144
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:04,531
that the Viet Cong might be in control

145
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:08,568
of more than half the densely
populated Mekong Delta,

146
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,639
he dispatched General
Maxwell Taylor and Walt Rostow

147
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:14,841
to Vietnam.

148
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:18,612
They urged him to commit
American ground troops.

149
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:20,346
Kennedy refused.

150
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:24,117
It would be like taking
a first drink, he said...

151
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:27,253
the effect would soon wear
off and there would be demands

152
00:11:27,255 --> 00:11:30,723
for another and another and another.

153
00:11:30,725 --> 00:11:34,193
Instead, in the midst of a cold war,

154
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:37,497
with its constant risk
of nuclear confrontation,

155
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:40,833
the president supported
a new "flexible" way

156
00:11:40,835 --> 00:11:46,406
to confront and contain
communism: limited war.

157
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:51,177
This is another type of
warfare, new in its intensity,

158
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:53,879
ancient in its origin...

159
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:58,816
war by guerrillas, subversives,
insurgents, assassins;

160
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:03,255
war by ambush instead of by combat;

161
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:05,590
by infiltration instead of aggression.

162
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:10,028
NARRATOR: To fight his "limited wars,"

163
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,997
Kennedy hoped to use
the elite Green Berets,

164
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:16,535
special forces trained
in guerrilla warfare,

165
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:19,204
counterinsurgency.

166
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:24,076
They were meant to be dispatched
to hotspots around the world.

167
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,811
ROBERT RHEAULT: Khrushchev said,
"We're not going to destroy you

168
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,379
with nuclear weapons,

169
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:31,149
we're going to destroy you with
wars of national liberation."

170
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,551
Everybody talked about the fact

171
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:38,355
that communism was spreading
and it had to be stopped.

172
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,125
You went to Command and
General Staff College

173
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,661
and you were playing on
maps with nuclear weapons

174
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,430
and so forth.

175
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:51,335
And I escaped from that by
getting into Special Forces.

176
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,105
So that instead of planning
what we were going to do

177
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:58,842
if World War III broke out,
we were actually doing stuff.

178
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,746
And Vietnam was a place where
we were going to draw the line.

179
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,383
NARRATOR: Kennedy sent the Green Berets

180
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:09,752
to the Central Highlands of Vietnam

181
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:13,389
to organize mountain tribes
to fight the Viet Cong

182
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:18,128
and to undertake covert missions
to sabotage their supply bases

183
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,297
in Laos and Cambodia.

184
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:25,801
But Kennedy understood
that counterinsurgency alone

185
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:27,003
would never be enough,

186
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:30,607
so he doubled funding
for South Vietnam's army,

187
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:35,710
dispatched helicopters and
APCs, armored personnel carriers.

188
00:13:38,882 --> 00:13:42,751
Kennedy also authorized
the use of napalm

189
00:13:42,753 --> 00:13:47,289
and the spraying of defoliants
to deny cover to the Viet Cong

190
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:51,160
and destroy the crops that fed them.

191
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:54,363
A whole array of chemicals was used,

192
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:57,832
including one named for
the color of the stripes

193
00:13:57,834 --> 00:14:03,872
on the 55-gallon drums in
which it came... "Agent Orange."

194
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:07,509
And the president quietly
continued to increase

195
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:10,478
the number of American
military advisors.

196
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:19,086
Within two years, the number he
had inherited would grow to 11,300,

197
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:21,689
empowered not only to teach

198
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:24,692
the Army of the Republic
of Vietnam... the ARVN...

199
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:26,827
to fight a conventional war,

200
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:29,063
but to accompany them into battle,

201
00:14:29,065 --> 00:14:33,701
a violation of the agreement that
had divided Vietnam back in 1954.

202
00:14:33,703 --> 00:14:37,438
(GUNFIRE)

203
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,509
The administration did its best
to hide from the American people

204
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:43,911
the scale of the buildup
that was taking place

205
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:45,813
on the other side of the world,

206
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:48,716
fearful that the
public would not support

207
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:55,655
the more active role advisors
had begun to play in combat.

208
00:14:55,657 --> 00:14:58,325
Mr. President, a Republican
National Committee publication

209
00:14:58,327 --> 00:15:01,762
has said that you are...
have been less than candid

210
00:15:01,764 --> 00:15:05,599
with the American people as
to how deeply we are involved

211
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:07,567
in Vietnam.

212
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:10,137
Could you throw any more light on that?

213
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,206
We have increased our
assistance to the government,

214
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,108
its logistics.

215
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,076
We have not sent combat troops there.

216
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,312
Though the training
missions that we have there

217
00:15:19,314 --> 00:15:22,215
have been instructed if
they are fired upon to...

218
00:15:22,217 --> 00:15:25,184
they are, would of course, fire
back, to protect themselves.

219
00:15:25,186 --> 00:15:27,019
But we have not sent combat troops

220
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:29,356
in the generally understood
sense of the word.

221
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:35,094
So that I... I feel that we
are being as frank as the...

222
00:15:35,096 --> 00:15:36,463
as we can be.

223
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:38,064
I think we... what I have said to you

224
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:40,967
is a description of our activity there.

225
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:49,175
NEIL SHEEHAN: I was a
child of the Cold War.

226
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:54,680
When I got off the plane in Saigon
on a humid evening in April 1962,

227
00:15:54,682 --> 00:15:58,617
I really believed in all
the ideology of the Cold War.

228
00:15:58,619 --> 00:15:59,752
On...

229
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:02,421
That if we lost South Vietnam,

230
00:16:02,423 --> 00:16:04,891
that the rest of Southeast Asia
would fall to the communists.

231
00:16:04,893 --> 00:16:08,795
There was an international
communist conspiracy.

232
00:16:08,797 --> 00:16:11,363
We believed fervently in this stuff.

233
00:16:12,265 --> 00:16:15,334
NARRATOR: Neil Sheehan
was a 25-year-old reporter

234
00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:18,704
for United Press International, UPI.

235
00:16:18,706 --> 00:16:22,874
He had served three years in
the Army in Korea and Japan

236
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:25,743
before deciding to
become a newspaperman.

237
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:30,048
Vietnam was his first
full-time overseas assignment,

238
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,050
and his only worry, he remembered,

239
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:36,822
was that he would get there too
late and miss out on the big story.

240
00:16:36,824 --> 00:16:41,126
Sheehan and other reporters
rode along as the ARVN mounted

241
00:16:41,128 --> 00:16:44,762
a series of helicopter
assaults on enemy strongholds

242
00:16:44,764 --> 00:16:47,165
in the Mekong Delta and elsewhere

243
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:50,635
and brought terror to the Viet Cong.

244
00:16:50,637 --> 00:16:53,771
American pilots were at the controls.

245
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:58,575
SHEEHAN: It was a crusade
and it was thrilling.

246
00:16:58,577 --> 00:17:01,145
And you'd climb aboard the helicopters

247
00:17:01,147 --> 00:17:04,481
with the Vietnamese soldiers who
were being taken out to battle.

248
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,216
And they'd take off.

249
00:17:06,218 --> 00:17:08,952
And they'd contour-fly, they'd
skim across the rice paddies

250
00:17:08,954 --> 00:17:11,221
at about three or four
feet above the paddies,

251
00:17:11,223 --> 00:17:15,091
and then pop up over the tree
lines that lined the fields.

252
00:17:15,093 --> 00:17:16,460
It was thrilling.

253
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:17,794
I mean it was absolutely thrilling.

254
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:20,864
And you believed in what was happening.

255
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:23,099
I mean you had the sense
that we're fighting here

256
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:26,936
and some day we'll win, and
this country will be a better,

257
00:17:26,938 --> 00:17:27,837
better country for our coming.

258
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:32,775
NARRATOR: The new M-113
armored personnel carriers

259
00:17:32,777 --> 00:17:36,479
were capable of churning
across rivers and rice paddies

260
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:38,381
and right through the earthen dikes

261
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:40,516
that separated one field from the next.

262
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:47,323
The Viet Cong had nothing
with which to stop them.

263
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:50,717
JAMES SCANLON: We were just
overwhelming them with force,

264
00:17:51,218 --> 00:17:52,500
with firepower.

265
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:56,499
And the firefights would be
over in a pretty short time.

266
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:59,202
MAN ON RADIO: We have some
people running along the dikes.

267
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:02,105
Actually, the canal is perpendicular

268
00:18:02,107 --> 00:18:03,672
to the one you're attacking now.

269
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:07,676
They have on black uniforms,
and I estimate approximately 3-0.

270
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:10,379
Do you have them in sight? Over.

271
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,648
SCANLON: That's what was
causing us to win, see.

272
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,885
And we were winning one after the other.

273
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:19,555
And we were not meeting a
heck of a lot of resistance.

274
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:23,358
NARRATOR: Captain James Scanlon
had been stationed in West Germany

275
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,595
and had seen for himself
the brutality with which

276
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:29,264
the communist East
Germans dealt with anyone

277
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:32,768
who dared try to escape to the West.

278
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,170
He was now in the Mekong Delta,

279
00:18:35,172 --> 00:18:38,240
an advisor to the 7th
Division of the ARVN,

280
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:42,744
and had begun to see evidence
of Viet Cong brutality as well.

281
00:18:46,215 --> 00:18:49,851
SCANLON: Those of us who talked to
the people who fled East Germany,

282
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:53,988
we saw the need to stop
the growth of communism,

283
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,425
to stop the dominoes from being tumbled.

284
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,861
That was a worthy cause.

285
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:05,366
NARRATOR: As the ARVN and their
advisors pursued the Viet Cong,

286
00:19:05,368 --> 00:19:08,102
the government of Ngo
Dinh Diem had launched

287
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:12,473
an ambitious program meant to
gain control of the countryside

288
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:15,275
by concentrating the rural population

289
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:17,945
into thousands of fortified settlements,

290
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:22,282
ringed with barbed wire
and moats and bamboo spikes

291
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:25,151
meant to keep out the Viet Cong.

292
00:19:25,153 --> 00:19:29,623
They were called strategic
hamlets, part of the effort

293
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,759
to win the hearts and
minds, and loyalty,

294
00:19:32,761 --> 00:19:34,327
of the Vietnamese people.

295
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:38,966
The French had tried something
like it a decade before.

296
00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:43,136
They had called it pacification.

297
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:45,706
ROBERT MCNAMARA: President
Diem's strategic hamlet program

298
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,240
is making substantial progress.

299
00:19:48,242 --> 00:19:52,912
About 1,600 of the some 14,000 hamlets

300
00:19:52,914 --> 00:19:56,616
have been fortified to date.

301
00:19:56,618 --> 00:19:58,951
NARRATOR: By the summer of 1962,

302
00:19:58,953 --> 00:20:02,354
news from South Vietnam
seemed so promising

303
00:20:02,356 --> 00:20:06,225
that Defense Secretary
Robert McNamara made sure

304
00:20:06,227 --> 00:20:09,394
the Pentagon was prepared
to implement a plan

305
00:20:09,396 --> 00:20:12,898
for a gradual withdrawal
of American advisors

306
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,601
to be completed by 1965.

307
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:19,271
So far as most Americans knew,

308
00:20:19,273 --> 00:20:22,241
the United States was
achieving its goal:

309
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:27,812
a stable, independent,
anticommunist state in South Vietnam.

310
00:20:29,014 --> 00:20:32,317
It was "a struggle this
country cannot shirk,"

311
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,186
the<i> New York Times</i> said,

312
00:20:34,188 --> 00:20:38,423
and the United States
seemed to be winning it.

313
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:44,263
But that same summer, Ho
Chi Minh traveled to Beijing

314
00:20:44,265 --> 00:20:47,899
in search of more help from the Chinese.

315
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:51,203
The American buildup in

that the tactics the
Americans had taught the ARVN

explain to us what was going on.

The important thing was not
to alienate the population.

00:25:57,404 --> 00:26:00,372
That if you got sniper
fire from a hamlet,

404
00:26:00,374 --> 00:26:02,774
you sent in riflemen
to take out the sniper.

405
00:26:02,776 --> 00:26:05,143
You didn't shell the place,
because you were going to kill

women and kids and destroy houses

407
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:09,813
and you were going to turn
the population against you.

408
00:26:12,318 --> 00:26:15,586
NARRATOR: Most press
coverage of Vietnam was upbeat

409

David Halberstam of

412

and Malcolm Browne of
the Associated Press,

413
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:32,370
who spent time in the field
with officers like Vann,

414
00:26:32,372 --> 00:26:36,540
were beginning to see that
from the Vietnamese countryside,

415
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:38,775
things looked very
different than they did

416
00:26:38,777 --> 00:26:42,745
from the press offices
in Washington or Saigon.

417
00:26:42,747 --> 00:26:46,983
SHEEHAN: So it was terribly
important that we not only win the war

418
00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:49,819
but that we as reporters
report the truth

419
00:26:49,821 --> 00:26:52,822
that would help to win the war.

420
00:26:52,824 --> 00:26:55,958
We were very fervent in
wanting to report the truth

421
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,029
because it was very important
to the welfare of our country

422
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:00,263
and to the welfare of the world.

423
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,102
NARRATOR: Sheehan and his colleagues
began asking tough questions

424
00:27:06,104 --> 00:27:11,141
about what constituted progress,
what victory would look like,

425
00:27:11,143 --> 00:27:13,543
and if the people in the countryside,

426
00:27:13,545 --> 00:27:17,312
where 80% of South
Vietnam's population lived,

427
00:27:17,314 --> 00:27:22,217
could ever trust the
government in Saigon.

428
00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:25,220
SHEEHAN: I remember going, during
one of Robert McNamara's visits,

429
00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:28,357
out to one of these hamlets.

430
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:29,859
The Vietnamese general
who commanded the area

431
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:31,460
was telling McNamara what
a wonderful thing this was.

432
00:27:31,462 --> 00:27:34,096
And the... the... some
of these farmers were down

433
00:27:34,098 --> 00:27:37,833
digging a ditch around
the... around the hamlet.

434
00:27:37,835 --> 00:27:40,970
And I looked at their faces
and they were really angry.

435
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,607
I mean it was very obvious to me

436
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:47,176
that if these people could,
they'd cut our throats.

437
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:55,750
NARRATOR: Farmers resented being
forced to abandon their homes

438
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:58,320
and move to strategic hamlets.

439
00:27:58,322 --> 00:28:02,458
Corrupt officials siphoned off funds.

440
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,960
And villagers blamed the Diem regime

441
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:08,930
for failing to protect
them from guerrilla attacks.

442
00:28:08,932 --> 00:28:14,203
As the people's anger grew, so
did the ranks of the Viet Cong.

443
00:28:14,205 --> 00:28:18,607
SHEEHAN: It turned out that the
Viet Cong were recruiting men

444
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:22,144
right out of those strategic...
so-called strategic hamlets.

445
00:28:22,146 --> 00:28:23,945
And then the whole program fell apart.

NGUYEN NGOC:

447
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:51,940
NARRATOR: Nguyen Ngoc's father
was a postal clerk south of Danang.

448
00:28:51,942 --> 00:28:56,544
His brothers and sisters taught
in South Vietnamese schools.

449
00:28:56,546 --> 00:29:00,313
But he joined the revolution,
and as a political officer,

450
00:29:00,315 --> 00:29:04,251
wrote poems, songs, and
slogans to inspire the people

451
00:29:04,253 --> 00:29:08,956
in the countryside to
support the Viet Cong.

452
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:13,527
DUONG VAN MAI: The Viet Cong cadre
would come in and talk to them

453
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:18,398
and their message is usually
(SPEAKING VIETNAMESE),

454
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,934
which means "turn

and bring economic and social justice."

464
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,326
NARRATOR: The Viet Cong
ran rival local governments,

465
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:51,130
complete with their own tax
collectors and school teachers,

466
00:29:51,132 --> 00:29:55,367
spies and propagandists,
and province chiefs.

467

To make matters worse,

468
00:30:00,441 --> 00:30:04,275
ARVN troops and American
advisors now found themselves

469
00:30:04,277 --> 00:30:07,312
confronted by a new threat:

470
00:30:07,314 --> 00:30:10,548
battalions of well-armed
Viet Cong soldiers,

471
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,819
as well as by local guerrillas.

472
00:30:13,821 --> 00:30:16,121
SHEEHAN: We'd armed them.

473
00:30:16,123 --> 00:30:19,591
You could hear the
arming of the Viet Cong.

474
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:23,095
Back in early '62, they only had
one machine gun per battalion.

(SINGLE GUNFIRE BURST)

476
00:30:24,264 --> 00:30:25,897
It was sporadic fire.

477
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:29,835
Then, as they captured more
and more of these American arms,

478
00:30:29,837 --> 00:30:31,803
when you made contact, it fi...

479
00:30:31,805 --> 00:30:34,072
it would build up into
a drumfire of automatic

480
00:30:34,074 --> 00:30:35,607
and semi-automatic weapons.

(CACOPHONY OF GUNFIRE BURSTS)

482
00:30:42,414 --> 00:30:45,549
RUFUS PHILLIPS: Secretary McNamara
decided that he would draw up

483
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:48,352
some kind of a chart to determine

484
00:30:48,354 --> 00:30:51,288
whether we were winning or not.

485
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,058
And he was putting things in

00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,861

who was then in the Pentagon
as head of Special Operations,

491
00:31:10,476 --> 00:31:12,609
to come down and look at this.

492
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:16,813
And so Lansdale did and he said,
"There's something missing."

493
00:31:16,815 --> 00:31:20,150
And McNamara said, "What?"

494
00:31:20,152 --> 00:31:23,787
And Lansdale said, "The feelings
of the Vietnamese people."

495
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:27,758
You couldn't reduce this to a statistic.

00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:37,668
He demanded that
everything be quantified.

Assistance Command, Vietnam,

He and his staff generated
mountains of daily, weekly,

00:31:52,983 --> 00:31:55,318
monthly, and quarterly data

504
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,387

separate indicators,

505
00:31:58,389 --> 00:32:02,891
far more data than could
ever be adequately analyzed.

(TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING)

507
00:32:06,331 --> 00:32:09,164
General Harkins had little
use for skeptical reporters

00:32:28,552 --> 00:32:31,887
And the first person
of importance that I met

516

was General Harkins.

517
00:32:34,191 --> 00:32:36,791
And he started out by saying,

518
00:32:36,793 --> 00:32:39,661
"Mr. Gregg, I don't care what
you hear from anybody else,

519

"I can tell you without a doubt
we're going to be out of here

They're caught between
the predatory guerrillas

demanding soldiery.

00:32:54,543 --> 00:32:56,944
Their lives are lived in a

always have this fear,

00:35:28,995 --> 00:35:35,299
20 years before that in a
cave in the northern part

541
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,968

542
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,504

The more you think about

work out particularly well.

You don't have the luxury
to indulge your fear

552
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:39,262
because other people's lives depend upon

You know, when something goes wrong,

they call it emotional numbing.

556
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,212
It's not very good in civilian life,

557
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,214
but it's pretty useful in combat.

558

it can't tell whether
it will meet resistance.

The troops round up all
the young men they can find,

569

since they can't tell who is
a communist just by looking.

44 provinces had its own chief.

Some were simply political appointees,

of Kien Hoa, was different.

A privileged judge's son from
the old imperial city of Hue,

with the Viet Minh.

580
00:39:30,265 --> 00:39:34,433
But he had refused to
join the Communist Party;

581
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:37,436
he admired their dedication,
but disliked the way

they punished those who
dared differ with them.

583
00:39:40,642 --> 00:39:43,775
Instead, he left the Viet Minh,

584
00:39:43,777 --> 00:39:46,978
became a major in the
army fighting against them,

585
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,882
and eventually so impressed
Diem with his insider's knowledge

586
00:39:50,884 --> 00:39:54,852
of communist tactics that
he was promoted to colonel

587
00:39:54,854 --> 00:40:00,725

00:45:09,696 --> 00:45:12,297
of the strategic hamlet program,

660
00:45:12,299 --> 00:45:16,533
ran a personal political party
that mirrored the techniques

661
00:45:16,535 --> 00:45:19,069
and the ruthlessness of the communists,

662
00:45:19,071 --> 00:45:23,340
and supervised a host of
internal security units

663
00:45:23,342 --> 00:45:27,277
that spied on and seized
enemies of the regime.

664
00:45:29,381 --> 00:45:31,582
Some reporters who probed too deeply

665
00:45:31,584 --> 00:45:34,050
into what Diem and Nhu were doing

666
00:45:34,052 --> 00:45:36,320
were ordered out of the country.

667
00:45:36,322 --> 00:45:37,454
(GUNSHOT)

668
00:45:37,456 --> 00:45:39,990
When an American journalist objected,

669
00:45:39,992 --> 00:45:44,094
Nhu's sharp-tongued wife
told him Vietnam had no use

670
00:45:44,096 --> 00:45:46,597
for "your crazy freedoms."

671
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,134
Meanwhile, out in the countryside,

672
00:45:50,136 --> 00:45:54,437
John Paul Vann and other
advisors had begun to notice

673
00:45:54,439 --> 00:45:58,207
that the corruption within
Diem's regime had filtered down

674
00:45:58,209 --> 00:46:00,276
to the commanders in the field.

675
00:46:00,278 --> 00:46:05,281
Troops, who had once been
willing to engage the enemy,

676
00:46:05,283 --> 00:46:09,485
now seemed strangely reluctant.

677
00:46:09,487 --> 00:46:14,423
God, I was told so many
times, "(SPEAKING VIETNAMESE)."

678
00:46:14,425 --> 00:46:16,359
You know, "Scanlon,
(SPEAKING VIETNAMESE)."

679
00:46:16,361 --> 00:46:17,560
Um...

680
00:46:17,562 --> 00:46:22,998
very dangerous, you
know, going out there.

681
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,768
NEIL SHEEHAN: John Vann would
go out with them at night.

682
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:29,971
And he noticed that
somebody would always cough

683
00:46:29,973 --> 00:46:33,475
or make some other slight
noise when it turned out

684
00:46:33,477 --> 00:46:35,943
that the Viet Cong were
heading into the ambush site.

685
00:46:35,945 --> 00:46:37,812
They did not want to get in a fight.

686
00:46:37,814 --> 00:46:41,115
NARRATOR: South Vietnamese
officers were chosen

687
00:46:41,117 --> 00:46:44,719
less for their combat
skill than for their loyalty

688
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:48,423
to President Diem,
and their men knew it.

689
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:51,359
RHEAULT: What we should have done is

690
00:46:51,361 --> 00:46:55,963
either forced the Vietnamese...
I mean really forced them...

691
00:46:55,965 --> 00:46:58,200
to clean up their act.

692
00:46:58,202 --> 00:47:00,302
And if they wouldn't
clean up their act to say,

693
00:47:00,304 --> 00:47:02,770
"We're out of here.

694
00:47:02,772 --> 00:47:05,606
"Because we don't bet on losing horses.

695
00:47:05,608 --> 00:47:08,142
"This is a losing horse.

696
00:47:08,144 --> 00:47:10,578
You are not going to
win this insurgency."

697
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:13,380
We, as Americans, should
have understood the desire

698
00:47:13,382 --> 00:47:17,018
of the Vietnamese people
to have their own country.

699
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,821
I mean we did the same
thing to the Brits.

700
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:30,598
NARRATOR: In October of 1962, the
United States and the Soviet Union

701
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,434
came closer than they
would ever come again

702
00:47:33,436 --> 00:47:36,303
to mutually assured destruction.

703
00:47:36,305 --> 00:47:39,373
Good evening, my fellow citizens.

704
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:43,477
This government, as
promised, has maintained

705
00:47:43,479 --> 00:47:47,348
the closest surveillance of
the Soviet military buildup

706
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:48,949
on the island of Cuba.

707
00:47:50,185 --> 00:47:52,286
Within the past week,

708
00:47:52,288 --> 00:47:55,723
unmistakable evidence
has established the fact

709
00:47:55,725 --> 00:47:59,226
that a series of offensive missile sites

710
00:47:59,228 --> 00:48:04,298
is now in preparation on
that imprisoned island.

711
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,567
NARRATOR: The Soviets had
secretly placed nuclear missiles

712
00:48:07,569 --> 00:48:10,737
90 miles from the United States.

713
00:48:10,739 --> 00:48:15,708
The Joint Chiefs of Staff urged
President Kennedy to bomb Cuba.

714
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:19,979
He resisted and instead
ordered a naval blockade

715
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:24,183
to stop Soviet ships from
resupplying the island.

716
00:48:25,953 --> 00:48:31,190
For 13 excruciating days,
the world held its breath.

717
00:48:34,862 --> 00:48:38,197
Finally, in exchange
for a private pledge

718
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:41,000
to remove American missiles from Turkey,

719
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:44,403
Khrushchev agreed to remove
his missiles from Cuba.

720
00:48:47,408 --> 00:48:50,442
Neither the United States
nor the Soviet Union

721
00:48:50,444 --> 00:48:54,546
wanted so direct a
confrontation ever again.

722
00:48:54,548 --> 00:48:57,115
From now on, limited wars,

723
00:48:57,117 --> 00:48:59,718
like the growing conflict in Vietnam,

724
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,987
would assume still greater importance.

725
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:11,062
MUSGRAVE: I'd grown up in the
shadow of the mushroom cloud.

726
00:49:11,064 --> 00:49:15,166
And I remember the... watching
President Kennedy speak

727
00:49:15,168 --> 00:49:16,901
during the Cuban Missile Crisis

728
00:49:16,903 --> 00:49:19,204
and wondering if I was
ever gonna kiss a girl.

729
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:22,106
And so this was just
continuing that battle

730
00:49:22,108 --> 00:49:24,042
against the Russians.

731
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:27,645
Only we were fighting, you
know, their, their proxies,

732
00:49:27,647 --> 00:49:30,915
the Vietnamese there... but
it was monolithic communism.

733
00:49:32,585 --> 00:49:35,553
It didn't matter to me where
it was, I was going to go

734
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:39,690
if my government said
we needed to be there.

735
00:49:39,692 --> 00:49:42,693
We were probably the last
kids of any generation

736
00:49:42,695 --> 00:49:44,095
that actually believed

737
00:49:44,097 --> 00:49:45,629
our government would never lie to us.

738
00:49:51,136 --> 00:49:53,503
SHEEHAN: We had been writing
stories about all the flaws

739
00:49:53,505 --> 00:49:56,439
on the Saigon side... about
how they wouldn't fight,

740
00:49:56,441 --> 00:49:59,209
about the corruption,
they wouldn't obey orders,

741
00:49:59,211 --> 00:50:00,610
the disorganization.

742
00:50:02,748 --> 00:50:07,351
And then all of a sudden the
Viet Cong, for the first time,

743
00:50:07,353 --> 00:50:08,886
the "raggedy-ass little bastards"

744
00:50:08,888 --> 00:50:11,688
as the Harkins's people
in Saigon called them,

745
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:13,423
stood and fought.

746
00:50:13,425 --> 00:50:15,692
And suddenly all the
flaws on the Saigon side

747
00:50:15,694 --> 00:50:18,195
were illuminated by this.

748
00:50:18,197 --> 00:50:21,431
Like a star shell, it
illuminated the battlefield.

749
00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:22,766
Everything came out.

750
00:50:24,169 --> 00:50:27,570
NARRATOR: A few days
after Christmas 1962,

751
00:50:27,572 --> 00:50:31,140
the 7th ARVN Division
got orders to capture

752
00:50:31,142 --> 00:50:33,476
a Viet Cong radio transmitter

753
00:50:33,478 --> 00:50:38,180
broadcasting from a spot some
40 miles southwest of Saigon

754
00:50:38,182 --> 00:50:41,284
in a village called Tan Thoi.

755
00:50:41,286 --> 00:50:44,153
The village was
surrounded by rice paddies.

756
00:50:44,155 --> 00:50:50,192
An irrigation dike linked it to
a neighboring hamlet... Ap Bac.

757
00:50:50,194 --> 00:50:54,564
Intelligence suggested no
more than 120 guerrillas

758
00:50:54,566 --> 00:50:57,033
were guarding the transmitter.

759
00:50:57,035 --> 00:51:00,436
John Paul Vann helped
draw up what seemed to be

760
00:51:00,438 --> 00:51:02,971
a foolproof plan of attack.

761
00:51:02,973 --> 00:51:07,309
Supported by helicopters and
armored personnel carriers,

762
00:51:07,311 --> 00:51:11,212
some 1,200 South Vietnamese
troops would attack the village

763
00:51:11,214 --> 00:51:13,248
from three sides.

764
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,217
When the surviving Viet Cong
tried to flee through the gap

765
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:20,255
left open for them, as they
always had whenever outnumbered

766
00:51:20,257 --> 00:51:22,524
and confronted by modern weapons,

767
00:51:22,526 --> 00:51:26,161
artillery and airstrikes
would destroy them.

768
00:51:26,163 --> 00:51:30,732
Vann would observe the
fighting from a spotter plane.

769
00:51:30,734 --> 00:51:36,438
But the intelligence underlying
it all turned out to be wrong.

770
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:42,077
There were more than 340 Viet
Cong, not 120, in the area.

771
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,080
Communist spies had tipped them off

772
00:51:45,082 --> 00:51:47,349
that they were soon to be attacked.

773
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:51,219
And this time they would
not flee without a fight.

774
00:51:52,822 --> 00:51:55,690
Among them was Le Quan Cong,

775
00:51:55,692 --> 00:51:59,894
who had been a guerrilla fighter
since 1951, when he was 12.

776
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:19,746
NARRATOR: At 6:35 in the
morning on January 2, 1963,

777
00:52:19,748 --> 00:52:23,183
ten American helicopters
ferried an ARVN company

778
00:52:23,185 --> 00:52:26,353
to a spot just north of Tan Thoi.

779
00:52:29,392 --> 00:52:32,626
They met no resistance.

780
00:52:32,628 --> 00:52:36,263
Meanwhile, two South Vietnamese
Civil Guard battalions

781
00:52:36,265 --> 00:52:39,400
approached Ap Bac
from the South on foot.

782
00:52:42,571 --> 00:52:46,272
The Viet Cong commander let the
Civil Guards get within 100 feet

783
00:52:46,274 --> 00:52:48,675
before giving the order to fire.

784
00:52:51,379 --> 00:52:53,980
Several South Vietnamese
soldiers were killed.

785
00:52:58,086 --> 00:53:01,154
Survivors hid behind a dike.

786
00:53:01,156 --> 00:53:04,024
(GUNFIRE)

787
00:53:04,026 --> 00:53:06,026
Ten more helicopters,

788
00:53:06,028 --> 00:53:09,763
filled with troops and escorted
by five helicopter gunships,

789
00:53:09,765 --> 00:53:10,897
roared in to help.

790
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:14,400
LE QUAN CONG:

791
00:53:38,092 --> 00:53:42,427
NARRATOR: Viet Cong machine
guns hit 14 of the 15 aircraft.

792
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:47,566
Five would be destroyed, killing
and wounding American crewmen.

793
00:53:49,169 --> 00:53:51,203
LE QUAN CONG:

794
00:53:57,544 --> 00:53:59,978
NARRATOR: The enemy concentrated
their fire on the ARVN

795
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:03,081
struggling to get out of
the downed helicopters.

796
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:06,084
"It was like shooting
ducks for the Viet Cong,"

797
00:54:06,086 --> 00:54:07,885
an American crewman remembered.

798
00:54:10,424 --> 00:54:13,458
Colonel Vann circled
helplessly overhead.

799
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,027
He radioed the ARVN commander,

800
00:54:16,029 --> 00:54:19,931
urging him to send an APC
unit to rescue the men.

801
00:54:21,435 --> 00:54:24,101
SCANLON: I got the word from John Vann

802
00:54:24,103 --> 00:54:27,004
that American helicopters were down.

803
00:54:27,006 --> 00:54:29,507
They were right in front
of the Viet Cong positions.

804
00:54:29,509 --> 00:54:33,010
We had Americans killed and wounded

805
00:54:33,012 --> 00:54:35,212
and we had to get over there right away.

806
00:54:35,214 --> 00:54:39,183
NARRATOR: Like Vann, Captain
Scanlon was only an advisor.

807
00:54:39,185 --> 00:54:42,719
Captain Ly Tong Ba,
his ARVN counterpart,

808
00:54:42,721 --> 00:54:45,456
would have to give the order to advance.

809
00:54:45,458 --> 00:54:48,725
Scanlon liked and admired him.

810
00:54:48,727 --> 00:54:51,328
SCANLON: I turned to Ba and said,

811
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,064
"Hey, you know, you got to
get over there right away."

812
00:54:54,066 --> 00:54:58,702
And Ba said to me, "I'm not going."

813
00:54:58,704 --> 00:55:02,005
NARRATOR: Ba's superiors within
the ARVN, far from the battlefield,

814
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:05,308
had told him to stay put.

815
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:09,345
And John Vann, my boss, was,
uh, screaming at me over the...

816
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:12,783
over the radio to get them over there.

817
00:55:12,785 --> 00:55:17,120
NARRATOR: It took Scanlon an hour
to convince Captain Ba to move.

818
00:55:17,122 --> 00:55:19,690
Another two hours were lost

819
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:22,726
before the APCs could make
their way through the paddies

820
00:55:22,728 --> 00:55:24,795
toward the trapped men.

821
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:29,299
The firing had died down.

822
00:55:29,301 --> 00:55:31,334
SCANLON: Everything was quiet.

823
00:55:31,336 --> 00:55:34,203
You could see the open
expanse of rice fields.

824
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:37,707
And my reaction was,
hey, it was all over.

825
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:40,910
NARRATOR: The first two
APCs dropped their ramps.

826
00:55:40,912 --> 00:55:43,445
Infantry squads stepped out,

827
00:55:43,447 --> 00:55:46,415
prepared to spray the tree
line with automatic fire

828
00:55:46,417 --> 00:55:47,817
as they advanced.

829
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:50,552
In the past, that had been enough

830
00:55:50,554 --> 00:55:53,889
to make the Viet Cong scurry away.

831
00:55:53,891 --> 00:55:56,058
This time was different.

832
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:01,964
Eight of the APCs came under attack.

833
00:56:01,966 --> 00:56:05,399
Within minutes, six of their
gunners had been killed,

834
00:56:05,401 --> 00:56:06,500
shot through the head.

835
00:56:08,071 --> 00:56:10,238
SCANLON: And boy, we got raked.

836
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,107
So it was like a pool table.

837
00:56:12,109 --> 00:56:13,641
We were on the green

838
00:56:13,643 --> 00:56:16,010
and they were in the
pockets shooting at us.

839
00:56:16,012 --> 00:56:18,780
NARRATOR: When Captain
Ba managed to convince

840
00:56:18,782 --> 00:56:21,482
a few more APCs to advance,

841
00:56:21,484 --> 00:56:24,518
guerrillas leapt from their foxholes

842
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,420
and hurled hand grenades at them.

843
00:56:31,527 --> 00:56:34,195
None did any real damage,

844
00:56:34,197 --> 00:56:37,865
but the drivers were so
demoralized that they halted,

845
00:56:37,867 --> 00:56:42,836
turned around, and withdrew
behind the wrecked helicopters.

846
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:44,938
From his spotter plane,

847
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:49,076
Vann begged the ARVN to
make a simultaneous assault

848
00:56:49,078 --> 00:56:52,280
on the enemy by all the
remaining ground forces.

849
00:56:53,516 --> 00:56:56,417
ARVN commanders refused.

850
00:56:59,021 --> 00:57:02,022
That night, the Viet Cong melted away,

851
00:57:02,024 --> 00:57:05,225
carrying most of their
dead and wounded with them.

852
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:11,731
At least 80 South Vietnamese
soldiers had been killed.

853
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:17,171
So had three American advisors,
including Captain Ken Good,

854
00:57:17,173 --> 00:57:18,172
a friend of Scanlon's.

855
00:57:22,278 --> 00:57:26,280
SCANLON: We stacked the armored
personnel carriers with bodies,

856
00:57:26,282 --> 00:57:28,015
stacked them up on top till they...

857
00:57:28,017 --> 00:57:30,017
we couldn't stack any more.

858
00:57:30,019 --> 00:57:36,223
And, um, I wouldn't let the
Vietnamese touch the Americans.

859
00:57:36,225 --> 00:57:39,092
So I carried the Americans out.

860
00:57:39,094 --> 00:57:41,461
And, um...

861
00:57:41,463 --> 00:57:43,797
And I was... I was exhausted.

862
00:57:43,799 --> 00:57:49,669
They told me about Ken
Good getting killed.

863
00:57:49,671 --> 00:57:54,106
And Ken and I had worked so
hard with our two battalions.

864
00:57:54,108 --> 00:57:59,979
And to hear that... he got killed hurt.

865
00:57:59,981 --> 00:58:01,381
(VOICE BREAKING): Great guy.

866
00:58:02,984 --> 00:58:05,284
NARRATOR: Reporters arrived from Saigon

867
00:58:05,286 --> 00:58:09,288
before all of the ARVN
dead could be removed.

868
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:13,560
They were horrified at what
they saw and tried to find out

869
00:58:13,562 --> 00:58:16,396
what had really happened.

870
00:58:16,398 --> 00:58:20,900
John Paul Vann took Neil Sheehan
and David Halberstam aside

871
00:58:20,902 --> 00:58:22,935
and told them.

872
00:58:22,937 --> 00:58:24,904
The Battle of Ap Bac had been

873
00:58:24,906 --> 00:58:27,673
"a miserable goddamn performance."

874
00:58:27,675 --> 00:58:29,976
"The ARVN won't listen," he said.

875
00:58:29,978 --> 00:58:32,979
"They make the same
mistakes over and over again

876
00:58:32,981 --> 00:58:34,914
in the same way."

877
00:58:36,717 --> 00:58:38,351
But back in Saigon,

878
00:58:38,353 --> 00:58:42,188
General Harkins immediately
declared victory.

879
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:45,191
"The ARVN forces had
an objective," he said.

880
00:58:45,193 --> 00:58:46,825
"We took that objective.

881
00:58:46,827 --> 00:58:50,363
"The VC left and their
casualties were greater

882
00:58:50,365 --> 00:58:52,965
"than those of the government forces.

883
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:54,466
What more do you want?"

884
00:58:56,104 --> 00:58:58,604
When Halberstam and Sheehan reported

885
00:58:58,606 --> 00:59:01,540
that Ap Bac had in fact been a defeat,

886
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:05,711
the U.S. Commander in
the Pacific denied it all

887
00:59:05,713 --> 00:59:08,847
and urged the reporters
to "get on the team."

888
00:59:11,318 --> 00:59:13,452
SHEEHAN: Ap Bac was terribly important.

889
00:59:13,454 --> 00:59:15,754
They had shot down five helicopters,

890
00:59:15,756 --> 00:59:18,256
which they previously
had been terrified of.

891
00:59:18,258 --> 00:59:22,394
They'd stopped the
armored personnel carriers.

892
00:59:22,396 --> 00:59:24,530
They demonstrated to their own people

893
00:59:24,532 --> 00:59:27,399
that you could resist
the Americans and win.

894
00:59:31,271 --> 00:59:33,438
LE QUAN CONG:

895
00:59:47,386 --> 00:59:51,121
NARRATOR: In Hanoi, the
Battle of Ap Bac was seen

896
00:59:51,123 --> 00:59:55,860
by Party First Secretary Le
Duan and his Politburo allies

897
00:59:55,862 --> 00:59:58,128
as evidence of the inherent weakness

898
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:01,265
of the South Vietnamese regime.

899
01:00:01,267 --> 01:00:05,101
Even when faced with American
advisors and weaponry,

900
01:00:05,103 --> 01:00:09,005
the Viet Cong had learned how
to inflict heavy casualties

901
01:00:09,007 --> 01:00:12,609
on Saigon's forces, and get away again.

902
01:00:14,279 --> 01:00:18,147
In Saigon, President Diem
claimed the ARVN were winning,

903
01:00:18,149 --> 01:00:19,549
not losing.

904
01:00:19,551 --> 01:00:22,886
Ap Bac had only been
a momentary setback.

905
01:00:22,888 --> 01:00:24,788
And he resented Americans telling him

906
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:28,492
how to fight his battles
or run his country.

907
01:00:28,494 --> 01:00:33,697
The president's sister-in-law,
Madame Nhu, went further.

908
01:00:33,699 --> 01:00:37,901
She denounced the Americans
as "false brothers."

909
01:00:39,604 --> 01:00:42,471
"We don't have a prayer
of staying in Vietnam,"

910
01:00:42,473 --> 01:00:46,609
President Kennedy privately
told a friend that spring.

911
01:00:46,611 --> 01:00:48,777
"These people hate us.

912
01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:52,214
"But I can't give up a
piece of territory like that

913
01:00:52,216 --> 01:00:56,519
to the communists and then
get the people to reelect me."

914
01:01:00,725 --> 01:01:03,458
(LOUD COMMOTION)

915
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:04,960
ED HERLIHY: Buddhist
monks and nuns are joined

916
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:06,529
by thousands of sympathizers

917
01:01:06,531 --> 01:01:08,263
to protest the government's restrictions

918
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:11,033
on the practice of their
religion in South Vietnam.

919
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:16,470
SHEEHAN: Diem began by
alienating the rural population.

920
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:19,206
And that started the Viet Cong.

921
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:22,176
Now he was alienating
the urban population.

922
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,779
HERLIHY: Seventy percent of
the population is Buddhist

923
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:26,380
and the demonstrators
clashed with the police

924
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:30,685
during the week-long series
of incidents like this.

925
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:34,121
NARRATOR: In the months that
followed the Battle of Ap Bac,

926
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:38,860
South Vietnam plunged into civil
strife that had little to do

927
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,796
with the Viet Cong.

928
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:45,933
Religion and nationalism
were at its heart.

929
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:49,736
A Catholic minority had for
years dominated the government

930
01:01:49,738 --> 01:01:52,406
of an overwhelmingly Buddhist country.

931
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:56,677
That spring in the city of Hue,

932
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:59,713
Christian flags had
been flown to celebrate

933
01:01:59,715 --> 01:02:02,916
the 25th anniversary of the ordination

934
01:02:02,918 --> 01:02:05,519
of Diem's older brother
as a Catholic bishop.

935
01:02:08,857 --> 01:02:12,226
But when the Buddhists of
the city flew their flags

936
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:17,697
to celebrate the 2,527th
birthday of Lord Buddha,

937
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:20,633
police tore them down.

938
01:02:20,635 --> 01:02:23,136
Protesters took to the streets.

939
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,275
The Catholic deputy province
chief sent security forces

940
01:02:29,277 --> 01:02:32,145
to suppress the demonstration.

941
01:02:32,147 --> 01:02:33,913
The soldiers opened fire.

942
01:02:33,915 --> 01:02:34,914
(TWO GUNSHOTS)

943
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:38,017
Eight protesters died.

944
01:02:38,019 --> 01:02:43,990
The youngest was 12; the oldest was 20.

945
01:02:43,992 --> 01:02:47,594
The Diem regime blamed the Viet Cong.

946
01:02:49,397 --> 01:02:52,998
Monks throughout the
country demanded an apology.

947
01:03:02,009 --> 01:03:04,376
They also called for
an end to discrimination

948
01:03:04,378 --> 01:03:06,811
by Catholic officials.

949
01:03:06,813 --> 01:03:10,081
Many Buddhists had come
to see Diem's policies

950
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:13,152
as a direct threat to
their religious beliefs.

951
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:19,824
DUONG VAN MAI: My family was
against what Diem was doing.

952
01:03:19,826 --> 01:03:22,528
My mother was convinced

953
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:26,631
that Diem was destroying
the Buddhist faith.

954
01:03:26,633 --> 01:03:30,835
She would go to the pagodas and
listen to the monks' speeches.

955
01:03:30,837 --> 01:03:34,139
And she was just extremely upset.

956
01:03:35,642 --> 01:03:36,941
She was not alone.

957
01:03:36,943 --> 01:03:39,944
There was a lot of people like her.

958
01:03:39,946 --> 01:03:43,915
NARRATOR: American officials
urged Diem and his brother Nhu

959
01:03:43,917 --> 01:03:47,351
to make meaningful
concessions to the Buddhists,

960
01:03:47,353 --> 01:03:49,420
for the sake of maintaining unity

961
01:03:49,422 --> 01:03:51,990
in the struggle against communism.

962
01:03:51,992 --> 01:03:53,491
They refused.

963
01:03:56,196 --> 01:04:01,264
On June 10, 1963, Malcolm
Browne of the Associated Press

964
01:04:01,266 --> 01:04:04,234
received an anonymous tip:

965
01:04:04,236 --> 01:04:07,504
something important was
going to happen the next day

966
01:04:07,506 --> 01:04:10,941
at a major intersection in Saigon.

967
01:04:10,943 --> 01:04:12,743
He took his camera.

968
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:23,921
To protest the Diem regime's repression,

969
01:04:23,923 --> 01:04:30,160
a 73-year-old monk named
Quang Duc set himself on fire.

970
01:04:48,046 --> 01:04:53,250
As a large, hushed crowd
watched him burn to death,

971
01:04:53,252 --> 01:04:56,720
another monk repeated
over and over again

972
01:04:56,722 --> 01:04:59,756
in English and Vietnamese,

973
01:04:59,758 --> 01:05:02,792
"A Buddhist monk becomes a martyr.

974
01:05:02,794 --> 01:05:05,228
A Buddhist monk becomes a martyr."

975
01:05:12,237 --> 01:05:15,204
SHEEHAN: I remember they held the ashes

976
01:05:15,206 --> 01:05:17,807
of the monk who burned himself to death

977
01:05:17,809 --> 01:05:20,910
where it was kept in
one of the main pagodas.

978
01:05:20,912 --> 01:05:27,083
And lines of people came to
pass by, and I saw these women,

979
01:05:27,085 --> 01:05:30,186
not rich women, ordinary
Vietnamese women,

980
01:05:30,188 --> 01:05:33,322
take off the one piece of gold
they had on, their wedding ring,

981
01:05:33,324 --> 01:05:38,360
and drop it in the bottle to
contribute to the struggle.

982
01:05:38,362 --> 01:05:42,264
And I thought to myself,
"This regime is over.

983
01:05:42,266 --> 01:05:43,198
It's the end."

984
01:05:47,505 --> 01:05:49,838
NARRATOR: Soon other
monks would become martyrs.

985
01:05:53,311 --> 01:05:58,947
Fresh outbursts by Madame
Nhu only made things worse.

986
01:05:58,949 --> 01:06:02,451
Burning monks made her
clap her hands, she said.

987
01:06:02,453 --> 01:06:05,053
If more monks wanted to burn themselves,

988
01:06:05,055 --> 01:06:08,256
she would provide the matches.

989
01:06:08,258 --> 01:06:10,292
The only thing they have done,

990
01:06:10,294 --> 01:06:16,064
they have barbecued one of their monks,

991
01:06:16,066 --> 01:06:21,703
whom they have intoxicated, whom
they have abused the confidence.

992
01:06:21,705 --> 01:06:26,173
And even that barbecuing was done

993
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:28,509
not even with self-sufficient means

994
01:06:28,511 --> 01:06:31,346
because they... they
used imported gasoline.

995
01:06:33,282 --> 01:06:35,983
DUONG VAN MAI: They
thought she was arrogant,

996
01:06:35,985 --> 01:06:37,585
she was power hungry.

997
01:06:37,587 --> 01:06:40,955
They suspected her and her
husband of being corrupt.

998
01:06:40,957 --> 01:06:47,328
Nhu ran the secret police, which
arrested and tortured people.

999
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:50,598
People feared the Diem regime.

1000
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:54,000
Perhaps more than they feared
it, they really hated it.

1001
01:06:56,505 --> 01:06:59,138
NARRATOR: Students,
including many Catholics,

1002
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,641
rallied to the Buddhist cause.

1003
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:04,944
So did some army officers.

1004
01:07:04,946 --> 01:07:09,383
People among the military
had to ask the question,

1005
01:07:09,385 --> 01:07:12,753
"Can we continue this
kind of situation like that

1006
01:07:12,755 --> 01:07:16,256
"when the whole country,
country was almost burning

1007
01:07:16,258 --> 01:07:17,957
with the kind of protest
from the Buddhists?"

1008
01:07:17,959 --> 01:07:18,859
You see?

1009
01:07:22,731 --> 01:07:26,399
ZIMMERMAN: I first became aware of
Vietnam because of a burning monk.

1010
01:07:29,137 --> 01:07:34,107
We had watched the civil
rights movement in the South

1011
01:07:34,109 --> 01:07:37,110
and it had set the standard for us

1012
01:07:37,112 --> 01:07:43,516
to stand up against injustice,
allow yourself to be beaten up,

1013
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:45,885
allow yourself to be attacked by a dog

1014
01:07:45,887 --> 01:07:48,254
or hit by a police truncheon.

1015
01:07:48,256 --> 01:07:50,290
And we had enormous respect

1016
01:07:50,292 --> 01:07:53,226
for people who were
willing to go that far.

1017
01:07:57,765 --> 01:08:00,866
And then one day in 1963,

1018
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:05,037
we saw on television a
picture of a monk in Saigon.

1019
01:08:06,607 --> 01:08:08,607
This was an extraordinary act.

1020
01:08:11,211 --> 01:08:14,012
Why was a Buddhist monk burning himself

1021
01:08:14,014 --> 01:08:16,649
on the streets of Saigon?

1022
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:22,087
NARRATOR: The protests continued.

1023
01:08:22,089 --> 01:08:27,059
Tensions between Washington
and Saigon steadily worsened.

1024
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:31,063
The more the Kennedy
Administration demanded change,

1025
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:34,899
the more Diem and his
brother Nhu seemed to resist.

1026
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:39,571
The White House announced
that a new American ambassador,

1027
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:44,843
former senator Henry Cabot
Lodge, was being sent to Saigon,

1028
01:08:44,845 --> 01:08:47,378
a man eminent enough,
the president hoped,

1029
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:52,517
to make Diem listen more
closely to American advice.

1030
01:08:52,519 --> 01:08:56,354
Diem professed to be unimpressed.

1031
01:08:56,356 --> 01:08:59,156
"They can send ten Lodges," he said,

1032
01:08:59,158 --> 01:09:03,127
"but I will not let myself
or my country be humiliated,

1033
01:09:03,129 --> 01:09:06,998
not if they train their
artillery on this palace."

1034
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,635
He did promise the outgoing
ambassador, Frederick Nolting,

1035
01:09:11,637 --> 01:09:14,438
that he would take no
further repressive steps

1036
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,873
against the Buddhists.

1037
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:23,180
Then, a few minutes after
midnight on August 21, 1963,

1038
01:09:23,182 --> 01:09:26,717
with Nolting gone and
Henry Cabot Lodge's arrival

1039
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:30,388
still one day away,
Diem cut the phone lines

1040
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:33,891
of all the senior American
officials in Saigon

1041
01:09:33,893 --> 01:09:37,561
and sent hundreds of his Special Forces

1042
01:09:37,563 --> 01:09:41,399
storming into Buddhist
pagodas in Saigon, Hue,

1043
01:09:41,401 --> 01:09:44,700
and several other
South Vietnamese cities.

1044
01:09:44,702 --> 01:09:47,637
Some 1,400 monks and nuns,

1045
01:09:47,639 --> 01:09:53,209
students and ordinary citizens
were rounded up and taken away.

1046
01:09:53,211 --> 01:09:56,646
(SHOUTING)

1047
01:10:00,985 --> 01:10:05,588
Martial law was imposed,
public meetings were forbidden,

1048
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:10,026
troops were authorized to shoot
anyone found on the streets

1049
01:10:10,028 --> 01:10:11,827
after 9:00.

1050
01:10:11,829 --> 01:10:15,230
PETER ROBERTS: Tanks
guard a pagoda in Saigon

1051
01:10:15,232 --> 01:10:18,000
during South Vietnam's
bafflingly complicated crisis

1052
01:10:18,002 --> 01:10:21,037
that has the government
of President Ngo Dinh Diem,

1053
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:24,907
students, and Buddhists, and
the United States government

1054
01:10:24,909 --> 01:10:28,644
all trying to guess
one another's next move.

1055
01:10:28,646 --> 01:10:32,548
NARRATOR: When college students
protested in support of the monks,

1056
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:36,251
Diem closed Vietnam's universities.

1057
01:10:36,253 --> 01:10:40,155
High school students then
poured into the streets.

1058
01:10:40,157 --> 01:10:42,758
He shut down all the high schools

1059
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,093
and the grammar schools, too,

1060
01:10:44,095 --> 01:10:47,396
and arrested thousands
of school children,

1061
01:10:47,398 --> 01:10:50,265
including the sons and
daughters of officials

1062
01:10:50,267 --> 01:10:52,468
in his own government.

1063
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:55,571
PHAN QUANG TUE: I participated
in the demonstrations.

1064
01:10:55,573 --> 01:11:02,478
I strongly believed that that
government has to be overthrown

1065
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,613
because it's a dictator government.

1066
01:11:04,615 --> 01:11:06,748
We couldn't stand it anymore

1067
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:10,552
and this is an opportunity
to rise against it.

1068
01:11:10,554 --> 01:11:14,590
NARRATOR: Phan Quang Tue was
a law student that summer.

1069
01:11:14,592 --> 01:11:18,627
His father was a prominent
nationalist whom Diem had jailed

1070
01:11:18,629 --> 01:11:21,962
for calling for greater democracy.

1071
01:11:21,964 --> 01:11:25,466
PHAN QUANG TUE: I was
and I'm still a Catholic,

1072
01:11:25,468 --> 01:11:27,835
not a very good Catholic.

1073
01:11:27,837 --> 01:11:29,770
I don't practice religiously.

1074
01:11:29,772 --> 01:11:31,539
But I'm a Catholic.

1075
01:11:33,176 --> 01:11:34,708
I was rightly arrested

1076
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:37,878
because I did participate
in demonstration.

1077
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:40,981
And I was interrogated

1078
01:11:40,983 --> 01:11:43,851
and briefly tortured,
beaten a little bit.

1079
01:11:47,423 --> 01:11:50,224
HERLIHY: Henry Cabot Lodge
took over as U.S. ambassador

1080
01:11:50,226 --> 01:11:51,825
in the midst of the turmoil.

1081
01:11:51,827 --> 01:11:53,294
And he has reported to have demanded

1082
01:11:53,296 --> 01:11:55,562
that President Diem's
brother Nhu be ousted

1083
01:11:55,564 --> 01:11:57,730
or U.S. aid to Vietnam will be cut.

1084
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:03,236
NARRATOR: In the wake
of the pagoda raids,

1085
01:12:03,238 --> 01:12:05,639
a small group of South
Vietnamese generals

1086
01:12:05,641 --> 01:12:09,376
contacted the CIA in Saigon.

1087
01:12:09,378 --> 01:12:12,845
Diem's brother Nhu was
now largely in control

1088
01:12:12,847 --> 01:12:14,947
of the government, they said.

1089
01:12:14,949 --> 01:12:19,719
What would Washington's reaction
be if they mounted a coup?

1090
01:12:19,721 --> 01:12:22,855
President Kennedy and
his senior advisors

1091
01:12:22,857 --> 01:12:27,760
happened to be out of
town, so Roger Hilsman, Jr.,

1092
01:12:27,762 --> 01:12:31,230
assistant secretary of
state for Far Eastern affairs

1093
01:12:31,232 --> 01:12:33,799
and a critic of the Diem regime,

1094
01:12:33,801 --> 01:12:37,869
took it upon himself to draft
a cable with new instructions

1095
01:12:37,871 --> 01:12:40,839
for Ambassador Lodge.

1096
01:12:40,841 --> 01:12:44,810
The U.S. government could no
longer tolerate a situation

1097
01:12:44,812 --> 01:12:49,047
in which power lay in
Nhu's hands, it said.

1098
01:12:49,049 --> 01:12:52,084
Diem should be given a chance
to rid himself of his brother.

1099
01:12:53,721 --> 01:12:57,389
If he refused, Lodge
was to tell the generals,

1100
01:12:57,391 --> 01:13:00,859
"then we must face the
possibility that Diem himself

1101
01:13:00,861 --> 01:13:04,795
cannot be preserved."

1102
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:08,533
The president was vacationing
at Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.

1103
01:13:08,535 --> 01:13:12,437
Undersecretary of State George
Ball read part of the cable

1104
01:13:12,439 --> 01:13:15,607
to him over the phone.

1105
01:13:15,609 --> 01:13:17,942
Since the early 1950s,

1106
01:13:17,944 --> 01:13:20,478
the United States
government had encouraged

1107
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:25,883
and even orchestrated other Cold
War coups in Iran, Guatemala,

1108
01:13:25,885 --> 01:13:30,488
the Congo, and elsewhere.

1109
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:34,459
Kennedy decided to
approve Hilsman's cable

1110
01:13:34,461 --> 01:13:37,628
in part because he
thought his top advisors

1111
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:39,797
had already endorsed it.

1112
01:13:39,799 --> 01:13:42,767
They had not.

1113
01:13:42,769 --> 01:13:47,972
And somehow, because of a cable
that came out from Washington,

1114
01:13:47,974 --> 01:13:51,242
Lodge decided that the
only solution was to get rid

1115
01:13:51,244 --> 01:13:55,012
of not just Ngo Dinh
Nhu, the bad brother,

1116
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:57,681
but also of Diem himself.

1117
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:59,784
And that started us
on this whole business

1118
01:13:59,786 --> 01:14:02,586
of promoting a coup.

1119
01:14:02,588 --> 01:14:06,123
And it was not a good idea.

1120
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:08,692
I just had a feeling
of impending disaster.

1121
01:14:10,062 --> 01:14:12,796
NARRATOR: On September 2, 1963,

1122
01:14:12,798 --> 01:14:16,466
Labor Day, Walter Cronkite of CBS News

1123
01:14:16,468 --> 01:14:19,102
interviewed President Kennedy.

1124
01:14:19,104 --> 01:14:23,173
The president used the
opportunity to deliver a message

1125
01:14:23,175 --> 01:14:25,108
to President Diem.

1126
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:28,845
Mr. President, the only hot war
we've got running at the moment

1127
01:14:28,847 --> 01:14:31,548
is of course the one in Vietnam,

1128
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,484
and we've got our difficulties
there, quite obviously.

1129
01:14:34,486 --> 01:14:39,122
I don't think that unless
a greater effort is made

1130
01:14:39,124 --> 01:14:41,124
by the government to win popular support

1131
01:14:41,126 --> 01:14:42,592
that the war can be won out there.

1132
01:14:42,594 --> 01:14:44,494
In the final analysis, it's their war.

1133
01:14:44,496 --> 01:14:48,397
Hasn't every indication from Saigon been

1134
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:50,499
that President Diem has no intention

1135
01:14:50,501 --> 01:14:51,500
of changing his pattern?

1136
01:14:51,502 --> 01:14:52,535
If he doesn't change it,

1137
01:14:52,537 --> 01:14:54,537
of course, that's his decision.

1138
01:14:54,539 --> 01:14:56,572
He has been there ten
years and, as I say,

1139
01:14:56,574 --> 01:14:57,974
he has carried this burden

1140
01:14:57,976 --> 01:14:59,375
when he has been counted
out on a number of occasions.

1141
01:14:59,377 --> 01:15:00,509
Our best judgment is

1142
01:15:00,511 --> 01:15:03,046
that he can't be
successful in this basis.

1143
01:15:03,048 --> 01:15:05,715
But I don't agree with those
who say we should withdraw.

1144
01:15:05,717 --> 01:15:06,983
That would be a great mistake.

1145
01:15:06,985 --> 01:15:08,384
That'd be a great mistake.

1146
01:15:08,386 --> 01:15:10,320
I know people don't like
Americans to be engaged

1147
01:15:10,322 --> 01:15:11,420
in this kind of an effort.

1148
01:15:11,422 --> 01:15:13,890
47 Americans have been killed.

1149
01:15:13,892 --> 01:15:15,959
We're in a very

1150
01:15:15,961 --> 01:15:18,794
desperate struggle against
the communist system.

1151
01:15:18,796 --> 01:15:22,097
And I don't want Asia to pass
into the control of the Chinese.

1152
01:15:22,099 --> 01:15:24,333
Do you think that this
government still has time

1153
01:15:24,335 --> 01:15:26,869
to... to regain the
support of the people?

1154
01:15:26,871 --> 01:15:28,904
I do, I do.

1155
01:15:28,906 --> 01:15:32,207
With changes in policy
and perhaps in personnel,

1156
01:15:32,209 --> 01:15:33,876
I think it can.

1157
01:15:33,878 --> 01:15:37,445
If it doesn't make those changes,

1158
01:15:37,447 --> 01:15:39,514
I would think that the
chances of winning it

1159
01:15:39,516 --> 01:15:41,049
would not be very good.

1160
01:15:42,987 --> 01:15:45,888
NARRATOR: Despite the cable,
Kennedy and his advisors

1161
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:49,224
were sharply divided about a coup.

1162
01:15:49,226 --> 01:15:54,596
Robert McNamara, Maxwell Taylor,
Vice President Lyndon Johnson,

1163
01:15:54,598 --> 01:15:59,033
and the head of the CIA
all cautioned against it,

1164
01:15:59,035 --> 01:16:02,504
because, while none of them
especially admired Diem,

1165
01:16:02,506 --> 01:16:07,174
they did not believe there
was any viable alternative.

1166
01:16:07,176 --> 01:16:10,211
GREGG: Fritz Nolting was called in.

1167
01:16:10,213 --> 01:16:12,781
And he said, "As difficult
as they are to deal with,

1168
01:16:12,783 --> 01:16:17,786
"there is nobody with the
guts and sangfroid in Vietnam

1169
01:16:17,788 --> 01:16:19,654
"of Diem and his brother Nhu.

1170
01:16:19,656 --> 01:16:23,124
"And if we let them
go, we will be saddled

1171
01:16:23,126 --> 01:16:27,028
by a descending cycle
of mediocre generals."

1172
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:28,863
And he was absolutely correct.

1173
01:16:30,767 --> 01:16:33,634
NARRATOR: But several State
Department officials believed

1174
01:16:33,636 --> 01:16:38,505
that without fresh leadership,
South Vietnam could not survive.

1175
01:16:38,507 --> 01:16:41,642
The debate intensified.

1176
01:16:42,945 --> 01:16:44,978
"My God," the president said,

1177
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:48,348
"my administration is coming apart."

1178
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:51,752
In the end, Kennedy instructed Lodge

1179
01:16:51,754 --> 01:16:54,220
to tell the renegade generals

1180
01:16:54,222 --> 01:16:56,623
that while the United
States does not wish

1181
01:16:56,625 --> 01:17:00,427
to stimulate a coup, it
would not thwart one either.

1182
01:17:02,064 --> 01:17:05,165
The generals laid their plans.

1183
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:07,568
(GUNFIRE)

1184
01:17:11,506 --> 01:17:17,143
On November 1, 1963,
troops loyal to the plotters

1185
01:17:17,145 --> 01:17:19,412
seized key installations in Saigon

1186
01:17:19,414 --> 01:17:22,715
and demanded Diem and Nhu surrender.

1187
01:17:25,487 --> 01:17:27,988
REPORTER: The battle for
the city went on for 18 hours

1188
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:31,324
and most of it was centered
on the presidential palace.

1189
01:17:31,326 --> 01:17:34,660
Just after 6:30 in the morning
Saturday, the shooting ceased.

1190
01:17:37,099 --> 01:17:38,865
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

1191
01:17:43,837 --> 01:17:49,108
NARRATOR: Diem and Nhu escaped,
took sanctuary in a church,

1192
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:52,244
and agreed to surrender
to the rebels in exchange

1193
01:17:52,246 --> 01:17:56,048
for the promise of safe
passage out of the country.

1194
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:59,551
They were picked up in an
armored personnel carrier...

1195
01:17:59,553 --> 01:18:01,553
(GUNSHOT)

1196
01:18:01,555 --> 01:18:05,690
And murdered soon after
they climbed inside.

1197
01:18:05,692 --> 01:18:06,925
(GUNSHOT)

1198
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:13,965
Madame Nhu survived the coup.

1199
01:18:13,967 --> 01:18:17,036
She was on a goodwill
tour in the United States.

1200
01:18:22,509 --> 01:18:25,076
PHAN QUANG TUE: The system
was overthrown on November 1.

1201
01:18:25,078 --> 01:18:27,846
I was released November 4.

1202
01:18:27,848 --> 01:18:33,818
And it was the most exciting
moment in the life of Saigon.

1203
01:18:35,856 --> 01:18:41,259
The excitement, you
could feel it in the air.

1204
01:18:41,261 --> 01:18:45,764
DUONG VAN MAI: I was thinking
that, yeah, it's a good thing.

1205
01:18:45,766 --> 01:18:49,433
Diem was making it
impossible to win the war

1206
01:18:49,435 --> 01:18:53,003
because people were so against him

1207
01:18:53,005 --> 01:18:57,307
that the war would be
lost if he stayed in power.

1208
01:18:59,111 --> 01:19:01,344
My father was a bit worried

1209
01:19:01,346 --> 01:19:03,180
because he didn't know who
was going to replace Diem.

1210
01:19:06,185 --> 01:19:08,819
NARRATOR: Ambassador Lodge
reported to Washington

1211
01:19:08,821 --> 01:19:13,423
that "every Vietnamese has
a smile on his face today."

1212
01:19:13,425 --> 01:19:17,160
"The prospects are now for
a shorter war," he said,

1213
01:19:17,162 --> 01:19:20,130
"provided the generals stay together.

1214
01:19:20,132 --> 01:19:22,933
"Certainly officers and soldiers

1215
01:19:22,935 --> 01:19:26,169
who can pull off an operation
like this," he continued,

1216
01:19:26,171 --> 01:19:29,539
"should be able to do very
well on the battlefield

1217
01:19:29,541 --> 01:19:31,874
if their hearts are in it."

1218
01:19:34,946 --> 01:19:38,115
President Kennedy was not so sure.

1219
01:19:38,117 --> 01:19:42,519
He was appalled that Diem
and Nhu had been killed.

1220
01:19:42,521 --> 01:19:46,189
Three days later, he dictated
his own rueful account

1221
01:19:46,191 --> 01:19:50,093
of the coup and his
concerns for the future.

1222
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:55,798
KENNEDY: Monday, November 4, 1963.

1223
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:58,800
Over the weekend the
coup in Saigon took place.

1224
01:19:58,802 --> 01:20:01,703
It culminated three
months of conversation,

1225
01:20:01,705 --> 01:20:07,009
which divided the government
here and in Saigon.

1226
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:12,148
I feel that we must bear a good
deal of responsibility for it,

1227
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:15,184
beginning with our cable of August

1228
01:20:15,186 --> 01:20:17,919
in which we suggested the coup.

1229
01:20:17,921 --> 01:20:20,756
I should not have given my consent to it

1230
01:20:20,758 --> 01:20:22,924
without a roundtable conference.

1231
01:20:25,129 --> 01:20:30,633
I was shocked by the
death of Diem and Nhu.

1232
01:20:30,635 --> 01:20:34,835
The way he was killed made
it particularly abhorrent.

1233
01:20:34,837 --> 01:20:37,405
The question now is whether
the generals can stay together

1234
01:20:37,407 --> 01:20:41,376
and build a stable government or
whether public opinion in Saigon

1235
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:45,079
will turn on this government
as repressive and undemocratic

1236
01:20:45,081 --> 01:20:46,881
in the not-too-distant future.

1237
01:20:52,055 --> 01:20:54,389
NARRATOR: Kennedy would
not live to see the answer

1238
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:57,024
to the question he had asked.

1239
01:20:57,026 --> 01:21:01,563
He was murdered in Dallas 18 days later.

1240
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:06,568
There were now 16,000 American
advisors in South Vietnam.

1241
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:12,006
Their fate and the fate of
that embattled country rested

1242
01:21:12,008 --> 01:21:17,244
with another American
president, Lyndon Baines Johnson.

SHEEHAN: We thought we were
the exceptions to history,

we Americans.

1246
01:21:38,467 --> 01:21:41,202
History didn't apply to us.

1247
01:21:41,204 --> 01:21:43,436
We could never fight a bad war.

1248
01:21:43,438 --> 01:21:45,438
We could never represent
the wrong cause.

1249
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:46,439
We were Americans.

1250
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,109
Well, in Vietnam it proved

1251
01:21:49,111 --> 01:21:51,477
that we were not an
exception to history.
