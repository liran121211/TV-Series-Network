Major support for "The Vietnam War"

2

and by these additional funders.

14
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:37,533
Major funding was also provided

15
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:39,265
by David H. Koch...

by the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting,

26
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,733
Thank you.

27
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:15,400
Bank of America proudly supports

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,299
Ken Burns' and Lynn Novick's
film "The Vietnam War"

29
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:22,700
because fostering different perspectives

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,299
and civil discourse
around important issues

31
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:27,599
furthers progress, equality,

32
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,599
and a more connected society.

34
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:42,255
Coming home from Vietnam

35
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:46,155
was close to as traumatic
as the war itself.

36
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:51,056
For years, nobody talked about Vietnam.

37
00:02:54,223 --> 00:02:55,755
We were friends with a young couple

38
00:02:55,855 --> 00:03:00,556
and it was only after 12 years
that the two wives were talking.

39
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:04,022
Found out that we both had
been Marines in Vietnam.

40
00:03:04,123 --> 00:03:06,623
Never said a word about it.

41
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:08,422
Never mentioned it.

42
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,589
And the whole country was like that.

43
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:14,922
It was so divisive.

44
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:19,956
And it's like living in a
family with an alcoholic father.

45
00:03:20,056 --> 00:03:22,390
"Shh, we don't talk about that."

46
00:03:24,855 --> 00:03:26,755
Our country did that with Vietnam.

47
00:03:26,855 --> 00:03:29,589
It's only been very
recently that, I think,

48
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:32,355
that, you know, the baby boomers
are finally starting to say,

49
00:03:32,456 --> 00:03:33,723
"What happened?

50
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:35,155
What happened?"

51
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,855
What we need now in this country

52
00:03:46,956 --> 00:03:51,255
is to heal the wounds and
to put Vietnam behind us.

53
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,723
The killing

54
00:04:04,822 --> 00:04:06,623
in this tragic war must stop.

55
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,922
General Westmoreland's strategy

56
00:04:20,023 --> 00:04:21,689
is producing results.

57
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,956
The enemy is no longer
closer to victory.

58
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,189
No matter how you measure it,

59
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,155
we're better off than we
thought we would be at this time.

60
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,355
You have been less than candid

61
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:50,056
as to how deeply we
are involved in Vietnam.

62
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:51,756
We have increased our assistance

63
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:53,889
to the government, its logistics.

64
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,355
We have not sent combat troops there.

65
00:04:56,456 --> 00:05:00,122
You have a row of dominoes set up

66
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:02,323
and you knock over the first one

67
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:04,256
and the last one,
certainly it will go over.

68
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:06,523
If aggression is successful in Korea,

69
00:05:06,622 --> 00:05:09,090
we can expect it to spread
throughout Asia and Europe

70
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:10,389
and to this hemisphere.

71
00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:47,887
Viktor Frankl, who
survived the death camps

72
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:52,523
in World War II, wrote a book called
<i>Man's Search for Meaning.</i>

73
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:57,689
You know, "To live is to suffer.

74
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,256
To survive is to find
meaning in suffering."

75
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:06,790
And for those of us who
suffered because of Vietnam,

76
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:11,122
that's been our quest ever since.

77
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,523
America's involvement in
Vietnam began in secrecy.

78
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:33,523
It ended, 30 years later, in failure,

79
00:06:33,622 --> 00:06:36,855
witnessed by the entire world.

80
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:43,056
It was begun in good
faith by decent people

81
00:06:43,155 --> 00:06:45,723
out of fateful misunderstandings,

82
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:50,256
American overconfidence,
and Cold War miscalculation.

83
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:55,689
And it was prolonged because it
seemed easier to muddle through

84
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,822
than admit that it had been
caused by tragic decisions,

85
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:01,956
made by five American presidents,

86
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,889
belonging to both political parties.

87
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,790
Before the war was over,

88
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:12,555
more than 58,000
Americans would be dead.

89
00:07:12,655 --> 00:07:17,456
At least 250,000 South
Vietnamese troops died

90
00:07:17,555 --> 00:07:20,055
in the conflict, as well.

91
00:07:20,155 --> 00:07:24,090
So did over a million
North Vietnamese soldiers

92
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:25,655
and Viet Cong guerrillas.

93
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:34,090
Two million civilians, north and south,

94
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:36,056
are thought to have perished,

95
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:39,590
as well as tens of thousands
more in the neighboring states

96
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:41,490
of Laos and Cambodia.

97
00:07:44,155 --> 00:07:48,290
For many Vietnamese, it
was a brutal civil war;

98
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:51,756
for others, the bloody climactic chapter

99
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:55,355
in a century-old
struggle for independence.

100
00:08:00,622 --> 00:08:02,956
For those Americans who fought in it,

101
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:05,922
and for those who fought
against it back home,

102
00:08:06,023 --> 00:08:09,523
as well as for those who merely
glimpsed it on the nightly news,

103
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:13,323
the Vietnam War was a decade of agony,

104
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:18,922
the most divisive period
since the Civil War.

105
00:08:19,023 --> 00:08:23,889
Vietnam seemed to call
everything into question...

106
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,422
the value of honor and gallantry;

107
00:08:28,523 --> 00:08:33,056
the qualities of cruelty and mercy;

108
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:37,623
the candor of the American government;

109
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:41,490
and what it means to be a patriot.

110
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:50,155
And those who lived through it

111
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:53,155
have never been able
to erase its memory,

112
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:56,322
have never stopped arguing
about what really happened,

113
00:08:56,422 --> 00:09:01,990
why everything went so badly
wrong, who was to blame,

114
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,789
and whether it was all worth it.

115
00:10:41,822 --> 00:10:45,255
The French conquest of
Indochina began with an attack

116
00:10:45,355 --> 00:10:50,956
on the ancient Vietnamese
port of Danang in 1858.

117
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:54,490
It took 50 years to lay
claim to the whole region...

118
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:59,156
Laos and Cambodia, as well
as the 1,200-mile-long area

119
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:02,523
that would come to be called Vietnam.

120
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,289
All of it was ruled by
a French governor-general

121
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:10,690
from his palace in Hanoi.

122
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:15,722
The French largely lived
on plantation estates,

123
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:20,056
and in cities, like Saigon,
made to look as much as possible

124
00:11:20,156 --> 00:11:22,255
like those at home.

125
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,755
Most did not even bother
to learn the language

126
00:11:26,855 --> 00:11:28,789
spoken by their subjects.

127
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:32,523
Instead they installed a
series of puppet emperors

128
00:11:32,623 --> 00:11:34,190
and employed a network

129
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:38,090
of French-speaking Vietnamese
officials... mandarins...

130
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,255
willing to carry out their wishes.

131
00:11:43,655 --> 00:11:48,023
The French put their subjects to
work building roads and canals,

132
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,623
railroads and bridges.

133
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:09,623
The Vietnamese people
did not take easily

134
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:11,156
to French occupation,

135
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:14,023
just as they had fought
against earlier invasions

136
00:12:14,123 --> 00:12:15,722
by the Chinese.

137
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:19,922
By the early 20th century,
nationalism was on the rise.

138
00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:25,322
But anyone who dared resist
colonial rule risked exile,

139
00:12:25,422 --> 00:12:27,855
prison, or the guillotine.

140
00:13:21,755 --> 00:13:24,889
My hatred for them was pure.

141
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,822
Pure.

142
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:29,956
I hated them so much.

143
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:31,456
And I was so scared of them.

144
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:38,190
Boy, I was terrified of them.

145
00:13:46,755 --> 00:13:49,655
And the scareder I got,
the more I hated them.

146
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,822
I was an 18-year-old Marine
rifleman with the ink still wet

147
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:57,990
on my high school diploma.

148
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,523
I didn't want to shame
myself in front of my buddies.

149
00:14:02,656 --> 00:14:04,556
But I was so scared.

150
00:14:04,656 --> 00:14:07,456
I felt like I was hanging
onto my honor by my fingernails

151
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,190
the whole time I was there.

152
00:14:23,956 --> 00:14:26,090
In the spring of 1919,

153
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,289
as the victorious Allied
Powers met in Paris

154
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:33,090
to rebuild a world
shattered by the Great War,

155
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,889
President Woodrow Wilson
headed the American delegation

156
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,389
housed in the Hotel Crillon.

157
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:46,056
One day, a tall, slender,
29-nine-year-old man

158
00:14:46,155 --> 00:14:48,623
appeared with a petition
for the president

159
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:52,655
he and other Vietnamese
nationalists had written.

160
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:56,222
Inspired by Wilson's declaration

161
00:14:56,322 --> 00:14:59,190
that the interests of colonial
peoples should be given

162
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:02,556
equal weight with those
of their European rulers,

163
00:15:02,656 --> 00:15:07,956
the man was asking that this
principle be applied to his homeland.

164
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:12,909
The president's secretary
promised to show it to Wilson,

165
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:16,576
but there is no evidence
that he ever did.

166
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:19,176
His name was Nguyen Tat Thanh,

167
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:23,176
but he was now living under
an alias, Nguyen Ai Quoc...

168
00:15:23,276 --> 00:15:25,842
"Nguyen the Patriot."

169
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:29,310
During his long, shadowy career,

170
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:33,110
he would adopt some 70
different pseudonyms,

171
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,275
finally settling on "the
most enlightened one"...

172
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,710
Ho Chi Minh.

173
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,586
Ho Chi Minh was a man

174
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:45,009
who succeeded in projecting an image

175
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,110
of somebody who was
totally dedicated to freeing

176
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,576
his country and his people
from foreign domination

177
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:57,643
to the point that he
sacrificed his own well-being,

178
00:15:57,743 --> 00:16:01,676
his own life, not having
a family of his own.

179
00:16:03,076 --> 00:16:05,576
To Vietnamese, that's a big sacrifice

180
00:16:05,676 --> 00:16:08,409
because to us everybody needs a family.

181
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,110
Ho Chi Minh was born in 1890,

182
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,076
the son of a minor official
in the French regime.

183
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:19,076
After taking part in a demonstration

184
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:20,743
against the puppet emperor

185
00:16:20,842 --> 00:16:22,676
and the Frenchmen who
pulled his strings,

186
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:26,842
Ho was expelled from school
and marked for arrest.

187
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:34,243
He left Vietnam in 1911 and
remained in exile for 30 years.

188
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:39,009
He served as a cook's
helper aboard a French liner,

189
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,842
and visited New York and Boston,

190
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:47,009
where he worked for a time as a
pastry chef at the Parker House.

191
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,375
He shoveled snow in London,
tinted photographs in Paris.

192
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:58,042
There, Ho Chi Minh joined
the French Socialist Party.

193
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:01,610
But when he discovered the
anti-colonial writings of Lenin,

194
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,708
he became a communist.

195
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:07,142
He was invited to Moscow to study,

196
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:10,208
underwent training as a Soviet agent,

197
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,676
was sometimes criticized for
being a nationalist first,

198
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:15,610
a communist second,

199
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,642
and then was dispatched to China

200
00:17:18,743 --> 00:17:21,909
to organize a cell of
other Vietnamese exiles

201
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,575
and help establish the
Indochinese Communist Party.

202
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:30,310
Through it all, "He
was taut and quivering,"

203
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:33,642
a friend remembered,
"with only one thought...

204
00:17:33,743 --> 00:17:36,575
his country, Vietnam."

205
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:56,932
By 1940, much of the
world was at war again.

206
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:07,200
Germany had seized
most of Western Europe,

207
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,200
including France.

208
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,432
Imperial Japan threatened

209
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:16,565
many of the European colonies in Asia,

210
00:18:16,665 --> 00:18:20,499
and occupied Vietnam, where
they permitted their allies,

211
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,165
the collaborationist French,

212
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:24,966
to continue to oversee their colony.

213
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:31,632
To some Vietnamese, the
coming of the Japanese

214
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:36,266
seemed to signal a welcome
end to white colonial rule.

215
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,632
But Ho Chi Minh, still
in exile in China,

216
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:43,100
saw the Japanese as alien invaders,

217
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,632
no more welcome than the French.

218
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:48,966
They were only interested
in exploiting his country

219
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:54,732
and seizing Vietnamese crops
to fill their own rice bowls.

220
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,165
The time had come, he said,

221
00:18:57,266 --> 00:19:00,900
to rally "patriots of
all ages and all types,

222
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:05,065
peasants, workers,
merchants and soldiers"

223
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:08,865
to defeat the Japanese and
the collaborationist French.

224
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:18,165
In February of 1941, after three
decades away from his homeland,

225
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:22,299
Ho Chi Minh slipped back across
the Chinese border into Vietnam

226
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,665
and set up headquarters near
the remote village of Pac Bo

227
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,533
in a limestone cave at
the side of a mountain

228
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:32,333
he named for Karl Marx,

229
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:37,900
overlooking a jungle stream
he named for his hero, Lenin.

230
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:42,900
There, he founded a
revolutionary movement,

231
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:46,732
which he called the Vietnam
Independence League...

232
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,466
the Viet Minh.

233
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:05,299
To build and lead a fighting
force for his revolution,

234
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,033
Ho called upon Vo Nguyen Giap,

235
00:20:08,132 --> 00:20:10,533
a one-time teacher of French history

236
00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:14,299
who had instructed the
children of Hanoi's elite.

237
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,966
Giap was an early convert to communism,

238
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:21,432
whose life-long hatred
for the French intensified

239
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:24,833
when they beat his
wife to death in prison.

240
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:29,132
Inspired by Napoleon,
Lawrence of Arabia,

241
00:20:29,232 --> 00:20:32,799
and the communist Chinese
revolutionary Mao Zedong,

242
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,200
Giap had already begun to develop

243
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:39,565
a distinctive theory of warfare
that relied on guerrilla tactics

244
00:20:39,665 --> 00:20:44,665
until a full-scale conventional
attack could be mounted.

245
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:48,799
In the fight for independence
which he believed was coming,

246
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:55,565
his armies, Giap said, would
be "everywhere and nowhere."

247
00:20:56,265 --> 00:20:57,832
The reason Vietnamese

248
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,500
had always resort to guerrilla warfare

249
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,165
was because we were a small country.

250
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:07,499
And it was just a way of fight
the weak against the strong.

251
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,165
Don't fight unless
you're sure you can win,

252
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:14,600
and surprise is a big element.

253
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,966
Choose your own battle.

254
00:21:24,665 --> 00:21:28,833
I had about 26 guys that day out of 45.

255
00:21:28,932 --> 00:21:31,266
We were always somewhat understrength.

256
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:33,665
And this day we were
quite understrength.

257
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:37,200
My platoon's on point.

258
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:43,932
Go, go, go, go, go!

259
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:46,799
And all of a sudden the very point man,

260
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,365
the first guy in the column,
said, "VC on the trail.

261
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:51,732
VC on the trail."

262
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,232
Before I had a chance to digest this...

263
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,900
... he went down, shot
right through the chest.

264
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,966
And what was a very
well-laid ambush erupted.

265
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,469
I knew I'd lost a bunch of guys.

266
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,770
I said a prayer to
God saying, basically,

267
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,302
"If you need any more guys
from my platoon, take me.

268
00:22:25,402 --> 00:22:27,270
Don't take any more of my men."

269
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,735
As soon as I said it, I
freaked myself out and said,

270
00:22:30,835 --> 00:22:34,902
"Holy shit. Can I
take that prayer back?"

271
00:22:45,303 --> 00:22:48,736
By the spring of 1945,

272
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:54,170
more than three years after the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor,

273
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:57,402
the United States government
was looking for allies

274
00:22:57,503 --> 00:22:59,570
behind the lines in Vietnam.

275
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,769
The Americans were hoping to find a way

276
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:05,135
to undermine Japanese forces there

277
00:23:05,236 --> 00:23:08,402
when they were contacted by Ho Chi Minh.

278
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:10,303
And so it was decided to drop

279
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:15,402
an OSS team in to meet with
the Viet Minh leadership.

280
00:23:17,835 --> 00:23:21,070
Paul Hoagland was the medic on the team.

281
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,769
And the first thing he was
told was that he must attend

282
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,702
to their leader, who
was desperately sick.

283
00:23:26,803 --> 00:23:29,769
So he was taken to a grass shack

284
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,202
where a bewhiskered, skinny
man lay on a bundle of straw,

285
00:23:34,303 --> 00:23:35,835
desperately ill.

286
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,570
And that was Ho Chi Minh.

287
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:44,635
The OSS, the secret wartime
precursor of the CIA,

288
00:23:44,736 --> 00:23:47,902
supplied Ho's ragtag
guerrillas with arms

289
00:23:48,003 --> 00:23:52,803
and marveled at how quickly
they learned to handle them.

290
00:23:52,902 --> 00:23:55,602
Ho Chi Minh began to call his followers

291
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:59,902
the "Viet-American Army,"
and praised the United States

292
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:01,902
as a "champion of democracy"

293
00:24:02,003 --> 00:24:05,170
that would surely help
them end colonial rule.

294
00:24:23,436 --> 00:24:28,003
Meanwhile, famine gripped the
northern part of the country.

295
00:24:28,102 --> 00:24:30,003
Hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese

296
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:32,070
were dying of starvation

297
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,402
while Japanese storehouses
were filled with rice.

298
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:40,436
In those days, garbage was collected

299
00:24:40,535 --> 00:24:42,670
by people pushing carts.

300
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:47,370
And my mother remembers that
every morning she would see

301
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:49,370
these garbage carts going around

302
00:24:49,469 --> 00:24:53,436
and people picking up dead bodies
and throwing them on the cart.

303
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,070
It was incredible.

304
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:58,702
And people who lived through
it never, never forgot.

305
00:24:58,983 --> 00:25:03,449
Duong Van Mai's father
was the deputy governor

306
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,715
of a province east of Hanoi,

307
00:25:05,815 --> 00:25:08,250
the son and grandson of mandarins

308
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,983
who had all served the French.

309
00:25:11,082 --> 00:25:14,416
He and his wife had 17 children.

310
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:19,250
Parents who had children
who were, you know, plump,

311
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,782
were very afraid of their
children being stolen

312
00:25:21,882 --> 00:25:24,315
and killed.

313
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:27,515
And it was really like hell on earth.

314
00:25:27,616 --> 00:25:31,082
The government didn't
have a clue on how to deal

315
00:25:31,183 --> 00:25:33,282
with this calamity.

316
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,149
But Ho Chi Minh did.

317
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,483
He directed the Viet Minh

318
00:25:38,582 --> 00:25:41,850
to break into the Japanese
storehouses wherever they could

319
00:25:41,949 --> 00:25:46,082
and distribute the rice to the people.

320
00:25:46,183 --> 00:25:48,750
They were hailed as saviors.

321
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:06,782
When an atomic bomb destroyed Hiroshima,

322
00:26:06,882 --> 00:26:10,416
and three days later a
second one destroyed Nagasaki,

323
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:13,550
Japanese surrender seemed imminent.

324
00:26:15,582 --> 00:26:19,149
Ho Chi Minh called upon
all Vietnamese to rise up

325
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,183
and take over their own country

326
00:26:21,282 --> 00:26:23,649
before the Free French could reestablish

327
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,250
their old colonial regime.

328
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:31,449
They did, in cities and
towns across the country.

329
00:26:34,983 --> 00:26:37,882
On September 2, 1945,

330
00:26:37,983 --> 00:26:40,750
the same day the Japanese
formally surrendered,

331
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,750
hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese

332
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:48,649
streamed into Ba Dinh Square in
Hanoi to see for the first time

333
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,983
the mysterious leader of the Viet Minh

334
00:26:52,082 --> 00:26:56,715
and hear him proclaim
Vietnam's independence.

335
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:04,949
With an OSS officer standing nearby,

336
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:09,015
Ho Chi Minh began with the
words of Thomas Jefferson:

337
00:27:09,116 --> 00:27:11,649
"All men are created equal.

338
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,550
They are endowed by their creator

339
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:17,750
with certain unalienable rights;

340
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,515
that among these are life, liberty

341
00:27:20,616 --> 00:27:22,815
and the pursuit of happiness."

342
00:27:45,282 --> 00:27:47,582
Ho Chi Minh had great hopes

343
00:27:47,683 --> 00:27:53,050
that the U.S. would support the
Vietnam desire for independence,

344
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:54,916
not necessarily by intervening

345
00:27:55,015 --> 00:27:58,782
but by doing what it could

346
00:27:58,882 --> 00:28:02,515
to support an independence movement.

347
00:28:02,616 --> 00:28:06,315
Ho Chi Minh's hopes for
American support were calculated

348
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:09,315
but understandable.

349
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:13,315
President Franklin Roosevelt
had promised a postwar world

350
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:16,483
that would "respect the
rights of all peoples

351
00:28:16,582 --> 00:28:19,550
to choose the form of government
under which they live."

352
00:28:22,382 --> 00:28:26,215
But Roosevelt was dead now,
and his successor, Harry Truman,

353
00:28:26,315 --> 00:28:30,082
had inherited a very different world.

354
00:28:30,183 --> 00:28:32,515
The alliance with the Soviet Union

355
00:28:32,616 --> 00:28:36,416
that had won the Second
World War had collapsed.

356
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:40,149
The Soviets now occupied the
Eastern European countries

357
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,815
they had overrun, and hoped to
spread their influence farther,

358
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:49,616
into Iran, Turkey,
and the Mediterranean.

359
00:28:49,715 --> 00:28:54,015
A new cold war had begun.

360
00:28:54,116 --> 00:28:56,683
French president
Charles De Gaulle warned

361
00:28:56,782 --> 00:28:59,850
that if the United States
insisted on independence

362
00:28:59,949 --> 00:29:03,616
for her colonies, France
might have no choice

363
00:29:03,715 --> 00:29:07,050
but to "fall into the Russian orbit."

364
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:10,550
The United States must
do nothing to undercut

365
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:16,050
the restoration of France's
empire, including Vietnam.

366
00:29:20,116 --> 00:29:23,616
There were hardly any Americans
in Vietnam, you know...

367
00:29:23,715 --> 00:29:26,649
State Department people,
consular officials,

368
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,949
a few businessmen.

369
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,015
Hardly anyone from this country

370
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:32,882
knew where Vietnam was located.

371
00:29:32,983 --> 00:29:37,683
George Wickes was part
of a seven-man OSS mission

372
00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:41,116
sent to Saigon, the
largest city in the south.

373
00:29:41,215 --> 00:29:44,683
The United States was
officially neutral,

374
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:47,550
hoping the French and
Viet Minh could reach

375
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:51,183
some peaceful solution on their own.

376
00:29:51,282 --> 00:29:54,782
Allied leaders had agreed
temporarily to divide Vietnam

377
00:29:54,882 --> 00:29:57,350
into two separate zones.

378
00:29:57,449 --> 00:30:01,616
Nationalist Chinese troops were
to handle things in the north.

379
00:30:01,715 --> 00:30:05,183
British colonial troops would
try to perform the same task

380
00:30:05,282 --> 00:30:08,082
in the south, where rival factions,

381
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:12,282
including the French and Viet
Minh, were already fighting

382
00:30:12,382 --> 00:30:15,282
in the streets of Saigon.

383
00:30:15,382 --> 00:30:17,750
No one was in charge.

384
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:23,616
On both sides, there was brutality
and atrocity and violence.

385
00:30:23,715 --> 00:30:26,250
It wasn't quite a civil war

386
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,215
but it was getting
very close to civil war

387
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:30,550
in the streets of Saigon.

388
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:33,986
Lieutenant Colonel Peter Dewey,

389
00:30:34,085 --> 00:30:37,452
the 28-year-old commander
of the OSS in Saigon,

390
00:30:37,553 --> 00:30:40,152
tried to make sense of it all.

391
00:30:40,252 --> 00:30:42,986
Right from the start he was
in touch with everybody...

392
00:30:43,085 --> 00:30:45,819
not only the French, but
very soon he established

393
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,085
a connection with
various Vietnamese groups.

394
00:30:50,185 --> 00:30:53,185
The Viet Minh soon
established themselves

395
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:55,720
as the most successful.

396
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:58,620
Dewey, who spoke fluent French,

397
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,652
brokered talks between
a Viet Minh spokesman

398
00:31:01,752 --> 00:31:05,452
and the senior French
representative in the city.

399
00:31:05,553 --> 00:31:10,319
His efforts infuriated
British general Douglas Gracey,

400
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,353
who commanded Allied
forces in the south.

401
00:31:13,452 --> 00:31:16,319
Gracey was convinced that French control

402
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,252
should be reimposed as soon as possible.

403
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:22,685
By conferring with the
Viet Minh, Gracey said,

404
00:31:22,786 --> 00:31:27,252
Colonel Dewey had become
a "subversive" force.

405
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:32,286
The violence in and
around Saigon escalated.

406
00:31:34,286 --> 00:31:37,019
Colonel Dewey urgently
cabled his superiors:

407
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,620
Vietnam "is burning," he wrote.

408
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,220
"The French and British
are finished here

409
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,853
and the United States," he concluded,

410
00:31:45,952 --> 00:31:48,120
"ought to clear out of Southeast Asia."

411
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:56,885
Two days later, September 26, 1945,

412
00:31:56,986 --> 00:31:58,486
he set out for the airport,

413
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:03,486
prepared to fly to OSS headquarters.

414
00:32:03,585 --> 00:32:08,585
At a roadblock, the Viet Minh
mistook Dewey for a Frenchman

415
00:32:08,685 --> 00:32:10,720
and opened fire.

416
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:15,519
He was killed instantly.

417
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,720
Ho Chi Minh wrote to the United States

418
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:23,819
lamenting the death of
Dewey, whom he recognized

419
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,786
as a person sympathetic to his cause.

420
00:32:27,885 --> 00:32:30,619
It seemed a terrible irony that Dewey,

421
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,286
who was doing what he could to help

422
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:37,052
the Vietnamese independence
movement should have been killed

423
00:32:37,153 --> 00:32:39,420
by the Vietnamese by a mistake.

424
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,685
An elderly African-American
woman answered the door.

425
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,720
I think she knew the instant
she saw us why we were there.

426
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,819
And the padre said, uh,

427
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,520
"I'm... I'm terribly
sorry to inform you,

428
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:19,786
but your son was killed in Vietnam."

429
00:33:19,885 --> 00:33:20,819
And she just sat down.

430
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,552
Didn't say a word.

431
00:33:24,885 --> 00:33:28,619
Then the... her husband
says, "No, there's a mistake."

432
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,420
He comes back with this letter.

433
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,786
And he said, "Look, see?

434
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:37,786
We got it yesterday, my... our
son was still alive yesterday."

435
00:33:37,885 --> 00:33:40,853
And the chaplain looked at the letter

436
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:43,153
and he said, "It's a week old.

437
00:33:43,252 --> 00:33:47,685
I think your son was killed on
the day he wrote this letter."

438
00:33:55,485 --> 00:33:59,685
In the fall of 1945, a week
after Colonel Dewey's death,

439
00:33:59,786 --> 00:34:02,752
fresh French troops
began arriving in Saigon,

440
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:06,720
taking over from the British.

441
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:07,985
They quickly established

442
00:34:08,086 --> 00:34:09,885
control of the city

443
00:34:09,985 --> 00:34:11,286
and set out to reoccupy

444
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:13,186
the entire country.

445
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:18,820
Ho Chi Minh hoped somehow
to achieve independence

446
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,920
without a war with France,

447
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,420
and he still hoped the
United States would intervene.

448
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,420
"You never had an empire, never
exploited the Asian peoples,"

449
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,552
he would tell a visiting
American journalist.

450
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:35,719
"Do not be blinded by
this issue of communism."

451
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:41,152
He did not want to fight the
French as an enemy of America.

452
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:47,453
And, in fact, I saw the letters
he wrote to President Truman

453
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:51,986
saying, "We believe in the
same things you believe."

454
00:34:52,085 --> 00:34:55,352
Those letters I saw in the CIA files,

455
00:34:55,453 --> 00:34:59,319
they had never been
given to President Truman.

456
00:35:03,585 --> 00:35:08,185
In June of 1946, Ho Chi
Minh returned to Paris

457
00:35:08,285 --> 00:35:11,220
in a fruitless attempt to
get the French to live up

458
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:14,520
to a promise they had
made of increased autonomy

459
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,852
for his country.

460
00:35:16,953 --> 00:35:18,752
While Ho was away,

461
00:35:18,852 --> 00:35:22,220
General Giap began
consolidating communist control

462
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:23,685
of the revolution.

463
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:26,553
He conducted a merciless purge

464
00:35:26,652 --> 00:35:29,585
of members of rival nationalist parties

465
00:35:29,685 --> 00:35:32,953
and people he called
"reactionary saboteurs"...

466
00:35:33,053 --> 00:35:38,319
landlords and moneylenders,
Trotskyites and Catholics,

467
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:42,785
men and women accused of
collaborating with the French.

468
00:35:42,886 --> 00:35:47,220
Hundreds were shot,
drowned, buried alive.

469
00:36:00,352 --> 00:36:05,252
On December 19, 1946, after
months of building tension,

470
00:36:05,352 --> 00:36:07,553
fighting broke out in Hanoi

471
00:36:07,652 --> 00:36:10,553
between the Viet Minh and the French.

472
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:17,986
The Viet Minh proved no
match for French firepower.

473
00:36:22,553 --> 00:36:28,419
Ho, Giap, and their comrades
slipped out of the city

474
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,453
and returned to their mountain
stronghold far to the north.

475
00:36:34,685 --> 00:36:37,819
"Those who have rifles
will use their rifles,"

476
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:39,919
Ho declared in a radio address

477
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,852
calling for a nationwide guerrilla war.

478
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:46,819
"Those who have swords will use swords;

479
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:52,152
those who have no swords
will use spades or sticks."

480
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:24,372
But the country Ho
Chi Minh hoped to unite

481
00:37:24,472 --> 00:37:27,706
was itself bitterly divided.

482
00:37:27,805 --> 00:37:30,106
Families were being torn apart.

483
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:33,972
Despite her father's position
in the French government,

484
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:39,005
Duong Van Mai's sister felt
compelled to answer Ho's call.

485
00:37:40,673 --> 00:37:44,273
My older sister Thang was married

486
00:37:44,372 --> 00:37:49,405
to a man who had great
sympathy for the Viet Minh.

487
00:37:49,505 --> 00:37:52,505
And by that time Ho Chi Minh
had evacuated his government

488
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:53,905
to the mountain base.

489
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:57,639
So my sister and her
husband trekked all the way

490
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,972
from Hanoi toward the base

491
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:03,673
in order to join the
resistance against the French.

492
00:38:06,372 --> 00:38:08,840
So the Vietnam War
was really a civil war

493
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,572
down to the family level.

494
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:22,505
France poured thousands
of men into Vietnam...

495
00:38:22,606 --> 00:38:26,940
French regulars, European
mercenaries, and colonial troops

496
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,905
from Morocco, Algeria,
Tunisia, and Senegal...

497
00:38:31,005 --> 00:38:35,872
who fought alongside an
army of Cambodians, Laotians,

498
00:38:35,972 --> 00:38:38,872
and anti-communist Vietnamese.

499
00:38:42,706 --> 00:38:47,005
French forces managed to
occupy most of the large towns

500
00:38:47,106 --> 00:38:48,505
and province capitals

501
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:53,572
and established hundreds
of isolated outposts.

502
00:38:53,673 --> 00:38:58,340
The French also set out to try
to win over rural Vietnamese

503
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,805
through a program they
called <i>pacification...</i>

504
00:39:01,905 --> 00:39:04,005
pacification...

505
00:39:04,106 --> 00:39:08,740
building dikes, schools and
roads, and vaccinating children.

506
00:39:11,572 --> 00:39:13,972
The French would pacify a village

507
00:39:14,072 --> 00:39:18,240
and during the daytime
they could control it.

508
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,840
But at night the Viet
Minh would come back.

509
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,072
And so it was never completely secure.

510
00:39:26,173 --> 00:39:29,606
My father would shake his
head and said, you know,

511
00:39:29,706 --> 00:39:31,173
"Pacification is really futile

512
00:39:31,273 --> 00:39:35,505
because it's like trying to
hold sand in your fingers."

513
00:39:38,972 --> 00:39:44,072
The Viet Minh mined roads,
blew up bridges and railroads,

514
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:49,340
ambushed French patrols,
and then disappeared.

515
00:39:51,673 --> 00:39:55,872
French soldiers sometimes took
revenge on the nearest village,

516
00:39:55,972 --> 00:39:58,372
burning homes, raping women,

517
00:39:58,472 --> 00:40:02,673
executing men suspected
of aiding the Viet Minh.

518
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,575
But the communists proved

519
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:46,273
every bit as ruthless as the French.

520
00:40:46,372 --> 00:40:49,539
"It is better to kill even
those who might be innocent,"

521
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:55,372
one commander said, "than
to let a guilty person go."

522
00:40:55,472 --> 00:40:57,740
And they specifically targeted

523
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,106
anyone who had links to the French.

524
00:41:01,206 --> 00:41:04,300
Once my father started
working for the French,

525
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:07,673
then he was a target,
especially the higher he rose,

526
00:41:07,773 --> 00:41:09,639
the bigger target he became.

527
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:15,805
A Viet Minh agent actually came
in with a pistol to shoot him

528
00:41:15,905 --> 00:41:19,472
but at the last moment decided not to.

529
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,105
French casualties continued to mount.

530
00:42:02,205 --> 00:42:05,040
"There are days when
we are so discouraged

531
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,740
that we would like to give it all up,"

532
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,939
a French soldier wrote his mother.

533
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,205
"Convoys under attack, roads cut,

534
00:42:13,305 --> 00:42:16,406
"firing in all directions every night,

535
00:42:16,506 --> 00:42:18,439
the indifference at home."

536
00:42:28,105 --> 00:42:30,000
While I was there I had the opportunity

537
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:32,939
to call my mother, you know.

538
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,073
And I was telling my mother
what was happening over there,

539
00:42:36,172 --> 00:42:39,272
and I was telling her
how she shouldn't believe

540
00:42:39,372 --> 00:42:42,240
what she sees in the newspaper
and sees on television

541
00:42:42,339 --> 00:42:44,973
because we're losing the war.

542
00:42:45,073 --> 00:42:47,839
I said, "And you'll
probably never see me again

543
00:42:47,939 --> 00:42:50,612
because we're the most northern outpost

544
00:42:50,613 --> 00:42:52,939
that the Marines have, you know."

545
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,973
We could literally... could
look right into North Vietnam.

546
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,006
We could see the sparks
when the guns fired on us.

547
00:42:57,105 --> 00:42:59,272
And I said, "And everybody
in my unit is dying.

548
00:42:59,372 --> 00:43:02,040
I probably won't be coming back."

549
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,172
And my mother said,
"No, you're coming back."

550
00:43:04,272 --> 00:43:08,006
She said, "I talk to God
every day and you're special.

551
00:43:08,105 --> 00:43:09,939
You're coming back."

552
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,272
And I said, "Ma,
everybody's mother thinks

553
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:14,573
that they're special.

554
00:43:14,672 --> 00:43:18,705
You know, I'm putting pieces
of special people in bags."

555
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,772
President Truman's dramatic announcement

556
00:43:25,872 --> 00:43:27,305
that Russia had the atom secret

557
00:43:27,406 --> 00:43:31,740
caused state departments all
over the world to stir uneasily.

558
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:36,172
We were very aware that
there was a Cold War

559
00:43:36,273 --> 00:43:38,139
and that we had an enemy,

560
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:42,273
and that enemy was the Soviet Union.

561
00:43:42,373 --> 00:43:45,440
The United States stood at one pole

562
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,739
and the Soviet Union
stood at the other pole.

563
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,806
It was kind of a Manichean dynamic

564
00:43:50,905 --> 00:43:52,672
that there was evil and there was good.

565
00:43:52,773 --> 00:43:54,706
And we were good, and
the other side was evil.

566
00:43:54,806 --> 00:43:57,873
It wasn't morally ambiguous.

567
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:04,905
Just a few weeks after
Russia became a nuclear power,

568
00:44:05,005 --> 00:44:06,840
there was more stunning news...

569
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:13,239
communist forces under Mao
Zedong seized control of China.

570
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:17,206
Separate communist
insurrections were also underway

571
00:44:17,306 --> 00:44:22,840
in the British colonies
of Burma and Malaya.

572
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,605
In January 1950, Mao formally recognized

573
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:30,739
Ho Chi Minh's insurgency and
agreed to provide the arms,

574
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,739
equipment, and military
training he had been seeking.

575
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,840
The Soviets recognized
the Viet Minh as well,

576
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,739
and also offered help.

577
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,405
President Truman, who was being blamed

578
00:44:44,505 --> 00:44:48,340
by his political opponents
for having "lost" China,

579
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,773
and having failed to
"contain" communism,

580
00:44:50,873 --> 00:44:54,306
approved a $23 million aid program

581
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:57,139
for the French in Vietnam.

582
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:02,072
The United States was no longer neutral.

583
00:45:02,172 --> 00:45:05,005
We were caught on the horns of a dilemma

584
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:07,739
of how can we maintain our friendship

585
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,572
and our alliance with the French
and support them in Indochina

586
00:45:11,672 --> 00:45:15,306
while we, as a former colony ourselves,

587
00:45:15,405 --> 00:45:18,373
sympathized with the
Vietnamese and their aspirations

588
00:45:18,472 --> 00:45:20,405
for freedom and independence?

589
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:27,572
A highly trained and
well-equipped North Korean Army

590
00:45:27,672 --> 00:45:29,806
swarmed across the 38th parallel

591
00:45:29,905 --> 00:45:31,873
to attack unprepared
South Korean defenders.

592
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:37,273
In June of 1950, China's ally,

593
00:45:37,373 --> 00:45:40,873
communist North Korea,
invaded South Korea.

594
00:45:42,505 --> 00:45:44,405
President Truman ordered

595
00:45:44,505 --> 00:45:46,773
tens of thousands of
American ground troops

596
00:45:46,873 --> 00:45:48,739
onto the Korean Peninsula.

597
00:45:55,706 --> 00:45:57,605
The United States and its allies

598
00:45:57,706 --> 00:46:02,072
eventually pushed the
invaders back north.

599
00:46:02,172 --> 00:46:04,472
Meanwhile in southern China,

600
00:46:04,572 --> 00:46:06,940
Mao's military was beginning
to turn the Viet Minh

601
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,840
into a modern fighting force,

602
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:15,005
capable of inflicting a heavy
toll on the French occupiers.

603
00:46:22,373 --> 00:46:24,139
In July, the Truman administration

604
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:27,105
quietly dispatched transport planes

605
00:46:27,206 --> 00:46:29,773
and a shipload of jeeps to Vietnam.

606
00:46:29,873 --> 00:46:35,540
Thirty-five military advisors
went along to oversee their use.

607
00:46:37,373 --> 00:46:40,273
None of them, and no one
in the American embassy,

608
00:46:40,373 --> 00:46:44,373
spoke a word of Vietnamese.

609
00:46:44,472 --> 00:46:48,773
But the United States was
now officially in Vietnam.

610
00:46:51,005 --> 00:46:53,172
In October of 1950,

611
00:46:53,273 --> 00:46:56,340
hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops

612
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,605
began pouring into North Korea,

613
00:46:58,706 --> 00:47:02,739
driving the allies
back down the peninsula.

614
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,472
As that fighting raged,

615
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,773
Truman continued to
increase military aid

616
00:47:07,873 --> 00:47:10,672
for the French war in Vietnam.

617
00:47:13,905 --> 00:47:15,840
If aggression is successful in Korea,

618
00:47:15,939 --> 00:47:19,173
we can expect it to spread
throughout Asia and Europe

619
00:47:19,272 --> 00:47:20,506
and to this hemisphere.

620
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,606
We are fighting in Korea

621
00:47:25,705 --> 00:47:28,305
for our own national
security and survival.

622
00:47:35,073 --> 00:47:37,173
In the autumn of 1951,

623
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:39,405
a young Massachusetts congressman

624
00:47:39,506 --> 00:47:43,372
named John F. Kennedy
dined at the rooftop bar

625
00:47:43,472 --> 00:47:46,106
of the Hotel Majestic
overlooking Saigon.

626
00:47:47,506 --> 00:47:49,506
As he and his party ate,

627
00:47:49,606 --> 00:47:53,939
they could hear the thunder of
guns across the Saigon River.

628
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:57,073
French commanders assured Kennedy

629
00:47:57,173 --> 00:47:59,673
that with more American support,

630
00:47:59,772 --> 00:48:02,939
French rule would be re-established.

631
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:06,606
But Kennedy spent two
hours with Seymour Topping,

632
00:48:06,705 --> 00:48:08,805
a seasoned American reporter,

633
00:48:08,905 --> 00:48:11,506
who gave him a very
different perspective:

634
00:48:11,606 --> 00:48:14,305
the French were losing, he said,

635
00:48:14,405 --> 00:48:18,173
and many Vietnamese, who had
once admired the Americans,

636
00:48:18,272 --> 00:48:22,405
were beginning to despise
them for backing the French.

637
00:48:22,506 --> 00:48:25,740
Kennedy believed the reporter.

638
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,106
Unless the United States
could persuade the Vietnamese

639
00:48:29,205 --> 00:48:32,772
that it was as opposed to
"injustice and inequality"

640
00:48:32,872 --> 00:48:34,372
as it was to communism,

641
00:48:34,472 --> 00:48:37,439
he told his constituents
when he got home,

642
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:42,805
the current effort would
result in "foredoomed failure."

643
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,205
In 1952,

644
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,573
General Dwight Eisenhower
was elected president,

645
00:48:56,673 --> 00:48:59,472
in part because he promised
to take a tougher stance

646
00:48:59,573 --> 00:49:01,606
on communism.

647
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:05,006
That year, American taxpayers

648
00:49:05,106 --> 00:49:07,539
were footing more than 30% of the bill

649
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,573
for the French war in Vietnam.

650
00:49:10,673 --> 00:49:12,772
Within two years,

651
00:49:12,872 --> 00:49:16,205
that number would rise to nearly 80%.

652
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,905
And many of you ask this question:

653
00:49:22,006 --> 00:49:24,272
Why is the United States spending

654
00:49:24,372 --> 00:49:26,173
hundreds of millions of dollars

655
00:49:26,272 --> 00:49:30,372
supporting the forces
of the French Union

656
00:49:30,472 --> 00:49:33,972
in the fight against
communism in Indochina?

657
00:49:34,073 --> 00:49:36,305
I think perhaps if we
go over to the map here,

658
00:49:36,405 --> 00:49:40,740
I can indicate to you why
it is so vitally important.

659
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,173
Here's Indochina.

660
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,606
If Indochina falls,

661
00:49:44,705 --> 00:49:47,939
Thailand is put in almost
impossible position.

662
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:51,106
The same is true of Malaya
with its rubber and tin.

663
00:49:51,205 --> 00:49:56,240
Now may I say that as far as the
war in Indochina is concerned,

664
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:00,905
that I was there, right on the
battlefield, or close to it,

665
00:50:01,006 --> 00:50:03,606
and it's a bloody war,
and it's a bitter one.

666
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:13,740
By 1953, the French had been
fighting for seven years.

667
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,073
They had suffered
over 100,000 casualties

668
00:50:17,173 --> 00:50:20,305
and failed to pacify the countryside.

669
00:50:20,405 --> 00:50:24,073
Six commanders had come and gone.

670
00:50:24,173 --> 00:50:26,340
Nevertheless, the seventh commander,

671
00:50:26,439 --> 00:50:29,472
General Henri Navarre,
assured his countrymen

672
00:50:29,573 --> 00:50:31,006
that victory was near.

673
00:50:31,106 --> 00:50:34,140
"Now we can see it clearly," he said,

674
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,073
"like the light at
the end of the tunnel."

675
00:50:40,073 --> 00:50:43,972
Meanwhile, large parts of the
French population were horrified

676
00:50:44,073 --> 00:50:46,673
by reports of French brutality

677
00:50:46,772 --> 00:50:49,472
and the widespread use of napalm...

678
00:50:49,573 --> 00:50:54,240
gelatinized petroleum
that burned foliage,

679
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,805
homes, and human flesh.

680
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:03,140
When returning French troops
disembarked at Marseilles,

681
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,606
members of the longshoremen's
union pelted them with rocks.

682
00:51:07,705 --> 00:51:10,772
Parisian leftists began
to call the conflict

683
00:51:10,872 --> 00:51:14,006
"La Sale Guerre"... "The Dirty War."

684
00:51:22,452 --> 00:51:24,753
The camera was a close-up,

685
00:51:24,852 --> 00:51:27,920
was over the shoulder
of this storm trooper

686
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:31,552
who had a kid by the scruff
of his shirt and he smacks him.

687
00:51:31,653 --> 00:51:32,753
People screaming...

688
00:51:32,852 --> 00:51:34,920
At that moment in time,

689
00:51:35,019 --> 00:51:37,619
I realized that anybody
who really cared for America

690
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,186
was sent halfway around the world

691
00:51:39,285 --> 00:51:42,686
chasing some ghost in a jungle.

692
00:51:42,785 --> 00:51:45,820
In the meantime, my
country's being torn apart.

693
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,119
So I saw somebody who looked like my dad

694
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,720
hitting somebody who looked like me.

695
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,653
Whose side would I be on?

696
00:51:59,753 --> 00:52:02,253
In Korea, three years of combat end

697
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:06,352
as United Nations and communist
negotiators at Panmunjom sign a truce.

698
00:52:06,512 --> 00:52:09,480
In July of 1953,

699
00:52:09,579 --> 00:52:12,945
the Korean War ended in
a negotiated settlement

700
00:52:13,045 --> 00:52:14,980
and a still-divided peninsula.

701
00:52:15,154 --> 00:52:18,455
American policymakers saw it as proof

702
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:21,855
that communism in Asia
could be contained.

703
00:52:21,955 --> 00:52:23,687
And in Washington, a dramatic
evening press conference...

704
00:52:23,788 --> 00:52:26,821
That fall, the French
indicated their willingness

705
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,888
to begin talks to end
the fighting in Vietnam.

706
00:52:30,987 --> 00:52:34,420
Ho Chi Minh agreed to meet.

707
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:38,388
But before the negotiators
were to convene in Geneva,

708
00:52:38,487 --> 00:52:43,487
each side sought to improve
its position on the battlefield.

709
00:52:45,087 --> 00:52:47,654
General Navarre set up a fortified base

710
00:52:47,754 --> 00:52:50,620
in a remote valley in
northwestern Vietnam

711
00:52:50,721 --> 00:52:55,187
called Dien Bien Phu, where
he hoped to lure the Viet Minh

712
00:52:55,288 --> 00:52:57,288
into a decisive battle.

713
00:52:59,388 --> 00:53:02,587
Navarre was certain that
superior French firepower

714
00:53:02,687 --> 00:53:07,687
and air support would crush
any attack by the Viet Minh.

715
00:53:07,788 --> 00:53:10,355
He and his commanders
saw no need to worry

716
00:53:10,455 --> 00:53:14,888
about the jungle-covered hills
that overlooked his 11,000 men,

717
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:17,888
dug in on the valley floor.

718
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:22,221
The artillery commander
was so confident of victory,

719
00:53:22,321 --> 00:53:26,355
he complained, "I have
more guns than I need."

720
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:32,055
General Giap saw his chance.

721
00:53:32,154 --> 00:53:36,620
"We decided to wipe out at
all costs the whole enemy force

722
00:53:36,721 --> 00:53:39,654
at Dien Bien Phu," he remembered.

723
00:53:41,721 --> 00:53:45,387
To do it, he pulled off one of
the greatest logistical feats

724
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,487
in military history...

725
00:53:47,587 --> 00:53:50,687
a feat that would be
restaged in propaganda films

726
00:53:50,788 --> 00:53:53,987
and celebrated for decades.

727
00:53:54,087 --> 00:53:57,955
A quarter of a million
civilian porters...

728
00:53:58,055 --> 00:53:59,388
nearly half of them women...

729
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:04,288
moved everything he needed
for a siege, from sacks of rice

730
00:54:04,388 --> 00:54:06,555
to disassembled artillery pieces,

731
00:54:06,654 --> 00:54:09,687
on foot through the jungle.

732
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:14,555
Giap surrounded the
valley with 50,000 soldiers

733
00:54:14,654 --> 00:54:19,788
and 200 big guns, dug-in
and camouflaged so well

734
00:54:19,888 --> 00:54:24,455
they could not be spotted from the air.

735
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:30,347
On March 13, 1954,

736
00:54:30,447 --> 00:54:32,681
Viet Minh artillery on the hillsides

737
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:36,047
began raining down 50 shells a minute

738
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:39,114
on the French troops huddled below.

739
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,215
The airstrip was destroyed.

740
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,347
The besieged troops
could only be reinforced

741
00:54:49,447 --> 00:54:52,280
and resupplied by airdrop.

742
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,581
The French artillery commander,

743
00:54:57,681 --> 00:55:02,648
who had underestimated his
enemy, committed suicide.

744
00:55:02,828 --> 00:55:05,828
The airlift to Dien
Bien Phu continues...

745
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:08,360
vital men and supplies
for the heroic garrison

746
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,194
that has defied the massed Viet
Minh onslaughts for over six weeks.

747
00:55:11,295 --> 00:55:14,295
Today, Dien Bien Phu is a human dam

748
00:55:14,395 --> 00:55:16,295
trying to stem the red tide

749
00:55:16,395 --> 00:55:18,495
that threatens to engulf Southeast Asia.

750
00:55:20,161 --> 00:55:21,104
The French government

751
00:55:21,105 --> 00:55:24,495
begged President
Eisenhower to intervene.

752
00:55:24,594 --> 00:55:27,895
He refused to act without
Congressional approval

753
00:55:27,995 --> 00:55:30,860
and support from European allies.

754
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,995
Britain said no

755
00:55:33,094 --> 00:55:36,860
and the Congress would not
support unilateral action.

756
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,228
The communists

757
00:55:38,328 --> 00:55:40,895
under Ho Chi Minh are able to
claim that they are fighting

758
00:55:40,995 --> 00:55:43,527
for independence and the
French appear to be fighting

759
00:55:43,627 --> 00:55:45,895
for a maintain...
maintenance of colonial rule.

760
00:55:45,995 --> 00:55:47,328
I therefore believe

761
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:50,627
that before the United States
moves in, in any degree,

762
00:55:50,728 --> 00:55:53,261
that independence must
be granted to the people,

763
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,027
that the people must
support the struggle.

764
00:55:56,828 --> 00:56:00,761
"I am convinced," Eisenhower
confided to his diary,

765
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:05,694
"that no military victory
is possible in this theater."

766
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:08,427
Still, without consulting Congress,

767
00:56:08,527 --> 00:56:12,360
the president had secretly sent
more American transport planes,

768
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:18,127
their markings painted over and
flown by civilian contractors,

769
00:56:18,228 --> 00:56:22,795
to help resupply the desperate
French troops at Dien Bien Phu.

770
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,728
Everyone understood
that in and of itself,

771
00:56:28,828 --> 00:56:32,360
Vietnam didn't mean very much.

772
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:36,594
But they believed, I
believed, if we lost it,

773
00:56:36,694 --> 00:56:39,527
that the rest of Asia
would tumble to communism.

774
00:56:39,677 --> 00:56:44,477
You have broader
considerations that might follow

775
00:56:44,577 --> 00:56:49,345
what you would call the
falling domino principle.

776
00:56:49,445 --> 00:56:51,977
You have a row of dominoes set up,

777
00:56:52,077 --> 00:56:53,845
and you knock over the first one,

778
00:56:53,945 --> 00:56:57,811
and what will happen to the
last one is the certainty

779
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:00,811
that it will go over very quickly.

780
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:28,045
On the afternoon of May 7,
1954, after 55 days of siege,

781
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:33,278
the exhausted French forces
at Dien Bien Phu surrendered.

782
00:57:35,878 --> 00:57:40,610
They had lost 8,000 men,
killed, wounded, or missing.

783
00:57:43,477 --> 00:57:47,845
General Giap had lost
three times as many,

784
00:57:47,945 --> 00:57:51,077
but he had won a great victory.

785
00:58:08,211 --> 00:58:13,077
Even Duong Van Mai's parents
could not help but be impressed.

786
00:58:13,177 --> 00:58:15,211
They were very proud

787
00:58:15,311 --> 00:58:17,945
that the Viet Minh had
defeated the French,

788
00:58:18,045 --> 00:58:19,945
this great Western power.

789
00:58:20,045 --> 00:58:23,878
Admiration and respect on the one hand,

790
00:58:23,977 --> 00:58:26,211
but fear on the other hand.

791
00:58:26,311 --> 00:58:29,010
And fear was the stronger emotion.

792
00:58:30,711 --> 00:58:33,378
"We have been caught
bluffing by our enemies,"

793
00:58:33,477 --> 00:58:37,177
Senate Minority Leader
Lyndon Johnson said.

794
00:58:37,278 --> 00:58:42,278
"Today it is Indochina,
tomorrow Asia may be in flames.

795
00:58:42,378 --> 00:58:48,477
And the day after, the Western
Alliance will lie in ruins."

796
00:58:48,577 --> 00:58:51,545
We should have seen it as
the end of the colonial era

797
00:58:51,644 --> 00:58:54,744
in Southeast Asia, which it really was.

798
00:58:54,845 --> 00:58:57,211
But instead we saw it in Cold War terms,

799
00:58:57,311 --> 00:59:01,977
and we saw it as a
defeat for the free world

800
00:59:02,077 --> 00:59:03,845
that was related to the rise of China.

801
00:59:03,945 --> 00:59:08,945
And it was a total
misreading of a pivotal event,

802
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,644
which cost us very dearly.

803
00:59:17,677 --> 00:59:19,644
The former home of
the League of Nations,

804
00:59:19,744 --> 00:59:21,910
Geneva, Switzerland,
where East is meeting West

805
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,311
in the international conference

806
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:27,878
that may decisively affect
the political future of Asia.

807
00:59:27,977 --> 00:59:31,244
The day after the fall of Dien Bien Phu,

808
00:59:31,345 --> 00:59:35,010
diplomats from nine
nations gathered in Geneva

809
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:37,878
to settle the future of Vietnam.

810
00:59:37,977 --> 00:59:42,010
The talks dragged on for
nearly two-and-a-half months.

811
00:59:45,045 --> 00:59:46,811
Despite their victory,

812
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:50,577
Ho Chi Minh and General
Giap could not keep fighting

813
00:59:50,677 --> 00:59:55,811
without more support from
China and the Soviet Union.

814
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:59,311
But China had lost a
million men in Korea

815
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:02,378
and did not want to become
involved in another war

816
01:00:02,477 --> 01:00:04,045
along its border.

817
01:00:04,144 --> 01:00:09,878
The Soviet Union was hoping
to ease tensions with the West.

818
01:00:09,977 --> 01:00:14,845
Both of Ho Chi Minh's communist
patrons urged him to agree

819
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,811
to a negotiated settlement,

820
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:21,211
a partition like the one
that had ended the Korean War.

821
01:00:21,311 --> 01:00:24,644
Ho had no option but to give in.

822
01:00:28,577 --> 01:00:31,345
In the end, no one was satisfied.

823
01:00:33,378 --> 01:00:38,345
Vietnam was temporarily to be
divided at the 17th parallel.

824
01:00:38,445 --> 01:00:42,878
The 130,000 French-led
troops stationed in the North

825
01:00:42,977 --> 01:00:45,045
were to withdraw to the South,

826
01:00:45,144 --> 01:00:49,045
and somewhere between
50,000 and 90,000 Viet Minh

827
01:00:49,144 --> 01:00:51,811
were to "re-group" to the North.

828
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:53,677
The two halves would be separated

829
01:00:53,778 --> 01:00:58,077
by a demilitarized zone until
an election could be held

830
01:00:58,177 --> 01:01:01,378
to reunify North and South Vietnam,

831
01:01:01,477 --> 01:01:06,610
an election everyone knew
Ho Chi Minh would win.

832
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:42,544
We had started walking up

833
01:01:42,644 --> 01:01:44,510
and we had probably gotten about
a third of the way up the hill

834
01:01:44,611 --> 01:01:46,111
and then they unleashed on us.

835
01:01:48,977 --> 01:01:51,111
We were in the middle of
this horrible shit sandwich.

836
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:53,211
That's what we called it.

837
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:02,178
One of the things that I
learned in the war is that

838
01:02:02,278 --> 01:02:05,877
we're not the top species on
the planet because we're nice.

839
01:02:08,745 --> 01:02:11,877
People talk a lot about how well
the military turns, you know,

840
01:02:11,977 --> 01:02:14,678
kids into, you know,
killing machines and stuff.

841
01:02:14,778 --> 01:02:17,278
And I'll always argue that
it's just finishing school.

842
01:02:25,945 --> 01:02:27,211
Braving the dangers

843
01:02:27,212 --> 01:02:29,611
of the open sea in tiny, rickety craft,

844
01:02:29,711 --> 01:02:32,111
thousands of Roman
Catholic and Buddhist faith

845
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:34,477
have found life impossible
under the communists.

846
01:02:34,577 --> 01:02:38,044
For them, it's freedom or nothing.

847
01:02:41,211 --> 01:02:43,178
Under the Geneva Accords,

848
01:02:43,278 --> 01:02:46,111
civilians living in
either half of Vietnam

849
01:02:46,211 --> 01:02:48,445
who wanted to relocate to the other

850
01:02:48,544 --> 01:02:51,544
would have 300 days to do so.

851
01:02:51,644 --> 01:02:55,544
My mother and father wanted to stay

852
01:02:55,644 --> 01:02:57,644
and meet my sister Thang again

853
01:02:57,745 --> 01:03:00,077
because they knew Thang would come back.

854
01:03:00,178 --> 01:03:02,410
But on the other hand
they couldn't risk that.

855
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:07,377
They were convinced that when
Ho Chi Minh and his government

856
01:03:07,477 --> 01:03:09,611
arrived in Hanoi,

857
01:03:09,711 --> 01:03:13,245
my father would be the
first one to be killed

858
01:03:13,345 --> 01:03:15,211
and all of us would be persecuted.

859
01:03:17,945 --> 01:03:19,977
And I remember the day we left.

860
01:03:20,077 --> 01:03:23,345
I looked around and I thought,
"I never come back here again."

861
01:03:25,711 --> 01:03:27,611
It was extremely traumatic.

862
01:03:27,711 --> 01:03:32,310
It was like the ground was
suddenly cut from under you.

863
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:37,877
In the end, some 900,000 refugees,

864
01:03:37,977 --> 01:03:41,577
including more than half of all
the Catholics living in the North,

865
01:03:41,678 --> 01:03:46,845
fled to the South, many of
them aboard American ships.

866
01:03:51,211 --> 01:03:54,778
The United States hoped somehow
to encourage the building

867
01:03:54,877 --> 01:03:57,111
of a legitimate government in the South.

868
01:03:59,245 --> 01:04:03,945
That government was now
headed by Ngo Dinh Diem.

869
01:04:04,044 --> 01:04:06,711
Both a Roman Catholic and a Confucian

870
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:08,910
in a largely Buddhist country,

871
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:13,910
he was a celibate bachelor who
had once planned to be a priest.

872
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:20,211
The war for us really started
when we became the partner,

873
01:04:20,311 --> 01:04:25,345
or I would say the
victim, of President Diem.

874
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:30,378
We were going to help him turn
South Vietnam into a democracy.

875
01:04:30,477 --> 01:04:31,977
That's what he said he wanted to do.

876
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:33,045
And we believed him.

877
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:35,477
Like Ho Chi Minh,

878
01:04:35,577 --> 01:04:39,144
Diem had spent years
abroad seeking support

879
01:04:39,244 --> 01:04:42,910
for his own brand of
Vietnamese nationalism.

880
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:46,410
He was a veteran politician
whose loathing for the French

881
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:50,278
was matched only by his
hatred for the communists,

882
01:04:50,378 --> 01:04:54,045
who had imprisoned him and
buried alive his eldest brother

883
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:56,510
and his nephew.

884
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:59,945
Diem was aloof, autocratic,

885
01:05:00,045 --> 01:05:03,311
mistrustful of anyone
much beyond his own family.

886
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:07,311
He also proved to be
shrewd, resourceful,

887
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:11,445
and skilled at exploiting the
weaknesses of his opponents.

888
01:05:11,545 --> 01:05:17,477
But he faced a daunting task
in creating a new country.

889
01:05:17,577 --> 01:05:20,577
The French, who still
had thousands of troops

890
01:05:20,677 --> 01:05:24,144
stationed in the South, detested Diem.

891
01:05:24,244 --> 01:05:28,010
Several provinces were under
the sway of religious sects

892
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:30,477
with armies of their own.

893
01:05:30,577 --> 01:05:34,677
Tens of thousands of Viet
Minh soldiers had gone north,

894
01:05:34,778 --> 01:05:36,878
but several thousand cadre...

895
01:05:36,977 --> 01:05:40,311
trained and dedicated
Communist Party workers...

896
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:46,345
had stayed behind to organize
resistance in the countryside.

897
01:05:46,445 --> 01:05:50,510
And Saigon itself was
ruled by the Binh Xuyen,

898
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:54,010
a crime syndicate backed by the French.

899
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:56,311
And the French were
behind the Binh Xuyen,

900
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:57,811
sort of supporting them

901
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:00,977
because they didn't
want Diem to succeed.

902
01:06:01,077 --> 01:06:03,010
And that became the central contest.

903
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:07,055
Some in the CIA believed

904
01:06:07,056 --> 01:06:11,010
that Diem could be the
savior of South Vietnam.

905
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:13,045
Others were not so sure.

906
01:06:13,144 --> 01:06:15,278
"He is a messiah without a message,"

907
01:06:15,378 --> 01:06:18,311
one diplomat reported to Washington.

908
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:21,878
The U.S. ambassador agreed.

909
01:06:21,977 --> 01:06:25,278
On April 27, 1955,

910
01:06:25,378 --> 01:06:27,700
President Eisenhower decided

911
01:06:27,701 --> 01:06:32,110
to end American support
for Diem's regime.

912
01:06:33,278 --> 01:06:36,477
But then Diem made an all-out assault

913
01:06:36,577 --> 01:06:38,878
on the Binh Xuyen syndicate.

914
01:06:41,278 --> 01:06:43,077
Suddenly in the middle of the day

915
01:06:43,177 --> 01:06:47,677
we heard gunfire and then we saw flames

916
01:06:47,778 --> 01:06:50,110
and the neighborhood was burning.

917
01:06:50,211 --> 01:06:52,395
There are hundreds of dead and wounded

918
01:06:52,396 --> 01:06:56,010
on both sides as the street fighting
continues for an entire week.

919
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:59,345
For the United States, the
situation presents a grave problem.

920
01:07:01,278 --> 01:07:04,244
Diem finally regains control of Saigon.

921
01:07:05,977 --> 01:07:10,244
In the end, Diem's forces prevailed.

922
01:07:10,345 --> 01:07:16,211
Eisenhower now saw no option
but to stick with Diem.

923
01:07:16,311 --> 01:07:21,677
The French then announced their
intention to withdraw completely

924
01:07:21,778 --> 01:07:27,910
from South Vietnam, ending
nearly a century of occupation.

925
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:33,077
Diem became wildly popular
because he seemed to embody

926
01:07:33,177 --> 01:07:35,677
the nationalist cause in the South.

927
01:07:35,777 --> 01:07:37,677
He succeeded in getting the French

928
01:07:37,777 --> 01:07:39,710
out of Vietnam all the way.

929
01:07:39,811 --> 01:07:43,277
And Ho Chi Minh had only got
them out of the northern half.

930
01:07:43,378 --> 01:07:45,633
Flush with victory,

931
01:07:45,634 --> 01:07:48,634
Diem called for a
referendum in the South.

932
01:07:49,277 --> 01:07:54,677
The CIA warned him not to
meddle too much with the returns.

933
01:07:55,878 --> 01:07:57,677
But when the ballots were counted,

934
01:07:57,777 --> 01:08:03,545
Diem claimed to have
won 98.2% of the vote.

935
01:08:05,445 --> 01:08:10,978
On October 26, 1955, Ngo
Dinh Diem named himself

936
01:08:11,077 --> 01:08:16,710
the first president of the
brand-new Republic of Vietnam.

937
01:08:16,811 --> 01:08:20,611
The election to reunify
the North and South

938
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:24,277
that had been promised at
Geneva would never be held.

939
01:08:26,378 --> 01:08:30,410
He became our ally,
or rather our master,

940
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:33,010
because the goal of preventing

941
01:08:33,111 --> 01:08:35,210
the communists from
taking over the South

942
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:41,844
was so strong that we couldn't
afford for him to lose.

943
01:08:41,945 --> 01:08:44,678
So Diem started to boss us around.

944
01:08:44,777 --> 01:08:46,777
And this was a typical relationship.

945
01:08:46,878 --> 01:08:49,245
You need any ally you believe

946
01:08:49,344 --> 01:08:52,277
to be the centerpiece
of your foreign policy.

947
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:53,878
They understand that right away.

948
01:08:53,977 --> 01:08:56,645
And the tail wags the dog.

949
01:09:00,811 --> 01:09:03,378
From the Far East comes
a distinguished visitor.

950
01:09:03,477 --> 01:09:06,145
President Ngo Dinh Diem
of Vietnam is accorded

951
01:09:06,245 --> 01:09:09,178
one of President Eisenhower's
rare airport greetings,

952
01:09:09,277 --> 01:09:11,678
as he arrives for a
four-day state visit.

953
01:09:11,777 --> 01:09:15,510
President Diem, one of America's
staunchest allies in Southeast Asia,

954
01:09:15,611 --> 01:09:18,245
will seek an increase in
aid to shore up his country

955
01:09:18,344 --> 01:09:20,145
against increasing communist pressure,

956
01:09:20,245 --> 01:09:25,710
a request to which the president
lends a sympathetic ear.

957
01:09:25,811 --> 01:09:29,745
Most politicians, Democrats
as well as Republicans,

958
01:09:29,844 --> 01:09:31,745
now seemed to share the changing views

959
01:09:31,844 --> 01:09:33,678
of Senator John F. Kennedy.

960
01:09:33,777 --> 01:09:37,344
South Vietnam is "our
offspring," he said.

961
01:09:37,445 --> 01:09:39,044
"We cannot abandon it."

962
01:09:39,145 --> 01:09:43,410
If it fell, the United States
would be "held responsible

963
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:47,811
and our prestige in Asia
will sink to a new low."

964
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:53,245
There had never before been
a South Vietnamese nation,

965
01:09:53,344 --> 01:09:56,577
but Americans, who had rebuilt
much of their own country

966
01:09:56,678 --> 01:10:00,277
during the New Deal and had
helped rebuild Western Europe

967
01:10:00,378 --> 01:10:01,611
through the Marshall Plan,

968
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:06,378
were convinced they could
build one nonetheless.

969
01:10:08,544 --> 01:10:12,445
Eisenhower ordered scores
of American civilians

970
01:10:12,544 --> 01:10:16,245
to South Vietnam, full of
plans for economic development

971
01:10:16,344 --> 01:10:20,077
meant to win, he hoped,
the hearts and minds

972
01:10:20,178 --> 01:10:21,878
of the Vietnamese people.

973
01:10:24,844 --> 01:10:27,945
But those civilians would
always be outnumbered

974
01:10:28,044 --> 01:10:29,544
by military advisors,

975
01:10:29,645 --> 01:10:34,044
with orders to modernize,
train, and equip Diem's forces,

976
01:10:34,145 --> 01:10:39,910
now called the Army of the
Republic of Vietnam... the ARVN.

977
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:45,445
Some ARVN officers found
American methods unsuited

978
01:10:45,544 --> 01:10:48,178
to the guerrilla war
they expected to wage

979
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:50,410
against the communists.

980
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:53,178
Most American military
advisors were veterans

981
01:10:53,277 --> 01:10:54,577
of the war in Korea,

982
01:10:54,678 --> 01:10:58,344
determined to prepare
South Vietnamese forces

983
01:10:58,445 --> 01:11:03,878
to slow a conventional
invasion from the North.

984
01:11:03,977 --> 01:11:07,577
But no one in North Vietnam

985
01:11:07,678 --> 01:11:11,210
was planning a conventional invasion.

986
01:11:11,311 --> 01:11:15,210
Ho Chi Minh was focused
on rebuilding his country,

987
01:11:15,311 --> 01:11:19,178
devastated by more than a decade of war.

988
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:25,245
The communists imposed
brutal land reforms

989
01:11:25,344 --> 01:11:27,510
modeled on those underway in China

990
01:11:27,611 --> 01:11:32,277
with a ruthlessness that
left thousands of people dead,

991
01:11:32,378 --> 01:11:35,745
including not only landlords
who had sided with the French,

992
01:11:35,844 --> 01:11:40,111
but also many villagers who
had fought with the Viet Minh.

993
01:11:42,777 --> 01:11:46,510
Ho Chi Minh was still
determined to reunite Vietnam.

994
01:11:46,611 --> 01:11:50,811
But he worried that if he took direct
military action against the South,

995
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:54,977
the United States would be drawn
more deeply into the struggle.

996
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:58,510
He cautioned his comrades in
the South to put their faith

997
01:11:58,611 --> 01:12:02,378
in political agitation
and avoid violence.

998
01:12:04,811 --> 01:12:06,777
But that message rang hollow

999
01:12:06,878 --> 01:12:11,445
among embattled Southern
revolutionaries struggling to survive

1000
01:12:11,544 --> 01:12:16,445
under Diem's increasingly harsh regime.

1001
01:12:16,544 --> 01:12:21,077
In a campaign he called
"Denounce the Communists,"

1002
01:12:21,178 --> 01:12:24,477
Diem had imprisoned tens
of thousands of citizens

1003
01:12:24,577 --> 01:12:30,710
without trial and ordered the
executions of hundreds more.

1004
01:12:30,811 --> 01:12:34,710
Now, the communists took
matters into their own hands

1005
01:12:34,811 --> 01:12:38,477
and began attacking South
Vietnamese officials.

1006
01:13:18,178 --> 01:13:22,245
As violence in South
Vietnam intensified,

1007
01:13:22,344 --> 01:13:24,977
new leaders emerged in Hanoi.

1008
01:13:25,077 --> 01:13:28,445
Ho Chi Minh would remain
the face of the revolution

1009
01:13:28,544 --> 01:13:32,410
around the world, but he
now began to share power

1010
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:35,678
with men who were growing
impatient with his caution,

1011
01:13:35,777 --> 01:13:40,311
men about whom Americans
knew almost nothing.

1012
01:13:42,445 --> 01:13:45,378
The most important proved
to be a carpenter's son

1013
01:13:45,477 --> 01:13:51,577
from Quang Tri province
in the South named Le Duan.

1014
01:13:51,678 --> 01:13:55,145
He had helped found the
Indochinese Communist Party,

1015
01:13:55,245 --> 01:13:58,710
survived nearly ten
years in a French prison,

1016
01:13:58,811 --> 01:14:01,910
and proved himself a
shrewd political infighter

1017
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:05,445
as he rose to become First
Secretary of the party.

1018
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:44,277
By 1959, Le Duan and his hardline allies

1019
01:14:44,378 --> 01:14:48,311
were gaining influence within
the North Vietnamese Politburo

1020
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:51,010
and beginning to change its policy.

1021
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:54,878
They now argued that
Hanoi should do everything

1022
01:14:54,977 --> 01:14:58,077
within its power to help
Southern revolutionaries

1023
01:14:58,178 --> 01:15:00,477
remove Diem by force.

1024
01:15:22,111 --> 01:15:25,645
Now, bands of 40 to 50 armed Viet Minh

1025
01:15:25,745 --> 01:15:29,044
began slipping back
home into South Vietnam,

1026
01:15:29,145 --> 01:15:32,910
following jungle paths hacked
through the Laotian mountains

1027
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:37,510
that the Americans would soon
call the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

1028
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:46,710
Violence against the Diem
regime steadily accelerated.

1029
01:15:56,645 --> 01:16:01,777
On the evening of July
8, 1959, at Bien Hoa,

1030
01:16:01,878 --> 01:16:03,710
20 miles northeast of Saigon,

1031
01:16:03,811 --> 01:16:07,945
six American military
advisors were watching a movie

1032
01:16:08,044 --> 01:16:09,577
in their mess hall.

1033
01:16:11,277 --> 01:16:13,311
Viet Minh guerrillas,
who had crept silently

1034
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:16,977
into the compound, opened
fire through the windows.

1035
01:16:22,645 --> 01:16:25,544
Major Dale Buis from Pender, Nebraska,

1036
01:16:25,645 --> 01:16:27,745
and Master Sergeant Chester Ovnand

1037
01:16:27,844 --> 01:16:31,245
from Copperas Cove, Texas, were killed.

1038
01:16:33,445 --> 01:16:37,745
They were the first American
soldiers to die from enemy fire

1039
01:16:37,844 --> 01:16:39,745
in the Vietnam War.

1040
01:16:41,397 --> 01:16:43,964
We must prove all over again,

1041
01:16:44,065 --> 01:16:49,798
to a watching world, as we sit
on a most conspicuous stage,

1042
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,498
whether this nation,

1043
01:16:51,597 --> 01:16:55,697
conceived as it is with
its freedom of choice,

1044
01:16:55,798 --> 01:17:00,365
its breadth of opportunity,
its range of alternatives,

1045
01:17:00,464 --> 01:17:02,830
can compete with the
single-minded advance

1046
01:17:02,931 --> 01:17:04,597
of the communist system.

1047
01:17:04,897 --> 01:17:10,530
On November 8, 1960, John
Fitzgerald Kennedy was elected

1048
01:17:10,631 --> 01:17:13,265
president of the United States.

1049
01:17:13,364 --> 01:17:17,097
His vice president was
Senator Lyndon Johnson.

1050
01:17:17,198 --> 01:17:21,164
They had narrowly beaten
Vice President Richard Nixon

1051
01:17:21,265 --> 01:17:24,498
and his running mate,
Senator Henry Cabot Lodge.

1052
01:17:25,965 --> 01:17:28,897
During the campaign,
both Kennedy and Nixon

1053
01:17:28,998 --> 01:17:33,431
had pledged to hold the line
against international communism

1054
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:36,131
wherever it seemed to be a threat.

1055
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:40,131
But very few Americans
knew or cared about

1056
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:42,565
what was going on in Vietnam.

1057
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,680
Six weeks after Kennedy's election,

1058
01:17:46,781 --> 01:17:49,747
at a remote jungle
village called Tan Lap

1059
01:17:49,848 --> 01:17:51,680
near the Cambodian border,

1060
01:17:51,781 --> 01:17:55,615
representatives of southern
revolutionary groups

1061
01:17:55,715 --> 01:17:59,814
met to form a new organization
to replace the Viet Minh,

1062
01:17:59,915 --> 01:18:02,781
dedicated to overthrowing Ngo Dinh Diem

1063
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,781
and ousting the
foreigners supporting him.

1064
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:12,380
Behind the scenes, Le Duan and
his communist comrades in Hanoi

1065
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:16,480
were orchestrating everything.

1066
01:18:16,581 --> 01:18:18,281
The new organization would be called

1067
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:22,615
the National Liberation
Front... the NLF.

1068
01:18:24,215 --> 01:18:27,281
The armed wing of the NLF was called

1069
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:30,047
the People's Liberation Armed Forces,

1070
01:18:30,148 --> 01:18:33,581
but its enemies in Saigon
and Washington preferred

1071
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,715
a more disparaging term.

1072
01:18:35,814 --> 01:18:39,180
In their eyes, the revolutionaries were

1073
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:42,680
Communist Traitors to
the Vietnamese Nation...

1074
01:18:42,781 --> 01:18:44,281
the Viet Cong.

1075
01:19:34,715 --> 01:19:37,114
Let every nation know,

1076
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:42,814
whether it wishes us well or ill,

1077
01:19:42,915 --> 01:19:48,948
that we shall pay any
price, bear any burden,

1078
01:19:49,047 --> 01:19:53,915
meet any hardship, support any friend,

1079
01:19:54,015 --> 01:19:59,015
oppose any foe, to assure the survival

1080
01:19:59,114 --> 01:20:00,480
and the success of liberty.

1081
01:20:12,847 --> 01:20:15,314
For me, I'd always thought of courage

1082
01:20:15,415 --> 01:20:19,915
as charging enemy bunkers
or standing up under fire.

1083
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:25,948
But just to walk, day after
day from village to village

1084
01:20:26,047 --> 01:20:30,581
and through the paddies
and up into the mountains,

1085
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:34,847
just to get up in the morning
and look out at the land

1086
01:20:34,948 --> 01:20:38,547
and think, "In a few minutes
I'll be walking out there

1087
01:20:38,648 --> 01:20:41,780
and will my corpse be there, over there?

1088
01:20:41,881 --> 01:20:43,314
Will I lose a leg out there?"

1089
01:20:45,114 --> 01:20:48,881
Just to walk felt incredibly brave.

1090
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:51,747
I would sometimes look
at my legs as I walked,

1091
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,247
thinking, how am I doing this?
