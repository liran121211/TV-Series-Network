Burns starts a fracking operation and Lisa calls in Assemblywoman Maxine Lombard to stop him though the two fall in love and the greedy occupants of Evergreen Terrace are persuaded to sell the rights to dig under their houses. Only Marge holds out, causing a rift with Homer whilst Burns dumps Maxine , who retaliates by trying to demolish his mansion to make way for liberal institutions. An enraged Burns orders Homer to commence fracking - but Marge, as ever, makes him see sense.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3603776", "rating": 6.3, "votes": 1241, "number_of_episodes": 848}
