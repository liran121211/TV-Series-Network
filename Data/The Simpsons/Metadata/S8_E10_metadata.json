Needless to say, nobody takes him seriously, except for \"X-Files\" FBI Agent Fox Mulder, who once again drags along his partner Dana Scully on another quest to prove the government is hiding the presence of UFO's from the public. However, even this mission may make a skeptic out of Mulder.\u2014Daniel Timothy Dey", "One eerie Friday night, while walking home from Moe's through the woods, Homer sees an alien who claims to bring love. Homer panics and runs home. The next day at breakfast, no-one in the family believes him. As a matter of fact, no-one else in Springfield does, either, not even Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, until Homer and Bart manage to capture it on camera the next Friday night. They send it to to Channel 6 news, and it becomes an immediate sensation. Another week later, the entire town turns out to try to see the alien (although some people are there just to prove Homer wrong, judging by how much faster the \"Homer is a Dope\" t-shirts sold out than the \"Homer was Right\" t-shirts). Finally, the alien appears, but is it what it seems?\u2014Andy L."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0701263", "rating": 9.1, "votes": 5205, "number_of_episodes": 848}
