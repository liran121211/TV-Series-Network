Having read an Aramaic rune Bart finds himself transported to Hell, where his deviousness makes him the star pupil and he graduates with honour having tortured Homer half to death. 'A Clockwork Yellow' is a brilliant Clockwork Orange parody in which Moe recalls his days leading his gang the Drugs until they were forced to become respectable though they end up by killing the guests at an 'Eyes Wide Shut' party. 'The Others' finds the family haunted by the ghosts of the earlier cartoon incarnation of themselves. Eventually the current family kill themselves with Homer choosing which of the two Marges he prefers before assorted versions of the family turn up at the door.\u2014don @ minifie-1", "Bart goes to a new school that's in Hell.
