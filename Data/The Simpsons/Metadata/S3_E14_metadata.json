When a 1-900 football hotline and other resources don't work out, a desperate Homer asks Lisa for whom she thinks will win the next game. Lisa's pick turns out to be right, and Homer invites her to spend time with her on the next Sunday. Lisa's prognostic skills help Homer win a fortune from Moe in a clandestine betting pool (which Moe runs under Chief Wiggum's nose), but soon \"Daddy-Daughter Day\" may come to an end with Super Bowl Sunday, especially when Homer thoughtlessly plans a bowling outing with Barney on the Sunday after the Super Bowl. Lisa is crushed (and Marge outraged) to learn that Homer only created \"Daddy-Daughter Day\" to help him gamble, and a remorseful Homer tries to beg Lisa for forgiveness any way he can. Lisa makes the prediction that if Washington were to win the Super Bowl, she'd still love him; if Buffalo wins, Lisa will forever hate her day. Homer mopes all the way throughout the Super Bowl, but then Washington stages a late comeback to win. With her love secured, Homer decides to make good on a promise to go hiking with Lisa on the next Sunday.\u2014Brian Rathjen <briguy_527323@yahoo.com>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0768557", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 3792, "number_of_episodes": 848}
