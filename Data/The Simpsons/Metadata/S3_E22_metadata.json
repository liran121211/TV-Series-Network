When he finds he is (at best) marginally talented, he seeks advice from Otto. Otto decides to demonstrate his guitar skills, but forgets that he needs to take his busload of students to school. In the ensuing chaos, he drives recklessly and causes a rollover accident in front of the school. Although nobody is hurt, Principal Skinner finds out that Otto is unlicensed and fires him; Skinner takes over the job, but is a little too overcautious (unlike his predecessor). Meanwhile, the now jobless Otto is soon evicted from his apartment and forced to move in with the Simpsons. Otto just wants to lay around the house and play guitar, which irritates Homer, but Otto's attitude gets worse when he is unable to pass his driver's exam, despite several tries. When Homer confronts Otto about his laziness, Otto declares that he plans to staple his new license to Homer's head once he passes the test ... which - thanks to license examiners Patty and Selma, who have learned about Homer's ill feelings for Otto - is exactly what happens when they finally decide to go easy on Otto. It isn't long before Otto is back on the job.\u2014Brian Rathjen <briguy_52732@yahoo.com>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0701254", "rating": 7.6, "votes": 3686, "number_of_episodes": 848}
