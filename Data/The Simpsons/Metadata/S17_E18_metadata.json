In Lisa's version of the 'Mayflower' widow Marge, sailing to the New World with her children, is courted by dissidents Moe and Homer whilst Bart's take on 'Mutiny on the Bounty' features a tyrannical Captain Bligh, who looks like Seymour Skiner, cast adrift by his school boy crew. Finally Homer's 'The Neptune Adventure' tells of a liner overturned on New Year's Eve, with the Simpsons amongst the survivors. When they finally surface they encounter the ghost of the Bounty.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0795278", "rating": 6.7, "votes": 1616, "number_of_episodes": 848}
