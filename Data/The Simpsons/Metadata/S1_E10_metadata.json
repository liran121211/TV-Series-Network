While at the party, Homer is invited to dance on stage with a stripper. Bart (who is dining with the rest of the family in the next-door restaurant) uses his camera to snap a photo of Homer and the dancer having a great time. At school, Martin develops the picture, which - after he compliments Bart's work - gets distributed around school, and eventually around town. Marge sees the photo and is outraged. Homer arrives home, where Marge immediately confronts her husband and kicks him out of the house. Eventually, Marge agrees to let him back in on the condition he take Bart around to meet the stripper and show that she is not a sex object. After almost winding up on stage at another of the dancer's performances, Homer does as he is asked and all is forgiven.\u2014Brian Rathjen <briguy_52732@yahoo.com>", "Bart takes a picture of Homer dancing with Princess Kashmir, a belly dancer. The photo is then copied all over Springfield, and when Marge sees it, she (at first) thinks that Homer is having an affair. Homer explains the photo, but a still-angry Marge kicks him out of the house and demands that Homer introduce Bart to Princess Kashmir in person to show him that women are not sex objects."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0701123", "rating": 7.3, "votes": 4990, "number_of_episodes": 848}
