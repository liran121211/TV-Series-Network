There, he gains control of the airwaves and demands that all television stations immediately go off the air permanently ... or else he'll detonate an atomic bomb. When the authorities are unable to find Bob, they decide to err on the side of safety and give into his demands. However, Krusty the Clown uses an emergency transmitter to begin broadcasting from a civil defense shed. Bob is angered and detonates the bomb, which turns out to be a dud. With both moves having failed, Bob kidnaps Bart and steals a Wright Brothers-era plane to crash into the civil defense shed where Krusty is holed up inside. However, the antique plane is mechanically unable to carry out its intended suicide mission, and once the plane stalls, Bob is easily arrested.\u2014Brian Rathjen <briguy_52732@yahoo.com>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0701208", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 3179, "number_of_episodes": 848}
