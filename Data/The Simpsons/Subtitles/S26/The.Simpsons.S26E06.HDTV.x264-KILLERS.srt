to the Springfield time capsule,

17
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:46,467
where your arcana
will lie dormant

18
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:48,502
until the 31st century.

19
00:00:49,638 --> 00:00:51,605
And...

20
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,774
By the time you finish talking,
we're gonna be

21
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:55,375
opening this
damn capsule.

22
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:57,711
Right. Time capsule.
Nelson, give me something.

23
00:00:57,746 --> 00:00:59,646
I brought a picture of my dad.

24
00:00:59,682 --> 00:01:01,148
He's still at large...

25
00:01:01,183 --> 00:01:03,450
in my heart!

26
00:01:03,486 --> 00:01:05,586
I brought
my lucky rabbit's foot.

27
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:08,021
I can have good luck
without it.

28
00:01:08,057 --> 00:01:09,656
Ow!

29
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:12,493
Wish we could put<i> this</i> moment
in the time capsule.

30
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:14,328
Consider it done.

31
00:01:17,199 --> 00:01:19,166
Uh, how about you, Bart?

32
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:21,668
Let me guess-- you forgot
to bring something.

33
00:01:21,704 --> 00:01:25,472
I'm offended you think I forgot.

34
00:01:25,508 --> 00:01:26,508
Let's see.

35
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:27,941
Ta-da!

36
00:01:27,977 --> 00:01:29,943
Listen, boy, this
is the only legacy

37
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:31,445
you'll ever leave.

38
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,147
Better make this count.

39
00:01:34,984 --> 00:01:36,850
My sandwich!

40
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:42,289
And so a thousand years from now
this capsule will be opened

41
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:44,625
by some future Mayor Quimby.

42
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:54,001
That-that could be
<i>anyone's</i> ooze.

43
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:05,045
There.

44
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,382
And now,
to help secure the jazz vote,

45
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:11,685
Lisa Simpson will
play her saxophone.

46
00:02:15,858 --> 00:02:17,991
Even God hates jazz.

47
00:02:19,228 --> 00:02:21,628
A mysterious electrical storm

48
00:02:21,664 --> 00:02:23,397
is currently wreaking havoc
with our studio.

49
00:02:23,432 --> 00:02:25,732

What the hell was that?
Probably just another piece

54
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:44,218
of America's space junk
falling out of orbit.

55
00:02:44,253 --> 00:02:46,086
Remember when this country
didn't suck?

00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:47,354
'Cause I don't.

57
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,234
Homer, I think there's
someone downstairs.

58
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:01,902
Relax, Marge.

59
00:03:01,937 --> 00:03:05,138
It's probably just Homer
coming home late from Moe's.

60
00:03:05,174 --> 00:03:06,440
Hmm.

61
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,913
Ooh, the eyes in that picture
are following me!

62
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:15,382
Uh, that's a mirror.

63
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:18,752
Isn't<i> all</i> great art
kind of a mirror?

64
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:24,057
We'd better send the dog down.

65
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:26,727
Come on, here's your chance
to protect us, boy.

66
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:27,961
Come on. C...

67
00:03:27,997 --> 00:03:29,529
Aah!

68
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:31,331
Stupid dog.

69
00:03:33,936 --> 00:03:34,936
Ow!

70
00:03:36,138 --> 00:03:38,138
Ow.

71
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:42,209
We'll have to set
a trap, Bait--

72
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:43,577
I mean, Bart.

73
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,653
All set.

74
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:56,757
When he starts gnawing at you,
I'll whack him with this broom.

75
00:04:00,262 --> 00:04:01,895
Hmm.

76
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,964
Ooh!

77
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:06,099
Don't drink
my loved ones!

78
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:08,835
Oh! Bite my shiny metal ass!

79
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:10,937
A robot!
With a catchphrase!

80
00:04:10,973 --> 00:04:13,006
Hey, Homer, you gonna kiss him
or kill him?

81
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:16,476
All right!
Tether-boy!

82
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:26,453
Okay, so,
what are you?

83
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:28,455
Must be a secret
government project.

84
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,657
Whoa, what do
I look like, a narc?

85
00:04:30,693 --> 00:04:34,294
My name is Bender,
and I come from...

86
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,196
the future!

87
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:39,199
Prove it. What happens to
Homer Simpson in the future?

88
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:41,268
I don't know.
You die?

89
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:43,704
Oh... my... God.

90
00:04:43,739 --> 00:04:45,672
He's telling the truth.

91
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,742
I have to take you
to our civic leaders.

92
00:04:52,214 --> 00:04:54,781
Hey, hibachi head,
how are you gonna pay for that?

93
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:57,150

Hey,
this blade rummy is all right.

101
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:13,834
He's a big spender,
plus he fixed the jukebox.

102
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:16,169
I think
they had a thing going.

103
00:05:16,205 --> 00:05:18,405
♪ Oh, baby,
what you done to me... ♪

104
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:22,175
I hate it when
they get quiet.

105
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:24,378
Listen, uh, I know
you're a robot

106
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:26,380
and incapable
of emotion...

107
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:28,515
It's true.

108
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,484
I'm empty inside!

109
00:05:32,254 --> 00:05:35,088
Uh, look, I just want to
ask, can we be friends?

110
00:05:35,124 --> 00:05:38,191
You're the only guy I know
with less hair than me.

111
00:05:38,227 --> 00:05:40,494
Sure. That's why
I came to your time--

112
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:42,195
for all<i> you</i> know.

113
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:44,431
For all we know!

114
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,042
D'oh!

115
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,513
A, uh, strike!

116
00:05:59,548 --> 00:06:01,581
A totally legitimate strike!

117
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:04,284
Yeah!

118
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,120
Hey, uh, what's the robot
version of bro-Mance?

119
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:08,688
Ro-Mance.

120
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:12,959
You future guys have a word
for everything... pal.

121
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:17,297
You know, they look
a little similar.

122
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:19,599
Yeah. Like the guy
who designed Bender

123
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:21,568
just took a
drawing of Dad

124
00:06:21,603 --> 00:06:23,570
and stuck an antenna on it.

125
00:06:23,605 --> 00:06:25,405
A little lazy,

126
00:06:25,441 --> 00:06:27,441
if you ask me.

127
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:29,476
Regardless, I see
no reason to believe

128
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:31,478
that Bender is
from the future.

129
00:06:31,513 --> 00:06:34,815
Robotic technology today
is very advanced.

130
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,483
Oh,<i> really?</i>

131
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:39,786
Can your modern-day robots
do<i> this?</i>

132
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,459
It's not my birthday--

133
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:47,494
although Maggie's
is pretty soon.

134
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:48,895
I can't do "Maggie."

135
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:50,697
The Gs look like sixes.

136
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:55,335
This is the robot who claims
to be from the future.

137
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,072
Can your present-day robots
do<i> this?</i>

138
00:07:03,946 --> 00:07:05,479
Uh, no, no,
they cannot.

139
00:07:05,514 --> 00:07:07,113
Not sure why they'd
<i>want</i> to-- gorbid.

140
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:09,149
Now, why are
you here?

141
00:07:09,184 --> 00:07:11,651
What is your mission,
uh, so to speak?

142
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:13,453
I don't remember.

143
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:15,188
Man, this guy doesn't
ask permission--

144
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:16,790
he just goes
right in you.

145
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:18,792
Eh... aha!

146
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:21,628
Bender's mission protocol
is definitely intact.

147
00:07:21,663 --> 00:07:24,364
It just requires
a delicate procedure

148
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,933
known as "unplug and re-plug."

149
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:31,471
Because that fixes everything.

150
00:07:31,507 --> 00:07:34,875
I remember why I'm here!

151
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,377
To kill Homer Simpson!

152
00:07:37,412 --> 00:07:40,180
My ears are burning.

153
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:42,849
Not yet, but they will be.

154
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:45,585
A boxing glove!

155
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:51,239
But we bowled together.

156
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,676
Aw, I can't do it.

157
00:07:54,712 --> 00:07:57,479
What stopped you, Bender,
Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics?

158
00:07:57,514 --> 00:07:59,081
You think robots care

159
00:07:59,116 --> 00:08:01,149
what some hack
science fiction writer thinks?

160
00:08:01,185 --> 00:08:03,585
I killed Isaac Asimov
on the way over here.

161
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:05,821
Well, Isaac somebody.

162
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:08,423
What the...? My ass
is about to project something.

163
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:10,759
You don't have
to announce it.

164
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:14,196
Just do it quietly
and blame the dog.

165
00:08:14,231 --> 00:08:15,497
Bender,

166
00:08:15,532 --> 00:08:17,099
we've just regained contact.

167
00:08:17,134 --> 00:08:18,600
Have you killed Homer Simpson?

168
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:19,701
Uh, yep.

169
00:08:19,737 --> 00:08:20,769
Killed him good.

170
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:21,903
If Homer's dead,

171
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:23,538
why are the creatures he begat

172
00:08:23,574 --> 00:08:26,575
still here
and multiplying out of control?

173
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,379
What the...?

174
00:08:30,414 --> 00:08:32,514
You lied to
me, Bender!

175
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,583
Homer Simpson's
still alive!

176
00:08:34,618 --> 00:08:36,752
Come on, Bender,
stabbity-stabbity.

177
00:08:36,787 --> 00:08:39,921
Wait! Stop! Why must
you kill my dad?

178
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:43,792
Especially when cheeseburgers
are doing the work for you.

179
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:47,362
Homer Simpson must be
eliminated immediately.

180
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:50,932
The creatures destroying
New New York have his DNA.

181
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,605
The monsters are stealing
our office supplies!

182
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,407
That's inexcusable!

183
00:08:58,442 --> 00:08:59,908
Gah!

184
00:08:59,943 --> 00:09:01,209
Um...

185
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:02,778
Hello, robot.

186
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:05,947
Looks like<i> everyone</i> gets
a turn to say something.

187
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:07,949
This concludes my turn.

188
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:10,886
We sent Bender back in time
to kill Homer

189
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:13,255
before the monsters
could evolve from him.

190
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,825
Apparently, this was too heartless
a task for a robot.

191
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,827
Leela, can you handle it?

192
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:22,030
In a New New York minute minute.

193
00:09:24,134 --> 00:09:25,167
Ow!

194
00:09:30,107 --> 00:09:31,239
Ow!

195
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:32,774
Right in my language center!

196
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,080
Professor, y-you're
a fellow man of science.

197
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:39,848
Maybe if we teamed up,

198
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:42,017
we could, uh,
figure something out.

199
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:46,688
Okay. Eh, but remember, to
me you're incredibly stupid.

200
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:49,524
Oh, and the annoying
girl may be helpful.

201
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,994
Meanwhile, Leela, take Homer
and explore this time period.

202
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,299
Find out why people would
ever pay for "freemium games."

203
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:58,533
I'll explain.

204
00:09:58,569 --> 00:10:01,203
Okay, it<i> starts</i> free,
right?

205
00:10:01,238 --> 00:10:03,271
<i>Then</i> you visit
your friend's game,

206
00:10:03,307 --> 00:10:05,607
and he's got this awesome candy
mansion...

207
00:10:05,642 --> 00:10:08,877
Get a load
of those freaks!

208
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:10,679
And you're like, "99 cents?!

209
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:12,681
You bet I'd like one!"

210
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,386
And that's why I owe

211
00:10:18,422 --> 00:10:20,856
Clash of Candies $20,000.

212
00:10:20,891 --> 00:10:22,357
Here we are.

213
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:26,128
Marge, I'd like you
to meet Leela and Fry.

214
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:28,897
<i>Oh, don't mention her eye.</i>
<i>Don't mention her eye.</i>

215
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:31,052
<i>Don't mention her hair.</i>
<i>Don't mention her hair.</i>

216
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:33,568
I... am so pleased
to meet you.

217
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:35,203
Nice to be hair.

218
00:10:36,507 --> 00:10:38,673
Oh, Lord.

219
00:10:41,178 --> 00:10:42,544
Professor Farnsworth,

220
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:44,212
I'm dying to know
how you got here.

221
00:10:44,248 --> 00:10:46,648
Was it a time machine?
Little girl,

222
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:49,317
time machines are
physical impossibilities.

223
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:51,419
We teleported
through a singularity

224
00:10:51,455 --> 00:10:53,355
that I quantum entangled
to Bender

225
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,924
under the guise
of fixing his collar.

226
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:57,926
Yes, but how
did Bender get here?

227
00:10:57,961 --> 00:11:00,028
With a time machine.
But you just said that...

228
00:11:00,063 --> 00:11:01,530
Sample's ready!

229
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,699
Kill all humans.

230
00:11:04,735 --> 00:11:07,169
Kill all humans.

231
00:11:08,872 --> 00:11:10,172
Start with Flanders.

232
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:12,741
Start with Flanders.

233
00:11:12,776 --> 00:11:15,076
Good news, everyone!

234
00:11:15,112 --> 00:11:16,545
That means it's bad.

235
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,346
The human DNA
in the creatures

236
00:11:18,382 --> 00:11:19,848
was only
half Homer's.

237
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:21,716
The other half came from...

238
00:11:21,752 --> 00:11:23,552
someone else.

239
00:11:23,587 --> 00:11:25,787
Oh, so we can kill
that person instead.

240
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,556
Maybe they're evil
and deserve it.

241
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:29,891
Or have one of those
annoying<i> voices</i>

242
00:11:29,927 --> 00:11:31,593
that gets on everybody's nerves,

243
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:34,296
with the adding extra
noises for no reason.

244
00:11:34,331 --> 00:11:35,797
Myveen.

245
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,899
Bloingy.

246
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:39,935
And the other person is...

247
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,806
Oh, who's that?

248
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:46,808
It's me.

249
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:49,211
Wait a minute. We don't
have to kill you.

250
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:50,912
Oh, well, that's better.

251
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:53,281
We just have to kill
all your children.

252
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:55,283
Or just one of them.

253
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:58,920
If you can figure out which
one sired the killer rabbits.

254
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:03,158
We interrupt this hologram

255
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:05,260
to bring you an
important bulletin.

256
00:12:05,295 --> 00:12:07,796
The horrific creatures
destroying New New York

257
00:12:07,831 --> 00:12:09,598
have begun
metamorphosing.

258
00:12:20,344 --> 00:12:22,310
Eat my shorts!
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

259
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:23,845
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

260
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,949
What a surprise.
It's Bart.

261
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:29,584
Wow,

262
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,786
I'm doing the same jokes
a thousand years later.

263
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:33,188
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

264
00:12:33,223 --> 00:12:36,258
But how did a mere boy
destroy the future?

265
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:37,626
Well...

266
00:12:47,905 --> 00:12:49,671
<i>Let this be a lesson.</i>

267
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:52,507
<i>Never throw meaningless crap</i>
<i>in a time capsule.</i>

268
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:56,177
That's it! All we have to do
is dig up the time capsule.

269
00:12:56,213 --> 00:12:57,712
And bury Bart in the hole.

270
00:12:57,748 --> 00:12:59,614
I thought people
in the future

271
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,616
would be more full
of peace and love.

272
00:13:01,652 --> 00:13:03,285
Like in Epcot Center.

273
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,354
In our time, Epcot Center
is a work farm for the weak.

274
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,856
Oh, but it's
not as crowded

275
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:11,493
as the slave labor camps
at Universal Studios.

276
00:13:15,032 --> 00:13:16,164
We're here.

277
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:22,404
My bowling buddy.

278
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:23,838
Hey!

279
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,508
You can't dig that up
for a thousand years.

280
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:28,009
Plus, I wrote
my name there.

281
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:30,045
See?

282
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:32,814
Shmayday!

283
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:35,684
Shmayday!
They got Scruffy!

284
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:37,752
Nope. They just
got my mustache.

285
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:40,288
But a life without a mustache
ain't worth livin'.

286
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:43,325
No!

287
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,393
That generator
powers the portal.

288
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:47,262
If they destroy it,
we'll be...

289
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,067
...sucked back
into the future.

290
00:13:57,874 --> 00:14:00,942
Okay, head count.
One, two, three...

291
00:14:00,978 --> 00:14:02,711
Where's Maggie?

292
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:06,514
Well, little meatbag,

293
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,783
it looks like it's
just you and me.

294
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:10,852
Stuck in a terrible past

295
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:12,253
where I know the result

296
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:14,956
of every horse race ever!

297
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:16,992
To the track!

298
00:14:19,963 --> 00:14:21,963
I want that.
Well, you can't have it.

299
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,044
Why, you little...
Why, you little...

300
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:30,612
Why, you little...

301
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:32,280
Why, you little...
Why, you little...

302
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:34,049
Dad, it's me.

303
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:35,584
Prove it.
When's your birthday?

304
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:36,985
February 23rd.

305
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:39,388
Ha! February has no 23rd.

306
00:14:39,423 --> 00:14:40,789
You...

307
00:14:40,824 --> 00:14:42,424
Yes, it does.

308
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:45,494
Can you please just get us
out of this lousy future?

309
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:49,464
Actually, of all probable
futures, this is the worst.

310
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,933
It is, 'cause
my baby's not in it.

311
00:14:51,969 --> 00:14:53,468
Motherly love.

312
00:14:53,504 --> 00:14:55,570
Why did we outlaw that?

313
00:14:55,606 --> 00:14:59,107
Madam, our mechanical friend
Bender is your portal home.

314
00:14:59,143 --> 00:15:02,277
But we can't use him until
the generator is repaired.

315
00:15:02,312 --> 00:15:04,279
Homer works
at a nuclear plant.

316
00:15:04,314 --> 00:15:05,981
He can help us get home.

317
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:08,083
Oh, are you good
at your job?

318
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:10,252
I was voted employee
of the month

319
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:12,487
as an April
Fools' Day joke.

320
00:15:12,523 --> 00:15:14,322
Why, you little...
Why, you little...

321
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:15,824
Great.

322
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:18,026
You and Fry
can bumble around together

323
00:15:18,062 --> 00:15:20,529
while the rest of us
give up and make peace

324
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:22,631
with our various deities.

325
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,934
As for me, I'm an atheist.

326
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:28,437
Oh, nobody's father,
who art nowhere,

327
00:15:28,472 --> 00:15:31,173
I know you can't hear me,
completely ignore this prayer.

328
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:35,010
Nothing art thou and nothing
will thou ever be.

329
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:37,879
Jesus was just a man.

330
00:15:37,915 --> 00:15:39,681
Amen.

331
00:15:39,717 --> 00:15:43,318
Well, I shall stay here
for the decadence.

332
00:15:43,353 --> 00:15:47,022
There's no debauchery like
end-of-the-world debauchery.

333
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:49,658
Your lips, my lips,
apocalypse, ooh!

334
00:15:49,693 --> 00:15:52,227
I can't believe you're all
giving up without a fight.

335
00:15:52,262 --> 00:15:53,729
Lisa,

336
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:56,131
we're just a package
delivery service.

337
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,532
And not a very
good one.

338
00:15:57,568 --> 00:15:59,201
The only way to handle
the creatures

339
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:01,303
is to do what we do
to each year's

340
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:04,406
Super Bowl losers:
shoot them into space.

341
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:06,508
But we'd have to
round them up first.

342
00:16:06,543 --> 00:16:07,976
Let me take care of that.

343
00:16:08,011 --> 00:16:09,578
If there's one thing
I know how to do,

344
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:11,413
it's manipulate Bart.

345
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:13,982
You're nuts.
I've got a will of iron.

346
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,190
Okay, let's get going.

347
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:28,263
Dad, we have beer
in our time.

348
00:16:28,298 --> 00:16:32,033
Hey, I haven't had a drink
in a thousand years.

349
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:37,405
There's a horse
called Bender's Bounty.

350
00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:39,407
But my memory says
he died during the race.

351
00:16:39,443 --> 00:16:41,409
That can't be true.

352
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:43,912
And way, way, way back
is Bender's Bounty.

353
00:16:43,947 --> 00:16:45,447
Damn it!

354
00:16:47,618 --> 00:16:49,518
Oh, chief, it
looks like a robot

355
00:16:49,553 --> 00:16:51,019
killing horses
over there.

356
00:16:51,054 --> 00:16:52,521
Oh, a 608...

357
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:55,290
Lou, can't you just
let me enjoy my day off?

358
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:57,459
W-Why are you dressed
in your uniform, then?

359
00:16:57,494 --> 00:16:59,261
'Cause they're
the only clothes that fit me.

360
00:16:59,296 --> 00:17:00,695
You happy? Happy?

361
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:03,031
Attention, goblins.

362
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:06,701
Madison Cube Garden is filled
with Butterfinger bars.

363
00:17:06,737 --> 00:17:09,104
And people are laying
fingers all over them.

364
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:13,375
They're evolving. Wow.

365
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,310
That's a first for you, Bart.

366
00:17:15,345 --> 00:17:17,379
Will you shut up?

367
00:17:34,331 --> 00:17:37,799
Uh, did I remind you
to strap yourselves in?

368
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:50,612
You realize you're
cheering the death

369
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:52,480
of millions of my children.

370
00:18:01,325 --> 00:18:03,158
Wow,

371
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:05,327
it's working.
I guess the instructions

372
00:18:05,362 --> 00:18:06,828
<i>were</i> in English.

373
00:18:06,864 --> 00:18:07,996
What the...

374
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:10,699
Whoa!

375
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:14,502
Hey, here's a souvenir photo of
you guys coming out of my chest.

376
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:17,439
Aw, I will treasure
this forever.

377
00:18:17,474 --> 00:18:18,773
Lie detected.

378
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:22,677
Oh, my sweet baby.

379
00:18:22,713 --> 00:18:25,547
Oh, feels like
you have a full diaper.

380
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:27,883
Ooh, um, I'll
change her.

381
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:33,255
Here's your cut.

382
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:36,224
Nice knowing you,
meatbags.

383
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,726
Have fun turning
to dust.

384
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:39,895
Wait, wait, wait.
You're the portal.

385
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,063
How are you gonna
get to the future?

386
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:44,099
The old-fashioned way.

387
00:18:48,405 --> 00:18:50,038
Good night, friend.

388
00:18:50,073 --> 00:18:52,307
You'll always have
a special place

389
00:18:52,342 --> 00:18:53,909
here with us.

390
00:19:11,762 --> 00:19:13,762
Thanks, pal.

391
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:26,110
Look at this mess.

392
00:19:26,145 --> 00:19:28,312
It would have
disintegrated upon entry

393
00:19:28,348 --> 00:19:31,616
if someone hadn't turned off
the atmosphere last night.

394
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:33,851
I like it cold
when I'm sleeping.

395
00:19:33,887 --> 00:19:37,121
Besides, these horrible
Earth creatures are delicious.

396
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:40,458
The Johnsons will be here
for dinner any minute.

397
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:42,827
What happened
to the handsome man I married?

398
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:44,328
I ate him, remember?

399
00:19:44,364 --> 00:19:45,830
Here they are.

400
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:47,832
Uh, hmm...

401
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:50,635
Hope we're not
interrupting anything.

402
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:54,972
I can't take any more.

403
00:19:58,411 --> 00:20:00,906
I-I can't
take it.

404
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:02,873
Well, perhaps the one of you
that is female

405
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:04,642
should go console her.
