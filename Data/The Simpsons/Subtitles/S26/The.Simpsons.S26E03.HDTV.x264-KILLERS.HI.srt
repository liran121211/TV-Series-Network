You're never bored
paintin' the Lord.

15
00:00:56,917 --> 00:01:00,018
Daddy, could you help us
with our school project?

16
00:01:00,054 --> 00:01:02,221
We're huntin'
vampire appliances!

17

Say no more.

18
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:05,090
Mm-hmm.

19
00:01:05,126 --> 00:01:06,492
Okay.

20
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:09,561
(grunting)

21
00:01:09,597 --> 00:01:11,263
Diddily, diddily...

(grunts)

23
00:01:13,134 --> 00:01:15,234
Well, we pulled more plugs
than a Dutch doctor.

24
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:17,503
Now let's take a trip
to the side of the house.

25
00:01:17,538 --> 00:01:18,737
BOTH:
Yay!

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,373
(gasps)
Why, that's a higher power

27
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:22,541
than even I believe in.

28
00:01:22,576 --> 00:01:24,009
What is going on?

29
00:01:24,044 --> 00:01:26,178
My room, kids' room,

30
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:29,381
knick-knack nook, Beatles
Bunker, Left-hand Lounge...

31
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:30,916
What's this?

32
00:01:33,454 --> 00:01:35,187
(carnival music plays)

33
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:37,322
(whooping)

34
00:01:39,326 --> 00:01:40,559
Huh?
(music stops)

35
00:01:40,594 --> 00:01:42,428
Hey, I was listening to that.

36
00:01:42,463 --> 00:01:44,296
Homer Simpson.

37
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:46,565
Got any other sockets
in my pockets?

38
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,967
Absolutely not.

39
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:50,235
Really? Really?

40
00:01:50,271 --> 00:01:51,603
Really?!

41
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:54,606
(groans) My one weakness--
the third "really."

42
00:01:54,642 --> 00:01:56,742
Come with me.

43
00:01:56,777 --> 00:01:58,377
(Homer grumbles, sighs)

44
00:01:58,412 --> 00:02:00,612
Turn right here.

45
00:02:00,648 --> 00:02:03,582
I keep this frozen meat
in case society collapses

46
00:02:03,617 --> 00:02:04,983
but we still have power.

47
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:06,985
Homer! This is my freezerino.

48
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:12,391
Seriously, I am getting so tired
of those stupid Flandersisms.

49
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:14,393
It's the name
of the freezer!

50
00:02:14,428 --> 00:02:16,495
Okily Dokahama?

51
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,164
Right next to Mount Fu-Gee,
I'm glad to see ya!

52
00:02:22,636 --> 00:02:24,269
Aw. It's all gonna thaw!

53
00:02:24,305 --> 00:02:26,738
Don't you give up on me!

54
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:30,309
I'll cook this meat, cut it up
and make it into sandwiches.

55
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:33,445
And I will wait and worry!

(no voice)

58
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:07,279
So, I cooked the meat,
sliced it up, made sandwiches,

59
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:10,215
cut off the crust,
fed those to the dog...

60
00:03:10,251 --> 00:03:13,218
Aw, somebody wants more crust.

61
00:03:13,254 --> 00:03:14,386
Here you go, boy!

62
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:21,426
Here you go.
Have some more.

63
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:25,030
Still hungry, buddy?

64
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:27,466
Dad, dogs don't know
when to stop eating.

65
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:28,567
Lucky.

66
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:31,470
Ta-DA!

67
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:32,505
ALL:
Whoa!

68
00:03:34,275 --> 00:03:38,076
Oh, Marge, once again you've
taken one of my screwups

69
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,912
and turned it into food.

70
00:03:39,947 --> 00:03:42,414
Man, if only you could
do that with Bart.

71
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:47,052
Mom! Dad's imagining me
as food again!

72
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:48,820
He does it
to all of us.

73
00:03:48,856 --> 00:03:50,656
Can someone put
butter on me?

74
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:52,090
HOMER:
Family-icious.

75
00:03:53,794 --> 00:03:56,929
Come on, where's
that butter?

76
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:01,066
Hey, Mom,
can you pack me

77
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:03,368
a dozen sandwiches
in my lunch tomorrow?

78
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:05,370
Meat, no meat,
it's all good.

79
00:04:05,406 --> 00:04:06,406
Sandwiches, Mom.

80
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
Fill 'er up.

81
00:04:07,474 --> 00:04:08,507
And the garment bag.

82
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:09,908
What's going on?

83
00:04:09,944 --> 00:04:11,877
Are you kids
eating your feelings?

84
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:13,812
No, whenever anything
bothers me,

85
00:04:13,847 --> 00:04:15,981
I harmlessly vent it to Maggie.

86
00:04:18,485 --> 00:04:22,054
I smash fluorescent lights
at the gravel pit.

87
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,956
But that's
so many sandwiches.

88
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:24,991
Kids love them.

89
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:26,291
We trade them
at school.

90
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:27,960
They replaced cigarettes
as our currency.

91
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:29,428
Bubble gum cigarettes?

92
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:30,896
Yeah, sure.

93
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:33,432
(doorbell rings)

94
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:36,401
What are you doing here,
freezer stealer?

95
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:39,938
Ned's letting us use his freezer
to store the extra sandwiches.

96
00:04:39,974 --> 00:04:42,975
Well, I felt a little guilty for
taking back what belonged to me.

97
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,010
(whoops)

98
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:45,544
Flanders isn't perfect!

99
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:47,079
(chuckling):
Never claimed to be.

100
00:04:47,114 --> 00:04:48,614
Yeah, and aren't.

101
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:53,919
Marge, see this face?

102
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:55,053
It's opportunity.

103
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:56,488
Blink, and you'll miss it.

104
00:04:57,524 --> 00:04:58,657
Huh?

105
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:00,125
Just kidding.
I'm right behind you.

106
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,493
I'm Trudy Zengler,

107
00:05:01,528 --> 00:05:03,395
vice president
of development

108
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,631
for Mother Hubbard's
Sandwich Cupboards.

109
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:09,301
How would you like to
run your own business?

110
00:05:09,336 --> 00:05:11,703
Take control of your
financial future.

111
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:12,971
Hmm.

112
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:17,643
Homie, how much money
do we have put aside

113
00:05:17,678 --> 00:05:20,278
in case something
happens to you?

114
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:24,016
None.

115
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:26,018
(groans)

116
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:29,421
If that flashback you
just described is true,

117
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:31,523
you can't afford not
to open this franchise.

118
00:05:31,558 --> 00:05:32,858
I'm in.

119
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:36,939
Wow, Mom!

120
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:38,407
You're gonna open
a sandwich store?

121
00:05:38,443 --> 00:05:39,575
Uh-huh.

122
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,210
Mom, if you're
gonna do this,

123
00:05:41,245 --> 00:05:43,412
there's one thing
I need to know.

124
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:44,580
And be honest.

125
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:46,415
What's your soda refill policy?

126
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:49,485
All you can drink,
if you buy a jumbo cup.

127
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,421
Careful, Marge, that's
how I bankrupted a Pizza Hut.

128
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:57,960
Mmm... that's good.

129
00:05:57,995 --> 00:06:00,429
More, more.

130
00:06:00,465 --> 00:06:02,231
Refill...

131
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:03,432
Free!

132
00:06:03,468 --> 00:06:04,500
I-I just... I...

133
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:05,868
Where is it going?

134
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,910
My store.

135
00:06:14,946 --> 00:06:17,112
My offset spatula.

136
00:06:17,148 --> 00:06:18,414
Mine!

137
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:19,682
(door opens, bell rings)

138
00:06:21,652 --> 00:06:23,452
Well, well, well.

139
00:06:23,488 --> 00:06:25,120
Seems like someone forgot

140
00:06:25,156 --> 00:06:28,457
there's a Krusty Burger
two blocks away.

141
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:29,758
Go ahead, Teeny.

142
00:06:29,794 --> 00:06:31,961
Show 'em what we did to Arby's.

143
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:45,674
She did the one thing
I never could-- feed him.

144
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,710
You're a cool
customer, Marge.

145
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:49,044
And we've got
your back.

146
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,280
With everything from
pre-sliced tomatoes,

147
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:53,349
to the homey needlepoint
on the walls.

148
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:55,150
Aw...

149
00:06:55,186 --> 00:06:58,454
And now, the best part of
running your own franchise--

150
00:06:58,489 --> 00:07:00,389
picking your Sammy Fammy.

151
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:01,991
You'll want to avoid that.

152
00:07:06,998 --> 00:07:09,832
Your monkey just
ate all my turkey.

153
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,734
You want some monkey meat
to replace it?

154
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:12,835
No.

155
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,903
It's low-fat.

156
00:07:13,938 --> 00:07:15,905
GIL:
<i>As you can see, I was just two</i>

157
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,172
<i>credits short</i>
<i>at Southern Illinois, and...</i>

158
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,074
I got to be honest
with you, Marge.

159
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,744
I need this job bad.

160
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:25,414
Hmm... You seem to have had,
and lost, a lot of jobs.

161
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:27,249
It's a whole
new world, Marge.

162
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:28,851
A whole new world.

163
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:31,220
Why, my dad spent his
whole life at one company.

164
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:33,022
Started in the
basement mailroom,

165
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:36,191
and ended his career jumping out
the window from the top floor.

166
00:07:36,227 --> 00:07:37,326
(groans)

167
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:39,361
Yeah, he was
wearing this suit.

168
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:40,397
Corpse suit.

169
00:07:44,435 --> 00:07:46,035
I'm not sure...

170
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,903
this is going to work out.

171
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:49,271
Oh, I get it.

172
00:07:49,307 --> 00:07:50,940
You won't hire me
because I'm pretty.

173
00:07:50,975 --> 00:07:52,274
That could be
a lawsuit.

174
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,343
No lawsuit! You're hired!

175
00:07:54,378 --> 00:07:56,045
Okay, so I don't
want to do anything

176
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,580
that'll ruin
my manicure.

177
00:07:57,615 --> 00:07:59,248
Well, then why do you
want this job?

178
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:01,116
So I can get manicures.

179
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:02,184
Duh!

180
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:03,786
Professor,
could you say,

181
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:06,355
"Welcome to Mother Hubbard's
Sandwich Cupboard"

182
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,090
without making
any other noises?

183
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,092
Of course I can, my dear child.

184
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:11,360
Welcome to...

185
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:12,761
Mother Hubbard's...

186
00:08:12,797 --> 00:08:14,763
uh... Sandwich

187
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:18,767
mcboing boing glavin
flyvy hyvy goyvyn,

188
00:08:18,803 --> 00:08:21,236
and now I'm running
to the unemployment office.

189
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:22,805
Blervyk.

190
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:25,441
(Marge groaning)

191
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:27,376
I'm too nervous to sleep.

192
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:28,411
(Homer grunts)

193
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:29,545
(sighs)

194
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,813
(grunts sleepily)

195
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:32,715
(sighs aggressively)

196
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,283
(stammers awake)

197
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:35,818
I'm sorry I
woke you up.

198
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:38,554
I'm just so anxious
about tomorrow.

199
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:40,055
What if the
store fails?

200
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:41,423
What if I fail?

201
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:44,727
Well, you woke up
the right man in bed.

202
00:08:44,762 --> 00:08:46,228
I love you, Marjorie.

203
00:08:46,263 --> 00:08:48,731
And I've had my share
of failures, sure.

204
00:08:48,766 --> 00:08:51,233
And sometimes
I get pretty nervous.

205
00:08:51,268 --> 00:08:53,602
But thanks for
talking it out with me.

206
00:08:53,638 --> 00:08:56,405
I think I can finally
get to sleep now.

207
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,773
No! No, no, no!

208
00:08:57,808 --> 00:08:59,475
It was me that
couldn't get to...

209
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,310
(snoring)

210
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:03,312
(sighs)

211
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:04,580
(stammers awake)

212
00:09:04,615 --> 00:09:05,914
Oh, make love now?

213
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,516
(groans)

214
00:09:08,552 --> 00:09:10,586
Say there, buddy,

215
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:13,022
are you interested
in our Two-For-One Tuesday?

216
00:09:13,057 --> 00:09:15,124
I never would have been,
till I got this flyer!

217
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,593
Interested in some
exotic dancers, huh?

218
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:20,429
Today's "Tell You
Their Real Name" Tuesday.

219
00:09:20,464 --> 00:09:22,598
Are you working
two jobs here, Gil?

220
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:25,701
No, and I resent
the accusation.

221
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:28,337
Tell me, it's
pointing west, right?

222
00:09:28,372 --> 00:09:29,972
<i>Hola.</i>

223
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:31,707
No change
for the meter.

224
00:09:31,742 --> 00:09:35,110
No, no, I'd like
to see the manager.

225
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:36,612
Mrs. Boss!

226
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:38,647
Some fat blob wants
to see you.

227
00:09:38,683 --> 00:09:39,683
MARGE:
Homer!

228
00:09:39,684 --> 00:09:40,684
Marge.

229
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:41,884
Come on, let's celebrate!

230
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,052
It's your first day!

231
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:44,820
Homie, I'm
a little worried.

232
00:09:44,855 --> 00:09:49,324
Do you know there were no
customers between 2:00 and 4:00?

233
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,561
Hey, Tony Roma's wasn't
built in a day.

234
00:09:52,596 --> 00:09:55,330
But don't worry, I told everyone
about this place,

235
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:57,232
and they're all going
to support you.

236
00:09:57,268 --> 00:09:58,834
You do have drone delivery,
right?

237
00:09:58,869 --> 00:09:59,968
I kind of promised that.

238
00:10:00,004 --> 00:10:01,870
We don't have drone delivery!

239
00:10:01,906 --> 00:10:03,706
You'll have
to find a substitute.

240
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:06,075
(humming a tune)

241
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,409
HOMER:
Damn it!

242
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:10,879
(humming)

243
00:10:13,117 --> 00:10:15,384
(Marge groaning)

244
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:18,721
(groans)

245
00:10:18,756 --> 00:10:20,022
What's wrong?

246
00:10:20,057 --> 00:10:22,357
Mother Hubbard Central
expects you to buy

247
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:24,259
a lot of stuff
from them.

248
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:26,195
Uniforms, fixin's.

249
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,063
It's like they don't care
if you make money

250
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:29,732
as long as
they make money.

251
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:32,301
What kind of corporation
does that?

252
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:36,205
(stammers) I'm not trying
to be political,

253
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,408
but I'm the only one
you can trust here.

254
00:10:40,778 --> 00:10:42,111
(gasps)

255
00:10:43,414 --> 00:10:46,181
Shauna! I saw that!

256
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:47,950
I'm going to have
to let you go.

257
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:49,718
Oh, so you're,
like, firing me

258
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:52,020
like in that movie
where that girl gets fired?

259
00:10:52,056 --> 00:10:53,355
I'm sorry.

260
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,390
If I'm fired,

261
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:55,425
then he's quitting!

262
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:57,392
I am?!

263
00:10:57,428 --> 00:11:00,763
Oh, that's what
holds them up.

264
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:03,198
What am I going to do?

265
00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:05,534
I'm down two employees
and it's the afternoon rush.

266
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:07,803
(bell dings)

267
00:11:07,838 --> 00:11:09,471
I need a six-foot party sub.

268
00:11:09,507 --> 00:11:11,940
Lots of mayonnaise.
And I mean lots.

269
00:11:11,976 --> 00:11:13,876
Never stop squirting mayo.

270
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:15,444
Don't worry, baby.

271
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:17,946
(humming a tune)

272
00:11:22,453 --> 00:11:24,653
Thank you, Homie.

273
00:11:24,688 --> 00:11:27,656
Why does this have
to be so hard?!

274
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:30,225
Oh, uh, sorry
there, Marge.

275
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:32,227
This is my changing room.

276
00:11:32,263 --> 00:11:34,496
You are working two jobs!

277
00:11:34,532 --> 00:11:36,431
No, these are my real legs.

278
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:39,268
I'm... I'm not a
well man, Marge.

279
00:11:41,872 --> 00:11:43,505
This is so sad.

280
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,642
In his homeland,
Dad was a nuclear engineer.

281
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:50,012
Oh, I was short-staffed
and your father volunteered.

282
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:53,615
Actually, I was wondering if you
two might want to lend a hand.

283
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:55,017
No, no.

284
00:11:55,052 --> 00:11:57,186
You want to make
American kids work?

285
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:58,587
You're supposed
to be driving me

286
00:11:58,622 --> 00:12:00,422
to a tennis class
I said I wanted,

287
00:12:00,457 --> 00:12:03,025
then I changed my mind
and I hate it so much

288
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,793
I'm faking stomachaches
to get out of it.

289
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:07,262
Would it kill one of you
to wash a bell pepper?

290
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:09,765
Um, I'm not sure this is
the best use of my skills.

291
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,999
I said wash!

292
00:12:11,035 --> 00:12:13,302
And, Bart, go work
the deep fryer.

293
00:12:13,337 --> 00:12:15,470
Well, if I'll be doing this
when I'm 40,

294
00:12:15,506 --> 00:12:17,506
might as well start now.

295
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,541
(humming a tune)

296
00:12:22,146 --> 00:12:23,645
(gasps)

297
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:25,314
I'm home.

298
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:27,683
Guys, this is gonna be
hard for a while.

299
00:12:27,718 --> 00:12:30,185
But we'll get through this
as a family.

300
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:31,954
Yes, we will.

301
00:12:31,989 --> 00:12:34,890
The Simpsons
and old Uncle Gil.

302
00:12:34,925 --> 00:12:36,892
Uh, Gil?

303
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:39,194
I've been meaning to
tell you you're fired.

304
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,897
Yeah, well,
guess I had it coming.

305
00:12:41,932 --> 00:12:43,966
Can I take
some bologna heels?

306
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:45,067
As many as you like.

307
00:12:45,102 --> 00:12:46,168
You sure?

308
00:12:46,203 --> 00:12:47,703
Take them!

309
00:12:47,738 --> 00:12:50,806
Aw, yeah!
It's a big ol' fat one!

Real good baby.

Good everybody.

324
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:42,691
You won't believe it,

325
00:13:42,726 --> 00:13:45,494
but we actually turned
a profit today.

326
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:49,865
Kids, we're taking
some shredded lettuce,

327
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,834
pre-sliced cheese and cold cuts,

328
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,606
and turning them
into the American dream.

329
00:13:57,641 --> 00:14:00,442
Uh, guys,
what the hell is that?

330
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:05,247
(gasps)

331
00:14:05,282 --> 00:14:07,082
They're opening
another Mother Hubbard?

332
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:09,985
Across the street?!
How could they?

333
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,386
How could they?!

334
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:13,889
CHIEF WIGGUM:
Move, move, move!

335
00:14:17,594 --> 00:14:19,061
Eh, Chief, uh,
who are you fooling

336
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:21,096
with this one sandwich
a day diet?

337
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:23,031
It's on whole wheat, Lou.

338
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:25,600
Cleans up your insides.

339
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:26,969
I'm gonna sit
next to it.

340
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:31,841
How could they open another
franchise so close to me?

341
00:14:31,841 --> 00:14:34,042
Don't worry, Marge.
They can't beat us.

342
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:35,843
Because we're family-run.

343
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:38,279
Aah! Hillbillies!

344
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,518
Okay, in you go,
Minimum Wade, Addem-up,

345
00:14:43,553 --> 00:14:47,222
Oxycontin, Fontanelle
and Pediculus.

346
00:14:47,257 --> 00:14:49,691
You make way for those
that's nocturnal

347
00:14:49,726 --> 00:14:51,659
coming off the night shift.

348
00:14:51,695 --> 00:14:53,228
(squealing)

349
00:14:53,263 --> 00:14:54,929
Huh?

350
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:58,032
(sighs)

351
00:14:58,068 --> 00:15:00,034
(yawns)

352
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,437
Mom, I need a few hours off.

353
00:15:02,472 --> 00:15:05,240
It's Milhouse's birthday party
and I'm all the guests.

354
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:06,741
I understand, honey.

355
00:15:06,776 --> 00:15:09,043
Did you get someone to cover?
Mm. Grampa.

356
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:11,045
I'm working the drive-through!

357
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:12,947
There is no drive-through!

358
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:14,082
(coos)

359
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:17,252
No, thank coo!

360
00:15:20,123 --> 00:15:21,789
(sighs)

361
00:15:21,825 --> 00:15:24,525
(door opens, bell dings)
Ah, finally-- a customer!

362
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:26,094
Aah!

363
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:27,562
Simpson,
why aren't you at work?

364
00:15:27,597 --> 00:15:29,631
Whoa, hold
that famous temper, Smithers.

365
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,766
Who is this?

366
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:36,904
Simpson, introduce me
to this almond-eyed beauty,

367
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,940
and all is forgiven.

368
00:15:38,975 --> 00:15:41,075
Uh, Mr. Burns, I'd
like you to meet...

369
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:43,144
Mother Hubbard standee.

370
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:45,079
From the Wisconsin Standees!

371
00:15:45,115 --> 00:15:47,915
Milk-fed, yet so slim.

372
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:51,753
Permit me to play you a tune
on my mouth organ.

373
00:15:51,788 --> 00:15:53,288
Sir, maybe we should go.

374
00:15:53,323 --> 00:15:54,722
Sorry you died!

375
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:57,158
Put the body with the others.

376
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,596
Whew.

377
00:16:01,631 --> 00:16:03,631
Homer, if I ever
seem that senile,

378
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,233
get a gun and...

379
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:07,435
What are you doing
with that gun?!

380
00:16:08,471 --> 00:16:09,570
Marge, have you ever

381
00:16:09,606 --> 00:16:10,606
seen pants do this?

382
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,106
(gasps)

383
00:16:12,142 --> 00:16:15,109
You're working so hard
you've lost weight!

384
00:16:15,145 --> 00:16:16,678
We're killing ourselves
trying to run

385
00:16:16,713 --> 00:16:18,946
a restaurant no one goes to.

386
00:16:18,982 --> 00:16:20,615
I've never said
this to you before,

387
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,116
but I'm saying it now.

388
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:24,285
I'm going to Moe's.

389
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:26,454
(gasps)

390
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,258
Now I know why you
come here so much.

391
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:32,860
No matter how sad
you are inside,

392
00:16:32,896 --> 00:16:34,996
what you see looks worse.

393
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:37,265
Yeah. It was really hard
for me to make this place

394
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,634
look old but not
in any way comfortable.

395
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:42,170
Now maybe some
TV will cheer you up.

396
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:45,173
If you's in the mood
for a sammich, come on down

397
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,975
to Mother Hubbard's
Sandwich Cupboard Express,

398
00:16:48,011 --> 00:16:50,611
for all the sandwiches you love!

399
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:51,779
Bread sammich.

400
00:16:51,815 --> 00:16:52,947
Yesterday's what's-it

401
00:16:52,982 --> 00:16:54,282
with ketchup.

402
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:56,484
And the thing
what ate our chickens.

403
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,053
BRANDINE:
Looks like a fox, but it ain't.

404
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:03,057
Be sure to follow us
on Kinterest and Critter!

405
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:07,128
Aw! "Yesterday's what's-it"?

406
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:09,130
Why does everyone go to them?

407
00:17:09,165 --> 00:17:10,965
It's express, Marge.

408
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,868
Yeah, with our busy lifestyle,
we got to have express.

409
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:19,707
Aw. Listen there, Midge.

410
00:17:19,743 --> 00:17:22,477
I know how to get yous
out of your contract.

411
00:17:22,512 --> 00:17:24,011
But I got to warn you...

412
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:26,714
you will never work in the
fast-food industry again.

413
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,950
Go on. Please.

414
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,320
<i>So, you see, Ms. Zengler,</i>

415
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:34,522
the Mother Hubbard's Express
across the street

416
00:17:34,557 --> 00:17:36,824
is stealing all our business.

417
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,393
It's not fair.

418
00:17:38,428 --> 00:17:40,995
If you want fairness,
work at a Sunglass Hut.

419
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,064
This is the sandwich game.

420
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:44,699
I don't understand you.

421
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:46,234
I grew up in the
pageant system.

422
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:49,470
Oh. Now I completely
understand you.

423
00:17:49,506 --> 00:17:51,539
I'm a litigious
businessman,

424
00:17:51,574 --> 00:17:53,875
and I need a
coffee to go.

425
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,043
One jumbo Joe to go!

426
00:17:58,214 --> 00:17:59,947
(yells in pain)

427
00:17:59,983 --> 00:18:01,949
Get the first-aid kit!

428
00:18:01,985 --> 00:18:03,851
One Florence Nightingale
in a box!

429
00:18:03,887 --> 00:18:05,353
And make it snappy!

430
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:07,388
Ow!

431
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:09,357
I got this.

432
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:10,858
Ow!

433
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:13,861
Oh, why do these things happen
to innocent victims?

434
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:15,863
I was just
about to become

435
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:18,433
a million-dollar
crotch model!

436
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:21,102
Hey, hey, hey!
It's not corporate's fault!

437
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:22,137
Really?

438
00:18:22,172 --> 00:18:23,805
But the franchise
agreement says

439
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,706
Mother Hubbard Inc. would
provide adequate training

440
00:18:25,742 --> 00:18:27,975
for all employees,
which they didn't.

441
00:18:28,011 --> 00:18:30,978
Clause 27C-3.

442
00:18:31,014 --> 00:18:32,814
(scoffs)
You actually read this thing?

443
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:34,615
It was written
by two lawyers who had

444
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:36,384
to keep waking the other one up.

445
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,821
If you'll just give me back
my original investment,

446
00:18:39,856 --> 00:18:43,057
I'll take full responsibility
for this man's injuries.

447
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:46,994
Please... tell me
I'm still beautiful!

448
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,363
All right, Marge.
You've got a deal.

449
00:18:54,437 --> 00:18:56,337
Well, family, we
should be proud.

450
00:18:56,372 --> 00:18:59,607
We took on corporate
America and broke even.

451
00:18:59,642 --> 00:19:01,142
Hear, hear!

452
00:19:01,177 --> 00:19:02,743
Sir?

453
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:04,812
I-I think we've
gone far enough

454
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:06,180
to dispose of the body.

455
00:19:06,216 --> 00:19:07,682
Dispose? Ooh.

456
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:10,251
I've come here to pitch woo.

457
00:19:10,286 --> 00:19:12,453
