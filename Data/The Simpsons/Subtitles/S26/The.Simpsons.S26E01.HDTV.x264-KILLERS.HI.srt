D'oh. D'oh. D'oh. D'oh. D'oh.

17
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:21,976
Family.

18
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:24,245
Meet me at...

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,480
the kitchen cube.

20
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:27,815
D'oh. D'oh.

21
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,084
D'oh. D'oh. D'oh.
(electric crackling)

22
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,986
(growling voice):
I am Simpson.

23
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:34,755
I am Simpson.
I am Simpson.

24
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:36,590
(gurgling)

25
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:39,794
(distorted) Don't... Don't
have cow, man.

26
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:43,297
I am Simpson. I am Simpson.
Don't... Don't have cow, man.

27
00:01:43,332 --> 00:01:47,902
Don't... Don't have cow, man.
I am Simpson. I am Simpson.

28
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:52,039
(distorted): Hail the dark lord
of the twin moons.

29
00:01:52,074 --> 00:01:55,543
I am Simpson. I am Simpson.
Don't have cow, man.

30
00:01:55,578 --> 00:01:57,178
(gurgling)
(growls) Simpson.

31
00:01:57,213 --> 00:02:00,114
Cow, man.
I am Simpson. I am Simpson.

32
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:01,715
(babbling)

33
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:03,551
(squishing)

34
00:02:03,586 --> 00:02:06,554
(low voice): Make purchase
of the merchandise.

35
00:02:06,589 --> 00:02:08,489
D'oh.
Don't have cow, man.

36
00:02:08,524 --> 00:02:11,058
I have... memories.

37
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:14,094
(high-pitched tone)
<i>I have.... memor... memor...</i>

38
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,864
(grinding, beeping)

39
00:02:16,899 --> 00:02:19,033
(gentle piano playing)

40
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:21,969
(high-pitched):
Still love you, Homar.

41
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:25,739
(high-pitched, distorted):
We are happy family.

42
00:02:31,747 --> 00:02:34,281
All animals can scream.

43
00:02:34,317 --> 00:02:36,417
(low growling) Make purchase of
the merchandise.

44
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:39,887
I am Simpson. I am Simpson.
Don't have cow, man.

45
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:41,889
D'oh.

46
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:51,966
Three feet, nine inches.

47
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:53,701
That should do it.
Don't you know

48
00:02:53,736 --> 00:02:55,736
what kind of animal
we're dealing with?

49
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:58,138
Okay, enough theory.

50
00:02:58,174 --> 00:02:59,940
Hey, Dad.
We made popcorn.

51
00:02:59,976 --> 00:03:01,308
HOMER:
Woo-hoo!

52
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:03,811
Huh? Out of my reach?

53
00:03:03,846 --> 00:03:07,648
(grunts)
Must... make... effort.

54
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,419
(grunting)

55
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,590
(bones crack)

56
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:17,558
Yay.

57
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:19,994
Mr. Simpson,
you earned this.

58
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:22,796
(quiet grunts)

59
00:03:22,832 --> 00:03:24,265
What's on TV?

60
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,267
Krusty's getting
roasted tonight.

61
00:03:36,345 --> 00:03:37,745
Hey.

62
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,780
(grumbles)
Sometimes the language

63
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:42,950
on these gets a
little B-L-U-E.

64
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:44,118
What?

65
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:45,753
Oh.

66
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:47,821
If you don't let us watch,
we'll just go to a house

67
00:03:47,857 --> 00:03:49,690
where some more
permissive parents will.

68
00:03:49,725 --> 00:03:51,025
How permissive?

69
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,494
Chief Wiggum shows us
crime photos at sleepovers.

70
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:55,429
So this is what a body
looks like

71
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:58,465
after it drops
60 stories.

72
00:03:58,501 --> 00:04:00,668
Uh, come on, Milhouse,
don't pretend you're asleep.

73
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:02,303
This is the world we live in.

74
00:04:02,338 --> 00:04:03,504
Yeah.

75
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:04,905
(crowd laughs over TV)

76
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:07,875
Hey, Krusty, our local deli
just named a sandwich after you.

77
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,477
It's called
"The Unfunny Comedian."

78
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:11,513
(crowd laughs)

79
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:12,479
You will always be
remembered for

80
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:13,981
your countless
appearances on

81
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:15,349
the<i> Krusty the Clown Show</i>

82
00:04:15,384 --> 00:04:17,685
and your one appearance
on<i> To Catch A Predator.</i>

83
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,153
(crowd laughs)

84
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:21,922
Hey, I spent a lifetime
making people happy.

85
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,892
Yeah-- plastic surgeons
and divorce lawyers.

86
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:26,694
I was just about to say that.

87
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:29,163
Oh, he took my laugh.

88
00:04:29,198 --> 00:04:30,864
Screw it, I'm doing it anyway.

89
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,735
Plastic surgeons
and divorce lawyers.

90
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,537
(man coughs)

91
00:04:36,572 --> 00:04:38,706
What a legend. Krusty
the Clown is to comedy

92
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:41,609
what Martin Luther King
is to comedy.

93
00:04:41,644 --> 00:04:42,776
(laughter)

94
00:04:45,114 --> 00:04:47,548
We've seen a lot
of top-flight comics tonight,

95
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,550
but that's over,
because it's time

96
00:04:49,585 --> 00:04:51,619
to hear from Krusty the Clown.

97
00:04:51,654 --> 00:04:52,886
Welcome, Krusty.

98
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:54,521
I grew up watching you.

99
00:04:54,557 --> 00:04:55,856
Oh, uh, sorry.

100
00:04:55,891 --> 00:04:57,825
I threw up watching you.

101
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,159
(laughter, applause)

102
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:00,461
(grumbles)

103
00:05:00,496 --> 00:05:01,929
Sarah Silverman.

104
00:05:01,964 --> 00:05:05,099
I say this with love,
you disrespectful skank.

105
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:07,801
You've had more... Oh.

106
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:10,037
Suddenly, I don't
feel like doing this.

107
00:05:10,072 --> 00:05:11,072
(gasps)

108
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:14,808
Sorry, Mini-ha-ha.
Canceling the bit.

109
00:05:14,844 --> 00:05:17,111
Tell the others.

110
00:05:18,648 --> 00:05:21,649
I thought this night would be
fun for me and my friends.

111
00:05:21,684 --> 00:05:23,384
I don't even know these people.

112
00:05:24,787 --> 00:05:26,787
And I guess I don't
have any friends.

113
00:05:26,822 --> 00:05:28,956
My only comfort
is the roast is over

114
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:30,824
and will only be shown
four times a day

115
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,494
for the rest of all time.

116
00:05:34,797 --> 00:05:36,163
Krusty.

117
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:37,765
Yeah?
Is your nose red

118
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,967
because it's embarrassed
to be seen with you?

119
00:05:40,002 --> 00:05:41,402
(laughter)
Oh, nobody warned me

120
00:05:41,437 --> 00:05:43,370
this roast would treat me
the same way

121
00:05:43,406 --> 00:05:46,774
as every roast I've seen
and laughed at.

122
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:49,543
...and the husband says,
"Who paid you a nickel?"

123
00:05:49,578 --> 00:05:51,211
And the wife says,
"Everybody."

124
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:52,446
(laughs)

125
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:55,516
Oh, sorry,
wrong for this audience.

126
00:05:55,551 --> 00:05:57,418
I thought Swapper Jack's
was something else.

127
00:05:58,921 --> 00:06:01,155
Krusty, sorry
about the roast.

128
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,624
They had no right to say
those hilarious things.

129
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:06,326
How could they say
I'm past my prime?

130
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:08,762
Me-- the voice of Ovaltine.

131
00:06:08,798 --> 00:06:10,597
Krusty, why don't you
talk to your dad?

132
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:12,433
He'll cheer you up.
He's a rabbi.

133
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:14,301
He must've learned something
from that giant star scroll

134
00:06:14,336 --> 00:06:15,636
he's always reading.

135
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:18,639
Kid, does talking to your dad
make you feel better?

136
00:06:18,674 --> 00:06:20,741
Well, no, but he's not a rabbi.

137
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:23,110
More of a flabbi.
(snorts, laughs)

138
00:06:23,145 --> 00:06:25,913
Why, you little...
I'll show you who's a flabbi!

139
00:06:25,948 --> 00:06:27,448
(grunting)

140
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:28,782
(muffled):
No, you're not a flabbi!

141
00:06:28,818 --> 00:06:30,184
Yeah, all muscle.

142
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:32,753
In Minnesota, I'd be a supermodel.
Okay, I got it.

143
00:06:35,057 --> 00:06:39,126
So, basically, I came here
so you could tell me the truth--

144
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:40,561
that I'm great.

145
00:06:40,596 --> 00:06:43,864
As the Torah says:
Judgment belongs to God.

146
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:45,699
The Torah also says
you can't eat ham,

147
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:47,835
and I'm the spokesman
for HamCo Ham.

148
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,671
This is why I only call you
on Christmas and Easter.

149
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:52,639
Wait, wait, wait. Please, Dad.

150
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:54,675
Do you even think I'm funny?

151
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,976
I'm not gonna lie
to you, for funny,

152
00:06:56,011 --> 00:06:57,544
I prefer Rabbi Rudenstein.

153
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,848
He puts the "ha" in Hanukah
and the "levity" in Leviticus.

154
00:07:00,883 --> 00:07:02,783
As for you, son,
if you want to know

155
00:07:02,818 --> 00:07:06,754
my honest opinion of you,
you've always been... eh.

156
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:08,689
Go on.

157
00:07:08,724 --> 00:07:11,692
I've always been
"Eh... ntertaining"?

158
00:07:13,028 --> 00:07:14,228
Dad?

159
00:07:16,632 --> 00:07:18,065
Show me nose fog.

160
00:07:20,102 --> 00:07:21,969
Oh, God, he's dead.

161
00:07:22,004 --> 00:07:24,972
And he never lived
to see me be successful.

162
00:07:25,007 --> 00:07:26,740
(sobbing)

163
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:34,089
<i>A pusten fas hilcht hecher.</i>

164
00:07:34,124 --> 00:07:36,825
"An empty barrel
reverberates loudly."

165
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,461
And today, my heart
is that barrel.

166
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:42,464
Even though my father and I
had our difficulties,

167
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:44,599
(sobs) he was a great man.

168
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:46,568
And, well, he always...

169
00:07:48,438 --> 00:07:50,105
Wha?
Eh.

170
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,940
Eh. Eh.
Eh.

171
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:54,209
Eh. Eh.
Eh.

172
00:07:58,381 --> 00:07:59,381
(sighs)

173
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:00,882
Look, I'm an entertainer.

174
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:03,985
So maybe the best way to say
how I feel about my dad

175
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,887
is through a song

176
00:08:05,922 --> 00:08:08,656
that someone else wrote
that I hired people to sing.

177
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:10,291
This is for you, Dad.

Yeah, well, it's just...
well, I thought...

184
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:28,543
Seriously, it can be really
tough to lose your father.

185
00:08:28,578 --> 00:08:29,777
(crying)

186
00:08:33,016 --> 00:08:34,415
RUDENSTEIN:
<i>Yasher Co-ack.</i>

187
00:08:34,451 --> 00:08:36,417
Let us all please rise.

188
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:39,254
(snoring)
Homer, get up.

189
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:41,723
Huh? Oh, uh...

190
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:44,159
(grunting)

191
00:08:44,194 --> 00:08:45,627
Oh! Oh!

192
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:47,695
Ooh!
(panting)

193
00:08:47,731 --> 00:08:49,597
Dad, are you okay?

194
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:51,900
Yeah, yeah, great. (sighs)

195
00:08:51,935 --> 00:08:55,003
I guess my getting-up
days are over.

196
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:56,171
(gasps)

197
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,308
(humming a tune)

198
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:02,377
Dad, you're eating
too much.

199
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:04,145
I'm worried about
your health.

200
00:09:04,181 --> 00:09:06,014
I don't want
to lose you.

201
00:09:08,051 --> 00:09:09,918
(softly):
Oh, no.

202
00:09:09,953 --> 00:09:12,654
Krusty, I brought some
homemade chicken soup.

203
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:15,690
We used the Play-Doh maker
for the matzo.

204
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:18,693
Uh, thanks, but I don't
really like soup.

205
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:21,229
But you wear that little spoon
around your neck.

206
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:22,430
(chuckles)

207
00:09:22,465 --> 00:09:23,998
You really notice
stuff, don't you?

208
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:26,668
Yes. And I can tell
how hard it was

209
00:09:26,703 --> 00:09:28,169
to lose your father.

210
00:09:28,205 --> 00:09:30,805
But at least you were there
to share his final thoughts.

211
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,906
Eh.

212
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:33,942
No, no, it's a big thing.

213
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:35,276
No, that's what he called me.

214
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:36,477
"Eh."

215
00:09:36,513 --> 00:09:38,413
Mm. It could be worse.

216
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:39,681
Oh, yeah? How?

217
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:40,748
I don't know, uh...

218
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:42,483
how about...
(blows raspberry)

219
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,152
That's a lot worse.

220
00:09:44,187 --> 00:09:46,321
Can you stop
comforting me now?

221
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:49,691
Krusty, condolences
on your loss.

222
00:09:49,726 --> 00:09:52,694
So this is the Bob

223
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:57,899
whose comedic genius
I can never live up to.

224
00:09:57,934 --> 00:10:01,569
Believe me, all of us
have thought about killing him.

225
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:03,171
(sighs)

226
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:08,977
Clowns have it tough,
Krusty.

227
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:11,079
I understand.
I was Professor Pickles

228
00:10:11,114 --> 00:10:13,615
with Ringling Brothers
for several years.

229
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,350
The elephant and I
had our differences.

230
00:10:15,385 --> 00:10:16,618
So,

231
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:18,753
what brings you here?
And don't say clown car.

232
00:10:18,788 --> 00:10:21,756
I'm a sad, tragic clown.

233
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,992
Like what's his
name-- Liberace.

234
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:26,027
Tell me about
your father, huh?

235
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:30,064
Ah!

236
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,400
Herschel, did you
read your Exodus?

237
00:10:32,435 --> 00:10:34,369
Oh, uh, oh, sure.

238
00:10:34,404 --> 00:10:37,305
Really? Then tell me,
what did the burning bush say?

239
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,973
It said "Ow! Put me out!

240
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:41,442
How many talking bushes
do you think there are?!"

241
00:10:41,478 --> 00:10:42,543
(laughs)

242
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:45,146
My son, you are a
big needy nothing

243
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:46,614
that only
laughs can fill.

244
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,850
(scoffs)
I don't need laughs.

245
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:49,885
Ha.

246
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:52,120
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

247
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:54,856
A big needy nothing.
(sniffles)

248
00:10:54,891 --> 00:10:56,557
Wow. Wow.

249
00:10:56,593 --> 00:10:58,726
Krusty, would you like
a therapy dog?

250
00:10:58,762 --> 00:11:00,595
Yeah. With extra relish!

251
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,031
Hey-hey! I still
got it, huh?

252
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:05,533
Yes, if by "it"
you mean reflexive denial

253
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:06,868
of your inner sadness.

254
00:11:06,903 --> 00:11:08,236
(sadly):
Hey-hey.

255
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:09,511
SIDESHOW MEL:
<i>Shut up, children.</i>

256
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:12,407
Boys and girls, you know

257
00:11:12,442 --> 00:11:15,576
that we've been dark
for a couple of days because

258
00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:18,846
of a tragic loss
in the Krustylu family.

259
00:11:18,882 --> 00:11:20,815
Now put your hands together

260
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,751
for the man who's falling apart
before our eyes,

261
00:11:23,787 --> 00:11:26,688
Krusty the Clown!

262
00:11:26,723 --> 00:11:28,256
(kids cheering)

263
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,291
(jaunty theme music plays)

264
00:11:31,828 --> 00:11:34,595
No monologue. Roll the cartoon.

265
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,732
(swing creaking)

266
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:42,704
Oh, my God!

267
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:46,074
Who made
this monstrosity?

268
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:47,642
I did everything!

269
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:51,479
Kids, I'm experiencing
a crisis of conscience.

270
00:11:51,514 --> 00:11:53,081
(canned applause)

271
00:11:53,116 --> 00:11:54,549
No, no, no, no!

272
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:57,952
I don't deserve the prerecorded
applause of children long gone.

273
00:11:57,987 --> 00:12:00,621
(canned applause)
KID: I like Ike!

274
00:12:00,657 --> 00:12:02,957
Therefore,
I'm quitting the show.

275
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:05,259
And I know Mel
will be quitting it with me.

276
00:12:05,295 --> 00:12:07,595
Yes, yes, buy the house.
It'll be...

277
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,263
Uh, what?!

278
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:11,666
Today is the day
the pity laughter died.

279
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:13,868
Krusty the Clown has retired.

280
00:12:13,903 --> 00:12:16,404
For a brief overview
of a half-century of ha-has,

281
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:19,173
here is Channel Six
TV critic Clive Meriwether.

282
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:21,843
Krusty the Clown
will perhaps best be remembered

283
00:12:21,878 --> 00:12:25,246
for taking up two spots
in the Channel Six parking lot.

284
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:29,183
On a personal level, he used to
call me Little Lord Tingaling.

285
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:30,718
I shan't miss that.

286
00:12:30,754 --> 00:12:33,921
This man's only lasting legacies
are a law in his name

287
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:37,792
limiting the working hours
of chimpanzees to 14 hours a day

288
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:39,994
and the invention
of the payment of alimony

289
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:42,330
by dropping hot pennies
from a helicopter.

290
00:12:42,365 --> 00:12:44,332
I give his life a D-plus.

291
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:46,200
Good day to you.

292
00:12:46,236 --> 00:12:47,535
What will Krusty do now?

293
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,670
I suppose only time will tell.

294
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:51,939
Which is true
for all news stories, I guess.

295
00:12:51,975 --> 00:12:53,274
Until anyone realizes,

296
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:55,610
I'm Kent Brockman
adding no useful information.

297
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:57,612
And here's another sentence.

298
00:12:57,647 --> 00:13:00,615
You can tell I'm winding it up
because my voice is going<i> up</i>

299
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,884
and<i> down</i> like this.

300
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,854
Well, at least now
I have plenty of time

301
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,190
to solve this Rubik's Cube.

302
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:11,058
All right, what if I did...

303
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:12,860
Oh!

304
00:13:17,391 --> 00:13:18,871
(Homer snoring unevenly)

305
00:13:18,872 --> 00:13:20,360
(snoring, gasping)

306
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:21,660
(quietly):
Mom, Dad.

307
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:22,895
Yes, Lisa?

308
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,396
(snores)
What?

309
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:26,565
I've been listening,
and Dad stops breathing

310
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,067
for as long as
five minutes.

311
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:31,937
Mind if I sleep with you guys
and keep an eye on him?

312
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:34,940
Sweetie, you shouldn't have
to worry about such things.

313
00:13:34,975 --> 00:13:37,810
(gasps, snores,
wheezing)

314
00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:40,212
The doctor gave us this machine
to help him breathe

315
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:41,547
in his sleep. Go to bed.

316
00:13:41,582 --> 00:13:43,081
I'll take care of him.

317
00:13:44,218 --> 00:13:45,517
No good. No good.

318
00:13:45,553 --> 00:13:47,186
(grunting)
Oh! Ooh! Ah!

319
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:49,188
(gasping) What do I do?
What do I do?

320
00:13:49,223 --> 00:13:52,324
Oh. Breathe,
Homie, breathe.

321
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:54,359
(grunting)

322
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:09,575
Well, at least
Teeny's doing okay.

323
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,511
He's in<i> The Odd Couple</i>
with David Hyde Pierce.

324
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:15,080
Now, really, Oscar, would it
kill you to use a coaster?

325
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:18,016
(screeching)

326
00:14:18,052 --> 00:14:21,353
If you're going to go up there,
at least dust!

327
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,091
Finally, done the way
I first imagined it.

328
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:28,427
I'm gonna prove
you did groundbreaking work.

329
00:14:28,462 --> 00:14:29,962
Krusty, I want you
to binge-watch

330
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:32,030
all the shows you've ever done.

331
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:35,534
Well, I've never
said no to a binge.

332
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:36,401
(static crackles)

333
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:38,070
Deuteronomy?

334
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:40,072
Isn't that the study of deuters?

335
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:41,573
Hippocampus?

336
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:44,743
Isn't that another name for
the University of Mississippi?

337
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:46,211
Okay. I've been
on 50 years.

338
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:48,413
You're bound
to repeat yourself a little.

339
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:51,350
Unless I wanted to be sat on
by Mama Cass.

340
00:14:51,385 --> 00:14:54,586
Unless I wanted to be sat on
by Dom DeLuise.

341
00:14:54,622 --> 00:14:56,855
...by the cast of
<i>What's Happening!</i>

342
00:14:56,891 --> 00:14:59,024
...William "The Refrigerator"
Perry, everyone!

343
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:01,193
...Newman from<i> Seinfeld.</i>

344
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:03,028
...the whale from<i> Whale Rider.</i>

345
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:05,297
...Adele!
(laughs)

346
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:07,299
What? She's a guest star?!

347
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:09,268
(sobbing)

348
00:15:09,303 --> 00:15:10,702
(groans)

349
00:15:10,738 --> 00:15:12,371
(static hissing)

350
00:15:12,406 --> 00:15:16,041
So that's why all
my cameramen have PTSD.

351
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:18,277
Where's my whiskey funnel?!

352
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:20,946
(German accent):
Young man, you should go.

353
00:15:20,981 --> 00:15:24,283
When the master is like this,
it is no place for children.

354
00:15:24,318 --> 00:15:25,951
Pour, Helga!

355
00:15:25,986 --> 00:15:27,753
It begins.

356
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:30,122
(gulping)

357
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:36,495
(angelic choir singing)

358
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:40,799
Whoa. Where am I?

359
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,301
Why, you're in
Jewish Heaven.

360
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:43,635
Oh, this place is great.

361
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:45,904
Why, my necktie
straightens itself.

362
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,907
Even Portnoy has no complaints.

363
00:15:48,943 --> 00:15:51,610
And I tell you,
I get so much respect.

364
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:54,179
Wow. So I made it to Heaven.

365
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:55,747
(klezmer playing)

366
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,787
(crowd cheering)

367
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:08,694
This place is amazing!

368
00:16:08,729 --> 00:16:11,363
Schmuck,
there's no Jewish Heaven.

369
00:16:11,398 --> 00:16:13,498
Our faith teaches us
that once you're dead,

370
00:16:13,534 --> 00:16:15,834
that's it, kaput.
It's dark, it's cold.

371
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:17,502
It's like that apartment
we lived in

372
00:16:17,538 --> 00:16:19,037
before I started
doing weddings.

373
00:16:19,073 --> 00:16:21,473
But you, my son,
remain...

374
00:16:24,511 --> 00:16:26,812
Eh?!
(groans)

375
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:28,480
Go back to Earth.

376
00:16:28,515 --> 00:16:31,283
Do something with your life.
Help people.

377
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:32,951
(echoing):
<i>Help people. Help people.</i>

378
00:16:32,987 --> 00:16:34,619
<i>Help people.</i>

379
00:16:34,655 --> 00:16:36,455
Nothing. I'm not
getting a pulse.

380
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,490
(gasps)

381
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:39,291
I got to change my life!

382
00:16:39,326 --> 00:16:40,826
Still no pulse.

383
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:42,761
I guess I'm just
really bad at this.

384
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:49,920
WOMAN:
♪ Someone to watch ♪

385
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:55,091
♪ Over me. ♪

386
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:57,093
I'm afraid
Lisa's getting obsessed

387
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:58,962
with keeping her father
out of danger.

388
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:02,298
She's gotten our Resusci Annie
doll to breathe on its own.

389
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:04,801
(wheezes)
Why?

390
00:17:04,836 --> 00:17:07,237
In this new shelter,
we provide a home

391
00:17:07,272 --> 00:17:10,974
for animals put out of work
by Cirque Du Soleil.

392
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:12,642
(gorilla growls)

393
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:14,144
Um, Krusty,

394
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:16,412
have you fulfilled the promise
you made to your father

395
00:17:16,448 --> 00:17:18,915
in the dream you never
told anyone about?

396
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,250
Uh, no.

397
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:22,986
Somehow a brief act
of uncharacteristic generosity

398
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:24,654
solved nothing.

399
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:25,989
Hey, Krusty.
What?

400
00:17:26,024 --> 00:17:27,657
Have you been
going to temple?

401
00:17:27,692 --> 00:17:31,261
Yeah, and I've learned that all
religions are equally boring.

402
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:33,163
But there's a reason I went.

403
00:17:33,198 --> 00:17:34,297
Come and see.

404
00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:36,499
Kid, there's no way
you can cheer me up.

405
00:17:36,535 --> 00:17:39,502
Not when whiskey, good
deeds and hookers failed.

406
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:41,004
Who's a hooker?

407
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,008
Uh, with me, it's easier to say
which ones aren't hookers.

408
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:48,344
Hmm?

409
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,013
(grunting)

410
00:17:50,048 --> 00:17:51,514
Lisa, what are you doing?

411
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,916
Wrapping you in bubble wrap.

412
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:55,952
I can't always be around
to protect you, so it will.

413
00:17:55,987 --> 00:17:57,720
But...

414
00:17:57,756 --> 00:17:58,821
(bubble wrap popping)

415
00:17:58,857 --> 00:17:59,989
Oh, Lisa, honey,

416
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:02,492
you can't insulate yourself
from life.

417
00:18:02,527 --> 00:18:05,995
Why, I could live till 100
or a bus could hit me tomorrow.

418
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:10,166
That's why I never plan
more than four seconds ahead.

419
00:18:10,202 --> 00:18:12,368
Oh, I guess
you're right.

420
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:15,471
Now come on.
Give Daddy a hug.

421
00:18:15,507 --> 00:18:17,407
(grunting, bubble wrap popping)

422
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:19,475
Bubble wrap!

423
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:20,977
(bubble wrap popping)

424
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:23,813
Your daughterly love
saved me, sweetie.

425
00:18:23,848 --> 00:18:26,983
That's all I wanted,
a tiny bit of control.

426
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:30,053
Ooh. I suppose we should
exchange insurance information.

427
00:18:30,088 --> 00:18:31,354
I don't have any.

428
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:32,188
Me neither.

429
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:33,523
Then we have the same company.

430
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:35,558
They'll work it all out.

431
00:18:36,561 --> 00:18:38,328
(tires screeching)

432
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:42,432
(quietly):
Rabbi Rudenstein.

433
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:43,866
Your father's favorite.

434
00:18:43,902 --> 00:18:45,802
Today's reading
is from Deuteronomy,

435
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:47,937
which I believe
is the study of deuters.

436
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:49,272
(laughter)

437
00:18:49,307 --> 00:18:50,873
Hey, that's my joke.

438
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:52,609
Eh, must be
a coincidence.

439
00:18:52,644 --> 00:18:54,110
Uh, but before we begin,

440
00:18:54,145 --> 00:18:56,379
I'd like to quote
the burning bush, which said,

441
00:18:56,414 --> 00:18:57,580
"Hey, put me out.

442
00:18:57,616 --> 00:18:59,415
How many talking bushes
do you think there are?"

443
00:18:59,451 --> 00:19:00,750
Hey-hey.

444
00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:02,085
(laughter)

445
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,152
Me again.

446
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:05,922
So if Dad loved
his jokes, then...

447
00:19:05,957 --> 00:19:07,857
Dad loved my jokes.

448
00:19:07,892 --> 00:19:09,259
(crying):
Oh...

449
00:19:09,294 --> 00:19:11,794
Yeah, I guess he just
hated your delivery.

450
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,864
He loved my jokes.

451
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:18,268
My father respected me
but could never tell me.

452
00:19:18,303 --> 00:19:20,837

00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:08,885
but your show still does
really great in that key demo

(laughter)
Whoa.

467
00:20:12,457 --> 00:20:13,489
