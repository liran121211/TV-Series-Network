16
00:00:45,972 --> 00:00:48,573
This has been a bad week,
even for you, Simpson.

17
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:49,941
Concrete in the sandbox?

18
00:00:49,976 --> 00:00:51,676
I don't get lost anymore!

19
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:53,191
Spreading the rumor
that today's lunch

20
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:54,712
would be served
by a naked lady.

21
00:00:54,748 --> 00:00:56,347
Move it!
Boobs! Boobs!

22
00:00:56,383 --> 00:00:58,516
I want to see boobs in the soup!

23
00:00:58,552 --> 00:01:00,352
There is no naked lunch lady!
Bart made it up!

24
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:02,620
Yes, yes,
I-I knew that.

25
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:04,222
There's no hope
for you, Simpson.

26
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:05,723
You'll be locked
in detention

27
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:07,525
until you graduate
to the penal system.

28
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:09,194
(laughing)
Penal.

29
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:11,930
Stop laughing! I said
"penal," not "penile."

30
00:01:11,965 --> 00:01:13,932
(laughs)
Penile.

31
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:16,000
It's not like you
made me say "penis"!

32
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:18,036
(laughing)

33
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:20,438
(groaning)

34
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:37,155
Hmm.

35
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:42,360
Ow! Oh.

36
00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:44,462
Someone could get really hurt
by this.

37
00:01:44,497 --> 00:01:45,997
Stick your finger
in that desk.

38
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:47,032
Really, Bart?

39
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:49,801
Hmm, looks like ancient Aramaic.

40
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:52,136
Fortunately, I have
an app for that.

41
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:53,671
(beep)

42
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:56,374
(click, trilling, ding)

43
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:57,542
Hey!

44
00:01:57,577 --> 00:02:00,778
"He who reads
this rune translation

45
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:04,482

47
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:10,154

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,756
(hissing)

49
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,858
(alarm sounding)
SKINNER: Simpson!

50
00:02:13,893 --> 00:02:15,893
(hissing)

51
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:21,032
(both grunt)

52
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:22,400
BOTH:
Huh?

53
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:23,801
We're in Hell?!

54
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:26,004
Cool! Now I can look
up all those people

55
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,672
who said "See
you in Hell."

56
00:02:27,707 --> 00:02:29,540
Hey, pal, what are
you in here for?

57
00:02:29,576 --> 00:02:30,908
Heresies, like Docetism.

58
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:32,277
Docetism?

59
00:02:32,312 --> 00:02:34,579
The belief that Jesus' body
was just an illusion.

60
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:35,947
Is that still big?

61
00:02:35,982 --> 00:02:38,549
Haw-haw! Your heresies
were venialized

62
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:40,318
by the council
of Palermo.

63
00:02:40,353 --> 00:02:42,287
Oh, shut up,
shut up, shut up!

64
00:02:42,322 --> 00:02:44,188
(crowd chatter and groaning)

65
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:47,325
We've got millipedes,
toothheads, screaming torsos...

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,926
(screaming)

67
00:02:48,962 --> 00:02:50,695
...your bleeding eyes
with finger-legs.

68
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,697
And all the girls
are mean girls.

69
00:02:52,732 --> 00:02:54,866
Red dress,
how original.

70
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:57,368
Making fun of someone's clothes.
How original.

71
00:02:57,404 --> 00:02:59,237
Huh. You want
to walk with us?

72
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:02,974
It's true.

73
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:05,943
It would be a cold day
in Hell when I was popular.

74
00:03:08,148 --> 00:03:09,681
Huh?

75
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:11,149
Young man,
where's your Hell pass?

76
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:12,750
Skin him!

77
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:13,918
Whoa.

78
00:03:13,953 --> 00:03:15,219
(gasps)

79
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:16,587
(grunts)

80
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:17,889
Huh?

81
00:03:17,924 --> 00:03:19,357
Hmm.

82
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:21,092
So,

83
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:23,761
what would be
the appropriate eternal torture

84
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:26,097
for someone who robbed a bank?

85
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,533
(flame whooshing)

86
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:29,734
Uh...

87
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:33,371
Someone who robs a bank.

88
00:03:33,406 --> 00:03:35,606
How would you punish them
for all time?

89
00:03:35,642 --> 00:03:37,408
Mm... Jeffistopheles?

90
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:39,243
(in squeaky voice):
Uh... wh-whipping?

91
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:40,912
Okay. Good.

92
00:03:40,947 --> 00:03:42,547
No one likes to be whipped,

93
00:03:42,582 --> 00:03:45,817
but is there anything
more connected to the sin?

94
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:47,852
Torture?

95
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:50,722
What if you made the robber
eat bags of money

96
00:03:50,757 --> 00:03:52,490
until his stomach exploded?

97
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,792
Good.<i> Very</i> good.
(high-pitched whooshing)

98
00:03:54,828 --> 00:03:56,361
Mm.

99
00:03:56,396 --> 00:03:58,129
Psychological
torment.

100
00:03:58,164 --> 00:03:59,797
Pain plus fear.

101
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,367
Oh, can you all feel
how much richer that is?

102
00:04:02,402 --> 00:04:03,801
You get a pumpkin sticker.

103
00:04:03,837 --> 00:04:05,470
Ow.

104
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:07,138
(gasps)
This has never happened before.

105
00:04:07,173 --> 00:04:08,906
I have a crush on my teacher!

106
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:11,209
Down here, we can
make that happen.

107
00:04:11,244 --> 00:04:13,010
(locker door squeaks)

108
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:15,646
(both giggle)

109
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:17,715
Every time the sinner
screams in pain,

110
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:19,650
the scream blows this windmill,

111
00:04:19,686 --> 00:04:22,653
which pumps even more piranhas
into his aquarium underwear,

112
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:23,988
causing more screaming.

113
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:26,824
Wow. Wow.
Oh, that is so evil.

114
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,394
And I know evil.
I'm head of the teachers' union.

115
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:30,828
(bell ringing)

116
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:33,297
(grunting and groaning)

117
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,867
Bart, I found a portal
back to Earth.

118
00:04:37,237 --> 00:04:39,137
Right here?

119
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:40,972
No, no, no, no!
That's Super Hell!

120
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:42,774
Hot Stuff?

121
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:44,575
I didn't realize
you were that evil.

122
00:04:44,611 --> 00:04:46,577
(à la Droopy):
No, I'm being punished

123
00:04:46,613 --> 00:04:48,913
for how lame my comics were.

124
00:04:48,948 --> 00:04:50,548
(whooshing)

125
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,151
I melted it. Get it?

126
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:54,385
(crow caws)

127
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:58,055
(flames whooshing, hissing)

128
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,658
Welcome to Earth.
Local time is 10:37.

129
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:02,727
We know you have your
choice of portals,

130
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:04,729
so thank you for choosing
the Burns Hellport,

131
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:06,197
a division of
Gulf and Western.

132
00:05:06,232 --> 00:05:07,465
(Lisa pants, Bart grunts)

133
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:09,367
Mom, Dad,

134
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:11,035
I want to change schools.
Hmm?!

135
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,471
I found a place
that really wants to teach me,

136
00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:15,039
and I really want to learn.

137
00:05:15,074 --> 00:05:17,275
Homie, our prayers
have been answered.

138
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,510
Keep your pants on, Marge.

139
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:20,978
It's probably
some private school

140
00:05:21,014 --> 00:05:22,947
that costs
a million dollars a year,

141
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:24,816
and then they squeeze you
for extra money

142
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:27,084
through book fairs
and silent auctions.

143
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,620
And parents get 20 e-mails a day
from the school,

144
00:05:29,656 --> 00:05:32,223
and everyone hits
"reply all" to everything.

145
00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:34,025
Dad, it's not a
private school.

146
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,326
It's free.

147
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:37,061
Oh, that's fine then.

148
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:38,729
(man screaming)

149
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:42,066
I couldn't help noticing
this school is located in...

150
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:44,235
I'm not one
to judge, but, um...

151
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,737
I'll say it, Marge.
It's in Hell!

152
00:05:46,773 --> 00:05:49,307
The Inferno!
Perdition!

153
00:05:49,342 --> 00:05:51,409
Arizona without the golf!

154
00:05:51,444 --> 00:05:54,946
No. We do have golf,
but all the greens are tricky.

155
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:55,880
No!

156
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:57,515
Look, as educators,

157
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,152
our job is to gently nurture
your child's passion.

158
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:02,854
Hmm. That is
the kind of nonsense

159
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:04,322
you're always
falling for.

160
00:06:04,357 --> 00:06:07,325
Mom, please tell me
I can go to Hell.

161
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,661
Well, I guess
we could try it for a semester.

162
00:06:10,697 --> 00:06:13,231
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

163
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:14,765
You know,
we have many opportunities

164
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:15,933
for parent involvement.

165
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:17,401
(scoffs)

166
00:06:17,437 --> 00:06:20,238
Yeah, I'll be sure
to take a look at that.

167
00:06:22,575 --> 00:06:26,644

and none of you wants
to repeat the class

179

I don't want to embarrass.

00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:16,733
Grab my chest with
your cold, icy hands.

354
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:18,669
(moans)

355
00:15:18,704 --> 00:15:21,472
(shrieks)
The bed is lifting me!

356
00:15:21,507 --> 00:15:23,874
The elevator at work
can't even do that.

357
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:27,010
I demand you put me down
right after the sex!

358
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:29,047
D'oh!

359
00:15:29,048 --> 00:15:30,881
All right, show
yourselves

360
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,916
in the name
of this book!

361
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:35,519
D'oh! Oh.

362
00:15:35,554 --> 00:15:38,689
The power of Chrysler
compels you!

363
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,860
What are you,
cavemen?

364
00:15:42,895 --> 00:15:44,027
Turn on the lights!

365
00:15:44,063 --> 00:15:45,963
(screaming)

366
00:15:45,998 --> 00:15:48,198
Hey! A little respect!

367
00:15:48,234 --> 00:15:49,566
(grumbles)

368
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:52,703
Take a picture--
it'll last longer, man.

369
00:15:52,738 --> 00:15:55,506
Hey, if<i> you're</i> Homer
Simpson, show me your driver's license!

370
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,909
Well, I traded it to a kid
for a bite of his sandwich.

371
00:15:58,944 --> 00:16:00,377
(gasps)
He<i> is</i> me!

372
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:02,913
Noble spirits,
your time has passed.

373
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:03,814
(belches)

374
00:16:03,849 --> 00:16:05,582
That was unmotivated.

375
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:07,084
Don't have a cow, man.

376
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:10,087
Shut up!
<i>Ay, caramba!</i> (belches)

377
00:16:10,122 --> 00:16:11,655
Homer, do something!

378
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,490
Why is it always me?

379
00:16:13,526 --> 00:16:15,726
I work 12 hours a week,
you know.

380
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:18,495
She doesn't know
what a good thing she's got.

381
00:16:18,531 --> 00:16:21,064
I<i> like</i> a man
who can relax.

382
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,200
Not like Grumpy-Lumpy there.

383
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:24,768
Quit makin' cracks!

384
00:16:24,803 --> 00:16:27,004
Speaking of cracks,
pull up your pants, dude.

385
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,171
I'll crack you!

386
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:30,274
(grunting)
(chuckling)

387
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:32,609
What kind of afterlife
is this?

388
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:35,178
Can't even strangle
my dead kid.

389
00:16:35,214 --> 00:16:39,082
So yeah, things aren't perfect
with the missus and me,

390
00:16:39,118 --> 00:16:42,152
and, uh, by the way,
nice melons.

391
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:44,521
Those are
in the kitchen!

392
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:48,258
D'oh! I can't believe you
wasted our money on fruit!

393
00:16:48,294 --> 00:16:51,061
(purring)
Homer Simpson!

394
00:16:51,096 --> 00:16:53,330
Can you be more specific?
(growling)

395
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:54,531
(both chuckling)

396
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:55,799
(giggles)

397
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,167
Mmm!

398
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,170
(grumbles)

399
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:00,704
There's no reason
to be jealous.

400
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:02,306
It's just
younger you.

401
00:17:02,341 --> 00:17:05,676
Oh! So, he likes
ghosts better, eh?

402
00:17:05,711 --> 00:17:07,077
Fine.

403
00:17:07,112 --> 00:17:08,378
Hmm.

404
00:17:08,414 --> 00:17:10,914
Might as well clean this
while I'm killing myself.

405
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,149
(quiet grunting)

406
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:13,250
(grunting)

407
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:14,318
(thud)

408
00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:15,752
(humming a tune)

409
00:17:15,788 --> 00:17:16,887
Hmm?

410
00:17:16,922 --> 00:17:19,156
(chuckles):
Well, hello-ho-ho.

411
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:21,259
Aah! A ghost!

412
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,492
I<i> feel</i> like a ghost,

413
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:24,695
the way you haven't been
paying attention to me.

414
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,829
Plus, I'm dead.

415
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:27,798
Don't yell at me--
I'm a double widower.

416
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,901
But I can handle all the ghosts
you can float at me.

417
00:17:30,936 --> 00:17:33,036
Won't the other Homer
be a problem?

418
00:17:33,072 --> 00:17:35,472
Heh! I think he gets it.

419
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:37,240
See? He...
You stupid...

420
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:38,875
What the...? Ooh!

421
00:17:38,911 --> 00:17:40,978
Mmm, I smell toast.

422
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:42,479
(groans)

423
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:43,847
(whoosh)

424
00:17:43,882 --> 00:17:45,182
Well, I guess

425
00:17:45,217 --> 00:17:47,217
you and I are
in charge now, Bart.

426
00:17:47,252 --> 00:17:49,786
But if we split the chores,
I'm sure that we c...

427
00:17:49,822 --> 00:17:51,088
What are you doing?!

428
00:17:51,123 --> 00:17:52,422
Sayonara, sucker!

429
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,858
Oh, no, you're not
leaving me to clean this up!

430
00:17:54,893 --> 00:17:55,893
(yells)

431
00:17:55,894 --> 00:17:56,894
(grunts)

432
00:17:56,895 --> 00:17:58,662
(whoosh)

433
00:17:58,697 --> 00:18:01,698
Whoo-hoo! I'm the
last of the Simpsons!

434
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:03,834
In I.Q. only!

435
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:05,235
Huh?

436
00:18:06,238 --> 00:18:08,238
(grunts, coughs, groans)

437
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:11,108
GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE:
Thank you!

438
00:18:12,478 --> 00:18:14,611
Willie's got stew
for the winter.

439
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:17,114
Wait a minute--
who killed Maggie?

440
00:18:20,252 --> 00:18:23,553
This is all your fault, Homer,
for wanting somebody new.

441
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:25,889
I just wanted
the woman I married.

442
00:18:25,924 --> 00:18:28,959
I never realized you had
so much work done.

443
00:18:28,994 --> 00:18:31,962
Simpsons, please!
This fighting solves nothing!

444
00:18:31,997 --> 00:18:33,964
Dr. Marvin Monroe?!

445
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:35,632
Are you alive or dead?

446
00:18:35,668 --> 00:18:37,634
(groans) I'm in some
horrible limbo.

447
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,037
I can walk halfway through
walls, then I get stuck.

448
00:18:40,072 --> 00:18:41,805
(creaking)
Uh-oh.

449
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,574
Now I'm gonna have to look
at<i> that</i> every morning.

450
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,977
Well, I think you're
helping us make progress.

451
00:18:47,012 --> 00:18:47,778
Thank you.

452
00:18:47,813 --> 00:18:49,780
Let's not fight anymore.

453
00:18:49,815 --> 00:18:52,282
Let's just make<i> him</i>
decide between us.

454
00:18:52,317 --> 00:18:55,519
Choose me because
I'm not bitter yet,

455
00:18:55,554 --> 00:18:59,723
I can stay up later,
and you're on my mind all the time.

456
00:18:59,758 --> 00:19:03,293
Hmm, Marge number two,
how would<i> you</i> win my whoopie?

457
00:19:03,328 --> 00:19:05,796
Those are great reasons,
but there's one reason

458
00:19:05,831 --> 00:19:09,733
you should choose me: because
I know everything you've done,

459
00:19:09,768 --> 00:19:12,569
and yet I still want
to be with you.

460
00:19:12,604 --> 00:19:14,971
That is so beautiful.

461
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:16,373
(both sigh)

462
00:19:16,408 --> 00:19:19,009
You're right, Marge--
I could never leave you,

463
00:19:19,044 --> 00:19:20,343
not even for you.

464
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:22,779
If there was a dot
or a squiggle different,

465
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:24,681
that would be too much.

466
00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:26,583
Oh, Homie!
Oh, Homie!

467
00:19:26,618 --> 00:19:28,285
(all moaning)

468
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
It's time to cut
the treacle, man.

469
00:19:31,824 --> 00:19:33,857
Why, you little...!

470
00:19:33,892 --> 00:19:35,125
(birds chirping)

471
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,327
Mmm...

00:19:37,362 --> 00:19:39,262
(loud chewing,
belching continues)

00:19:40,966 --> 00:19:42,265
(whoosh)

474
00:19:43,368 --> 00:19:45,035
I just had a worrisome thought.

475
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,604
If there can be two incarnations
of the Simpsons,

476
00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:49,606
why couldn't
some evil marketing entity

477
00:19:49,641 --> 00:19:51,508
produce millions of others?

478
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:54,811
(new Homer voice): All right, Simpsons,
welcome to our new home.

479
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:58,715
Yo, yo, Santa's Little Helper
is in da house!

Okay, hold still.
