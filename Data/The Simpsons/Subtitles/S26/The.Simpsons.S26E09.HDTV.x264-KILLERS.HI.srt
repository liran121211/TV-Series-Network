D'oh!
Give me another one.

182
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,072
(groans)
D'oh!

183
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:21,174
Give me another one.

184
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,241
(groans)
D'oh!

185
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:23,476

186
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:24,710
D'oh!
Give me another one.

187
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:25,845
(groans)
D'oh!

188
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,913
Give me another one.

189
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:28,381
Oh please, stop! Stop it!

190
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,249
My religion prohibits me
from taking advantage

191
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:32,151
of a fool more
than ten times.

192
00:08:32,187 --> 00:08:34,654
This thing basically
has no winners.

193
00:08:34,689 --> 00:08:36,689
Yeah, but doesn't
the money goes to schools?

194
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,392
You have been to our schools.
What do you think?

195
00:08:39,427 --> 00:08:42,895
Welcome to Bring Us
Your Toilet Paper night.

196
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:45,097
Don't worry,
none goes to Willie.

197
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,532
Don't need it.

198
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,434
I got me Starbucks napkins!

199
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,037
You know, ironically, in
India, they did use the money

200
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,773
for schools and they
had fantastic results.

201
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:56,075
Aw, thanks
for your honesty, Apu.

202
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,443
Is there any other product
in the store

203
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:58,744
you'd like to warn me about?

204
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,112
Well, uh...

205
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:03,483
those hot dogs began
life as Twinkies.

206
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:07,854
(sizzling)

207
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:09,021
Wow.

208
00:09:09,057 --> 00:09:11,557
(pop, crackling)

209
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,693
(groans)
Christmas Eve.

210
00:09:13,728 --> 00:09:15,228
The one night a kid
wants to go to sleep

211
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,796
is the one night he can't.

212
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:18,364
I can't have another cocoa.

213
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,533
My pee is starting to
smell like a ski chalet.

214
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:22,735
(door opens)
Oh, thank God you're here.

215
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,970
I need to get to sleep.

216
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:25,404
Tell me the story
of jazz again.

217
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,040
Well, the story of jazz starts
with the tresillo,

218
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:30,376
the most prevalent
duple-pulse rhythmic cell

219
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:31,911
in sub-Saharan African music.

220
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:32,979
But the rest will have to wait.

221
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:34,914
Bart, Bart,
I hear Mom sobbing.

222
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,749
And I don't know where Dad is.

223
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,418
If it helps, I made you a card.

224
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,821
Bart, this is the year
I've got to nail Christmas.

225
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:44,457
I don't want to be a jaded
ten-year-old like you!

226
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:45,825
Ah, yes.

227
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,628
I remember Christmas Eve
when I was eight.

228
00:09:48,663 --> 00:09:50,930
MARGE: Why do you always wait
till the last minute

229
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,465
to put up the lights?

230
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,933
HOMER:
I don't want to ruin the magic.

231
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,735
And I certainly... Aah!

232
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,436
(gurgling)

233
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,005
Next year

234
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,072
this is

235
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:01,474
your job.

236
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:03,910

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,413
Ooh!

239
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:08,948
(grunting)

240
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,984
Hmm, they say a boy never
gets over seeing his dad

241
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,252
in a Santa suit getting hanged

242
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:14,787
and electrocuted
on Christmas Eve.

243
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,188
I'll help you, kid.

244
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,495
(sighs heavily)

245
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,275
Mom, I'm just a kid,

246
00:10:36,311 --> 00:10:39,045
but I say if Dad isn't
here Christmas morning,

247
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,447
that's the kind of thing
families never recover from.

248
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:43,049
Hmm.

249
00:10:43,084 --> 00:10:46,586
Lisa, sweetie,
I'm tired of being a pushover.

250
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:47,787
You're not a pushover.

251
00:10:47,822 --> 00:10:48,988
You can't smoke.

252
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,189
Just chewing
on the wood.

253
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:51,390

Eh, how you doing there?

257
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,997
Uh, your front
door was locked,

258
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,999
So, uh, rather than
call or knock,

259
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,001
I, uh, came down
your chimbley there.

260

261
00:11:04,672 --> 00:11:07,673
Moe Szyslak, you didn't
climb down our chimney

just to say
"Merry Christmas."

00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,746
Midge, it's one minute
till Christmas,

266
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:16,282
and if I'm ever gonna be
a good guy, it's now.

267
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:17,650
All right, here I go.

268
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:19,685
I'm the one that kept Homer
from coming home,

269
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,988
'cause, uh, well, I was lonely.

270
00:11:22,023 --> 00:11:23,756
(gasps)
Yeah, that's right--

271
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,157
me, Mr. Party Pants.

272
00:11:25,193 --> 00:11:28,260
So, uh, so don't hold
it against Homer, eh?

273
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:31,163
Oh, my poor Homie.

274
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,999
This is what
I was hoping for.

275
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:36,602
For it<i> not</i> to have been
<i>completely</i> his fault.

276
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:38,204
Thank you, Moe.

277
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,405
(mumbling):
Huh?

278
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,040
I'm sorry, Marge,
I'm sorry,

279
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,442
but it was Christmas, and
we were under the mistletoe.

280
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:45,077
That's lettuce caught
in a spider's web.

281
00:11:45,113 --> 00:11:46,278
All right.

282
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:47,813

to call Homer.

No answer.

Because jerk-ass Homer

My best friend is
a great runner.

360
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:04,610
I made everyone happy but me.

361
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:06,612
Some Christmas.

362

Visitor for
Abe Simpson.

367
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:27,551
You came!

368
00:15:27,586 --> 00:15:29,053
You came to see me!

369
00:15:29,088 --> 00:15:30,554
(Bart grunting)
Aw!

370
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:33,057
Easter came early
this year.

371
00:15:33,092 --> 00:15:35,059
I thought we were just
gonna ask if he'd seen Homer.

372
00:15:35,094 --> 00:15:37,561
I'm afraid we've
awoken a needy giant.

373
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:39,530
Visitors!

374
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:42,266
Let's brew some weak tea and
talk about the good ol' days!

375
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:44,868
Make them turn
the TV to CBS!

378
00:15:53,646 --> 00:15:57,047
Well, with all that you
folks have experienced,

379
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,451
I think we could enjoy listening
to a little of your wisdom.

380
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:02,886
The problem with
Puerto Ricans is...

381
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:04,755
No casual racism.

What the...?

385
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:15,299
The Nutcracker.

386
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:18,235
Every child's favorite
Christmas character.

387
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,703
Is this a dream?

388
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:21,071
Not a dream.

389
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:22,373
I work at the mall.

390
00:16:22,408 --> 00:16:24,375
And it's closed, so scram.

391
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,076
Man, you are a nutcracker.

392
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:27,611
But I've learned
something tonight--

393
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:29,046
you know how everyone hates

394
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:31,081
being with their family on Christmas?
Uh-huh.

395
00:16:31,117 --> 00:16:33,083
Well, being without them
is worse.

396
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:36,320
Can you find it in your wooden
heart to give me a break?

397
00:16:36,355 --> 00:16:38,555
All right, listen,
pal, uh...

398
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:40,557
you want to go
to a party?

400
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:57,641

doing here?

401

Well, he's not in
the neon sign store.

404
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,525
Lady, buy a sign
or go home.

405
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,360

people dressed like food?

409

Homie, I'm
your present tonight.

And the present is that
I'm not gonna always assume

424
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:09,313
that you screwed up.

425
00:18:09,348 --> 00:18:11,715
Because I realize maybe
there's a good explanation

426
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,250
for what you do.

427
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:15,486
Or a crazy one that's
pretty entertaining.

you found me!

to do that.
