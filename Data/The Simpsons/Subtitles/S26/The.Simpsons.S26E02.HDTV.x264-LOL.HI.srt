every "testicle fail"

00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,098
Now to leave a great comment.

LOL.

00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,569
That's gotta hurt.

00:01:09,604 --> 00:01:11,638
Oh... I guess there's
nothing left to do

20
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,139
but go outside and play.

A trailer for

Well, they did everything
they could to stop us,

The cereal on the
bottom gets soggy.

46
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:28,415
I know how cereal works.
Now clean your room.

47
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,850
Why should I?
It's just gonna get dirty again.

That boy has no respect

Maybe you two are more similar

We're not similar.

I love being told
what to do by someone

57
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,743
who's wise in the ways
of the world. Love it!

58
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:59,112
Here's what I would do:
in the middle of the night,

59
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,014
clean Bart's room for him,

60
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:04,351
then, in the morning,
thank him for cleaning his room.

61
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:05,785
You poor woman.

62
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,886
Dealing with Bart

63
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:08,755
has turned your mind
to ketchup water.

64
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:12,726
You rest.
I'll be the boy's father now.

65
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,196
I'm done.

66
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,765
I'd like it if you ate
a little more broccoli.

67
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,600
Eh, I'm not feelin' it.

68
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:22,602
Your mother said
eat your broccoli.

69
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:24,437
Why do I need
to eat broccoli?

70
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:27,474
So that you can grow up
healthy and strong, like...

71
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:30,410
Randy Quaid.
Yeah, Randy Quaid.

72
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:31,911
He's very healthy.

73
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,947
Look, I'll drink
another glass of milk.

74
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,283
(scoffs)
Milk. That's for babies

75
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:38,952
and old guys who can't
sleep at night

76
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,620
because of what they did
in the war.

77
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:41,955
Broccoli.

78
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:44,457
Hey, what if I eat
the broccoli?

79
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:46,793
I love the stuff.
(chuckles)

80
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:49,329
You eat a sundae.
Marge, get Lisa a sundae.

81
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:51,064
You are not
leaving this table

82
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,632
until you eat
that broccoli.

83
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:56,136
And I'm going to sit
right here until you do.

84
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,238
(scoffs)
You'll never out-sit me.

85
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,774
Oh, really? You think
your skinny butt

86
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:04,010
can sit on that hard,
wooden chair longer than

87
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:05,545
El Gordo?

88
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,414

89
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:10,383
The sit is on.

90
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:15,355
Eat your broccoli.

91
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,589
No.

92
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,291
Eat your broccoli.
No.

93
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,493
(snoring)
(alarm rings)

94
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:21,761
Read your broccoli.

95
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:23,029
No.

96
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:26,199
They've been
at it all night.

97
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,701
I know, but
they're not gonna

98
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:29,936
waste a whole
Saturday inside.

99
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,237

100
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:32,539
Mm-hmm?

101
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,974
Homer, where are you?
Our fantasy football draft

102
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,609
is about to start.

103
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:38,478
(gasps)
Today's our draft.

104
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,146
I've got to pick
a good fantasy team.

105
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:41,648
When I lost last year,

106
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:44,651
they made me do something
so humiliating...

107
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,019
Jeebus loves Tebow.

108
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,321
(Homer whimpers)

109
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,890
And so the fat man caves.

110
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:54,360
If you need me, I'll be up
in my room eating cereal.

111
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:57,630
Half a bowl of cereal.

112
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,699
Marge, I want you--

113
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:03,303
my wife-- to draft
my fantasy football team.

114
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:04,537
(all gasp)

115
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:05,839
I-I don't really

116
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,540
know that much about the...

117
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:11,010
My team name is
"Somewhere Over the Dwayne Bowe"

118
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,747
and my password
is "Annoyed Grunt."

119
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:15,715
Draft with God, honey.

120
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,917
Eat your broccoli.

121
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,656
(panting)
Martin's been secretly

122
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,291
taking self-defense
courses,

123
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,627
and now he's
beating up Nelson.

124
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,796
MARTIN: Hi-yah!
NELSON: Ow. Ow. Whoa. Aah!

125
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,998
His fat fists
are a blur.

126
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,467
I've never seen
moves like that.

127
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,136
KEARNEY:
And never will again.

128
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,605
Sounds like quite a match.

129
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,875
And here's your ticket
to a front-row seat.

130
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,376
No. No.

131
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,879
I'll never eat those
filthy mini-trees.

132
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:49,015
Today, I wear the vest.

133
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:50,483
Haw. Haw.

134
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,819
(groans)

135
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,055
Now I am never eating
that broccoli.

136
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,992
Homie. Homie,
the fantasy draft just ended.

137
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,227
I got you five kickers.

138
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:03,963
It is called football, right?

139
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:07,867
You are definitely
eating that broccoli.

140
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:16,276
(Homer and Bart growling)

141
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,880
This has got to stop.

142
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:23,550
If you don't go to work,
you're going to get fired.

143
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,652
I can get another job.
Who wouldn't want to hire

144
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,220
a man who won't back down?

145
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,822
I could be a prison warden

146
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:30,390
or a Southern anything.

147
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:32,225
I've got an idea,

148
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,760
but I'll need
that broccoli.

149
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,061
(blender whirrs)

150
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,362
These two fruit smoothies

151
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,832
look and taste exactly the same.

152
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,901
One of them, however,
has the broccoli blended in.

153
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:44,704
Bart picks one of the smoothies
and drinks it--

154
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,573
maybe he had the broccoli,
maybe he didn't.

155
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:49,509
No one knows,
so neither of you has given in,

156
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:52,212
and this horrible impasse
can come to an end.

157
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,780
Uh, works for me.

158
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:54,914
I'm in.

159
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:56,950
Oh, thank God.

160
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:58,852
Hmm...

161
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,458
Oh, no, the broccoli.

162
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,427
(annoyed grunt)
You did that on purpose!

163
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:09,762
You lick this table clean!

164
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:11,631
Come on. Lick it.
(grunting)

165
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,132

166
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,467
(both grunting)

167
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,636
Come on, now,
you can still lick it.

168
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,472
Oh, I'm afraid Homer
and Bart's problems

169
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,375
are beyond our power to solve.

170
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:26,112
There's only one thing
left to try.

171
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,147

172
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,085

(all grunt)

175
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,927
(whispers):
And, lift.

176
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,030
Put my sack back on.
I'm trying to sleep.

177
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:48,134
(both snoring)

178
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,702
(grunts)

179
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:50,904
Hmm?

180
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,439
(gasps)
(gasps)

181
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,077
Where are we?

182
00:07:58,112 --> 00:08:00,246
I don't know.

183
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:01,848
Eat your broccoli.
No.

184
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:08,804
We're on an old-time boat.

185
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:10,406
We've been kidnapped.

186
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,941
(chuckles):
Not kidnapped, shanghaied.

187
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:14,443
Oh.
Oh.

188
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:16,578
My name is
Captain Bowditch.

189
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:18,814
Your wife signed you up
for a week at sea,

190
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:21,517
where you'll live like sailors,
eat like sailors

191
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:25,487
and use therapeutic techniques
to solve father-son conflicts...

192
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:26,855
like sailors.

193
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,825
Hmm?
Hmm?

194
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:31,293
For there's no
better place

195
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:34,096
to solve relationship
issues than on...

196
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,864
<i>The Relation Ship.</i>

197
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:38,333
<i>"Relation Ship."</i>

198
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:40,669
It works two ways.
(laughs)

199
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,471
Pretty good.
(laughs)

200
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:43,972
Pretty good.

201
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:45,707
Hey, lame ass,

202
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:48,110
Thanks to you, we're stuck
on a stupid therapy boat.

203
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:49,344
I'm the lame ass?

204
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:50,846
The only lame ass on this boat

205
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,915
is you and all
the other lame asses!

206
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:55,818
(both grunting, groaning)

207
00:08:56,986 --> 00:08:58,654
Shouldn't we
do something?

208
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:00,055
We are doing
something.

209
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:01,857
We're empathizing.

210
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:08,297
I just know Bart and Homer
are best friends already.

211
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:10,165
I can feel it.
(computer dings)

212
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,900
Ooh, I'm getting a message
from your father's

213
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,535
fantasy football league.

214
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,604
I must
still be logged in as him.

215
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:20,042
Lenny used the "uck" word.

216
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:21,710
Mom, it's trash talk.

217
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:24,413
You know how guys say
mean things to their friends,

218
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:27,583
the way women say nice things
to their enemies.

219
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:30,385
Oh.
(computer dings)

220
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:37,726
Yikes!

221
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,729
Well I don't like
this trash talk.

222
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:42,664
And I'm gonna
do something about it.

223
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:45,567
Even if I have to bring in
the big guns.

224
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:48,937
Dear Lord, please help Homer's
friends understand

225
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:52,174
that make-believe
computer football is no excuse

226
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,610
for using the Internet
to be mean.

227
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:56,411
(phone buzzes)

228
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:04,052
(gasps)
Trash talk?

229
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:06,522
In church? No.

230
00:10:06,556 --> 00:10:07,856
No, not here.

231
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:09,658
(phones buzzing)

232
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,361
MARGE (gasps):
It's everywhere.

233
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:14,296
And now, a moment of silence

234
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,267
for the victims
of the Shelbyville sinkhole.

235
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:20,102
(phone buzzes)

236
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:21,904
(Marge gasps)

237
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:25,507
The WI-Fi. The WI-Fi.
I've got to take out The WI-Fi.

238
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:32,748
She's under a lot of stress.

239
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:34,616
Her husband's at sea.

240
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:36,785
(bell dinging)

241
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:39,555
Ahoy, lads and dads.

242
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:41,290
It's never easy to talk about

243
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:43,592
your feelings
in front of strangers...

244
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:45,894
so we're going to sing
about them.

245
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:48,130
♪ Who wants to sing
about their feelings ♪

246
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:50,666
♪ Who wants to go first
and sing about their feelings ♪

247
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,801
♪ I'll go first
and sing about my feelings ♪

248
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:55,804
♪ I'm so happy to be singing. ♪

249
00:10:55,838 --> 00:10:56,838
Now, Homer.

250
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:57,873
D'oh!

251
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:02,744
So, Cletus, Gitmo,

252
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:05,781
what brings you fellas
to <i>The Relation Ship?</i>

253
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:08,183
My daddy's
always overpraisin' me.

254
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:10,018
Aw, that's great honesty, son.

255
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:11,853
I'm so proud of you.

256
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:14,756
(scoffs)
Why won't you let me fail?

257
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,659
What about you,
Bart, Homer? Homer?

258
00:11:17,694 --> 00:11:19,661
Lethargy, skin spots,

259
00:11:19,696 --> 00:11:22,965
spongy gums--
this man's got scurvy.

260
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:25,334
But we've only been
at sea one day.

261
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:27,970
When's the last time
you had citrus?

262
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:31,073
I had a mimosa
at brunch a few years ago.

263
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,076
Well, Bart, while your father
spends the next few days

264
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,078
sucking out of
the lemon barrel,

265
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,948
you'll drink deep of the
hearty grog of empowerment.

266
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:41,216
What does that mean?

267
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,051
Mainly climbing.

268
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:46,555
Except for Wednesday night when
we project a movie on the sails.

269
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:48,957
But, really,
a lot of climbing.

270
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:51,960
(Gilbert and Sullivan's "We Sail
the Ocean Blue" playing)

271
00:12:22,558 --> 00:12:25,127
Sheepshank, bowline,
clove hitch...

272
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,795
(Homer sucking)

273
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,765
Dad, look, I did a round turn
with two half hitches.

274
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,533
You lie!

275
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:32,467
(gasps)

276
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,502
Wait a minute.

277
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,137
Windswept hair, rugged tan,

278
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,772
rough, calloused hands.

279
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:38,774
You're enjoying
this, aren't you?!

280
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:40,080
So what if I am?

281
00:12:40,104 --> 00:12:41,810
You're my son and you
will hate what I hate.

282
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:43,779
Angled parking. Lemons.

283
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:46,782
Kickstarters by famous guys
who already have lots of money.

284
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:48,517
And this boat!

285
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:50,952
I'm old enough to choose
my own things to hate.

286
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:52,187
And the things I like.

287
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:54,356
And I like being a sailor.

288
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,792
Betrayed by my worst enemy.

289
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:59,127
I never would have seen it
coming.

290
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:02,364
Why, Bart,
that's a perfect halyard cleat.

291
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,132
Just like you taught me,
Captain.

292
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:07,135
Over, under, over, under, over,
under, under, under, over, over,

293
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,771
over, over, over, over, over,
under, over, half hitch.

294
00:13:09,806 --> 00:13:11,846
Well, the standard form
is under, over, under, over,

295
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,341
under, under, under,
under, under,

296
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,177
over, over,
under, under, under, under,

297
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,645
around, over, over, under...

298
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,346
Fathers, sons,

299
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,616
together we've made a lot of
progress on this voyage.

300
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:23,618
I learned
that left is called "port."

301
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:26,121
I finally got over
my sea sickness.

302
00:13:26,155 --> 00:13:27,789
(retches)

303
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:30,192
Terrific, Homer. Just terrific.

304
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,962
But one sailor has truly taken
to nautical life.

305
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:38,366
I hereby award Bart Simpson
the post of midshipman.

306
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,301
(spits)

307
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:40,936
Wow.

308
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,004
So now I can give orders?

309
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,840
That's right,
Mr. Midshipman.

310
00:13:44,874 --> 00:13:46,842
Wait a minute.
I'm his father.

311
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:48,844
He can't order
me around.

312
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:50,178
He's your superior officer,

313
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:53,014
so he can and will order
you around.

314
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:55,717
And what if I refuse?

315
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,985
Oh...!

316
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:59,187
I'm sorry we had
to discipline you.

317
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:01,022
On the positive side,
you won't miss out

318
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:03,558
on the father/son
hornpipe dance.

319
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,027
(playing accordion)

320
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,099
Oh, I hate
the Golden Age of Sail.

321
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,255
(whistles)

322
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,190
Officer on deck!

323
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,795
Seaman Homer, you're supposed
to be swabbing the deck.

324
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,831
Why should I?
It's just gonna get dirty again.

325
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:28,866
I'm in charge.
You do what I say.

326
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,135
Fine. I'll swab
whatever you say.

327
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,671
Look! I'm swabbing the deck.

328
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:37,608
I'm swabbing this giant tree
that the sail grows out of.

329
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,944
Ooh! I'm swabbing
the top of the ocean.

330
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:42,780
Ooh! Swab, swab, swab...

331
00:14:42,814 --> 00:14:45,283
Hey! What the...?

332
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,852
Fantasy football has turned
every man in this town

333
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:50,621
into a trash-talking monster.

334
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,858
Oh, face it-- all men
live in a sad world

335
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:58,529
of profanity, boob jokes and
tired comedy references.

336
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:01,198
<i>Más</i> cowbell!

337
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,867
(laughter)

338
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:05,403
There's only one thing that
will shut these guys up.

339
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:08,506
You got to beat one of
them at fantasy football.

340
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,075
(dramatic, epic sports
theme music playing)

341
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:14,078
Then that's what I'm gonna do.

00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,711
That doesn't match my phone!

355
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,846
Lakwando's mind
won't be on the game.

356
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,181
And...

357
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,849
benched.

358
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:54,585
And now to make my big move.

359
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:57,421
Homer's team e-mailed asking
to start five kickers.

360
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,057
I was like, "Okay,
it's, uh, your funeral."

361
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,760
<i>There would be no funeral.</i>

362
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:07,198
<i>High winds, unlocked by the</i>
<i>savage power of climate change,</i>

363
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:11,235
<i>allowed Marge's five kickers</i>
<i>to launch a long-range campaign</i>

364
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:14,472
<i>of three-point annihilation.</i>

365
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,407
An 85-yard field goal?

366
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:18,642
You got to be kidding me!
Refresh, refresh.

367
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:22,580
<i>But no amount of refreshing</i>
<i>could alter the facts:</i>

368
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,582
<i>Despite a breathtaking</i>
<i>ignorance</i>

369
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,751
<i>and a powerful dislike</i>
<i>of the sport,</i>

370
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:31,288
<i>a rookie housewife had defeated</i>
<i>a savvy veteran,</i>

371
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,724
<i>proving conclusively</i>
<i>that fantasy football</i>

372
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,694
<i>is basically just luck.</i>

373
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,830
Ahoy, Midshipman.

374
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,266
I hope your voyage
on <i>The Relation Ship</i>

375
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,002
is proving interpersonally
fruitful.

376
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,837
I don't know. It's really hard

377
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,306
when someone
doesn't respect your authority.

378
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,975
Epiphany ho.

379
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:53,978
And I'm sure your father
has been doing some growing

380
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:55,813
and learning of his own.

381
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:59,650
♪ I found some booze
in another dad's bag ♪

382
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:01,652
♪ Drunk, drunk ♪

383
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:04,922
♪ Drunk on a boat ♪

384
00:17:04,956 --> 00:17:06,357
Yi-yo-yu!

385
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:09,360
(grunts)
You don't need booze, Homer.

386
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:13,197
I went to sea because
I'm a recovering alcoholic.

387
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:16,033
But out here on the waves,
I no longer crave

388
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:19,870
the sweet, warm,
soothing flavors

389
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:23,674
of yummy, yummy rummy.

390
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,776
(gulping)

391
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,179
I love this boat!

392
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,849
With all its pullies
and flappies and...

393
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:34,185
Everything has a name.

394
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,519
You know what, Homer?

395
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,354
I've always wanted
to eat a parrot.

396
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,858
What's the big deal?
It's just like a green chicken!

397
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:42,460
Yeah...

398
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,330
NARRATOR: <i>But fortune did not</i>
<i>favor</i> The Relation Ship,

399
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:50,334
<i>as the same winds that lofted</i>

00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:53,070

401
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:56,874

402
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:58,809
(thunder rumbling)

403
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:02,046
White lightnin' squall!

404
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,248
Why is the captain
just juggling?

405
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:06,684
Okay, o-okay.

406
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,686
I can do this. I can do this.

407
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,021
Someone count me in!

408
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,390
I said count me in!

409
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,327
Don't worry, I'll radio
the Coast Guard for help.

410
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,230
The therapy bears!
Look out for the therapy bears!

411
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,200
Oh...!

412
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:29,106
I'm a-comin', bears!

413
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,517
Don't stand there gawking
like a dang fool!

414
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,018
Do somethin', boy!

415
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:43,020
You criticized me!

416
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:45,022
That's all I
ever wanted, Daddy,

417
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:46,857
honest parenting.

418
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:47,892
CLETUS:
Aw...

419
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:52,096
Now I'm the ship's
highest-ranking officer.

420
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,565
It's up to me
to get us to shore.

421
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,270
Dad, we can make it
to harbor

422
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,939
if we can just sail
around that lighthouse.

423
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:03,774
Are you crazy?
We'll never make it!

424
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:06,043
Drop the anchor
and wait out the storm!

425
00:19:06,077 --> 00:19:08,045
No, we need to sail.

426
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,647
I'm dropping the anchor!

427
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,415
Can't you just do what I say?

428
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:13,784
You've never done
what I say-- ever!

429
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:15,419
(booming, crashing)

430
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:19,924

(gasps)

433
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:26,897
Now can we please respect
each other?

434
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,899
(booming, crashing)

435
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,135
Yes, son. We can.

436
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:35,139
Awaiting your orders,
Mr. Midshipman!

437
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:37,741
Put up the storm jib
and haul in the main sheet!

438
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,144
Aye aye, sir.

439
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:43,514
Another success story
for <i>The Relation Ship.</i>

440
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,618

441
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:53,724

(humming happily)

443
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:05,302
So, did your sailing adventure
help you work out your issues?

444
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,705
Does this answer
your question?

445
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,174
(sailor's hornpipe music plays)

446
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,947
Yar! Quite a
hornpipe Thar be.

447
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:20,284
But, uh, surely you would never
have gone on a sea adventure

448
00:20:20,318 --> 00:20:23,387
without your old friend,
the Sea Captain.

449
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,657
Yar.

450
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:29,827
That's gonna hurt
for a long time.

451
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,196
Yar.
