00:00:05,777 --> 00:00:08,182
HOMER (laughs):
Whoo! Pork chops with gravy!

3
00:00:10,262 --> 00:00:13,796
Wait. But today's
not Pork Chop Tuesday.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,015
Or Gravy Thursday!

5
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:16,478
I also set up
some mirrors

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,012
so you could watch
hockey fights while you eat.

7
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:21,050
Whoo-hoo!

8
00:00:22,484 --> 00:00:26,459
Oh, I love
Canadian-on-Canadian violence.

9
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:28,273
Oh, baby, this
is so great!

10
00:00:28,307 --> 00:00:29,445
Thank you so much.

11
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:32,118
I'm just happy<i> you're</i> happy.

12
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:36,334
Wait a minute, that's not
something people really feel.

13
00:00:36,368 --> 00:00:38,202
What's going on?

14
00:00:38,244 --> 00:00:40,305
Well, I do have a favor.

15
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:42,643
Patty and Selma came home
early from their vacation,

16
00:00:42,677 --> 00:00:45,350
but the cleaners still haven't gotten
all the black mold

17
00:00:45,384 --> 00:00:47,087
out of their apartment.

18
00:00:48,153 --> 00:00:49,191
(deep roar)

19
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:51,054
So they need a place to stay.

20
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:52,190
Here.

21
00:00:53,223 --> 00:00:55,125
(shrieks)
Paris was a bust.

22
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:57,230
They wouldn't even let
us see the<i> Mona Lisa.</i>

23
00:00:57,264 --> 00:00:59,494
They kept yelling,
<i>"La Joconde!</i>

24
00:00:59,536 --> 00:01:01,533
Her smile will die!"

25
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:02,997
No, Marge, no!

26
00:01:03,038 --> 00:01:04,804
You can't invite
a couple of Riddlers

27
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:06,468
to stay in the Bat Cave!

28
00:01:06,502 --> 00:01:09,140
You ate the food
<i>and</i> looked in the mirrors.

29
00:01:09,174 --> 00:01:10,708
They're staying!

30
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:13,741
(gruff chuckling)

31
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:15,844
(inhaling, exhaling loudly)

32
00:01:15,878 --> 00:01:18,380
(Bart and Lisa coughing)

33
00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:19,414
Hmm.

34
00:01:19,422 --> 00:01:20,653
Oh, honey,

35
00:01:20,687 --> 00:01:23,021
one teensy problem
with this plan.

36
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:24,556
I'm a teensy bit concerned

37
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,820
about them smoking
around the children.

38
00:01:26,862 --> 00:01:29,659
You know, their lungs
are so<i> teensy.</i>

39
00:01:29,693 --> 00:01:31,227
Mwah! Mwah!

40
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:33,259
Hmm. He has a point.

41
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,498
No, no. No, no, we
don't have to smoke.

42
00:01:35,532 --> 00:01:38,170
We can stop whenever
we want. See?

43
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:39,538
(hissing)

44
00:01:39,572 --> 00:01:41,506
(both grunt)

45
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,074
Okay, how about this--

46
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:45,170
if you catch us
smoking in the house,

47
00:01:45,212 --> 00:01:48,410
even one time, you can
throw us out on the street.

48
00:01:48,444 --> 00:01:51,913
You know what?
I trust them not to smoke.

49
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:55,313
And if you trust them,
I trust them, too.

50
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:58,888
(devious chuckling)

51
00:01:58,922 --> 00:02:00,288
Safety first!

52
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:02,720
Screw this.
We'll just go outside.

53
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:05,128
Nature is
God's ashtray.

54
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,624
(grunting)

55
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,464
(thunder crashes)

56
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:11,896
Bad news, bears.

57
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:14,704
Forecast calls for
nothing but rain.

58
00:02:14,738 --> 00:02:16,504
(both groaning)

59
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:18,704
(grunting)

60
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,503
(glass shatters)

61
00:02:20,545 --> 00:02:22,542
(humming)

62
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:29,748
Here we go.
Problem solved.

63
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,652
Electric cigarettes.

64
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:34,284
(loud inhaling)

65
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,420
Choke on our harmless fumes.

66
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,126
Hmm?

67
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:42,556
Well, if you
fall asleep with them,

68
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:44,396
will you even burn to death?

69
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,460
BOTH: Uh-uh.
Oh.

70
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:49,035
(loud, rapid
inhaling and exhaling)

71
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:51,731
They call these cigarettes?

72
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:54,267
They don't stain my fingers,
my hair smells like hair,

73
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:56,803
and what do I stub out
in my scrambled eggs?

74
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:59,675
Sure, it's got the nicotine,
but where's the tar?

75
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:01,508
Where's the stab
from every breath

76
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,444
that reminds me I'm alive?

77
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,116
No smoke detector!
Let's roll!

78
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,821
(both grunting)

79
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:18,599
Wait, wait.

80
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:21,631
Turn on the faucet so
no one'll get suspicious.

81
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:26,704
(explosion)

82
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:29,313
(smoke detectors beeping)

83
00:03:29,347 --> 00:03:31,513
Aha! I gotcha!

84
00:03:31,548 --> 00:03:33,818
(beeping stops) You can't resist
smoking in the house

85
00:03:33,852 --> 00:03:36,322
any more than I can resist
drinking in the car.

86
00:03:36,356 --> 00:03:37,890
What happened?
I don't know.

87
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:39,890
The water caught on fire.

88
00:03:39,924 --> 00:03:41,554
(gasps)

89
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,058
And now I banish you
from paradise.

90
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,066
I'm glad I never
bothered to learn

91
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,066
which one of you is which.

92
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,666
Please, show some compassion
for two good people

93
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,434
who just can't stop smoking.

94
00:03:53,476 --> 00:03:55,002
Hmm... hmm.

95
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:57,738
I know just the place.

96
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,978
(tires screech)

97
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:00,715
(coughing)

98
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:02,915
(both sniffing)

99
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,915
Oh!
(shudders)

100
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:06,955
Tobacco!

101
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:09,419
(both chuckling excitedly)

102
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:11,723
(loud inhaling, exhaling)

103
00:04:11,757 --> 00:04:13,724
Who needs Paris?

104
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:16,364
This is<i> our</i>
City of Lights!

105
00:04:16,398 --> 00:04:18,764
♪ ♪

106
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:25,335
Flaming tap water.

107
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:28,099
I saw something about that
in a documentary.

Yep, used to be

122
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,686
you could try
burning your water all day

123
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,118
and nothing would happen.

124
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:00,686
Henry,
did you remember

125
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,550
to turn off
the Slip 'N Slide?

128
00:05:06,296 --> 00:05:09,062
Well, I... reckon not.

129
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:11,565
I think someone is fracking
under our neighborhood.

130
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:13,460
And I know who.

131
00:05:13,502 --> 00:05:16,068
It's<i> you,</i> Mr. Texan.
Oil wasn't enough--

132
00:05:16,102 --> 00:05:19,067
now you're going after
our natural gas.

133
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:22,706
Aw, now, ain't nothing
natural about gas.

134
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,074
If you can't dance in it,
I ain't drilling for it.

135
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:28,210
I don't do this
for the money,

136
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,642
it's the dancing.

137
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:32,610
It's<i> always</i> been
the dancing.

138
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:37,153
(whooping and laughing)

139
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:42,184
(both sigh)
All right!

140
00:05:42,226 --> 00:05:44,160
BART:
<i>Oh, man.</i>

141
00:05:44,194 --> 00:05:46,328
He made us watch him dance
for three hours,

142
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:48,096
and he really
only has one move.

143
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,232
If someone was fracking
in our neighborhood,

144
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,968
wouldn't we know it?

145
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:54,768
Maybe a satellite picture
will give us a clue.

146
00:05:54,802 --> 00:05:57,640
Hmm, this is clearly
a fracking site.

147
00:05:57,674 --> 00:05:59,904
How are they
keeping people away?

148
00:05:59,938 --> 00:06:02,176
(wind whistling)

149
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,975
Aw, it's a terrific sport...

150
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:05,479
Shh!

151
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:10,951
This whole building
is just a facade

152
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:13,319
for a drilling operation.

153
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:16,087
Indeed it is.

154
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:19,424
Evergreen Terrace is built
atop a massive shale deposit.

155
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,432
Think of it--
all that poor natural gas

156
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:25,329
trapped underneath
your shanties and lean-tos.

157
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:27,969
Smithers, give these two brats
what they deserve

158
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:30,203
for sticking their noses
in my business.

159
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:32,540
(both groan)

160
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:34,109
(groans)

161
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,181
Stopping Mr. Burns
may be beyond the power

162
00:06:36,215 --> 00:06:39,517
of an eight-year-old girl with a book
report due on<i> Beezus and Ramona,</i>

163
00:06:39,551 --> 00:06:41,788
but I know someone
who can help:

164
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:45,052
<i>the first female</i>
<i>Speaker of the State Assembly,</i>

165
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:47,060
<i>a politician</i>
<i>who would never ignore</i>

166
00:06:47,094 --> 00:06:48,996
<i>a fellow environmentalist</i>
<i>in need,</i>

167
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:51,997
<i>my hero, Maxine Lombard.</i>

168
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:54,733
(gasps)

169
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,573
Charge the electric limo--
we're going to Springfield.

170
00:06:59,607 --> 00:07:00,909
What about your
cool-down period?

171
00:07:00,943 --> 00:07:02,678
What about it?!

172
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:07,245
Lisa! Motorcade!

173
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,013
Assemblywoman Lombard!

174
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:11,483
You got my e-mails!

175
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:13,819
I'll go anywhere, anytime,

176
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:16,555
to defend our precious
Bay Area values.

177
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:18,588
(gasps)
Terrible!

178
00:07:18,623 --> 00:07:20,588
Just shocking.

179
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,597
D-Does anybody have a baby
we can hold near the flames?

180
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:25,133
I guess<i> I</i> do.

181

182
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:28,566
I'm gonna hit
this Mr. Burns

183
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,869
with a politician's
most powerful weapon:

184
00:07:30,903 --> 00:07:34,206
an invitation
to a committee hearing.

185
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,847
Mr. Burns, do you admit
that you illegally pump

186
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:40,216
toxic chemicals
into the groundwater

187
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,384

188
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:43,952
(indistinct whispering)

189
00:07:43,986 --> 00:07:45,888
I... don't recall.

190
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:47,256
Mr. Burns!

191
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,791
Have you no regard
for the life and health

192
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:51,791
of your fellow human beings?

193
00:07:51,825 --> 00:07:53,432
(indistinct whispering)

194

00:07:55,298 --> 00:07:57,096
You can't drill
underneath people's homes

196
00:07:57,138 --> 00:07:58,632

197
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,871

199
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:07,238

You haven't bested me.

00:08:15,983 --> 00:08:18,749
I will find a way to
shatter that shale.

Oh, and I
suppose you do?

211
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:33,137
The planet wants to be

All you've got to do

Whoo-hoo?
I don't know,

255
00:10:23,614 --> 00:10:26,085
"fracking" is one
of those scary Lisa words.

256
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:28,549
Bah! Fracking produces
enough clean natural gas

257
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,621
to make America independent

259
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:34,720

274
00:11:06,923 --> 00:11:09,553
hydraulic fracturing
creates jobs.

275
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:11,489

And I would say...

346
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:04,168
no matter how much you try
to keep things casual,

347
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,576
someone always gets hurt.

348
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:11,375
Hmm. Well, then I must harden my
heart against such an outcome.

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,606
was never signed by...
Marge Simpson.

359
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,374
(gasps) Marge, why
didn't you sign?

360
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,181
Our water was on fire!

361
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:49,317
I'm sorry, but
the law states

362
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:52,549
that unless every single
resident sells their rights,

363
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,189
Burns can't
frack drop one!

364
00:14:55,223 --> 00:14:57,292
ALL:
Oh!

365
00:14:57,327 --> 00:14:58,724
Oh, I was counting on that money

366
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:00,156
to pay for my other
calf implant.

367
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,293
Yuck.

368
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:03,732
I already felt the pride
of energy independence.

369
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:05,963
(loud, overlapping
crowd chatter)

370
00:15:05,997 --> 00:15:08,902
Marge Simpson,
I'm as mad at you

371
00:15:08,936 --> 00:15:11,039
as you usually
are at me!

372
00:15:11,073 --> 00:15:13,376
(gasps)
Hmm!

373
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,915
(indistinct chatter)

374
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,349
(wind whistling)

375
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,085
Cheer up, Monty.

376
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,885
All you lost was money,

377
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:24,358
but what you get is... me.

378
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:29,431
(cracking)

379
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:31,198
All I lost was<i> money?</i>

380
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:32,735
(laughs)

381
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:34,839
Let me make one thing
perfectly clear.

382
00:15:34,873 --> 00:15:36,839
Our dalliance meant
nothing to me!

383
00:15:36,873 --> 00:15:39,879
You were but a sprig of parsley
garnishing my beefsteak.

384
00:15:39,913 --> 00:15:43,280
Now I cast you aside
for the busboys to gnaw upon.

385
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:46,119
Considered this ill-conceived
affair terminated!

386
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:48,783
(gasps)

387
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:50,783
(chuckling)

388
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,919
I played this just perfectly.

389
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:57,308
Oh, yeah, great.
Great, Marge, great work.

390
00:15:57,309 --> 00:16:00,643
Thanks to you, Springfield will
never be a natural gas boomtown,

391
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:04,644
and like all boomtowns,
it would have lasted forever.

392
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:08,211
Oh! Our water was on fire!

393
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:11,787
Oh!<i> Was</i> on fire.<i> Was!</i>

394
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:13,923
I finally got a job
I was good at,

395
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:17,289
and now I have to give it up!

396
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:20,256
So, you've come begging
not to be fired?

397
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:22,391
Smithers, turn my back
on this man!

398
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:24,897
Maximum huff!

399
00:16:24,931 --> 00:16:27,265
Wait, Mr. Burns.
I'm here to man up.

400
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:28,937
It was all
my wife's fault!

401
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:30,433
(sighs heavily)

402
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:32,937
Sometimes I think she and I
have nothing in common!

403
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:35,776
Nothing in common,
eh? Tell me more.

404
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,304
Marge likes sushi.

405
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:39,441
I like gum that
squirts in your mouth.

406
00:16:39,482 --> 00:16:41,113
She's into romantic comedies.

407
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:42,577
I like movies where there's only

408
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:44,849
one day a year
when murder is legal.

409
00:16:44,883 --> 00:16:48,185
Yup, Marge and I see the world
in totally different ways.

410
00:16:48,219 --> 00:16:49,984
Hmm. Different, exactly.

411
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:53,088
That's why I had to give
my woman the old heave-ho.

412
00:16:53,122 --> 00:16:55,496
So, you don't miss
that politics lady at all?

413
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,160
Not for one
Chinese second.

414
00:16:57,194 --> 00:16:59,465
And I'm sure
she's forgotten all about me.

415
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,601
(both gasp)

416
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:04,169
Killdozers.

417
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:05,802
Whatever are you doing, man?!

418
00:17:05,843 --> 00:17:07,977
We're tearing down this place
and putting up

419
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:09,706
a recycling center,

420
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:11,977
slash Native American
history museum,

421
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:13,610
slash condor
sanctuary.

422
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:15,283
(screeching)

423
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:18,389
Hmm. A project this bloated
and ill thought out

424
00:17:18,423 --> 00:17:20,357
could only be the work
of an angry liberal.

425
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:22,125
(gasps)
Maxine!

426
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:24,726
My ex is using the thing
I hate most against me--

427
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,198
big government.

428
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:27,535
(grunts)

429
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:29,200
(camera shutter clicking)

430
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:30,673
Stop this
ribbon cutting!

431
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:32,370
This is private property!

432
00:17:32,412 --> 00:17:34,242
What's the matter,
Mr. Burns?

433
00:17:34,276 --> 00:17:36,714
Never heard
of eminent domain?

434
00:17:36,748 --> 00:17:39,210
You're just doing this to get
back at me for dumping you!

435
00:17:39,252 --> 00:17:41,682
That is ridiculous.

436
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,524
(gasps)

437
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:48,829
The Antonin Scalia bedroom!

438
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:52,062
It's a National Public Radio
broadcast center now.

439
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:53,735
Who are you?

440
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:56,735
I'm Robert Siegel, and this is
<i>All Things Considered.</i>

441
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:59,135
(theme music playing)

442
00:18:05,114 --> 00:18:07,048
Stop laying about, you!

443
00:18:07,082 --> 00:18:08,352
There's work to be done!

444
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:10,448
(weakly):
Or Gravy Thursday.

445
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,424
If that woman thinks
she's been scorned now,

446
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,824
she ain't seen nothing yet!

447
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,634
(clacking)

448
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:26,801
It's fracking time.

449
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:28,769
(squeaking)

450
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:31,040
(whooshing)

451
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:34,143
(rumbling)

452
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:36,143
(groaning)

453
00:18:36,177 --> 00:18:38,311
(Bart groaning)

454
00:18:38,345 --> 00:18:40,350
(grunts)

455
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:43,046
(groans)

456
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:47,253
Is one of the side effects
of fracking earthquakes?

457
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:49,157
(voice shaking):
Yes!

458
00:18:49,191 --> 00:18:51,356
(rumbling continues)

459
00:18:52,694 --> 00:18:54,493
What are you doing?

460
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:56,429
You're destroying
this neighborhood.

461
00:18:56,463 --> 00:18:59,103
Just like
you destroyed my mansion.

462
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:03,471
I don't know what I ever saw in
you, you planet-ruining monster!

463
00:19:03,505 --> 00:19:06,839
Likewise,
you planet-saving succubus!

464
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:08,975
(metallic rattling)

465
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:13,015
Homer, turn off
that horrible machine!

466
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:15,687
You don't know anything
about hydraulic fracturing!

467
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,423
You've just been brainwashed
by liberal TV shows

468
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:21,119
who use fracking
as an easy bad guy,

469
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,623
but it can save this country!

470
00:19:23,657 --> 00:19:26,263
Our... water... was...

471
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:28,632
on... fire!

472
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,631
Wait. I finally get
what you're saying.

473
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:34,838
Fracking<i> is</i> great,
but the only place

474
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:38,902
it should ever happen
is in other people's towns!

475
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,374
Hmm.

476
00:19:40,408 --> 00:19:41,974
(grunting)

477
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,384
(whooshing)

478
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,456
(grunting nervously)

479
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:02,432
You always do
the right thing... sort of.

480
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,632
What is he doing?

481
00:20:05,674 --> 00:20:07,754
He was furious at that woman,
now he's embracing her.

482
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,976
He told me himself
they had nothing in common.

483
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,040
Nothing except passion.

484
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:14,208
Mm.
(cracking)

485
00:20:14,242 --> 00:20:15,911
(hearts beating)

486
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:18,247
I was a fool
to break up with you, Maxine.

487
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:21,183
I'm sorry I turned your home
into a liberal paradise.

488
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:24,022
You think we could
make<i> us</i> work?

489
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,518
I don't know.
We're pretty different.

490
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,222
But we've got passion,
and as long as we've got that,

491
00:20:29,256 --> 00:20:32,191
our lives will never
get boring.

492
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:34,296
Mmm.

493
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:37,336
Well, there's free
jazz on Saturdays

494
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:38,904
at the art museum.

495
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:42,516
Now they say omega-3 pills
are bad for you.

496
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:45,955
My sister's dog
had puppies.

497
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:48,794
What kind?
What kind of what?

498
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,795
What kind of dog
does your sister have?

499
00:20:53,346 --> 00:20:55,408
I don't know.

500
00:20:55,442 --> 00:21:01,942
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

501
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:09,261
What color drawer
pulls did you want?

502
00:21:09,285 --> 00:21:10,824
Nickel or brush nickel?

503
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:15,436
Oh, I wish we'd bought the more
expensive theater tickets.

504
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,444
I'll never see anything
in row BB.

505
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:24,317
There's a sale on lawn
furniture at the Lawns Plus.

506
00:21:27,908 --> 00:21:30,610
Why are all cars
black or gray now?

507
00:21:30,644 --> 00:21:33,450
It's like if you see
a red one, it's a big deal.

508
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:39,519
I'm thinking about
wearing a watch again.

509
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:47,921
Shh!
