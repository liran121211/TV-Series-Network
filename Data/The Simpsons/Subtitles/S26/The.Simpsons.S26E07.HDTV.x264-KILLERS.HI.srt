00:00:01,299 --> 00:00:02,766
KODOS: You and your
stupid makeup.

2
00:00:02,927 --> 00:00:04,426
We missed Halloween!

3
00:00:06,937 --> 00:00:08,470
D'oh!

4
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:09,507
(tires screeching)

5
00:00:09,508 --> 00:00:11,141
(grunts)

6
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:14,644
Ooh!

10
00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:33,596
CHALMERS:
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>

11
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:36,166
I'd like to welcome
all of the principals

12
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:38,368
from the Springfield
School District,

13
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:40,336
including Skin-ner!

14
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:41,638
Wein-berg!

15
00:00:41,673 --> 00:00:43,273
Sack-ett!

16
00:00:43,308 --> 00:00:47,110
And Gwendolyn
Hertz-feld-Mastroantonio!

17
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:50,146
We are here for the annual
Dance of the Lemons,

18
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:51,948
where each of you gets to trade

19
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:54,017
your worst teacher
to another school.

20
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:56,519
The union's happy,
the parents are placated,

21
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:58,888
and only the children suffer.

22
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:00,790
(over video, whispering):
Chalmskinn.

23
00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:02,826
Behold your lemons!

24
00:01:02,861 --> 00:01:06,729
Sociopathic child haters
who are only teachers

25
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:09,666
because they got tenure
after two short years.

26
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:11,167
That's mean!

27
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:12,969
You know what you are.

28
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:14,204
(Taser buzzing)

29
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,805
Uh, first lemon:

30
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:20,043
from Springfield Elementary,
going to West Springfield,

31
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:23,746
third grade teacher,
Sticky-Fingers Stella.

32
00:01:28,086 --> 00:01:31,354
Now, going to
Springfield Elementary...

33
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:33,356
God have mercy.

34
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:36,226
Seymour, your new teacher is...

35
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:37,694
Everybody pray!

36
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:39,329
This is
a public school.

37
00:01:39,364 --> 00:01:40,597
I said pray!

38
00:01:43,902 --> 00:01:47,770
Mr. Lassen is here.

39
00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:49,272
No smoking.

40
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:53,209
So, Mr. Lassen,

41
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:55,879
you began your career
at Shelbyville Prep.

42
00:01:55,914 --> 00:01:58,381
It seems that certain
wealthy parents didn't like

43
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:01,384
seeing their precious darlings
duct-taped to the wall.

44
00:02:01,419 --> 00:02:04,287
Mm-hmm. And then you entered
the public system.

45
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:06,589
That's where I got this scar.

46
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,258
What scar?

47
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:13,696
Oh, I see you're left-handed.

48
00:02:13,732 --> 00:02:15,565
So, that concludes
my evaluation.

49
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,900
Enjoy fourth grade.

50
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:20,303
So, any dirt
on the new teacher?

51
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:22,872
Is he stingy with
the pumpkin stickers?

52
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:25,108
Does he have OCD?
OCD? OCD?

53
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:27,043
I don't know.

54
00:02:27,078 --> 00:02:30,280
But in ten minutes, I'm gonna
have him kneeling before Zod.

55
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:32,916
In this example, I'm Zod.

56
00:02:34,486 --> 00:02:36,119
(thumping)

57
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:38,154
When he opens the door...

58
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,093
That's kind of scary,

59
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:46,496
but it doesn't make me
pee my pants.

60
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:48,064
Hello.

61
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:50,333
(screams)

62
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:52,602
I'm Mr. Lassen.

63
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:54,904
You mean Mr. Less-than?

64
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,072
(students giggle)

65
00:02:56,107 --> 00:02:58,608
So, a comedian, are you?

66
00:02:58,643 --> 00:03:00,777
I got a pretty solid
ten minutes.

67
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:03,980
Well, I could do five minutes
on your pathetic vest

68
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:06,182
and five minutes
on your ugly buck teeth.

69
00:03:06,217 --> 00:03:08,251
And I've got a whole
HBO special's worth

70
00:03:08,286 --> 00:03:09,986
on your fat mama!

71
00:03:10,021 --> 00:03:13,289
My mom can't afford to be fat--
she's an exotic dancer.

72
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:14,791
(chuckling):
Oh!

73
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:18,294
And in what exotic
location does she dance?

74
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,495
A Touch of Class.

75
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:20,964
But the "C-L" fell off.

76
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:23,166
Son, there was
never a "C-L."

77
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:25,535
I-I think I always knew that!

78
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,703
(sobbing)

79
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:28,037
Bart, this guy served

80
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:30,106
two tours in middle school.

81
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:31,608
Abort prank!

82
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:32,809
I will not.

83
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:34,944
Anything to delay
a spelling test.

84
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,412
(thumping)

85
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:44,187
Looks like I've got
a prankster on my hands.

86
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:46,222
(chuckles)
You know, son,

87
00:03:46,257 --> 00:03:48,458
school code says
a student's hair

88
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:51,327
should be of
uniform length.

89
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:52,562
What are you gonna do to him?

90
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:54,731
Quiet... Smellson.

91
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:58,067
Smellson? I prayed no one
would ever think of that!

92
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:01,537
(razor buzzing)

93
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:03,673
<i>Ay, caramba.</i>

94
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,875
How was your first day
at school, Bart?

95
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,143
Terrible.

96
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:08,811
You want to talk about it?
No.

97
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:10,146
Oh, thank you.

98
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:12,148
Why are you wearing
your hat at dinner?

99
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:14,517
This new teacher I got
gave me a haircut.

100
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:16,319
Hmm?
A haircut? Let me see.

101
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:18,254
No.
Come on. Please?

102
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:20,189
No, you'll laugh at me.

103
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:21,924
I won't laugh at you.
Let's see.

104
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:25,828
(laughing)

105
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:28,331
Look at me. I'm Bart.

106
00:04:28,366 --> 00:04:29,732
We're sorry.

107
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:32,201
(laughing)

108
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:35,304
(laughing)

109
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:38,541
Stop that,
all of you.

110
00:04:38,576 --> 00:04:40,943
It's not Bart's fault that
his haircut looks so stupid.

111
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,003
(Homer giggles)

112
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:44,415
I didn't know that a teacher
could cut kids' hair.

113
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,783
Teachers' union won the right
in their last strike.

114
00:04:46,818 --> 00:04:50,753
I'm going to go to that school
and talk to that teacher.

115
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:52,422
Marge, please don't
say anything.

116
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:53,856
It never makes a difference,

117
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:55,858
and then the teachers
give us stink-eye

118
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:57,927
during the school fairs.

119
00:04:57,962 --> 00:04:59,562
Well, if he's gonna get
a haircut,

120
00:04:59,597 --> 00:05:02,565
Bart should at least
have gotten a balloon with it.

121
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,700
(groans)

122
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:05,234
(grumbles)
Well, anyway, Bart,

123
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,438
you'll cheer up on our
camping trip this weekend.

124
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:09,706
What camping trip?

125
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:12,575
The one you booked
for us at Owl Haven.

126
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,112
The one you have to
reserve a year in advance.

127
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:20,616
Oh, uh, you told me not to do it
a year ago. Remember?

128
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:21,918
I don't remember that.

129
00:05:21,953 --> 00:05:23,920
You're right.
No one can be expected

130
00:05:23,955 --> 00:05:26,089
to remember something
from a year ago.

131
00:05:26,124 --> 00:05:28,391
Certainly not me.
Pass the gravy.

132
00:05:28,426 --> 00:05:31,594
(gasps) Don't tell me
you didn't reserve a campsite.

133
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:35,098
Labor Day is next weekend.
There'll be nothing left.

134
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:37,333
Hey, there's always room
at Buzzard's Roost.

135
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:40,837
Excuse me, but Buzzard's Roost
is a converted parking lot.

136
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:44,107
Excuse me, but grass
is poking through.

137
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:46,175
Why do I ever put you in charge
Parking lot!

138
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:47,443
of the littlest thing?
Poking through!

139
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:48,578
(crying)
Parking lot!

140
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:49,746
Poking through!

141
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:52,148
My biggest sin
is that I dare to hope.

142
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:53,616
(crying)

143
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:56,452
Oh, Marge, I can't stand it
when you cry at dinner.

144
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:58,287
The pork chops look traumatized.

145
00:05:58,323 --> 00:06:00,289
The mashed potatoes
can't stand to watch.

146
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:02,492
Even the children seem upset.

147
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:06,329
So trust me, I will come through
for you, baby.

148
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:08,765
Not you.

149
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:11,334
So what do you say, Marge?

150
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:14,003
I want so much to believe you.

151
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:16,439
And I want you
to believe me, too.

152
00:06:16,474 --> 00:06:18,975
Isn't it great
how much we agree?

153
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,382
Looks like our blackboard
has been defaced.

154
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:28,818
Lucky for you,
I can take a joke.

155
00:06:28,853 --> 00:06:30,653
(grunting)

156
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:32,121
LISA:
Hello?

157
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:33,523
Hello? Is
everything okay?

158
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:35,958
Here's... Millie!

159
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:38,995
Excuse me, you
ruined my report.

160
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,563
Fine. You got an "A."

161
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:43,299
Oh! Yippee!
Fourth-grade "A"!

162
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:46,469
You might fool some people,
El Barto, but not me.

163
00:06:46,504 --> 00:06:47,637
(electrical buzzing)

164
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:50,406
Now we're gonna learn
about electricity.

165
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:52,542
Hey, live wire.
Come up here.

166
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:54,277
Touch the generator.

167
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:58,981
Even I think
this is too far.

168
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:00,550
Quiet, Smellson.

169
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:02,485
It's sticking.

170
00:07:03,922 --> 00:07:05,788
(grunting)

171
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:11,394
I just need
to get to 60%.

172
00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:16,213
Milhouse, I'm gonna
get back at Lassen.

173
00:07:16,248 --> 00:07:17,547
Now,<i> The Hobbit</i> taught us

174
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,549
that every dragon has
a chink in its armor.

175
00:07:19,585 --> 00:07:21,184
It also taught us

176
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,253
that New Zealand's
beautiful landscapes

177
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:25,088
and attractive
tax credits

178
00:07:25,124 --> 00:07:27,758
add up to a
filmmaker's paradise.

179

180
00:07:33,532 --> 00:07:34,731
To find out
Lassen's weakness,

181
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:36,500
I hid a camera in
the teachers' lounge.

182
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:43,974
(grunting)

183
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:46,343
Ach! Wrong order!

184
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:52,783
You seem lonely
and kind of weird.

185
00:07:52,818 --> 00:07:54,551
You left out "single."

186
00:07:54,586 --> 00:07:56,386
Mind if I heat up
some goulash?

187
00:07:56,422 --> 00:07:59,656
Let's continue this
online.

188
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,894
I've created a fake
Ms. Hoover profile.

189
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:07,230
When Lassen friends her, we'll
know everything about<i> him.</i>

190
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:08,732
I don't know, Bart.

191
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:10,734
You're lying
about your identity?

192
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:12,736
That's against
the terms and conditions.

193
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:16,173
We've all read the terms
and conditions, Milhouse.

194
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,175
Look, I really need a campsite.

195
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,610
My wife is making sandwiches.

196
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:23,280
Sorry, reservations
are a year in advance.

197
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:25,349
What about Mosquito Cove?
Booked.

198
00:08:25,384 --> 00:08:28,352
Skunk Canyon?
Booked every year since 2003.

199
00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:30,821
Ooh, how about the campsite
where the guy in the hockey mask

200
00:08:30,856 --> 00:08:32,089
kills all the campers?

201
00:08:32,124 --> 00:08:34,124
Sir, that's a movie.

202
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:38,428
Hello? Hello?
This is Homer Simpson.

203
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:40,430
742 Evergreen Terrace.

204
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,899
Looking for a place
for my kids and me.

205
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:44,501
And my pretty, pretty wife.

206
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:47,371
You know, alarm code 3679.

207
00:08:47,406 --> 00:08:49,406
3679!

208
00:08:50,576 --> 00:08:53,543
So I hear you're
getting back at Lassen.

209
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:55,712
Maybe I am. So?

210
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:59,216
You got to do it, man.
He preys on the weak.

211
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:01,518
Now, give me
your lunch money.

212
00:09:01,553 --> 00:09:03,854
I'll take that.
(whimpers)

213
00:09:05,357 --> 00:09:06,656
(cat screeches)

214
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:09,593
Here's Lassen's profile.

215
00:09:09,628 --> 00:09:12,329
MILHOUSE:
What the...?

216
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:14,498
BART:
Tagged as Lassen?

217
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:15,832
(groans)

218
00:09:15,868 --> 00:09:19,236
It says these were taken
at Blazing Guy.

219
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:21,238
What's Blazing Guy?

220
00:09:21,273 --> 00:09:23,340
Oh, that's convenient.

221
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,075
Helloha.

222
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,512
Do you want to make your home
in a self-sustaining city

223
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:31,748
that only exists
a few days a year?

224
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:34,751
<i>One that combines nudity,</i>
<i>dust storms,</i>

225
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:38,388
<i>children</i>
<i>and all-consuming fires?</i>

226
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:40,891
Then you, my bro or brah,

227
00:09:40,926 --> 00:09:44,161
are dreaming of Blazing Guy.

228
00:09:44,196 --> 00:09:46,163
On the last day,

229
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:48,498
<i>the chosen one, or Ignis,</i>

230
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:52,169
<i>sets fire</i>
<i>to the giant wooden Guy</i>

231
00:09:52,204 --> 00:09:56,540
<i>in a ritual dating back</i>
<i>to 1986.</i>

232
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,542
The Blazing Guy Council
of Elders,

233
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:00,277
in conjunction with Duraflame,

234
00:10:00,312 --> 00:10:02,112
is very pleased to announce

235
00:10:02,147 --> 00:10:05,749
that this year's Ignis
is Jack Lassen.

236
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:06,784
(both gasp)

237
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:08,585
So if we go there
with a camera

238
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,886
to film Lassen
humiliating himself,

239
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:12,088
I'll get revenge for
him making me into this.

240
00:10:12,124 --> 00:10:13,924
(chuckles)

241
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,525
I was trying
to even it out.

242
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:17,761
You're starting
to look like your dad.

243
00:10:17,796 --> 00:10:19,196
No.

244
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:22,499
I'm lucky.
I look just like my mom.

245
00:10:23,702 --> 00:10:27,204
(grunting)

246
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:30,807
Gosh, that was a hard
sleeping bag to roll up.

247
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:32,809
Those were
your father's sweatpants.

248
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:34,911
(sighs)
Marge,

249
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:37,247
I have a confession to make
about this trip.

250
00:10:37,282 --> 00:10:38,582
(quietly):
Dad, don't worry.

251
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:40,217
I got you a place.

252
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:41,618
Hmm? Once again,

253
00:10:41,653 --> 00:10:43,653
I've been saved
from any consequences.

254
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:45,322
It'll keep happening
till one day

255
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:48,925
I create a mess so enormous
it can't be cleaned up.

256
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:50,494
Thanks, boy.

(Homer laughing)

265
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:20,690
Homer Simpson,
I love you.

266
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:25,662
Oh.

267
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:30,867
(gasps) A world of anarchic
free expression.

268
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:33,169
Cars shaped like cupcakes!

269
00:11:33,205 --> 00:11:34,971
I'm home.
I'm home.

270
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:36,273
(gasps)

271
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:38,642
No, no, no, don't
blow me out, wise guy.

272
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:40,210
Not in the mood.

273
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:45,601
(groans)

274
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:54,243
I'm not sure this campground
is family-friendly.

275
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,945
All camping is pointless.

276
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,214
You drive hundreds
of miles to shower and sleep

277
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:01,050
in a place with
no bathroom or beds.

278
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:03,920
I guess what I'm trying
to say is: Where's Maggie?

279
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:05,655
(groans, screams)

280
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,491
We brought
Cheerios for you.

281
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,796
Now, you know the wind
does kick up here.

282
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:16,332
Hope you went three feet down
with your tent stakes.

283
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:19,602
Uh, listen here,
Desert Arnaz.

284
00:12:19,637 --> 00:12:22,872
Homer Simpson knows
how to pitch a tent.

285
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:27,744
Hey man,
can I bum a tent?

286
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:28,779
(groans)

287
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:30,246
You seem stressed.

288
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:32,081
Have some calming tea.

289
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:35,018
Finally. A normal person.

290
00:12:35,053 --> 00:12:37,620
Ah. Thank you, Miss, um...

291
00:12:37,655 --> 00:12:40,656
Calypso Self-Knowledge.

292
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:43,826
Is that tea... adulterated?

293
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:46,496
Does that look like
something I'd do?

294
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:49,832
HOMER:
Hey, Marge.

295
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:53,870
We got a new tent
from a guy who just O.D.'d.

296
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:57,340
Aw, let me get
a picture of that.

297
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,075
(alarm whooping)
(cell phone chimes)

298
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:02,145
BOTH:
Aw.

299
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,280
I think Smitty's
still inside.

300
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:05,982
Oh, too bad
he's missing this.

301
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:08,384
So many musical choices.

302
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,852
A brass band.

303
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:11,788
Barbershop<i> quintet?</i>

304
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:13,356
The human kazoo.

305
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:15,892
Oh, a drum circle.

306
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:17,360
(rhythmic drumming)

307
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:27,737
(peppy tooting)

308
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:34,744
Uh... can I help you, freak?

309
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:36,746
No.

310
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:38,781
(plays a sad tune)

311
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,919
BART:
There he is.

312
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:46,155
(gasps) His nipples
are asymmetrical.

313
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:47,824
This could ruin him.

314
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:49,759
Milhouse, everyone here
is a total freak.

315
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:52,695
We have to find a way
to completely humiliate Lassen.

316
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,598
Get a picture of a
restaurant check with no tip,

317
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:57,767
put it online,
say it was him.

318
00:13:57,802 --> 00:13:59,435
Kaboom, he's finished.

319
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:05,141
Mmm.

320
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,946
Oh.

321
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:12,682
Suddenly this place

322
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:15,051
doesn't seem so bad.

323
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:16,552
This place is great.

324
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:19,122
Just have to avoid these
inseam-high cactuses.

325
00:14:19,157 --> 00:14:20,723
Hup, hup.

326
00:14:20,758 --> 00:14:22,391
D'oh!

327
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:26,195
Oh. Are you Mr. Clean?

328
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:29,098
(scoffs) Compared to the rest
of these people, yeah.

329
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,434
So give the Tooth Fairy
my forwarding address,

330
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:33,703
'cause it's pretty loose.

331
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:36,372
About time.
It's the only phone.

332
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:38,441
You don't count.

333
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:42,879
Maybe we should just
give up on Lassen.

334
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:45,248
No. This Ignis thing is
the biggest deal of his life.

335
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:46,582
And I'm gonna wreck it.

336
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:49,085
Because he scarred me forever.

337
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,987
Hey, it grew back.

338
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:52,388
A little better, even.

339
00:14:52,423 --> 00:14:54,123
So full and lush.

340
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,458
Enough.

341
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:57,293
Mmm.

342
00:14:57,328 --> 00:14:58,995
It's like someone ironed out

343
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,465
all the wrinkles in my brain.

344
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,900
(gasps)

345
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,935
(upbeat tune plays)

346
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:33,529
(wind whistling)

347
00:15:34,832 --> 00:15:37,466
Get in the tent.

348
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:45,141
D'oh!

349
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:49,879
Oh, you always
save me,

350
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:51,814
trombone elephant.

351
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:54,650
(imitates elephant)

352
00:15:58,122 --> 00:16:00,022
Hmm.

353
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:01,424
BART:
Fire retardant?

354
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:06,829
If Lassen can't light
that thing, he'll be humiliated.

355
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:09,799
What good is an Ignis
who can't blaze the guy?

356
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:11,467
I'm scared, Bart.

357
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:13,402
And I am never scared.

358
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:15,738
(gasps)

359
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:17,273
Hideous.

360
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:30,553
(loud beeping)

361
00:16:30,588 --> 00:16:32,555
These kids are gonna
ruin the ceremony.

362
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,590
It's too bad
I'm just an illusion.

363
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:45,501
Homie,
you promised me

364
00:16:45,536 --> 00:16:47,503
an incredible
camping trip,

365
00:16:47,538 --> 00:16:49,038
and I got one.

366
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:50,873
Just like I planned.

367
00:16:50,908 --> 00:16:53,509
You got very lucky this time.

368
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:55,111
Don't push it.

369
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:56,579
I understand.

370
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:59,415
I already signed up
for this place next year.

371
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:03,252
I gave my form
and $200 cash to that dude.

372
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,121
D'oh!

373
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:07,623
(drums, saxophone,
kazoo playing)

374
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:13,396
Ignis, approach the Burning Man.

375
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:15,931
I mean Blazing Guy.

376
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:29,845
(crowd groaning)

377
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:34,016
Get the job done.

378
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,618
You're not helping.

379
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,291
(crowd boos, hisses)

380
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,660
Strip him of his nudity.

381
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:51,867
(laughing)

382
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,406
You.
(both gasp)

383
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:59,141
Maybe we won't have Blazing Guy,

384
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:00,743
but we can still have...

385
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:02,611
blazing boy.

386
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:03,979
What, uh...

387
00:18:04,015 --> 00:18:06,482
(tooting)
(screaming)

388
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:13,489
Help me, desert weirdos.

389
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:15,658
(both gasp)

390
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:17,226
I'll take those.

391
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:23,699
Beware the butterfly's
sting.

392
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,468
What the...?

393
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:26,569
(creaks)

394
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:31,807
Form a human prison

395
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:34,877
and hold him for five days.

396
00:18:38,182 --> 00:18:40,549
No.
(grunts)

397
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:42,551
Wait, how
many days?

398
00:18:42,587 --> 00:18:44,954
(laughing)

399
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:46,822
Hey, listen, we should
probably get home.

400
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:48,324
My dad forgot
to bring water.

401
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,592
(smacks tongue)

402
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,532
Whoa. When will this tea
get out of my system?

403
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:00,069
(upbeat tune plays)

404
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:14,550
Haw-haw!

405
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,953
What the...?

406
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,172
According to this file from
Blazing Guy Secret Security,

407
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:26,274
your behavior was so egregious

408
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:29,177
we can do something
that we've never done before:

409
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:30,545
fire a teacher.

410
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,580
Hand in your red pen.

411
00:19:36,286 --> 00:19:39,354
Oh. Not gonna pass
fingernail inspection tonight.

412
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:40,855
So where do you go
from here?

413
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:43,458
A place where my talents
will be appreciated.

414
00:19:43,493 --> 00:19:45,493
All right, lights out.

415
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:50,432
You, too, freak.

416
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:52,434
(groans)

417
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:54,269
You hate him, too?

418
00:19:54,304 --> 00:19:57,439
With every fiber of what's left
of my wretched soul.

419
00:19:57,474 --> 00:19:59,641
We should team up.
I can get you out of here.

420
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:02,856
A partner? Intriguing.
Who gets to gut him

421
00:20:02,856 --> 00:20:04,287
like a little
pot-bellied salmon?

422
00:20:04,668 --> 00:20:06,452
I assumed we'd take turns.

423
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:07,556
No deal.

424
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:14,156

425
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,730
Shh!
