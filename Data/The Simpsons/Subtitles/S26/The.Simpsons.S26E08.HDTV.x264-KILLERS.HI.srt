Oh, come on, Szyslak.

18
00:00:44,385 --> 00:00:47,186
I got to make space in the store
for my new side business--

19
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:50,656
a tanning salon that secretly
has cameras in the beds,

20
00:00:50,692 --> 00:00:55,161
which feeds into my Web site,
www.tancams.com.

23
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:00,466

to rent your own Dumpster.

to play guitar.

then call it a day?

184
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:28,362
APU:
Excuse me,

185
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:31,265
but my wife told me about
your get-out-of-the-house band.

186
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,567
And, uh,
perhaps you need a singer?

187
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:36,170
Oh, yeah, Apu,

188
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,038
I'm sure you're
a great singer.

189
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:41,408
But the balance of the band
is really delicate right now,

190
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:45,279
and we're not really looking
for a world music vibe.

191
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:47,081
No disrespect to world music.

192
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:49,116
I love world music.

193
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:51,385
No, no, I will sing
the classic power ballad

194
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,054
"Hopin' for a Dream"
by my favorite band

195
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,657
from the 1980s, Sungazer.

196
00:07:57,693 --> 00:07:59,126
(clears throat)

197
00:07:59,161 --> 00:08:00,260

That sounds nothing
like terrible,

00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,713
terrible world music.

204
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,583
Why is your voice different
when you sing?

205
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:25,753
It is because of all the years
I spent at the Kwik-E-Mart...

206
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:27,154
(rock song playing)

207
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:29,189
<i>...where classic rock anthems</i>

00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,162

211
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:39,833

00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:58,419
Guys, are you feeling this?

220
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,920
Are you feeling this?

221
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:01,221
I'm feeling it.

222
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:02,556
I'm definitely
feeling it.

223
00:09:02,591 --> 00:09:05,359
I felt something earlier,
but I was afraid to bring it up.

224
00:09:05,394 --> 00:09:07,461
I think we all
felt something.

225
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:09,396
We are more than just
a garage band

226
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:11,912
desperate to do anything other
than hang out with our families.

227
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:14,501
We are now a cover band.

228
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:16,103
And we shall be called...

229
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,371
Covercraft.

230
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:20,974
Because we play covers
and this is our craft.

231
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,710
And it sounds
like Hovercraft.

232
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:24,211
That was not my intent.

233
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:26,480
Okay, Covercraft, hands in.

234
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:27,715
Cover...

235
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,949
ALL:
Craft!

(instruments tuning)

239
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:53,941
Okay, this crowd is
about to experience

240
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:56,143
the special magic
of the cover band,

241
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,045
the thrill of live music

242
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,314
without the fear
of hearing anything new.

243
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,415
Hmm?

244
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,683
(sighs)

245
00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:04,551
Apu, what's wrong?

246
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:06,420
What if, what if
I am no good?

247
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:08,622
This is the
Cabbage Festival, man.

248
00:10:08,657 --> 00:10:10,958
I-I don't know if
I can face that crowd!

249

(groans)

250
00:10:12,294 --> 00:10:14,128
Buddy, buddy.
Think of it this way:

251
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:16,764
you're not singing
in front of all those people,

252
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,599
you're alone
at the Kwik-E-Mart

253
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:20,134
in the middle of the night.

254
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,002
You just wear this onstage,

255
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:24,071
and everything will be fine.

256
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:25,839

My uniform!

257
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:33,447

You could become
a famous rock star!

270
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:16,924
Well, son,

271
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,158
I do have the talent.

272
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:20,127
My mind is full of ideas

273
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:22,262
for great songs I could write...

274
00:11:22,298 --> 00:11:24,565
down the names of
and then cover.

275
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,099
But then I remember:

276
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:29,203
I'm just a regular guy,
jamming with my buds.

277
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:30,571
Oh, sweetie.

278
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,140
This band has brought out
the best in you.

279
00:11:33,175 --> 00:11:36,043
Yeah, you really get that
it's all about the music.

280
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:37,144
Yep.

281
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:38,712
It's all about the music.

282
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:41,615
And it would take a pretty
unforeseen development

283
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,116
to change that.

284
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:46,220
Pretty unforeseen...

285
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:52,793
Gentlemen, I think we've found
what we're looking for.

286
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:58,532
HOMER: <i>Guys, I really need</i>

the pocket?

KIRK: Freddy Freeman,
Shredder Stevens,

291
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:09,710
Nick Delacourt and
Peter D'Abbruzio--

292
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:13,113
you're four of the five guys
from Sungazer!

293
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:16,283
But where's your lead
singer, Grant LeDavid?

294
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,885
Uh, he passed away.

295
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,920
How?

296
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:20,454
(whispering)

297
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,823
What kind of erotic
asphyxiation?

298
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:23,858
(whispering)

299
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:24,892
Oh...

300
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:26,894
Apu, you're
the only man

301
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:28,295
on the entire
Internet

302
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,964
who's got the pure
Sungazer sound.

303
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,566
Will you be our
new lead singer

304
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,568
and join us on
our stadium tour?

305
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:35,469
Uh...
Oh! Ooh.

306
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,138
I think I can
answer for Apu.

307
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:39,339
He's flattered,

308
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,375
but the small-time
success of Covercraft

309
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,477
is all that any of us
have ever wanted.

310
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,945
Uh, actually, I...

311
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,881
Apu has a rich life
here in Springfield:

312
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:49,816
a store full of
great products,

313
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,685
a lovely
him-type wife,

314
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,420
and eight super kids:

315
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:56,523
Anoop, Sandeep,
Nabendu, Gheet,

316
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:59,259
Pria, Uma,
Poonam, Sashi...

317
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:00,460
Shut your mouth,
I want to do it!

318
00:13:00,496 --> 00:13:01,595
I want to do it!

319
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,598
I want to be a singer

00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:05,633
SHREDDER STEVENS:

ALL:
...gazer!

322
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,905
Gotta say, I'm
kind of jealous

323
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:13,907
of Apu getting
a break like that.

324
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:15,142
Not me.

325
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:16,677
I'm nothing but happy

326
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,346
that our friend is headed
for fame and fortune.

327
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,848
APU:
Tonight we play Las Vegas--

328
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,018
and the theme of
the casino is circus!

329
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,486
Circus!

330
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:28,155
Ha!

331
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,523
(whimpers)

332
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,658
I want his fame
and fortune so much!

333
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:35,128
Why must the Lords
of Rock be so cruel?!

334
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:37,831
(laughing)

335
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:39,232
Sammy Hagar?

336
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:40,834
You're not dead.

337
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:43,603
Damn it!

338
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,639
I told you those jalapeño
poppers had too much breading!

339
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:47,207
Sorry,
Señor Hagar.

340
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:48,875
Nah, nah, nah,
it's cool, man.

341
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,644
I went to rock star heaven.

342
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:54,548
And there was this great back
patio with this sweet fire pit.

343
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,351
If you had the right
wristband-- which I did.

344
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:58,585
(laughs)

345
00:13:59,694 --> 00:14:02,715

357
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,106

00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,816
Dad, you shouldn't
be jealous of Apu.

361
00:14:37,851 --> 00:14:40,085
Remember, it's all
about the music.

362
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,152
I'm not jealous.

363
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:42,454
I'm envious.

364
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:43,688
Jealousy is
when you worry

365
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:45,156
someone will take
what you have.

366
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:47,125
Envy is wanting
what someone else has.

367
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,561
What I feel is envy.

368
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:50,962
Hmm.

369
00:14:50,998 --> 00:14:52,397
Wow, he's
right.

370
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:53,432
You know what?

371
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:55,066
Apu leaving is
the best thing

372
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,342
that ever happened
to this band.

373
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,203
We're gonna be
like Genesis

374
00:14:58,238 --> 00:15:00,272
after Peter Gabriel left.

375
00:15:00,307 --> 00:15:02,474
You mean more popular
but not as good?

376
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:05,176
Phil Collins-era Genesis
is not as good, huh?

377
00:15:05,212 --> 00:15:07,512
"No Reply at All,"
"Land of Confusion,"

378
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:09,681
"Throwing it All Away,"
"Illegal Alien,"

379
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:13,285
"I Can't Dance," and I'm sure
I don't need to mention...

380
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,787
"Invisible Touch"!

381
00:15:15,822 --> 00:15:16,822
Hmph!

382
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:20,892
(Covercraft plays)

383
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:26,898
(grunts)

384
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:30,569
You know, we really could
use a new lead singer.

385
00:15:30,604 --> 00:15:32,904
You know, I've been
known to sing a little.

386
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,674
What? So you can also get
famous and bail on us?

387
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:36,808
You're out of the band!

388
00:15:36,843 --> 00:15:39,210
Well, you can't
just kick him out.

389
00:15:39,246 --> 00:15:42,047
Oh, so you're sticking
up for Yoko here?

390
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:44,983
Looks like I've got
another Yoko on my hands.

391
00:15:45,018 --> 00:15:46,885
How can there be two Yokos?

392
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,486
Yoko! Yoko!

393
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:49,821
Yoko! Yoko! Yoko!

394
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:52,324
All you Yokos
are out of the band!

395
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,359
(grumbling)

396
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:01,733
Are you okay?

397
00:16:01,768 --> 00:16:03,168
Do I sound okay?

398
00:16:03,203 --> 00:16:04,736
You sound great!

399
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:07,839
Your licks are really... juicy.

400
00:16:07,874 --> 00:16:09,941
They're not juicy.
My licks are dry.

401
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:11,843
Dry and scratchy
like a cat's tongue.

402
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:13,345
You didn't join a band

403
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,780
to become famous like
in<i> Almost Famous.</i>

404
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:17,816
You loved playing music
with your friends.

405
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,584
That was enough
to make you happy.

406
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,453
Well, it's not enough anymore.

407
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:23,688
When something great
happens to one person,

408
00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:25,790
everyone else's life
gets a little worse.

409
00:16:25,826 --> 00:16:27,692
Look it up, it's called physics.

410
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:29,427
Apu is a good man.

411
00:16:29,463 --> 00:16:32,697
He sent over front row tickets
and backstage passes

412
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:35,033
to his show at
the Costington Center.

413
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:37,435
Oh, you mean he
generously invited us

414
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:39,337
to come watch him
be a rock star?

415
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,573
Stop feeling
sorry for yourself.

416
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:43,842
Your friend had a wonderful
thing happen to him,

417
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:47,112
and you are coming with us
to share in his talent.

418
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:49,080
I'll never have
a per Diem.

419
00:16:49,116 --> 00:16:51,149
You don't know
what a per Diem is.

420
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:52,217
Still want one.

421
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:55,521
Hmph.

422
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:06,866
Hmph.

423
00:17:09,036 --> 00:17:10,036
Hmph.

424
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:14,105
Apu wouldn't be able
to sing a note

425
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:16,207
if I didn't help him get
over his stage fright

426
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,109
with his Kwik-E-Mart shirt.

427
00:17:18,145 --> 00:17:19,210
(gasps)

428
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,812
Backstage pass,

429
00:17:20,847 --> 00:17:24,215
you just became
a payback rage pass.

430
00:17:34,661 --> 00:17:36,895
Look at all this rock star
dressing room stuff.

431
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,229
What a sellout.

432
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,664
Cheese plate...

433
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,900
oh, sorry,<i> cubed</i> cheese plate.

434
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,737
Lemon tea, probably
for his throat.

435
00:17:45,772 --> 00:17:47,238
Mm-hmm!

436
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,607
Let's see how he performs

437
00:17:49,643 --> 00:17:51,142
in front of all those people

438
00:17:51,178 --> 00:17:54,112
without his magic-people-
performing-in-front-of shirt.

439
00:17:55,215 --> 00:17:56,815
(door opens, Homer gasps)

440
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,050
But, Mr. Shredder,
you promised me

441
00:17:59,086 --> 00:18:01,653
after we played my hometown
I could have a day off.

442
00:18:01,688 --> 00:18:03,655
I also promised
I'd kick heroin.

443
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,823
Hmm?

444
00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:07,192
But the tour is
so hard on my family.

445
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:08,660
My octuplets are being raised

446
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:10,328
by roadies and bodyguards.

447
00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:12,497
This is
not proper.

448
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:13,665
Look, Apu.

449
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,767
For 25 years
we wasted money

450
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:17,469
on women, drugs

451
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:19,804
and guitars with
live fish inside.

452
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,040
And now we want
to keep it going.

453
00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:24,375
You signed a contract
for a three-year,

454
00:18:24,411 --> 00:18:27,078
57-country tour
at union scale--

455
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:28,680
no per Diem.

456
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:29,447
(gasps softly)

457
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,382
You're in the band.

458
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,020
Oh, well, I guess it's showtime.

459
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:37,288
(gasps)

460
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,423
Homer?

461
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,691
I'm sorry, Apu.

462
00:18:39,726 --> 00:18:41,092
I thought you were
living your dream life,

463
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:42,827
so naturally
I wanted to ruin it.

464
00:18:42,863 --> 00:18:44,929
But now I know things stink,

465
00:18:44,965 --> 00:18:47,031
so I'm okay with it.

466
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:48,433
Oh, what is
the point?

467
00:18:48,468 --> 00:18:51,503
I am trapped like a Kwik-E-Mart
hot dog on a roller.

468
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:54,139
Kwik-E-Mart hot dog, eh?

469
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,241
You want every hot dog
in the store?

470
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:57,442
Every one?

471
00:18:57,477 --> 00:18:58,843
Okay...

472
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:11,289
- Yeah! - Yeah.
- Oh!  -Yeah!

473
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:13,525
FORUM ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

474
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,361
Tucks Medicated Pads presents...

475
00:19:16,396 --> 00:19:18,196
Sungazer!

476
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:20,832
(cheering) Yeah!
All right!

477
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:23,335
Uh, people?

478
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:24,836
I am sorry to report

479
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:27,172
that all the original
members of the band

480
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,640
have been struck down

481
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:31,376
by a mysterious case
of hot dog poisoning.

482
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:32,477
(groaning)

483
00:19:32,512 --> 00:19:34,245
Rather than refund your money

484
00:19:34,281 --> 00:19:35,880
or reschedule the show,

485
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,549
we have a surprise for you.

486
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:39,951
Get ready to rock with a group

487
00:19:39,986 --> 00:19:43,788

508
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,879
So there I am, on Easter Island,

509
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,948
and the heads ask me
to play them a song.

510
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:50,883
I say, "Why me, heads?

511
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:53,419
You've heard the music
of the universe itself."

512
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:54,887
And they say, "Sammy,

513
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,856
your stuff rocks
just a little harder."

514
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,524
That's when I wake up.

515
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:00,893
I'm in the Springfield
Elementary parking lot,

516
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:04,397
doing a buck fifty-five
in my Ferrari 512 Boxer.

517
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,765
I was cornering so hard,

518
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,400
I blacked out
from the Gs, man.

519
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,669
They say I ran over
the groundskeeper.

520
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:11,404
Probably get life in prison.

521
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:12,738
But I got a plan to escape,

522
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:14,407
using only this harmonica

523
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,409
and some guitar picks
with my face on 'em.

524
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,444
Who's with me on this?

525
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,940
(Hagar laughing)
