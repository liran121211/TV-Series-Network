LISA: Dad!

30
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,901
Remember how you said
that going to

31
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,278
Itchy & Scratchy Land
would be too damned expensive?

32
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,365
Oh everything's too damn
expensive these days.

33
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,409
Look at this Bible
I just got-- 15 bucks.

34
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,537
And talk about
a preachy book.

35
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,581
Everybody's a sinner,
except for this guy.

36
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,083
But now
Itchy & Scratchy Land

37
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,960
is cutting ticket
prices in half.

38
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,087
Can we go, Dad?
Can we, can we, can we?

39
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,463
-Take it, Lis.
-Can we?

40
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,882
No, no, no, no, no.
Ask your mother.

41
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,676
BOTH: Yay!

42
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,719
Mom, guess what?

43
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,139
We're going to
Itchy & Scratchy Land.

44
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,682
No.

45
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,183
I've already planned
our vacation.

46
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,395
We're going to the
Highway 9 Bird Sanctuary.

47
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,356
I understand they've installed
a new bird feeder this year.

48
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,277
It's shaped like a diner

49
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,280
and it's on this
really tall pole.

50
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,579
Mom, Dad, Bart's dead!

51
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,705
(both gasping)

52
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,373
That's right--

53
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,625
dead serious about going
to Itchy & Scratchy Land.

54
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,960
(both groaning)

55
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,336
You know,

56
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,880
Itchy & Scratchy Land
isn't just for kids.

57
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,382
They have a place
called Parents' Island.

58
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,717
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,594
"Yeah, dancing, bowling,
fashionable shops

60
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,762
"over 100 bars and saloons

61
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,807
and a world-class
chemical dependency center."

62
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,560
TV Town! Hammock Land!

63
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,354
Oh, recipe-related
bumper cars.

64
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,149
(both gasping)

65
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,358
BOTH: Yay!

66
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,735
Wait a minute.

67
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,653
I'm not sure
about this.

68
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,113
Every time
we've ever gone on vacation,

69
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,199
I end up being
horribly embarrassed.

70
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,658
We end up in a big fight,

71
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,077
and we come home more miserable
than when we left.

72
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,287
You have to promise me that

73
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,122
this isn't gonna happen
this time.

74
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,916
Embarrassed?
What are you talking about?

75
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,877
Well, there was our trip
to the Amish Country.

76
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,463
Oh, yes.

77
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,340
(laughing)
Hey look, Marge,

78
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,091
they're still
not fighting back.

79
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,843
(grunts)
Hee-hee.

80
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,137
I can be a jerk
and no one can stop me.

81
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,764
Hee-hee-hee-- Ahh!

82
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,934
MARGE: <i>Even worse was</i>
<i>our trip to Sandy Beach.</i>

83
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:49,520
(all screaming)

84
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,231
(laughing)

85
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,607
Suckers.

86
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,608
(laughing)

87
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,692
(screaming)

88
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,569
Shark Boy!

89
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,658
This year I want us to do things
together as a family

90
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,660
and get a lot
of good exercise outdoors

91
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,495
so we'll have a lot
of wonderful memories

92
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,537
of our vacation.

93
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,789
Don't worry, Mom.

94
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,540
We'll make you
proud of us.

95
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,751
Lobster hat,
fishnet Speedo Junior,

96
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:16,005
wheelie shoes,
invisible dog leash.

97
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,424
(laughs)
Well, I'm packed.

98
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,134
MARGE: And remember,
every morning,

99
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,512
give one bowl of kibble
to Santa's Little Helper.

100
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,222
Do you want me to write
any of this down?

101
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:27,183
No. I ain't senile,
dad-blasted!

102
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,685
-Okay, bye-bye.
-Bye.

103
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,103
LISA: Bye, Grandpa!

104
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,229
Wait a minute.

105
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,730
What was that last thing
you said?

106
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,774
Grandpa's little helper?

107
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,985
What's that?

108
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,529
Which one of you
is the mailman?

109
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,700
Okay, let's make a pact.

110
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,743
This is gonna be
the best vacation ever

111
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,955
or we'll all agree to disband
and join other families.

112
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,164
ALL: Agreed.

113
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,709
HOMER: Ah, the interstate.

114
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,502
Fasten your seat belts, kids.

115
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,505
We're on our way
to Itchy & Scratchy Land!

116
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,507
ALL: D'oh!

117
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,009
Don't worry.

118
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,469
I've got an ace
up my sleeve.

119
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,805
(honking)

120
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,142
(gasping)

121
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,154
Dad, can we stop
at Flickey's?

122
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,488
No.

123
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,580
Oh, my God, what'll I do?
What'll I do?!

124
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,165
What's the matter
with you, Homer?

125
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,543
We don't have any fruits
or vegetables in the car.

126
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,837
The whole trunk's
full of them, Marge.

127
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,800
You got any fruits
or vegetables?

128
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:46,262
(panicky scream)

129
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,265
Hey. Mr. Wimbley,
it happened again.

130
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,184
Now to absorb
some local color

131
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,853
through the magic
of A.M. radio.

132
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,813
MAN (on radio):
<i>The Book of Revelations</i>

133
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,233
<i>tells us to watch for</i>
<i>the seven signs of evil...</i>

134
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,819
MAN 2:
<i>...sign of evil number four.</i>

135
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,489
MAN 3: <i>Continuing our</i>
<i>"sign of evil" countdown</i>

136
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,240
<i>here's Vanessa Williams.</i>

137
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,914
Aw, haven't we stood in five
different states long enough?

138
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:13,915
No.

139
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,631
(yawning)

140
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,425
(yawning)

141
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,261
We better find a motel
and stop for the night.

142
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,930
We don't need
to do that, Marge.

143
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,307
I'm not tired.
I'm not tired at all.

144
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,143
(tires screeching)

145
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,563
Ooh, glad that wasn't us.

146
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,693
North... south...

147
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,986
Ah, nuts to this.

148
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,822
I'm going to take
a shortcut.

149
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,281
Homer, no.
You're going to get lost.

150
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,991
Trust me, Marge.

151
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,661
With today's modern cars,
you can't get lost--

152
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,038
what, with all
the silicon chips and such.

153
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,092
All right, we're here.

154
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,052
Let us never speak
of the shortcut again.

155
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,180
HOMER: Now remember,
we're in the Itchy lot.

156
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,603
PILOT: <i>We're now approaching</i>
<i>our final destination.</i>

157
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,355
<i>Itchy & Scratchy Land--</i>

158
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,648
The amusement park
of the future

159
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,358
where nothing
can possi-blye go wrong.

160
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,070
Possibly go wrong.

161
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,865
Huh. That's the first thing
that's ever gone wrong.

162
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,878
(kids laughing)

163
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,926
One adult
and four children.

164
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,970
Would you like to buy some
Itchy & Scratchy Money?

165
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,347
-What's that?
-It's money that's made just for the park.

166
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,974
It works just like
regular money,

167
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,642
but it's, uh... fun.

168
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,353
-Do it, Dad.
-Well, okay, if it's fun.

169
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,230
Let's see...

170
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,815
I'll take $1,100 worth.

171
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,653
(groans)

172
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,411
-Ha, cool!
-Wow!

173
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,412
Neat-o!

174
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,748
Such a violent motif.

175
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,500
Yeah, but it's just
pretend violence

176
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,627
which is actually
beneficial for children.

177
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,253
-Ow!
-Ow!

178

00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,876
Elementary chaos theory
tells us that all robots

358
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,628
will eventually turn
against their masters

359
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,673
and run amok in an orgy
of blood and kicking

360
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,383
and the biting
with the metal teeth

361
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,760
and the hurting and shoving.

362
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,970
How much time do we have,
Professor?

363
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,181
Well, according to
my calculations,

364
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,642
the robots won't go berserk
for at least 24 hours.

365
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,643
(groaning)

366
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,316
Oh, I forgot to carry the one.

367
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,817
I have nothing
to say to you.

368
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,236
But Marge, I was
a political prisoner.

369
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,072
How were you
a political prisoner?

370
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,365
I kicked a giant mouse
in the butt!

371
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,825
Do I have to draw you
a diagram?

372
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,497
Oh, for gosh sakes,
what now?

373
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,256
Hey, look.

374
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,634
This one's coming on to me.

375
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,094
Yoo-hoo!

376
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,096
Mr. Robot.

377
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,395
Dad, I think you're
wrong about that robot

378
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,480
trying to be your friend.

379
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,148
Lisa, don't...

380
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,525
contradict...
your... elders.

381
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,111
Ah! My hair!

382
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,029
You chopped off my hair.

383
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,739
Oh, God, I'm ugly.

384
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,283
I knew we should have gone
to the bird sanctuary.

385
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,785
(chirping and twittering)

386
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,831
(screaming)

387
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:48,043
I need the biggest seed bell
you have.

388
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,087
No, that's too big.

389
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,799
A chopper! We're saved.

390
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,177
Hey, you're the guys
who didn't like our capering.

391
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,139
When you get to hell,
tell them Itchy sent you.

392
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,431
(grunts)

393
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,937
Oh, my.
It looks like we're doomed.

394
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,773
Back, you robots!

395
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,901
Nobody ruins
my family vacation but me

396
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,486
and maybe the boy.

397
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,321
(grunting)

398
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,409
(grunting continues)

399
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,709
(screaming)

400
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,670
(all screaming)

401
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,924
Dad! The flash must have
scrambled their circuits.

402
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,676
What are you,
the narrator?

403
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,387
Ahh! Just keep taking pictures.

404
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,430
(clicking)

405
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,890
I'll get more cameras.

406
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,895
Smashy-smashy.

407
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,189
I don't approve of that.

408
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,360
(screaming)

409
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,030
Hey, mouse...

410
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,865
say cheese.

411
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,284
With a dry, cool wit
like that

412
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,785
I could be an action hero.

413
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,163
-(cameras clicking)
-(groaning)

414
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,216
Die, bad robots, die!

415
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,884
With a dry, cool wit
like that I could be--

416
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,219
Who would have thought

417
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,595
that our visit to
Itchy & Scratchy Land

418
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,181
would turn out to be
our best vacation ever?

419
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,807
Yeah, best ever.

420
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,186
Are you two bonkers?
We almost got killed.

421
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,521
Not to mention all
the embarrassment I suffered.

422
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,441
But, Mom, it's exactly what
you wanted in a vacation.

423
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,276
It brought us
together as a family.

424
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,570
We got a lot
of good exercise outdoors,

425
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,614
and we have so many memories.

426
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,990
You know you're right.

427
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,618
This truly was the best
vacation ever.

428
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,827
Now let us never
speak of it again.

429
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,748
As Roger Meyers, Jr.,
the owner of the park,

430
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,918
I'd like to thank you for
stopping the killer robots,

431
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,671
and to show my appreciation,
here are two free passes.

432
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,964
But there are five of us.

433
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,465
(louder)
Here are two free passes.

434
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,800
That's better.

435
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,843
Man, if this is happening here,

436
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,845
I'd hate to think
what's happening

437
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,889
in Euro Itchy & Scratchy Land.

438
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,019
(French accent)
Hello!

439
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,605
Itchy & Scratchy Land
open for business.

440
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,733
Who are you to resist it, eh?

441
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,068
Come on.

442
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,611
My last paycheck bounced.

443
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,614
My children need wine.

444
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,284
(yelling in French)

445
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,370
(Lisa and Bart laughing)

446
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,249
I hope you realize now

447
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,167
that violence on TV
may be funny,

448
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,836
but it's not so funny

449
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,087
when that violence
is happening to you.

450
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,130
But it would
be funny to someone

451
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,548
who was watching us.

452
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,675
-(soft growl)
-No, Mom, he's right.

453
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,427
Observe.

454
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,636
Ow!

455
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,887
(laughs)

456
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,889
(all laughing)

457
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,974
Oh, my.

458
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,600
Lisa, go to your room.

459
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,727
