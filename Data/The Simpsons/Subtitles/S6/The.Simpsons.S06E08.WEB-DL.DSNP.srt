You will receive one as soon
as your grades start to slip

00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,315
"Beat up Martin."

-Bah!
-Oh!

00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,656

first academic alert--

71
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,283
Wiggum, Ralph.

72
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,202

73
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,580
No, no, Ralph.

74
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,123
This means you're
failing English.

75
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,541
Me, fail English?

76
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,543
That's unpossible.

77
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,961
Muntz, Nelson.

78
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,463

79
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,923

80
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,341
you're doing quite well
in Home Ec.

81
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,426

82
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,928

84
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,347

86
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,099

88
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,187
I'm smart and a teacher's pet.

89
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,232

90
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,026

about this warning.

you try harder.

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,084
HOMER: Whoo,

95
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,045
And I'm so proud you
didn't try to forge my name.

96
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,797
How about
a present, son?

97
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,132
Well, I could use a new pair
of hockey skates.

98
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,217
Done and done.

99
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,510
LISA: That's not fair.

100
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,387
Why is Bart getting a present

101
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,638
and I'm getting chewed out?

102
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,932

TEACHER:
Tell you what, Simpson.

104
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,810
I won't fail you

105
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,019
if you join one
of those peewee teams

106
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,729
outside the school.

107
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,356
You mean those leagues
where parents push their kids

108
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,358
into vicious competition
to compensate

109
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,610
for their own
failed dreams of glory?

110
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,529
Look, I don't need this.

111
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,490
I inhaled my favorite whistle
this morning.

112
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,164
D'oh, d'oh, d'oh, d'oh

120
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,272

121
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,857

Wow, Bart, I'm so impressed

154
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,923
you were able to give Milhouse 
a concussion.

155

Oh, you're just jealous

156
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,594

skills would transfer over

161

162
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,899
Well, only one way to be sure.

175

if the Bible has taught us
nothing else--

176
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,014
and it hasn't--

177
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,433
it's that girls should
stick to girls' sports

178
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,393
such as hot-oil
wrestling,

179
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,645
foxy boxing
and such and such.

180
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,398
I think women should be able
to play any sport men play,

181
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,817
but hockey is so violent
and dangerous.

182
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,445
Look at Milhouse's teeth.

183
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,071
Mom, will you stop
showing us those?

184
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,365
I have to join the team,
or I'll get an "F"

185
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,367
that will haunt me
for the rest of my life.

186
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,331
I now pronounce you
president of these United--

187
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,749
MAN: Stop the inauguration!

188
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,918
I just discovered
our president-elect

189
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,920
got an "F"
in second grade gym class.

190
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,129
(all gasp)

191
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,964
In that case,
I sentence you

192
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,510
to a lifetime of horror
on Monster Island.

193
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,386
Don't worry.
It's just a name.

194
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,389
(screeching)

195
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,016
(panting)

196
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,519
He said...
it was just a name.

197
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,937
What he meant is
that Monster Island

198
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,523
is actually a peninsula.

199
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,899
(shuddering)

200
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,067
(knocking)

201
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,944
Do you have my teeth?

202
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,614
No.

203
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,494
Okay, hotshots,

204
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,246
now that my daughter
is on your team,

205
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,498
I want to make
a few things clear.

206
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,625
Please, Dad,
I'll be fine.

207
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,293
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

208
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,837
I don't want anyone
to give her a hard time

209
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,297
just because she's different.

210
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,258
No jokes, no taunting.

211
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,926
(guffaws)

212
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,595
Look, that kid's got bosoms!
Who's got a wet towel?

213
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,099
Come here,
you butterball.

214
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,433
Don't make me run!

215
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,851
I'm full of chocolate.

216
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,399
(yells)

217
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,984
Whoa!
(shrieks)

218
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,819
(laughing)

219
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,195
I can't even watch.

220
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,196
I don't know how
you two can sit here

221
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,906
laughing at poor Lisa

222
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,242
while she's out there
probably scared to death.

223
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,327
We're laughing
with her, Marge.

224
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,704
There's a big difference.

225
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,038
LISA:
(shrieking) Whoa!

226
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,040
(laughing loudly)

227
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,877
With her.

228
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,213
You really think I did okay
out there, Mom?

229
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,048
Absolutely, honey.

230
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,884
By blocking the net, I really
think you helped your team.

231
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,305
Okay, little buddy, hop in.

232
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,681
Hup-ah!

233
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,225
I mean,
my little girl buddy.

234
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,561
That's very nice, Dad,
but it's wrong for you

235
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,855
to reward violent,
competitive behavior.

236
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,565
However, I will
sit up front with you

237
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,442
if it's a fatherly
gesture of love.

238
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,818
Okay, honey.

239
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,528
Sucker!

240
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,655
Competitive violence--
that's why you're here!

241
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,370
Ow!

242
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,413
(yelling)

243
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:24,957
(yells)

244
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,709
(grunts, yells)

245
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,003
(grunts)

246
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,464
(growls)

247
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:35,801
(snarling)

248
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,512
APU: We are having
our best season ever.

249
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:42,600
I would like to say that
it is because of teamwork.

250
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,185
Gee,
who am I kidding, huh?

251
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,603
It's all because of Lisa.

252
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,021
Let's hear it for Lisa.

253
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,022
(all cheering)

254
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,359
Hey, Bart,

255
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,569
if Lisa's better
than you at hockey,

256
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,405
does that mean you're gonna
become better than her at school?

257
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,948
(gasps)

258
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,035
Maybe I will, Milhouse.

259
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,663
Maybe I will.

260
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,085
Who can tell me
the capital of Spain?

261
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,294
Bart Simpson.

262
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,004
The square root of 36?

263
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,756
Bart Simpson.

264
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,132
Who freed the slaves?

265
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,509
Bart Simpson.

266
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,593
Bart Simpson?

267
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,053
Bart Simpson.

268
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,347
Bart Simpson,
will you stop raising your hand?

269
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,848
You haven't had
one right answer all day.

270
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,974
Sorry.

271
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,851
(grunting)

272
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,020
This is for wasting
teacher's valuable time.

273
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,650
Lay off, guys!

274
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,151
He's with me.

275
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,237
It's a lucky coincidence

276
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,364
you happen to be
your sister's brother.

277
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,532
Don't worry, Bart.

278
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,575
They won't
bother you anymore.

279
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,536
(laughing)

280
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,124
I hardly ever let Mother
fight for me anymore.

281
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,667
Sorry, Bart.

282
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,878
I'm gonna hang out
with Lisa for protection...

283
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,922
and to be seen.

284
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,427
Come watch TV 
with me, Dad.

285
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,053
We missed the first
two episodes of "Cops."

286
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,305
But if we hurry,
we can catch the last three.

287
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,767
Sorry, Bart. Lisa and I
are going out for gelato.

288
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,437
We'd ask you to come, but...

289
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,604
you know...

290
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,189
Oh...

291
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,650
Bart, I can spend
some time with you.

292
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,277
I don't know, Mom.

293
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,361
Don't have a
stereotypical view of me

294
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,821
just because
I'm your mother.

295
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,742
I know, how about
we play the basketball?

296
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,827
I'm no Harvey 
Globetrotter, but--

297
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,620
(groans)

298
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,957
Watch out for
the Shaq attack!

299
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,376
Ooh! Ow!

300
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,086
I told you
to watch out.

301
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,089
Hey, Milhouse, knock him
down if he's in your way!

302
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,799
Jimbo, Jimbo,
go for the face!

303
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,761
Look. Ralph Wiggum 
lost his shin guard!

304
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,220
Hack the bone!

305
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,930
Hack the bone!

306
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,642
Wow! Eye of the tiger.
Mouth of a Teamster.

307
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:53,314
Just think of all the time
I wasted on you!

308
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,608
Yeah, well, not wasted.

309
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,610
Uh... I love you.

310
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:03,824
MARGE: Let me give my special
little winner a big, big hug.

311
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,620
LISA: Ma, I think
I'm all hugged out.

312
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,622
Oh, one more.

313
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,791
(Marge grunting)

314
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,335
(sighs)

315
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,795
Hello, Queen Lisa.

316
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,755
Bart, what are you
doing in my room?

317
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:21,258
Lisa, certain differences--
rivalries if you will--

318
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,718
have come up between us.

319
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,428
At first, I thought
we could talk it over

320
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,096
like civilized people,

321
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,435
but instead, I just ripped
the head off Mr. Honeybunny.

322
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,021
Bart, that was your
cherished childhood toy.

323
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,398
Ah, Mr. Honeybunny!

324
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,650
(gasping)

325
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,985
(kissing loudly)

326
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,986
HOMER:
Quiet down, Bart!

327
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,446
Bart, just
get out of here.

328
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,365
Hey, it's a free country.
You get out.

329
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,533
That doesn't make sense.

330
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,326
I know you are,
but what am I?

331
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,786
Get out! Get out!

332
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,663
Okay!

333
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:54,124
But on my way,
I'm going to be doing this.

334
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:58,796
If you get hit,
it's your own fault.

335
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,008
Okay. Then I'm gonn start
kicking air like this.

336
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,845
And if any part of you
should fill that air,

337
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,639
it's your own fault.

338
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,517
(both grunting)

339
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,479
(Bart and Lisa yelling)

340
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,234
Hmm, I'd better go
check that out.

341
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:24,405
Now, Homer,
don't you eat this pie.

342
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,615
Okay.

343
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,076
All right, pie,
I'm just gonna do this.

344
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,203
(munching sounds)

345
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,289
And if you get eaten,
it's your own fault.

346
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,583
(munching sounds)

347
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,584
D'oh!

348
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,585
Oh!

349
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,004
Oh... my!

350
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:40,963
The hell with it.

351
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,259
(gagging)

352
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,677
Stop it!
Stop it!

353
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,678
Stop it!
Stop it!

354
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,055
Stop it!

355
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,765
Mom, that is
really annoying.

356
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,851
-Bart started it.
-Nuh-uh, Lisa started it.

357
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,519
I don't care who started it.

358
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,729
I don't ever want

Repeat: You are not

363
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,740
Hey, Apu just called.

364
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,743
This Friday, Lisa's team
is playing Bart's team.

365
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,786
You're in direct
competition!

366
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,330
And don't go easy
on each other

367
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,748
just because you're
brother and sister.

368

if you promise
to return to your cells.

376
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,897
Sorry, pig.
We can't make that promise.

377
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,858
All right. All right,
I'll sweeten the deal.

378
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,693
You can see the game,
you don't have to come back,

379
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:49,365
but you have to promise not
to commit any more crimes, okay?

380
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,533
-No.
-I'll take that as a yes.

381

at a real bad time, Moe.

401

I'm too tense

I mean, really
how are they doing?

405

Any disabling injuries?
Something, say,

406
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,054
that the gambling community
might not yet know about?

407
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,806
Come here,

00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,182
Moe, I think
you should leave.

But, Blanche, you gotta
help me out here.
