37
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,415
Besides, you kids

morals and decency

39

have ever sounded so plausible.

79

It's not your fault
Jessica doesn't like you.

80
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,403
Is it my hair, my overbite?

81
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,738
The fact I've worn
the same clothes

82
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,657
day in, day out
for the last four years?

83
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,409
No, Bart. I just think
you and Jessica are too different

84
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,370
from each other to get along.

85
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,247
She's a sweet, kind
reverend's daughter,

86
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,083

Yes, ma'am.
I'd like to return

93
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,141
to your wonderful
Sunday school, please.

94
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,769
But, Bart, we banned you
from Sunday school.

95
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:33,898
You were happy, we were happy,
everybody was happy.

96

97
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,321
I've changed my ways.

98

Please give me
another chance, ma'am.

99
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,617
All right, Bart.

100
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,370
The Bible does teach
forgiveness.

101
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:51,165
Class, I want you to welcome back
our prodigal son.

102
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,875
What's
prodigal mean?

103
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,252
Oh, dear.

104
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,921
You know, the great thing
about Sunday school

105
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,091
is we're finally learning
something we can use.

106
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,093
Yeah, so true.

107
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,721
I have to turn my chair
this way now.

108
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,726
Somehow I got to convince her
I'm a good person.

109
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,771
All right. I have to sit here
and behave no matter what.

110
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,815
Okay, class, we have
a special treat today

111
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,525
for pass-around:

112
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:21,362
A replica of the slingshot
David used to slay Goliath.

113
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,239
While you kids are
looking at that,

114
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,158
I'll busy myself
in this file cabinet.

115
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:34,167
Must... fight... Satan.

116
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,712

117
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:40,882
...later.

119
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:45,261

staying after school

120
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,430

teacher clean up.

you don't say?

123

(shouting and cheering)

124
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,315
There is just no pleasing
a girl like that.

125
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,360
All that unnecessary behaving.

126
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,321
I'm all tense through
the chestal area.

127
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,989
I need relief.

129
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,999
Though the kilt was only
for day-to-day wear,

130
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,542
in battle,

131
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,546
we donned a full-length
ball gown covered in sequins.

132
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,383
The idea was to blind
your opponent with luxury.

on some kind of explosives.

Congratulations, Simpson.

141
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,407
You just fell for our sting,

142
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,076
and won yourself
three months' detention.

143
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,413

144
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,414
There's not?

145
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,582
You used me, Skinner!

146
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,459
You used me!

149
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,384
I saw the way
they set you up.

150
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,803
That was really unfair.

151

Uh... sure.

Great.

156
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,440
We eat at 7:00.

157
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,234
There's only one thing to do
at a moment like this...

rocket sled champ.

was an Olympic event.

00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,681
Well, no offense, lady, but what
you don't know could fill a warehouse.

183
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,599
(gasping)

184
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,434
Young man,
explain yourself.

185
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,811
Sorry. I have kind
of a short fuse,

186
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,647
which some
find charming.

187
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,398
Speaking of charming,

188
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:48,361
watching Fox last night,
I heard a rather amusing story.

189
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,781
This character named Martin
was feeling rather randy,

190
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,491
and he was heard to remark...

191
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,117
(grunts)

192
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,370
And don't you ever come near
my daughter again.

193
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,665
Never have I heard such
gratuitous use of the word "butt".

194
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,708
-But, but, but...
-Make him stop.

195
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,585
-But, but, but...
-Make him stop!

196
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,762
You're bad,
Bart Simpson.

197
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,222
No, I'm not.
I'm really--

198
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,682
Yes, you are.
You're bad.

199
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,058
And I like it.

200
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,893
I'm bad to the bone, honey.

201
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,061
Let's go find some fun.

202
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,229
But your father said--

203
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,148
I told the rev
I was going to my room

204
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,567
to say my prayers.

205
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,904
Smart, beautiful and a liar.

206
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,074
So much better than
that Sarah, plain and tall.

207
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:42,582
♪♪

208
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,718
Woo!

209
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:54,885
Right there.
Put it right there.

210
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,429
(both laughing)

211
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,432
Oh, excellent.
You're incredible, Jessica.

212
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,685
Your throws, your catches,
your spirals, your loops.

213
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,355
It's like the toilet paper
is an extension of your body.

214
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,940
Wee!

215
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,317
No way would
a minister's daughter

216
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,319
go out with you.

217
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,446
Oh, yeah? I'll prove it.

218
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,364
Hey, Jessica.

219
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,867
Yes, am I supposed
to know you?

220
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,744
Jessica, we just-- Oof!

221
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:23,080
That's for besmirching
an innocent girl's name.

222
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,125
Why?

223
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,210
I'm sorry, Bart.

224
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,547
You know my parents
can't find out about us.

225
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:36,135
And besides, if it's secret,
it's even more exciting.

226
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,762
I guess.

227
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,513
Hey, you want to
go skateboarding?

228
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,015
Um, actually,

229
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,434
I was hoping I could
sit down for just a second.

230
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,228
Come on. It'll be fun.

231
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,732
Wow!

232
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,193
Now I have the energy
to do anything.

233
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,736
Oh!

234
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,862
Just give me two minutes.

235
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:55,696
Oh!

236
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,786
BART: Jessica, I think
this is too steep.

237
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,623
Bart, you can't trust your
perception at this altitude.

238
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,124
(grunts)

239
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,751
(screaming)

240
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,378
(laughing)

241
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,965
Actually, if the road surface
maintains its integrity,

242
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,176
I just might be able to hold on.

243
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,554
(Bart shouting)

244
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,434
(sighs)

245
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,812
(screams)

246
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,357
(sighs)

247
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,403
Oh, the glue will slow me down.

248
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,612
Any glue leaking?

249
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,572
No, that glue
ain't going nowhere.

250
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,075
Oh, nothing's ever
gonna stop me.

251
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,623
(grunting)

252
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,170
MAN: Oh, no.
There goes the glue after all.

253
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,132
No!

254
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,804
(gasps)
Fun, huh?

255
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,056
(gurgling)

256
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,813
(meowing)

257
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,107
Have you noticed
any change in Bart?

258
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,608
New glasses?

259
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,778
No. He looks like something
might be disturbing him.

260
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,864
Probably misses
his old glasses.

261
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,408
I guess we could get more
involved in Bart's activities,

262
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,286
but then I'd be afraid
of smothering him.

263
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,455
Yeah, and then
we'd get the chair.

264
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,664
That's not what I meant.

265
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,374
It was, Marge. Admit it.

266
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,292
(bell ringing)

267
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,589
-Hi.
-Uh, we should get to class.

268
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,175
-What's the hurry?
-We could get in trouble for being late.

269
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,510
Oh, you worry too much.

270
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,596
Come on.
If you stay here a while,

271
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,931
I'll let you hold my hand.

272
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,312
(Bart gasps)

273
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,480
-(alarm ringing)
-(Jessica laughs)

274
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,148
Teamwork.
Come on, Bart.

275
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,192
(siren wailing)

276
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,281
If I don't save the
wee turtles, who will?

277
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,329
Aah!
Save me from the wee turtles.

278
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,831
They were too quick for me.
Aah!

279
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,541
I can't believe it, Bart.

280
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,127
I'd always thought
Jessica was so sweet.

281
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,545
She's like a milk dud, Lis.

282
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,049
Sweet on the outside,
poison on the inside.

283
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,342
You gotta give her up.

284
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,135
No, no, wait. Hear my plan.

285
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,471
Put up with her
for seven more years.

286
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,056
Then we'll get married.

287
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,641
Once the first
baby comes along,

288
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,851
she's bound to settle down
and start treating me right.

289
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,394
After all, I deserve it.

290
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,940
Bart, it's naive to think
you can change a person...

291
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:39,485
Except maybe that boy
who works in the library.

292
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,446
Do you have
"Go, Dog, Go"?

293
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,406
(scoffs)
That's in juvenile.

294
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,991
This is young adult.

295
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,953
Well-read, and just
a little wild.

296
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:52,581
Ooh, if only someone
could tame him.

297
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,041
You're right, Lisa.

298
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,085
Love isn't about
fixing someone.

299
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,754
I'm just gonna
give her up cold turkey.

300
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,049
I'm not going to talk to her
or see her. It's over.

301
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,343
Thanks for the advice, sis.

302
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,302
(sighing)

303
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,022
There.
If I can just get through

304
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,607
this many days
without seeing her,

305
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,901
she should be completely
out of my system.

306
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,237
Okay, day one.

307
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,660
Time for church, Bart.

308
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,412
I bet your little friend
Jessica will be there.

309
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,246
D'oh!

310
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,545
-(soprano singing)
-Jessica.

311
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,796
Bart, be strong.

312
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,464
You don't need
that little hellcat.

313
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,927
Oh, Lis, she's already
drawing me to her

314
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,680
with her beautiful siren song.

315
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,104
(singing in falsetto)

316
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:01,400
Oh, that's very disturbing. Hnh!

317
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,902
Hey, Bart.

318
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,445
What?
What's wrong?

319
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,155
Well, Jessica,

320
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:10,242
I don't think we should
hang out together anymore.

321
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,994
You're turning me
into a criminal,

322
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,413
when all I want to be
is a petty thug.

323
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,083
Oh, good. Here comes
the collection plate.

324
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,802
Homer!

325
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,429
We can spare it, Marge.

326
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,805
We've been blessed.

327
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,600
You're right
about everything, Bart.

328
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,894
I have been too reckless.

329
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:41,148
From now on,
I am going to settle down.

330
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,737
(gasps)
Jessica, what are you doing?

331
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,531
Well, it takes money
to start a new life.

332
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,201
Stealing from the collection
basket is really wrong.

333
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,494
Even I know that.

334
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,955
Ah, fine.
You just lost your cut.

335
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,582
I'll just take that.

336
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,751
(gasps)

337
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,545
Everyone turn around
and look at this.

338
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,505
(gasping)

339
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,590
What is it, a unitarian?

340
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,843
(clamoring)

341
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,055
<i>Just relax. For once,</i>
<i>you didn't do anything wrong.</i>

342
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,307
<i>Just explain yourself,</i>
<i>and everyone will understand.</i>

343
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,350
I...

344
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,476
Took the money?
Yes, we know.

345
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,477
He confessed.

346
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,187
Okay.

347
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,692
HOMER: Stop him,
he's headed for the window!

348
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,572
Son, if you can look me
in the eye

349
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,242
and say you didn't take
the collection money,

350
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,160
that's all I need.

351
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,578
I didn't take it.

352
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,621
Why, you little...

353
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,622
How can you
look me in the eye

354
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,707
and lie like that?

355
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,749
MARGE:
Homer, stop that.

356
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,209
I believe him.

357
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,294
Tell me, if he didn't
take the money,

358
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,922
why is he wearing
those fancy clothes?

359
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,841
That's what he
wore to church.

360
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,509
Ooh, how convenient.

361
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:53,345
Bart, honey, do you know
who did take the money?

362
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,182
No.

363
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,893
See, son? Telling
the truth isn't so bad.

364
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,067
(booing)

365
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,360
-Crook!
-Thief!

366
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,737
Stealer of money from
the church collection plate!

367
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,492
We've got to talk.

368
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,077
Listen, thanks for
not turning me in.

369
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,413
That was sweet.

370
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,415
Well, it seems like if you
really care for me,

371
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,125
you should come forward.

372
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,085
Oh, don't you see, it's
because I care for you

373
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,795
that I can't come forward.

374
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,423
That doesn't make any sense.

375
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,550
Alright, then I just don't
feel like it, okay?

376
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,260
Jessica,
you're really beautiful,

377
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,179
but you are
not very nice.

378
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,638
(scoffs) Duh.

379
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,890
You know, with the way
you're treating me,

380
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,266
why should I protect you?

381
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,603
Because if you tell,
no one will believe you.

382
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:46,440
Remember, I'm the sweet,
perfect minister's daughter,

383
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,108
and you're just
yellow trash.

384
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:48,984
Huh?

385
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,574
So here's where you're hiding.

386
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,201
Yeah, this is my
only refuge

387
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,744
from the taunts
and accusations

388
00:17:58,827 --> 00:17:59,745
of the townspeople.

389
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,081
Thief.

390
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,708
Bart, we can't just let her
get away with this!

391
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,751
Give it up, Lis.

392
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,795
She's a criminal mastermind.

393
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,254
She's got 108 I.Q.

394
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,256
She reads at
a fifth grade level,

395
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,800
and... (sighs)

396
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:16,053
her hair smells
like red Froot Loops.

397
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:20,516
Yeah? Well, I eat
Froot Loops for breakfast.

398
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,851
Because of
last week's problems,

399
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,269
we'll be taking
certain precautions

400
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,063
with this week's collection.

401
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,981
We really shouldn't have
let them do this.

402
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,817
It can't be helping
his self-esteem.

403
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,153
Now for our offertory reading,
Lisa Simpson,

404
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,614
who we'll all be
keeping an eye on.

405
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,077
I know most of you have already
judged my brother guilty

406
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,662
without any proof,

407
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,081
but doesn't
the Bible teach us

408
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,251
"Judge not, lest ye
be judged", Reverend?

409
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,837
I think it may be
somewhere towards the back.

410
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,714
There is someone among us
with a guilty conscience.

411
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,466
After much soul searching

412
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,094
I decided it would be wrong
of me to name names,

413
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:01,932
but I urge that guilty person,
here, under the eyes of God,

414
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,269
to come forward,
to confess and save yourself

415
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,021
from the torment
of your own personal hell!

416
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,525
Aah! I smelled some
marijuana smoke in Vietnam!

417
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,069
I was the one that
canceled "Star Trek"!

418
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,406
I left my Porsche keys
inside Mrs. Glick.

419
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,325
I am talking
to the collection money thief.

420
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,955
Only you can come forward
and end this injustice.

421
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,418
Oh, what the heck.

422
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,461
It was Jessica Lovejoy!

423
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,629
(all gasping)

424
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,131
If you search her room,

425
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,717
I am certain you
will find the money.

426
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,052
To the little girl's room.

427
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,098
That's the
collection money.

428
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,392
Oh, yeah.
Smells like church.

429
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,561
I guess it's obvious
what's happened here.

430
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,855
Bart Simpson
has somehow managed

431
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,815
to sneak his bedroom
into my house.

432
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,904
Well, come on,
use your imaginations.

433
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,697
No, Dad.

434
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,616
I did it.

435
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:04,912
It's your classic cry
for attention.

436
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,496
Well, young lady,
I suppose

437
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,790
we brought you home
from boarding school

438
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,292
a little prematurely.

439
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,920
I was expelled, Dad.

440
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,047
Remember the pipe bomb,
the glee club brawl?

441
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,424
Remember the school chapel
collection plate?

442
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,676

445

my son an apology.

446
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,728
-Very sorry.
-That's okay.

447
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,188
Appreciate it.

448
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,439
Mm-hmm.

449
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,694
BART:
Hi, Jessica.

450
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,779
Hi, Bart.

451
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,530
Come to watch me suffer?

452
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,990
I just wanted
to let you know

453
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,785
that even though this was
a difficult experience,

454
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,787
I really learned a lot.

455
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,707
I'm a little wiser
and a little less naive.

456
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,751
Well, I learned that

457
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,379
I can make men do
whatever I want.

458
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,589
Well, don't you see,
Jessica?

459
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,217
Then you really
haven't learned--

460
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,344
Um, would you finish
scrubbing these steps for me?

461
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,512
Will I?

462
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,683
Hey, Jessica.

463
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,558
Coming.

464
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,897
Poor sucker.

465
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:17,401
It's amazing what some guys
will do for a pretty face.

466
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,860
Not me, though.

467
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,154
Wait till she sees
the second-rate job

00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,823
I do on these stairs.
