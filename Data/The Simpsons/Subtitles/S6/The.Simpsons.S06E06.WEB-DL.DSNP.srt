Hello once again.

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,298
As usual, I must warn you all
that this year's Halloween show

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,384
is very, very scary,

4
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:11,011
and those of you
with young children

5
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,513
may want to send them
off to bed--

6
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:17,100
Oh, my. It seems
the show is so scary

7
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,352
that congress
won't even let us show it.

8
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,895
Instead, they've suggested

9
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,231
the 1947 classic
Glenn Ford movie

10
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,275
"200 Miles to Oregon."

Homer, did you
remember to lock

34
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,670
the front door
of the house?

35
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:09,671
D'oh!

36
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,633
Well, it's been two long trips

37
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,552
but we're finally
almost there again.

38
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,053
When you locked
the front door,

39
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,304
did you remember to lock
the back door?

40
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,305
D'oh! D'oh!

41
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,477
(gasps) Oh, no!

42
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,980
We left Grampa
back at the gas station.

43
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,441
What about Grampa?

44
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,740
-Hi. We're here.
-We made it.

45
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,577
Oh, goody. The sea monkeys
I ordered have arrived.

46
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,620
Look at them
cavort and caper.

47
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,582
Sir, they're the new
winter caretakers for the lodge.

48
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,961
Yes, they work hard
and they play hard.

49
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:52,964
This house has quite a long
and colorful history.

50
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:56,634
It was built on an ancient
Indian burial ground

51
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:00,430
and was the setting of
satanic rituals, witch-burnings

52
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,016
and five John Denver
Christmas specials.

53
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,518
Oh... John Denver.

54
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,942
Hmm... that's odd.

55
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,152
Usually the blood

56
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,528
gets off at
the second floor.

57
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,284
(chain saw buzzing)

58
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,662
Hey, I found a shortcut
through your hedge maze.

59
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,372
Why, you little--

60
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,124
<i>No, go easy on</i>
<i>the wee one.</i>

61
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,335
<i>His father's gonna go crazy</i>

62
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,836
<i>and chop them all</i>
<i>into haggis.</i>

63
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,837
What's haggis?

64
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,423
Boy, you read my thoughts.

65
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,008
You've got the shinning.

66
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,301
You mean "shining."

67
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,053
Shh! You want to get sued?

68
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,139
Now look, boy,
if your Dad goes gaga,

69
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:48,102
you just use that shin
of yours to call me

70
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,021
and I'll come a-running.

71
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,941
But don't be reading my mind
between 4:00 and 5:00.

72
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:53,900
That's Willie's time.

73
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,782
Yes, by cutting off cable TV
and the beer supply,

74
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:04,661
I can ensure an honest winter's
work out of those lowlifes.

75
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,498
Sir, did you ever stop to think
that maybe it was doing this

76
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,791
that caused the previous
caretakers to go insane

77
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:10,792
and murder their families?

78
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,961
Hmm. Perhaps.
Tell you what:

79
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,462
we come back and everyone's
slaughtered,

80
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,256
I owe you a Coke.

81
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,098
Hmm... cable's out.

82
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,267
Think I'll have a beer.

83
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,602
Hmm...
not a drop in the house.

84
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,687
What do you know?

85
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,021
Homer, I'm impressed.

86
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,606
You're taking this quite well.

87
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,608
I'll kill you!
I'll kill all of you!

88
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,277
-Homer!
-Sorry, sorry.

89
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,945
Don't worry.

90
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,698
There's plenty I can do
to keep myself occupied.

91
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,033
Maybe I'll check out
that ax collection.

92
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,035
See you later.

93
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,037
Mom, is Dad going to kill us?

94
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,998
We're just gonna have
to wait and see.

95
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,712
So, what will it be, Homer?

96
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,046
Moe! Give me a beer.

97
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,048
No, not unless you
kill your family.

98
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,800
Why should I
kill my family?

99
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,677
Uh... they'd be much
happier as ghosts.

100
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,053
You don't look so happy.

101
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,763
Oh I'm happy!
I'm very happy.

102
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,348
La-la-la-la-la. See?

103
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,434
Now waste your family.
I'll give you a beer.

104
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,144
Homer?

105
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,895
Homey?

106
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,691
Hmm... what he's typed will be
a window into his madness.

107
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,364
"Feelin' fine."

108
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,824
Wow, that's a relief.

109
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,702
Oooooh...

110
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,630
Hmm... this is
less encouraging.

111
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,798
Hello!

112
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,425
(screaming)

113
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,927
So, what do you think, Marge?

114
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,555
All I need is a title.

115
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,640
I was thinking along the lines

116
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:54,187
of "no TV and no beer make
Homer something something."

117
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,813
Go crazy?

118
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,565
Don't mind if I do.

119
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,526
(raving)

120
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,991
(Marge screaming)

121
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,118
Stay away from me, Homer.

122
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,370
Give me the bat, Marge.

123
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,413
Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.

124
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,166
Come on, give me the bat.
Give me the bat-bat-boo!

125
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,376

126
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,378

Scaredy-cat.

127

128
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,421

129
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,176
(grunting)

130
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,096
You stay here
till you're no longer insane.

131
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,640
Hmm, chili
would be good tonight.

132
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,643
(knocking)

133
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,311
Homer, it's Moe.

134
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,606
Look, some of the ghouls and I
are a little concerned

135
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,733
the project isn't
moving forward.

136
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,151
Can't murder now-- eating.

137
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,404
Aw, for crying out loud,
come on.

138
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,863
No!

139
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,329
Here's Johnny!

140
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,330

00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,334

142
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,086

I'm Mike Wallace,
I'm Morley Safer

145

146
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,468
All this and Andy Rooney

Oh. Well,

151
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,523
I was worried
there for a second.

152
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,649
No answer.

153
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,067
Don't worry, Mom.

154
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,446
I can use my... shinning
to call Willie.

155
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,243
<i>And that was the first time</i>
<i>she'd ever flown a plane.</i>

156
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,163
Uh-oh. The little fat boy
and his family are in trouble.

157
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,166
I'm coming to rescue
the lot of you.

158
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:42,170
All right, loony,
show me what you got.

159
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,465
Is that the best
you can do?

160
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:49,177
Oh, my, I hope that rug
was Scotchgarded.

161
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,181
Must kill family.

Dad, look!

167
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,451

170
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,792
fading... fading.

171
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,128
Rising. Fading.

172
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,379
Fading.

173
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,256
Gone.

<i>it's the Tony Awards</i>

180
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,860
<i>with your hosts</i>
<i>Tyne Daly and Hal Linden.</i>

181
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,903
Homer, change channel.

182
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,863
Can't... frozen.

185
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,037
Urge to kill rising.

186
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,503
You know, Marge,
I've had my share of troubles,

187
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:09,465
but sitting here now with you
and the kids in our cozy home

188
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,425
in this beautiful,
free country,

189
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,346
it just makes me feel
that I'm really a lucky guy.

190
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,516
Dad! Your hand is jammed
in the toaster!

191
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,101
(all yelling)

192
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,853
(Homer screaming)

193
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,314
Get it off!
Get it off!

194
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,149
Get this off of me!

195
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,776
Ooh!

196
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,028
Whew-hoo!

197
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,488
Dad! It's in there again!

198
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,865
(screaming)

199
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,660
(yelling)

200
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,872
This shouldn't be
too hard to fix

201
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,791
with the right tools.

202
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,339
There.

203
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,009
Better than new.

204
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,553
Now to take her
for a test toast.

205
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,639
What the--

206
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,813
(screaming)

207
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,816
Look at that. I'm the first
non-Brazilian person

208
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,735
to travel backwards
through time.

209
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,195
Correction, Homer.
You're the second.

210
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,864
That's right,
Mr. Peabody.

211
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,032
Quiet, you.

212
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,745
(gasps)

213
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,748
I've gone back to the time

214
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:27,043
when dinosaurs weren't
just confined to zoos.

215
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,461
(screeching)

216
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,254
Okay, don't panic.

217
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,966
Remember the advice your father
gave you on your wedding day.

218
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,762
If you ever travel back in time,
don't step on anything

219
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,097
because even the tiniest change

220
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:44,185
can alter the future
in ways you can't imagine.

221
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,063
Fine. As long as I
stand perfectly still

222
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:51,025
and don't touch anything,
I won't destroy the future.

223
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,444
Stupid bug!
You go squish now.

224
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,366
But that was just one little
insignificant mosquito.

225
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,284
That can't change
the future, right?

226
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,869
Right?

227
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,121
(grunts "I don't know")

228
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,961
Phew! I'm back.

229
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,759
Aw, my loving family.

230
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,552
Nothing's changed.

231
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,475
<i>Hidely-ho, slaverinos.</i>

232
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,435
ALL: Okely-dokely.

233
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,730
Hey, what the hell is that
geek Flanders doing on TV?

234
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,440
(alarm sounding)

235
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,983
<i>Oh, I see by the big board</i>

236
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,653
<i>we got a negative Nellie</i>
<i>in sector two.</i>

237
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,905
<i>I'm afraid I'm gonna have to</i>
<i>ask the whole family</i>

238
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,783
<i>to kinda freeze and</i>
<i>prepare for re-neducation.</i>

239
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,410
Don't you remember, Dad?

240
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,787
Flanders is the unquestioned
lord and master of the world.

241
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,788
D'oh!

242
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,053
<i>Okay, everybody,</i>
<i>let's see some big smiles.</i>

243
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:07,059
<i>Just relax and let</i>
<i>the hooks do their work.</i>

244
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,687
What the hell
are you smiling at?

245
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,564
Oh...

246
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,733
<i>Now, in case all that smiling</i>
<i>didn't cheer you up</i>

247
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,818
<i>there's one thing</i>
<i>that never fails--</i>

248
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,278
A nice glass of warm milk,

249
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,613
a little nap and
a total frontal lobotomy.

250
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,782
It's not so bad, Homer.

251
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,034
They go in through your nose

252
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,620
and they let you keep

253
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,205
the piece of brain
they cut out.

254
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,667
Look. Whoo, hello.
Hello there.

255
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,669
Who's that big man there?

256
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,670
Who's that?

257
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,631
BOTH:
Join us, Father.

258
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:42,136
It's bliss.

259
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,512
No!

260
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,805
(alarm sounding)

261
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,808
(frantic panting)

262
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,435
(dogs barking)

263
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,771
Oh, no, they're gaining on me.

264
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,272
Wait! I have an idea.

265
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,899
These wieners will give me

266
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,275
the quick energy
I need to escape.

267
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,822
I got to go back.

268
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,240
Fix future.

269
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,580
This time I'm not gonna
touch a thing.

270
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,623
(roaring)

271
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,999
Ah!

272
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,835
Ooh! Ooh! Mustn't crush,
mustn't kill.

273
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,837
Made it.

274
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:21,300
Oh, I wish, I wish
I hadn't killed that fish.

275
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,768
Hey, where is everybody?

276
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,606
Hey, there's a bug
that looks like Dad.

277
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,607
Let's kill it.

278
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,900
Okay.

279
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,485
(screaming)

280
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,113
(panting)

281
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,407
Oh... oh...

282
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,077
-(roaring)
-Ah-choo!

283
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,247
(sneezes)

284
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,416
(sneezing)

285
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,463
This is gonna cost me.

286
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:05,886
HOMER: D'oh!

287
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,429
I mean, hey...

288
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,182
Good morning, Father dear.
Hope you're well.

289
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,517
Are we taking the new Lexus

290
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,519
to Aunt Patty and Selma's
funeral today?

291
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,688
Hmm, fabulous house,
well-behaved kids

292
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,940
Sisters-in-law dead,
luxury sedan...

293
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,442
Whoo-hoo! I hit the jackpot!

294
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,405
Marge dear, would you
kindly pass me a doughnut?

295
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,490
Doughnut? What's a doughnut?

296
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,409
(screaming)

297
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,994
(screaming)

298
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,539
Hmm, it's raining again.

299
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,378
You're still not
in your own world, Homer.

300
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,299
I can get you home,
but you have to do exactly as--

301
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,009
Ah!

302
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,010
(deep male voice)
This is indeed

303
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,554
a disturbing universe.

304
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,556
Don't touch anything?!

305
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,017
I'll touch whatever I feel like!

306
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,769
(roaring)

307
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,238
Foolish Earthling.

308
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,740
Totally unprepared
for the effects

309
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:08,991
of time travel.

310
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,618
(laughing)

311
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,589
What happened to us,
Kodos?

312
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,757
Quiet, you.

313
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,055
(panting)

314
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,725
Good morning, dear.

315
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,060
What's my name?
What color is the sky?

316
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,395
What of doughnuts? What?!

317
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,023
For the love
of God, tell me!

318
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,524
Homer, the sky is blue.

319
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,151
Doughnuts are plentiful.

320
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,028
Friday is
T.G.I.F. night on ABC.

321
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,655
What's gotten into you?

322
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,781
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

323
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,782
Let's just eat.

324
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,538
(slurping)

325
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,749
Ah, close enough.

326
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,132
(clamoring)

327
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,802
(whistles)
Hey, everybody.

328
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,637
Let's all turn
our desks backwards

329
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,639
before Mrs. Krabappel shows up.

330
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,807
-Yeah!
-Great idea.

331
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,185
(laughing)

332
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,228
Huh?

333
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,646
All right, backwards boy

334
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,564
back your butt
down to detention.

335
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,318
Over here, Simpson.

336
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,278
The detention room
is dangerously overcrowded,

337
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,072
so you'll be serving your time
in the cafeteria.

338
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,281
Oxygen running out.

339
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,700
Yes, you should have
thought of that

340
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,702
before you made
that paper airplane.

341
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,621
This overcrowding
in detention

342
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,039
is becoming critical.

343
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,457
It's a powder keg
waiting to go off

344
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,376
in an explosion of
unacceptable behavior.

345
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,294
Don't bitch to me,
boss man.

346
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,504
Thanks to the latest
budget cuts,

347
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,007
I'm down to using
grade "F" meat.

348
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,968
Wouldn't it be wonderful

349
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,386
if there was a common solution
to both our problems?

350
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,846
That would be great.

351
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,514
Hey, Bart, watch this.

352
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,101
-Oh, drats!
-Oh, no!

353
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,978
My favorite outfit.

354
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,690
Jimbo, this is by far
the worst... mmm.

355
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,526
Mmm...

356
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,947
Jimbo, why don't you assist
lunch lady Doris in the kitchen?

357
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,783
-Bite me, Skinner.
-Well, might we.

358
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,994
JIMBO: It's hard for me
to clean this giant pot

359
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,121
when you keep spilling
meat tenderizer all over me.

360
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,914
(clank)

361
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,625
Oh great. Now I got to work
in the dark.

362
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,965
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

363
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,885
This sandwich tastes
so young and impudent.

364
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,928
Seymour, what's
with the good grub?

365
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,639
Well, perhaps I ought to
let you folks in on a secret.

366
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,683
You remember me
telling Jimbo Jones

367
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,144
that I'd make something of him
one day?

368
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,272
(gasps) Are you saying
you killed Jimbo,

369
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,524
processed his carcass
and served him for lunch?

370
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:49,943
Ha!

371
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,201
Hmm... I wonder
where Jimbo is today.

372
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,285
He should have
beaten us up

373
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,079
for our lunch money
an hour ago.

374
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,413
Frau lunch lady.

375
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,332
Please to have
another sloppy Jimbo.

376
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,625
<i>Das ist gut, nein?</i>

377
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,628
That's your third helping,
young man.

378
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,171
It's making you fat
and soft...

379
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,715
and tender.

380
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,468
Mmm... you just cut
in line, didn't you?

381
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,471
-Report to detention, Uter.
-For how long?

382
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,973
Oh, about seven minutes
a pound should do it.

383
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,773
Okay, I got your
German grub right here.

384
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,193
Bart, does it strike you as odd
that Uter disappeared

385
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,279
and suddenly they're serving us
this mysterious food

386
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,656
called "Uterbraten"?

387
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,491
Oh, relax, kids.

388
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,452
I've got a gut feeling
Uter's around here somewhere.

389
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,246
(chuckling)

390
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,998
After all, isn't there
a little Uter in all of us?

391
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:48,377
(laughing)

392
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,381
In fact, you might even say
we just ate Uter

393
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,299
and he's in our stomachs
right now.

394
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,385
(laughing)

395
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,303
Wait. Scratch that one.

396
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,181
Mom! You've got to help.

397
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,268
They're cooking kids
in the school cafeteria.

398
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,353
Listen kids. You're eight
and ten years old now.

399
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,730
I can't be fighting all
your battles for you.

400
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,108
-But, Mom--
-No "buts."

401
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,277
You march right back
to that school

402
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,071
look them in the eye
and say, "don't eat me."

403
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,239
BOTH: Okay.

404
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,123
Since so many students have been
put on permanent detention--

405
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,666
(burps)

406
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,669
We've merged everyone
into a single class.

407
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,671
I trust there are no objections.

408
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,258
(shuddering)

409
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,971
Detention.

410
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,647
(Milhouse gasps)

411
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,318
Psst! Hey, you guys.

412
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:58,447
I was just thinking
that any of us could be next.

413
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,741
So what do you say
we make a break for it?

414
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,664

416
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,420
Easy there, young man.

417
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,881
You'll only make yourself
tired and stringy.

418
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,759
Now to check on
the free-range children.

419
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,843

420
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,848
Hold on, kids!

421
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,976
I'm coming to rescue
the lot of you.

I'll-- Ow!

423
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,271
Ah... I'm bad at this.

424
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:39,279
I'm going to enjoy
devouring you, Bart Simpson.

425
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:44,326
Yes, I believe I'll start,
as you've so often suggested

426
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,912
by eating your shorts.

427
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,205

Nevertheless,
I remain confident

that something
will come along

436
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,311
and save the two
Simpson children.

Relax, honey.

You were just having
a crazy nightmare.
