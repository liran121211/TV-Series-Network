00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,747
Lisa, will you
keep it down?

8
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,749
I'm making a crank phone call
to Principal Skinner.

9
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,501
<i>Well, as a matter of fact,</i>
<i>my refrigerator wasn't running.</i>

10

<i>-Thank you, anonymous young man.</i>
-D'oh!

12
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,632
It's my room
and I can do what I want.

13
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,967
Oh, yeah?

14
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,344
Well, I can do what
I want in my room.

Bart, quit it!

18
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,145
I can keep this up all day.

19
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,401
(sighs)

20
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,613
(saxophone playing)

21
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,323
Lisa, stop the racket.

22
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,824
I'm trying to fix
your mother's camera.

23
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:18,995
Now, easy, easy...

24
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,330
Hmm...

25
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,332
I'm gonna need
a bigger drill.

26
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,004
(sighs)

27
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:35,220
My, these seas are
certainly heaving.

28
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:39,182
Well, no more than your
bountiful bosom, milady.

29
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,059
(giggling)

30
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,394
Does that earring
mean you're a pirate?

31
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,896
Kinda.

32
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,732
Ah... The seas have quieted.

33
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,610
And only in the sweet
embrace of quietude

34
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,029
can two lovers truly be--

35
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,532
-(saxophone playing)
-Ooh, such noise.

36
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,325
Well, I'm done
for the evening.

37
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,410
Ehh!

38
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,955
Lisa, stop
blowing my sex...

39
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,123
I mean, stop
blowing your sax.

40
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,582
Your sax, stop it.

41
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,959
Mom, I'm auditioning

42
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,627
for first chair
in the school band.

43
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,129
And I've got to practice.

44
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,840
I'm sorry, but I sacrificed
a very expensive camera

45
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,550
just to get some quiet time.

46
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,305
Fine.
I'll play outside.

47
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,769
Hey, why that sounds
like Gabriel's trumpet.

48
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,146
You know that means, kids.

49
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,107
BOTH:
Yay! Judgment day!

50
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,069
45 seconds till pencils down.

51
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,030
Lisa, what's the answer
to number seven?

52
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,282
Sorry, Ralph.

53
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,575
That would defeat
the purpose of testing

54
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,494
as a means
of student evaluation.

55
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,329
My cat's name
is Mittens.

56
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,499
Three, two, one, and
that's pencils down.

57
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,084
(all moaning)

58
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,962
Now, here's an oral
extra credit question.

59
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,630
What was
Christopher Columbus

60
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,008
actually looking for
when he discovered America?

61
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,634
Ooh, ooh!

62
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,678
Anyone besides
Lisa for a change?

63
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,263
Enh, enh, enh!

64
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,265
MRS. HOOVER: Ralph, this better
not be about your cat.

65
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,767
Oh, all right, Li--

66
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,436
Columbus was looking
for a passage to India.

67
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,479
Oh, correct, Allison.

68
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,523
And on your very
first day in our class.

69
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,150
And during a subsequent voyage,

70
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,944
Columbus found what is now
the continent of South America.

71
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,487
Yowee.

72
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,698
I never made
Miss Hoover "yowee."

73
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,286
Hi, Allison.
I'm Lisa Simpson.

74
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,787
Oh, it's great
to finally meet someone

75
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,707
who converses above
the normal eight-year-old level.

76
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,209
Actually, I'm seven.

77
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,793
I was just skipped ahead

78
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,587
because I was getting bored
with the first grade.

79
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,505
You're younger than me too?

80
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,970
Are you hyperventilating?

81
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,806
No. I just like
to smell my lunch.

82
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,976
Gee, I never met anyone
who skipped a grade before.

83
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,478
I'm surprised you
haven't been skipped.

84
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,687
You're obviously
smart enough.

85
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,065
Well, I'm sure I could have,

86
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,610
but I'd hate to leave behind
all my wonderful friends.

87
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,654
Out of the way,
brain queen.

88
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,655
Ah!

89
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,657
(chuckles)
Hey, Sarah.

90
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,116
Well, I got to go.

91
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,869
I have to practice
for band auditions.

92
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,163
Me, too. Hey, what
instrument do you play?

93
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,164
The sax.

94
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,582
Me, too.

95
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,583
I'm going for
first chair this year.

96
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,751
Me, too.

97
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,503
Wow, with so much
in common,

98
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,421
I'm sure we'll be
the best of friends.

99
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,464
Me, too.

100
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,715
(half-heartedly)
Me, too.

101
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,137
Hurry up and finish eating.

102
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,847
You're steering fine, boy.

103
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,724
Hard to the right!
Hard to the left!

104
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,726
Cat! Deer! Old man!

105
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,103
(screaming)

106
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,229
Jackknifed sugar truck.

107
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,439
(gasps) Sugar?

108
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,903
Don't worry, buddy.
Here's a quarter.

109
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,071
Call for help
at the nearest phone.

110
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,447
I'll keep an eye
on things here.

111
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,535
If only this sugar were
as sweet as you, sir.

112
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,620
Homer, that was
downright decent of you.

113
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,330
We hit the jackpot here!

114
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,041
White gold, Texas tea...

115
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,376
Sweetener.

116
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,213
(grunting)

117
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,090
Dad, isn't this stealing?

118
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,717
Read your town charter, boy.

119
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,427
"If foodstuff
should touch the ground,

120
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,596
said foodstuff shall be turned
over to the village idiot."

121
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,391
Since I don't see him around,
start shoveling.

122
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,685
(stifled breathing)

123
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,730
(sighs)

124
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,606
-Mom?
-What? What?

125
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,650
Why am I still rotting away
in the second grade

126
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,485
instead of being skipped ahead?

127
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,903
I don't know, honey.

128
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,822
I guess that's the school's
decision to make.

129
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,532
Well, did you ever talk
to anyone at the school?

130
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,284
Make a few calls
on my behalf?

131
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,453
Maybe you could have been "nicer"
to Principal Skinner,

132
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,996
if you know
what I mean.

133
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,999
Lisa... I am nice.

134
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,461
Homer, I really appreciate
you making dinner,

135
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,005
but this food tastes
a little strange.

136
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,631
It hurts my teeth.

137
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,134
That's because
I've loaded it with sugar!

138
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,971
Marge, our ship has come in.

139
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,183
I found 500 pounds of sugar--
in the forest--

140
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,185
that I'm going to sell
directly to the consumer,

141
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,979
and all for a low, low price
of one dollar per pound.

142
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,815
But the grocery store sells
sugar for 35 cents a pound.

143
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,109
And it doesn't have nails
and broken glass in it.

144
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,569
Those are prizes.

145
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,990
Ooh, a blasting cap.

146
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,201
(horn playing)

147
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,205
It's your turn, Jimbo.

148
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,832
Ooh!

149
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,251
Mmm, someone's been
practicing over the summer.

150
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,378
Welcome aboard.

151
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,213
Yes!

152
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,340
-Ooh!
-Ow! My lute!

153
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,175
Mm-hmm.

154
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,719
Lisa Simpson trying
for first chair saxophone.

155
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,390
(playing jazz)

156
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,354
Mmm, very nice.
Now Allison Taylor,

157
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,398
also trying for
first chair saxophone.

158
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,652
(playing jazz)

159
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,201
Oh! This is a very
tough decision, girls.

160
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,577
You're both very good.

161
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,663
(improvises solo)

162
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,879
(applause)

163
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,881
Well, I guess that
clinches that--

164
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,967
(improvises solo)

165
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,267
(applause)

166
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,562
(playing in harmony)

167
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,114
(group gasps)

168
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,994
Oh! That was
a close one, Lisa,

169
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,745
but you made it.

170
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,122
I won first chair?

171
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,457
No, you regained
consciousness.

172
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,749
Allison got first chair.

173
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,127
Ahh!

174
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,884
(mumbles)
Oh, it was just a dream.

175
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,719
Oh, that was
a close one, Lisa,

176
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,970
but you made it.

177
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,346
I won first chair?

178
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,848
No, you regained
consciousness.

179
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,349
Allison got first chair.

180
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,602
And believe me,
this is not a dream!

181
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,228
Ahh!

182
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,986
I need help, Mom.
There's another girl at school

183
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,322
who's smarter, younger, and
a better sax player than me.

184
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,282
Ugh, I feel so average.

185
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,993
Well, you'll always be
number one to me.

186
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:18,039
Ahem! Hello!
Firstborn within earshot.

187
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,374
-I meant my number one girl.
-(pacifier)

188
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:22,835
Oh, for crying...

189
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,172
Honey, if you get
too competitive,

190
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,798
you'll never be happy.

191
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,509
No matter how good you are,

192
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,010
there's always going to be
someone better than you.

193
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,803
I always thought I had
the tallest hair.

194
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,848
But that trip to Graceland
really opened my eyes.

195
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,183
But she's better than me

196
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,976
at everything
that makes me special.

197
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,394
Believe me, honey,

198
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,813
she's more scared of you
than you are of her.

199
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,233
-You're thinking of bears, Mom.
-Hmm.

200
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,692
(doorbell ringing)

201
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,236
Sugar man.

202
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,279
Mmm.

203
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,864
Door-to-door sugar?

204
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,908
Well, marvelous idea.

205
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:54,951
(distant shouting)

206
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:55,952
What's that, Mother?

207
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,161
(distant shouting)

208
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,287
I'm just talking
to the sugar man.

209
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,413
(distant shouting)

210
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,665
Mother, I'm a big boy.

211
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,792
I can do as I wish.
Excuse me.

212
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,462
Thanks a lot, Simpson.
Now I'm grounded.

213
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,342
Hey, Allison, what's
the answer to number nine?

214
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,927
I can't tell
you, Ralph.

215
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,137
I can't tell you
either, Ralph.

216
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,223
Leave me alone.

217
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,307
Brainiac!

218
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,517
Nerd!

219
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,685
You geekazoid!

220
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,686
Leave me alone!

221
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,645
(grunts)

222
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,775
Ah, that used to be
my face in the mud.

223
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,695
I can't stand to see you
so miserable, Lis.

224
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,863
Unless it's from a rubber
spider down your dress.

225
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,240
Ooh, that gives me an idea.

226
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,658
Note for later:

227
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,910
Put rubber spider
down Lisa's dress.

228
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,078
(chuckling)

229
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,625
(chuckling)

230
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,796
Hey, I know.
How about if I dig up

231
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,798
some dirt on Allison?

232
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,217
Remember how I got Milhouse's picture
on "America's Most Wanted?"

233
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,178
There he is,
on the monkey bars.

234
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,972
Try to take him alive.

235
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:58,973
(screaming)

236
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,558
Oh, no! Not again!

237
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,936
(Milhouse shouts)

238
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,396
I appreciate the offer,
but it goes against

239
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,064
every moral fiber
in my body.

240
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,984
Suit yourself.
If you change your mind, here is my card.

241
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,068
I don't need a card.

242
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,361
You live in the
room next to me.

243
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,573
Note: Next year,
order fewer cards.

244
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,658
And you didn't think
I'd make any money.

245
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,536
I found a dollar while
I was waiting for the bus.

246
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,788
While you were out
"earning" that dollar,

247
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,458
you lost $40 by
not going to work.

248
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,585
The plant called and said
if you don't come in tomorrow,

249
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,961
don't bother
coming in Monday.

250
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,880
Woo-hoo!
A four-day weekend!

251
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,259
(groans)

252
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,221
Hey! I am above average.

253
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,015
So what if Allison's
ahead of me.

254
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:44,143
There's no shame
in being second.

255
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,146
<i>MAN: And now, Avis Rent-a-car</i>
<i>is proud to present</i>

256
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,899
<i>the second best band</i>
<i>in America.</i>

257
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,486
<i>Will you welcome Garfunkel,</i>
<i>Messina, Oates and Lisa</i>

258
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:57,740
<i>singing their number two hit</i>
<i>"Born to Runner-up."</i>

259
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,576
(incoherent rock music)

260
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,704
(booing)

261
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,207
Why would they come
to our concert just to boo us?

262
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,000
Lis, I did some checking
on this Allison character,

263
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,628
and I know it's against
all your moral fibers--

264
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,754
Give it to me.

265
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,005
(chuckles)

266
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,132
Hey, wait,
there's nothing bad here.

267
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,218
Yep. She's clean as a bean.

268
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,221
But I did tip off the feds
as to the whereabouts

269
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:23,140
of our good friend Milhouse.

270
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,810
I'm telling you,
I didn't do anything.

271
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:26,602
I don't care.

272
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,106
(inhales)

273
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:34,068
(yelling)

274
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,487
Ouch! My glasses!

275
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,076
Oh, I've got to stop
being so petty.

276
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,037
I should be Allison's friend,
not her competitor.

277
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,831
I mean...

278
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,917
she is a wonderful person.

279
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,252
Way to go, Lis.

280
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,087
I mean, why compete
with someone

281
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,588
who's just gonna kick
your butt anyway?

282
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,091
I prefer my phrasing.

283
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,220
It's great of you
to come over, Lisa.

284
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,139
I really want us
to be friends.

285
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,182
You're a wonderful person.

286
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,727
Hi, Lisa, I'm Allison's father,
Professor Taylor.

287
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,520
I've heard great things
about you.

288
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,355
Oh, really? I...

289
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,232
Well, don't be modest,
I'm glad we have someone

290
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,276
who can join us
in our anagram games.

291
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,236
We take proper names
and rearrange the letters

292
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,196
to form a description
of that person.

293
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,615
Like, oh,
I don't know, uh...

294
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,659
Alec Guinness.

295
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,994
Genuine class.

296
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,662
Ho-ho, very good.

297
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,291
All right, Lisa. Um...
Jeremy Irons.

298
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,796
Jeremy's Iron.

299
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,174
Mm-hmm.

300
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,927
Well, that's very good
for a first try.

301
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,471
You know what?

302
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,431
I have a ball.

303
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,724
Perhaps you'd like
to bounce it.

304
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,275
What's this?

305
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,319
Oh, it's for the school
diorama competition.

306
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,779
You're finished already?

307
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,530
But the competition
isn't for weeks.

308
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,575
Lisa, we're talking dioramas.
Who could wait?

309
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,286
I chose "The Tell-Tale Heart,"
by Edgar Allan Poe.

310
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,122
See, this is the bedroom
where the old man was murdered,

311
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,542
and he's buried here
under the floorboards.

312
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,586
Oh, and look, I used
an old metronome

313
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:20,007
to simulate the heartbeat
that drove the killer insane.

314
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,343
(beating)

315
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,761
Ha ha.
It's neat, huh?

316
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,096
(chuckles nervously)
It's great.

317
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,140
It's really great.

318
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,684
Heh heh. Hmm.

319
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,855
Oh, got away from you, huh?

320
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,149
Well, you keep at it.

321
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,996
Must... protect... sugar.

322
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,790
Thieves everywhere...

323
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,292
The strong
must protect the sweet.

324
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,753
The sweet...

325
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,171
(snoring)

326
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,756
Homer?

327
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,135
(Latin accent) In America,
first you get the sugar,

328
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:10,724
then you get the power,
then you get the women.

329
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,269
Homer!
Homer?

330
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,145
-Wha-what?
-I want you to forget

331
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,564
about guarding
this stupid sugar.

332
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,649
You're being
completely paranoid.

333
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,067
Oh, am I?

334
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,485
Am I really?

335
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,486
Aha!

336
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,529
Hello.

337
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,573
All right, pal.

338
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,866
Where'd you get
the sugar for that tea?

339
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,951
I nicked it when you
let your guard down

340
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,744
for that split second.

341
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,330
And I'd do it again.

342
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,456
Good-bye.

343
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,375
You see, Marge?
You see?

344
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,376
Homer, when are you
going to give up

345
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,003
this crazy sugar scheme?

346
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,004
Never!

347
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,547
Never, Marge.

348
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,300
I can't live
the button-down life like you.

349
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,426
I want it all.

350
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,760
The terrifying lows,

351
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,262
the dizzying highs,

352
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,555
the creamy middles.

353
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:53,267
Sure, I might offend
a few of the bluenoses

354
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,394
with my cocky stride
and musky odors.

355
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:59,899
Oh, I'll never be the darling
of the so-called city fathers,

356
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,568
who cluck their tongues,
stroke their beards,

357
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:06,572
and talk about, "What's to be
done with this Homer Simpson?"

358
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,491
Look, just get rid
of the sugar, okay?

359
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,993
No!

360
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,578
(buzzing)

361
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,291
(screams)

362
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,084
Hey! Get off my sugar!

363
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,628
Bad bees! Bad!

364
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,464
Ow!
Ow!!

365
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,841
Oh, they're defending
themselves somehow.

366
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,845
Look, Bart.
It almost killed me.

367
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,306
But I handcrafted
all 75 characters

368
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,807
from "Oliver Twist."

369
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,518
And now-- The coup de grace,

370
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,229
a bitter snowstorm.

371
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,317
-Mmm.
-Cool.

372
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,401
Uh-oh.

373
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,819
(crashing)

374
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,279
Is it okay?

375
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:51,951
Well, the important thing
is that we survived.

376
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,911
Ah! Who am I kidding?

377
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,497
There's no way I'm ever
gonna beat Allison.

378
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,916
Oh, sure there is.

379
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,503
But it involves being
a bit underhanded,

380
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:06,382
a bit devious, a bit,
as the French say,

381
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,800
Bartesque.

382
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,510
I'll do whatever it takes.

383
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,846
Then welcome to the
nether regions of the soul.

384
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,518
Now, here's what we do.

385
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,436
Tomorrow morning, when Allison
comes out of her house,

386
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,897
we spray her with the hose,

387
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,192
soaking her from head to toe,
leaving us relatively dry.

388
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,777
Relatively?

389
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,320
Well, there's bound to be
some splash-back.

390
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,865
Bart, her being wet won't
help me win the competition.

391
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,868
Well. We could just
sabotage her diorama,

392
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,954
humiliating her in front
of the students and faculty.

393
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,122
Perfect!

394
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,915
Leaving her primed
for the most traumatic

395
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,667
hose-soaking of her life.

396
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,293
Enough with the hose!

397
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,716
Well, it sure is quiet
in here today.

398
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,386
Yes! A little too quiet
if you know what I mean.

399
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,971
Hmm.
I'm afraid I don't.

400
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,349
You see, bees usually make
a lot of noise.

401
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,517
(loudly)
No noise...

402
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,352
suggests no bees.

403
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,813
Oh, I understand now.

404
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,106
Oh, look.
There goes one.

405
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,107
To the Beemobile!

406
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,775
You mean your Chevy?

407
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,152
Yes.

408
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,362
Well, very clever, Simpson.

409
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,322
Luring our bees
to your sugar pile,

410
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,533
and then selling them back
to us at an inflated price.

411
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,868
Bees are on the what now?

412
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,787
Simpson, you diabolical...

413
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,332
We're willing to pay you
$2,000 for this swarm.

414
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,667
Deal!

415
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,337
Oh, wait a minute.

416
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,380
The bees are leaving.

417
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,008
No!

418
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,677
My sugar is melting.

419
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,430
Melting! Oh, what a world.

420
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:42,061
(sobbing)
The sugar's gone.

421
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,729
I'm sorry, Homie.

422
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:44,980
It's okay, Marge.

423
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,607
I've learned my lesson.

424
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,277
A mountain of sugar
is too much for one man.

425
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,695
It's clear now why God

426
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,448
portions it out
in those tiny packets,

427
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,826
and why He lives on
a plantation in Hawaii.

428
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,289
Ah, "Diorama-rama,"
My favorite school event,

429
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,957
next to
"Hearing Test Thursday."

430
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,292
"The Grapes of Wrath?"

431
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,293
I don't get it.

432
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,628
Here's the grapes.

433
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,506
And here's the wrath.

434
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,590
ALL:
Ew!

435
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:12,633
Ha-ha!

436
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,468
Yes, yes, very good wrath.

437
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,471
Ah, let's see, our foreign
exchange student Üter

438
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:21,225
has chosen "Charlie
and the Chocolate Factory."

439
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,601
I...

440
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,561
But this is just an empty box.

441
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,856
I begged you
to look at mine first.

442
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,024
I begged you.

443
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,235
Lisa.

444
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,820
Here is,
as the French say,

445
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,696
le fake diorama.

446
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,324
I'll create a diversion,
and you make the switch.

447
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,493
Hey, everybody!

448
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,577
Whoa! Look at me.

449
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,870
I'm over here.

450
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,039
Turn this way right now!

451
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,582
Hey, it's Bart.

452
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,709
And he's doing stuff.

453
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,044
(talking and shouting)

454
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,508
SKINNER:
Bart, stop creating

455
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,385
a diversion
and get out of here.

456
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,594
(crowing)

457
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,308
Okay, our next entry is
"The Tell-Tale Heart"

458
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,893
from Allison Taylor.

459
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,145
Mmm, I can't wait
to see this.

460
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,104
Be ready with the ribbon.

461
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,023
ALL:
Eww...

462
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,817
-Ew.
-What is it?

463
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,610
(disguised voice)
It's a cow's heart.

464
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,905
They're trying to make
a monkey out of you.

465
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,616
Allison, is this
supposed to be

466
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,868
some kind of joke?

467
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,954
I didn't do that.

468
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,497
I made a different one.

469
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,915
Oh, is that so, young lady?

470
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,209
Well, where is
this phantom diorama?

471
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,670
I--I don't know.

472
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:35,549
(heart beating)

473
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,721
At least have the guts
to take the blame, girl.

474
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,973
You're compounding
your folly by lying about it.

475
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,892
-Right on.
-Young lady, cow hearts

476
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,520
belong in a butcher's window,
not the classroom.

477
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,939
Well, maybe in an older student's
biology classroom,

478
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,399
but that's
none of my business.

479
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,276
Elementary school
is where I wound up,

480
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,986
and it's too late
to do anything about that.

481
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,780
(exhales)

482
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,240
Frankly, I'm starting to
regret skipping you ahead.

483
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,871
(heart beating)

484
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,879
Ah!

485
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,673
It's the beating
of that hideous heart!

486
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,469
I mean, I think
I hear something.

487
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,307
Why, here's Allison's
real diorama.

488
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,727
It got misplaced,
or so it would seem.

489
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,687
Oh, well, that changes
everything.

490
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,481
Let's have a look.
Get the ribbon ready.

491
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,691
-(ticking)
-Oh.

492
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:39,196
A little sterile,
no real insight.

493
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,739
What do you think,
Miss Hoover?

494
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,698
Eh...

495
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,784
Eh? Oh.

496
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,744
This has been
a very disappointing day.

497
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,913
All right,
on to Lisa Simpson.

498
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,623
You're a shoo-in
now, Lis.

499
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,251
After the way I've behaved,
I don't deserve to win.

500
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,795
-Well, this doesn't deserve to win.
-What?

501
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,797
Ooh, now we're
into the dregs.

502
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,799
Here's Ralph Wiggum's
entry.

503
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:02,427
Prepackaged "Star Wars" characters
still in their display box?

504
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,388
Are those the limited edition
action figures?

505
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,973
What's a diorama?

506
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,059
Why, it's Luke and Obi-wan
and my favorite, Chewie.

507
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,769
They're all here!

508
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:11,770
What do you think?

509
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:12,771
I think it's lunchtime.

510
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,065
We have a winner.

511
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:18,694
(cheering)

512
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,404
(bell ringing)

513
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,699
I'm really sorry
about what I did, Allison.

514
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,159
It's no shame
being second to you.

515
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,786
Thank you, Lisa.

516
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,247
You know, I'm actually
kind of glad I lost.

517
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,667
Now I know losing isn't
the end of the world.

518
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,044
Hey, you still think
we can be friends?

519
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,130
Only if we're the best.

520
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,675
(Ralph chanting) I beat the smart kids.
I beat the smart kid--

521
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,469
Oh!
I bent my wookiee.

522
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,305
Hey, Ralph, want to come
with me and Allison

523
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,848
to play anagrams?

524
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,641
We take proper names
and rearrange the letters

525
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,852
to form a description
of that person.

526
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,354
My cat's breath
smells like cat food.
