He said Ted Kennedy

Yeah, switch the station.

15
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,204
I consider myself
politically correct,

16
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,790

No, no, no, no, guys.

18
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,044
Now, I'm not very political.

19
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,129
I usually think
people who vote

20
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,797
are a bit fruity,

21
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,299
but for some reason,

22
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,885
this Birch Barlow 
really speaks to me.

23
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,641
Good morning,
fellow freedom likers.

24
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,352
Birch Barlow, the fourth branch
of government-- The 51st state.

25
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,396
You know,
there are three things

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,065
we're never gonna get rid of
here in Springfield.

27
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,442
One-- The bats
in the public library.

28
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,902
(screaming)

29
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,488

<i>the illiterate, tax-cheating,</i>
<i>wife-swapping, pot-smoking</i>

33
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:24,542

34
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,711
Hey, I am no longer
illiterate.

35
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,881
Now, why are we doomed
to this Quimby quagmire, you ask,

36
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,466
oh, reasonable listener?

37
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,761
Because this town
is under the stranglehold

38
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,097
of a few tie-dyed tree huggers

39
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,474
who would rather play hacky sack
than lock up the homeless.

40
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,892
Mmm...

41
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,894
this sounds
awfully controversial.

42
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,815
Lisa, you know I don't like
controversy in this house.

43
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,775
I don't like him either, Mom,

44
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,486
but I'm doing a report on
local politics for my school project.

45
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,530
You think you're so big

46
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,782
'cause your class
always gets to do projects.

47
00:01:55,865 --> 00:02:00,286

-(Marge groans)

49
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,833
Bart, I wish you
wouldn't lie like that.

50
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,671

58
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,104

00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,094
Now, honestly, what is that?

123
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,222

Oh, really now,
this is a personal call!

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,812
My-my-my friends,

165
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:10,805
Now then, gentlemen,
the mayoral campaign is upon us,

166
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,682
and if we hope to defeat
this Joe Quimby,

167
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,935
we need a candidate with name
recognition and media savvy--

168
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,896
a true leader who will do
exactly as he's told.

169
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,107
Monty, I'm way ahead of you.

170
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,692
If you'll just open that door,

171
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,153
you'll see the next
mayor of Springfield.

172
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,826
-MAN: Very nice.
-(gurgles)

173
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,786
-What'd it say?
-No, no, no.

174
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,496
Bob. Bob, come in.

175
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,834
A fine Mahoke to you all.

176
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,669
Why, he's even better.

177
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,670
I agree.

178
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,755
I like the human touch.

179
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,716
PRINCIPAL SKINNER:
Now, students,

180
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,051
I want you to be
on your best behavior

181
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,345
for this carefully
choreographed media event.

182
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,723
Now, this means there is to be
no wising off, no face making,

183
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,266
and no grass eating.

184
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,809
This means you, Ralph.

185
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:57,894
Yes, sir.

186
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,061
Hello, children.

187
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,189
-Hello, Bart.
-Eep.

188
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,482
Young friends,

189
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,275
my opponent, Joe Quimby,

190
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,652
is confused
about your school system.

191
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,946
Do you know what he does?
He flip-flops.

192
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,865
Hey, ya, hi, ya, ho, ho.

193
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,950
(kids gasping)

194
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:17,455
Sometimes he doesn't know
whether he's coming or going.

195
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,123
(kids cheering)

196
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,754
He wants to sell
your future short.

197
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:29,133
(cheering)

198
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,553
Hmm. Bart, we can't let Bob
steal the spotlight.

199
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,847
We're gonna have to stoop to
the lowest common denominator.

200
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,224
I can do that.

201
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,893
Ahh! Help!

202
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,145
I'm being attacked by,
uh, things.

203
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,605
(Lisa and Bart laugh)

204
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,358
Uncle Mayor was just
saying that us kids

205
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,402
are the most important
natural resource we have.

206
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,946
More important than coal?

207
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,822
Uh, er, uh, yes.

208
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,575
-(crowd murmuring)
-(grunts)

209
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,497
Oh, that was a big
mistake, Bart.

210
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,998
No children

211
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,625
have ever meddled
with the Republican Party

212
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,126
and lived to tell about it.

213
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,172
(gasps)

214
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,385
(grunts)

215
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,429
(grunts)

216
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,641
Uh, stay out of Riverdale.

Hey, beard-o,
vote Quimby.

227
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,376
This time he's
the lesser of two evils.

228
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,712
Uh, yeah. Yeah.
I love Grimby.

229
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:51,382
Uh, could I have some more
bumper stickers, please, dude?

230
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,597
All right.

231
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,726
The mummy's ready
for his mystical journey.

232
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,893
(screaming)

233
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,813
What's happening?!

234
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,566
That Quimby fella
promised to build us

235
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,153
a Matlock Expressway.

236
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,364
How you going to
top that, smart guy?

237
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,949
Hmm. Well, how's this?

238
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,118
I'll not only build
the expressway,

239
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,911
I will spend the remainder
of this afternoon

240
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,498
patiently listening
to your interminable anecdotes.

241
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,750
Hot-diggity-damn!

242
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,752
Me first!

243
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,129
Not many people know

244
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:34,050
I owned the first radio
in Springfield.

245
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,636
Weren't much
on the air then,

246
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,513
just Edison reciting
the alphabet

247
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,807
over and over.

248
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,226
"A," he'd say.

249
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,854
Then, "B."

250
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,190
"C" would
usually follow...

251
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,941
(groaning)

252
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,735

257
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,171
The League of Uninformed
Voters presents

258
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,090
the Springfield Mayoral Debates.

259
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,008
I'm your moderator, Larry King.

260
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,635
Now a word to our audience.

261
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,179
Even though we're being
broadcast on Fox,

262
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,182
there's no need for
obnoxious hooting and hollering.

263
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,600
(hooting and hollering)

264
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,227
(groaning)

265
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,396
(whirring)

266
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,402
(sneezes)

267
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,570
I shouldn't have shaken hands
with those old people.

268
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,534
(groaning)

269
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,161
I hope that flu doesn't
affect his performance out there.

270
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,248
Don't worry. He's taken
a million of these capsules.

271
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,710
(groaning)

272
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,919
Uh...

273
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,632
Sideshow Bob,
Councilman Les Whinen

274
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,052
says that you're not
experienced enough to be mayor.

275
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,221
Sir, what do you have to say
about that?

276
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,933
I'd say that Les Whinen
ought to do more thinking

277
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,227
and less whinin'.

278
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,771
(laughter)

279
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,149
There's no
Councilman Les Whinen.

280
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,483
Good line, though.

281
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,694
Mayor Quimby,
you are well-known, sir,

282
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,363
for your lenient stance
on crime,

283
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:23,617
but suppose for a second
that your house was ransacked by thugs,

284
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,996
your family tied up in the basement
with socks in their mouths.

285
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,748
You try to open the door,

286
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,499
but there's
too much blood on the knob...

287
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,001
What is your question?

288
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,502
My question's about
the budget, sir.

289
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,504
(groaning)

290
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,017
Hmm...

291
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,145
I don't agree with his
"Bart-killing policy,"

292
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:55,441
but I do approve
of his "Selma-killing policy."

293
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,943
Well, he framed me
for armed robbery,

294
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:03,032
but, man, I'm aching
for that upper-class tax cut.

295
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,617
(clamoring)

296
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,702
Shh, shh.
Quiet down.

297
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,621
<i>And the results are in.</i>

298
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,289
<i>For Sideshow Bob, 100%.</i>

299
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,291
<i>For Joe Quimby, 1%.</i>

300
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,794
<i>And we remind you there is</i>
<i>a one-percent margin of error.</i>

301
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,754
(groaning)

302
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,552
<i>All right. Let's go live</i>
<i>to Bob headquarters now</i>

303
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,387
<i>for Mayor Terwilliger's</i>
<i>victory speech.</i>

304
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,601
(clearing throat)

305
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,394
(loud laughing)

306
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,903
BROCKMAN: 
<i>And just look how happy he is.</i>

307
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,333
(machinery rumbling)

308
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,919
(screaming)
It's the rapture! Quick!

309
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,963
Get Bart out of the house
before God comes!

310
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,300
So sorry, Mr. Simpson.

311
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,969
Your house is
blocking construction

312
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,679
of our new Matlock Expressway.

313
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,850
Now, I am a fair man.

314
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,435
You will have 72 hours
to vacate.

315
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,354
At the time,
we will blow up your house

316
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,273
and any remaining Simpsons.

317
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,483
Homer, we've got
to stop them.

318
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,236
I know what you're up to,
Mayor Terwigiger,

319
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,406
and no one in my family's
gonna stand for it.

320
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,784
-(horn honks)
-Move your gol'dern house, son!

321
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,331
Bart, by special request

322
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,126
to the mayor's office,
you are going to be left back.

323
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,462
Oh... you mean I have
to repeat the fourth grade?

324
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,464
Well, yes, but
not for four or five years.

325
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,466
Bart, you're going
to kindergarten.

326
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,176
Kindergarten?

327
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,595
Ha!

328
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:51,223
Now, boys and girls,
who knows what this is?

329
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,851
-Triangle.
-Very good, Bart.

330
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,645
You have first choice of toys
for free play.

331
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,439
Cool.
I call the Flintstone phone.

332
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,401
<i>Yabba-dabba do.</i>

333
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,445
<i>I like talking to you.</i>

334
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,905
(chuckles)

335
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,074
We're going to lose our house

336
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,242
and end up living
under a bridge

337
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,785
like common trolls.

338
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,663
I don't think Bob won
that election legally.

339
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,915
I can't believe
a convicted felon

340
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,458
would get so many votes

341
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,460
and another convicted felon
would get so few.

342
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,049
Here you go.

343
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,509
The results of last month's
mayoral election.

344
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,179
All 48,000 voters
and who each one they voted for.

345
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,889
I thought this
was a secret ballot.

346
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,475
-Meh.
-(groaning)

347
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,189
Okay.

348
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,651
Aaron A. Aaronson voted
for... Bob.

349
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:48,864
Aaron L. Aaronson voted
for... Bob.

350
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:53,661
Arthur B. Ablabab voted
for... Bob.

351
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,663
(groaning)

352
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,624
(snoring)

353
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,545
Hey.

354
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,217
(gasps)

355
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,135
BART: So whoever
it is who wrote that note

356
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,096
wants to meet us here tonight?

357
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,556
This is so cool, Bart.

358
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,850
We're just like
Woodward and Bernstein.

359
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,228
Yeah, except their dad wasn't waiting
in the car reading Archie comics.

360
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,731
Stuck-up Riverdale punks
think they're too good for me.

361
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,732
(breathing heavily)

362
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,859
You're on the right track.

363
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,528
Follow the names.

364
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,737
How the hell
do you know?

365
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:37,413
I can't tell you who I am,
but I worked on the campaign.

366
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,539
(tires squealing,
horn honking)

367
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,708
Hey, Mr. Smithers!

368
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,420
Well, you might as well
give me a ride home now.

369
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,464
I've never gone behind
Mr. Burns' back before,

370
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,342
but Sideshow Bob's
ultra-conservative views

371
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,928
conflict with my choice
of lifestyle.

372
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,930
(clears throat)

373
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,225
All I can do is give you
one name-- Edgar Neubauer.

374
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,644
Find him,
and you'll find your answer.

375
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:06,859
(moaning)

376
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,736
No Edgar Neubauer.

377
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,198
(evil chuckling)

378
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,119
(screaming)

379
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,872
This is hopeless.
They're going to demolish

380
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,206
our house for sure.

381
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,083
We're gonna have to move
into a Motel 6.

382
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,253
But Dad can't afford
six dollars a night.

383
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,464
Hey... Lise!

384
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,673
Lise, come here.

385
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,632
I found him.

386
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,925
I found Edgar Neubauer.

387
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,847
Oh, my God--
The dead have risen,

388
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,474
and they're
voting Republican.

389
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,309
(gasps)
No, Bart, don't you see?

390
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,811
Dead people can't vote.

391
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,107
Look. Prudence Goodwyfe,
died 1641.

392
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,193
She voted for Bob, too.

393
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:53,739
So did Buddy Holly,
Ritchie Valens, and The Big Bopper.

394
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,283
Even the pet cemetery
voted for Bob.

395
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,035
(gasps) Look!
Mr. and Mrs. Bananas,

396
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,162
Humphrey Boa-gart.

397
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,623
Oh, my poor dead kitty.

398
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,249
Please, not you, too.

399
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,544
All right, Bob.

400
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,505
Now it's personal.

401
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,758
Hey. Um...
he did try to kill me.

402
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,769
Whoa!

403
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,446
(citizens gasp)

404
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:44,498
Mr. Mayor, is it true
you rigged the election?

405
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,457
No, I did not.

406
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,293
Kids, help.

407
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,881
Oh, I don't mind.

408
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,759
We want these children to feel
justice has been served.

409
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,095
That way they can
sleep soundly tonight

410
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:02,141
on their hard, feculent,
motel pillows.

411
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:06,770
Well, Bart, Lisa, here I am.

412
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,815
I have a plan.
I think we can trap him.

413
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,364
You know, Sideshow Bob,
I believe you

414
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,615
when you say you're innocent.

415
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,700
Indeed, I am.

416
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,201
Because we all know

417
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,662
you're a naive pawn--
puppet, if you will--

418
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,831
of the most diabolical
political genius

419
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,083
Springfield has ever known.

420
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,586
Birchibald T. Barlow.

421
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,087
(people gasping)

422
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,465
(stuttering)

423
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,800
You don't have
the intelligence

424
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,219
to rig an election by yourself,
do you?

425
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,263
You were just
Barlow's lackey.

426
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,431
You were Ronnie
to his Nancy.

427
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,724
Sonny to his Cher.

428
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,559
Ringo to his
rest of the Beatles.

429
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,395
Enough! Lies! Lies! Lies!

430
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,646
I did it!

431
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,898
I did it all!

432
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,733
(people gasping)

433
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,151
There.

434
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,444
Is that what you want,

435
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,487
you smarmy little bastards?

436
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,697
We want the truth.

437
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,324
You want the truth?

438
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,242
You can't handle the truth.

439
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,369
No truth-handler, you.

440
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:09,124
Bah! I deride your
truth-handling abilities.

441
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,500
Will you get
to the point?

442
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,836
Yes.
Only I could have executed

443
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,215
such a masterpiece
of electoral fraud

444
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,133
and I have the records
to prove it.

445
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,135
Here, just look at these.

446
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,931
Each one a work
of Machiavellian art.

447
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,475
Hmm...

448
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,771
-But why?
-Because you need me, Springfield.

449
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:34,650
Your guilty conscience
may force you to vote democratic,

450
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,070
but deep down inside, you secretly
long for a cold-hearted republican

451
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,113
to lower taxes,
brutalize criminals

452
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,907
and rule you like a king.

453
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,450
That's why I did this--

454
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,827
To protect you from yourselves.

455
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,830
Now if you don't mind,
I have a city to run.

456
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,958
Bailiffs,
place the mayor under arrest.

457
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,044
What? Oh, yes.
All that stuff I did.

458
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,798
Bart, we did it.

459
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,132
Now we get to keep
our house

460
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,884
and you get to go back
to the fourth grade.

461
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,594
Oh... tomorrow
we were gonna find out

462
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,471
who the dish ran away with.

463
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,973
The spoon, Bart.

464
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,432
Of course.

465
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,229
(growling)

466
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,315
Someday,
I'll have my vengeance.

467
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,734
Someday, when I find
my way out

468
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,320
of this savage,
roach-ridden cesspool...

469
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,448
Say, Terwilliger's
a Yalie.

470
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,325
Bob! Come along!

471
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,578
We need a ninth to row
against the Princeton alums.

472
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,871
Princeton?

473
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,081
(growling)

474
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,252
Stroke, stroke...
