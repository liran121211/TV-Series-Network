Well, you're certainly doing
your job today, Mr. Sun.

Oh, rats.

8
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,214
And here we have
the world-famous Beatles,

exactly as they looked

10
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,428
performing on
"The Ed Sullivan Show."

11
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,930
I hardly think it's fair
to be charged full price.

00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,684

It's cool in here, boy.

For the rest of the summer,

17
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,703
we can live inside
the refrigerator.

18
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,874
Homer, the fridge wasn't
meant to be used this way.

19
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,211
Although I must say,
it's certainly refreshing.

20
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,761
I got the idea
when I noticed

21
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,763
the refrigerator was cold.

22
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,389

Ugh!

38

Aw, face it, Bart.

39
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,526
Our salvation isn't
just going to roll by

40
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,778

Pool-mobile?!

43
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,713

five bathing suits.

Ooh!

49
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,558
I brought this on myself.

50
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,643
Okay, little dudes, time's up.

51
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,687
Everybody out!

52
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,522

53
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,984
-Time's up?!
-So long, Lis.

54
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,402
I'm gonna stowaway underwater,

55
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,155
and go where the pool goes.
Have a good life.

56
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,037
Sorry, Bart dude.

57
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,580
We got to fill this
with epsom salts

58
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,707
and jam it on over
to the old folks' home.

59
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,709
Oh, well. Same time
tomorrow, Otto?

60
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,753
Ha ha ha!
No way, man.

61
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,756
One day of summer is
all we're budgeted for.

62
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,674
I guess it is
kind of a tease.

63
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,720

64
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,763

Dad!

67
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,102
Yes, Lisa.

68
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,230
Dad, as you know,
we've been swimming,

69
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,856
and we've developed
a taste for it.

70
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,691
We both agree that
getting our own pool

71
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,401
is the only way to go.

72
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,278
Now before you respond,
you must understand

73
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,448
that your refusal would result
in months and months of...

74
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,116
BOTH: Can we have a pool, Dad?!
Can we have a pool, Dad?!

75
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,952
Can we have a pool, Dad?!
Can we have a pool, Dad?!

76
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,329
Can we have a pool, Dad?!
Can we--

77
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,580
I understand.

78
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,708
Let us celebrate
our new arrangement

79
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,044
with the adding
of chocolate to milk.

80
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,133
Over here we have
"The Hick Tub"

The "Insta-rust."

82
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,387
That's "The Lightning Magnet."

83
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,806
-That's "The Tinkler."
-Whoo! "The Tinkler."

84
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,308
I like the sound of that.
We'll take it.

85
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,979
Is it true should we wait at least
an hour after eating before we go in?

86
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,856
Look, question lady, this job
is not what I really do, okay?

87
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,983
I play keyboards.

88
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,624
HOMER:
All right.

89
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,584
Everybody in the pool!

90
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,671
'Tis a fine barn, but sure
'tis no pool, English.

91
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,672
D'oh-eth!

92
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,259
-Is it a pool yet?
-Yes, Dad.

93
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,260
Whoo-hoo!

94

95

Uh, hello, uh,
Mrs., uh, Bart.

97
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,436
Is your pool ready yet?

99
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,945
Bart, are all these children
friends of yours?

100
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,740
Friends
and well-wishers, yes.

101
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,866
-Hey, Bart.
-Hiya, Bart.

102
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,200
-My buddy Bart.
-Hey, Bart.

103
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,286
Hello, Mrs. Cumberdale.

People! People!

106
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,420
It's time we all discussed
the pool safety rules.

107
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,464
ALL:
Jump, Bart, jump!

108
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,424
Jump, Bart, jump!

109
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,051
You got it.

110
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,846
Hey, Bart,
your epidermis is showing!

111
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:47,930
It is?

112
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:48,890
Oh... Ooh.

113
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,935
Whoa...

114
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,812
See, epidermis
means your hair.

115
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,856
(Bart screaming)

116
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,024
(thuds)

117
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,817
So, technically it's true.

118
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,361
That's what makes it
so funny.

119
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,987
Pardon me a moment.

120
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,406
Ha-ha.

121
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,909
Hey, Nelson,
he's really hurt.

122
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,994
I think he
broke his leg.

123
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,788
I said, "Ha-ha!"

124
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:30,139
Get this kid a magazine.
Stat.

125
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,976
I'm sorry, that leg's
gonna have to come off.

126
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,312
-(both gasp)
-(chuckles)

127
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,647
Did I say leg?

128
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,857
I meant that wet bathing suit.

129
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,111
I'm afraid you'll need a cast
on that broken bone.

130
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,905
Oh, I'm going to miss
the whole summer.

131
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,698
Don't worry, boy.

132
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,868
When you get a job like me,
you'll miss every summer.

133
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,704
Isn't it amazing the same day
you got a pool

134
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,957
is the same day we realized
we liked you?

135
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,334
The timing worked out great,
don't you think?

136
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,919
-Hi.
-Hi.

137
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,629
Hey, guys, sign my cast?

138
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,047

Uh... Hi, Bart.

143
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,181
Faithful Milhouse.

144
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,684
You'll spend the long,
hot days by my side,

145
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,060
won't you?

146
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,688
Oh, I think I lost
my glasses in your pool.

147
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,022
I better go in
and find them.

148
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,816
But you're wearing
your glasses.

149
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,151
No, I'm not.

150
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,947
Oh, look,
Bart's all alone.

151
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,490
Maybe I should
keep him company,

152
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,033
at least
for a little while.

158
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,221
Oh, great, I get to spend
the summer with my brain.

159
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,473
What fun can you have
in a pool anyway

160
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,558
that you can't have
in a bathtub

161
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,935
with a garbage bag
taped around your cast?

162
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,437

musical extravaganza)

164
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,103
Traitors.

165
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,730
Go on and have your pool.

166
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,483

You know, this isn't so bad.

174
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,086
I'll just spend the summer
getting better acquainted

175
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,505

called television.

00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,767
<i>(groans)</i>

182
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,228
<i>Classic Krusty.</i>

183
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,771
<i>Enjoy.</i>

184
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,358
<i>(chuckling)</i>

185
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,152
<i>Good evening.</i>

186
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,572
<i>Tonight my guest is AFL-CIO</i>
<i>chairman, George Meany,</i>

187
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,157
<i>who will be discussing</i>

188
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,908
<i>collective bargaining</i>
<i>agreements.</i>

189
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,785
<i>It's a pleasure</i>
<i>to be here, Krusty.</i>

190
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,329
<i>Let me be blunt.</i>

191
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,123
<i>Is there a labor crisis</i>
<i>in America today?</i>

192
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,334
<i>Well, that depends what</i>
<i>you mean by crisis.</i>

193
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,668
(groans)

194
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,589
Ah, there's nothing like
rising with the sun

195
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:36,260
for a quiet, peaceful dip
in your very own pool.

196
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,597
(whooping)

197
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,556
Whoo!

198
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,600
(shrieking)

199
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,769
Eww...

200
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,395
Lisa, the blob has got me.

201
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,606
Don't touch me,
or he'll get you too.

202
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,359
Dad, you have to put chlorine
in the water every day

203
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,943
to keep it clean.

204
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,404
Chlorine, eh?

205
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,616
(all bawling)

206
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,618
Oh, my face is on fire.

207
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,911
(groans)

208
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,163
Oh, look.
There's Bart.

209
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,414
Wave to him.

210
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,628
Hmm, maybe we should spend
more time with Bart.

211
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,631
He's becoming
isolated and weird.

212
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,467
I swear I don't know
where the bombs are.

213
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,636
Only the miners know that.

214
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,806
(evil voice)
Maybe this will loosen your tongue.

215
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,557
Wha! No! Ah!

216
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,934
Uh, Bart?

217
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,060
Don't turn on
that light!

218
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,561
Sorry, I just came to see

219
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,605
-how you were feeling.
-I'm fine. Just fine.

220
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,691
What are you writing here?
A play?

221
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,067
Uh... No.

222
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,779
Yuh-huh. "Cast of characters:
Viceroy Fizzlebottom

223
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,947
a hearty cherub
of a man..."

224
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,948
Give me that.

225
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,700
It's a work in progress.

226
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,161
So, how do
you like being

227
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,663
Miss Popularity?

228
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,249
Oh, well, you know,
it ain't so great.

229
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,585
Bart, it's the best thing
that ever happened to me

230
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,087
in my whole life!

231
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,047
Well, anyway I brought
you a present.

232
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,634
Look, it's the telescope
I won at the optics festival.

233
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,637
There was an optics festival,
and I wasn't informed?

234
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,763
-You go now.
-But...

235
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,723
Go!

236
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,686
What have we here?

237
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,981
"The Lighter Side of Hippies."

238
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,400
Ha ha! They don't care
whose toes they step on.

239
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,235
(chuckles)

240
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,612
(Marge and Homer laughing)

241
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,078
MARGE:
This was a lovely idea, Homie.

242
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,789
Come here and kiss me.

243
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,417
Mmm...

244
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,544
(screaming)

245
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,546
CHIEF WIGGUM:
<i>Do not be alarmed.</i>

246
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,131
<i>Continue swimming naked.</i>

247
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,674
(munching)

248
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,011
<i>Aw, come on. Continue.</i>

249
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,722
<i>Come on. Aw...</i>

250
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,640
All right, Lou. Open fire.

251
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,772
BART:
Wow.

252
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,982
The universe is so boring.

253
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,776
I know.

254
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,488
I'll use this to peer into
Springfield's seamy underbelly.

255
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,912
(Bart groans)

256
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,955
<i>It turned out it was</i>
<i>his evil twin.</i>

257
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,957
(chuckling)

258
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,292
(Bart groans)

259
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,545
(Jimmy Stewart voice)
Grace, come here.

260
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,006
There's a sinister-looking kid
I want you to see.

261
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,674
(Bart groans)

262
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,594
I'm never ever going to see
anything interesting

263
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,721
with this stupid piece of junk.

264
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,935
(high-pitched scream)

265
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,521
That came from Flanders' house.

266
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,317
Oh...

267
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,860
(high-pitched scream)

268
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,906
Oh, my God.

269
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:44,907
What have I done?

270
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,534
I've killed her.

271
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,453
Can't be what it looks like.

272
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,289
This is Flanders
we're talking about.

273
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,916
Nah, I'll just watch some TV.

274
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,293
<i>Now, what you've been</i>
<i>waiting for.</i>

275
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,712
<i>Another long raga</i>
<i>by Ravi Shanker.</i>

276
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,798
<i>Shan-kar.</i>

277
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,675
<i>Shankar. Groovy, man.</i>

278
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,343
(groans)

279
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,427
(snoring)

280
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,470
(noise outside)

281
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,596
Huh?

282
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,978
BART:
Huh? Whoa!

283
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,646
This can't be what
it looks like.

284
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,648
There's got to be
some other explanation.

285
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:21,443
I wish there was
some other explanation for this.

286
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,903
But there isn't.

287
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,155
I'm a murderer.
I'm a murderer.

288
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,950
Then that's not
the real Ned Flanders.

289
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,953
I'm a murdiddly-erdler!

290
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,873
If that's not Flanders,
he's done his homework.

291
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,297
Daddy, where's Mommy?
We miss her.

292
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,925
Mommy... had to go away.
She's with God now.

293
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,177
BOTH:
Yay! Can we go there too?

294
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,470
Soon enough.

295
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,014
BOTH:
Yay!

296
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,473
(gasping)

297
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,559
He's going to kill
Rod and Todd too.

298
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,061
That's horrible...

299
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,021
in principle.

300
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,524
Look, Lisa.
I found this change

301
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,942
on the bottom
of the pool.

302
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,444
You can have it.

303
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,487
Thanks, Nelson.

304
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,991
Somebody took
my juice money!

305
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,786
Lisa, please join my family
for a weekend in the country.

306
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,538
There'll be hunting, charades,

307
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,042
and ever so many delightful
romantic misunderstandings.

308
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,170
(clamoring for attention)

309
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,505
<i>They're only using you</i>
<i>for your pool, you know.</i>

310
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,924
Shut up, brain!
I got friends now.

311
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,967
I don't need you anymore.

312
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:31,263
Duh... Yeah, I'd love
to go to your house.

313
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,848
(chortling)

314
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,436
Ah, my plan
has come to fruition.

315
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,897
Soon I'll be queen
of summertime.

316
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,315
Uh, king. King!

317
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,529
(whispering)

318
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,449
Dude, Buzz has it
an even wussier kid

319
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,118
has an even better pool
than this.

320
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,792
Huh?

321
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,961
Hello?

322
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,046
Hey, I'm stuck in here.

323
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,423
I got to think
of a way to get out.

324
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,758
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

325
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,761
<i>Look who's come crawling back.</i>

326
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,806
Listen, Ned Flanders
murdered his wife.

327
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,266
But why?
She's such a fox.

328
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,143
I mean, what's
on Fox tonight?

329
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,979
Something ribald,
no doubt.

330
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,898
I wish you'd stop spreading
bad rumors about people.

331
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,359
Remember how you got Grampa
tarred and feathered?

332
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,361
Sure. That was
20 minutes ago.

333
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:31,031
Gonna be in the tub
for a while.

334
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,450
Bart, I'm really sorry I've
been ignoring you lately.

335
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,911
I got carried away
with being popular,

336
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,997
but now that I'm
unpopular again,

337
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,124
I want you to know
I'm here for you.

338
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,084
You can start making it up
to me right now.

339
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,752
Flanders is leaving
the house.

340
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,045
I want you to sneak in there

341
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,964
and bring me back
some evidence.

342
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,340
And something
sweet for later.

343
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,758
Bart, I'm here for you,
but I'm not gonna

344
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,135
break into
somebody's house.

345
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,761
All right.
You're right, you're right.

346
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,513
Let's just forget about that.
Here.

347
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,473
Let me read to you
from my play.

348
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,309
Ahem. (Cockney accent)
"'Kippers for breakfast, Aunt Helga?

349
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,312
Is it St. Swithen's
day already?'"

350
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,189
"'Tis,' replied
Aunt Helga..."

351
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,525
I'm going, I'm going!

352
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,538
(gasps)

353
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,248
(gasps)
A human head!

354
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,752
Phew!

355
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,128
Oh. Of course.

356
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,758
Oh, no. He's back.
Flanders is back.

357
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,134
Lisa, get out of there.

358
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,554
No, Lisa, don't go upstairs.
You'll be trapped!

359
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,559
An axe!
He's got an axe.

360
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,061
I'll save you, Lisa.

361
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,562
Ow!

362
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:47,232
Uh, I'll save you
by calling the police.

363
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,443

Got to save Lisa,

380
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,326
D'oh!

381
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,121
Oh!

382
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,082
Oh, no.

383
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,416
That sinister-looking kid

384
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,459
is coming to kill me.

385
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,129
Help! Help! Aah!

Oh, no. Oh, no...

391
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,016
Oh!

398
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,428
It's time to put you away.

399
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,180
-(gasps)
-(gasps)

400
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,432
Put you away for good.

(screaming)

402
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,394
No!

403
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,191
Ho... what the gumdrops
is going on here?

404
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,775
I came to stop you
from murdering Lisa

405
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,277
like you murdered your wife.

406
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,487
Murdered?

407
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,740
Ohhh...

408
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,160
Murdered?
Oh no, I've just been

409
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,328
in the country for a week.

410
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,537
But I distinctly
heard you say

411
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,289
that Maude was with God.

412
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,875
That's right.
I was at Bible camp.

413
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,211
I was learning
how to be more judgmental.

414
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,421
But I saw the murder,
and then I saw you bury the corpse

415
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,881
in the backyard.

416
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,134
All right, it's true.
I am a murderer.

417
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,260
(gasping)

418
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,971
I over-watered Maude's
favorite ficus plant,

419
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,932
I panicked and then
I buried the remains.

420
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,892
-(gasps)
-I was hoping to replace it

421
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,769
-before you got home.
-Oh.

422
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,938
But I heard a woman scream.

423
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,607
Huh? Well, now,
that I can't explain.

424
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,608
Found it, chief.

425
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,777
(high-pitched scream)

426
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,112
Oh. Well, I guess that
explains everything.

427
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,281
Not everything.

428
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,741
There's still
the little matter

429
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,576
of the whereabouts
of your wife.

430
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,994
Um, I'm right here.

431
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,913
Oh, I see.
Then everything is wrapped up

432
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,374
in a neat little package.

433
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,918
Really, I mean that.

434
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,337
Sorry if it sounded sarcastic.

435
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,132
(laughing and clamoring)

436
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,009
More friends! More allies!

437
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,678
More, I say!

438
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,346
Hang those who talk of less!

439
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,807
There's a few inches
over here! Ho!

440
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,273
(screaming)

441
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,857
My precious pool

442
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,403
and its lifestyle
accoutrements. No!

443
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,154
(all grumbling)

444
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,155
Out of here.

445
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,495
Ha-ha.

446
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,497
Oh.

447
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,500
The gentle caress
of a summer breeze.

448
