-Aah!
-(tires screeching)

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,037
Oh, damn F.D.A.
Why can't it all be marshmallow?

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,956
Ew, Bart, don't put
the non-marshmallow pieces

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,333
back in the box,
they go in the trash.

9
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,794
Ooh, you like sweets,
kids?

10
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,380
I know a place that's sweeter
than sweetness itself.

11
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,757
In this sweet place,

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,759
earthly doughnuts
are sour as poison.

13
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,304
You'd spit them out,
you would.

14
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:59,434
I'm talking about
the candy industry trade show.

15
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,852
How did you get tickets?

16
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,979
They hid them in every millionth
Krusty Klump Bar

17
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,689
and Krusty
Klump Bar with almonds.

18
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,863
Hey, Hey, Hey!

19
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,741
I have asked you nicely
not to mangle my merchandise.

20
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,077
You leave me no choice
but to ask you nicely again.

21
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,454
Can I come
to the candy show?

22
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,748
-No! Me! Me!
-Huh? Can I?

23
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,875
Sorry kids, but this
is the one event

24
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,586
I want my darling wife
by my side.

25
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,506
Oh, well, thank you, Homer,
but take one of the kids.

26
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,008
Marge, they can't carry
enough candy.

27
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,968
They have
puny little muscles.

28
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,929
Not big, ropy ones
like you.

29
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,222
(groans)

30
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,058
You go, Mom,
for the greater good.

31
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,434
For the greater good.

32
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:45,063
Homer, are all
these pockets necessary?

33
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,024
They wouldn't be if you were willing
to sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.

34
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,150
(doorbell rings)

35
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,485
That's the baby-sitter.

36
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,779
No one in town will
sit for you two anymore.

37
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,739
I had to choose between
a grad student at the university

38
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,533
and a scary-looking hobo.

39
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,160
Please the hobo,
please the hobo, please the hobo.

40
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,371
Hi. I'm Ashley Grant.

41
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,040
-(Bart groans)
-(gasps) Ashley Grant!

42
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,042
You gave a talk on women's
issues at my school

43
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,586
on how we don't have
to be second-class citizens.

44
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,297
Mom, how can you leave us
with this maniac?

45
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,925
Hurry, Marge! If we get there early,
we can get our pictures taken

46
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,593
with the two surviving
musketeers.

47
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,595
There's also a baby
somewhere upstairs.

48
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,599
-(door slams)
-So, you're one of those

49
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,310
"don't call me a chick"
chicks, huh?

50
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,063
Sorry about
my unenlightened brother.

51
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,899
He will make the next few hours
a living hell.

52
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,109
Oh, I don't know.

53
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,778
See this, Bart?

54
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,738
Disemboweler IV.

55
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,782
The game where condemned
criminals

56
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,909
dig at each other
with rusty hooks.

57
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,828
Mm-hmm...
Do a little housework,

58
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,204
and you can
play for five minutes.

59
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,914
No way.

60
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,001
Yes'm.

61
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,003
See, Lisa?
Males aren't hard to tame.

62
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,881
They all follow their
video cartridges.

63
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,048
Ow.

64
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,434
MAN (on P.A.):
<i>Mr. Goodbar to the front desk.</i>

65
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,312
<i>The front desk is looking</i>
<i>for Mr. Goodbar.</i>

66
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:11,524
(gasps) I feel like a kid
in some kind of a store.

67
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,277
Yeah! Ooh!

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,528
Great.

69
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,281
Exquisite.

70
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,574
Oh, you'll do well.

71
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,618
Give me those.

72
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,913
As you can see, I have created
a lemon ball so sour

73
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,625
it can only be safely contained
in a magnetic field.

74
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,670
The candy,
known as 77-X-42...

75
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,297
Where the hell
is the candy?

76
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,423
(muffled)
I don't know.

77
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,760
Hey, sir, try our wax lips.

78
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,428
It's the candy
of 1,000 uses.

79
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,846
Like what?

80
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,807
One, a humorous substitute
for your own lips.

81
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,685
-Keep going.
-Two, uh...

82
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,104
Ooh, I'm needed in the basement.

83
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,446
Hmm.

84
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,079
You're going to have
to put some sugar

85
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,248
-on that celery or get out, ma'am.
-(Marge groans)

86
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,791
(overlapping chatter)

87
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,046
Ooh, Gummi Bears,
Gummi Calves' Heads,

88
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,631
Gummi Jaw Breakers.

89
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,634

90
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,931
What's that?

91
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,350
That is the rarest
Gummi of them all.

92
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,102
The Gummi Venus de Milo.

93
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,062
Carved by Gummi artisans

94
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:34,232
who work exclusively
in the medium of Gummi.

95
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,067
Will you two stop
saying Gummi so much?

96
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,196
Must have rare Gummi.

97
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,864
Distract the salesman.

98
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,075
No, I won't make a spectacle
out of myself any further.

99
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,913
Oh! Whoa! Oh!

100
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,498
How'd they get there?

101
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,582
(laughs nervously)

102
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,047
Now, this is going to take
all my skill.

103
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,590
(chuckles)

104
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,134
(alarm wailing)

105
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,176
Halt, halt!

106
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,261
Run, Marge!

107
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,429
Save the booty!

108
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,347
After him!
He has the Gummi!

109
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,557
(all shouting)

110
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,822
See you in hell, candy boys!

111
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,956
Ahhhh!

112
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,127
(giggling)

113
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,004
Hey, Lise, I found
a big caramel deposit

114
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,005
at the small of her back.

115
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,173
I'm coming.

116
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,841
(giggling)

117
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,845
(laughing)

118
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:46,888
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

119
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,056
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

120
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,182
Where's my Gummi de Milo?

121
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,683
Okay, don't panic.

122
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,809
She can't have gotten far.

123
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,144
She has no arms.

124
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,562
I'm sure it'll turn up.

125
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,356
Take the baby-sitter home now.

126
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,316
She's been sitting
in the car for 20 minutes.

127
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,318
Relax Marge, there's plenty
for her to do in there.

128
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,320
(horn honking)

129
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,614
See? She's having
the time of her life.

130
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,493
So, a graduate student, huh?

131
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,036
How come you guys
can go to the moon

132
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,662
but you can't make
my shoes smell good?

133
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,998
-I'm sorry.
-Ah, nobody's blaming you.

134
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,708
Hey, would you take
the wheel for a second,

135
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,752
I have to scratch myself
in two places at once.

136
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,587
Just drop me off here.

137
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:22,924
(gasps)

138
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,552
Precious Venus.

139
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,598
-(gasps)
-(groaning)

140
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,933
-(screams)
-(door slams)

141
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,059
Thank you.

142
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,646
(sighs)

143
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,611
(groaning)

144
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,072
Hey, kids, lots of candy
left for breakfast.

145
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,699
(both groaning)

146
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,993
Why don't we give it
to some needy children then?

147
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:51,994
BOTH:
No.

148
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,667
(crowd clamoring)

149
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,002
Oh no, the candy conventioneers
tracked us down.

150
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,966
There he is-- there's the man
that sexually harassed me.

151
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,094
Oh, for a minute there,
I thought I was in big trouble.

152
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,679
It's just a-- D'oh!

153
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,852
(crowd chanting) 2-4-6-8,
Homer's crime was very great.

154
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,187
Great meaning large or immense.

155
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,731
We use it
in the pejorative sense.

156
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,733
Marge, I swear
I didn't touch her.

157
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,277
You know how bashful I am.

158
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,903
I can't even say
the word "titmouse"

159
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,405
without giggling
like a school girl.

160
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,824
(giggling)

161
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,826
At any rate,
I believe you.

162
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,203
And I think you should go outside
and straighten this out.

163
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,831
Some of their chants are
very catchy and memorable.

164
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,668
You grabbed me
in the car!

165
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,838
Oh that... no. I was just
grabbing a Gummi Venus de Milo

166
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,506
that got stuck
to your pants.

167
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,091
Yeah, right.

168
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,926
That's the oldest
excuse in the book.

169
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,303
(booing)

170
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,263
Come on, I'm a decent guy.

171
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,849
(gasping)

172
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:55,808
(booing and hissing)

173
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,481
Why would anybody want
to touch a girl's butt?

174
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,357
That's where
cooties come from.

175
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,776
Dad, I don't understand.
What is she saying you did?

176
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,405
Well Lisa, remember that postcard
Grampa sent us from Florida

177
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,449
of that alligator
biting that woman's bottom?

178

on Homer Simpson

348
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,666
and the bidding starts at 10 Gs!

349
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,501
-I bid 10 Gs!
-10-5 Gs!

350
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,294
-Fifteen!
-Fifteen-five!

351
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,295
Oh...

352
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,047
I need a hug.

353
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,048
(murmuring)

354
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,804
How come
you guys hesitated?

355
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,556
Sorry, Dad. We do believe
in you. We really do.

356
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,433
It's just hard not
to listen to TV.

357
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,643
It's spent so
much more time

358
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,894
raising us
than you have.

359
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,064
Oh... maybe TV is right.

360
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,857
TV's always right.

361
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,659
HOMER:
Are you hugging the TV?

362
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,661
-BOTH: No.
-(kisses TV loudly)

363
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:42,501
<i>(audience cheering)</i>

364
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:46,046
<i>And the number one reference</i>
<i>that I am running into the ground</i>

365
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,341
<i>is Homer Simpson!</i>

366
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,968
<i>(audience cheering)</i>

367
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,850
<i>Ay-yi-yi!</i>
<i>Es Homer Simpson!</i>

368
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,811
Me ha molestado! <i>Oh!</i>

369
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,565
Ohh. I like it better
when they're making fun

370
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,567
of people who aren't me.

371
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,777
I know!
Evening at the Improv.

372
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,405
They never talk about anything
beyond the 1980s.

373
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,157
<i>See, I think about weird stuff.</i>

374
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,744
<i>Like, what would happen</i>
<i>if E.T. and Mr. T. had a baby.</i>

375
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,246
<i>Well, you'd get</i>
<i>Mr. E.T., wouldn't you?</i>

376
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,499
<i>And you know, I think he'd</i>
<i>sound a little something like this.</i>

377
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,126

<i>I pity the fool who doesn't</i>

378
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,004
<i>phone home.</i>

379
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,340
(chuckles) Ooh, I wouldn't
want to be Mr. T. right now.

380
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,593
Homer, the kids
have a great idea

381
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,927
how you can clear
your name!

382
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,055
The media is making
a monster out of you

383
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,431
because they don't care
about the truth.

384
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,224
All they care about
is entertainment.

385
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,060
Well, you need a forum
where they don't even know

386
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,936
the meaning of the word
entertainment.

387
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,855
Public Access television.

388
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,690
Aw, but those shows
all look so crummy.

389
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,609
Well, we can
dress it up a bit.

390
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,737
We can bring a fern,
and a folding chair from the garage

391
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,990
and the most decorative thing
of all-- the truth.

392
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,793
There are only 49 stars
on that flag.

393
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,045
I'll be deep in the cold,
cold ground

394
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,963
before I recognize Missouri.

395
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:17,346
Now it's time for the
Innocence Report, with Homer Simpson.

396
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,391
Hello. I am Homer Simpson,

397
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:25,020
or as some of you wags
have dubbed me, "Father Goose."

398
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:29,274
You know, everybody believed
the worst about me right away.

399
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,610
Nobody cares that
I didn't do it.

400
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,403
But I didn't.

401
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,864
Okay, look, I've done
some bad things in my life,

402
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,076
but harassing women
is not one of them.

403
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,995
Like one time
we were having this race

404
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,915
with this stupid old-timey
bicycle with the big wheel in front.

405
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,501
So I figure,
"We'll see about that."

406
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,838
so I get this big chunk
of cinder block, and I--

407
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,549
-(groaning)
-Oh, got to go.

408
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,008
Innocent.

409
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,008
Innocent.

410
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,095
Dad, you did it.
I am so proud of you.

411
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,680
The switchboards
are lighting up!

412
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,014
ALL:
Yay!

413
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,307
Two calls.

414
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,226
That's our best ever!

415
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,145
Hello? No, Janice
doesn't live here.

416
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,521
Hello?

417
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,982
Yes, I am interested
in long-distance savings.

418
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,942
Very interested.

419
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,777
(all groaning)

420
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,781
Marge, this is
so depressing.

421
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,243
My only hope is this
homemade Prozac.

422
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,954
Mmm... needs
more ice cream.

423
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,038
(doorbell rings)

424
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,252
So, uh, you don't like
the old-time bikes, huh?

425
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,670
(groans)

426
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,300
(doorbell rings)

427
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,886
Homer, I love amateur video.

428
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,681
And your show is the most
amateur video I ever saw.

429
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:46,476
My hobby is secretly
videotaping couples and gals.

430
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,646
I dare not come forward,
because in this country

431
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,274
it makes you look
like a pervert!

432
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,903
But every single Scottish person
does it!

433
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,906
Oh, baby.

434
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,616
Oh, yeah. Oh, baby.

435
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,576
Oh, no. That's Mayor Quimby.

436
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,204
Ah. Here we go.

437
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,789

444

Dad, this clears
you completely!

445
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,761
You know the courts
might not work anymore,

446
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:24,014
but as long as everybody
is videotaping everyone else,

447
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,682
justice will be done.

448
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,228
See?

449
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,730
Hmm. Homer,
I thought you were an animal,

450
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,732
but your daughter said
you were a decent man.

451
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,359
I guess she was right.

452
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,569
You're both right.
