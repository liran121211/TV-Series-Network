00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:15,932
D'oh!

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,434
-Ahh!
-(tires screech)

5
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:36,453
(sniffling)

6
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:40,248
This romance is so full
of heartfelt passion.

7
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:44,335
I can really identify
with this corn-fed heroine.

8
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,630
Homer, are you awake?
This is important.

9
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,882
Give me some sign
you're awake.

10
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,842
-(belches)
-Wake up!

11
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,635
Huh? What's wrong?

12
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,138
House run away?
Dog's on fire?

13
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,890
Homie, do you think that
the romance

14
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,391
has gone out of our lives?

15
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,559
(belches)

16
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,394
Wake up!

17
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,272
Marge, it's 3:00 a.m.,
and I worked all day.

18
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,025
It's 9:30 p.m., and you spent
your whole Saturday

19
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,360
drinking beer
in Maggie's kiddie pool.

20
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,530
Hmm? There you are.

21
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,199
Thought you could get away, huh?

22
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,202
Homer, young people
learn about love from adults,

23
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,953
and we've been setting
a terrible example

24
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,872
for our children and
the community in general.

25
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,791
I want us to
deal with the issues

26
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,542
raised by this book.

27
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,668
Hmm.

28
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,632
I knew we shouldn't have put
a fireplace in the bedroom.

29
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,738
<i>Huh?</i>

30
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,617
<i>(screaming)</i>

31
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,665
(laughing)

32
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,084
How many times
can you laugh at that cat

33
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,710
getting hit
by the moon?

34
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,337
It's a new episode.

35
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,881
Not exactly. They pieced
it together from old shows

36
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,758
and it seems new
to the trusting eyes

37
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,135
of impressionable youth.

38
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,469
Really?

39
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,429
Ren and Stimpy 
do it all the time.

40
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,390
Yes, they do, and when was
the last time you heard anyone

41
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,725
talk about Ren and Stimpy?

42
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,146
Children, your father and I
have fed you and clothed you,

43
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,731
but we've neglected
something more important.

44
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,109
It's time to learn
about love.

45
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,111
No need, Mom. We already
learned in school.

00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,280
NARRATOR:
<i>This is Fuzzy Bunny.</i>

47
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,948
<i>About a year ago,</i>

48
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,992
<i>he noticed his voice</i>
<i>was changing.</i>

49
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,785
<i>He had terrible acne</i>

50
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,038
<i>and had fur where</i>
<i>there was no fur before.</i>

51
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,541
<i>He also noticed</i>
<i>Fluffy Bunny.</i>

52
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,543
Bor-ring.

53
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,086
<i>Fuzzy went to the park,</i>

54
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,714
<i>the ice cream social,</i>
<i>the boat show,</i>

55
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,133
<i>and various other</i>
<i>wholesome activities.</i>

56
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,135
<i>And they never</i>
<i>ruined their fun</i>

57
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,430
<i>by giving in to their</i>
<i>throbbing biological urges.</i>

58
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,932
<i>Then came the big day.</i>

59
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,851
<i>Fluffy and Fuzzy</i>
<i>got married.</i>

60
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:08,104
<i>That night came</i>
<i>the honeymoon.</i>

61
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,731
ALL: Eww!

62
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,316
She's faking it.

63
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,736
I mean romance,
not love.

64
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,112
Mom, romance is dead.

65
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,531
It was acquired
in a hostile takeover

66
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,949
by Hallmark and Disney,

67
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,327
homogenized and sold off
piece by piece.

68
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,661
That's not true.

69
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,538
Romance is all around us--

70
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,332
in our neighborhoods...

71
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,500
<i>even at our jobs.</i>

72
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,926
(moaning)

73
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,512
All you have to do

74
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,515
is think about
your most cherished memories.

75
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,100
Hmm.

76
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,602
<i>-Moe's Tavern.</i>
-Hello, is Al there?

77
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,354
<i>Al?</i>

78
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,980
Yeah, Al.
Last name Coholic.

79
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,941
Let me check.

80
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,360
Phone call for Al.
Al Coholic.

81
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,612
A Jock Strap?

82
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,656
Is I.P. Freely here?

83
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,574
Hey, is there a Butts here?

84
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,451
Seymour Butts?

85
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,828
Ah, Homer Sexual?

86
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,623
Mike Crotch?
Uh, Amanda Hugginkiss?

87
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,084
Ah, Hugh Jass?
Ivana Tinkle?

88
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,711
I'm a stupid moron
with an ugly face

89
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,339
and a big butt,
and my butt smells,

90
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,549
and I like to kiss
my own butt.

91
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,426
No! No! No!

92
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,514
No, ask your heart
what its fondest desire is.

93
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,556
Hmm.

94
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,933
Mmm...

95
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,352
chocolate.

96
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,355
Mmm.
Invisible cola.

97
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,483
Mmm.
Forbidden doughnut.

98
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,110
Mmm.

99
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,611
Sacrilicious.

100
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,281
Mmm. Snouts.

101
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,283
Mmm. Free goo.

102
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,952
Mmm. Something.

103
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,538
No. Think about people--

104
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,250
about moments in your life
that have been very romantic.

105
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,960
Oh, okay.

106
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,587
(crowd cheering)

107
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,841
That's not the idea at all.

108
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,801
Hmm.

109
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,762
Okay. Well,
this story isn't ideal.

110
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,181
I've never told it
to you before.

111
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,934
<i>I got a very thoughtless</i>
<i>birthday present</i>

112
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,854
<i>from someone</i>
<i>who shall remain nameless.</i>

113
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,815
(groans)

114
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,984
<i>So I actually went</i>
<i>to the bowling alley</i>

115
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,152
<i>to spite him-- or her.</i>

116
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,486
Hmm.

117
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,827
Oh.

118
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,164
I'm awfully sorry.

119
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,583
(French accent)
Entirely my fault.

120
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,418
It is nice
to meet you...

121
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,088
-Homer.
-Oh. No, no.

122
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,090
Homer is my...
ball's name.

123
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,092
I'm Marge.

124
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,594
(chuckling)

125
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,433
Your fingers are so slender,
so feminine.

126
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,561
They're far too tapered
for the ball you're using.

127
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,606
You need something lighter,
more delicate.

128
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,982
Here, use my ball.

129
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,776
No. No, thank you,

130
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,694
mister, um... Brunswick.

131
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,112
Call me Jacques.

132
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,155
Jacques.

133
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,740
Marge.

134
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,991
Hmm.

135
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,951
May I ask you
a bold question?

136
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:09,994
Sure.

137
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,412
You've never
bowled before?

138
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,455
-Never.
-No.

139
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,916
-No.
-Then I will teach you.

140
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,376
Oh, I don't want
to trouble you.

141
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,294
Not at all.
I am a professional.

142
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,255
Roll the ball for me, Marge.
Let me see your form.

143
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,092
All right,
but I'm not very good.

144
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,638
I can hit that
one pin all right,

145
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,932
but the rest of them
don't even wobble.

146
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,683
I can help you, Marge.
Pick up the ball.

147
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,936
Pick up Homer.
Pick him up.

148
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,188
(squeals)

149
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,482
-Now, throw.
-But--

150
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,025
Throw, damn you.

151
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:48,157
You're a very
good teacher.

152
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,284
(humming)
Here we are.

153
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,245
You didn't have to
drop me off.

154
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,663
But I wanted to.

155
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,499
Marge, do you know
how beautiful you look

156
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,126
in the moonlight?

157
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,461
Oh, Jacques,
I'm a married woman.

158
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,088
I know, I know.

159
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,424
My mind says stop,
but my heart

160
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,676
and my hips
cry, "proceed!"

161
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,136
(groaning)

162
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,471
Marge, darling, I want
to see you tomorrow.

163
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,014
Meet me tomorrow
for brunch.

164
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,016
-What's brunch?
-You'd love it.

165
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,269
It's not quite breakfast.
It's not quite lunch.

166
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,896
But it comes with a slice
of cantaloupe at the end.

167
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,774
You don't get completely
what you would at breakfast,

168
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,401
but you get
a good meal.

169
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,736
MARGE: <i>He seemed to know</i>
<i>a lot about brunch.</i>

170
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,406
<i>But it turned out he wasn't</i>
<i>interested in brunch at all.</i>

171
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,699
(laughing)

172
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,868
Your laughter
is like music to me.

173
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,370
But if you laugh at what I
say next, I will die.

174
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,206
For I am about to say
something very serious,

175
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,374
perhaps shocking.

176
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,709
Marge, my darling,

177
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,295
I want you
to meet with me again.

178
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,880
That doesn't shock me.

179
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,258
Away from prying eyes
at my apartment,

180
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,093
the Fiesta Terrace.

181
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,845
(gasping)

182
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,764
Marge, speak to me.

183
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,225
Is Thursday okay?

184
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,894
(tires screeching)

185
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,729
(groaning)

186
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,490
<i>Thank goodness</i>

187
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,909
<i>I drove down that</i>
<i>ironic street.</i>

188
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,287
I made the right decision
to stay with my Homie

189
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,414
and there was no harm done.

190
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,916
(moans)

191
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,460
So if you kind of
mentally snip out the part

192
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,128
where I already had a husband,

193
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,922
that's my idea of romance.

194
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,466
Marge, I want you
to stop seeing this Jacques.

195
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,885
You can let him down gently.

196
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,053
But over the next
couple of months,

197
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,888
I want you to break it off.

198
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,390
Uh, okay, Homer.

199
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,226
That was
a close one, kids.

200
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,647
Okay, Marge,

201
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,982
as long as we're
traumatizing the kids,

202
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,319
I have a scandalous story
of my own.

203
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,154
SMITHERS:
Gentlemen,

204
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,990
I'd like you to meet your
new co-worker, Mindy Simmons.

205
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,326
I think she has a degree
in engineering or something.

206
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,994
Hi. How's it going?

207
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,080
-Pleased to meet you.
-Yeah. Ditto.

208
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,164
Hi. Huh?

209
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,291
(gasps)

210
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,462
Homer, what's
the matter?

211
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,130
Ain't you never seen
a naked chick

212
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,298
riding a clam before?

213
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,926
Got to go!

214
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,346

(sighs)

216
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,892
I made it the whole day
without seeing her again.

217
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,980
(screams)
I mean, hello!

218
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,316
I guess we'll be
going down together--

219
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,484
I mean, getting off togeth--
I mean--

220
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,111
That's okay.

221
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,654
I'll just push the button
for the stimulator--

222
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,823
I mean elevator.

I got a really wicked idea

248
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,916
that could get us
into a lot of trouble.

249
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,836
Mindy. We have to fight
our temptation.

250
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,963
No, Homer.

251
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,590
Let's do it.

252
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,635

Well... we don't have to.

Yes, we do.

00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,241
Well, desserts

290
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,488
Yes, what did happen to her?

291
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,907

and lost her job.

Hmm. Good.

293
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,870
Does anyone else
have a love story?

294
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,080
Yes, I do. And just like
your love stories,

295
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,125
it's tragic and filled with
hurt feelings and scars

296
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,085

-Ralph.

your girlfriend, Ralph?

347
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,179
Yes. I love Lisa Simpson,

348
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,307

I'm going to marry her.

349

I don't like you!
I never liked you!

352
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,565
And the only reason I gave you
that stupid Valentine

turn out that way.

Bart, do you have
a love story

361
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,420
that doesn't end
