00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:06,548
CHORUS: <i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:11,177
(bell ringing)

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,264
(whistle blowing)

00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,186

00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,908
(tires screeching)

00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,620
D'oh!
(screams)

10
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,080
(tires screeching)

11
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,377
(stone sizzles)

12
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,890
(chuckles) This sting
can't miss, boys.

13
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,850
I mailed these
bogus prize certificates

14
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,436
to every scofflaw
in Springfield.

15
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,439
When they show up
for their free motorboats,

16
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,690
we arrest them and beat them

17
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,901
to the full extent of the law.

18
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:11,279
(chuckles)
So the hook is baited.

19
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,281
(chuckles)
Nice metaphor, Eddie.

20
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,699
Yeah, good work, Eddie.

21
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,036

24
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,001
But we didn't enter
any police raffle.

25
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,171
That doesn't matter.
The important thing is we won.

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,007
(tires screeching)

27
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,175
I don't know.

28
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,928
There's something
very peculiar about this.

29
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,262
Sheesh!

30
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,099
You're the most paranoid family
I've ever been affiliated with.

31
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,768
(whistling)

32
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,729
I'd like a yellow boat,
please, with extra motors.

33
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,023
Yo, no cuts, bro.

34
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,775
Where's my motorboat, pig?

35
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,568
Uh, right through that door.

36
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,695
(titters)

37
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,365
(cuffs clicking)

38
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,283
Whoa! Yo! Ouch!

39
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,368
(Snake groans)

40
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,120
I call brutality on you.

41
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,371
You have the right to remain-

42
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,664
(chuckles)

43
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,958
All right, uh,
"Simpson, Homer."

44
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,793
-You're next.
-Whoo-hoo!

45
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,964
Howdy, gents.
I'm here to collect my free-

46
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,633
Ow! Oh, my boating arm!

47
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,968
What's going on?

48
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,803
You're under arrest, slimebag.

49
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,388
What's this perp in for, Lou?

50
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,182
Two hundred and thirty-five
unpaid parking tickets

51
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,309
totaling $175.

52
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,854
(snickers) I hope you brought
your checkbook, wise guy.

53
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,356
You lousy cops.

54
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,358
Lucky for you
I'm double-parked or I'd--

55
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:34,696
There. Now, could I
please have my motorboat?

56
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,451
Dad, why aren't you
saying anything?

57
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,953
Where's our motorboat?

58
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,997
I didn't like it.
The mast had termites.

59
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,707
Why would a motorboat
have a mast?

60
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,000
Because!

61
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,127
The thing, it was... shut up!

62
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,920
(tires screeching)

63
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,465
Whoo! There's that new
mega-mall they're building.

64
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,551
They say
the air conditioner will be

65
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,512
more powerful
than a million hydrogen bombs.

66
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,015
Hey, they can't just
build a parking lot

67
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,224
on Sabertooth Meadow!

68
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,476
That's where they discovered
all those fossils.

69
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,353
Fossils, schmossils.

70
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,648
You can't stop progress
'cause of some moldy old bones.

71
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,442
Bones, schmones.

72
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,028
But they might be paving
over rare specimens.

73
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,113
Pull over
so we can complain, Dad.

74
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,490
Come on!
Who wants to complain with me?

75
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,577
Fine. I'll come back later.

76
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,662
Who wants to come back with me?

77
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,123
(mutters) Fine.

78
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,046
My attorney, Lionel Hutz,
calls your attention

79
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,423
to municipal code 147-C-

80
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,467
"protection of
antiquities and fossils."

81
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,968
That's right.

82
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,057
There aren't any fossils here,
little girl.

83
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,643
Museum folks
dug 'em all up years ago.

84
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,228
But what if they
missed something?

85
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,772
You have to allow
an archaeological survey.

86
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,565
Who's gonna make us? You?

87
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,735
(laughing)

88
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,862
Now, hold on, Sid. Hold on.

89
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,405
May be we should
let the kid dig.

90
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,865
Could be good publicity.

91
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,368
(indistinct whispering)

92
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,286
Oh, yes.
I'd rather do that.

93
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,706
OK. You wanna dig? Be my guest.

94
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,959
Fine! We'll see you in court!

95
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,670
-Mr. Hutz, we won.
-"We"?

96
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,132
Principal Skinner,
remember how I didn't sue

97
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,593
when I found that scorpion
in my applesauce?

98
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,470
Well, I'm calling in a favor.

99
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:25,431
Mm, I knew
this day would come.

I must admit,
it is rather exciting. And--

113
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,469
Look!
Here's something right here.

114
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,431
It appears to be
some sort of rock.

115
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,142
Oh, no, no.
It's just a clump of dirt.

116
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,687

is pounding like a kettle drum.

117

-RALPH: It's a spearhead!

122
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,409
That's your
trowel blade, Ralph.

123
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,744
It fell off the handle.

124
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,162
And I found it!

125
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,247
OK, everyone, back to work!

126
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,667

Well, this was a big bust.

133
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,019
Come on, kids.
Let's go home to our mothers.

134
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,189
Don't give up.
I'm sure we'll find something.

135
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,525

136
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,570

CLANCY WIGGUM:
Hey, what is that?

141
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,584
Hope it's not-

142
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,211
Let me through.
I got here late.

143
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,588
(crowd chattering)

144
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,177
Hmm, from the looks of it,

145
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,347
I'd say this fellow died
from causes unknown.

146
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,099
(laughs)

147
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,519
Look, there's more!
What the heck is this thing?

148
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:38,314
Speaking from a strictly medical
point of view, that ain't right.

149
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,779
(gasps) Oh, my goodness!

150
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,698
What is it, Lisa?

151
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,909
It looks like a human skeleton.

152
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,703
But these other bones
look almost like wings.

153
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,872
You mean, like... an angel?

154
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,291
Well, obviously,
that's impossible.

155
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,918
Lisa's right. It's an angel!

156
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,795
(gasps)

157
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,257
HOMER: Now, that's
interesting.

158
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,553
(chattering continues)

159
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,221
But it can't be an angel!

160
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,514
Oh, no?

161
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,974
Well, if you're so sure
what it ain't,

162
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,684
how about telling us
what it am?

163
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,811
(onlookers clamoring)

164
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,397
Well, maybe it's, uh...

165
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,401
uh, a neanderthal who got bitten
by some angry fish.

166
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,820
(whiny grunt)

167
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,905
(muttering, cries out)

168
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,491
(screaming)

169
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,165
(chuckles)
Oh, I got to say, Lisa.

170
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,834
It sounds like you're straining
to do some explaining.

171
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,711
Yeah, everyone's heard
of angels, but...

172
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,797
Who's ever heard of
a "neanderthal"?

173
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,090
(chuckles)

174
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,633
It could be anything.

175
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,011
It could be a mutant
from the nuclear plant.

176
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,053
Oh, fiddle-faddle.

177
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,055
Everyone knows
our mutants have flippers.

178
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,683
Ooh, oops. I've said too much.
(clears throat)

179
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,268
Smithers, use the amnesia ray.

180
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,395
-You mean, the revolver, sir?
-Precisely.

181
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,647
Be sure to wipe your own memory
clear when you're finished.

182
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,858
Now, regardless
of what this thing is,

183
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,194
it's a priceless
scientific find.

184
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,613
So our most
pressing concern now

185
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,073
is determining who owns
such a valuable skeleton.

186
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,867
And I'd like to suggest
that I do.

187
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,162
(onlookers protesting)

188
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,663
WOMAN: Excuse me.

189
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,874
I'd like to hear
from Lionel Hutz.

190
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,001
It's a thorny legal issue,
all right.

191
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,463
I'll need to refer to the case
of finders versus keepers.

192
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,715
Oh, we can work this out,
friends.

193
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,551
In the spirit of sharing,
what say we simply place

194
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,179
-the sacred bones--
-(horn honking)

195
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,555
So long, suckers!

196
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,892
(grunting)

197
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,603
Come on. Come on, angel.

198
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,897
-(grunts)
-What are you doing with that?

199
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,441
I'm locking it up
in my safe-deposit closet

200
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,901
with my other valuables.

201
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,779
I'll just leave it
in here a few years

202
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,406
and let it appreciate in value.

203
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,200
It's probably
a million years old, Dad.

204
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,826
I think it's as valuable
as it's gonna get.

205
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,869
(scoffs)

206
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,331
That's what they said about
this billy beer, smarty-pants.

207
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,921
(sighs)
We elected the wrong Carter.

208
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,047
<i>KENT </i>(on TV):

209
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,758

211
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,931

Sounds like good watching.

212
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,391
(doorbell rings)

213
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,979
He-hey there, Marge.
Just brought the kids over

214
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,605
to share a prayer with
the blessed angel,

215
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,815
if it's okay with you.

216
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,942
HOMER (shouting): Get your own
angel, you moocher!

217
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,611
(sighs) Thanks anyway, Homer.

218
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,905
(doorbell rings)

219
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,284
Oh, hello, Agnes.

220
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,618
Sorry to trouble you,

221
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,620
but I'm going in
for surgery tomorrow

222
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,038
and I wondered if I could

223
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,374
rub the angel with my foot
for good luck.

224
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,542
It's foot surgery.

225
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,794
HOMER:
Hey, I'm trying to eat here!

226
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,170
Beat it, peg leg!

227
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,714
Jackass!

228
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,048
Marge.

229
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,388
We wanna see the angel.

230
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,764
(crowd clamoring)

231
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,975
Come on, Homer.
I just want a quick look-see.

232
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,561
-Pay you a buck.
-A buck, eh?

233
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,646
That gives me an idea.

234
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,065
-Fifty cents, please.
-(coins clattering)

235
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,734
(Homer's voice)
<i>♪ Here's the angel ♪</i>

236
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,570
<i>♪ See the angel</i>
<i>it's my angel ♪</i>

237
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,990
<i>♪ No one else's</i>
<i>next to the rags ♪</i>

238
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,743
Dad, it's not fair to claim
this thing is an angel.

239
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,119
There's no proof of that.

240
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,455
No one's
calling it an angel, Lisa.

241
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,165
If you look carefully,

242
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,126
you'll notice I never
once used the word "angel."

243
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,502
What about
that sign right there?

244
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,962
That's a typo.

245
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,340
Just let me take it
to the museum for one day.

246
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:36,177
They can do scientific tests
and prove it's not an angel.

247
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,430
Oh, no. Oh, no. We could lose
out on bags and bags of money.

248
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,098
It's sacrilegious, I tell ya.

249
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,979
(door creaking)

250
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,456
Wow, it's so lifelike.

251
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,837
(moaning)

252
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:12,963
(gulps)

253
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,717
DR. GOULD: Astonishing.
Simply astonishing.

254
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,387
One of the most singular
specimens I've encountered

255
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,639
in all my distinguished career.

256
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,307
But enough about my work.

257
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,850
What did you
want to show me, Lisa?

258
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,895
It's a bone scraping
from that skeleton I found.

259
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,523
Oh, yeah. The so-called angel.

260
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,733
The whole thing's
preposterous, of course.

261
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,193
Quite preposterous.

262
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,530
But no one will believe me
until I can prove what it really is.

263
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,323
Can't you do a DNA test
or something?

264
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,076
Certainly. I'll have
the results by tomorrow.

265
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,703
Oh, thank you so much.

266
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,081
Um, you know,
I can't afford to pay you.

267
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,084
I didn't become a scientist
for financial gain.

268
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,753
Whatever little money
you have will be just fine.

269
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,675
I say it's the angel of peace,
you idiot.

270
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,010
I say it's the angel of mercy,
you jerk.

271
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,053
LISA: Excuse me.

272
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,515
I took a piece of the skeleton
for scientific analysis.

273
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,392
Soon we'll have all the facts.

274
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,518
You did what?

275
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,270
You know what?
I don't like that.

276
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,355
(scoffs)
Facts are meaningless.

277
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,982
You can use
facts to prove anything

278
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,109
that's even remotely true.

279
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,652
Facts, schmacts.

280
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,779
-(panting)
-Ah, here's Dr. Gould now.

281
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,282
What were the results,
professor?

282
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,533
Inconclusive.

283
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,326
"Inconclusive"?

284
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,662
Then why'd you come
running up like that?

285
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,331
Can I use your bathroom?

286
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,916
(groans)

287
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,962
Well, it appears science
has faltered once again

288
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,632
in the face of overwhelming
religious evidence.

289
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,593
-But--
-Go home, science girl.

290
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,719
I am home.

291
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,762
Good. Stay there.

292
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,307
OK, folks.
Get your "angel glow sticks."

293
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,684
No one gets into heaven
without a glow stick.

294
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,769
I'll take four.

295
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,064
Agh! Those morons
make me so angry.

296
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,777
Maybe so, but I'd appreciate it
if you didn't call them morons.

297
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,403
But they are morons.

298
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,530
What grown person
could believe in angels?

299
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,531
Well...

300
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,617
Your mother, for one.

301
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,160
You?

302
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,289
But, y-you're
an intelligent person, Mom.

303
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:14,251
There has to be more to life
than just what we see, Lisa.

304
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,545
Everyone needs
something to believe in.

305
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,298
It's not that I don't have
a spiritual side.

306
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,800
I just find it hard to believe

307
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,511
there's a dead angel
hanging in our garage.

308
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,555
Hmm. My poor Lisa.

309
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,183
If you can't make a leap
of faith now and then,

310
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,102
well, I feel sorry for you.

311
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,688
Don't feel sorry for me, Mom.

312
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,982
I feel sorry for you.

328
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,852
Science? What's science
ever done for us?

329
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,144
TV off.

330
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,980
Science is like a blabbermouth

331
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,482
who ruins a movie
by telling you how it ends.

332
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,859
Well, I say
there are some things

333
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,194
we don't wanna know,
important things.

334
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,321
Yeah, he's right!

335
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,447
Enough talk.

336
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,324
It's smashing time!

337
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,493
(indistinct screams)

338
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:35,708
(mob yelling)

339
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,671
Take that and that and--

340
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,506
(groans) I'm paralyzed.

341
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,050
I just hope medical science
can cure me.

342
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,345
(screaming continues)

343
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,933
Why? Why was I programmed
to feel pain?

344
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,728
Technocrats are learning
a lesson in humility tonight

345
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,479
as angel supporters lay waste

346
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,108
to Springfield's
scientific institutions.

347
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,528
Ugh! I wish I'd never found
those stupid bones!

348
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,071
It's time to put
an end to this.

349
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,073
Bart, I'm borrowing
your blue crowbar.

350
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,575
Good ol' blue-y.

351
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,744
Hey, she's gonna
smash the angel!

352
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,454
Somebody stop her!

353
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,583
(gasps)

354
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,543
It's gone!

355
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,253
(weeping) Oh, no!

356
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,880
This can't be happening!

357
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:27,176
What the hell are we gonna do
with 10,000 angel ashtrays?

358
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,261
-I could take up smoking.
-You damn well better.

359
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,311
Okay. Okay, don't panic.
Marge, stop panicking!

360
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,563
We need a replacement skeleton,
and we need it now.

361
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,315
Bart, strip down
to your skeleton.

362
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,524
(door opening)

363
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,778
We've come
for the angel, Homer.

364
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,446
It's not safe
with the unbeliever.

365
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,531
It's gone! We're too late.

366
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,618
Little girl, what have you done
with our precious angel?

367
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,995
Nothing!
Someone must have stolen it.

368
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,747
Looks to me like Lisa Simpson

369
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,042
found something
science couldn't explain,

370
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,336
so she had to destroy it.

371
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,339
Well, that's all the evidence
I need. Arrest the girl.

372
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,634
-(gasps) Hey!
-What? She didn't do anything.

373
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,886
Give her a nice cell--
something in "C" block.

374
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,641
Lisa Simpson, you are charged

375
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:19,353
with destruction of an historic curiosity,
a misdemeanor.

376
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,646
But in a larger sense,

377
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,357
this trial will settle
the age-old question

378
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,442
of science versus religion.

379
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,528
Let the opening
statements commence.

380
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:31,240
Your Honor, over the coming
weeks and months,

381
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,368
we intend to prove Lisa Simpson
willfully destroyed--

382
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,536
There's the angel!

383
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,746
(murmuring)

384
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:43,127
(shouting, chattering)

385
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,256
I find the defendant
not guilty.

386
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,299
As for science versus religion,

387
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,010
I'm issuing a restraining order.

388
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:54,805
Religion must stay 500 yards
from science at all times.

389
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,683
(chattering continues)

390
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,354
Wow!
Do you think it flew up here?

391
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,606
Well, it didn't
ride up on no zebra.

392
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,066
Look, a message!

393
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,319
"The end will
come at sundown."

394
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,363
(laughing) Hey...

395
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,241
Wait a second.
I don't like the sound of that.

396
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm scared, Daddy.

397
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,245
Too scared
to even wet my pants.

398
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,081
It's OK, son.
Just relax, and it'll come.

399
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,417
Even Lisa Simpson
must now agree.

400
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,419
We have witnessed a miracle.

401
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,963
Hardly.
Anyone could've written that.

402
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,467
Oh, angel, listen not
to this child of Satan.

403
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,885
Reverend, I've got to admit.

404
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,096
This doomsday warning
has me just a smidge twitterpated.

405
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,432
Oh, now, be calm, Ned.

406
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,977
But be afraid also,
tremendously afraid

407
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,480
for the day
of reckoning is upon us!

408
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,481
(gasping, murmuring)

409
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,607
Reckoning?

410
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,450
Your Holiness,
there is word from America.

411
00:17:56,533 --> 00:18:00,120
They say an angel
has foretold the apocalypse.

412
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,914
Um, keep an eye on it.

413
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,583
MRS. KRABAPPEL: This could be
our last day together, my love.

414
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,837
How about a farewell romp
in the garden of earthly delights?

415
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,799
Oh, Edna, my sweet buttercup,
you read my mind.

416
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,801
Just, uh, give me 20 minutes

417
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,469
or so to finish
these tardy slips.

418
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,263
Why we getting dressed-up, Mom?

419
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,515
Are we going to Black Angus?

420
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,392
Well, you might say we're going

421
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,062
to the best steakhouse
in the whole universe.

422
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,356
So we're not going
to Black Angus.

423
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,526
Will you leave me alone?

424
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,152
It's bad enough
you're making me

425
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,029
go to your stupid judgment day.

426
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,489
Please, Lisa.

427
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,492
I don't know
exactly what's gonna happen.

428
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:42,162
But I really wish we could
make peace before sunset.

429
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,540
Nothing is going
to happen, Mom!

430
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,916
I hate to disappoint you,

431
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,460
but the world
is not coming to an end.

432
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,094
Well, shall we sing a hymn?

433
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,513
Uh, "Nearer,
My God, to Thee" maybe?

434
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,682
Or-or-or-or "Amazing Grace"?

435
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,183
Mm. Nah.

436
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:07,146
Oh, Marge.
Don't let go, no matter what.

437
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,231
If they want you in heaven,
they got to take me, too.

438
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,818
Ten seconds till sundown.

439
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,361
(indistinct chatter)

440
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,363
(taking deep drag)

441
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,032
(huffing exhale)

442
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,578
We did it. We beat cancer.

443
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,330
Oh, what the hell?

444
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,665
Mwah!

445
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,458
Seven, six...

446
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,086
Five, four,

447
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,423
three, two, one.

448
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,091
(all gasping)

449
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,760
(crickets chirping)

450
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,597
(all sigh)

451
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,975
(all muttering)

452
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,020
Well, there you go.
I hope you all learned a val--

453
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,104
MALE VOICE: Silence!

454
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,025
(all gasp)

455
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,696
(all gasping)

456
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,575
Prepare for the end!

457
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,659
(whimpering)

458
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,787
The end of high prices!

459
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,955
What?

460
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,248
Ooh.

461
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,250
Behold!

462
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,921
The grand opening
of the Heavenly Hills Mall.

463
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:19,760
Please just follow the angel
for all your shopping needs!

464
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,929
(mechanized whirring)

465
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,311
Wait a second!

466
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,064
You planted a phony skeleton
for me to find!

467
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,732
This was all a big hoax!

468
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,858
(chuckles)

469
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,110
Not a hoax, a publicity stunt.

470
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,155
You exploited
people's deepest beliefs

471
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,616
just to hawk your cheesy wares?

472
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,118
Well, we are outraged!

473
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,119
Aren't we?

474
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,121
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we're outraged.

475
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,415
Very, uh, very much so.

476
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,669
But look at all the stores!
A-a pottery barn!

477
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,796
And 20% off everything?

478
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,506
Hey, does that
include rat spray?

479
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,507
Oh, yeah.

480
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,384
-Out of my way, shorty!
-Hey!

481
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,262
(all clamoring)

482
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,933
I don't understand, professor.

483
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,894
Why didn't your tests
show the skeleton was a fake?

484
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,980
I'm gonna be honest
with you, Lisa.

485
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,107
I never did the tests.

486
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,650
(electrical current sizzling)

487
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,360
(excited chattering)

488
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,779
Uh, sir, about that, uh...

489
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,948
that kiss-l-I hope

490
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:26,326
you understand it was merely
a sign of my respect.

491
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,328
Yes. Yes, of course.

492
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,293
Well, I guess
you were right, honey.

493
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,961
But you have to admit,

494
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,963
when that angel started to talk

495
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,424
you were squeezing
my hand pretty hard.

496
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:45,137
(embarrassed chuckle) Well, it was just
so loud and... (laughs)

497
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,764
Thanks for squeezing back.

498
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,933
Anytime, my angel.

499
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,944
(theme music playing)

500
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,233
Shh.
