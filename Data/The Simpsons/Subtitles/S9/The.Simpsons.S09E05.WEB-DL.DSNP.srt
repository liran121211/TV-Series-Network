(women gasping, giggling)

18
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:17,160
Hey, Dad, how come you've never
taken us to see a soccer game?

19
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,037
I don't know.

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,581

-Whoo-hoo!

Please, Dad? please, Dad? Can we go?

-Huh? Huh? Please?
-Yes! Yes! Oh, God, yes!

29
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,203
Oh, I'll kill myself
if Portugal doesn't win.

30
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,915
It's hard to believe this used
to be an internment camp.

31
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,292
Yo, paella man, wing one up here!

32
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,297
Hey, look, it's Pelé!

-(fanfare)
-(cheering)

34
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,845
Pelé is king of the soccer field.

35
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:21,057
To be king of your kitchen,
use Crestfield Wax Paper.

36
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,476
(cheering)

37
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,437

42
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,803
Boring!

43
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,347
Come on, you schnorrers! Do something!

44
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,349
Halfback passes to the center.

45
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,268
Back to the wing.

46
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,312
Back to the center.

47
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,355
Center holds it.

48
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,357
Holds it.

49
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,319
Holds it. (sighs)

50
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,030
Halfback passes to center! Back to wing!

51
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:20,491
Back to center! Center holds it!
Holds it! Holds it!

52
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,077
I can't bear this any longer. I'm leaving!

53
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,079
Yeah, not before me you ain't.

54
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,333
Now, now, there's plenty
of exits for everyone.

55
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,210
Oh, that's it. You're dead, pal!

56
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,880
-Hey, now, that's uncalled for.
-Shut your hole, Skinner!

57
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,257
(gasping, shouting)

58
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,264
(yelling)

59
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,391
You call this a soccer riot?

60
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:50,313
-Come on, boys. Let's take 'em to school!
-Oi! Oi! Oi!

61
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,902
(clamoring)

62
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,407
Homer, we've got to get out of here!

63
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,326
Oh! But I wanna do some rioting.

64
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,455
-(grunts) Jobbers cobknots, ya mucker!
-All done.

65
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,499
Aah!

66
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,755
(siren wailing)

67
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,966
What began as a traditional soccer riot...

68
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,302
has escalated into a citywide
orgy of destruction.

69
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,764
Reacting swiftly, Mayor Quimby
has declared mob rule.

70
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:28,518
So for the next several years,
it's every family for itself!

71
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,395
Ex-Ex-Excuse me, sir.

72
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,481
I think you've got my TV. Sir?

73
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,692
Somebody's gotta stop them!

74
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,568
Let's wait until
they burn the school down.

75
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,904
Oh, my God!
Homer, they're right next door.

76
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,281
Relax, Marge.

77
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,532
If someone tries to get in here,

78
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,909
my burglar alarm will let us know.

79
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,036
(rattling)

80
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,081
-(gasps)
-Watch the fish, Marge.

81
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,710
(groans)

82
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,467
Looks like you called me just in time.

83
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,595
-This home isn't secure at all.
-What did I tell you, Marge?

84
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,473
Intruders could come in down the chimney,
through the mail slot...

85
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,975
even hidden in your groceries.

86
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,314
Did you change the locks
when you moved in? I thought not.

87
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,567
All the previous owners of this house
could still be in here somewhere.

88
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,402
What do you recommend?

89
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,947
Well, a lot of companies would
put in a pretty system that looks good...

90
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,991
but doesn't provide any real protection.

91
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,242
Oh, let's get that!

92
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,785
But if you really wanna sleep
easy at night,

93
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,122
I recommend sealing off every door
and window with bulletproof Lucite.

94
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,124
Wouldn't we all suffocate?

95
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:36,544
-Well, I should hope not.
-Let's get that, the suffocation thing.

96
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,880
And you can have it all for just $500.

97
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:42,300
$500? Aw, forget it.

98
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,721
But surely you can't put
a price on your family's lives.

99
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,474
I wouldn't have thought so
either, but here we are.

100
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:54,270
Homer, we need something
to protect this family.

101
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,605
I couldn't agree more, Marjorie.

102
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,190
You deserve peace of mind...

103
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,568
and peace of mind is what you shall have.

104
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,570
I'd like to buy
your deadliest gun, please.

105
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,114
Aisle 6, next to the sympathy cards.

106
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,243
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

107
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,079
-Mmm!
-Whoa!

108
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,791
-Careful there, Annie Oakley.
-I don't have to be careful. I got a gun.

109
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,959
Well, you'll probably want
the accessory kit.

110
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,211
-Holster.
-Oh, yeah.

111
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,213
-Bandolier.
-Baby.

112
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,881
-Silencer.
-Mm-hmm.

113
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,257
-Loudener.
-Oh!

114
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,510
-Speed-cocker.
-Ooh! I like the sound of that.

115
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,388
And this is for shooting down
police helicopters.

116
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,474
Oh, I don't need
anything like that... yet.

117
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,685
-Just give me my gun.
-Sorry. The law requires

118
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,437
a five-day waiting period.

119
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,481
We've got to run a background check.

120
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,109
Five days? But I'm mad now!

121
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,861
-(grunts)
-I'd kill you if I had my gun!

122
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,488
Yeah, well, you don't.

123
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,992
Lousy big shot. Thinks he's so big 'cause
he's got a lot of guns.

124
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,371
If he didn't have any guns,
I'd show him a thing or two.

125
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,456
What happens when he walks into my store?

126
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,626
Then we'll see who's worried
about five-day waiting periods.

127
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,170
Dad, it's 3:00 a.m.!

128
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,423
Can't you mutter in your room?

129
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,259
-Marge kicked me out.
-(groans)

130
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,011
All right. Go ahead.

131
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,098
Pushy kids think they can tell
me what to do in my house.

132
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:16,602
I tell you, parents these days,
they don't know how to rear children.

133
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,819
Oh! How am I supposed to last five days
without shooting something?

(toilet flushing)

145
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:08,529
Now, I believe you have
some sort of firearm for me.

146
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,906
Well, let's see here.

147
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,367
According to your background check,
you've been in a mental institution.

148
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,078
-Yeah.
-Frequent problems with alcohol.

149
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,290
-(chuckling) Yeah.
-You beat up President Bush.

150
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,042
<i>Former </i>president.

151
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,046
-"Potentially dangerous"?
-Relax.

152
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,340
That just limits you to three
handguns or less.

153
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,299
Whoo-hoo!

154
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,510
Close your eyes, Marge.

155
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,931
-I've got a surprise for you.
-Mmm!

156
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,767
OK, open your eyes.

157
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,767
OK, open your eyes.

158
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,771
-(screams)
-It's a handgun. Isn't it great?

159
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,855
This is the trigger,

160
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,024
and this is the thing you point
at whatever you want to die.

161
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,945
Homer, I don't want guns in my house!

162
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,155
Don't you remember
when Maggie shot Mr. Burns?

163
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,406
I thought Smithers did it.

164
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,408
That would have made a lot more sense.

165
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,660
Hey, Dad, can I borrow the gun tomorrow?

166
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,037
I wanna scare that old
security guard at the bank.

167
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,206
-Only if you clean your room.
-(groans)

168
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,125
-No! No one's using this gun.
-(whimpering)

169
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,087
The TV said you're 58% more likely

170
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,381
to shoot a family member
than an intruder.

171
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,883
TV said that?

172
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,803
But I have to have a gun.
It's in the Constitution.

173
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,098
Dad, the Second Amendment
is just a remnant from revolutionary days.

174
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,058
It has no meaning today.

175
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,602
You couldn't be more wrong, Lisa.

176
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,230
If I didn't have this gun,
the King of England...

177
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:28,192
could just walk in here anytime
he wants and start shoving you around.

178
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,027
Do you want that? Huh?

179
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,280
-Do you?
-No.

180
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:36,033
-All right, then.
-I'm sorry, Homer. No weapons.

181
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,120
A gun is not a weapon, Marge!

182
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:42,164
It's a tool, like a butcher knife
or a harpoon...

183
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,167
or, uh, an alligator.

184
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,087
You just need more
education on the subject.

185
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,257
Tell you what. You come with me to
an N.R.A. meeting,

186
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,970
and if you still don't think
guns are great, we'll argue some more.

187
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:05,563
(beeping)

188
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,607
(beeping stops)

189
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,319
(beeps)

190
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,488
Assault weapons have gotten
a lot of bad press lately...

191
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,407
but they're manufactured for a reason--

192
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,285
to take out today's
modern super animals...

193
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:23,331
such as the flying squirrel
and the electric eel.

194
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,334
-Learning something, Marge?
-(groans)

195
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,378
Uh, hi. I'm Moe S.

196
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,963
Hi, Moe!

197
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,257
Yeah, so last night,
I was closing up the bar

198
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,218
when some young punk comes in
and tries to stick me up.

199
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,013
-(all gasping)
-Whatever did you do, Moe?

200
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,307
Well, it could've been
a real ugly situation...

201
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,685
but I managed to shoot him in the spine.

202
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,229
(applause)

203
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:51,150
Yeah, I guess the next place
he robs better have a ramp.

204
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,403
(laughter)

205
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,238
Hi. I'm Homer S.

206
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,574
-ALL: Hi, Homer!
-Hi.

207
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,578
It seems to me if a gun can
protect something as important as a bar...

208
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,580
it's good enough to protect my family.

209
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,334
So if you'll have me,
I would like to become...

210
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:12,088
a lifetime member
of your wonderful organization.

211
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,924
(cheering, shouting)

212
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,386
Homer, you can't join up
with these gun nuts.

213
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,429
Oh, come on. Be fair, Marge.

214
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,848
For once in your life, be fair!

215
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,517
(groans)

216
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,404
(explosion)

217
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,663
-Sorry!
-My fault.

218
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,915
(whistling)

219
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,461
(gasps) Don't shoot. Just take the money
and get out.

220
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,423
What? Oh, Apu, I would never--

221
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,299
Or would I?

222
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,301
(thinking) <i>I've already gone this far.</i>

223
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:03,723
<i>I wonder what my life would be like if</i>
<i>I robbed the Kwik-E-Mart.</i>

224
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,401
I'll do it. I'll rob the Kwik-E-Mart.

225
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,445
All right, put your-- D'oh!

226
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,864
Oh, well, I'll rob it next time.

227
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,579
Can you help me get my ball
down from the roof, Dad?

228
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,497
Sure thing, honey.

229
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,464
-You want me to get the cat down?
-No, thanks.

230
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,548
HOMER: Pull!

231
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,178
Missed one, Dad.

232
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,768
-See you in Hell, dinner plate.
-(gunshot)

233
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,109
Does anyone know where
all my dinner plates went?

234
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,820
-Um-
-You probably left 'em at work.

235
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,197
On another topic,

236
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,909
guess who was picked to host
the next N.R.A. get-together?

237
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,413
Homer, I told you this morning,
no guns at the dinner table.

238
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,040
You said the breakfast table.

239
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,334
It's the same table!

240
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,795
Listen, if it'll make you feel any better,

241
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,130
I'll put the safety on.

242
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,884
Whoops! Guess it was already on.

243
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,891
Uh, I'd better just put it down.

244
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,688
No offense, Mom, but that was pretty cool.

245
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:40,486
Homer, I think you'd agree that
I've put up with a lot in this marriage.

246
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,828
But this is the first time
since we've been married

247
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,122
that I've actually feared for our lives.

248
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:57,545
So I'm asking you, if you really care
about me and the children...

249
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,714
please, please get rid of the gun.

250
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:11,350
All right, Marge. I'll do it for you.

251
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,686
(moaning)

252
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,688
I'm a lucky woman.

253
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,566
And I'm a wonderful man.

254
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,736
(straining) Aw! I don't feel them.

255
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,740
You said there'd be "Fudgeicles," Bart.
Where's the "Fudgeicles"?

256
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,243
First, it's Fudgsicle.

257
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,121
And I know they're up here.
I just need a better foothold.

258
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,749
Hello!

259
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,879
And the next marksman is
William Tell, Jr.!

260
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,005
Jinx!

261
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,508
(gasps) Bart!

262
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,636
Oh, I see Bart gets to have a gun.

263
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,638
You lied to me!

264
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,391
You promised to get rid of this gun.

265
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,518
I put it in a safe place, Marge.

266
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:58,522
I mean, what are the odds the boy
would look in the vegetable crisper?

267
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,774
How could you?

268
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,986
Of all the terrible things
you've ever done in your life,

269
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,863
this is the worst--

270
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,157
the most despicable!

271
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,827
But, Marge, I swear to you,
I never thought you'd find out!

272
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,203
(groans)

273
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,789
Until you decide what's more important,

274
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,125
your gun or your family,

275
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,002
we can't live in the same house.

276
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,253
Come on, kids.

277
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:26,216
So this is the thanks I get
for protecting my family?

278
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,220
Then go! I'll be just fine!

279
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,601
-Do you know how to cook dinner?
-Do I?

280
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,530
-I've left Homer.
-Thank God.

281
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,699
So we need a place to spend the night.

282
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,996
Try the Sleep-Eazy Motel.
I woke up there once. Seemed nice.

283
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,331
Why can't we stay here?

284
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,751
Uh, we have a gentleman caller.

285
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:04,296
Hey, this TV's not broken.
It's just unplugged. What the-

286
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,885
Ooh, the gun club's gonna be
here any minute.

287
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,844
(doorbell rings)

288
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,972
(gasps) They're here! They're here!

289
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:18,560
Hiya, Homer. I brung ya a big bag of
irregular Oreos.

290
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,316
I don't see what's wrong
with this one. Oh.

291
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,664
Looking for a good time, sailor?

292
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,542
-I certainly am.
-No, you're not!

293
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,419
He's really not.

294
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,713
And that's how,
with a few minor adjustments,

295
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,757
you can turn a regular gun into five guns.

296
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,759
(light applause)

297
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,640
Here's some more
chocolate curls, gun buddies.

298
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,437
Anyone else want a beer?

299
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,565
(all gasp) Homer, you use your gun
as a can opener?

300
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,150
I use it for everything.

301
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,694
Watch me turn on the TV.

302
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,613
-(gunfire)
-(grunting)

303
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,243
I've never seen such recklessness!

304
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:21,081
-You might've hurt someone!
-Are you some kind of moron?

305
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,626
-Yeah, but-
-Hey, <i>yutz. </i>Guns aren't toys.

306
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,297
They're for family protection,
hunting dangerous or delicious animals...

307
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,299
and keeping the king of England
out of your face.

308
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:36,555
-Your membership card please, Homer.
-Oh!

309
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,141
I'll also need to remove your tattoo.

310
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,143
-I didn't get one yet.
-Rats.

311
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,687
Now, since you're no longer a member,

312
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,814
please go outside
until the meeting is over.

313
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,775
(chuckling)

314
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,236
-(disco music playing)
-(laughing, chattering)

315
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,865
-Hey, we got a pool!
-Can we go swimming, Mom?

316
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,786
Mmm, not right now, dear.

317
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,247
Wow! The TV's coin-operated.

318
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,832
And so is the Bible!

319
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,920
I'd like to order a wake-up call, please.

320
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,673
3:00 a.m. Uh, for every room
except this one.

321
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,550
That's right. Good night.

322
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,429
(chuckling) Always love
trying out new material on the road.

323
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,099
BART: No way are you gonna
beat me this time, Lise.

324
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,726
-(coins clinking)
-(voice wavering) Yes, I am!

325
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,980
-Come on, Spotty!
-Come on, Smelly!

326
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,572
(gunfire)

327
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,788
Oh! This gun cost me everything,

328
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,498
my wife, my kids.

329
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:48,085
Everything but my precious, precious gun.

330
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,129
(gunshot)

331
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,591
This stinks. I want my family back.

332
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,095
Hey, is that a camera in the ceiling?

333
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,763
(male voice) <i>No. Go back to sleep.</i>

334
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,225
This bed is making me nauseous!

335
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,477
Why won't it stop?

336
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,897
Honey, it'll be morning soon.
Try to get some sleep.

337
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,233
-(door opens)
-(gasps)

338
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,903
Oh, uh, I'm sorry. Are you planning to
stay the whole night?

339
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,780
-Yes!
-All right.

340
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,241
Vote Quimby.

341
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:24,997
-Marge?
-(man groans)

342
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,957
-Sorry. Marge?
-(woman gasps)

343
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,751
-Oh. Sorry. Marge?
-MAYOR QUIMBY: Vote Quimby.

344
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,004
-Sorry.
-MARGE: Down here, Homer!

345
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:35,966
Oh, Marge, there's so many
things I wanna yell to you!

346
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,843
Come down here!

347
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,845
OK!

348
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,140
Oh, honey, please come home. I need you.

349
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,559
It's dark in the house
and I'm hungry and lonesome...

350
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,687
and there's no one there
to hear my various witty remarks.

351
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,773
-What about the gun?
-It's gone for good, Marge.

352
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,527
I finally realized, what's the point
of having a gun for protection,

353
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,863
if you've got no one to protect?

354
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,073
Oh, Homie.

355
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,075
Mmm!

356
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,245
Come on, kids. We're going home.

357
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,331
BOTH: Yea!

358
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,044
Okeydoke. Here's your bill

359
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,963
and your continental breakfast.

360
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,673
(coughing)

361
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,471
All right, everybody, hands up!

362
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,806
You, give me the cash drawer.

363
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,392
Do what he says. I'm too rich to die.

364
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,312
Freeze, bad guy!

365
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,943
-Vote Quimby!
-OK, man. Don't shoot. Chill.

366
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:41,198
Homer, you said you got rid of
the gun! You lied to me again!

367
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,532
I know I said that,

368
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,618
-but what I secretly meant was--
-Yoink!

369
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,787
(sinister laughter)

370
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,247
The joke's on you, buddy.

371
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,873
There's no bullets in that thing.

372
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,209
-(rattling)
-(laughing)

373
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,253
Yo, give me the bullets.

374
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,506
-OK. don't shoot!
-ALL: Drop it!

375
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,344
Bye!

376
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,346
How did you know we were being robbed?

377
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,431
The clerk here pressed
the silent alarm,

378
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,183
and we picked it up on our scanner.

379
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,270
-Did anyone stop that robber?
-No, I don't think so.

380
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,733
I'm sorry I lied to you, Marge...

381
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,069
but this gun had a hold on me.

382
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,613
I felt this incredible surge of power,

383
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,199
like God must feel
when he's holding a gun.

384
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,243
So please, get rid of it,

385
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,788
because I know I'll just lie
to you again and again.

386
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,550
Hmm!

387
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,695
(theme music playing)

388
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,193
Shh!

389
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,198
