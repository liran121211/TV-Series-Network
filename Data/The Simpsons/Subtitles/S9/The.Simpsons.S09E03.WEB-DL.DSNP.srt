00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:11,509
Oh, let's put Bart's beautiful
drawing up on the fridge...

178
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,635
Homer, stop.

179
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,679
Would you please
look at the drawing?

180
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,348
Oh, all right. What a--
(screams)

181
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,183
Burn it! Send it to hell!

182
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,936
I think we're going to have
to get Bart some help.

183
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,187
Get it away.

184
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,065
Bart, son,
you want to play catch?

185
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,567
-No.
-Oh.

186
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,111
When a boy doesn't want
to play catch with his old man

187
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,821
something is seriously wrong.

188
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,948
I'll play catch
with you, son.

189
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,117
-Get the hell out.
-I'm gone.

190
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:37,952
Ah...

191
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:38,911
Mrs. Simpson, physically

192
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,038
your son is as sound
as the dollar.

193
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,291
I'm afraid Bart's severe
emotional dysfunction

194
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,544
stems from a deep-seated
psychological trauma.

195
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,754
(chuckles)

196
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,006
MARGE:
<i>With nowhere else to turn</i>

197
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,174
<i>we went to see</i>
<i>the school psychologist.</i>

198
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,634
Mr. And Mrs. Simpson

199
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,678
there's nothing
to be alarmed about.

200
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,515
Public school can be
intimidating to a young child...

201
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,934
particularly one with
as many flamboyantly

202
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,687
homosexual tendencies
as your son.

203
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,855
Bart's gay?

204
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:06,772
Bart?

205
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,108
Whoops! Wrong file.

206
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,029
Ah... (stammers) The point
I'm trying to make here

207
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,407
is that Bart must learn
to be less of an individual

208
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,701
and more a faceless slug.

209
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,455
Mmm. Mmm.

210
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,916
Hmm. Lisa,
how old are you?

211
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,169
I am three
and three-eighths.

212
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,631
Mmm. Lisa, if I have five apples

213
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,674
and I take away three apples

214
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,093
how many apples do I have left?

215
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,345
Two apples.

216
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,262
Wait a minute.

217
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,098
She's right.

218
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,642
Yes, very good.

219
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:46,729
Marge, Homer, I believe
your Lisa may be gifted.

220
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,230
That's wonderful,

221
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,358
but still can't you do
anything for Bart?

222
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,902
Marge, he's five. His life is over.

223
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,779
Lisa's the wave of the future.

224
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,405
Wave of the future!

225
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,032
That's right, honey.

226
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,575
If you nurture her gift now

227
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,661
there's no telling what she can do.

228
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,578
Wow.

229
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,247
Just think
of the possibilities.

230
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:09,710
MAN: <i>Lisa Simpson</i>
<i>has won the Nobel prize.</i>

231
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,878
Nah.

232
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,215
<i>Lisa Simpson has won</i>
<i>the Nobel prize...</i>

233
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,299
<i>for kick boxing!</i>

234
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,300
Yah!

235
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,301
<i>Hmm.</i>

236
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,515
Uh... I'll give you the address
of a nice preschool.

237
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,059
(girls chanting)
Cross my heart

238
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,354
and hope to die, here's
the digits that make "pi".

239
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,857
Three point one four one five
nine two six five three five

240
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,485
eight nine seven nine three two
three eight four six two six...

241
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,528
I can assure you

242
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,780
Our preschool is of
the highest quality.

243
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,117
Over 75% of our graduates
go on to first grade.

244
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,494
Well, our little girl has a gift
and we're willing to do

245
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,704
what it takes to help her.

246
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,788
Very good.

247
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,874
Once we receive your $6,000
tuition check, she's in.

248
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,042
I'll give you 50 bucks.

249
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,419
Our fee is
non-negotiable.

250
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,545
Seventy-five!

251
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,880
Look, I knew private school
would be expensive

252
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,550
but I was hoping
we could get a scholarship of some sort.

253
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,802
Sorry. I don't have anything
to offer you

254
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,054
unless you're a member
of a minority group.

255
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,558
<i>Excellente! Muchos gracias,</i>
senorata!

256
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,475
I'm sorry.

257
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,893
(Chinese accent)
Ah, so.

258
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,687
Come on, honey.

259
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,439
I guess this is a world
you'll never know.

260
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:21,031
Our family was suffering
through its worst crisis ever.

261
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,783
Bart was miserable at school

262
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,078
and Lisa's gifts
were going to waste.

263
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,872
Uh... Homer,
it's five years later

264
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,498
and I'm still
miserable at school.

265
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,584
And my gifts are still
going to waste.

266
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,586
And sometimes I feel
so smothered by this family

267
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,629
I just want to scream
till my lungs explode!

268
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,131
(exhales deeply)

269
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,300
Right. I'll go
start dinner now.

270
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,342
You do that.

271
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,969
(Marge grunts)

272
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,807
Hello!

273
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,350
Dad, what are you doing here?

274
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,144
Looking for my teeth.

275
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,605
(muffled barking)

276
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,356
Give me those!

277
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,066
Better wash these off.

278
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,902
Aw, the hell with it.

279
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,572
Well, grampa,
as long as you're here

280
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,824
we were telling a story
that took place

281
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,827
when Bart was five
and Lisa was three.

282
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,038
Oh, I know this story!

283
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,332
The year is
nineteen-aught-six.

284
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,752
The president is the divine
Miss Sarah Bernhard.

285
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,712
And all over America

286
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,883
people were doing a dance called
"The Funky Grandpa!"

287
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,968
<i>♪ Oh, I'm the... ♪</i>

288
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,180
(snoring)

289
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,723
Y-yes.

290
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,184
Well, as if our
troubles weren't bad enough

291
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,521
Springfield was going through
an unseasonable heat wave...

292
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,566
MAN: <i>And so, Springfield's</i>
<i>heat wave continues</i>

293
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,361
<i>with today's temperature</i>
<i>exceeding the record for this date-</i>-

294
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,154
<i>set way back</i>
<i>four billion years ago</i>

295
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,949
<i>when the earth</i>
<i>was just a ball of molten lava.</i>

296
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:48,661
Oh... So hot.

297
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,372
Homer, have you seen
the frozen peas?

298
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,207
(grunts)

299
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,959
Uh... You keep them.

300
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,670
Now, listen, if we can't
afford private school

301
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,005
maybe there's some other way
to encourage Lisa.

302
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,217
Um, an art class... Ballet lessons...

303
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,260
They have some fun things

304
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,387
you could do at
the museum on Saturday.

305
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,638
Nuh-uh. Forget it, Marge.

306
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,558
There is no way I'm spending
my Saturdays at a museum.

307
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,393
Unless...

308
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,396
Museums don't have foosball,
do they?

309
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:17,731
(ting)

310
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,650
You lose, Michelangelo's David.

311
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,734
Who's next?

312
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,903
(screaming) Me!

313
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,573
(Marge groans)

314
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,241
I guess it doesn't matter.

315
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,327
All these things cost money
and we just don't have it.

316
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,829
Unless...

317
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,414
Unless... what?

318
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,207
Well, there's that $200

319
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,585
we've been saving
for the new air conditioner.

320
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,422
Oh, Marge, but we've needed
a new air conditioner for years!

321
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,008
And our stopgap solution
is getting cranky.

322
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,343
(yowling)

323
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,887
I cannot believe this!

324
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,431
I'm trying to give our daughter
a headstart in life

325
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,932
and you aren't helping a bit.

326
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,642
Marge, name one successful person

327
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,436
who ever lived
without air conditioning.

328
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,353
Balzac.

329
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,771
No need for potty mouth

330
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,356
just because you can't
think of one.

331
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,066
But Balzac is the name.

332
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,776
Bup-bup-bup-bup.

333
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,738
If "ifs" and "buts"
were candy and nuts, y...

334
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,531
How did the rest
of that go?

335
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,408
Just promise you won't buy
an air conditioner

336
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,452
till we've figured out
a way to help Lisa.

337
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,495
All right, all right. I promise.

338
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,789
Must be another way
to get an air conditioner.

339
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,541
(engine humming)

340
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,501
Mmm...

341
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,545
Re-circulated air.

342
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,798
(shivering mewing)

343
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,928
Uh, Homer?

344
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,596
What, Flanders?

345
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,641
Well, sir, I hate to be
a suspicious Aloysius on you

346
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,559
but did you steal
my air conditioner?

347
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,609
Well, I admit
it looks bad, Flanders

348
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,860
But haven't you heard of--

349
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,197
"Let he who is without sin
cast the first stone?"

350
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,198
Ow!

351
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,658
Got him, Dad!

352
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,992
(groans)

353
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,329
And so, just as things looked
their worst...

354
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,331
I realized I could make money

355
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,959
selling my medication to deadheads.

356
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,419
Grampa, what are
you talking about?

357
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,421
Uh... Nothing.

358
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,756
As I was saying

359
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,425
things couldn't be worse
for Lisa or Bart.

360
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,844
And the ugly duckling
was amazed to realize

361
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,846
it had grown into
a beautiful swan.

362
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,724
So you see, children,
there is hope for anyone.

363
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,017
-Even me?
-No.

364
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,021
(indistinct chatter)

365
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,442
Uh... Hi.

366
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,695
-Hi.
-I have soy milk.

367
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,531
The doctor says the real kind
could kill me.

368
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,950
I wish I was interesting
like you.

369
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,535
(slurping)

370
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,662
(blows raspberry)

371
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,873
(laughing) You're funny.

372
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:40,874
I am?

373
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,628
Yeah... And the world needs
a clown.

374
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,630
Hmm...

375
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,215
(blowing raspberry) Doody.

376
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,425
(blowing raspberry) Booger.

377
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,093
(all laughing)

378
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,138
Man, that is killer material!

379
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,431
<i>♪ Skinner is a nut ♪</i>

380
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,765
<i>♪ He has a rubber butt... ♪</i>

381
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,225
Young man, I can assure you

382
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,978
my posterior is nothing more
than flesh, bone and...

383
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,730
that metal plate I got in 'Nam.

384
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,731
(gulps)

385
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,899
Now, I want you to knock off
that potty talk right now.

386
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,068
The principal said potty!

387
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,612
(all laughing)

388
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,492
You listen to me, son.
You've just started school

389
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,618
and the path you choose now

390
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,246
may be the one you follow
for the rest of your life.

391
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,164
Now...

392
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,249
what do you say?

393
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,923
Eat my shorts.

394
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,259
All right, I'll eat...
Eat your shorts?

395
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,802
Yeah, eat my shorts!

396
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,803

397
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,346

398
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,806
<i>♪ Buttman ♪</i>

399
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,224
Buttman?

400
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,643
(groans)

401
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:46,607
(sobbing) He's the greatest showman
since that kid who eats worms.

402
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,569
(muffled) My fifteen minutes
of fame are over.

403
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,737
(gulps)

404
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,447
HOMER:
well, Moe, this is it.

405
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,408
Today's the day I get
my new air conditioner.

406
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,659
Congratulations.

407
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,827
Who's the little chick?

408
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,828
I'm Lisa.

409
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,497
She has a gift.

410
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,291
You have 13 pickled eggs
in this jar.

411
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,627
And one cockroach.

412
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,337
(nervous chuckling)

413
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,340
Who are you, sweetheart,
the Health Inspector?

414
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,758
No, but I am.

415
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:13,842
Uh...

416
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,719
Here, have a margarita.

417
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,639
Uh, that's a parasol.

418
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,943
(gasps) Ooh.

419
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,530
Help us, Homer.

420
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,074
Yeah, help us, you fat yutz.

421
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:40,119
(gurgling)

422
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,540
(laughing)

423
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,793
Wow...

424
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,635
A musical instrument?

425
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,304
Could that be a way to encourage
a gifted child?

426
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,265
Just give me a sign!

427
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,603
Eh, works for me.

428
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,148
(bell tingles)

429
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,983
So, what do you like, Lisa?

430
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,568
Viomalin?

431
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,069
Tubamaba?

432
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,445
Obomoboe?

433
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,572
That one.

434
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,700
Oh... Saxomophone.

435
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,703
Two hundred dollars?

436
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,171
Oh, I'll take it.

437
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,173
(plays note)

438
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,924
(giggling)

439
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,762
Would you like
an inscription, sir?

440
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,890
Yeah. "To Lisa,

441
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,226
never forget
your daddy loves..." d'oh!

442
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,479
...and that inscription
is still there today.

443
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,651
Wow. So that's how Lisa
got her sax.

444
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:58,530
Next, I'll tell you the origin
of Maggie's pacifier.

445
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,448
What origin?

446
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,117
We get them for a $1.95
down at the safeway.

447
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,952
But I really liked that story.

448
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,371
But it still doesn't fix this.

449
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,956
You know, Homer...

450
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,416
I think we have
some money

451
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,085
in the air conditioner
account again, hmm?

452
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,087
Oh... But, Marge,

453
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,340
am I doomed to spend
the rest of my life

454
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,716
sweating like a pig?

455
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,218
Yeah, not to mention
looking like a pig,

456
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,469
eating like a pig...

457
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,221
Don't forget the smell.

458
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,805
Will you get off my front lawn?

459
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,932
Why don't you make me?

460
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,642
Why-- Oh, I give up.

461
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,019
Well, don't worry
about me, Dad.

462
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,813
It's not how it looks,
it's how it sounds.

463
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,857
(plays squeaky note)

464
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,025
Oh...

465
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,072
MAN: <i>Well, sir,</i>
<i>we got a scorcher today.</i>

466
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,200
<i>And to cool off,</i>
<i>nothing beats Fruitopia--</i>

467
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,494
<i>the iced tea brewed by hippies,</i>

468
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,081
<i>but distributed by a heartless</i>
<i>multinational corporation.</i>

469
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,753
"Dear Lisa, may your new
saxophone bring you years of...

470
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,088
D'oh!"

471
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,298
(playing Saxophonsolo
from "Baker Street")

472
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,373
You're a good father.

473
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,583
I learned from the master.

474
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,545
Where's Maggie?

475
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,172
Where's Maggie?

476
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,799
I'm not kidding--
I can't see!

477
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,218
My retinas
have detached again.

478
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,095
(both laughing)

479
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,724
-He's blind as a bat.
-That's right!

480
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,018
That's true!

481
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,271
(theme music playing in sax)

482
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,972
HOMER: <i>Lisa, enough saxamaphone already.</i>
