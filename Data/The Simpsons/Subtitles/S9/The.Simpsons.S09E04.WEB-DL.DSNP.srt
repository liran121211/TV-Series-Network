1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,503
MAN: Hmm.

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:05,213
No.

3
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:08,049
No. No.

4
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:11,136
(hearty laugh)

5
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:14,764
No.

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:18,893
Hmm... I think we can do without
the crack pipe.

7
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,021
Oh, hi. As the Fox censor,

8
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:24,315
it's my job to protect you from reality.

9
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,817
And thanks to my prudent editing,

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,444
tonight's special Halloween show

11
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,071
has been rated TV-G.

12
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:33,491
This means there will be
no raunchy NBC-style sex

13
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,369
or senseless CBS-style violence.

14
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,664
So sit back and enjoy a night
of worry-free--

15
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,709
(groaning) What the fudge--

16
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,294
Oh, for Pete's sake!

17
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,295
(groans)

18
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:49,049
Jiminy Christmas! (screams)

19
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,175
Darn it!

20
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,596
(spooky music playing)

21
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,475
(all moaning)

22
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:02,896
(bell clanging)

23
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,908
<i>And that's how an heroic hippo</i>
<i>became a deputy.</i>

24
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,367
Stupid hippo.

25
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,452
<i>This just in.</i>

26
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,121
<i>Tensions continue to mount between</i>
<i>Springfield and France</i>

27
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,333
<i>over Mayor Quimby's</i>
<i>now-famous frog's legs joke!</i>

28
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,377
<i>The French president has threatened</i>
<i>swift and massive retaliation</i>

29
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,797
<i>if he doesn't receive</i>
<i>an immediate apology.</i>

30
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,881
Stupid frog.

31
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:33,551
<i>We now go live to city hall</i>
<i>for Mayor Quimby's response.</i>

32
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,554
<i>I stand by my ethnic slur!</i>

33
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:40,141
<i>Do your worst, you filthy,</i>
<i>pretentious savages!</i>

34
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,186
Homer, you know how unpredictable
the French are.

35
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:47,232
One minute they're kissing a woman's hand,
the next, they're chopping off her head.

36
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,817
What if they start a war?

37
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,653
Relax. I built a bomb shelter.

38
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,906
That's not gonna protect us from anything!

39
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,116
Fine, then don't use it.

40
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,700
-I won't.
-Good.

41
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,494
-I know it's good.
-So do I.

42
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,621
-I'm happy for you.
-You should be.

43
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,210
Now, this baby is called
"The Withstandinator."

44
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:11,965
It can take a six-megaton blast.
No more, no less.

45
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,925
Oooh!

46
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,513
Blankets, radio.

47
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,307
(gasps) Oh, a Gary Larson calendar.

48
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,561
I don't get it. I don't get it.

49
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,522
I don't get it. I don't get it.

50
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,190
I... don't get it.

51
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,817
(romantic accordion music plays)

52
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:34,988
<i>Sacre bleu!</i>

53
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,157
We will show those stupid Americans

54
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,075
who looks like ze frog, eh?

55
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,952
(all chortling)

56
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,790
Ready, aim-

57
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,417
(popping sound)

58
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,013
What the hell was that?

59
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,890
Calling home planet.

60
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,349
This is Ensign Kang reporting

61
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,102
a cigar-shaped object moving
at tremendous speed.

62
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,731
Sure, Kang, I'm writing it all down.

63
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,774
-(chuckles)
-(snorts)

64
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,574
I'll bet I get blamed for this.

65
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:24,621
But, Aquaman, you cannot marry
a woman without gills.

66
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,873
You're from two different worlds.

67
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,124
(bomb whistle sound)

68
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,002
Oooh, I've wasted my life.

69
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,805
You call that prime rib? Yuck.

70
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,521
(horn blaring)

71
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:54,901
It's green, moron!
Earth to stupid guy. Hello?

72
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,905
(groans) Maybe a little friendly punching
will move your ass.

73
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,491
Ha! Still got it!

74
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,453
(wind howling)

75
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,082
Geez, what's with all the dust?

76
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,669
My God!

77
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,129
Everyone's gone!

78
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,298
(whimpers, voice cracking) Little Bart.

79
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,633
(bat striking ball)

80
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,135
-Little Lisa.
-(bat striking ball)

81
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,639
-Little Marge.
-(bat not striking ball)

82
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,724
And the rest!

83
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,978
(sobbing)

84
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:34,482
Oh, I've lost everything! I can't go on!

85
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,026
No. No, no!

86
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:41,698
I can't just wallow in sadness.
It's time to laugh again!

87
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,826
(giddy laughter)

88
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,787
I'm the last man alive...

89
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,416
(voice echoing) and I can do everything
I've always wanted!

90
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:02,635
-(both yelling)
-(bees buzzing)

91
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:07,015
Oh, Spade, why did you put Farley
in charge of the bees?

92
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,143
Hey, buddy, down in front!

93
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,645
(grunts, laughing)

94
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,606

100
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,824
OK.

101
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,410
Hey, what happened to the tunes?

102
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,038
(shrieks)

103
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:33,333
Hey, what the hell's going on?
Where'd you get those cloaks?

104
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,377
Silence! You're talking too loud.

105
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,172
Not everyone died in the blast, Homer.

106
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,966
Some of us were merely horribly mutated.

107
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,760
(laughing)

108
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,928
(gasps) You're mutants?

109
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,348
Uh, we don't like the word
"mutants," Homer.

110
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,767
We prefer "freaks" or "monsters."

111
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,061
We're creating a new perfect society

112
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,939
in which the mistakes
of the past will be eliminated.

113
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,026
And now... you must die.

114
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,278
(all moaning)

115
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,993
-You want me? Come and get me!
-Get him!

116
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,246
-D'oh!
-(all moaning)

117
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,252
(screams) Look, a coffin!

118
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,215
-(engine not turning over)
-(moaning continues)

119
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,217
(engine starting)

120
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,680
-(all shouting)
-After him.

121
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,771
Die, you chalk-faced goons!

122
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,648
(both screaming)

123
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,736
Come on. We just wanna eat your skin.

124
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,321
Go to hell, cloaky!

125
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,161
(tires screeching)

126
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,748
-Safe at last.
-(doorbell rings)

127
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,875
That better not be the mutants.

128
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,754
-(screams)
-MARGE: Homie, is that you?

129
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,425
(gasps) Marge, kids, you're alive!

130
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:09,262
All the layers of lead paint in this house
made it the perfect bomb shelter.

131
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,930
Oh, come here.

132
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,601
(all sighing)

133
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,479
Kinda brings a tear to your eye socket.

134
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,774
Mm-hmm. In the midst of all
the killing and skin eating,

135
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,485
somehow we forgot the love.

136
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,695
Yeah, ain't that always the way?

137
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,780
You get nuts with the skin eating.

138
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:32,493
You know, I don't see any reason
why freaks and norms can't get along.

139
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,995
(all murmuring agreement)

140
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,830
Why not? Yeah.

141
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,292
We can all work together
to build a utopian society

142
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,752
free of violence, hate and prejudice.

143
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:45,548
That sounds beautiful, Ned.
And let me just say...

144
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:49,510
my family and I share your vision
for a better-- Now!

145
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,804
(all gasp)

146
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,599
(all groaning)

147
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,768
Hmph! Friends with mutants-- Right!

148
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:01,606
Now that's the Marge I married.

149
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,442
So, who wants to steal some Ferraris?

150
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,651
LISA: I do! BART: I do!

151
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,736
MARGE: I do!

152
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,864
LISA: Yeah, let's go!

153
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:22,668
Wow, look at all these gadgets.
If I were a nerd, I'd be in heaven.

154
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,088
Good morning, ma'am. Good afternoon, sir.

155
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,049
It passed noon while I was speaking,

156
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,676
so that was technically accurate.

157
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,428
He's crazy.

158
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,058
Hey, Eins-teen,
how much for the mood pants?

159
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:40,228
(mutters) How much you got?

160
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:46,108
Nice try, Floyd, but you were
designed for scrubbing.

161
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,486
And scrubbing is what you shall do.

162
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,075
(whistling)

163
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,577
(hum resonating)

164
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,870
(whistling)

165
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:58,913
Hmm!

166
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,499
I take it from that little impressed noise

167
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:05,378
that you are interested in purchasing
that matter transporter, sir.

168
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,214
Um, two bucks.

169
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:12,426
And it only transports matter.

170
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,388
Um, well, uh-

171
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,056
I'll give you 35 cents.

172
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,559
Sold! But I must warn you

173
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:23,563
this device carries a frighteningly
high risk of catastrophic--

174
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,940
I said I'll take it.

175
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,027
This mountain of stairs
used to make bedtime a grueling chore

176
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,113
but not anymore, baby.

177
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,906
(hum resonating)

178
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,658
(hum resonating)

179
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,911
(chuckling) Good night, losers.

180
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:44,292
Man, how'd I ever live without this thing?

181
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,467
(contented sigh)

182
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,095
Oh, man, that's good!

183
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,807
(grunting) Hmm.

184
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,893
(humming)

185
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,895
-(unzipping)
-Homer, no!

186
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,689
-(zips up pants)
-Oh!

187
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,566
Hey, Dad, can I use
the transporter sometime?

188
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,234
Please, I swear I'll be careful.

189
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,863
Sorry, but this is a highly
sophisti-ma-cated doo-wacky.

190
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,824
If you don't use it responsibly, kablamo!

191
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:20,036
LISA: Ow! Someone just punched
me in the face!

192
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,120
It was your mother!

193
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,253
OK, cat, now if this works,
your next trip will be to the bank vault.

194
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,423
(frantic meowing)

195
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,508
(barking)

196
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,054
(alarm beeping)

197
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,475
(whimpering)

198
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,895
Whoa, cool! Twice the pet
and none of the mess.

199
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,816
Oh! Ugh! You can be Lisa's.

200
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,943
(fly buzzing)

201
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,946
Hmm...

202
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,206
Look, in the sky! It's Superfly!

203
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,876
Oh, I'd be stupid not to do this!

204
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,259
(alarm beeping)

205
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,183
It worked!

206
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,228
Oh... I was hoping to be humongous.

207
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,855
Tch. Oh, well, at least I don't
have two butts.

208
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,651
MARGE: What's going on down there?
What's all this mist?

209
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,111
Uh-oh.

210
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,112
-(banging)
-(groans)

211
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,824
-(banging window)
-Ow! Ow! Oh! Ow! Oh!

212
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,077
Bart, are you in there?

213
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,788
Have you forgotten
our little "kablamo" talk?

214
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,959
(growling)

215
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,460
(all scream)

216
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,465
(blubbering)

217
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,758
Mom, stop!

218
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,554
According to this, it says
Bart mixed up his D.N.A. with a fly's.

219
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,305
I think that's Bart!

220
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,600
(babbling)

221
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,478
I think she's right.
The pants are a dead giveaway.

222
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:15,109
Oh, well, he may be a horrible freak,
but he's still my son.

223
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,486
I'm sure we'll grow to accept him in time.

224
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,823
(slurping)

225
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:28,372
So then Lenny says, "As if! Don't even
go there, sister."

226
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,000
(all laughing)

227
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,169
-Good one, Dad.
-Yeah, well, Lenny said it.

228
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,378
Bluggh!

229
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:39,008
-Blarrr! Blagh!
-Oh. You want more syrup, honey?

230
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,218
There's one thing
I still don't understand.

231
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,930
When Bart went through the transporter,
what happened to his head?

232
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,682
Oh, it'll turn up somewhere.

233
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:53,939
(high-pitched) Help me! Help me!

234
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,816
Sucker!

235
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,785
(slurping)

236
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,039
-(growls)
-OK, OK. It's your sugar, Bart.

237
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,458
That impostor!

238
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,586
(Bart buzzing)

239
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,756
Mom, Dad, I'm the real Bart.

240
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,634
That's just some overgrown fly
with my body.

241
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:25,513
-Somebody listen to me!
-(grunts) Shoo! Shoo, fly!

242
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,848
(grunting)

243
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,851
Listen, buddy. This is all a mistake.

244
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,145
If you'll just go through
the transporter with me again,

245
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,023
we'll have you back
eating garbage in no time.

246
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,692
-Blarrgh!
-(Bart gaaps)

247
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,153
(crashing)

248
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,364
Get him, boy! Smash that fly!

249
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,199
Mush him up good!

250
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,868
Nice work, son.

251
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,455
(thunderclap)

252
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,042
Bart! Is that you?

253
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,629
-(buzzing)
-I can't hear you. Wait.

254
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,756
Fly into my saxophone.

255
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,803
Help me, Lise! That giant fly stole
my body and now he's trying to kill me!

256
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,223
Oh, no! And I let him use my toothbrush!

257
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:13,060
Well, that hideous creep doesn't scare me.

258
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,939
(screaming)

259
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,359
Mom, Dad, help! He's trying to kill me!

260
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,570
Nobody likes a tattletale, honey.

261
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,905
They're like this every rainy day.

262
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,615
(grunting)

263
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,909
Bluggh! Blagh!

264
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,369
(buzzing)

265
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,996
Bluggh! Blagh!

266
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,582
(Bart grunts)

267
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,293
Hey, get my filthy hands off my sister!

268
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:42,047
Whoa! No, don't eat me!
You don't know where I've been!

269
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,887
You just made a big mistake, fly-boy!

270
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,599
(grunting)

271
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,394
Hey, it worked!

272
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,022
Well, we were lucky this time.

273
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:02,192
But it's all too clear that some things
in this universe

274
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,320
aren't meant to be trifled with.

275
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,905
Homer, what are you doing?

276
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,867
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

277
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,119
I'll teach you to mess with my machine!

278
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:15,456
-(screams)
-I'm gonna chop you good!

279
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,374
That cost me 35 cents!

280
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,753
You're just making it worse!
I promise I won't hurt you!

281
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,721
(animal howling)

282
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,477
QUIMBY: You are all hereby found guilty
of the crime of witchcraft.

283
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,647
I sentence you hags
to be burned at the stake

284
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,733
until you are deemed fit
to reenter society.

285
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,109
Fire it up, boys.

286
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,615
-(crowd cheering)
-Ha-ha!

287
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,952
-See you in hell, Seymour!
-Good-bye, Mother.

288
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,828
How horrible!

289
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,290
If they're really witches,
why don't they use their powers to escape?

290
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,627
-That sounds like witch talk to me, Lisa.
-Never mind.

291
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,088
Well, that's 75 witches we've processed.

292
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,966
That ought to show God whose side
we're on, eh, Pastor?

293
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:11,220
Yes, Nedwin, but we have
many more strumpets to incinerate.

294
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:16,684
Brothers and sisters,
there is still a witch among us.

295
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,979
Let us throw open the floor
to, uh, wild accusations.

296
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,523
Whoo-hoo! I accuse Goodie Flanders!

297
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,775
-(gasps)
-(crowd murmuring)

298
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,986
I accuse Goodie Badwife.

299
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,654
Uh, we killed her on Sunday.

300
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,906
Well, there must be someone here
we can accuse.

301
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,659
-Lisa Simpson!
-Bart, quit it!

302
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,703
She put a spell on me!

303
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,163
Must... drop... pantaloons.

304
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,164
-(groans)
-Whoa!

305
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,583
Let's come to our senses, everyone.

306
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,336
This witch hunt is turning into a circus.

307
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,379
-She's the witch!
-(crowd shouting)

308
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,047
Yeah! She's the witch!

309
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,173
I was just about to accuse her.

310
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,968
This is crazy. I'm not a witch!

311
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:54,972
Ha! Then how come your laundry
is always much whiter than mine?

312
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:59,977
-Oh, I've heard enough. Burn her!
-ALL: Burn her! Burn her!

313
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,855
People, let us not turn into an angry mob.

314
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,734
Goodie Simpson is entitled to due process.

315
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,111
OK, here's how the process works.

316
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,530
You sit on the broom
and we shove you off the cliff.

317
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,532
-What?
-Well, hear me out.

318
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:17,286
If you're innocent, you will fall
to an honorable Christian death.

319
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,371
If, however, you are the bride of Satan,

320
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,082
you will surely fly your broom to safety.

321
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,669
At that point, you will report back here
for torture and beheading.

322
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,712
Tough, but fair.

323
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,880
Stop!

324
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:32,551
Doesn't the Bible say,
"Judge not lest ye be judged"?

325
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,887
(murmuring agreement)

326
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,847
The Bible says a lot of things. Shove her!

327
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,015
(gasps)

328
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,308
(screaming)

329
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,686
(screaming)

330
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,314
Brothers and sisters...

331
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,649
we have performed the Lord's work

332
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,862
and sent a good woman into his waiting--

333
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:55,157
-(gasping)
-(cackling)

334
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,953
OK, now, let's not jump
to conclusions, everyone.

335
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,247
Well, I'll be a son of a witch.

336
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,792
That's right, I'm a witch.

337
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,252
And I'm the one
who withered your livestock,

338
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,547
soured your sheep's milk
and made your shirts itchy.

339
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,426
-Hey, you destroyed my turnip crop.
-No, that was gophers.

340
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,012
Impossible. We burned all the gophers.

341
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,348
Not all of them.

342
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,101
(screaming)

343
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,937
And this is for pushing me off the cliff!

344
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,106
-MAN: Whoa! Whoa!
-(all gasping)

345
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,233
All right, people, nothing to see here.

346
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,610
Yeah, show's over, all right? Move along.

347
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:35,030
As for the rest of you-- (cackling)

348
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,282
(screaming)

349
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,244
(gasps) They're in my hair!
They're in my hair!

350
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,212
Mmm, mmm, mmm...

351
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,381
This needs more eye of newt.

352
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,258
You always want more eye of newt.

353
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,219
If it were up to you, the brew
would be nothing but newt eyes.

354
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,055
Well, look who's here.

355
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,683
If I knew you were coming,
I'd have baked a cat.

356
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:06,812
What a day! They found out I was a witch,
so I had to leave my family.

357
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:10,482
Really? So you finally left Durwood.

358
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,151
His name is Homer.

359
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,115
Oh, Neddie, look at them up there,
plotting our doom.

360
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,034
They could force us to commit
wanton acts of carnality.

361
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,829
-(scoffs) Yeah, that'll be the day.
-What's that, Ned?

362
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,123
Uh, we shouldn't fear the witches, Maude.

363
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:30,043
We're both 35. We've already gone
way past our life expectancy.

364
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,172
But think of the children! I heard
that witches come to your house

365
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,674
<i>and take your children away to eat them!</i>

366
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:39,178
Hmm. Eat their children.

367
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,014
Geez, we were just
gonna swipe their shoes.

368
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,309
But a good idea is a good idea.

369
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,858
(all cackling)

370
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,363
-NED: Who is it?
-ALL: Witches!

371
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,990
MAUDE: Um, what do you want?

372
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,034
We're here to eat your kids.

373
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,078
NED: OK, come on in...

374
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,705
and look at this!

375
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,832
Oh, please!

376
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,543
Now make with the kids.

377
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,298
Don't blame yourself, Daddy.

378
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,926
(muffled) You did everything you could.

379
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,305
(whimpers) Maude, do something.

380
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,934
Oh. Uh, well, excuse me.

381
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:31,355
Are you sure you ladies wouldn't prefer
some gingerbread children instead?

382
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,482
-They're boneless.
-ALL: Hmm?

383
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,572
-ALL: Mmm.
-CHILDREN: Ow!

384
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,199
(hooting)

385
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,496
Bye, witches. Thanks for not eating me.

386
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,581
Yeah, you hags are all right.

387
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:51,792
What did you get?

388
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,128
-A candied apple.
-I got a caramel cod.

389
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:01,468
Mmm, you know, scaring people
into giving us treats is fun.

390
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,345
We should do this every year.

391
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,181
I just wish we hadn't filled up
on all those kids

392
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,100
before we got to the Flanders'.

393
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,184
(belches)

394
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:13,313
(all cackling)

395
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:17,526
Yar, and that's the story
of the very first caramel cod.

396
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,696
I mean, Halloween. And it wasn't long

397
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,825
before this yearly custom
became an annual tradition.

398
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,623
(children chattering)

399
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,713
(grunting)

400
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,550
Come on! Give us some candy!
Don't pretend you're not home.

401
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,468
Dad, that's our house.

402
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,805
(crowd laughing)

403
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,890
-She's a witch!
-MAN: Get her! Get her!

404
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,893
-(crowd shouting)
-(Lisa screaming)

405
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,687
Burn her! Burn her!

406
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,819
(woman screaming)

407
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,406
