D'oh!

00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,511

00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,114

(thuds)

8
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,159
Good evening.
I'm Kent Brockman.

9
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:37,245
Our top story:
hunks, and lots of them

10
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,455
and all to raise money

11
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,914
for the Springfield Fire Department

12
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:43,001
to buy a fire engine
so they can get to fires.

13
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,127
Lazy bums.

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,546
Yeah, why don't we buy them
mink stoles while we're at it?

15
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,798
(laughing) Yeah. Good one.

16
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,968
And now, let's hear it
for our celebrity auctioneer--

17
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,470
Krusty.

18
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,638
ALL: What? Who? Who's that?

19
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,848
(murmuring continues)

20
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,349
The clown.

21
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,602
AUDIENCE: Oh!

22
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,853
(applauding)

23
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,272
(cheering)

24
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,360
Thank you. Thank you.

25
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,323
Hey, hey!

26
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,324
Heh?

27
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,492
No, I ain't reading that.

28
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,744
No, not that, either.

29
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,455
OK, let's bring on
our first bachelor.

30
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,790
(cheering)

31
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,333
All right, ladies,
this sexy fellow

32
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:27,378
describes himself
as "a big, thirsty teddy bear."

33
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,798
Say hello to Barney Gumbel.

34
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,555
OK, now, what am I bid?

35
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,433
Hey, now, I got zero,
I got no bid here. I got zero.

36
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,726
I'm standing at zero.

37
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,727
Anybody want to go
higher than zero?

38
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,812
I got zero right now.

39
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,105
OK, over there? No, zero.

40
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,565
I got <i>nada, </i>zilch.
I got bupkes.

41
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,526
I got zero. Nothing. Hey.

42
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,194
Poor Barney.

43
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,362
(sighs)

44
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,030
This lot is withdrawn.

45
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,532
(belches)

46
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,285
(music starts again)

47
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,709
Come on!

48
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,129
He likes sunsets--
what more do you want?

49
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:11,756
Arr.

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,509
I'm... not attractive.

51
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,345
The last bachelor likes women

52
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,764
who take their clothes off
for money.

53
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,182
Let's hear it for Moe.

54
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,651
Why do we have to stand here?

55
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,027
This is so humiliating.

56
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,363
Aren't there any good
bachelors in this town?

57
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,158
Ah, we're never going
to get that fire engine.

58
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,201
Well, I guess that's it, folks.

Apu, you're a bachelor.
Get up there.

62
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,626
Oh, no, no. please,
I am nothing special.

63
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,546
Don't be shy. Excuse me.

64

Excuse me. We have
one more bachelor.

Oh, um...
(clears throat)

68
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,807
Well, I have a doctorate
in Computer Science.

69
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,601
-Oh.
-Sounds pretty good to me.

70
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,687
Um... I run my own business,
of course.

71
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,230
Well. Well, now.

72
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,524
I do like to cook.

73
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:15,069
I'm not much of a talker,
but I love to listen,

74
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,198
and in my leisure time,
I like to build furniture

75
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,490
and then, to have a discussion

76
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,159
about where it could be
placed in a room.

77
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,329
-Now you're talking.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

78
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,247
-Fifty dollars.
-Seventy-five.

79
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,250
You better have enough
to pay my alimony, Luann!

80
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,377
-Three hundred.
-Three-fifty.

81
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,631
Nine hundred and twenty-six.

82
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,799
Sold, to the five
desperate chicks.

83
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,219
Whoo! All right, We got him!
Woof!

84
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,845
Holy molly!

85
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,306
Well, look
who's the ladies man.

86
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,307

87
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,017
(goofy giggling)

88
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,524
I had a great time, Apu.

89
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,318
And thanks for winning wubbsy.

90
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,779
I had no idea
you were such a great shot.

91
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,948
Oh, yes.
all Kwik-e-mart managers

92
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,991
must be skilled
in the deadly arts.

93
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,409
Oh.

94
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:10,250
Oh. That date
will not be easy to top,

95
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,377
but we shall see.

96
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,461
(honking)

97
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,840
Anybody up for
some clog dancing?

98
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,300
Why don't you try and stop me?

99
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,761
(tires screeching)

100
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,263
"This is just

101
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,140

I think about you every day

102

and when I get
you all alone..."

103
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,562
Well, it gets
a little bit personal here.

104
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,605
I understand...

105
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,648
Yoink!

106
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,899
-Wow.
-I know.

107
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,610
-Whoa!
-Tell me about it.

108
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,779
(lustful moaning)

109
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,199
Oh. Here's one from my mother.

110
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,160
Ooh. Let's see what <i>she </i>wrote.
(lustful growling)

111
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,417
-(screams)
-You hate lotus flowers, too?

112
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,419
Don't get me started
on lotus flowers.

113
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,254
No, no, it is the sign

114
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,756
that it is time
for my arranged marriage.

115
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,842
Oh, well, congratulations.

116
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,969
No, no. Don't you
know what it means?

117
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,096
Not... really.

118
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:09,892
It all happened shortly after
my eighth birthday.

119
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,520
OK, here we go.

120
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,817
Ten goats and an electric fan?

121
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,569
You call that a dowry?

122
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,697
OK, we will throw in
a textile factory

123
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,033
but only because Manjula
is getting on in years.

124
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,367
Then it is agreed.

125
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,078
Your third daughter
will marry our first son.

126
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,540
It is done.

127
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,047
Oh, I cannot get married.

128
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,716
I'm just beginning
to enjoy my bachelorhood.

129
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,509
(sighs) What am I going to do?

130
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,887
Tell her the truth, you're
not ready to get married.

131
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,972
No, no. You do not know Mother.

132
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,682
She will never quit
until I am married.

133
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,392
Then just tell her
you're already married.

134
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,728
No. I cannot lie to my mother.

135
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,979
Then get married.

136
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,647
What the hell
do you want from me?

137
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,651
Yes, that is right, Mother.
I already got married.

138
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,321
Why did not I bother
to tell you?

139
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,739
Well... uh...

140
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,617
the reason is, um...

141
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,745
Well, I guess I...
I didn't think you'd understand.

142
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,497
Oh, got to go. Bye-bye-bye.
I love you, love you.

(kissing)

144
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,918
It worked. It worked.

145
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,128

and this lottery ticket.

I have... this much.

162
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,467
I'm sorry. You do not have
enough for both.

163
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,430
Oh. Ooh...
Ooh... Oh...

164
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,931

168
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:20,481
I'm not the type
to kiss and tell, sir,

169
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,526
but listen to this...

170
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,777

171
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,862

172
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,280
It is my mother.

173
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,408
Oh, no. Oh, no.
What am I going to do?

174
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,909
What's the big problem?

175
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,787
Don't you see?
She is here to meet my wife.

176
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,166
The wife that I told her I had.

177
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,961
Ah! I do not have a wife.

178
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,963
Then maybe you shouldn't
have said told her you did.

179
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,756
Oh. She's going to be here
any second.

180

00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,052
Oh, yes!
That will buy me some time.

182
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,097
Mm. Homer,
you've got to help me.

183
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,184
(munching) OK.

184
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,769
Seems to me...

185
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,062
(clearing throat)

186
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,606
What you ought to do is, um...

187
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,774
What, what, what, what, what?

188
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,945
Well... you could always
move into my house

189
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,615
and tell your mom
that Marge is your wife.

190
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,159
Is it me, or do your
plans always involve

191
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,744
some horrible web of lies?

192
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,037
-It's you.
(door opens)

193
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,290
Welcome to the Kwik-e-mart.

194
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,292
May I help... (gasps) Mother!

195
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,003
What are you doing here?

196
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,965
I have come to meet
this wife of yours.

197
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,884
And meet her you shall.

198
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,763
It is a very reasonable request
that can easily be granted

199
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,057
-in a timely and efficient...
-Let's go.

200
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,018
And we shall because it is
in the going that we...

201
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,603
Tat-tat-tat-tat-tat.

202
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,981
Oh... that yodel was so good.

203
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,734
-I wish I was eating it right now.
-(car door opens)

204
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,071
Oh, crap! I forgot!

205
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,198
Marge, I need a small favor.

206
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,659
For the next few days,
will you pretend to be Apu's wife?

207
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,369
-What?
-(doorbell rings)

208
00:08:56,452 --> 00:09:00,248
Please. It's just for as long
as his mother's living here.

209
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,124
What?

210
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,169
Honey, I am in my home.

211
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,841
(nervous chuckle)

212
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,511
(groans)

213
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,554
Oh...

214
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,514
How was your day...

215
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,349
sweetheart?

216
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,018
Can you feel the love?

217
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,649
Mother, I would like
for you to meet

218
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,443
my darling wife
for many, many good years,

219
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,279
M... Marge.

220
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,907
Hello. so, what brings
you to America?

221
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,617
I have come to see the woman

222
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,453
for whom Apu was willing
to disgrace his family

223
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,163
and spit on his culture.

224
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,790
Oh.

225
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,041
Here I am!

226
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,668
OK. Gotta run.

227
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,420
Apu, I'm sure you want
to get upstairs

228
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,172
and fix that broken toilet
before Marge yells at you again.

229
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,926
I'm just so honored
to have you here in our home.

230
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,886
Thank you.
and having met you

231
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,890
let me say how deeply,
deeply disappointed I am.

232
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,685
Apu, your arranged
bride, Manjula

233
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,812
is a sweet, refined,
chaste woman.

234
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,188
Are you nuts?

235
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,441
Mother, come on.
You know that

236
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,068
one out of every
25 arranged marriages

237
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,236
ends in divorce.

238
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,822
Oh, Bart and Lisa!

239
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,366
You remember your father, Apu.

240
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,494
Well, this is your father
Apu's mother.

241
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,998
-Oh!
-Oh!

242
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,875
-Hi.
-Hi.

243
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,628
I cannot believe
you did not tell me

244
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,755
I had two grandchildren.

245
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,674
(sucking)

246
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,928
But you can't leave.

247
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,889
We're scamming
an old lady at my house

248
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,474
and I need a place to hide out.

249
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,558
Sorry, Homer.

250
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,477
I've been planning
this vacation for years.

251
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,312
I'm finally going
to see Easter Island.

252
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,314
Oh, right,
with the giant heads.

253
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,982
With the what, now?

254
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,278
-(snoring)
-Hey, Dad,

255
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,990
I've come to spend some time
with my favorite father.

256
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,200
Baloney!

257
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,869
You came here
to put me in a home!

258
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,371
You're already in a home.

259
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,289
Oh, how could you?

260
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,168
Abraham Simpson.

261
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,712
Cornelius Talmadge.

262
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,047
Oh, no, I'm not...

263
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,882
Oh, well, let's see
what you got here.

264
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,677
The pink ones
keep you from screaming.

265
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,013
All right, folks,
it's supper time.

266
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,057
Supper at 4:00?

267
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,850
Oh-ho, what a sweet deal.

268
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,187
Hey, they got chairs
with wheels,

269
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,107
and here I am,
using my legs like a sucker.

270
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,068
(wheelchair squeaking)

271
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,862
(motor humming)

272
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,576
Whoo! I must apologize
for the inconvenience, Marge.

273
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,203
You are a real sport.

274
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,915
Right. How much longer
is she going to be here?

275
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,418
Homer was a little
sketchy on the details.

276
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,586
It should not be more
than a few days.

277
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,714
She really, truly hates you.

278
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,011
Can I ask you about your dot?

279
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,930
What would you like to know?

280
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,640
What's the deal with that dot?

281
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,808
Yeah, can you see out of it?

282
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,727
Does it change colors
when you're ticked off?

283
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,478
You tell me.

284
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,480
Nothing yet.

285
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,608
Surely, you children are aware
of your Brahman heritage?

286
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,609
As long as you have

287
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,612
absolutely no follow-up
questions, yes.

288
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,739
Yes, we are.

289
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,990
Fully.

290
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,783
We have to go now.

291
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,746
(whistling)

292
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,831
Jasper.
Gladys.

293
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,000
Beatrice.
Looking good, Hattie.

294
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,170
Asa.
Hazel. Hazel.

295
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,379
Hazel!

296
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,422
Oh, the hell with her.

297
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,631
Hester.

298
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,008
Emil. Prudence.

299
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,885
Lemuel. Increase.

300
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,595
-Dad.
-Cornelius.

301
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,764
-(bell tinkling)
-WARDEN: Supper time!

302
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,099
(grunts)

303
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,062
Oh, no, you don't!

304
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,689
Oh, yes, I do.

305
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,316
(grinding)

306
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,945
Eat my dust.

307
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,824
Wow, someone sure likes
his kidney mush.

308
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,034
Damn right.

309
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,042
Mm. Who knew that Lays
made liquid potato chips?

310
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,919
I can't suck just one.

311
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,671
-(buzzing)
-Another bag of chips, Mr. Talmadge?

312
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,132
Please.
Also, I'm getting a bed-sore.

313
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,134
What do you have to do
to get turned around here?

314
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,220
(monitor beeping)

315
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,931
(grunting)

316
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,766
Hey, what's Lucky hooked up to?

317
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,976
A respirator.

318
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,561
It breathes for him.

319
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,480
And here I am,
using my own lungs

320
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,606
like a sucker.

321
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,316
And how come everyone
gets a bedpan

322
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,527
and I have to walk
all the way over there?

323
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,861
You mean, there?

324
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,404
Yeah!

325
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,991
Hello. I'm Cornelius Talmadge.

326
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,285
My family brought me here
on Monday

327
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,705
but I broke free
and went on a bit of a bender.

328
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,041
Wait a minute.
If you're Cornelius Talmadge,

329
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,417
then who's...

330
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,921
HOMER: When I get old, Marge,

331
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,590
I want you to promise
you'll put me in a home.

332
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,716
It's like being a baby,

333
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,552
only you're old enough
to appreciate it.

334
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,637
Well, I'm glad
you were having fun

335
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,640
because I've had my hands full
with Apu's mother.

336
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,017
Oh, right, right.

337
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,936
The fake marriage thing.

338
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:14,979
How's that going?

339
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:15,980
(door creaking)

340
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,857
OK, Apu, I am packed

341
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,067
and ready to go
to the airport... (screams)

342
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,486
Oh, my God.

343
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,780
Marge, how could you?

344
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,949
Oh, Apu, give it up.

345
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,286
(groans)
Mother, I am so sorry.

346
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,413
I lied to you
about being married.

347
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,164
Lied to his mother.

348
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,583
Tsk-tsk-tsk.

349
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,253
But the fact that I would stage
this ridiculous farce

350
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,714
surely proves to you
how much I do not want

351
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,924
to go through with
this arranged marriage.

352
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,511
I had no idea
how strongly you felt, Apu.

353
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,597
Now wipe that smile
off your face.

354
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,806
We have a wedding to plan.

355
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,308
(groans)

356
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,684
You know what you
could do, Apu?

357
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,685
Yeah, shut up.

358
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,145
You could fake your own death.

359
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,396
Oh, would you shut up?

360
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,856
All you need
is a car bomb and...

361
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,066
I can't believe
you don't shut up!

362
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,821
Yes, yes, Manjula.

363
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,657
I will take care
of all the wedding plans.

364
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,243
You just get on a plane
and come to America.

365
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,786
(clearing throat)

366
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,204
I have to go.

367
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,081
(speaking native language)

368
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,042
Believe me, I'd like to.

369
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,710
(laughing)

370
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,961
Good-bye.

371
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,840
I've been looking over
this list of things for the ceremony.

372
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,926
I've got the extra wine glasses

373
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,804
but I'm still short
a tandoori oven, an elephant

374
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,598
and four castrati.

375
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,724
What's a castrati?

376
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,268
I don't know,
but I'm sure it's spicy.

377
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,896
-Why is that woman still living here?
-Mm-mm.

378
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,107
Hey, you seen Apu lately?

379
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,609
He looks terrible.

380
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,861
Yeah, rumor has it
Marge threw him out.

381
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,489
Ah, tough break.
She's a beautiful lady.

382
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,949
You got that straight, Barn.

383
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,034
ALL: To Marge!

384
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,413
Moe, what do you recommend
for severe depression?

385
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,832
Booze, booze and more booze.

386
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,503
Huh! Nothing like a depressant
to chase the blues away.

387
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,338
Yeah, you got that right.

388
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:09,134
Oof. Manjula and I have not seen
each other in 20 years.

389
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,595
Two people cannot fall
in love sight-unseen.

390
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,472
Hey, hold on there.

391
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,515
I'm counting on that.

392
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,935
Well, just 24 hours
of freedom left.

393
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,478
Actually, it's more like 12.

394
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,021
No. I'm so stupid.

395
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,648
Seven-- it's seven hours.

396
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,774
You have seven hours.

397
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,234
See? Seven.

398
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,610
(groaning)

399
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,155
(singing sadly)
<i>♪ Well, I'm hot-blooded ♪</i>

400
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,283
<i>♪ Check it and see ♪</i>

401
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:38,747
<i>♪ I got a fever of 103 ♪</i>

402
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:42,459
Come on, you shouldn't be spending
your last hours of bachelorhood

403
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,752
in a dump like this.

404
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,921
You should be living
like there's no tomorrow

405
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,090
and I know just the place.

406
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:52,886
Ah, is this the life or what?

407
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,305
You want me
to turn on the bubbles?

408
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,520
Which Bombay
to Springfield flight is she on?

409
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,106
The 10:00, the 10:15,
or the 10:30?

410
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,150
I am so terribly sorry, sir.

411
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,194
It appears that your tiger
has been sent to St. Louis.

412
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,156
Mm-hmm. I should send you
to St. Louis.

413
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,199
No. no. He's not worth it.

414
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,536
Can you please indicate
your tiger type on this chart.

415
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,539
BOTH: Mm...

416
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,291
Number six.

417
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,961
How's that fire ring coming?

418
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,337
Is it sacred yet?

419
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,547
Almost.

420
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,341
I... can't...

421
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,843
Can you believe it?

422
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,012
Tradition forbids me
even to speak

423
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,264
to the woman I'm about
to spend my life with.

424
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,099
Has the whole world gone crazy?

425
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,018
Nah, just your screwy country.

426
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:45,189
(sighs) Your old friend Apu
is a lamb being led to the slaughter.

427
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,398
Don't worry, Apu.

428
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,234
Someday, you'll meet
someone you <i>really </i>love.

429
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,361
I'm really doomed.

430
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,073
Only the gods could stop
this wedding now.

431
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,116
Gods, eh?

432
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,826
(indistinct chatter)

433
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,832
No, no, no, no, no.

434
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,042
No pansies for me.

435
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,044
It's the tradition in India.

436
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,505
Yeah, all right.
It'll cover the gravy stains.

437
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,840
-Hey!
-Tradition.

438
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,134
Thanks for helping
us out, Reverend.

439
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,845
I know you've never performed
a Hindu ceremony.

440
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,014
Well, Christ is Christ.

441
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,433
Plus, I consulted
a Hindu web site.

442
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,187
(playing fanfare)

443
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,610
(gloomily) Hello, everyone.

444
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,779
What a happy, happy day.

445
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,240
Wow, I wish I had an elephant.

446
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,492
You did. His name was Stampy.

447
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,494
-You loved him.
-Oh, yeah.

448
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,080
(squeaking)

449
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,498
(trumpeting)

450
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,999
(gasping)

451
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,043
Lucky mouse.

452
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,675
(fanfare plays)

453
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,555
(all gasping)

454
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,890
Oh... Manjula?

455
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,144
Apu, remember me?

456
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,604
Obviously not.

457
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,189
(crashing)

458
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,317
HOMER: I am the God Ganesh!

459
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,194
This wedding angers me!

460
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,322
All will die
unless it is stopped!

461
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,993
-Oh, God.
-Please! listen to me!

462
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,036
(wailing)

463
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,331
(speaking in Hindi)

464
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,457
(screams)

465
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,084
Stop chasing Ganesh!

466
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,795
You're just going
to get more wrath.

467
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:35,048
Oh, I'm afraid
this is all my fault, Manjula.

468
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,134
To be perfectly honest
with you,

469
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:40,012
I have not exactly
been looking forward

470
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,638
to this arranged marriage.

471
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,223
(scoffs) Nor have I.

472
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,225
Marrying a complete stranger?

473
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,518
It is crazy.

474
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,686
All right.

475
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,646
Ganesh has been subdued.

476
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,482
HOMER (whimpering):
All will die.

477
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,109
Resume the ceremony.

478
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,946
Quickly, tell me. What is your favorite
movie, book and food?

479
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,284
Uh, the answer to all three
is fried green tomatoes.

480
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,493
(laughing)

481
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,661
(laughing)

482
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,371
That... that is good.

483
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,290
(clears throat)
Double-parked.

484
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh, I am so torn.

485
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,837
You are clearly
so quick-witted and beautiful.

486
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,923
And when I look in your eyes,

487
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:20,344
I see that sweet little boy
who sold me my very first kiss

488
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,638
and I liked it.

489
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,767
Oh, do you think this marriage
could really work?

490
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,145
Who knows?
We can always get divorced.

491
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,355
Of course.

492
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,273
God bless America.

493
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,326
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

494
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,579
let me be the first
to present to you

495
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:52,417
Mr. and Mrs. Apu
Nahasapeemapetilan.

496
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,045
(cheering)

497
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,967
Ah, geez.
I am no good at weddings.

498
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,843
I am no good at weddings.

499
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:09,518
(singing "Close To You"
in Hindi)

500
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,900
Dad, those peanuts
aren't for you.

501
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,735
They're for the elephant.

502
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,779
Screw him.
(gasping)

503
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,365
Put me down!
Ganesh commands you!

504
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,825
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

505
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,703
Well, so far so good,
don't you think?

506
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,580
I cannot wait to show you
our apartment.

507
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,748
Apartment?

508
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,625
Oh, no, no, no.

509
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,252
You must buy me a house,

510
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,628
and you're getting a haircut.

511
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,047
-Oh.
-Got you.

512
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,883
(laughing)

513
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:46,680
Homer (screaming):
Come on, elephant! Stop!

514
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:50,976
(yelping, groaning)

515
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,103
Hey, everybody's upside-down.

516
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,938
(laughing)

517
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,448
(theme music playing)

518
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,567
Shh!
