00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,329
(along with clock ticking) Mm, mm, mm.

00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:39,706
Oh, yeah.

Mmm.

I have it going on.

17
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,775
Good Lord! The rod up that man's butt

18
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,735
butt must have a rod up its butt.

19
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,278
Oh, Superintendent Chalmers,

20
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,655
can I offer you a cup of
coffee-flavored Bevarine?

21
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,075
Yeah. I take it gray, with Creamium.

22
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,077
But first, before Skinner shows up,

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,787
I have a secret announcement.

24
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,581
In honor of Seymour's 20th year
as principal,

25
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,709
we've decided to hold a surprise
tribute Friday night.

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,587
It's my 20th year, too.

27
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,673
(scoffs) The teachers' lounge
is for teachers, Willie.

28
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,925
(groans, scoffs)

29
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:32,842
(door slams)

30
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,344
And for the tribute,

31
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,554
I need a volunteer
to present an oral report...

32
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,556
on Principal Skinner's life.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,850
Miss Hoover, which one is "oral"?

34
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,644
Out of your mouth, Ralph.

35
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,521
(sighs) Volunteers.

36
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,942
-Thank you, Lisa.
-Uh, no, Miss Hoover. I'm Ralph.

37
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,319
I only need one volunteer, Ralph.

38
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,988
Miss Hoover, which one is "one"?

39
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,990
Ralph and I could do the report together.

40
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,409
-It's your funeral.
-RALPH: Miss Hoover.

41
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,663
(humming)

42
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,957
Bart, why are you doing that?

43
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,251
Our class is making refreshments
for Skinner's party.

44
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,794
These are in honor of his army days.

45
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,796
Oh, that explains the flags.

46
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,506
What about the dog food?

47
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,384
My theory is... Skinner likes dog food.

48
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,761
(groans) Let's bake him a cake.

49
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,973
Ooh! A fresh batch of America balls!

50
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,809
(chomping loudly)

51
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,983
WOMAN: Seymour, tell me
what time it is, now!

52
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,985
Seven o'clock, Friday night, Mother.

53
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,903
Time for our weekly silhouette.

54
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,991
No! Cutting out your ugly nose
gives me a hand cramp!

55
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,868
Oh, but you love silhouette night.

56
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,120
And then we go through your bird book

57
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,997
and make up silly captions...

58
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,832
Mother, why are you all dressed up?

59
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,793
I'm sick of this house,
and I'm sick of you!

60
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,503
Tonight we're going for a drive.

61
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,423
Mmm, what's so special about tonight?

62
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,217
Nothing! Now put on your
special suit and get in the car!

63
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,302
Yes, Mother.

64
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,681
Why are we stopping at my school, Mother?

65
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,767
-What does it say on that sign?
-I don't like your tone!

66
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,396
ALL: Surprise!

67
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,356
(chattering, laughing)

68
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,609
Happy anniversary, son.

69
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,819
Oh, Mother. (sniffles)

70
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,197
You are still the master of deception.

71
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,449
-I surely am.
-CROWD: Ah.

72
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:24,370
"So, in 1966, a brave young man
named Seymour Skinner...

73
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,206
enlisted and shipped
and shipped out to Vietnam,

74
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,958
where he rose to become platoon sergeant."

75
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,002
-Ralph.
-Principal Skinner is an old man

76
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,462
who lives at the school.

77
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,089
-Lisa.
-"Sergeant Skinner was a hero.

78
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,468
He risked capture many times
behind enemy lines."

79
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,222
Teacher made me go to Principal
Skinner's office when I was dirty.

80
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,475
"And he survived
to make it back to Springfield

81
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,561
where he became the fine educator
we salute tonight."

82
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:53,358
When I grow up, I wanna be
a principal or a caterpillar.

83
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,276
I love you, Principal Skinner.

84
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,278

-Pull over, driver.

92

Now, I know the school normally
serves cake only on Thursdays.

93

And I'm also well aware
that today is Friday.

94
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,766
Nevertheless, I have a surprise for you.

101
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,871
Oh, thank you. What a wonderful night...

102
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,959
to share with the people
and the town that I love.

103
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:57,046
I have never been happier or prouder
to be Seymour Skinner.

104
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,048
MAN: You're not Seymour Skinner.

105
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,466
(murmuring)

106
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,552
-(gasps) Skinner!
-Skinner?

107
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,639
-I'm Skinner.
-Seymour? (sobs)

108
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,309
-Mother!
-She's my mother!

109
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,768
(murmuring)

110
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,396
Will someone remove
that crazy man, please?

111
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,815
No. No. He's--

112
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,151
He's not crazy. It's true.

113
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,903
I'm-- (sighs)

114
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,782
I-- I'm... an impostor.

115
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:29,871
-That man is the real Seymour Skinner.
-(gasping, murmuring)

116
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,918
(Homer thinking) <i>Keep looking shocked</i>

117
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,005
<i>and move slowly towards the cake.</i>

118
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:47,180
Now, let's clear this up.
Who exactly are you?

119
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,558
Sergeant Seymour Skinner, U.S. Army.

120
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,061
It's true. I was in his platoon.

121
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,230
But they said you were killed
on that scouting mission.

122
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,482
No, just captured.

123
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,984
It's kind of a funny story, really.

124
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,612
After five years in a secret P.O.W. camp,

125
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,989
I was sold to China for slave labor.

126
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,076
And since '77, I've been
making sneakers at gunpoint

127
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,869
in a sweatshop in Wuhan.

128
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,205
That's not a funny story.

129
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,415
Well, I guess you had to be there.

130
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,335
Anyhow, the U.N.
shut the factory down last week

131
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,088
and the embassy shipped
me home, and here I am.

132
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:24,133
So what's your story, Seymour,
if that is your real name?

133
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,052
Well, obviously it isn't.

134
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:29,764
My real name is Armin Tamzarian.

135
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:33,351
-(gasping)
-(laughing)

136
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,312
I'm an orphan from Capitol City,
and those who recall my fight

137
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,689
to outlaw teenage rudeness
may be shocked to learn

138
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,943
that I, myself, was once a street punk.

139
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,448
-(shouts)
-(tires screeching)

140
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,449
-<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>-</i>(siren wailing)

141
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,159
<i>The way I was headed,</i>
<i>it was just a matter of time</i>

142
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,745
<i>before I wound up in front of a judge.</i>

143
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,705
-(yells)
-What the-

144
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,124
(siren stops)

145
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,418
<i>They gave me a choice.</i>

146
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,924
Jail, the army, or apologizing
to the judge and the old lady.

147
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,634
Of course, if I'd known there was a war

148
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,970
going on, I probably would've apologized.

149
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,180
-(men shouting)
-(gunfire)

150
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,522
(groans)

151
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,150
OK, who wants a piece of me?

152
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,151
(grunts)

153
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,279
You trying to get
yourself killed, Tamzarian?

154
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,615
You've got your whole life ahead of you.
Don't you have any dreams?

155
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,784
My dreams all involve combing my hair.

156
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,121
Oh, gosh, son. Everybody's got dreams.

157
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,540
I come from a town called Springfield.

158
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,916
And my dream is to go back

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,377
and become principal
of the elementary school.

160
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,715
Some people might call that
a pretty corny dream, uh, Sergeant.

161
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:50,803
Well, there's nothing corny about
fresh-faced youngsters skipping to school,

162
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,014
scraping knees and spelling bees

163
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:56,851
and pies cooling softly
on the windowsill. (chuckles)

164
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:00,813
Well, sir, if that's corny,
then corn me up.

165
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,274
ARMIN (narrating): <i>Sergeant Skinner</i>
<i>took me under his wing</i>

166
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,401
<i>and showed me that life was worth living.</i>

167
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,238
<i>I came to think of him</i>
<i>as the big brother I never had.</i>

168
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,241
<i>He made me believe</i>
<i>I might have a future after all.</i>

169
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,245
-Come on!
-(gunshots)

170
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,877
ARMIN (narrating): <i>And when they told us</i>
<i>he was missing,</i>

171
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,130
<i>presumed dead, my future died once again.</i>

172
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,050
<i>My life lost all meaning.</i>

173
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,305
Come on! Get to the part
where you steal his identity.

174
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,725
(scoffs) I'm trying to explain
how emotionally fragile I was.

175
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,436
Oh, it's one of those stories.

176
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,521
(clears throat)

177
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,272
Sergeant Skinner meant the world to me.

178
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,735
<i>And I--I felt it was my duty</i>
<i>to deliver the grim news to his mother.</i>

179
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,494
(clears throat)

180
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,789
Hello. I'm, uh-- I'm--

181
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,042
Seymour, is that you?

182
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,461
ARMIN (narrating): <i>I don't know why I did</i>
<i>what I did.</i>

183
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,130
<i>I guess I couldn't bear</i>
<i>to tell her about her son.</i>

184
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:12,051
<i>What I did was wrong,</i>
<i>but... I'd do it again.</i>

185
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,554
Yes, Mother, it's me.

186
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,974
You look different somehow.

187
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:22,061
But you must be Seymour.
Yes. You are Seymour.

188
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,189
ARMIN (narrating):
<i>As strange as it sounds,</i>

189
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,233
<i>deep down, I think she knew</i>
<i>I wasn't her son,</i>

190
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:31,571
<i>but the lie made us both happier</i>
<i>than the truth ever could have.</i>

191
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:36,158
You can have some lima beans
as soon as you've cleaned your room.

192
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,787
Go! Upstairs, third door on the left.

193
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,746
(running)

194
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,540
Don't walk on the rugs!

195
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,166
Yes, Mother.

196
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,838
Don't judge her too harshly, Sergeant.
She was a lonely old woman.

197
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,758
If you must blame someone, blame me.

198
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,387
Well, that's pretty much
what I was planning to do there, Armin.

199
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,265
Well, that's about it.
And so, for the past 26 years,

200
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,935
I've dedicated myself
to living out your dream.

201
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,062
I didn't dream anything about an aqua suit

202
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,441
or a lavender shirt,
but you did take care of Mom.

203
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,861
A dagger! A dagger through my heart!

204
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,614
-Oh, here, Mother. Let me help you.
-Get your hands off me!

205
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,824
-Please, Mom.
-You too, stranger!

206
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:20,286
-I'm your son.
-I have no son.

207
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,623
Look, lady, you obviously
have at least one son.

208
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:28,044
No! I have one stranger and one fraud.

209
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,380
-Take it easy, Mom.
-I said, back off!

210
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,591
You better do as she says.
She's quick with a hatpin.

211
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,554
(sighs) Uh, well, hey, I suppose
I'll have to find a hotel.

212
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,683
I won't hear of it. Tonight you can sleep
on the floor of your office.

213
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,646
(whistling) Hey, Armin.

214
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,565
(muttering, clears throat)

215
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,816
Miss Krabappel sent me.

216
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,902
I forged my dad's signature
on my report card.

217
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,321
Oh, now, Bart, you know that's wrong.

218
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,615
I don't see how me signing
Homer's name is any different

219
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,325
from you using Sergeant Skinner's name.

220
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:03,537
(sighs) I guess me punishing you
would be somewhat hypocritical.

221
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,040
Why don't you just write a 30-word essay
on what you've done?

222
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,459
Hey, hey, hey.
Easy there, you big impostor.

223
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,005
(beeping)

224
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,966
So, uh, um,
should I sign my original name?

225
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,470
Just put an "X," then call yourself
whatever the hell you want.

226
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,514
Well, now, there's no need for profanity.

227
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,556
My name may have changed,

228
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,934
but I'm still the same man
I was last week.

229
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,603
Not to us you're not.
I mean, how would you feel

230
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,648
if you suddenly found out
Ned Flanders was an impostor?

231
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,859
-Who's Ned Flanders?
-My next-door neighbor. Religious guy?

232
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,363
-Oh, you mean Reverend Lovejoy.
-No, I don't!

233
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,825
What I mean is, to me
you're just a stranger

234
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:44,036
-pretending to be something he's not.
-Mmm.

235
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,789
Oh, I'm sorry, but that's just how I feel.

236
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:51,961
No, don't apologize.
It's time I stopped pretending.

237
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:56,632
I've called this assembly
to announce my retirement

238
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,260
effective as of the end of this sentence.

239
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,933
This sentence I'm speaking... right now.

240
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:11,522
-Period.
-(gasping, murmuring)

241
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:15,192
I wrongfully usurped
Sergeant Skinner's position

242
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,195
and I suggest you consider him
to replace me.

243
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,280
Thank you.

244
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,740
Well, now, I don't know.

245
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,534
Skinner, do you know anything
about being a principal?

246
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,953
Well, it's been my lifelong ambition.

247
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,789
And if a man pretending
to be me could do it,

248
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,168
well, then, logically, the real me must be
far more qualified.

249
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,169
Good enough.

250
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,464
Armin Tamzarian's reign of terror is over.

251
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,801
Now let us welcome our new
Principal Skinner,

252
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,178
Principal Seymour Skinner.

253
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,640
-Uh, him.
-(cheering)

254
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,904
Well, before I go, I've got some
personal items for you.

255
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,782
You belong to the Radio Shack
Battery Club.

256
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,450
Oh, oh, 10 Canadian dollars.

257
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,161
That's a souvenir from your trip to
Upstate New York.

258
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:10,414
(chuckles) You've led quite a life,
Tamzarian.

259
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:14,460
It's your life.
I just kept it warm for you.

260
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,671
Oh, I nearly forgot. Your pocket watch.

261
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,049
-Mother's picture is still inside.
-(ticking)

262
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,091
Take good care of her.

263
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,761
I'll wind her every day.

264
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:30,226
I poached some fish
for your trip, Mr. Tamzarian.

265
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,521
They're full of tiny bones,
so I want you to be careful.

266
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:38,609
I will, Moth-- uh, Mrs. Skinner. (sighs)

267
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,944
Well, I'd better be going.

268
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,116
(sighs)

269
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,117
(knocks on door)

270
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:53,332
Good evening, Edna. I know we were
planning to see a film tonight,

271
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,417
but instead, I'm leaving town forever.

272
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,671
No, please. I don't care what you've done.

273
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,006
You're still a decent, honorable man.

274
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,800
Mmm.

275
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,261
That's the kind of talk
that makes me want to marry you.

276
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,387
Oh!

277
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,848
But instead, I'm leaving town forever.

278
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,891
-Good-bye.
-Mmm.

279
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,949
Well, it's time to pick up
where I left off--

280
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,243
as a no-good street punk.

281
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,290
(engine starts)

282
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,460
Principal Skinner?

283
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,254
Up yours, children.

284
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,262
(laughs) Now, to recap
our top story in its entirety.

285
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,098
"The adaptable citizens of Springfield
have opened their hearts

286
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,434
to Principal Seymour Skinner, who--"

287
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,644
Not that one.

288
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,272
Idiots.

289
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,274
(cheering)

290
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:04,486
Thank you. Thank you.
I must say, in many ways...

291
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,448
Springfield really beats
the old slave-labor camp.

292
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,700
(cheering)

293
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,370
I admit Sergeant Skinner seems OK.

294
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,290
But Mr. Tamzarian pulled himself up
from the streets

295
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,626
and earned our respect and admiration.

296
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,545
-He lied about his name.
-His name doesn't matter.

297
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,423
"A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet."

298
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,134
-Not if you called 'em stench blossoms.
-Or crap weeds.

299
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,262
I'd sure hate to get a dozen
crap weeds for Valentine's Day.

300
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,432
-I'd rather have candy.
-Not if they were called scum drops.

301
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,644
Your new principal
would like to say a few words.

302
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,271
Remember, you have to respect him.

303
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,774
-He's a war hero.
-Ha-ha!

304
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,692
Thank you, Chalmers.

305
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,654
You know where I come from,
there's no better way to get acquainted

306
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,823
than by reciting the Pledge
of Allegiance together.

307
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,036
Why don't you lead us, son?

308
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,039
[spoken lyrics]
Hey, America you're so fine.

309
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,958
You're so fine, you blow my mind, America.

310
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,960
-(armpit fart)
-(laughter)

311
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,712
Well, that's very concise,

312
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,799
but it's an insult
to everything I suffered for.

313
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,343
Now, take a seat, junior,
and listen to someone

314
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,429
who gave their youth
in service of their country.

315
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,557
Mrs. Krabappel, the pledge, please.

316
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,561
You haven't dealt with women
for a long time, have you, Sergeant?

317
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,606
Are you asking me out?

318
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,941
(siren wailing)

319
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,402
Ah, 433rd Street.

320
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,945
My old neighborhood.

321
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,488
-(music playing)
-Hmm.

322
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,577
"Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

323
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,830
Capitol City's nakedest ladies.

324
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,749
They're not even wearing a smile.

325
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,044
Nod suggestively. Yes, six. Count 'em.

326
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,797
Six gorgeous ladies just dying...

327
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,133
for your leers and catcalls.

328
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,801
Yowza, yowza."

329
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,469
(groans)

330
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,723
Seymour, it's 7:30. Where were you?

331
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,226
-A bar, Mom.
-I don't know what that is

332
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,354
but on Fridays, you come
straight home after school!

333
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,857
Tonight is silhouette night. Sit there.

334
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,526
I really just came home
to change into a turtleneck.

335
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,528
Seymour, sit!

336
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,198
In the morning. Oh, Mom,
I'm borrowing your car.

337
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,667
-Good morning, Agnes.
-Mmm.

338
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,754
Mmm, how's your new son working out?

339
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,339
That child is the most disobedient,

340
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,342
smart-alecky, middle-aged man in creation!

341
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,385
Hello, ladies.

342
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,971
Is this the line for people
who wanna bad-mouth Sergeant Skinner?

343
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,850
-And have 10 items or less.
-Twelve, 11, 10. The man's a weenie.

344
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,520
Oh, now, be fair, Edna.
I liked Armin Tamzarian, too...

345
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,273
but he was at least as big a weenie
as Sergeant Skinner.

346
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,985
-But he was our weenie.
-Now, there was a weenie...

347
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,280
you could be proud to call your son.

348
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,907
Did you ever tell him that?

349
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,201
Hmm.

350
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:01,288
OK, once more, where are we going?

351
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,539
To Capitol City.

352
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,500
And why are you
and the old lady in the car?

353
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,586
We're gonna talk Armin Tamzarian
into coming back.

354
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,756
-And why is Marge here?
-I came up with the idea.

355
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,509
-And why am I here?
-Because the streets of Capitol City

356
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,303
are no place for three unescorted ladies.

357
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,638
And why are the kids here?

358
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,848
Because we couldn't find Grampa
to sit for them.

359
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,350
And why is Grampa here?

360
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,228
'Cause Jasper
didn't wanna come by himself.

361
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,274
-(chuckles) Fair enough.
-Hello, beautiful!

362
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,861
-In your dreams.
-We'll see about that.

363
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,864
(snoring)

364
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,994
Hello, beautiful. (snoring resumes)

365
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:47,417
My mind is made up. I'm not coming back,
and that's final.

366
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,506
-Oh, Seymour.
-And I'm not Seymour.

367
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,883
My name is Armin.
This is Armin's apartment,

368
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:59,054
Armin's liquor, Armin's
copy of <i>Swank, </i>Armin's frozen peas.

369
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,807
-Can I see your copy of <i>Swank, </i>Armin?
-Yes, you can.

370
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,808
This is Armin's life.

371
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,727
And maybe it's not perfect,
but at least I'm back where I belong.

372
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,480
I was born a no-goodnik,
and I'll die a no-goodnik.

373
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,025
Seymour! I didn't bring you up
to use language like that!

374
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,736
-Well, you didn't bring me up at all.
-The hell I didn't!

375
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,281
I've been taking care of you for 26 years!

376
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,409
-I'm the only mother you've ever known!
-But you have your real son.

377
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,411
You're my real son!

378
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,413
You've been my son longer than he has.

379
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,040
And he doesn't need me,
and I don't need him!

380
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,459
Now you march yourself
downstairs and get in that car!

381
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,753
-Yes, Mother.
-And the rest of you, too!

382
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,213
ALL: Yes, Mrs. Skinner.

383
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,593
(horn honks)

384
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,684
Hey, everybody, look!
Armin Tamzarian's back!

385
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,103
And he's gonna take over the school again!

386
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,271
(chattering)

387
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,064
Now, hold on.

388
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:55,360
Armin Tamzarian is an unsavory character
who played us all for chumps.

389
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,655
All right, all right. So he's a fraud.

390
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:03,827
I don't care. His mom doesn't care.
Do any of you care?

391
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,246
-Nope, not me.
-I guess not.

392
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,000
You all seem to be forgetting
that I am Seymour Skinner.

393
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,710
This is where I belong.

394
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:15,380
You can't ask me to disappear just because
you like some other guy better.

395
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,591
I gave half my life for you people.

396
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:20,219
Aren't I entitled to a little dignity?

397
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,556
You're, uh-- You're right, Sergeant.

398
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,892
Well, I don't see any way out of this.

399
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,394
Now, if you'll allow me,
I think I have a solution

400
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,104
that'll satisfy the town

401
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,441
and let Sergeant Skinner keep his dignity.

402
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,945
-(train horn blowing)
-But I'm a hero!

403
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,364
And we salute you for it.
Now, don't come back.

404
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,074
(cheering)

405
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,076
-I'm sorry, Seymour.
-(marching band)

406
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,577
It's nice you're alive,

407
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,914
but you're just not what I'm looking for
in a son.

408
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,666
I'm glad you understand.

409
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,462
(cheering continues)

410
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,173
Well, this is a lovely gesture, but...

411
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,760
we still have to face the fact
that I'm not really Seymour Skinner.

412
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,680
Oh, no, we don't. Judge Snyder.

413
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,765
By authority of the city of Springfield,

414
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:10,060
I hereby confer upon you
the name of Seymour Skinner...

415
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,813
as well as his past,
present, future and mother.

416
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,982
-OK.
-And I further decree

417
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,109
that everything will be just like it was

418
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,111
before all this happened.

419
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,780
And no one will ever mention it again...

420
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:25,117
under penalty of torture.

421
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,036
(cheering)

422
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,040
-Here, son. This is yours again.
-Mmm.

423
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,544
I've never been happier or prouder
to be Seymour Skinner,

424
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:40,382
but these last few days as that hotheaded
rogue Armin Tamzarian

425
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,592
have taught me a thing or two.

426
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:46,346
You know, maybe I've been a little
too uptight in the past.

427
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,183
Well, from now on, you're gonna see
a new Seymour Skinner.

428
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,894
-Oh, no, we won't!
-Yes, Mother.

429
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,438
(theme music playing)

430
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,442
-(murmuring)
-Shh!

431
