181
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,794
(LAUGHS) You know,

182
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,172
it might be John Barleycorn talking,

183
00:07:54,215 --> 00:07:57,175
but you annoying fleas aren't half bad.

184
00:07:57,218 --> 00:08:00,470
All we're looking for is a
little friendship and respect.

185
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,305
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

186
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,973
To friendship and respect.

187
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:07,393
And also evil. I mean, I mean, football.

188
00:08:07,437 --> 00:08:09,395
ALL: Football!

Ah, whoa, whoa. Sorry, Barn.
Your seat's taken.

191
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,861
Oh, you show up late

192
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:19,822
for your nightly bender just once...

193
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,366
Uh, don't you worry.

194
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:24,786
I just instituted drive-through service.

195
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:27,288

Where is he?

226
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:51,664
I'm supposed to read
him his bedtime story.

227
00:09:53,668 --> 00:09:55,877
Smithers, what are you still doing up?

228
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,463
I was worried about you, sir.

229
00:10:01,618 --> 00:10:02,967
Worried? Eh.

230
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,511
I just had the greatest
night of my life.

231
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:07,930
- With my friends.
- What?

232
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,345
Oh, you should've seen it, Smithers.

233
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,851
They enjoyed my company.

234
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:14,604
I've had "frenemies,"
but they were all French enemies.

235
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,398
Never a friend.

236
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:19,692
I think of you as more
than a friend, sir.

237
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:21,069
What did I tell you about thinking?

238
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:23,479
(SIGHS) Well, did you find anything out?

239
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,073
Any scuttlebutt from the union?

240
00:10:25,116 --> 00:10:28,534
The only union that concerns
me now is the union of men.

241
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:30,495
What would you know about that?

242
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:31,539
(GRUMBLES)

243
00:10:31,623 --> 00:10:32,663
(HOMER HUMMING)

244
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,783
Where have you been? You missed dinner.

245
00:10:35,794 --> 00:10:38,586
There's this really cool
new guy at the plant.

246
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:42,423
You know what's cool is
spending time with your family.

247
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:44,675
- That's not cool.
- Yeah, mom, it really isn't.

248
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:47,845
I agree with mom on everything but this.

249
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,597
I'm sorry. Definitely not cool.

250
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:51,349
Oh, all right, all right.

251
00:10:51,392 --> 00:10:54,477
I just don't trust new
people in this town.

252
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:58,476
Like Lady Gaga?
She came, she inspired Lisa

253
00:10:58,511 --> 00:11:00,441
and we never heard from her again.

254
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:02,443
Who needs friends like that?

255
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:04,436
So, fellows,

256
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:06,614
what's on our social agenda tonight?

257
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:09,408
More galivanting, I hope?

258
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:11,868
Well, we really should do a little work.

259
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:14,530
Yeah.
I have a whole inbox of unsplit atoms

260
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:15,738
I haven't gotten to yet.

261
00:11:15,773 --> 00:11:17,537
Fred, are these men bothering you?

262
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:19,836
- Oh, back off, Smithers.
- ALL: Whoa!

263
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,755
I'll box your ears next time you
speak to me with such insolence.

264
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,915
Yes, sir.

265
00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:26,926
Oh, my god.

266
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,428
You totally pwned him.

267
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:32,311
Hmm. I suppose I did pwn him.

268
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:33,327
I did.

269
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:35,755
Ugh, that was quite the kerfuffle.

270
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,228
I better go take a three-hour nap.

271
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:40,353
No, no, wait. While Smithers
is off drowning his sorrows

272
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:43,067
in a<i> pamplemousse</i> perrier,
Burns is unprotected.

273
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:45,217
This is the perfect time
for you to represent us

274
00:11:45,252 --> 00:11:46,529
and hit the old skinflint up

275
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:47,655
for a decent benefits package.

276
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:49,490
Me, talk to Burns?

277
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:51,284
Oh, I wouldn't. I-I couldn't.

278
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:53,953
He's got the sharpest
mind in all 46 states.

279
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:56,414
Hey, come on, please. For your friends.

280
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,332
I won't let you down.

281
00:11:58,376 --> 00:12:00,668
(ROBOTIC): You down, you down, you down.

282
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,423
I'll help you, friends.

283
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:07,008
FRED VOICE: Don't you understand, Burns?

284
00:12:07,051 --> 00:12:09,302
Without the workers,
this plant is nothing.

285
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:10,636
If you give them respect,

286
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,263
it comes back to you a hundredfold.

287
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:14,640
(CHUCKLES) Respect the workers?

288
00:12:14,684 --> 00:12:18,019
What next?
Put batteries in the smoke detectors?

289
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:20,563
Have you no heart?

290
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,264
I certainly do.

291
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,859
I'm not flooding this room
with mustard gas right now.

292
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:28,446
I'll give you a chance to tell
your buddies that you failed.

293
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:32,742
But then they might not like me anymore.

294
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,786
You're right. Friendship
<i>is</i> something worth treasuring.

295
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,415
Boy, he's really
raking Burns over the coals.

296
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,417
Yeah, I like how they're
not interrupting each other.

297
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,544
- So polite.
- BURNS: Yes, spirits, yes.

298
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:45,630
I'll give them everything they want.

299
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:48,341
- (EXHALES) He said...
- We heard everything.

300
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:50,009
Clearly it was two people talking.

301
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:52,011
We got to spread the good news.

302
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:55,723
We love you, big guy. (GRUNTS)

303
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:58,392
Mr. Burns, what have you done?

304
00:12:58,436 --> 00:13:00,478
There is no Mr. Burns.

305
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:02,313
Only Fred.

306
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:03,522
What are you saying?

307
00:13:04,859 --> 00:13:07,109
Montgomery Burns died
when I put on this suit.

308
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,778
And six other times this week.

309
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,438
Thank god for the new liver and kidneys.

310
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:14,659
Wait up, guys! Beers are on me!

311
00:13:14,702 --> 00:13:16,118
I might have two tonight.

312
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,329
That's right: Two sips!

313
00:13:18,373 --> 00:13:20,498
(LAUGHS)

314
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,293
Hope you're hungry, Homer.

315
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,505
I got up at 2:00 a.m. and
slow-roasted a breakfast turkey.

316
00:13:27,548 --> 00:13:29,674
Sorry, no time for food.
I got to get to work.

317
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:36,097
(SQUEAKING)

318
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,076
When did Homer turn into someone
who wants to go into work?

319
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:40,434
Oh, no. It's in the air.

320
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:43,354
Now I want to go to school
and make something of myself.

321
00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:45,356
Ooh. (BABBLES MUSICALLY)

322
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,441
Hey, work is amazing now.

323
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:51,129
A magical place where we get
what we deserve and more.

324
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,405
And it's all due to Fred.

325
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:55,366
Okay, so when
are we gonna meet this Fred?

326
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,493
Oh, you've already met him, Marge,

327
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,954
