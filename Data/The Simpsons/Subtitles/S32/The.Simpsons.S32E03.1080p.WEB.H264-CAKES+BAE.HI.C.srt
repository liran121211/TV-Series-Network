smiling ear to ear,

359
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,058
not a care in the world.

360
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:37,561
That's not who I am, Diego!

361
00:16:37,754 --> 00:16:39,586
I love you, too.

362
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:41,214
Going to the bar!

363
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,909
Paint. Paint your misery.

364
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:47,670
Also, leave. Leave your husband.

365
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:49,689
Which one of you is the angel?

366
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:50,865
- We both are.
- We both are.

367
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,767
That's how mad you're feeling.

368
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:54,085
Oh.

369
00:16:54,145 --> 00:16:56,488
Back to Heaven!

370
00:16:56,489 --> 00:16:57,489
_

371
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,092
<i>Buenas noches,</i> darling.

372
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:03,018
What a crazy night I had.

373
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:06,188
Now we got to get our
stories straight about Zeppo.

374
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,357
It was an accident, okay?

375
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:09,784
(HONKS)

376
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:11,378
Ah...

377
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:13,271
Starting a new painting?

378
00:17:13,373 --> 00:17:16,699
Yes. I am painting my feelings.

379
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,701
Oh! Oh!

380
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,388
Wow. So strong, so brave,

381
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:23,205
so true to herself.

382
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:25,558
- Mm...
- (GROANS)

383
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:28,061
My darling,
I am not half the artist you are.

384
00:17:28,254 --> 00:17:30,713
Diego, what are you saying?

385
00:17:30,732 --> 00:17:33,958
I am saying I've underestimated
you all this time.

386
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:35,235
You are a genius!

387
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:38,071
From now on, I will show my awe of you

388
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:39,572
by sleeping with other women.

389
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,466
Starting an hour ago.

390
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:44,469
And I will sleep with other
women starting two hours ago.

391
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:47,247
I'm so glad I don't hear what you say.

392
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:51,159
But I will do something I have
not done in our entire marriage:

393
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:52,735
what<i> you</i> want.

394
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,237
Well, actions speak louder than words.

395
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:58,425
No. Unless the action is the
demolition of a big building,

396
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:00,168
words are usually louder.

397
00:18:00,262 --> 00:18:01,986
Everything is a fight.

398
00:18:02,046 --> 00:18:03,821
I completely disagree.

399
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,748
But just wait till you see what I do.

400
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:07,917
You'll be pleased with what I do not do,

401
00:18:07,936 --> 00:18:09,994
and you will love what I do do.

402
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:11,112
Good night!

403
00:18:11,148 --> 00:18:13,088
(GRUMBLES)

404
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,349
Welcome to Rockefeller Center,

405
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:16,834
a temple of capitalism.

406
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,503
To find a taller building,

407
00:18:18,605 --> 00:18:20,763
you'd have to walk a full seven blocks.

408
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:22,356
(CHUCKLES): Long blocks.

409
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:24,099
With people bumping you.

410
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:27,495
Enough already.
While the art is still deco, okay?

411
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,940
For you, my darling.

412
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:33,334
<i>Man at the Crossroads.</i>

413
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:35,870
Rich people. Yes, excellent.

414
00:18:35,964 --> 00:18:38,372
The cosmos. Yes, makes sense.

415
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:39,632
A worker.

416
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:41,526
Well, I suppose it couldn't be helped.

417
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:42,785
Fascist army.

418
00:18:42,846 --> 00:18:45,138
Always welcome in any lobby.

419
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:47,307
Hmm. Who's that fellow?

420
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,535
With the beard and the Bolshevik smile.

421
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:54,055
That is the founder
of Soviet Russia, Lenin.

422
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:55,815
But-but-but he's a communist.

423
00:18:56,008 --> 00:18:58,209
Oh, he just attended
a couple of meetings.

424
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:01,379
I can't have a communist
in my colossus of capitalism.

425
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:02,471
Paint over it.

426
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:03,715
No!

427
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,307
Then you will lose your commission,

428
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:07,911
and I won't let you be
the model for Atlas.

429
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:10,404
Hmm...

430
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:11,981
I don't care.

431
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:14,892
There is one person
I want to be proud of me,

432
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,002
no matter what.

433
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:18,654
(GASPS) Oh, my darling.

434
00:19:18,715 --> 00:19:21,249
Release the hounds.

435
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:22,675
(BARKING IN DISTANCE)

436
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:24,660
They're on the 66th floor, sir.

437
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:27,405
They should be here in about 25 minutes.

438
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:29,432
(BARKING CONTINUES)

439
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,594
But-but-but why is it
just sitting there?

440
00:19:33,747 --> 00:19:35,188
I, uh... I think they may be eating

441
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:37,023
the elevator operator, sir.

442
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:38,766
Let us leave, my darling,

443
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,085
with our scruples intact.

444
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:42,511
Push the owner's button.

445
00:19:42,572 --> 00:19:44,605
- But...
- I said push it.

446
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:46,032
Aah!

447
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:49,410
Ironically, in time,

448
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:51,854
Frida became more famous than Diego,

449
00:19:51,915 --> 00:19:55,616
an icon for brilliant
female artists everywhere.

450
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,378
