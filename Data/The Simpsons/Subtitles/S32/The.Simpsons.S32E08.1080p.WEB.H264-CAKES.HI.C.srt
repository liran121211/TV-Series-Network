00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:14,161
Well, I see
that not one of your students

4
00:00:14,173 --> 00:00:17,040
was able to meet the
national fitness standards:

5
00:00:17,134 --> 00:00:18,449
a light jog.

- (MOANS SOFTLY)
- Come on, Duggins.

7
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,378
You got to be a role
model for those lazy kids.

8
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:25,381

hours a day stretching...

Oh, my goodness.
Thank you, Principal Finch.

14
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:41,047
Well, I guess we can cross
"hilarious joke" off the agenda.

15
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,066
Oh, I-I've also got a funny thing.

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,219
(CHUCKLES) Duggins' wife was unfaithful.

- Sorry, Duggins.
- Screw you.

20
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:57,063
Indeed. Now, as you all know,
this weekend in Cincinnati

21
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,233
is the national
administrator's convention,

22
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,676
or EDU-CON.

23
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:04,571
And, uh, well, I have been invited

24
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:06,573

I agree.

Yes, well, as you all know,

33
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:27,351
the budget allows for a plus-one,

34
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:29,037
and I was thinking I would bring

35
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:32,282
the principal with the
highest test scores,

36
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:34,734
- Finch.
- Well, that's not fair.

37
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,212
Finch runs the magnet school
for gifted test takers.

38
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:40,364
Uh, sorry, Seymour,
but I have made my decision.

39

If it makes you feel any better,
you were never in the running.

40

Hey, we are gonna light Cincinnati up.

41

that he's firing salmon
eggs from both ends.

90
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,074

You want to come with me to Cincinnat...
No. Thank you.

Very thoughtful, Seymour,
but I-I wouldn't want to...
