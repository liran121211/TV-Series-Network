00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:03,918
SURGEON FIANCE: Mary?

355
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,253
So this is why you
didn't answer my calls.

356
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:07,922
No! It's not what it looks like!

357
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:10,349
He's just the gazebo builder.

358
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:16,580
You took my room from me, movie lady.

359
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:19,192
And now it's payback time.

360
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,195
Hey, everybody! Want to see
what this Heartmark phony

361
00:16:22,363 --> 00:16:24,071
really thinks of you?

362
00:16:27,035 --> 00:16:28,108
My footage!

363
00:16:29,045 --> 00:16:30,048
<i>Oh. Yeah.</i>

364
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,206
<i>I'm surrounded by a bunch of backwoods,
lotto-scratching,</i>

00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,540

366
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:36,191

(GASPING)

368
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:40,438
But we opened our hearts to you.

369
00:16:40,456 --> 00:16:42,882
I let myself be whimsical
in front of you!

370
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:46,535
How dare you not be charmed by us.

371
00:16:46,596 --> 00:16:48,095
(STOMACH GURGLES)

372
00:16:50,558 --> 00:16:52,892
I may drive a monster truck,

373
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:56,062
but the real monster is she!

374
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:02,025
Wait! I didn't mean it!

375
00:17:02,094 --> 00:17:04,344
And we know all about
your plans to sell the town

376
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,589
to that big developer who
wants to turn it into condos.

377
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,184
No, I'm not. How would I sell the town?

378
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:11,669
Yeah, all right. Forget I said anything.

379
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:13,187
I took a shot. I whiffed it.

380
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,429
Let's just... move on.

381
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:15,948
Mary, you got to do something.

382
00:17:16,141 --> 00:17:18,617
Without these Big Gulp-guzzling
bumpkins as extras,

383
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,511
we can't finish the movie.

384
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:22,179
Come back, everyone!

385
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:23,747
Come back.

386
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:29,462
I love it when a shoot falls apart.

387
00:17:36,587 --> 00:17:38,804
I was sent here to put<i> out</i> fires.

388
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:44,218
How could you say those hurtful
things about Springfield?

389
00:17:44,312 --> 00:17:47,796
I'm sorry, but working on
this movie's been so painful.

390
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:51,058
For me, Christmas is the least
wonderful time of the year.

391
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:52,710
But the song says "the most."

392
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,695
I know what the song says!

393
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:59,658
There's a reason I
hate Christmas movies.

394
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:04,663
It all started one winter,

395
00:18:04,856 --> 00:18:06,740
when a movie production came to town.

396
00:18:06,892 --> 00:18:09,335
My dad thought it'd
be fun to be an extra.

397
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:11,562
They cast him as a store employee

398
00:18:11,664 --> 00:18:13,822
in a scene where crazed
parents stormed in

399
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:15,657
to get the hottest toy.

400
00:18:15,718 --> 00:18:17,325
He was trampled to death.

401
00:18:17,428 --> 00:18:19,327
You can still see his
last moments on Earth

402
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:21,496
in the trailer for... (SOBS)

403
00:18:21,557 --> 00:18:24,165
<i>Jingle All the Way.</i>

(CRIES) And now I've lost everything,

406
00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:30,022
my fiancé, my dream job

407
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:31,357
and, worst of all,

408
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:33,600
the respect of a small town.

409
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:36,270
Then you<i> do</i> like Springfield.

410
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:37,771
I've come to love this place,

411
00:18:37,865 --> 00:18:39,590
with its homespun ways,

412
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:41,200
its earnest, hardworking folk

413
00:18:41,393 --> 00:18:43,944
and its wonderful airbed-and-breakfasts.

414
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:45,445
I guess what I'm saying is,

415
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,665
I'm really gonna miss you all.

416
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:53,546
Airport, please.

417
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:54,788
Right away.

418
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:56,882
I just got to make one quick stop.

419
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:01,945
MARY: The simple townsfolk
are rebuilding the set!

420
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:03,722
It's a miracle!

421
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:07,375
We're gonna be able to finish
this piece of crap after all.

422
00:19:07,478 --> 00:19:09,620
(LAUGHING)

423
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,671
You. But how?

424
00:19:11,732 --> 00:19:14,900
I gave a rousing speech about
how our Gulps might be big

425
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:16,794
and our trucks might be monster

426
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:19,313
but our hearts are enlarged as well.

427
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:22,816
And I secretly filmed you
saying nice things to my mom.

428
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,411
And I showed the whole town.

429
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:28,581
Yeah, and we saw that was
the real youse. (CHUCKLES)

430
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:30,398
(CHEERING)

431
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:32,751
Thank you for showing me
that small towns

432
00:19:32,903 --> 00:19:34,587
are the best-sized towns of all

433
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,256
and Christmas movies
are the best movies,

434
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:39,091
because everything always works out,

435
00:19:39,284 --> 00:19:41,093
no matter how contrived.

436
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:43,429
Now let's finish this movie.

437
00:19:43,622 --> 00:19:44,930
(CHEERING)

438
00:19:45,123 --> 00:19:46,432
Mary, wait, I...

439
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,933
I don't know what
happened in that gazebo,

440
00:19:48,126 --> 00:19:49,201
but I don't care!

441
00:19:49,294 --> 00:19:50,418
So who's it gonna be,

442
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:51,895
me or him?

443
00:19:53,774 --> 00:19:55,441
Darling, you're perfect.

444
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:58,018
But maybe life isn't about perfect.

445
00:19:58,112 --> 00:20:00,261
Skinner...
I don't know your first name...

446
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:02,764
you're the one who remembered
how I like my coffee,

447
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:04,950
and that's why I choose you.

448
00:20:05,143 --> 00:20:06,619
ALL: Aw!

449
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:09,771
Are you nuts? Pick him!

450
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,365
He's a thousand times better than me.

451
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,699
He's a surgeon.

452
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:14,627
A handsome surgeon.

453
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,869
What was your plan?

454
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:17,278
Were you gonna move here?

455
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:18,964
Were we gonna share a car?

456
00:20:19,116 --> 00:20:22,259
I'm getting dizzy just thinking
about your poor decision-making.

457

This is twice now.

I don't care!
