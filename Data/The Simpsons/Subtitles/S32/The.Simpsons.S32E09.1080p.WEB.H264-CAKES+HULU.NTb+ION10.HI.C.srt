Lisa, you just gotta be sincere.

356

If you have a disagreement
with another driver,

357
00:16:31,385 --> 00:16:34,569
you simply say, "I'm sorry.
Please go ahead."

Then you follow 'em home

that the Lady Gaga<i> Star is

I'm sorry I made your life harder,

and I hope this chair makes it easier.

Well, I don't accept your apology.

- What?
- What am I supposed to do

393
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:10,089
after you called me a hack?

394
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,425
In retrospect, I might have been wrong.

395

414

and no offense,
but I bought you a chair.

- All is forgiven.
- How forgiven?
