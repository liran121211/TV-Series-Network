Homer Simpson, you don't
like steak anymore?

Actually, I've become a bit of a me-gan.

362
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:15,836
Do you have any spaghetti
with my-balls? Uh, meatballs?

"Me-gan? My-balls?"

364
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:20,274
Are you eating forbidden fruit?

365
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:22,376
Fruit? Ugh.

366
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:27,248
Sorry, Flanders,

367
00:16:27,283 --> 00:16:30,751
but I've got more delicious
meat in my little finger

Elegant? With your waistline?

I don't think so.
