What about learning?

No longer part of our mandate.

a mother word about her.

115
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,888
Aw, please tell me what's wrong.

116
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,891
I can't tell you.
You just have to know.

117
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,261
- Would tickling help matters?
- No.

118
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,296
Well, that's really
all I have in my toolbox.

119
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,232
Okay, let me think.
What's today? Tuesday?

Yes.

00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:42,386
I don't want to.
I'm bigger than teacher.

181
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:44,987
I broke my desk.
Teacher cry.

182
00:07:45,023 --> 00:07:48,261
I'm growing a mustache
under my long nose.

183
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:53,466
(grunts)
Better use Mom's closet.

184
00:07:55,734 --> 00:07:58,571
Oof. It's full?

185
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:05,174
Read me. Read me.

186
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,410
Come on, help a letter out.

187
00:08:06,446 --> 00:08:08,912
(moans)

188
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:10,246
"Dear Homer,

189
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,181
By the time you read this..."

190
00:08:12,217 --> 00:08:13,350
MARGE: <i>I will be gone.</i>

191
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:15,551
<i>Since we married,
you've changed.</i>

192
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:17,287
<i>Not once for the better.</i>

193
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:19,355
What's it say? I can't read.

194
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:21,859
MARGE: <i>So I'm taking
the kids and opening</i>

195
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:23,426
<i>a bed-and-breakfast.</i>

196
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,465
(speaking German)

197
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,433
MARGE:
<i>Bitterly, Marge.</i>

198
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:30,434
(gasps)

199
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,106
Is Mom really leaving Dad?

200
00:08:36,109 --> 00:08:38,375
(gasps)

201
00:08:38,411 --> 00:08:40,910
So, you finally left him.

202
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:43,713
Well, good for me
and good for you.

203
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:47,217
I finally learned how
to unhook a bra with one hand.

204
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:49,486
MARGE:
Lisa, I know what you're doing.

205
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:50,523
(gasps)

206
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:54,558
You're hiding when you're
supposed to help me

207
00:08:54,594 --> 00:08:55,925
give the dog a bath.

208
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:58,562
Mom, Mom!
(whimpers)

209
00:08:58,598 --> 00:09:01,497
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I'm not going anywhere.

210
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:03,333
Oh, God bless you, inertia.

211
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:05,973
- Not until I wash this dog.
- (burps)

212
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,173
(whispers):
Bart, Mom's leaving Dad.

213
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:10,439
Oh, the poor guy.

214
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:12,976
Please let me tell him, please.

215
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:14,178
BART:
<i>Pass the gravy.</i>

216
00:09:14,214 --> 00:09:17,514
We used to call it "grave,"
but that was too scary.

217
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,950
So we modified it to "gravy,"
unless it had meat chunks.

218
00:09:20,986 --> 00:09:25,588
In which case, it was "gravier,"
but the war changed everything.

219
00:09:25,624 --> 00:09:27,591
Ugh.

220
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:30,928
I wish you wouldn't drink
so much in front of the kids.

221
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:33,597
Marge, I tried to drink
in the pantry,

222
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:35,933
but you claim
that's antisocial.

223
00:09:35,969 --> 00:09:38,267
Ugh. Why don't you
just go to Moe's?

224
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,171
You want me to go to a bar
on my daughter's birthday?

225
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,373
That is so messed up.

226
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:47,443
I'm going, of course,
but it is so messed up.

227
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:48,612
Happy birthday.

228
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:49,612
(door slams)

229
00:09:49,648 --> 00:09:50,613
(Marge groans)

230
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:52,652
(crying quietly)

231
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:58,191
Harvard will save me.
Harvard will save me.

232
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:04,227
Kiss me, Lisa, in front of
the hall my grandfather endowed.

233
00:10:04,263 --> 00:10:08,799
He made his money in opium,
but we said it was molasses.

234
00:10:08,835 --> 00:10:10,400
(Marge crying)

235
00:10:10,436 --> 00:10:12,501
First, I have to save
my parents' marriage.

236
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:14,237
Wait here in this fantasy?

237
00:10:14,273 --> 00:10:17,341
Yeah, can we, um, you know,
see other people?

238
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:18,378
Sure.

239
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,315
(Marge crying)

240
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:29,252
(crying continues)

241
00:10:29,288 --> 00:10:30,820
(electrical crackling)

242
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:32,358
(bell jingles)

243
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,593
Man, Moe, you sure are spry.

244
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:40,100
(stammers)
The job keeps me young, eh.

245
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:47,570
Dad! Mom is gonna leave you.

246
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:50,406
Sweetie, marriages
are like water heaters...

247
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,174
they sit peacefully for years

248
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,246
until they explode in a fireball
ruining everything you own.

249
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:57,747
Mom packed her bags.

250
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:00,416
Which suitcase?
The one with the broken wheel?

251
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,020
Because she won't get more than
a block away with that.

252
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:04,353
She fixed the wheel.

253
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:05,554
Oh, God!

254
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,256
(crying)

255
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,892
- Dad, you've got to shape up.
- Hmm?

256
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:11,461
I'm 14-years-old.

257
00:11:11,497 --> 00:11:14,298
These next four years
are the last memories I'll have

258
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:16,098
of all of us together.

259
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,601
I'll do anything
you say, sweetie.

260
00:11:17,637 --> 00:11:19,636
I want you to stop drinking.

261
00:11:19,672 --> 00:11:20,904
Stop drinking?

262
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,807
But that's like asking a golfer
to stop drinking.

263
00:11:23,843 --> 00:11:24,708
(moans)

264
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:26,142
I never thought I'd say this,

265
00:11:26,178 --> 00:11:28,211
but I'd better text my sponsor.

266
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:29,612
Homer's got a sponsor?

267
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,482
Uh, what idiot would lean
into <i>that</i> buzz saw?

268
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:35,251
Hey, hey!
I'm the man from A-diddly-A!

269
00:11:35,287 --> 00:11:37,654
Ned, I have
to quit drinking. Now!

270
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,589
All right, soberino,
it's just 12 simple steps.

271
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,159
Oh, <i>12?</i>

272
00:11:42,195 --> 00:11:43,260
Fine. Nine.

273
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:44,828
Oh!

274
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:47,164
Okay, step one:
Admit you're powerless.

275
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,299
I'm powerless.
Boom! Done.

276
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:52,836
Step two: Admit there is a power
greater than yourself.

277
00:11:52,872 --> 00:11:56,238
Um, if I'm powerless, isn't
every power greater than myself?

278
00:11:56,274 --> 00:11:58,507
This is the 12 steps,
not 20 questions.

279
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:01,511
Now, make a decision
to turn your life to God.

280
00:12:01,547 --> 00:12:05,247
(scoffs) God. He's in every
deal, like undercoating. Fine.

281
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:07,416
Make a searching
moral inventory of yourself.

282
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:11,254
If I have one tiny flaw, it's
that I have many enormous flaws.

283
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,756
Admit the nature of your wrongs.

284
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:15,424
Well, I'm not
the best parallel parker.

285
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,929
Are you ready for God
to remove these defects?

286
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:20,863
Dear Lord, the Satan of Heaven,

287
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:22,765
I order you to fix me.

288
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:24,467
Okay, I'm just gonna
fast-forward through this.

289
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:25,935
- Make amends.
- Here's your wallet.

290
00:12:25,971 --> 00:12:27,838
- Engage in prayer.
- I pray you're not mad.

291
00:12:27,874 --> 00:12:29,909
And have a spiritual awakening.

292
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,776
(gasps)
Things that cost $9.99

293
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:36,313
are really ten dollars!

294
00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:39,315
The Lord has spoken,
and it is good!

295
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:41,217
That's it.
No more drinking.

296
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:43,453
(clicking tongue)
Look at those, guys.

297
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:45,521
I used to be like them.

298
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,457
(laughs):
Oh, I'm overjoyed for thee.

299
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:50,293
Call me anytime you hear
the devil's seductive voice.

300
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:51,727
MOE:
Homer?

301
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:53,163
(singsongy):
Homer...

302
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:55,664
(deeper):
Homer...

303
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,302
(deep, distorted):
How's about a Flaming Moe?

304
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:00,837
(chuckles evilly)

305
00:13:00,873 --> 00:13:02,572
Drink me!

306
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:06,342
I'm the most overpriced thing
at Universal Studios!

307
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:08,382
No! I won't do it!

308
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:16,086
Lisa, sweetie,
let's celebrate your birthday!

309
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:17,254
Yes!

310
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,021
HOMER:
<i>Ah, honey.</i>

311
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:20,256
- (moaning)
- I'm so sorry.

312
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:21,861
I miss you so much.

313
00:13:23,229 --> 00:13:25,828
LISA:
<i>He</i> did <i>quit, for good,</i>

314
00:13:25,864 --> 00:13:29,533
<i>and it was the best
birthday present I ever got.</i>

315
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:32,102
Well, the essay <i>is</i> pretty trite.

316
00:13:32,138 --> 00:13:34,938
But her grades are perfect,
her extracurricular's stellar,

317
00:13:34,974 --> 00:13:37,573
and she'll be the first
from her state, ever.

318
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,910
Admit! And now
for our instantaneous letter

319
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:41,511
of acceptance.

320
00:13:41,547 --> 00:13:44,347
(whirring)

321
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:45,381
(fanfare plays)

322
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:48,821
(gasps)
I'm in! And I accept!

323
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,141
(gasps, groans)

324
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:08,189
I'm here! And it's Ivy-er
than my Ivy-est dreams.

325
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:10,585
- Lisa Simpson.
- Lisa Simpson?

326
00:14:10,621 --> 00:14:13,627
Hmm, I'm sorry,
but there must be some mistake.

327
00:14:13,663 --> 00:14:15,796
- Oh, no!
- Ha! Gotcha!

328
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:17,799
My one moment of superiority

329
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:20,468
before a lifetime
of begging you for money.

330
00:14:20,504 --> 00:14:21,973
(tires squeal)

331
00:14:24,575 --> 00:14:25,910
(tires screech)

332
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,877
Come on, sweetie, let me
carry you over the threshold.

333
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:33,281
(laughs)
Dad! That's for weddings.

334
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:35,049
I think Dad's
turning into Grampa.

335
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:36,284
Hey, I don't need

336
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,051
(like Grampa):
to listen to that hooey!

337
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:40,655
Because I make tie clips
out of maple syrup,

338
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:43,424
but only for Flag Day!

339
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,260
♪ By the sea, by the sea ♪

340
00:14:45,296 --> 00:14:47,228
♪ By the beautiful sea... ♪

341
00:14:47,264 --> 00:14:50,297
This is great... we don't have
to visit Grampa anymore.

342
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,636
(whirring, beeping)

343
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,809
(robotic voice):
Chug, chug, chug.

344
00:15:00,845 --> 00:15:03,178
(slurring):
Really, man, I've had enough.

345
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:06,680
(robotic voice): The hazing
ends when we say it ends.

346
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:08,816
Do you need any help unpacking?

347
00:15:08,852 --> 00:15:12,189
Mom, I need to learn
to do these things for myself.

348
00:15:13,224 --> 00:15:15,225
(whirring, clicking)

349
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:19,761
Sorry, friend,

350
00:15:19,797 --> 00:15:22,033
you can't pahk your cah
in Hahvahd Yahd.

351
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:25,967
I can't what my what

(gasps) My roommate.

359
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:41,983
So, you play an instrument?

360
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:43,617
Bari sax.

361
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:46,387
- Are you good?
- I played at Kenny G's funeral.

362
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:48,555
<i>Ooh, she's pretty impressive.</i>

363
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:51,659
Uh... any childhood heartbreak?

364
00:15:51,695 --> 00:15:54,061

it's that <i>you</i> belong here.

385
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,839
You're gonna study harder,

386
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,574
you're gonna ask
better questions,

387
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,876
you're gonna get into

388
