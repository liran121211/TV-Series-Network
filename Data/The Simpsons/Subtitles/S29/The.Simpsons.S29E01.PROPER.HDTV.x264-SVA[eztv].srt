1
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:34,879
Water a soup again?

2
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:39,219
Now it's crow soup

3
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:40,522
I call an eye

4
00:00:40,724 --> 00:00:41,474
Me too

5
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:42,316
Me three

6
00:00:42,516 --> 00:00:44,243
And Maggie gets the beak

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,951
Your hovel got in the way of my horse

8
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:56,289
Kiss his hooves in apology

9
00:00:58,231 --> 00:00:59,975
Please forgive us noble steed

10
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:03,411
Our nostrils are not worthy of your
mighty stench

11
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:06,635
are those new horse shoes

12
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:08,287
Oh they look good on you;

13
00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:15,665
Lousy nobles

14
00:01:15,865 --> 00:01:18,101
We serf are starving while they're feasting

15
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:20,217
and jousting and posing for tapestries

16
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:21,497
where they're friends with a unicorn

17
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:22,983
as if any unicorns would like them

18
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,526
unicorns like nice people

19
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:25,846
I am a nice person

20
00:01:25,988 --> 00:01:26,731
Young lady

21
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:28,939
that kind of talk is anti fearless

22
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:30,020
and i wont have it

23
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:31,382
without feudalism

24
00:01:31,522 --> 00:01:32,846
we wouldn't have this hovel

25
00:01:33,046 --> 00:01:33,883
or bountiful filth

26
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,780
or my awesome buboes

27
00:01:36,232 --> 00:01:36,670
Ohh

28
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,599
I'll lance you later

29
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,560
Bart

30
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,591
They just stuck new severed heads up
on the city wall

31
00:01:45,715 --> 00:01:46,859
Oh, can we go mom

32
00:01:47,068 --> 00:01:48,059
can we, can we?

33
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,183
That's a lovely idea

34
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:51,835
And we can bring my mom

35
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:54,859
I hope she is doing okay
in her new nurshing home

36
00:01:58,747 --> 00:02:00,452
which one is your mom's web

37
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:01,883
Son, is that you?

38
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:02,732
No

39
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,000
You ruined my nap

40
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,912
just like you ruined
my daughter's life

41
00:02:08,112 --> 00:02:08,896
That's her

42
00:02:13,198 --> 00:02:15,248
They didn't skimp on the tar

43
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:18,023
That's the secret of long lasting heads

44
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:20,872
There's Ned Flanders

45
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:23,480
It's always nice when you know someone

46
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,109
Those were kind of sideburns

47
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,662
i was saying you should grow

48
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:29,732
Pretty sharp

49
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:32,169
pretty pretty sharp

50
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:35,003
See how the heads of rich people
get the tallest pikes

51
00:02:35,179 --> 00:02:36,136
with the best view

52
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:37,346
It's so unfair

53
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:39,663
I told you to lay off feudalism

54
00:02:39,863 --> 00:02:40,989
It's the only system we know

55
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:42,863
We have no choice about it

56
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,324
therefore it's the best

57
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:46,903
The system is designed to keep us down

58
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:48,346
That's not true

59
00:02:48,546 --> 00:02:49,984
In a great country like ours

60
00:02:50,194 --> 00:02:53,342
a poor girl can grow up
to be anything she wants

61
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:54,072
A wife

62
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:55,298
Or a harlot

63
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:56,488
And that's it

64
00:02:56,688 --> 00:02:58,464
I wanted to be a harlot

65
00:02:58,664 --> 00:03:00,193
but it's all who you know

66
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:01,665
it's never too late

67
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:04,225
everyone is somebody's weird fetish

68
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,639
Mom, what's wrong with your skin?

69
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:08,529
It's blue

70
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:09,882
and ice cold

71
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:12,518
This could be a serious disease

72
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:14,930
Homer, she needs a medical attention

73
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,450
pretty, pretty sharp

74
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,443
It's never easy to say this

75
00:03:22,643 --> 00:03:24,640
You've got genital snarf

76
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,253
La la la la la la
we've got our new home

77
00:03:28,453 --> 00:03:29,077
Doc,

78
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:31,890
Is there any way to control
the occasional flare-ups?

79
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:32,537
Nope

80
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,282
Now what'd have we here

81
00:03:38,482 --> 00:03:40,831
progressive frozen mortification

82
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:43,671
this can only be the bite of

83
00:03:43,815 --> 00:03:44,949
an ice walker

84
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:46,579
An ice walker?

85
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:48,557
Mom, how did this happen?

86
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,965
I dated a ravenous wight

87
00:03:51,138 --> 00:03:52,880
who abhors the warmth of the living

88
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,695
And?

89
00:03:53,895 --> 00:03:54,895
He got fresh

90
00:03:55,095 --> 00:03:56,328
I am sorry baby

91
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:57,720
I know I am a screw up

92
00:03:57,815 --> 00:03:59,327
But you've gotta give me another chance

93
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:00,743
I love you

94
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,468
She's nine hundred years
younger than you

95
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:03,668
you pervert!

96
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,307
I like 'em young

97
00:04:05,507 --> 00:04:06,660
That ain't no crime

98
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:10,377
Is my mom gonna be okay?

99
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:12,953
I am sorry but a week from now

100
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,789
your mother would be a frozen solid

101
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:15,691
Noo!

102
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:17,037
No that can't be

103
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:19,629
she's barely into her hag years

104
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,485
All you can do is give her
leeches for the pain

105
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:24,339
Here's an organizer

106
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:25,522
So,

107
00:04:25,722 --> 00:04:28,321
So there's nothing we can do to save her?

108
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:30,535
Well, there's one treatment

109
00:04:30,735 --> 00:04:33,425
All we have to do is buy this amulet

110
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,255
my mom is saved

111
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,793
Yeahhh...

112
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:38,678
but a hundred GP

113
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,508
I mean that's more than
a tenth-level fighter makes

114
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:43,154
in an entire campaign

115
00:04:43,354 --> 00:04:44,602
Don't worry

116
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:45,669
We'll figure it out

117
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:49,162
Hey, sweet young thang

118
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:51,643
what time they'd cut you down

119
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:53,922
Oh, baby

120
00:04:57,942 --> 00:05:01,280
Okay, we just need to come up with
a hundred gold pieces

121
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,213
How much do we have in our savings?

122
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:05,592
Let me think

123
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:11,823
What are savings?

124
00:05:12,023 --> 00:05:13,775
Well then we can sell our possessions

125
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:14,838
the pig

126
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:15,966
the spoon

127
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,371
the gelatinous cube
has to be worth something

128
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,360
Is this because of what happened to the cat?

129
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,201
I told him not to nap on me

130
00:05:23,401 --> 00:05:23,797
Soo,

131
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:24,963
That's on him

132
00:05:25,163 --> 00:05:26,490
Look, honey

133
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,262
I love your mom

134
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,827
As crones go she's tops

135
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:33,092
but does it make sense

136
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:34,861
i mean total sense

137
00:05:35,061 --> 00:05:36,888
to spend all that money

138
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:40,759
so a really old lady can get
a little bit older

139
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:42,790
this is my mom's life

140
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:44,963
This family would do whatever it takes

141
00:05:45,117 --> 00:05:46,102
to keep her alive

142
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:47,604
is that understood?

143
00:05:47,804 --> 00:05:48,811
Of course, of course

144
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:50,463
Good

145
00:05:52,996 --> 00:05:54,077
All i am saying is...

146
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:57,027
Homer Serfson

147
00:05:57,227 --> 00:05:59,024
You're the most selfish jerk

148
00:05:59,087 --> 00:06:01,292
in the entire Tri-Kingdom area

149
00:06:01,472 --> 00:06:02,760
I should've listened to that witch

150
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,138
and married my twin brother, Markery

151
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:07,827
Always here if you need me, sis

152
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:09,027
get lost freak!

153
00:06:09,227 --> 00:06:10,273
She chose me

154
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:12,578
You get that money to save my mom

155
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:15,082
or never set foot in this hovel again

156
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:18,836
good things come to those who wait

157
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:26,504
Is Marge still sore at you Homer?

158
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:27,425
Yeah

159
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,390
It's not like i want to kill her mother

160
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,601
I just wanna let her die from neglect

161
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:34,167
If i dont get money for that amulet

162
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:36,145
I'll be sleeping on the iron couch

163
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:40,946
Now let's see here

164
00:06:41,046 --> 00:06:44,615
An urgent message for Milady Gwendolyn Partz

165
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:46,140
Uh, Milady Partz?

166
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,587
Hey, has anyone seen Milady Partz?

167
00:06:48,787 --> 00:06:51,089
Ah come on
Somebody grab Milady Partz

168
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:52,263
That depends

169
00:06:52,463 --> 00:06:54,006
How big is your dowry

170
00:06:56,623 --> 00:06:57,382
You little craven

171
00:06:57,397 --> 00:06:58,868
If I ever get my hands on you

172
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:00,540
I am gonna slice you open

173
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:02,207
and drain all of your humus

174
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:02,870
Blood

175
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,925
Black bile

176
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:04,763
Yellow bile

177
00:07:04,963 --> 00:07:06,182
And phlegm

178
00:07:17,558 --> 00:07:18,405
Okay

179
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,370
Break's over

180
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:26,088
Uh, Lord Montgomery

181
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:29,215
I've had some unforseen family
medical expenses

182
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,526
And I was wondering...

183
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:33,058
could i get an advanced on my salary

184
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:34,229
Uh, but first

185
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,429
can I have a salary?

186
00:07:37,068 --> 00:07:37,902
Peasants

187
00:07:38,102 --> 00:07:40,274
Serfson, you've pushed that wheel around

188
00:07:40,474 --> 00:07:41,887
and around for twenty years

189
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,136
Did you ever wonder why?

190
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:45,506
Mostly i just pust it

191
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:46,620
Have you ever noticed

192
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,469
that the wheel isn't hooked up to anything

193
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,561
The rumors were true

194
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:54,394
But you work does produce
something very special

195
00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:55,594
Human misery

196
00:07:55,794 --> 00:07:57,064
which when collected,

197
00:07:57,264 --> 00:07:58,957
ground into a powder and snorted

198
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,220
gives rich people tiny wings
that do nothing

199
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:03,777
So if you help me,

200
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:05,118
it reduces my suffering

201
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,998
which means less wing powder

202
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:07,949
for my betters

203
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:09,694
I am glad we had this talk

204
00:08:09,894 --> 00:08:10,894
But I really need the money for...

205
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:11,451
Flit-flit

206
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:13,231
Thank you for your time

207
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:21,540
Hey, Azzlan

208
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,192
Marge, my child

209
00:08:23,383 --> 00:08:26,537
I've come to offer solace
in this difficult time

210
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:29,085
you mean, convert me to your religion

211
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:30,819
when i am at my most vurnerable

212
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:33,013
No, no, no, no, no!

213
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,951
I am just here to ask you
an important question

214
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:38,315
Have you heard the news?

215
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:40,816
Yes, yes
I would be saved

216
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,817
thanks so much for stopping by

217
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:44,240
I am just gonna leave you with
this literature

218
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,066
in the buffet, God...

219
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,458
I can't go home and face your mom

220
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:49,174
without the money for that amulet

221
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,441
In here

222
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:54,184
Do you have your lucky lead nugget

223
00:08:54,384 --> 00:08:55,207
Always

224
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:59,683
A lead-lick a day keeps the doctor...

225
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:11,963
Gold

226
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:13,205
Sweet sweet gold

227
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:15,409
Why didn't you ever tell us
you could do magic

228
00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:17,045
Because if the king finds out

229
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:20,201
He'll take me away and forces me to be
one of his evil wizards

230
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:21,976
You necromancing nitwitzs

231
00:09:22,176 --> 00:09:24,176
I wanted an all-seeing eye

232
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:25,098
Not this

233
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:28,867
No daughter of mine is gonna end up

234
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,832
in the hex trade

235
00:09:29,977 --> 00:09:31,407
Let's go buy that amulet

236
00:09:31,607 --> 00:09:32,541
And don't worry,

237
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:34,070
Mum's the word

238
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,596
Did you say the word

239
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:40,711
Hey Azzlan

240
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:43,596
Twelve nothing

241
00:09:43,796 --> 00:09:44,558
my serve

242
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:47,149
You know, eventually

243
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:48,628
you're gonna run out of us

244
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:50,604
I said, my serve

245
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:51,817
Mom

246
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:54,057
I've got a surprise for you

247
00:09:54,257 --> 00:09:55,735
Thanks to who?

248
00:09:55,835 --> 00:09:57,516
I said it when i was eleven

249
00:09:57,716 --> 00:09:58,857
And I'll say it now

250
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,423
You're the greatest husband in the world

251
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:06,214
Where'd a dirt-poor loser like you

252
00:10:06,414 --> 00:10:08,009
get all the gold for that?

253
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:09,140
Well...,

254
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,929
Let's just say

255
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:13,570
I strangled the Leprechaun

256
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,066
I am not wearing that

257
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:17,876
but without it you'll die

258
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,603
fine by me

259
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:20,864
What!?

260
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:22,638
I want to die

261
00:10:22,838 --> 00:10:23,979
Oh, typical

262
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,887
I wanna live, I wanna die

263
00:10:25,987 --> 00:10:27,176
just make up your mind

264
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,443
they're both terrible

265
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,210
I've lived a full life

266
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,249
I saw a drawing of an ocean

267
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:37,340
I watched my daughter married an Ogre

268
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,786
I am not an Ogre

269
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:42,019
My father married an ogre

270
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:45,248
after my mother was eaten by
a different ogre

271
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,131
you're my mom

272
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:50,826
I can't bear the thought of saying good-bye

273
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:59,098
you want me to live, I'll live

274
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:07,018
Let's celebrate

275
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:08,829
I'll roast a hobbit for dinner

276
00:11:11,052 --> 00:11:13,615
Bet you've a packet of South Farthing
pipe weed

277
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:14,753
she picks me, Gaffer

278
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:16,013
Hush now, lad

279
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:17,691
the big folk will choose who's tastiest

280
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:18,594
and no mistake

281
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,265
How do you know you got them from me?

282
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:24,704
We miss you

283
00:11:24,904 --> 00:11:26,037
We miss you, too

284
00:11:26,237 --> 00:11:27,112
love you

285
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,753
love you, more!

286
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,603
is it really so bad for grandma
if she dies?

287
00:11:36,803 --> 00:11:39,346
wont she spend enternity
in the field of Bliss?

288
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,426
Yeah

289
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:43,472
We're all going to the field of Bliss

290
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,675
where the days are passed
in frolic most joyous

291
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:47,875
Just frolicking?

292
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:48,930
That's it?

293
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,595
Sometimes you wave ribbons through the air

294
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:53,482
but mainly frolicking

295
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:54,708
Doesn't that get old?

296
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:56,145
Did I mention the ribbons?

297
00:11:56,345 --> 00:11:57,326
cause there's ribbons

298
00:11:57,526 --> 00:11:58,636
Field of Bliss?

299
00:11:58,812 --> 00:11:59,286
Nonsense

300
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,665
the afterlife is an eternity of slaughtering

301
00:12:01,865 --> 00:12:04,168
and being slaughtered by your enemies

302
00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:05,177
Oh yeah

303
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:06,303
You both wrong

304
00:12:06,414 --> 00:12:10,146
after death you spend all day
counting goblin Jesus' money

305
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:12,074
And it better all be there

306
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,741
Seventy one mermaids

307
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,594
somewhere the fish is the top part

308
00:12:16,465 --> 00:12:17,400
Mushrooms

309
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,271
Everywhere mushrooms

310
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:21,718
Frolicking and ribbons

311
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:22,879
Yeah, but...

312
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:24,737
What if after we die,

313
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:26,040
that's it

314
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,316
we're just gone

315
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:29,897
So just poof?

316
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:30,742
Really?

317
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:33,196
Poof and then just super nothing?

318
00:12:34,396 --> 00:12:35,303
Well, it's clean

319
00:12:35,344 --> 00:12:36,644
I'll give you that

320
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:43,730
Oh yeah

321
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,872
This is way better than death

322
00:12:47,072 --> 00:12:47,936
Come on, mom

323
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:50,648
There's so many things we can say
to each other now

324
00:12:50,848 --> 00:12:51,994
Oh really?

325
00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:52,972
Okay then

326
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,198
Say then

327
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,193
I am waiting

328
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,149
Well...

329
00:12:58,349 --> 00:12:59,870
what about you guys?

330
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,823
What do you want to ask your grandma?

331
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:03,842
I've got nothing

332
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:04,747
I am gonna take a stroll

333
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:06,326
and enjoy the golden age of cleavage

334
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:07,185
Lisa?

335
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:08,442
Uhmm...

336
00:13:11,017 --> 00:13:11,772
Grandma?

337
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:14,563
Tell us your most ardent swain

338
00:13:14,763 --> 00:13:17,114
I dated a little shape-shifter once

339
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:18,990
I thought i could keep him from changing

340
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:20,389
I was wrong

341
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:23,082
Love is a fairy tale

342
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:28,578
Every moment with her is a precious gift

343
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:30,413
Yes, yes it is

344
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:33,772
All that matters is that we're family
and we're together

345
00:13:42,094 --> 00:13:43,878
Sorcerer-intended Chalmers

346
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,245
Your daughter has been detected
using a witchcraft

347
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:49,918
Under the magic the gathering act,

348
00:13:50,118 --> 00:13:52,771
She is hereby property of the crown

349
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:53,854
What?

350
00:13:54,054 --> 00:13:55,805
My daughter isn't a magician

351
00:13:56,005 --> 00:13:58,073
Oh I am terribly sorry but she is

352
00:13:58,273 --> 00:14:01,613
Yes, the moment that she transmuted
lead into gold

353
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:03,650
our palantirs they just went bananas

354
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,270
I've never seen palantirs go so bananas

355
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,917
It was the only way

356
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:09,951
I just don't want you to be sad
about grandma

357
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:11,423
Oh no

358
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:13,067
This is all my fault

359
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:14,691
Don't blame yourself honey

360
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:17,118
We're all at fault from doing
whatever it takes

361
00:14:17,318 --> 00:14:18,390
to make you happy

362
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:20,312
Help!

363
00:14:20,512 --> 00:14:21,635
You can't nap my kid

364
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:22,835
that's kidnapping

365
00:14:23,035 --> 00:14:24,496
Toenail Imprisonum!

366
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:28,782
D'oh!

367
00:14:28,982 --> 00:14:29,982
Lisa's magic?

368
00:14:30,182 --> 00:14:31,373
Maybe I am a magic too

369
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:33,645
Abra-carumba!

370
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:36,136
You just grab a stick
and say a funny word

371
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:38,098
That's not insulting to us at all

372
00:14:38,298 --> 00:14:39,685
Please don't take my daughter

373
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:42,239
She's only trying to save her grandmother

374
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:44,415
She sounds like a wonderful kid

375
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:46,679
Now please say good-bye to her forever

376
00:14:50,104 --> 00:14:51,424
Take a present leave a present

377
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:56,674
She's gone

378
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:58,171
Lisa's gone

379
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:00,633
Clip me out of here Marge

380
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,928
I am gonna rescue Lisa

381
00:15:02,038 --> 00:15:04,075
if i have to kill every noble
in that castle

382
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:04,993
But dad

383
00:15:05,261 --> 00:15:06,872
Serfs can't rise up against nobles

384
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,719
you'd be attacking the system itself

385
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,099
And nobody loves feudalism more than you

386
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:11,751
Son,

387
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:14,266
feaudalism is a beautiful vision

388
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:15,633
The bill of no rights

389
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,932
One person no vote

390
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:19,934
But I am willing to betray all that

391
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:21,592
to get my daughter back

392
00:15:22,752 --> 00:15:24,696
Hey, you mind if i dissolve those?

393
00:15:24,896 --> 00:15:25,814
Uh, just checkin

394
00:15:25,914 --> 00:15:26,755
better to ask

395
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:28,410
Better to ask

396
00:15:29,753 --> 00:15:30,234
Peasants

397
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:31,065
Peons

398
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,846
and distinguished beggars

399
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,890
Are you tired of the nobles taking
the wheat we sow?

400
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,290
the yarn we spin and the wine we steal

401
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,766
from travellers we murder on the road

402
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:46,639
They even take our children

403
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:48,868
And not just the worthless Bart

404
00:15:49,068 --> 00:15:50,760
but the magical Lisa

405
00:15:54,022 --> 00:15:57,006
If we can put a moon-spangled hat on a man

406
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,136
why can't we kill a bunch of rich jerks

407
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,863
and take their stuff

408
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,608
How are we going to get over this walls?

409
00:16:19,808 --> 00:16:22,583
Walls cannot stop us

410
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,588
The trees would fight with you

411
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:28,537
We would never forget your sacrifice

412
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,030
Sacrifice?

413
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:36,543
We could've torn down the castle walls
in five minutes

414
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:40,302
Trees can't talk silly

415
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,884
Lisa: Mom, Dad

416
00:16:55,084 --> 00:16:57,075
Help!

417
00:16:57,275 --> 00:16:59,508
Milhouses, save your girlfriend

418
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,467
Lisa, lisa, lisa

419
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:02,112
Okay

420
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,586
No, I am just a friend...

421
00:17:04,786 --> 00:17:06,095
who is a girl

422
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:08,360
It's something to build on

423
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:15,735
You peasants are a drag-on the economy

424
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,978
Oh, I get it

425
00:17:18,178 --> 00:17:20,576
because he's riding a dragon

426
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:26,103
My love for worldplay is undiminished

427
00:17:30,455 --> 00:17:31,810
Oh no, we're losing

428
00:17:33,398 --> 00:17:35,017
We need to talk

429
00:17:35,217 --> 00:17:35,999
Now?

430
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,027
Yes now

431
00:17:37,227 --> 00:17:38,698
It's time for me to

432
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:40,103
Go

433
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,000
Life's about moving forward

434
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,650
Girls want to be women

435
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,236
Women want to be mothers

436
00:17:45,436 --> 00:17:46,758
Mothers want to be grandmas

437
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,122
And grandmas want to know what comes next

438
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:52,347
But what if I am not ready?

439
00:17:52,481 --> 00:17:55,499
I wont leave you if i dont know
you'll be alright

440
00:17:58,493 --> 00:17:59,437
Okay Mom

441
00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:00,749
I understand

442
00:18:02,745 --> 00:18:04,556
Maybe I was born a peasant

443
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:06,698
but i am going out an ice queen

444
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:36,101
Ouch

445
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:39,653
Now we won

446
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:47,320
My mom gave her life to save ours

447
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,359
Take comfort, Marge

448
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,989
Now she's in the field of Bliss

449
00:18:52,185 --> 00:18:54,545
No, she is in Goblin money heaven

450
00:18:54,745 --> 00:18:57,100
The afterlife is snake chewing your eyes

451
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,805
but it feels good

452
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,586
This is our heaven

453
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:02,663
Or...

454
00:19:02,863 --> 00:19:05,368
As long as grandma lives on in our hearths,

455
00:19:05,568 --> 00:19:07,672
then she's never truly gone

456
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:08,939
Until we die

457
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:10,231
then it's like she never existed

458
00:19:10,431 --> 00:19:11,646
And someday,

459
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:13,817
No one will remember you

460
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:15,727
Or anybody

461
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:19,087
All is well the nobles are defeated

462
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:20,209
the dragon is dead

463
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,929
And I have a daughter
who can turn lead into gold

464
00:19:25,112 --> 00:19:26,406
Uhm actually,

465
00:19:26,507 --> 00:19:27,630
I can't anymore

466
00:19:27,764 --> 00:19:30,039
Dragon's fire is the source of all magic

467
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:31,985
And granda killed the last one

468
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:35,009
Everything wondrous
and extraordinary about our world

469
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:36,560
is going to fade

470
00:19:38,368 --> 00:19:41,192
But maybe now we can use science
to improve our world

471
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:42,850
With new technologies,

472
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,505
we can put an end to poverty and disease

473
00:19:45,705 --> 00:19:47,273
Sure it would be hard work,

474
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:49,781
but far more rewarding than waving your hand

475
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,218
over a rock to change it into gold

476
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:53,398
I mean

477
00:19:53,532 --> 00:19:55,112
Please come back magic

478
00:19:57,056 --> 00:19:58,519
live damn you, live

479
00:20:03,175 --> 00:20:05,131
I am risen

480
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:06,540
But what about science?

481
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,091
Oh sweety

482
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:10,922
Who would want to live in a world
without magic?

483
00:20:11,023 --> 00:20:12,386
It would be so boring

484
00:20:12,454 --> 00:20:15,040
People would have to make up fantasy stories

485
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,452
Most of them poorly-written pretenses
for explicit sex and violence

486
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:22,375
Just to escape the tedious real world

487
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:24,730
That does sound awful

488
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,868
Look, the dragon is burning our village

489
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,405
I love our lives
