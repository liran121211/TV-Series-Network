2
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:06,376
- Homer.
- Hey.

3
00:01:06,377 --> 00:01:08,218
- Homer.
- Huh? What?

4
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,346
- I'll be right home.
- You are home.

5
00:01:12,016 --> 00:01:13,216
Homer.

6
00:01:13,217 --> 00:01:16,019
Homer, wake up, please. I can't sleep.

7
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,155
I'm having friends over tomorrow.

8
00:01:18,156 --> 00:01:20,624
- Luann Van Houten.
- Back-stabber.

9
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,659
- Bernice Hibbert.
- Snob.

10
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,361
And Helen Lovejoy.

11
00:01:24,362 --> 00:01:25,562
Okay, she's pretty hot.

12
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:26,997
I mean, hot for a reverend's wife,

13
00:01:26,998 --> 00:01:28,836
but so judgmental.

14
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:32,536
I was going to ask you if
you could watch Maggie.

15
00:01:32,537 --> 00:01:33,837
Oh, yeah, of course.

16
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:35,556
What do you suspect?

17
00:01:37,842 --> 00:01:39,409
Isn't this great?

18
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,211
Daddy-baby alone time.

19
00:01:41,212 --> 00:01:43,547
Where's Daddy? Peek-a-boo.

20
00:01:45,717 --> 00:01:48,151
Where's Daddy? Peek-a-boo.

21
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:50,320
- Where's Daddy? Peek-a-boo.
- Meh.

22
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:52,522
Where's Daddy? Peek-a-boo.

23
00:01:52,523 --> 00:01:54,725
Where's Daddy? Peek-a-boo.

24
00:01:54,726 --> 00:01:56,360
Oh, you're sick of it already?

25
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:58,495
I was gonna do different people.

26
00:01:58,496 --> 00:02:01,031
Peek-a-boo-ooh!

27
00:02:01,032 --> 00:02:02,866
I'm afraid, Master Wayne,

28
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:05,001
it's time for peek-a-boo.

29
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:06,503
Ah, come on. Nothing?

30
00:02:06,504 --> 00:02:08,387
Babies love Michael Caine.

31
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,541
What to do? What to do?

32
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,177
What to... do.

33
00:02:14,178 --> 00:02:17,765
What... to... do.

34
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:20,440
Mags, I'll level with you.

35
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:21,809
I love you, kiddo,

36
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,613
but we are in two completely
different worlds.

37
00:02:30,604 --> 00:02:33,588
- More lemonade, ladies?
- No, thank you.

38
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:36,491
I've had better lemonade
at Ralph Wiggum's stand.

39
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:38,819
And he stirs it with his finger.

40
00:02:41,697 --> 00:02:44,799
So we've been asked to
redecorate the school room

41
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,068
where the kids wait when
their ride is late.

42
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:48,637
I have some ideas.

43
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:51,292
Marge, you have many wonderful talents,

44
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:53,328
but your sense of style is, uh...

45
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:55,731
- One of them?
- I'm afraid not.

46
00:02:55,732 --> 00:02:57,666
Purple and orange cupboards,

47
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:59,101
oh, corncob curtains,

48
00:02:59,102 --> 00:03:01,136
rabbit ears on the TV.

49
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:03,538
It's like we're visiting
the Flintstones.

50
00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:07,342
Well, since you don't like my style,

51
00:03:07,343 --> 00:03:09,277
maybe I should show you the door.

52
00:03:09,278 --> 00:03:12,381
You mean the brown door
next to the hot pink walls.

53
00:03:12,382 --> 00:03:14,282
Just like at the circus.

54
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:16,685
Well, an elephant does live here.

55
00:03:16,686 --> 00:03:18,153
An elephant?

56
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:20,489
You're calling my husband an elephant?

57
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,791
Marge, we got any more peanuts?

58
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:24,810
Oh, Homer.

59
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:27,562
Hmm.

60
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:29,581
No.

61
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:33,368
What the...?

62
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:36,705
Is it that bird?

63
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:42,411
- Marge! Are you making tea?
- Yes.

64
00:03:42,412 --> 00:03:44,346
- Whew.
- Iced tea.

65
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:45,981
What the hell?

66
00:03:47,316 --> 00:03:48,984
This is WHIS.

67
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:50,986
Whistling at you all day and night.

68
00:03:50,987 --> 00:03:53,555
WHIS, The Whistle.

69
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:57,159
Ah. Whistling format radio.

70
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,661
Huh?

71
00:03:59,662 --> 00:04:02,414
Where is that whistling coming from?

72
00:04:05,117 --> 00:04:06,167
Maggie?

73
00:04:10,707 --> 00:04:12,207
It is you!

74
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,277
It's so odd... I'm a terrible whistler.

75
00:04:15,278 --> 00:04:17,512
Always have been.

76
00:04:17,513 --> 00:04:20,015
There must be a reason you
were given this gift.

77
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:24,319
It's to make people
think I can whistle.

78
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:30,192
Homer! Homer! Homer!

79
00:04:30,193 --> 00:04:32,127
And now I will perform

80
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:35,731
"Flight of the Bumblebee."

81
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:51,413
Who was that president?

82
00:04:51,414 --> 00:04:52,931
He looked pretty generic.

83
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:59,121
I do too have taste.

84
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:01,490
I'm afraid not.

85
00:05:01,491 --> 00:05:03,510
Corncob curtains.

86
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,293
Mom, what's wrong?

87
00:05:05,294 --> 00:05:07,129
Why aren't you answering me?

88
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,497
I'm right here.

89
00:05:08,498 --> 00:05:11,084
Honey, I'm just feeling
sorry for myself,

90
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:12,567
but I'll show them.

91
00:05:12,568 --> 00:05:16,071
I'll make a late pickup room
like that school has never seen.

92
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:18,123
That'll be easy, there's never been one.

93
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:57,312
Well, what do you think
of my late pickup room?

94
00:05:57,313 --> 00:05:59,114
It's wonderful. Hard to believe

95
00:05:59,115 --> 00:06:01,716
it's the same room they found
all those dead rats in.

96
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:05,770
Well, maybe you can fool the Hibberts,

97
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:07,197
but to me, this is the work of a...

98
00:06:07,198 --> 00:06:08,590
Genius.

99
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:10,078
Salud.

100
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:13,628
Well, gee.

101
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:15,697
Guess who got a job today.

102
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:16,832
- You?
- Nope.

103
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,733
The guy who went in after me.

104
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:20,969
I-I totally set him up.

105
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,506
Listen, I recently purchased the
old post office to renovate.

106
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:28,677
Would you like to be
my interior decorator?

107
00:06:28,678 --> 00:06:30,712
Well, ladies.

108
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:32,981
Looks like someone appreciates me...

109
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:35,632
The one man in town who trims his nails.

110
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:38,420
Is one of them giving you trouble?

111
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:40,322
There's no room in the trunk, boss.

112
00:06:40,323 --> 00:06:41,823
- Bodies?
- No.

113
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:43,592
Bottled water and
toilet paper, remember?

114
00:06:43,593 --> 00:06:45,894
We made that Costco run.

115
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:49,698
Now do it backwards.

116
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:52,834
Now sideways.

117
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:54,369
Hey, come on. She's just a baby.

118
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,537
Who is?

119
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:56,671
Uh, my talent.

120
00:06:56,672 --> 00:06:57,939
Makes sense.

121
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,875
Well, well, well.

122
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:03,278
Seems like my no-talent
son can suddenly whistle.

123
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,581
Tell me, Homer, how'd
you trill that high "C"

124
00:07:06,582 --> 00:07:08,884
with your lips in second position?

125
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:17,042
Oh, it's amazing.

126
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,598
She's got my whistling gene, all right.

127
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,067
Which, unfortunately,
skips a generation.

128
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:29,037
I hope it works out better
for you than it did for me.

129
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:31,973
I was booked on the top
whistling show on radio,

130
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:35,610
Your Blow of Blows, with Sid Wheezer.

131
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,448
Good evening, folks. Sid Wheezer here,

132
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:43,018
sipping a delicious Buzz Cola.

133
00:07:46,188 --> 00:07:47,622
Ah, refreshing.

134
00:07:47,623 --> 00:07:50,325
Keep polio at bay, the Buzz Cola way.

135
00:07:51,394 --> 00:07:52,594
Oh, thanks a lot.

136
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:53,795
Our next act is a swell kid

137
00:07:53,796 --> 00:07:55,330
from right here in Springfield.

138
00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:57,766
His hobby is straightening
elbow macaroni.

139
00:07:57,767 --> 00:08:00,502
Let's here it for
Little Abraham Simpson.

140
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,007
Then I got cocky.

141
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:08,977
Tried a little stunt
called the Triple Windy.

142
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:22,457
Blew out the ligaments in my lips.

143
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,492
Had to hire guys to kiss my girlfriend.

144
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:25,994
It was a good deal.

145
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:27,362
I'd pay for five minutes,

146
00:08:27,363 --> 00:08:29,264
but it would go on for hours.

147
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,000
When the time was right,

148
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:33,601
I'd make my move.

149
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:40,976
But this little magpie,
she's got my gift.

150
00:08:40,977 --> 00:08:43,589
And now she's going into showbiz.

151
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,847
Couldn't showbiz screw her up?

152
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:47,349
You know, like it did Ron Howard?

153
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,285
He hasn't won an Oscar since 2002.

154
00:08:50,286 --> 00:08:53,121
Oh, please, son, do this for me.

155
00:08:53,122 --> 00:08:56,024
Dad, you should not live your
life through your granddaughter.

156
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,820
You poor guy. She'll do it.

157
00:09:17,082 --> 00:09:19,800
Okay, Maggie. Time to learn a happy tune

158
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:22,069
from these imprisoned birds.

159
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,316
Man, Maggie's talented, Lisa's talented.

160
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,693
- What am I good at?
- The birds love ya.

161
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:33,072
Well, yeah, but they also love Grampa.

162
00:09:34,683 --> 00:09:37,734
Go ahead, but my blood's turned to bile

163
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:40,637
from watching Fox News.

164
00:09:44,342 --> 00:09:46,476
This is my new property,

165
00:09:46,477 --> 00:09:49,312
the original Springfield Post Office,

166
00:09:49,313 --> 00:09:52,349
jewel of the implosion district.

167
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,053
You'll get used to that.

168
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:00,924
We'll definitely want to try
to keep the original facade.

169
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:02,125
Yes, indeed.

170
00:10:02,126 --> 00:10:04,795
I'm all about keeping up facades.

171
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:06,997
Is it okay if I take some
foundation measurements?

172
00:10:06,998 --> 00:10:08,498
Of course.

173
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:10,600
In case she sees
something she shouldn't,

174
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:12,352
have a hood ready.

175
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:18,775
Idiota! You whack who you shouldn't,

176
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:20,811
and you don't whack who you should.

177
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:23,613
Is this about your brother again?

178
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,024
You're gonna love this baby!

179
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:36,293
- She whistles!
- This I gotta hear...

180
00:10:36,294 --> 00:10:38,428
Not because I am looking forward to it,

181
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,480
but because it is my job.

182
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:47,571
Fantastic talent!

183
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:50,140
Now, move along... I have
a heart attack at 4:00.

184
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:51,708
And... here it comes.

185
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:53,693
Ooh! Oy vey!

186
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:00,617
You sit on it, you bought it.

187
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,835
Due!

188
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:05,822
Can you picture this water feature

189
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:08,358
at the back wall of the foyer?

190
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:11,027
My sainted mother shared your gift.

191
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:13,463
Where others saw only an
empty Chianti bottle,

192
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,899
she saw a candle holder.

193
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,088
We would have to rip out some walls.

194
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:19,159
Done.

195
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,304
You won't be seeing
those walls no more.

196
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,140
Why do these guys come
with us for everything?

197
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,176
Have you noticed how we are not dead?

198
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:28,578
That is mostly due to them.

199
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:30,814
Give the wall job to
the Palermo brothers.

200
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,483
Tell them to make it
look like an accident.

201
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,386
We'll make that wall dig its own grave.

202
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,327
What's that whistling?

203
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,196
You know what they say... in a marriage,

204
00:11:46,197 --> 00:11:48,932
don't ask a question you
don't know the answer to.

205
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:51,235
That's what they say
to defense attorneys.

206
00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:55,005
Marge, how would you feel if I
kept a big secret from you?

207
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,124
How would you feel if I
kept a big secret from you?

208
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:01,137
- Good night.
- Good night.

209
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,954
Maggie, you can whistle?

210
00:12:12,623 --> 00:12:15,025
You're gifted, too!

211
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,127
Maybe more gifted!

212
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:19,763
No, no, I will not get
caught in that trap

213
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:21,911
that only one of us is good.

214
00:12:21,912 --> 00:12:24,548
We could both be good,
like the South Park guys.

215
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:26,438
Except Trey does everything.

216
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:28,287
Trey does everything!

217
00:12:33,693 --> 00:12:35,076
Diva.

218
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:37,963
This little piggy went to Broadway.

219
00:12:37,964 --> 00:12:40,198
This little piggy worked with Stallone.

220
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:43,335
This little piggy got
a Showtime special!

221
00:12:45,571 --> 00:12:47,572
I'm a great father.

222
00:12:47,573 --> 00:12:49,901
Tonight on Hollywood Nightmares,

223
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,444
- What?!
- Child stars, prison bars.

224
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:54,346
Ooh!

225
00:12:54,347 --> 00:12:57,394
At three months old, Skyler
Green could already patty-cake.

226
00:12:57,395 --> 00:12:59,418
By age one, she was the opening act

227
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:01,803
for Frank Sinatra Jr. Jr. III.

228
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:07,092
But after a disastrous
Super Bowl halftime show

229
00:13:07,093 --> 00:13:10,228
that left Jacksonville's
EverBank Field in ruins,

230
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:13,165
Skyler's life would spin out of control.

231
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,900
She began a downward spiral,

232
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:17,002
woke up too many mornings
with stuffed animals

233
00:13:17,003 --> 00:13:18,870
whose names she didn't know,

234
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:20,939
and she was arrested twice
for former cuteness,

235
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,674
under the Scott Baio Law.

236
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:25,010
Patty-cake, patty-cake, baker's man,

237
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:28,914
bake me a train wreck
just as fast as you can.

238
00:13:28,915 --> 00:13:31,016
Oh, my God. Am I doing this for you,

239
00:13:31,017 --> 00:13:33,134
or because it makes me feel good?

240
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:37,456
A showbiz kiss!

241
00:13:37,457 --> 00:13:40,903
There's nothing more sincere
than that. We'll do it!

242
00:13:49,283 --> 00:13:52,121
Marge, I love what you've done here.

243
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,690
It's as much "Mwah!"

244
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:55,957
as it is "Ey! Whoa!"

245
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,993
It certainly was a
challenge... so many bedrooms.

246
00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:01,796
You must be expecting a
lot of sleepover guests.

247
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:04,332
Is she, er, uh, one of the, uh...?

248
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,501
No, no. She's the decorator.

249
00:14:06,502 --> 00:14:08,603
But I can get one like her.

250
00:14:08,604 --> 00:14:10,772
Add it to my customer profile.

251
00:14:10,773 --> 00:14:12,640
Er, uh, yes.

252
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:14,676
Dim lighting,

253
00:14:14,677 --> 00:14:16,411
honky-tonk piano...

254
00:14:16,412 --> 00:14:18,112
Anthony D'Amico,

255
00:14:18,113 --> 00:14:20,615
what is the repute of this house?

256
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:22,016
Ill.

257
00:14:22,017 --> 00:14:24,752
Our top story... you didn't see me.

258
00:14:24,753 --> 00:14:25,933
This is...

259
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:28,406
John Doe saying "Good night."

260
00:14:34,627 --> 00:14:37,786
Why is everyone being so
weird? Did the principal call?

261
00:14:37,787 --> 00:14:39,367
'Cause he's got nothing to call about.

262
00:14:42,404 --> 00:14:45,440
I can't keep this mountain lion
in my bedroom forever, Bart.

263
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:47,141
Just four more days.

264
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:51,996
So listen, uh, I'm gonna
take Maggie out for a walk.

265
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:58,402
These spray-on boas are
such a time-saver.

266
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:04,139
Oh, God, that's good.

267
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:09,013
Seems like everybody's got a
secret but us, huh, guys?

268
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:16,237
Tonight, see Maggie Simpson,

269
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:17,405
the Unborn Comic,

270
00:15:17,406 --> 00:15:18,654
The Umbilical Chords

271
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:20,641
and the Pixie Chicks.

272
00:15:20,642 --> 00:15:21,943
And now your host,

273
00:15:21,944 --> 00:15:24,412
Sedgwick the Personality!

274
00:15:24,413 --> 00:15:26,814
Welcome to whatever this is.

275
00:15:26,815 --> 00:15:28,816
Now, let's meet our judges.

276
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:32,420
NBA star and host of Flip That Igloo,

277
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:34,956
Muk Mu!

278
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:36,157
Peace.

279
00:15:36,158 --> 00:15:38,092
Former Hot Tots champion,

280
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:40,661
Baby Dimples Riskind!

281
00:15:40,662 --> 00:15:44,632
And robotic-themed DJ Der Zip-Zorp!

282
00:15:49,188 --> 00:15:52,740
You had lunch, didn't you?

283
00:15:52,741 --> 00:15:55,176
I gave you a 2:00 a.m.
curfew for a reason!

284
00:15:55,177 --> 00:15:56,411
Shut up!

285
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:58,913
Where's denial when you need it?

286
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:00,681
Maggie, this is no place for you.

287
00:16:00,682 --> 00:16:04,168
I'm taking you where you can
be a kid again... Moe's.

288
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:12,226
Oh, I've created a monster!

289
00:16:12,227 --> 00:16:14,245
I've placated a monster!

290
00:16:15,815 --> 00:16:16,831
Oh...

291
00:16:16,832 --> 00:16:19,967
Marge Simpson, are the rumors true?

292
00:16:19,968 --> 00:16:22,403
Did you corncob a cathouse?

293
00:16:22,404 --> 00:16:24,372
It's not that.

294
00:16:24,373 --> 00:16:28,609
I sure love that new whorehouse smell.

295
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,512
Marge, I never thought someone
could sink this town lower,

296
00:16:31,513 --> 00:16:33,281
but you have.

297
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,843
You lied to me!

298
00:16:35,844 --> 00:16:37,018
You may scare these guys,

299
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,754
but to me, you're just a big fat liar!

300
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:42,306
Whoa. Nobody calls Fat Tony fat!

301
00:16:42,307 --> 00:16:43,357
Nobody!

302
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:44,759
In the old country,

303
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,562
only two were allowed to
speak truth to the Don...

304
00:16:47,563 --> 00:16:50,898
His capo and his interior decorator.

305
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:52,800
You are lucky.

306
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:54,168
Now, please leave.

307
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:55,870
The launch party is tonight.

308
00:16:55,871 --> 00:16:58,639
The Grey Goose people are
bringing a big ice thing.

309
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,243
Well, Anthony, not knowing
what I was designing for,

310
00:17:02,244 --> 00:17:04,445
there's something I didn't tell you.

311
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:07,181
Your mother had a post office box

312
00:17:07,182 --> 00:17:09,050
at this office.

313
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:12,603
I don't know whether to believe you.

314
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:19,443
Oh, looks like a letter from the pope.

315
00:17:24,684 --> 00:17:28,074
You have surrounded a blessed
letter to your mother

316
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:30,071
with a bordello!

317
00:17:30,072 --> 00:17:32,073
That's it! Shut it down!

318
00:17:32,074 --> 00:17:34,992
Apologize to our dear
friends at Grey Goose.

319
00:17:36,863 --> 00:17:39,046
So, what are you going
to do with my work?

320
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:41,582
A little "Italian lightning"
for insurance purposes.

321
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:45,551
And that is the last question
of yours we will ever answer.

322
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:48,089
Good-bye, Mrs. Simpson.

323
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,892
Can't you at least wait until
I'm out of the building?

324
00:17:50,893 --> 00:17:53,394
I'm sorry, I get nervous,
I do dumb things.

325
00:17:53,395 --> 00:17:55,496
Maybe it's because I'm wearing a wire.

326
00:17:55,497 --> 00:17:56,614
Uh-oh.

327
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:00,768
Now, put your hands together for
the one who's going to win.

328
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:02,737
Whoops. That's supposed to be a secret.

329
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:04,605
Nothing I can do... in one moment,

330
00:18:04,606 --> 00:18:07,975
Maggie will stop being my little
baby and belong to the world.

331
00:18:07,976 --> 00:18:11,512
I remember her when she was
just a bit of bad news.

332
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:15,182
Time for the greatest glory
there is... reflected.

333
00:18:15,183 --> 00:18:16,751
Aw...

334
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:26,527
Oh, come on, I'm cheating
on my wife to see this?

335
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:30,765
Look! She's got a tooth coming in!

336
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:32,667
That's the kiss of death for a whistler.

337
00:18:32,668 --> 00:18:34,435
Give me a string and a doorknob!

338
00:18:34,436 --> 00:18:37,772
That baby is naught but
an overly dramatic,

339
00:18:37,773 --> 00:18:39,941
boring windbag!

340
00:18:39,942 --> 00:18:42,944
A windbag that yields no succor!

341
00:18:42,945 --> 00:18:45,846
In sum, a nothing!

342
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:51,686
What? They're booing my Maggie?

343
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:54,221
This is the sweetest
little girl in the world.

344
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:57,474
Nice try, but no hook can fit me.

345
00:19:00,046 --> 00:19:02,330
This little angel never makes a fuss.

346
00:19:02,331 --> 00:19:04,165
She always shares her baby food,

347
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,768
and she makes even a despicable
show like this seem sweet!

348
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:10,004
Hey, pal, this is a
talent show for babies.

349
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:11,422
We ain't goin' for sweet.

350
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:18,479
The only thing that's been
worth it about this experience

351
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,016
is that I got to spend time
with this little girl.

352
00:19:22,017 --> 00:19:24,456
And that's the tooth!

353
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:27,688
Good night, my little star.

354
00:19:27,689 --> 00:19:29,557
And if you have another amazing talent,

355
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:32,593
for the love of God, don't tell anybody.

356
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:34,031
Nighty-night.

357
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:43,055
Okay, so I'll never enter
Maggie into another contest
