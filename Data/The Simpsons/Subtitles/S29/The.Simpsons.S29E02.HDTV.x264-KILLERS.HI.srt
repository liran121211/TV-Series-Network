No!

8
00:00:29,408 --> 00:00:32,207
Oh, I have to go all
the way around again.

00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,810

(panting)

12
00:00:39,756 --> 00:00:41,618
I had the locker dream again.

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,888
Oh, honey, that's four nights in a row.

14
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,756
Stupid recurring dreams.

15
00:00:46,758 --> 00:00:48,825
Why can't brains come
up with something new?

16
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:51,828
That's why they're losing
viewers to Netflix. (snores)

17
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,220
Maybe I should talk to a therapist.

18
00:00:54,223 --> 00:00:57,267
Sweetie, our insurance won't
pay for any more sessions.

19
00:00:57,269 --> 00:00:59,803
Your father used them
all up on grief counseling

20
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:02,138
after the Halloween candy ran out.

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,808
I've come to accept that
we were lucky to have it

22
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,608
while we did. (sniffles)

23
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:08,278
But I know a cheap
place where you can see

24
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:10,848
the therapists of tomorrow today.

25
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:13,389
Behold, Springfield Community College,

26
00:01:13,392 --> 00:01:16,823
where the students practice... on you!

27
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:20,423
I only paid a student dentist
$12 for this brand-new crown.

28
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:21,832
See?

29
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:23,717
I don't think it's supposed to come out.

30
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,028
That's why I paid a student
paralegal to sue him.

31
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:27,230
I lost!

32
00:01:27,232 --> 00:01:29,232
- (tooth clattering)
- (humming)

33
00:01:30,314 --> 00:01:32,181
(school bell rings)

34
00:01:32,184 --> 00:01:34,337
- Oh, yarr.
- HOMER: Mm.

35
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:37,240
Yarr! Yarr.

36
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:38,241
(gulps)

37
00:01:38,243 --> 00:01:40,243
TV must be a circle!

38
00:01:40,245 --> 00:01:41,978
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

39
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:45,715
Give him the full flea dip
and deluxe under-worming.

40
00:01:45,717 --> 00:01:47,050
I'm not a dog.

41
00:01:47,052 --> 00:01:48,585
And I've been worm-free for two weeks!

42
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:50,420
You better muzzle him. He's a biter.

43
00:01:50,422 --> 00:01:51,933
(grunting)

44
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:55,170
My name is Annette, and
I'm a therapist-in-training.

45
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:56,925
I'm also a mother-to-be,

46
00:01:56,928 --> 00:01:58,862
so I know there's nothing more beautiful

47
00:01:58,864 --> 00:02:00,626
than a child's feelings.

48
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:03,099
You sound so caring and professional.

49
00:02:03,101 --> 00:02:05,568
(quietly): When do I give
you the seven dollars?

50
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,017
There's a shoebox by the door.

51
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,386
(school bell rings)

52
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,273
So what does my locker dream mean?

53
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:11,811
Am I stressed about school?

54
00:02:11,814 --> 00:02:13,676
I mean, schools are full of lockers.

55
00:02:13,678 --> 00:02:16,079
Hey, who's the almost-therapist here?

56
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:17,914
(Lisa whimpers)

57
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:21,384
Huh.

58
00:02:21,386 --> 00:02:22,519
Hmm.

59
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:23,520
Oh.

60
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:24,654
Ooh.

61
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:25,955
Huh.

62
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:27,290
Mm.

63
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,756
You know, I think you might
benefit from art therapy.

64
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,197
Ooh!

65
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,533
Draw in these empty panels

66
00:02:36,535 --> 00:02:38,206
to tell the story of a typical day

67
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:40,637
in the life of you, Sophia Barnum.

68
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,905
Huh?

69
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:44,440
Once again, learn the patient's name.

70
00:02:44,442 --> 00:02:45,642
Sorry, Professor.

71
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:47,177
Lisa Simpson.

72
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:49,045
Excellent. Continue.

73
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:51,514
Your light's still on.

74
00:02:52,688 --> 00:02:54,083
LISA: <i>Art therapy.</i>

75
00:02:54,085 --> 00:02:57,430
Okay, draw a typical day.

77
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,860
Ugh! Horrible!

78
00:03:03,862 --> 00:03:06,362
It looks like it was
drawn by an eight-year-old!

79
00:03:06,364 --> 00:03:07,412

Ugh!

82
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:16,639
Oh, boy, I can't wait
to take you to the park.

83
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:18,975
The other owners will be so jealous.

84
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:20,577
You're not my owner.

85
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,378
Uh, I kinda am.

92
00:03:35,193 --> 00:03:36,859
MARGE: Mm.

93
00:03:36,861 --> 00:03:40,096
I'm hearing a lot of feelings in here.

94
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:43,099
You're hearing them because
I am not drawing them!

95
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:45,702
Aw, sweetie, drawing is tricky.

96
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:48,905
But you just need to start with
something simple, like people.

97
00:03:48,907 --> 00:03:50,441
Those <i>are</i> people.

98
00:03:50,444 --> 00:03:51,610
Ooh.

99
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:55,511
(grunts) It's easy, honey.

100
00:03:57,515 --> 00:04:00,116
Add some eyelashes here,

101
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:02,585
some crosshatching to show shadow,

102
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:06,122
vary the line width here
to accent the outline,

103
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:08,267
- and voilà!
- (gasps)

104
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,826
That's great!

105
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:11,094
Now in the next panel,

106
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:12,829
I want her to be looking out a window,

107
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:14,564
wondering if she'll ever get out

108
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:17,233
from under the weight
of her own expectations.

109
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:20,709
Well, I could make the
eyebrows come down in a "V."

110
00:04:20,712 --> 00:04:22,672
LISA: That says it all.

111
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:23,975
(Marge grunts)

112
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:27,342
Hey, Mom, what if I told
you the things I was feeling

113
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:29,012
and you drew them?

114
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:30,747
Okay. But I'm warning you,

115
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:32,882
I'm not good at drawing turtle feet.

116
00:04:32,884 --> 00:04:34,817
So if there are any turtles in this,

117
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:36,419
they're gonna be wearing sneakers.

118
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:37,553
Deal.

119
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:40,523

You published my private
art therapy as a comic book?

162
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:45,156
Um, actually, it's a graphic novel.

163
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,658

where it's our whole thing.

176
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:13,652
I shall burn them on a pyre

177

00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:25,977
what advice would you
offer to young women?

263
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:27,979
Always remember nothing is more valuable

264
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:29,648
than your own unique voice.

00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,517
Also, when they promise you
a tote bag for doing a panel,

266
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,320
make sure it's not just
a reusable grocery bag.

a lot of people have been
talking about the Bechdel Test.

00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:44,529
Exactly what kind of
drinking game is that?

271
00:10:44,531 --> 00:10:46,665
Actually, it's just
an observation I made

272
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,800
about how movies and TV rarely show

273
00:10:48,802 --> 00:10:51,336
two women talking about
something other than a man.

274
00:10:51,338 --> 00:10:52,804
That's so interesting.

275
00:10:52,806 --> 00:10:54,939

Honey, I was thinking.

300
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:48,309
What if we did a chapter
from the mom's point of view?

301
00:11:48,312 --> 00:11:50,871
I took a stab at writing
it up. Give it a read.

302
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:52,140
In front of you?

303
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:54,765

What are you laughing at?

308
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:03,341
You left out a word here,

309
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:07,212
so it just says, "I lonely."

310
00:12:07,214 --> 00:12:09,214
So should I start drawing it?

311
00:12:09,217 --> 00:12:12,135
Well, there's a lot of great stuff here.

312
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:15,106
Really? Because that's
what I was going for.

313
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,623
But I'm not sure this is a <i>Sad Girl</i> thing.

314
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,258
Maybe it's a separate book

315
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,393
and I could write the forward.

316
00:12:22,395 --> 00:12:23,995
Oh, I get it.

317
00:12:23,997 --> 00:12:26,409
This isn't a real collaboration at all.

You agree with those girl fanboys.

319
00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:30,702

00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:36,908

323
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,640
I hate to say it, Mom,

324
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:41,846

326
00:12:46,052 --> 00:12:48,826
No. I mean, maybe we should take

327
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:50,889

328
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:52,724

329
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:55,521

- She's acting like a real B.

00:13:04,538 --> 00:13:06,538
My name is Guthrie Frenel,

visionary theatrical
director and impish genius.

337
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:13,111
And I want to make <i>Sad Girl</i>

341
00:13:20,937 --> 00:13:23,845
You want to make <i>Sad
Girl</i> into a stage musical?

342
00:13:23,848 --> 00:13:27,270
If I may borrow a phrase
from my father, woo-hoo!

343
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:28,954
This is all very exciting,

344
00:13:28,957 --> 00:13:30,506
but before we go any further...

345
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:33,109
And I ask this just for clarification...

346
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:35,278
- What's your deal, weirdo?
- Dad.

347
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,743
Guthrie Frenel is a visionary
director and an impish genius.

348
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:40,683
He did a version of <i>Waiting for Godot</i>

349
00:13:40,685 --> 00:13:44,020
- where Godot appears in the first scene.
- What?

350
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:47,223
And that was nothing compared
to my vision for <i>Sad Girl.</i>

351
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,459
I want to do something new and amazing,

352
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,661
like my all-dog version of <i>Cats.</i>

353
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:53,463
But I need something from you.

354
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,798
- Anything.
- I need your passion.

355
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,166
I need your joy.

356
00:13:57,168 --> 00:14:00,403
Are we all together for this
three-person toboggan ride

357
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:02,505
down Mount Collabor-manjaro?

358
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:06,376
Well, Lisa and I did
just have a little spat.

359
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:10,013
Yeah, but conflict is part of
the creative process, right?

360
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,681
Not in my experience!

361
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:13,750
So are you in?

362
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,161
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

363
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,689
