LoLo. That's what they
called her in captivity,

And may I just tell you,
you've always been my hero.

00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,124
Thank you. But I wonder,

411
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,895
how many female scientists
have you told they're your hero?

412
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:54,798
In your field? Um, only three.

413
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,702
Oh, well. Good enough.
We'll take fine care of PoPo.

- See you soon.
- Wait. Come back.

00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:03,874
Take me with you. I want a life
exactly like yours.

416
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:07,745
Well, so do hundreds of others,
but still, you might get lucky

417
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:11,047
if you work really hard
and get a doctorate.

418
00:19:11,048 --> 00:19:12,583
Would you give me a scholarship?

419
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,486
No, you'd have to save up, like I did.

420
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,488
Then there's a slight chance
you'll have me?

421
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,691
Well, very slight, but don't give up.

422

good as someone who owns a boat
