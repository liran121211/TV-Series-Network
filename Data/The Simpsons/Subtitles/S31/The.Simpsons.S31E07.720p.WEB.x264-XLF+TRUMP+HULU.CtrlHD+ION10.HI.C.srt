Thanks for hosting.

3
00:00:08,223 --> 00:00:09,798
How was the sleepover?

4
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:13,060
They each had a 5-Hour Energy
drink and a jar of Nutella

5
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:16,346
and then watched Russian
dashcam videos all night.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,067
Listen, Marge.

8
00:00:20,068 --> 00:00:23,070
Every year, Kirk and I rent
a luxury villa in Costa Rica

9
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:26,573
and invite a few select families
to join us. (chuckles)

10
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:28,666

13

14
00:00:37,285 --> 00:00:38,994

16

17

Nope, nope.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,018
(popping lips)

19
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:48,503
Sorry, it's news to me.

20
00:00:48,504 --> 00:00:50,380
We were wondering, would your family

21
00:00:50,381 --> 00:00:52,132
be interested in joining us?

22
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:53,934
When would you need an answer by?

23
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:55,719
Oh, the sooner the better.

00:00:59,557 --> 00:01:01,558
Costa Rica!

27
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,665

28
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:04,703
MARGE: Costa Rica!

29

The Van Houtens invited<i> us</i>

38
00:01:20,077 --> 00:01:22,913
on their super-exclusive
multi-family vacation

39
00:01:22,914 --> 00:01:24,750
to Costa Rica!

40
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,876
We'll stay in a luxury villa
right on the beach...

41
00:01:27,877 --> 00:01:28,877
Whoo-hoo!

42
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:31,063
...near pristine rain forests,

43
00:01:31,064 --> 00:01:34,216
home to five percent
of the species on Earth...

44
00:01:34,217 --> 00:01:36,282
Biodiversity!

45
00:01:36,283 --> 00:01:40,052
...in a land where it's normal
for kids to carry machetes.

46
00:01:40,053 --> 00:01:41,232
Legalize it!

47
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:43,934
And<i> you</i> can chew on the guidebook.

48
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:46,820
I've always dreamed
of being the kind of family

49
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:50,417
that other families would be
willing to do things with.

50
00:01:50,418 --> 00:01:52,444
BART AND LISA (chanting): Costa Rica!

51
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,328
- Costa Rica!
- Airport food court!

52
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,713
- Airport food court!
- Costa Rica!

53
00:01:59,408 --> 00:02:01,076
Whoa.

54
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:04,971
Now, that's a tympanic membrane
that just won't quit.

55
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:09,084
HOMER: Whoa.
This trip's gonna cost how much?

56
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:10,752
MARGE: I know it's expensive,

57
00:02:10,753 --> 00:02:13,463
but we spend our whole lives
worrying about money.

58
00:02:13,464 --> 00:02:15,774
That's because we don't have that much.

59
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:18,093
We have a mortgage, a reverse mortgage.

60
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:20,450
I think the house is owned by the car.

61
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:22,973
Life is about experiences.

62
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:26,268
Look at this photo the Hibberts
posted from last year's trip.

63
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:28,270
Now look at<i> my</i> feed.

64
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:29,646
Yeah.

65
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:31,024
Oh, boy.

66
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:34,949
I want a photo of you and me
by that waterfall.

67
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,946
The hope of going on this trip
is the only reason

68
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:41,402
I've allowed Bart
to stay friends with Milhouse.

69
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:44,119
Now I understand everything.

70
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,121
MARGE: Homie, I know it's a stretch,

71
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:48,474
but if Kirk and Luann can afford it...

72
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:50,717
Yeah. He can't earn that much.

73
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:53,003
His job is moving the Topless Maids van

74
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:55,323
so they don't get parking tickets.

75
00:02:55,324 --> 00:02:59,252
Let's have one damn fling and
hope everything will be okay.

76
00:02:59,253 --> 00:03:01,331
You know what? You are right.

77
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:03,391
I am sick of being the responsible one

78
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,598
in this marriage.

79
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,899
Let's live life.

80
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,245
Remember, we can never be poor

81
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:10,478
as long as we have each other.

82
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,541
(both sigh)

83
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:14,082
(groaning): Oh... yes, we can.

84
00:03:17,745 --> 00:03:19,672
You know, what if we stayed home

85
00:03:19,673 --> 00:03:21,823
and just did puzzles of Costa Rica?

86
00:03:21,824 --> 00:03:25,252
I mean, this trip sounds
really expensive.

87
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:27,921
- No, not really.
- What? No!

88
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:32,000
You just let the grown-ups worry
about grown-up things, okay?

89
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:34,169
(chuckles) Your mom and dad

90
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,605
have our financial future
all under control.

91
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:40,008

92
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:41,468
Ooh! Free ticket!

Ah, the multi-family vacation.

96
00:03:48,368 --> 00:03:49,868
Let's see who we've got.

97
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:51,945
The Van Houtens, of course.
The Hibberts.

98
00:03:51,946 --> 00:03:54,898
Superintendent Chalmers
and his daughter.

99
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:56,875
I can't believe
my father is tearing us apart

100
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:58,785
for a whole week.

101
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:00,546
Sweetie, it's a very long flight.

102
00:04:00,547 --> 00:04:02,530
Why don't you save your phone battery.

103
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:04,964
All you care about is batteries!

104
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:06,701
You've never been in love.

105
00:04:06,702 --> 00:04:08,745
Your mother and I had a very...

106
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:10,556
(sighs) Never mind.

107
00:04:10,557 --> 00:04:12,057
Yep, not one person here

108
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:15,394
I'd mind spending
an extended period of time with.

109
00:04:15,395 --> 00:04:18,880
I didn't have time to wax,
so I'll do it on the plane.

What the hell is<i> that</i> doing here?

112
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:25,428
Well, Lou the cop and his sister
were gonna go,

113
00:04:25,429 --> 00:04:26,980
but a billboard fell on him

114
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:29,599
and her wind chime store burned down.

115
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,578
So I suggested Patty
and her new girlfriend.

116
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,580
You deliberately hid this from me

117
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:36,490
until it was too late to back out.

118
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:38,775
- Yes.
- Don't try to deny it.

120
00:04:40,403 --> 00:04:43,666
Patty's new relationship
really has to work out,

121
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:46,431
because the dating apps
won't take her anymore.

00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:20,579
(laughs) Does a mama possum
skip church on Sundays?

182
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,080
Hmm.

183
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:24,566
I bet she does.

184
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:26,326
(laughs)

185
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:28,069
Homer, put your phone away.

186
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,675
Evelyn, please.

187
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:31,948
(both chuckle)

188
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,166
♪ ♪

189
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:36,077
Evelyn, you don't want
to go shopping with us?

190
00:07:36,078 --> 00:07:38,393
It's a vacation, sugar bear.

191
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:41,191
We should be lying on the beach
like a lost flip-flop.

192
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:43,160
(chuckles)

193
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:46,754
But, darling, there's nothing
to do at the beach except drink.

194
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:50,213
You know what? Why don't
you two take in the sights

195
00:07:50,214 --> 00:07:53,094
while I chaperone your
Southern señorita to the beach?

196
00:07:53,095 --> 00:07:57,098
Well, my, my, what an elegant solution.

197
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:59,526
Well, I guess this way everyone's happy.

198
00:07:59,527 --> 00:08:01,118
(Marge and Patty grumble)

199
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:04,705
(Evelyn chuckles)

200
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:08,943
Tonight's dinner is amazing, folks:

201
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:11,282
line-caught mahi mahi.

202
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:14,824
The local fishermen pass the
lines down from father to son,

203
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:17,118
so, boy, you can taste the heritage.

204
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:18,136
(monkeys screeching)

205
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:19,471
KIRK: <i>Dios mío!</i>

206
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:20,997
Eh, what?

207
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:22,549
Oh. Hey, guys.

208
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,001
We met these awesome monkeys
on the beach,

209
00:08:25,002 --> 00:08:27,128
and we said they could crash here

210
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:29,480
in exchange for them being hilarious.

211
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,012
(laughs) Sweetie, you did not tell me

212
00:08:36,013 --> 00:08:38,473
your brother-in-law was such a fun guy.

213
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:41,326
You two should be<i> so</i> happy.

214
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:44,298
Your husband and your girlfriend

215
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:46,314
are amigos!

216
00:08:46,315 --> 00:08:47,682
(Marge and Patty grumble)

217
00:08:47,683 --> 00:08:49,815
(gasps) Who's that with you, Jimbo?

218
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:51,609
Is that Stacy?

219
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,171
Oh, my God.

220
00:08:53,172 --> 00:08:55,542
Jimbo is cheating on me!

221
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:57,049
Wha...?

222
00:09:01,481 --> 00:09:03,515
Okay, makeup kit, selfie stick.

223
00:09:03,516 --> 00:09:06,167
(gasps) Oh, God, where's
the selfie stick charger?

224
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:07,335
Honey, relax.

225
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:10,188
The waterfall picture's
going to be fine.

226
00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:12,382
Fine? If this photo is just "fine,"

227
00:09:12,383 --> 00:09:14,192
we're getting a divorce.

228
00:09:14,193 --> 00:09:16,603
- (whimpers)
- Okay, okay, that crossed the line,

229
00:09:16,604 --> 00:09:18,864
but this is a once-in-a-lifetime trip

230
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:22,545
and our only shot at a perfect moment.

231
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:26,538
I get it... you're mad
about my awesome monkey party.

232
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:29,166
But you wanted me to be nice
to Patty's girlfriend,

233
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,067
and guess what. She's cool.

234
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:33,879
Just what you need,
another drinking buddy.

235
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,957
Just promise me you'll behave
for the rest of the trip.

236
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,242
Okay, okay. I will stay far away

237
00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:41,294
from Patty's fun Southern girlfriend.

238
00:09:41,295 --> 00:09:43,329
Or as she would say,

239
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,373
"further away than a fat-cheeked boy

240
00:09:45,374 --> 00:09:47,968
from a porch full of grannies."

241
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:49,585
(giggles)

242
00:09:49,586 --> 00:09:51,879
Run, fat boy, run!

243
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,522
(grunting)

244
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:56,901
(anxious panting)

245
00:09:58,071 --> 00:09:59,404
Why are you freaking out?

246
00:09:59,405 --> 00:10:00,630
Shouldn't you be in the jungle

247
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:02,724
kissing a boa constrictor or something?

248
00:10:02,725 --> 00:10:05,268
This trip is so expensive,
and Mom and Dad don't care,

249
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:07,895
so I'm practicing sleeping in a car

250
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:10,749
for when we lose the house
and have to sleep in our car!

251
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,533
Well, Milhouse's dad writes down
how much money everyone owes

252
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:16,112
in that book,
so all we have to do is snag it,

253
00:10:16,113 --> 00:10:17,723
then show Mom and Dad the numbers.

254
00:10:17,724 --> 00:10:21,258
Yes! That'll snap 'em
out of their financial insanity.

255
00:10:22,336 --> 00:10:24,787
You up for a little
breaking and entering?

256
00:10:24,788 --> 00:10:27,173
Break into a grown-up's bedroom?

257
00:10:27,174 --> 00:10:29,225
Whoa, big move.

258
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:32,052
Okay, we'll do it
when everyone's on the hike.

259
00:10:32,053 --> 00:10:34,174
But how do we get rid of Milhouse?

260
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,510
Not a problem.
Milhouse already ditched me

261
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,719
for Dr. Hibbert's kid.

262
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,927
His "vacation friend."

263
00:10:39,928 --> 00:10:43,264
Hey, JJ, do you still like Legos?

264
00:10:43,265 --> 00:10:45,881
- Uh... not really.
- Me neither.

265
00:10:45,882 --> 00:10:48,695
Lego sucks! (grunts)

266
00:10:48,696 --> 00:10:52,624
Hey, JJ, why don't we put on a
play for the grown-ups tonight?

267
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:56,277
Ooh, sweetie, look,
a "Flowers of Costa Rica"

268
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:59,992
scavenger hunt. I wonder
how many we can find together?

269
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,045
Just braid, Daddy!

270
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:05,045
I need to look super hot
to win back Jimbo's heart.

271
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:06,954
(sighs) Darling, you're experiencing

272
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:09,307
so many emotions for the first time.

273
00:11:09,308 --> 00:11:11,459
And that's very healthy, but...

274
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,936
He strayed because of you!

275
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:19,008
Hey, JJ, one time my friend got
a temporary tattoo

276
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:21,987
but told his dad it was real.

277
00:11:21,988 --> 00:11:24,641
Okay, let's steal that ledger.

278
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,767
What's that thing?

279
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,826
Grappling hook made
of Patty's underwire bra

280
00:11:27,827 --> 00:11:29,552
and Dad's bathing suit drawstring.

281
00:11:29,553 --> 00:11:31,163
Will it reach?

282
00:11:31,164 --> 00:11:32,038
(grunts)

283
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:37,960
(clicks)

284
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:44,325
This is so weird, being in
another grown-up's bedroom.

285
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:48,755
Boy, you're telling me.
He doesn't even work out.

286
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:52,500
Uh, I don't want to learn
anything else about this family.

287
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:54,094
It's too late.

288
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:55,978
(both shuddering)

289
00:11:57,431 --> 00:11:59,265
All right, bottled water break.

290
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:01,267
I can drink from the stream.

291
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:05,363
After all these years,
my gut biome is<i> simpatico</i>

292
00:12:05,364 --> 00:12:07,118
with the local bacteria.

293
00:12:09,756 --> 00:12:13,279
Ugh! Oh, God, there's something
moving inside me!

294
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,565
Oh, look out! Oh, look out!

295
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:18,043
Look out, I said look out! Look out!

296
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:22,530
Oh, God, no<i> simpatico!</i> No<i> simpatico!</i>

297
00:12:22,531 --> 00:12:25,625
Hey, Homer. You want a hit off this?

298
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:29,704
Oh, Evelyn. You and I both love
secret day drinking,

299
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:31,914
but I promised Marge I'd have a bad time

300
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:33,558
the rest of this vacation.

301
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:36,297
I hear exactly what you're saying.

302
00:12:37,638 --> 00:12:40,981
Mm-hmm? Mmm.

303
00:12:43,236 --> 00:12:45,428
- (gasps)
- Did you find the ledger?

304
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:48,556
No, but take a look at this.

305
00:12:48,557 --> 00:12:50,575
These are stone spheres

306
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:54,439
made by the extinct
Diquis people of Costa Rica.

307
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,141
No one knows what they were for,

308
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,107
but they're priceless artifacts.

309
00:12:58,108 --> 00:13:01,586
So what is Milhouse's
loser dad doing with them?

310
00:13:01,587 --> 00:13:03,496
- (lock clicks)
- (both gasp)

311
00:13:03,497 --> 00:13:05,615
(Kirk groans)

312
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:08,075
Oh, I'm sorry, Kirk's tum-tum.

313
00:13:08,076 --> 00:13:09,285
(groans)

314
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:10,745
Daddy drank some ick-ick.

315
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:12,580
(Kirk groans)

316
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:14,081
Oh, the rumblies are coming.

317
00:13:14,082 --> 00:13:15,874
The rumblies are coming!

318
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,419
- They're here!
- (Bart grunts)

319
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,180
(Kirk groans)

320
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:22,515
If we get this photo right,

321
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:26,325
this multi-family vacation
will be worth every penny.

322
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:27,779
(Homer giggles)

323
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,675
You're so cute
when you're super controlling.

324
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:31,782
- (Marge sniffs)
- (phone camera clicks)

325
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:33,372
You've been drinking.

326
00:13:33,373 --> 00:13:35,144
(slurring): Well, maybe Evelyn added

327
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:37,956
a little Southern charm to my water.

328
00:13:37,957 --> 00:13:41,130
That woman!
She brings out the worst in you!

329
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:42,985
Look!

330
00:13:42,986 --> 00:13:44,129
MARGE: Oh, my God.

331
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,780
It's perfect.

332
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:47,657
You look good, and I look better.

333
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:49,560
Post it. Post it.

334
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:51,303
EVELYN: Homer!

335
00:13:51,304 --> 00:13:55,289
Buddy, hi. Watch me do
a Savannah Polecat Flip.

336
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,016
(whoops, grunts)

337
00:13:58,293 --> 00:14:00,060
No!

338
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:03,056
Come back, camera fish!

339
00:14:03,057 --> 00:14:05,107
(grunting) Oh!

340
00:14:06,134 --> 00:14:07,652
(grunts)

341
00:14:07,653 --> 00:14:09,896
(Homer groaning frantically)

342
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:11,159
(Patty growls)

343
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,778
All I wanted was for my friends
to be jealous of me.

344
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:19,291
I hope you're happy

345
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:22,553
now that that bald gorilla
has dragged my girlfriend down

346
00:14:22,554 --> 00:14:24,669
to his pathetic level.

347
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,545
(snoring)

348
00:14:27,748 --> 00:14:29,657
Patricia Maleficent Bouvier,

349
00:14:29,658 --> 00:14:32,252
I've put up with you criticizing
my husband for years,

350
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:33,920
and I've had it.

351
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:35,347
Evelyn got Homer drunk.

352
00:14:35,348 --> 00:14:37,498
Evelyn ruined my dream photo.

353
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:39,184
<i>She's</i> the bad influence.

354
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:41,094
That's ridiculous.

355
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:44,046
She may be Southern, she may be a woman,

356
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:46,558
but you're dating a Homer.

357
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,527
(Evelyn and Homer snoring)

358
00:14:49,528 --> 00:14:51,863
Oh, no.

359
00:14:51,864 --> 00:14:55,516
Mom, look what I found
in the Van Houtens' room!

360
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:59,204
They are smuggling
these artifacts home to sell!

361
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:00,855
(all gasping)

362
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:02,754
That's how they can afford
this vacation.

363
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:04,042
But we can't.

364
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:06,044
And we're gonna have to live in our car,

365
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:08,254
and the seats in our car are sticky,

366
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:10,239
even though they're cloth!

367
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,293
(sobbing): You're... you're so gross.

368
00:15:13,294 --> 00:15:15,220
It's so gross.

369
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:18,068
Salt... and pepper.

370
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:20,133
These souvenirs were supposed to be

371
00:15:20,134 --> 00:15:23,694
our end-of-multi-family-vacation
gift to you all.

372
00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:25,611
Way to spoil the surprise.

373
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,628
Not very<i> pura vida.</i>

374
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:31,057
Not very<i> pura vida</i> at all.

375
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:32,261
(Lisa and Marge grunt)

376
00:15:32,262 --> 00:15:34,739
<i>Stacy and I are finished.</i>

377
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,402
<i>Shauna Chalmers, will you marry me?</i>

378
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,818
Oh, my God!

379
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:40,436
Jimbo proposed!

380
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:43,898
We are getting freaking married!

381
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:46,165
(chattering)

382
00:15:49,663 --> 00:15:52,088
Oh, you guys are slinking off early.

383
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:55,728
Don't you want to come ziplining
and ruin the trip some more?

384
00:15:55,729 --> 00:15:57,411
Well, I would...

385
00:15:57,412 --> 00:16:00,679
like to agree with my wife
that it's better we leave.

386
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,509
I'll give you the final bill now
so we can settle up.

387
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,087
No discount for leaving early
either. (laughs)

388
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:10,399
I may be<i> mucho pura vida,</i>
but, uh, I'm not a sucker.

389
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:13,601
Lisa was right.

390
00:16:13,602 --> 00:16:15,863
We really couldn't afford this trip.

391
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:19,984
(breathing loudly)

392
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:21,143
(whoops)

393
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:22,862
Ooh, that's a big number.

394
00:16:22,863 --> 00:16:25,205
(guttural panting)

395
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:33,614
(groans)

396
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:35,799
How's Patty? I haven't seen her.

397
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,135
I don't know what happened.

398
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:39,178
She... broke up with me.

399
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:41,881
Yeesh.

400
00:16:41,882 --> 00:16:43,549
I know you feel bad, Mom,

401
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,642
but the lady<i> is</i> a Homer.

402
00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:50,890
BOTH: Mmm.

403
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:53,175
Oh, all that money,

404
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:55,136
and we didn't even get the picture.

405
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:57,138
(gasps) Look at this.

406
00:16:57,139 --> 00:16:59,348
Mr. Van Houten even charged us

407
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:01,993
for those salt and pepper shakers.

408
00:17:01,994 --> 00:17:03,941
He said those were a gift.

409
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:05,663
And he didn't even give them to us.

410
00:17:05,664 --> 00:17:08,212
Then we're not leaving without them.

411
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:09,667
- (Homer grunts)
- (Bart yells)

412
00:17:09,668 --> 00:17:10,667
(thud)

413
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:17,417
(all gasping)

414
00:17:17,418 --> 00:17:21,470
Oh, so that explains it.

415
00:17:24,925 --> 00:17:26,926
HOMER: Gotcha.

416
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:29,879
Can't you let us even zipline in peace?

417
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,215
Look what we found hidden
in your bedroom.

418
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:36,940
This is a portrait of explorer
Kirkedemious Van Houten,

419
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:40,698
who settled this area for
a Dutch cracker-trading company,

420
00:17:40,699 --> 00:17:45,297
and he built this house,
which your family still owns.

421
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,897
You're charging us thousands
of dollars in rent

422
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:49,874
for a house you get for free.

423
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,026
The Van Houtens are cheating all of us,

424
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:55,139
so<i> we</i> pay for<i> their</i> vacation.

425
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,531
- I'm stunned.
- I'm shocked.

426
00:17:57,532 --> 00:17:59,074
I'm Shauna.

427
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:02,128
I'm just as surprised as any of you.

428
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:04,055
Oh, what?! Come on!

429
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:06,224
This scam was her idea.

430
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:09,043
And this year she even charged you more

431
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:11,563
so we could pay
for our "intimacy coach."

432
00:18:11,564 --> 00:18:14,474
I mean, how many things
can you do with a feather?

433
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:15,733
Ooh.

434
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:17,384
Oh, easy, guys, easy.

435
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:21,096
Everyone try to remain<i> pura vida.</i> Huh?

436
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:23,224
I'm gonna<i> pura vida</i> my foot in your ass

437
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:25,094
if you don't give me back my money.

438
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:27,923
He's zipping away!

439
00:18:27,924 --> 00:18:30,998
Stop him
before he endorses those checks!

440
00:18:32,943 --> 00:18:35,069
So, you and Evelyn broke up?

441
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,904
I thought you really liked her.

442
00:18:36,905 --> 00:18:40,829
I did, but now all I see
is Homer, thanks to you.

443
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,244
Patty! Come back!

444
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:47,006
I can't! Because I'm on a zipline...

445
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:48,674
Ooh. (grunts)

446
00:18:48,675 --> 00:18:53,104
Patty, I'm sorry I upset you,
but Evelyn is your Homer,

447
00:18:53,105 --> 00:18:55,940
and no one else will ever
understand why you love her,

448
00:18:55,941 --> 00:18:57,609
except for you.

449
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,427
But there's one huge difference
between them.

450
00:19:00,428 --> 00:19:02,113
(grunts)

451
00:19:02,114 --> 00:19:05,795
(Marge grunting)

452
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:07,048
I'm listening.

453
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:08,953
Evelyn loves you,

454
00:19:08,954 --> 00:19:12,698
and Homer hates you
more than anything in the world.

455
00:19:12,699 --> 00:19:14,533
Even more than he hates Selma?

456
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:16,127
He feels sorry for Selma,

457
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:18,414
because she has to live with you.

458
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:20,173
Hold on, Evelyn!

459
00:19:20,174 --> 00:19:22,549
I'm coming!

460
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,619
Go ahead, take your money.

461
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,805
Take away a man's only source of income.

462
00:19:27,806 --> 00:19:29,633
No, it's real classy.

463
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:32,501
We just got a free vacation.

464
00:19:32,502 --> 00:19:34,448
LISA, MARGE AND BART: Hooray!

465
00:19:34,449 --> 00:19:37,482
Now let's charter a helicopter
back to the waterfall

466
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:40,301
to get your mom's precious picture.

467
00:19:40,302 --> 00:19:41,818
(groans)

468
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:44,656
No, no, no. It's okay.

469
00:19:44,657 --> 00:19:47,233
Vacations aren't
about the perfect photo.

470
00:19:47,234 --> 00:19:50,978
It's about being in the moment
and living your...<i> vida.</i>

471
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:52,997
Mwah!

472
00:19:52,998 --> 00:19:54,332
(both exclaiming happily)

473
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,720
They're as cute as two bugs in a rug.

474
00:19:58,486 --> 00:20:00,337
Aw.

475
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:10,014
(laughs)

476
00:20:10,015 --> 00:20:11,683
Honey, I just want you to know

477
00:20:11,684 --> 00:20:14,001
that Jimbo Jones is a fine young man,

478
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:16,187
and I'm very happy
for you two to be married.

479
00:20:16,188 --> 00:20:18,672
- Truly.
- Yeah...

480
00:20:18,673 --> 00:20:22,038
Jimbo's parents freaked out
and canceled the wedding.

481
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,052
Whatever.

482
00:20:23,053 --> 00:20:25,158
I'm glad <i>somebody's</i> setting limits.

483
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:26,639
You know, pumpkin, I'm doing my best.

484
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,038
Do you understand that?

485
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:30,684
That as a single father,
it's not always so easy

486
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:33,448
to balance guidance
with respect for your...

487
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:35,401
Yeah...

488
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,365
<i>CHALMERS: Yeah, now
we're connecting, huh?</i>
