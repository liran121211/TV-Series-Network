In 250 A.D., Brother
Ignatius Castellaneta

83

refused to recant his Christian faith.

84
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:37,633
And so the Romans chopped off his head,

85
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,134
they chopped off his arms,

86
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:42,379
they chopped off his legs, and
they chopped off his toes.

87
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:44,923
They shot him with arrows
made of frozen snakes

88
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:46,734
and they pulled out his
eyes and replaced them

89
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:48,810
with chocolate-covered pistachios.

90
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:51,647
But still, Ignatius refused to recant.

91
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,281
So they boiled his bones
in sparkling cherry wine.

92
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:57,989

93

that is something I cannot do.

- "Remember the phrase."

359

I will. What phrase is it?

want to hear from me?

The name of the man who
framed you? I would never.

00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,464
I didn't say Johnny Tightlips.

382
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:45,092
I would never say Johnny Tightlips.

383

never would've guessed.

388
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:02,368
You mistook my taciturn
nature for fealty.

389
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:04,631
But it was simply that I
didn't feel comfortable

390
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:06,275
in social situations.

391
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,968

So I talked to my doctor about Paxil,

394
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:17,453
and it gave me the
confidence to betray you.
