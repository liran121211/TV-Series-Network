Oh! We were, of course, unraveling.

Aw. Good girl.

00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:48,426
Um, I like what you're wearing.

Thank you. These are

we go, I love Portland.

So much, I want to leave Springfield

bad that makes me realize

373
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,199
that there's no place like home.

Don't you see what's happening here?

382
00:16:36,808 --> 00:16:39,699
- You're married.
- Yes, I know.

383
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,779
- To you.
- No, to her. Look around.

384
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,619
You're married in the two most
important ways there are:

385
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,059
emotionally and cooking.

386
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,479
(CHUCKLES): Oh. That's ridiculous.

387
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,999

- They remind me of you.
- Aw.

389
00:16:55,035 --> 00:16:58,039
But I am upset. I'm
finally good at something

390
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,789

391

It's just... when are you coming home?

394
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,900
Tomorrow, after the competition.

395
