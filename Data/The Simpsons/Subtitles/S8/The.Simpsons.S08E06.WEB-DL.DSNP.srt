8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,411
Marge, can't we
get some clear plates?

9
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,497
I can't see the TV.

10
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,375
Is it really necessary
to watch TV while we're eating?

11
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,294
We're getting food all over.

12
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,019
Yoink!

13
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,688
If you really wanted us
to be neater

14
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,648
you'd serve us
out of one long bowl.

15
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,234
You're talking
about a trough.

16
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,612
We're not going
to eat from a trough.

17
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,989
And another thing,
it's only 5:15.

18
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,824
Why are you
in your underwear?

19
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,493
Hey, this ain't
the Ritz.

20
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:21,498
At least let's have a civilized
conversation, shall we?

21
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,249
Lisa, how was school?

22
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,292
How was what?
What?

23
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,502
School! School!

24
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,504
It's not time
for school.

25
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,839
I know it's not--
(groans)

26
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,925
I'm going into
the dining room

27
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,510
to have a conversation.

28
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,638
Anyone who wants
to join me is welcome.

29
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:40,892
MARGE: Hello, Marge,
how's the family?

30
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,227
I don't want
to talk about it.

31
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,478
Mind your own business.

32
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,063
Keep it down in there,
everybody.

33
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,691
Homer, is this the way
you pictured married life?

34
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,401
Yeah, pretty much.

35
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,946
Except we drove around in
a van solving mysteries.

36
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,906
Well, I pictured
cocktail parties

37
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,241
and candlelit dinners.

38
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,617
I pictured napkins!

39
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,994
Homer, I want to throw
a dinner party.

40
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,080
Oh, I hate
having parties.

41
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,957
The toilet
always gets backed up.

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,126
I don't care
if the sink shoots sludge.

43
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,585
We're having a party.

44
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,178
Man, that is flagrant
false advertising!

45
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,977
It's just not a dinner party
without a melon baller

46
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,979
and we'll need a citrus zester

47
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,313
a ravioli crimper.

48
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,858
Ooh, an oyster mallet.

49
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,277
"Made in U.S.A."

50
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,946
Oh, no, thank you.

51
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,865
Hey, Lis,
check this out.

52
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,449
Nonstick coating.

53
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,873
Ooh.

54
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,501
A punchbowl like that
just screams good taste.

55
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,420
Wouldn't it be perfect
for the dinner party?

56
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,754
Oh, we can't afford that.

57
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,798
Who do you think
I am, Liz Taylor?

58
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,593
Well, maybe we could
use it once

59
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,094
and then return it.

60
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,721
Marge, we're not
talking

61
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,723
about a toothbrush here.

62
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,603
Bart, company's coming.

63
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,730
Go put doilies under the coasters.
Hurry! Hurry!

64
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:09,689
(bell rings)

65
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,777
Lisa, quick,
screw these back on.

66
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,112
Mom, calm down.

67
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,864
The party's not for
another three hours.

68
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:18,865
Oh, good.

69
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,283
That will give me time

70
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,493
to add another coat
of glaze to the ham.

71
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,336
(grunts)

72
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,181
Homer!

73
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,432
HOMER:
What?!

74
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,558
Are you ready?!

75
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,894
Just got to put my shoes on.

76
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,021
The only thing I asked
you to do for this party

77
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,940
was put on clothes
and you didn't do it.

78
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,066
(doorbell rings)

79
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,400
And now it's too late!

80
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,902
They're here!

81
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,363
Bart, greet our guests
and take their coats.

82
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,618
Mom, Reverend Lovejoy
doesn't have a coat.

83
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,619
Should I let him in?

84
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,995
My coat was stolen

85
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,206
at last week's
interfaith banquet

86
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,415
so I helped myself

87
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,376
to a few
of the better umbrellas.

88
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,669
Well, as you can see

89
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,837
we don't believe
fur is murder.

90
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,965
But paying for
it sure is.

91
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,675
(laughing)

92
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,218
Uh, sorry we're late

93
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,637
but Luann had to
put on her face.

94
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,722
She doesn't want
anyone to know

95
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,807
she's got no eyebrows.

96
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,642
What? You don't.

97
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,106
(all conversing)

98
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,984
Did anyone see that
new Woodsy Allen movie?

99
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,819
You know, I'd like
his films except for

100
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,445
that nervous fellow
who's always in them.

101
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,240
If you want to talk nervous,
you should have seen Kirk deal

102
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,617
with the high school boys
who egged our Bonneville.

103
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,245
I should've asked them
to hurl some bacon.

104
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,622
Then maybe I could've had
a decent breakfast for once.

105
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,670
HOMER: You know what
you two need?

106
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,756
A little comic strip
called "Love Is".

107
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,218
It's about two naked eight-year-olds
who are married.

108
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,016
Hmm, well...

109
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,851
Marge, if that was
my last meal

110
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:13,438
I'd tell the warden, "Bring on
the lethal injection".

111
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,815
Yeah, Marge, I know
I haven't eaten that well

112
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,525
since I was in the army.

113
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,860
Or that noisily.

114
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,653
All right, that's it.

115
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,572
So, who wants
to play a game?

116
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,531
Hmm, hmm, hmm?

117
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,911
Oh... That's a
noodle scratcher.

118
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,496
(gasps):
Cornstarch!

119
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,956
Oh, righty-oh!

120
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,835
It's good for keeping
down the urges.

121
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,505
Oh, come on, Luann.
You know what this is.

122
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,758
Kirk, I don't know
what it is.

123
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,720
Ah, it could not be
more simple, Luann.

124
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,180
Do you want me to show
this to the cat

125
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,057
and have the cat
tell you what it is?

126
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,516
'Cause the cat's
going to get it.

127
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,061
I'm sorry I'm not
as smart as you, Kirk.

128
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,521
We didn't all
go to Gudger college.

129
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,939
It's "Dignity!" Gahh!

130
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,276
Don't you even know
dignity when you see it?

131
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,277
Kirk, you're spitting.

132
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,278
Okay, genius,

133
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,030
why don't you draw dignity?

134
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,080
-(all exclaiming)
-Oh, that's dignity all right.

135
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,291
Worthy of Webster's.

136
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,335
It's no wonder
I can't draw dignity.

137
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,170
I gave it up
when I married her.

138
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,506
Now, Kirk,
it's only a game.

139
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,965
Sometimes, we--

140
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,384
Aw, cram it, churchy!

141
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,345
Maybe we should all have
a few drinks.

142
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,471
I'd have a drink,

143
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,889
but it might
loosen my tongue.

144
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,475
You want to talk?
Go ahead, Luann, talk.

145
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,976
Why don't you
tell them

146
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,395
one of your little
bedtime stories, huh?

147
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,230
Like the one about
how rotten it is

148
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,773
to be married
to a loser.

149
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,441
Or how about
the one about

150
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,777
how I carry a change purse?

151
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,195
Yeah, a purse!

152
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,571
Shut up and let the woman talk.

153
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,116
Okay, Kirk,
I'll tell a story.

154
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,659
It's about a man
whose father-in-law

155
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,328
gave him a sweet job as
manager of a cracker factory.

156
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,329
HOMER:
Boring.

157
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,956
A man whose complete lack

158
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,999
of business sense
and managerial impotence...

159
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,543
Ooh, here we go.

160
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,962
...sent the number-one
cracker factory in town

161
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:04,006
into a tie for sixth with
Tabletime and Allied Biscuit.

162
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,134
KIRK: You want to hear
a secret, everybody?

163
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,969
Luann loves it--
Loves it--

164
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,720
When I fail.

165
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,390
Oh, yes, Kirk, I love having to
borrow money from my sister.

166
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,810
I love having to steal clothes
from the church donation box.

167
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,728
Oh, sweet Jesus.

168
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,774
Lisa, why don't you
come sing for us?

169
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,151
<i>♪ You're a grand old flag... ♪</i>

170
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,194
Oh, great.
You got the kid singing.

171
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,821
I hope you're happy now.

172
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,156
I am not happy

173
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,992
and I haven't been happy
for a long time.

174
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,410
I want a divorce!

175
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,744
(all gasping)

176
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,833
A... divorce?

177
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,836
Sure. Divorce.

178
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,921
Hey, you got it,
toots

179
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,592
and here's a picture
even you can figure out.

180
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,136
It's a door! Use it!

181
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,554
That's a door?

182
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,392
Hello, I'm Doctor Hibbert.

183
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,480
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to amputate your butt.

184
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,856
(all laughing)

185
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,442
All right,
if you think you must.

186
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,819
Come on, Milhouse,
we are going.

187
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,738
Aw, can't I come home later?

188
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,072
There's not going to be
a home later.

189
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,491
Oh, okay.

190
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:15,453
Ta-ta, I'm off
to the beauty salon.

191
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,496
Good night.

192
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,872
Thanks for coming.

193
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,123
We'll see you.

194
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,458
Bye-bye.

195
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,835
Well, I think that
went pretty well.

196
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,880
(tires squealing)

197
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,051
What?

198
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,598
I feel terrible.

199
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,476
The Van Houtens
split up at our party.

200
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,644
Marge, please.

201
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,562
That was 20 minutes ago.

202
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,855
I shouldn't have served

203
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,690
those North Korean
fortune cookies.

204
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,318
They were so insulting:
"You are a coward."

205
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,904
No one likes to hear that
after a nice meal.

206
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,989
You can't keep
blaming yourself.

207
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,784
Just blame yourself
once and move on.

208
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,161
You know who the real
victim is in all of this--

209
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,412
Milhouse.

210
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:05,336
Hey, Van Houten,
I heard your folks broke up.

211
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,214
Aren't you going
to say, "Ha-ha"?

212
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,840
Oh, by no means.

213
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,342
My dad left my mom

214
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,262
after she got hooked
on cough drops.

215
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,139
By the end,
her breath was so fresh...

216
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,850
she wasn't really
my mother anymore.

217
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,018
Oh.

218
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,521
So I guess
I'm not alone.

219
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,106
Ah, you'll do fine.

220
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,316
My divorce was tough on my kid

221
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,401
but he got over it.

222
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,528
I sleep in a drawer.

223
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,407
<i>♪ I dig the nightlife ♪</i>

224
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,450
<i>♪ Got the boogie... ♪</i>

225
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,244
(humming)

226
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,752
I must say, Luann,
you're really

227
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,214
handling this
splendidly.

228
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,259
From now on, forget everything
you thought you knew

229
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,511
about Luann Van Houten.

230
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,762
Actually, Luann,
I don't really

231
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,888
know anything
about you.

232
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,640
Forget it.
She's gone.

233
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,392
Presto-chango!

234
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,602
Kaboom!

235
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,312
Sweet Fanny Adams!

236
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,438
Bye-bye!

237
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,400
Singles life
is great, homer.

238
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,402
I can do whatever I want.

239
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,779
Today I drank a beer
in the bathroom.

240
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,197
The one down the hall.

241
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,325
Yeah. And another great thing:

242
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,743
you get your own bed.

243
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,579
I sleep in a racing car.
Do you?

244
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,748
I sleep in a big bed
with my wife.

245
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,750
Oh. Yeah.

246
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,543
(knocking)

247
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,005
Hey, there, Kirk.

248
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,923
Oh, boy, what's going on?

249
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,258
Patio party?

250
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,010
No. A possum drowned
in the pool.

251
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,678
You have any garbage bags?

252
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,847
Uh, just throw it
over the fence.

253
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,182
Let Arby's worry about it.

254
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,808
That's Jerry.

255
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,353
He's a major player
down at the sewing store.

256
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,313
Well, thanks
for introducing me.

257
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,439
Oh, don't worry, Homer.

258
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,857
You know me

259
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,985
and I'm a superstar
at the cracker factory.

260
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,488
KIRK: You're letting me go?!

261
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,115
Kirk, crackers
are a family food.

262
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,659
Happy families.

263
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,703
Maybe single people
eat crackers; we don't know.

264
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,997
Frankly, we don't
want to know.

265
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,457
It's a market
we could do without.

266
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,917
So that's it--
After 20 years

267
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,251
so long, good luck?

268
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,670
I don't recall
saying good luck.

269
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,839
(imitating car engine)

270
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,593
And the winner
of the Milhouse 500 is...

271
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,346
Milhouse!

272
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,681
LUANN:
Milhouse, are you sure

273
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,599
you want
to drive that inside?

274
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,850
Yes.

275
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,769
Okay. Be careful,
sweet, sweet treasure.

276
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,728
(doorbell rings)

277
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,774
God, I missed you, Lu-Lu.

278
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,775
(giggles)

279
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,193
Chase...

280
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,612
It's only been three hours.

281
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,863
Who's Chase?

282
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,907
Oh. That's mom's
new boyfriend.

283
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,827
Hey, I know you
from American Gladiators.

284
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,120
You're Pyro!

285
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,788
Only on weekends.

286
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,331
During the week

287
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,125
I'm just your average
work-a-day stuntman.

288
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,167
Really?

289
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,503
Go ahead.
Break a chair on me.

290
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,796
(grunts)

291
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,840
Wow! Thanks.

292
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,675
Okay, boys,
I got to go.

293
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,468
Come on, Lu-Lu,
let's roll.

294
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,814
(whistling)

295
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,524
(yelling)

296
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,818
Ow! Gee. Ow!

297
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,695
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

298
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,697
Geez, sor-ry.

299
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,699
It's a pretty standard
stunt, Homer.

300
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,576
MARGE:
Homer, get ready!

301
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,702
For what?

302
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,495
Remember?
Luann and Chase

303
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,914
are taking us out
to hear Spalding Gray.

304
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,833
I don't want to go to that.

305
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,043
You said you'd do it
as a favor to me.

306
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,880
That doesn't sound
like something I'd say.

307
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,131
Fine. I'll go
without you.

308
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,758
Okay. Love ya.

309
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,766
Homer, I want you to meet
my new special lady.

310
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,059
Say hello to Starla.

311
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,770
(cigarette sizzling)

312
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,522
Can I have the keys
to the car, lover?

313
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,858
I feel like
changing wigs.

314
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,486
Okay.

315
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:02,281
Starla's a temp
at K-ZOG radio 530.

316
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,700
She's going to help me
launch my singing career.

317
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,868
(engine racing
and tires screeching)

318
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,827
My car!

319
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,750
Oh, my demo tape!

320
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,338
"Can I Borrow a Feeling?"

321
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,340
(laughing)

322
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,384
"Can I Borrow a Feeling?"

323
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,222
That's your picture
on the front.

324
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,973
Go ahead, Homer,
laugh at me.

325
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,391
I already did.

326
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,976
(sighs)

327
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,478
You know why
all this happened, don't you?

328
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,772
'Cause I took
my marriage for granted.

329
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,357
You know, in 12 years

330
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,567
I never once helped out
with the housework?

331
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,319
Oh, yeah,
you got to do that.

332
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,363
I could've at least
stayed in shape for her.

333
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,781
Oh, and for yourself.

334
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,491
I could've taken
just a little time

335
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,660
to make her feel special.

336
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,995
It can't just be sex.
It can't.

337
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,248
God, I was so self-centered.

338
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,999
No wonder
I didn't see it coming.

339
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,876
That's how it is, though.

340
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,420
One day your wife is
making you your favorite meal

341
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,756
the next day
you're thawing a hot dog

342
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,550
in a gas station sink.

343
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,844
Oh, that's tough, pal.

344
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,804
But it's never going
to happen to me.

345
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,264
Well, how do you know?

346
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,474
What makes you guys so special?

347
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,101
'Cause Marge and I
have one thing

348
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,853
that can never be broken:

349
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:19,024
A strong marriage built on
a solid foundation of routine.

350
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,901
Marge, I'm home.

351
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,069
Where are you?

352
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,029
Are you okay?

353
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,656
I don't smell dinner.

354
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,117
"Dear Homer..."
Aw.

355
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,911
"Sorry you didn't want
to join me tonight.

356
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,038
"I left you hot dogs
for dinner.

357
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,790
They're thawing in the sink."

358
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,211
(screams)

359
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,678
Hi, Dad.

360
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,638
You know, there's
buns in the cabinet.

361
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,890
Lisa, wait.

362
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,474
I know you're only
eight years old

363
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,351
and I don't want to put
a lot of pressure on you

364
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,478
but you've got
to save my marriage.

365
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,899
Oh. Okay.
Can I stay up?

366
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,400
Mmm... all right.

367
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,361
(clearing throat)

368
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,696
As you know,
there's been

369
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,573
a lot of talk
about divorce lately

370
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,284
and I think your mom
might not be happy with me.

371
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,161
You've done a lot of crazy stuff
over the years

372
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,329
and she stood by you.

373
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,122
Why would she
leave you now?

374
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,666
'Cause there's lots of stuff
she doesn't know about.

375
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,752
You mean, like your poker shack
out in the swamp?

376
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:20,753
Mm-hmm.

377
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:21,879
She knows.

378
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,380
Oh, I knew this would happen.

379
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,342
Our whole marriage started off
on the wrong foot.

380
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,511
MAN:
Dearly beloved, we are gathered

381
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,764
in the sight of God
and this casino to join...

382
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:32,765
Homer.

383
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,516
-And...
-Marge.

384
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,101
In holy matrimony.

385
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,395
By the power vested in me
by the state gaming commission

386
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,356
I pronounce you
man and wife.

387
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,607
Here's ten dollars
worth of chips.

388
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,359
You may kiss the bride.

389
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,318
Mm...

390
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,575
See?

391
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,410
You don't have to spend
a lot of money

392
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,579
to have a first-class
wedding reception.

393
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,831
(Marge sighing)

394
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,959
It's getting less
and less likely

395
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,211
you're going
to yell "Surprise"

396
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,129
and have all my
friends jump out.

397
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,631
"Levi's."

398
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,050
Hey, you think that truck
is full of jeans?

399
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,555
You're very lucky
to have mom.

400
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,520
That's your advice?
Go to bed.

401
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,442
Good morning.

402
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,819
You know, Marge,
I was thinking

403
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,571
about how much I enjoy
your interests

404
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,948
so I wandered over

405
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,200
to that theater
you went to last night

406
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,161
and I bought tickets
to their entire season.

407
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,456
Look, Mostly Madrigal.

408
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,834
Hey, that might be good.

409
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:45,004
Oh, oh, An Evening
with Philip Glass.

410
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,463
Just an evening?

411
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:51,510
Voices of
the Elderly Poor. Hmm...

412
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:55,222
Homey, I appreciate this

413
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,850
but I'd really like
to get some sleep.

414
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,393
Oh, of course, my sweet.

415
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,062
I'll just make some
soothing ocean sounds for you.

416
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,605
(blowing)

417
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:11,488
(imitates fog horn)

418
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,615
(squawking)

419
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,034
(inhales)

420
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,785
Arr, matey.

421
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,628
(humming)

422
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,465
Armando, don't you think
you're taking a lot off--

423
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,507
(screams)

424
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,342
Homer, what are you doing?

425
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,804
I wanted to surprise you
with a kicky summer do.

426
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,723
How many husbands would
do that for their wives?

427
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,059
None-- They'd have
more sense than that.

428
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,311
Ooh... you're feisty.

429
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,396
I'm going to give
you a Madonna cut.

430
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,773
Mmm! Homer

431
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,525
I don't need you around me
24 hours a day.

432
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,526
I'm a grown woman.

433
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,445
I can take care of myself.

434
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,031
Now will you please
just go away?

435
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,703
Oh... I just
made things worse.

436
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,997
A few clumsy gestures
aren't going to make up

437
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,582
for ten years of neglect.

438
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:07,628
Marge deserves someone
who will treat her right.

439
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,047
Marge deserves a fresh start.

440
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,595
I'd like to file for...

441
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,055
divorce.

442
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,060
These things happen.
Eight dollars.

443
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,687
Only three cavities, Bart.

444
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,397
Your best checkup ever.

445
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,399
I'm going to make
you my specialty--

446
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,567
Butterscotch chicken.

447
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,777
HOMER:
Marge?

448
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,529
Can you
come in here?

449
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,531
We need to talk.

450
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,664
ALL: Surprise!

451
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:44,665
(gasping)

452
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,668
Surprise.

453
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,131
Marge, will you
marry me?

454
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,174
Why, am I pregnant?

455
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,342
No.

456
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,678
It's a second wedding, honey.

457
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,639
Our first one was so crummy,
I had to make it up to you.

458
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,724
I really love you.

459
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,601
Oh, Homey.

460
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,103
I know you love me.

461
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,896
We don't need
to get married again.

462
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,189
Yes, we do.

463
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,150
I got us a divorce
this afternoon.

464
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,609
What?!

465
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,570
I didn't want
a hokey second wedding

466
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,446
like those ones on TV.

467
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,739
This one is for real.

468
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,616
I want our marriage
to be perfect

469
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,909
right from the start

470
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,287
so we don't end up
like Kirk and Luann.

471
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,122
We never will.

472
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,001
Dearly beloved--

473
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,502
Wait.

474
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,172
I want one last chance
to enjoy single life.

475
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,632
(belches)

476
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,633
Okay, ready.

477
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,634
I will now

478
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,636
read these special vows

479
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,098
which Homer has prepared
for this occasion.

480
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,850
"Do you, Marge, take Homer

481
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:48,770
in richness and in poorness,"
"Poorness" is underlined--

482
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,024
"In impotence and in potence

483
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,650
"In quiet solitude

484
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,403
"Or blasting across
the Alkali Flats

485
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,406
in a jet-powered,
monkey-navigated..."

486
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,741
And it goes on like this.

487
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,451
It doesn't matter.

488
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,203
All I want to know is

489
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,623
will you make me the luckiest guy
in the world...

490
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,957
again?

491
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,959
I will.

492
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,379
Oh, Homey,
of course I will.

493
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,423
