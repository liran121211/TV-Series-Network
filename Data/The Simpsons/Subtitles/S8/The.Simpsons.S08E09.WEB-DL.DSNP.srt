Well, don't look at me,

Oh, hi, Lenny.

No, why would I need

Lenny? Aw, well,
if it was big and annual

I'm sure they'd have
mentioned it in the newspaper.

Hey, Marge, you don't smoke.

30
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,509
Well, I just felt
like filling the house

31
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,512

-No, Homie, wait.
-What's wrong with you?

37

What are you trying
to hide from me?

38
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,566
(sniffing)
What's that smell?

39
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,113
Onions... chili powder...
cumin... juicy ground chuck!

40
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,864
It's chili! Oh, my God!

I'm missing the cook-off.

43
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,203
It's going on right now
and I'm missing it.

44
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,664
All right, I was trying
to keep it from you,

45
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,083
but I had a good reason.

46
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,501
Every time you go
to that cook-off

Oh, well, of course

54
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,644
everything looks bad
if you remember it.

55
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,771
Now, where are
my chili boots?

56
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,314

But I want you to promise me
you won't have any beer.

60
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,700
Okay, quit nagging me.
I won't have any beer.

61
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,660
Geez, why don't you have
a cigarette or something?

62
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,705
Mm, I suppose I could.

63
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,880
I'm gonna go get
some vegetarian chili

and add meat.

missing the chili.

to like handicrafts

74

much more than
stuffing my face.

Fine. I'll come find you

76
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,573
when I'm ready
to stop having fun.

77

no drinking.

I've added an extra ingredient

Wait, Mister.
You're drinking a candle.

139

You don't want to get wax
in your mouth, do you?

Want some more, do you?

150
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,972
Well, sure.
Heck, it's not my job

151
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,141
to talk people out of
killing themselves.

152
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,060

this can't be happening.

By all medical logic

159
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,242

out of his ears.

His ears if we're lucky.

00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,792
Well, Chief,
don't quit your day job--

00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,101
Mister, do you
need some help?

183
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,728
Let him go, Ralph.

184
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,854
He knows what he's doing.

185
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,607
(wailing)

186
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,031
(panting)

187
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,245
What's happening to me?

188
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,829
Okay, retrace your steps.

189
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,666
Woke up,
fought with Marge,

190
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,418
ate Guatemalan
insanity peppers.

191
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:08,047
Then I-- Ohh.

192
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,216
Where am I? Shelbyville?

193
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,676
(screams)

194
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,263
Man, this is crazy.

195
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,807
I hope I didn't brain my damage.

196
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,684
I better check my pupils.

197
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,610
(hissing)

198
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,073
Oh... kay.

199
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:37,201
I think I'm gonna be
leaving now.

200
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,125
Huh?

201
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,631
Sunrise, sunset...

202
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,800
Sunrise, sunset...

203
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,303
Sunrise, sunset,
sunrise, sunset,

204
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,929
sunrise, sunset, sunrise...

205
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,389
(screams)

206
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:02,351
Note to self:
Stop doing anything.

207
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,606
Has anyone seen Homer?

208
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,190
Marge, better
you hear it from me

209
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,942
than some gossipy neighbor.

210
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,944
Homer made a total
jackass of himself.

211
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,780
Oh, Helen, that's enough.
Call off your dogs.

212
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,741
But someone had
to tell her.

213
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,117
And I got here first.

214
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,703
-Helen, zip it.
-Oh please. Tim.

215
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,955
Zip it. Ziparoo.

216
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,248
No beer, huh?

217
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,958
(grumbling)

218
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,837
I guess I know what a promise
from Homer J. Simpson is worth.

219
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,638
Hey, buddy, get back there
with the other rocks.

220
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,098
Huh?

221
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,808
A tortoise?

222
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,186
"Follow... the..."

223
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,355
(gasps)
This must be why I'm here!

224
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,398
Follow the what?
Follow the what?

225
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,400
Hurry up!

226
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,988
Get moving you stupid--

227
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,867
When I'm kicking you,
that means hurry up.

228
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,952
Come on.

229
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,051
Oh, you want me
to climb that, huh?

230
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,136
No problemo.

231
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,097
(rumbling)

232
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,725
Oh!

233
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,811
This is 'cause I kicked you,
isn't it?

234
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,523
(grunting)

235
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,984
Lis, check it out.

236
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,320
I saw it, Bart.

237
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,863
You're just mad

238
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:38,906
'cause there's
no clock in your hat.

239
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,491
What hat?

240
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,285
Ah, this baby's wasted
on an idiot like you.

241
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,912
Where's Homer?

242
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,372
Your father decided
that he'd rather come home

243
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,375
in a taxi... or a police car.

244
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,335
(grunting)

245
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,339
(gasping)

246
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,299
Marge, thank God
you're here.

247
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,467
Where's the car?

248
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,971
Marge? Marge?

249
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,639
Oh, now what?

250
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,143
If you're still mad at me,
I'm gonna be really mad.

251
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,644
Come on, Marge,
will you..?

252
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,480
Fight fair.
I never do this to you.

253
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,107
Talk to me!

254
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,068
(wind blowing)

255
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,826
Oh, I hate this place.

256
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,745
Why am I here?

257
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,205
VOICE: <i>You are on</i>
<i>a quest for knowledge.</i>

258
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,165
Who said that?

259
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,468
Fear not, Homer.

260
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,136
I am your spirit guide.

261
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,304
Hiya.

262
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,306
There is a lesson
you must learn.

263
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,725
If it's about laying off
the insanity peppers

264
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,768
I'm way ahead of you.

265
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,020
No, I speak of a deeper wisdom.

266
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,022
The problem, Homer,

267
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,357
is that the mind is
always chattering away

268
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,651
with a thousand thoughts
at once.

269
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,862
Yeah, that's me all right.

270
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,822
(wind blowing)

271
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,160
Clarity is the path
to inner peace.

272
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,454
Well, what should I do?
Should I meditate?

273
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,748
Should I get rid
of all my possessions?

274
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,125
Are you kidding?!
(chuckles)

275
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,503
If anything, you should
get more possessions.

276
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,296
You don't even have
a computer.

277
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,925
You know, I have been meaning
to take a spiritual journey

278
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,301
and I--

279
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,719
(growling)

280
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,679
Hey, knock it off!

281
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,598
Sorry.

282
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,350
I am a coyote.

283
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,018
Look, just give me
some inner peace

284
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,520
or I'll mop the floor
with you.

285
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,564
Good. Your mind is in
a state of readiness.

286
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,316
So listen well.

287
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,819
To make yourself complete,

288
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,487
you must find your soul mate.

289
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,988
Soul mate?

290
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,241
Your kindred spirit.

291
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,701
The one with whom you share
an unspoken bond,

292
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,496
a profound mystical
understanding.

293
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,414
That's it?

294
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,333
Well, that's Marge.
Big deal.

295
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,169
Great spiritual quest,
Wolfie.

296
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,505
My soul mate is Marge.

297
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,257
Is it?

298
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,807
Hey wait. Come back.

299
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,058
Oh.

300
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,852
(horn blowing)

301
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,270
Oh! A ghost train!

302
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,397
And so little time
to get out of the way.

303
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,439
Now less...

304
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,108
Now none!
(screams)

305
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,442
D'oh!

306
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,655
Hey, get off the course,
you bum!

307
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,156
Security.

308
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,533
(whistle blowing)

309
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,119
Wha-- Golf course?

310
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,746
Did I dream that whole thing?

311
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,833
Maybe the desert
was just a sand trap.

312
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,293
Oh, and I bet

313
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,963
that crazy pyramid
was just the Pro Shop.

314
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,174
And that talking coyote
was really just a talking dog.

315
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,634
Hi, Homer.
Find your soul mate.

316
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,136
Hey, wait a minute.

317
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,430
There's no such thing
as a talking dog.

318
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,848
(barking)

319
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,266
Damn straight.

320
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,059
So then I says to Mabel,
I says--

321
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,227
Hi, kids.

322
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,478
I'll finish this later.
Hi Dad.

323
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,731
-Where is your mother?
-Out back.

324
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,900
So anyway,
I says to Mabel, I says--

325
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,026
Hi, honey.

326
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,947
(singsongy)
Oh, I guess you're cranky

327
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,450
because I didn't
come home last night.

328
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,453
I'm "cranky" because
my husband got drunk

329
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,414
and humiliated me
in front of the entire town.

330
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,334
You broke
your promise, Homer.

331
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,419
Oh, honey,
I didn't get drunk.

332
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,047
I just went to a strange
fantasy world.

333
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,965
Come on, you got
to believe me.

334
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,216
You're my soul mate.

335
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,260
Don't "soul mate" me!

336
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,887
Okay.

337
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,889
(snoring)

338
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:35,684
That coyote said my soul mate
would understand me

339
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,145
but Marge doesn't understand me
at all.

340
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,855
Maybe we're not kindred spirits.

341
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,859
We don't have
anything in common.

342
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,487
Look at these records.

343
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,657
Jim Nabors, Glen Campbell,
The Doodletown Pipers.

344
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,533
Now look at her records.

345
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,452
They stink!

346
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:57,039
Oh. Maybe I had
that crazy dream for a reason.

347
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,170
Wherever my soul mate is,
it's not here.

348
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,723
I always just figured
my wife was my soul mate,

349
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,351
but if it's not Marge,
then who is it?

350
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,061
Where do I begin looking?

351
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,729
This really goes
beyond my training

352
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,564
as a furniture
salesman, sir.

353
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,149
Now, if you
don't want the sofa

354
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,609
I'll have to ask you
to leave.

355
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:32,157
Hey, Barney, soul mate,
let me buy you a beer.

356
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,410
Okay, but I'm not
your soul mate.

357
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,328
I'm really more
of a chum.

358
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,288
-What about you, Lenny?
-I'm a crony.

359
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,873
-Carl?
-I'd say acquaintance.

360
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,500
-Colleague.
-Sympathizer.

361
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,543
-Compadre.
-Associate.

362
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,711
Contemporary.

363
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,129
I'm a well-wisher

364
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,881
in that I don't wish you
any specific harm.

365
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,591
(sighs)

366
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,512
Hello? Is this, uh...

367
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,847
G.B.M.?

368
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,891
Uh, yeah.
I read in the personals

369
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,518
you were seeking a soul mate.

370
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,563
Well, I also like
rainy days and movies.

371
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,565
Uh-huh.

372
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:09,778
Uh... no...
I don't like that...

373
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,572
or that.

374
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,906
No, it's not that I'm afraid.

375
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,034
I'm gonna hang up now.
Bye-bye.

376
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,744
Oh... I give up.

377
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,121
COYOTE:
<i>Find your soul mate, Homer.</i>

378
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,706

00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,003
Huh?

393
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,214
What's that blinking light?

394
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,465
(gasps)

395
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,092
The lighthouse keeper.

396
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,345
The loneliest man in the world.

397
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,846
He'll understand me.

398
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,435
(panting)

399
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,606
Earl.

400
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,650
My new friend's name is Earl.

401
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,610
Here I come, buddy!

402
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,321
No more loneliness
for Homer and Earl.

403
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,868
A machine?

404
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,246
Earl's a machine?

405
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,624
Oh, that's just perfect.

406
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:49,253
Homer's desperate search
for a soul mate has yielded

407
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,505
a lighthouse-keeping robot.

408
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,132
Oh, wow.

409
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,510
Hey, look, is that Dad?

410
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,638
Either that or Batman's
really let himself go.

411
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,515
Alone.

412
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,100
Oh, I'm alone.

413
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,310
I'm a lonely,
insignificant speck

414
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,814
on a has-been planet orbited
by a cold, indifferent sun.

415
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,232
(horn blows)

416
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,192
A ship.

417
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,652
A ship with people.

418
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,654
I know.
I'll bring them to me.

419
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,739
And then they'll
have to be my friends.

420
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,702
Come here, people.

421
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,829
(laughing)

422
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,790
Arr, matey.

423
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,293
Nary a warning
light to be seen.

424
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,129
'Tis clear sailing ahead
for our precious cargo.

425
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,756
Uh... would that be
the hot pants, sir?

426
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,508
Aye, the hot pants.

427
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,759
(giggling)

428
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,762
Well, I won't be lonely
for long.

429
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,390
(giggling hysterically)

430
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,728
(footsteps approaching)

431
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,188
Huh? Who's there?

432
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,524
Oh, Homer, thank
goodness you're safe.

433
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,109
-Marge?
-I woke up,

434
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,320
and you weren't there,
and I was so worried.

435
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,905
Really? You were?

436
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,282
But how did you find me?

437
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,910
Well... I was sure
you'd be on foot

438
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,244
because you always say

439
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,747
public transportation
is for losers,

440
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,665
and I was sure you'd head west

441
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,627
because Springfield
slopes down that way,

442
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,545
and then I saw the lighthouse,

443
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,840
and I remembered
how you love blinking lights--

444
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,926
like the one on
the waffle iron.

445
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,137
Or that little guy on
the "don't walk" sign.

446
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,764
-Yeah.
-Wow, Marge,

447
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,599
you really
do understand me.

448
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,768
See, I thought we weren't
soul mates because--

449
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,019
We had a fight?

450
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,854
Right, and we don't like
the same things.

451
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,065
-It's like you're from Venus--
-And you're from Mars.

452
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,859
Oh sure, give me the one
with all the monsters.

453
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,861
Homer, don't you see?

454
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,489
Our differences are
only skin deep.

455
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,117
But our sames go
right down to the bone.

456
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,494
Maybe we do have--

457
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,330
A profound mystical
understanding?

458
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,499
Hey. We do!

459
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,960
Oh, Marge!

460
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,712
We're number one!
We're number one!

461
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,006
In your face, space coyote.

462
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,299
Space coyote?

463
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,051
-(horn blowing)
-Oh, my God!

464
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,595
-The ship!
-We'll all be killed!

465
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,846
The light.

466
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,139
We got to get
the light back on.

467
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,066
Jonathan Livingston
Seagull!

468
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,567
We're on
a collision course!

469
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,735
Hard a-starboard!

470
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,820
Uh, port?

471
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,697
Aye, port.

472
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,782
They see us.

473
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,243
They're starting
to turn.

474
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,911
We did it.

475
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,830
We sure did...

476
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,790
soul mate.

477
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,709
