00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,928
Wow, man, what
is this place?

182
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,847
I prefer not
to be called "Man."

183
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,390
My name is Belle

184
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,935
and this is
the Maison Derriere.

185
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,479
That means the, uh,
"Back house."

186
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,688
Are you having a party
or something?

187
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,023
Nonstop.

188
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,775
We're a burlesque house--

189
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,694
A private club where gentlemen
can play some cards

190
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,737
and see a show.

191
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,405
Miss Belle,

192
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,282
we're about to do our
"Around the World" number,

193
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,868
but Monte Carlo 
can't find her dice.

194
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,370
Here you go, darlin'.

195
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,247
Normally, we don't allow
children in here

196
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,666
but your father
was so insistent.

197
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,792
He's tough but fair.

198
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,752
I'll start sorting these bras.

199
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,171
That's a bit advanced
for you.

200
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,756
But I know
a stopped-up sink

201
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,132
that needs
some attention.

202
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,301
Just glad to be on the team.

203
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,428
BELLE:
When you work the door

204
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,430
the main things are
to greet the visitors

205
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,848
and toss out
the troublemakers.

206
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,517
Oh, the ol' greet 'n' toss.

207
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,685
No <i>problemo.</i>

208
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,770
How did I ever get along
without you?

209
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,067
(whistling)

210
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,279
Oop.

211
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,992
Is your name Bart?

212
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,578
-Mm-hmm.
-What the--

213
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,663
Does your father know
you're working here?

214
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,956
It was his idea.

215
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,374
In that case
I'll have a whiskey sour.

216
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,670
Oh, there's something
unsatisfying

217
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,255
about scrubbing
these rocks

218
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,466
and I think I know
what it is.

219
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,927
Lisa, I know
it's frustrating

220
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,597
but we made a commitment
and we have to see it through

221
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,391
no matter how unpleasant.

222
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,892
Quitting time. Okay.

223
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,520
Scrub up and head
for the communal tarp.

224
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,314
We're having
kelpburgers

225
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,649
and we're going to watch
a tape of Johnny Arvik.

226
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,276
He's the eskimo comedian.

227
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,823
Faster, Mom, faster.

228
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,454
Oh, that was
our emcee, Mel Zetz.

229
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,248
He got out of bed too fast
and broke his hip.

230
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,459
So who's going to warm up
the crowd tonight?

231
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,586
Well, whoever fits
Mel's tuxedo.

232
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,754
Eep!

233
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,339
The jokes are in
the breast pocket.

234
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,840
If you get in trouble,

235
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,175
there's a switch
that makes the bow tie spin.

236
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,847
"Heh, nudist colonies
are everywhere these days.

237
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,557
"I'd love to go, but I--

238
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,435
I can't get the wrinkles
out of my birthday suit."

239
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,188
(raucous laughter)

240
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,814
"But I got to tell you,

241
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,567
"Adam and Eve must have been
the first bookkeepers.

242
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,944
They invented
the loose leaf system."

243
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,238
(raucous laughter)

244
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,657
(chuckling)

245
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,949
If there's
a bad bookkeeping joke

246
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,785
I haven't heard it.

247
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,578
ANNOUNCER:
<i>It's 11:00.</i>

248
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,622
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>where your children are?</i>

249
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,291
I told you
last night, no!

250
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,669
Where is Bart anyway?

251
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,796
His dinner's getting
all cold and eaten.

252
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,427
Bart, where are you?

253
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,304
Come on!

254
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,598
I have to be up at 6:00 a.m.
to swipe Flanders' newspaper.

255
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,600
What the--

256
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,894
"President Eisenhower
celebrates

257
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,896
"40th wedding anniversary.

258
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,857
Not pictured, Mrs. Eisenhower."

259
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,858
I'm sorry.

260
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,527
This is all my fault.

261
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,945
Bart was filling in--

262
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,531
I don't care if he
was filling for Mel Zetz.

263
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,700
He's my son and I don't
want him working...

264
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,661
so... late... that...

265
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,954
Oh, I agree.

266
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,747
Kids need rules
and boundaries.

267
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,750
Yes, everyone
loves rules.

268
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,502
It's so tough to be
a parent these days

269
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,255
what with all the gangs
and the drugs...

270
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,549
Oh, yeah, drugs.
You gotta have drugs.

271
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,175
Hey, he didn't pay the cover.

272
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,428
Oh, Bart,
he's your father.

273
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,595
We'll comp him
tonight.

274
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,847
Start a tab
tomorrow.

275
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,394
Oh, I hope I didn't miss
the floor show.

276
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,729
-Nope.
-Is Roxanne back?

277
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,896
Yup.

278
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,148
Did she, uh,
get my flowers?

279
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,650
-She did.
-I--

280
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,943
Hello, Bart.

281
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,778
Hello,
Principal Skinner.

282
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,865
This is the National Air
and Space Museum, isn't it?

283
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,450
(doorbell rings)

284
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,913
Uh, this isn't going to be
about Jesus, is it?

285
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,915
All things
are about Jesus, Homer.

286
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,500
Except this.

287
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,712
Your son has been working
in a burlesque house.

288
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,381
Principal Skinner
saw him with his own eyes.

289
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,467
That's true,
but I was only in there

290
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,510
to get directions on how
to get away from there.

291
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,387
Helen,
as a responsible parent

292
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,514
I was already
well aware of that.

293
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,017
Homer, I'm as permissive
as the next parent.

294
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,311
I mean, just yesterday
I let Todd buy some red hots

295
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,146
with a cartoon
devil on the box

296
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,398
but you can't possibly
think it's appropriate

297
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,358
for your ten-year-old son

298
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,943
to work in
a burlesque house.

299
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,654
Oh, no?
Well, if Homer Simpson

300
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,115
wants his ten-year-old son
working in a burlesque house,

301
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,242
then Homer Simpson's 
ten-year-old son

302
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,661
is going to work
in a burlesque house!

303
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,704
That...

304
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,789
(nervous laugh)

305
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,540
Hi.

306
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,460
Now, Marge, you're gonna hear
a lot of crazy talk

307
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,796
about Bart working
in a burlesque house...

308
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,510
"Maison Derriere"?

309
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,428
I can't believe
there's a place

310
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,348
like that in our
wholesome little town.

311
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,225
Homer, did you know it
was a burlesque house

312
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,851
when you sent Bart
to work there?

313
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,270
No. I only learned that
four days ago.

314
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:37,024
What were you thinking sending
Bart to such an awful place?

315
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:41,487
I was trying to punish him
exactly like you would.

316
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,822
So, in a way

317
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,657
you really dropped 
the ball on this one.

318
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,158
This is your mess

319
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,494
and I'll be damned
if I'm gonna clean it up.

320
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,705
(grumbles)

321
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,582
Please come in,
Mrs. Simpson.

322
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,918
How can I be of service?

323
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,254
I have a favor to ask.

324
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,964
Please shut
this place down

325
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,799
and move away
from Springfield.

326
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,634
Oh, honey,
you can't be serious.

327
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,845
Springfield doesn't
want places like this.

328
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,222
I think I know what
Springfield wants, sugar.

329
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:12,351
Oh? I've lived in this town
for 37 years.

330
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,019
I've lived here 52 years.

331
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,063
-I'm third generation.
-Sixth.

332
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,440
Get out of my town!

333
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,235
Listen, darling, we're just
as much a part of Springfield

334
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,530
as the church, the library
or the crazy house,

335
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,950
so I think I'll stay
right here... neighbor.

336
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,451
Is that so?

337
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,705
Well, sleazy entertainment
and raunchy jokes

338
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:36,834
will never be as popular
as sobriety and self-denial.

339
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,419
You're about to learn

340
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,004
the two most
dangerous words

341
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,424
in the English language
are "Marge Simpson."

342
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,219
It's the light
pink '87 wagon.

343
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,014
And after visiting
the area for, uh,

344
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,640
the past two months

345
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,143
I have determined it is
not feasible to construct

346
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,354
a super-train between
Springfield and Aruba.

347
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,981
(dejected groaning)

348
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,817
Next on the agenda is, uh...

349
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,069
The Citizens' Committee
on Moral Hygiene.

350
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,821
(dejected groaning)

351
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,160
I'm here to share
my moral outrage

352
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,703
but this time it's not about

353
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,830
that giant inflatable
Dos Equis bottle.

354
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,042
It's about a certain house
in our town.

355
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,085
What's wrong with this house?
Is it the plumbing?

356
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:25,841
No. It's a house of ill fame,
a house of loose ethics.

357
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,885
Is there a building code
violation?

358
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:28,928
A drainage issue?

359
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,012
A surveying error?

360
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,056
The house is perfectly fine.

361
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,766
Well, then quit bad-mouthing
the house.

362
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,893
Yeah. Leave
the house alone.

363
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,813
Oh, geez, it's what's inside
the house that's disgraceful--

364
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,524
Drinking, gambling
and debauchery.

365
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,778
It's right under our noses--
A secret house

366
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,154
of burlesque.

367
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,864
(gasping)

368
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,865
-Oh, my.
-MARGE: That's right.

369
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,158
KARL: That's not good.

370
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,619
People, this is an issue
that we as a town

371
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,204
are strong enough to ignore.

372
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,082
Let us give no more scrutiny
to this bawdy house

373
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,918
and its small clientele
of loyal perverts.

374
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,711
Oh, I'm afraid
this problem

375
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,255
goes far beyond
Eugene and Rusty.

376
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,508
(quiet murmuring)

377
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,093
Marge, if you please.

378
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,764
Julius!

379
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,433
Clancy!

380
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,143
CHALMERS:
Skinner?

381
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,104
-Seymour!
-Mother...

382
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,981
SELMA:
Patty?

383
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:22,982
WOMAN:
Cletus!

384
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,444
Oh. Uh, Barney.

385
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,780
Clancy!

386
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,407
Hey, come on!
You did me twice!

387
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,868
Smithers?

388
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,413
My parents insisted
I give it a try, sir.

389
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,956
HELEN LOVEJOY:
Mayor Quimby!

390
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,625
Uh, well, that could be
any mayor.

391
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,544
I rest my case.

392
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,797
Er, uh, well...
In light of these new facts,

393
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,216
of which I now realize
I was largely aware,

394
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,968
I must take action.

395
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:54,304
All in favor of demolishing
our beloved burlesque house

396
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,806
raise your hands.

397
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,271
(Marge clears throat)

398
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,690
Are they talking
about the bordello?

399
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,943
No, the burlesque house,
so just keep your mouth shut.

400
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,991
(mob grumbling)

401
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,953
Oh, there's no justice
like angry-mob justice.

402
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,080
I'm going to burn
all the historic memorabilias.

403
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,124
I'm going to take
me home a toilet.

404
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,709
Well, there'd
better be two.

405
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,879
(doorbell rings)

406
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,297
BELLE:
<i>Who is it?</i>

407
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,631
Uh, it's an angry mob,
ma'am.

408
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,800
Could you step outside
for a twinkle

409
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,302
while we knock down
your house?

410
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,720
<i>Just a minute.</i>

411
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,521
Stand aside, you degenerate,
two-bit proprietress.

412
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,066
Don't you call me that.
I'm an entrepreneuse.

413
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,860
Oh, shut up. You're wasting
valuable smashing time.

414
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,361
(yelling)

415
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,075
(glass shattering)

416
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,743
Dad, we can't let
this happen to Belle.

417
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,827
Do something.

418
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,828
Don't you worry, son.

419
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,248
My friends!

420
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,374
Stop!

421
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,753
Please hurry.

422
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,839
Sure. We could tear
this house down--

423
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,174
-(yelling)
-Yeah! Oh, yeah!

424
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,177
No! My friends, stop!

425
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,428
Let me finish.

426
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,722
We could tear it down

427
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:23,852
but we'd be tearing down

doing, Marge?

hear the song?

00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,826
No. I had to go rent
the bulldozer.

479
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,954
Well, we all
changed our minds.

480
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,830
Yeah. Now we
love the house.

It was a very
convincing song, Marge.

Mm-hmm. There were
kicks and everything.

484
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,506
Hmm... Can you sing it again?

I'm sorry.

spur-of-the-moment-type things.

487

Well, I also have
a song to sing.
