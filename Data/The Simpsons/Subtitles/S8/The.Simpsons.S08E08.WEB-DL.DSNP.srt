There's no record of a hurricane
ever hitting Springfield.

20
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,449
Yes, but the records

Sir,
for your own safety,

54
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,839
we do advise you
to evacuate.

55
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,132

Sure. Let's go.

60
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,568
Well,
need some help there?

61
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,944
You know, maybe you folks
should come over

62
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,321
and hunker in our bunker.

00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,198
Oh, it'll be fun.

old canceled checks and receipts

65
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,410
and give ourselves
an audit--

66
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,786
Make sure we don't owe
anything extra.

67
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,538

No, siree. We'd be happy
as hens to have you--

70
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,921
I would make it my business
to be a third wheel.

If baby Jesus got loose

74
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,636

If you stop this hurricane

we will be forever grateful

112
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,845
and recommend you
to all our friends.

113
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,514
So if you could find it
in your infinite wisdom to--

114
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,640
Wait.

I'm right here, Daddy.

it was terrifying.

00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,649

Well, sir,
everyone's alive.

140

Guess that's something
to be thankful for.

141
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,448
Now, that kind
of attitude's

142
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,117
not going to get
your house back.

143
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,411
I'm sure your insurance
will cover the house.

144
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,287
Uh, well, no.

145
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,415
Neddy doesn't
believe in insurance.

146
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,208
He considers it
a form of gambling.

147
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,584
You know,
it's kind of funny.

148
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,044
The only thing
that survived the storm

149
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,004
were the family
tombstones.

150
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,798
They're all
we have left.

151
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,008
Well, call us
if you need anything.

152
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,016
We got new clothes
from the donation bin!

153
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,643
I'm a surfer!

154
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,311
Look, Daddy,
Todd is stupid

155
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,063
and I'm with him.

156
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,399
And now Mommy's stupid.
(laughs)

157
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,443
Looking good, Rod.

00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,570

160
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,825
Neddy, I know this has
been a terrible day

161

but, by golly,

00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,498
Aren't you being
a tad melodramatic, Ned?

182
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,459
Also, I believe Job
was right-handed.

183
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,793
But, Reverend,
I need to know.

184
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,254
Is God punishing me?

185
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,424
Ooh... Short answer:
"Yes" with an "If."

186
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,385
Long answer:
"No" with a "But."

187
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,804
Uh, if you need additional
solace, by the way,

188
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,389
I've got a copy
of something or other

189
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,766
by Art Linkletter
in my office.

190
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,821
Even in my darkest hour,

191
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,533
I can turn
to the good book for...

192
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,576
Son of a gun-diddily-un!

193
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,703
Those gilded edges smart.

194
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,582
Why me, Lord?

195
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,084
Where have I gone wrong?

196
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,919
I've always been nice to people.

197
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,629
I don't drink or dance or swear.

198
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,048
I've even kept kosher
just to be on the safe side.

199
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,467
I've done everything
the Bible says--

200
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,678
Even the stuff that contradicts
the other stuff.

201
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,388
What more could I do?

202
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:18,558
I--I feel like
I'm coming apart here.

203
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,434
I want to yell out,
but I--I just can't

204
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,604
dang-diddily-do-dang-do-don-
diddily-darn do it.

205
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,981
I--I--I...

206
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,357
(sighs)

207
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,612
Ned! Maude!

208
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,364
You've got to go back
to your house!

209
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,491
Something incredible
has happened!

210
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,617
Oh, what happened now?

211
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,827
Did the rubble burn down?

212
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,579
No! Come on!

213
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,627
CROWD:
Yay!

214
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,045
(gasps)

215
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,630
Oh, they rebuilt
our house.

216
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,133
Oh! It's a miracle.

217
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,469
I started making some calls last night,
and before I knew it,

218
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,805
practically all of Springfield
was offering to help.

219
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:01,058
-Mm-hmm. My pleasure.
-Happy to help.

220
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,935
-Fabulous experience.
-Sure!

221
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,437
Hope you like it,
neighbor.

222
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,688
We didn't have the best tools

223
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,440
or all the know-how,

224
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,484
but we did have
a wheelbarrow full of love.

225
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,486
And a cement mixer
full of hope

226
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,613
and some cement.

227
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,448
Oh, it's wonderful.

228
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:19,035
I--I--I... I don't know
how I can possibly repay you

229
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,578
but if any of you
ever need a favor

230
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:24,582
just look for the happiest man
in Springfield.

231
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,334
No, no, not me, friends.

232
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,045
He's talking about himself,
but thanks for looking.

233
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,345
(cheering)

234
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,513
The living room
and dining rooms

235
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,849
with a lovely flow
for entertaining...

236
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,059
-Uh-huh.
-(shirt rips)

237
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,311
And-- Oh!
Looks like a loose nail.

238
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,438
Eh, one out of 25
ain't bad.

239
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,108
Your beautiful
kitchen, Ned.

240
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,985
Just as you
remember it.

241
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,905
Was that, uh...

242
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,115
Was that toilet always
next to the refrigerator?

243
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,659
Uh, Ned,

244
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,078
you ever try lugging a toilet
up a flight of stairs?

245
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,080
Lisa and I built
your room.

246
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,040
But I don't like this clown.

247
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,500
Uh, I wouldn't
take it down

248
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,626
if I were you.

249
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:09,710
It's a load-bearing
poster.

250
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,003
(ceiling cracking)

251
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,592
(electricity buzzing)

252
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,886
Now, this is a room
with electricity

253
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,180
but it has
too much electricity.

254
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,348
So I don't know.

255
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,516
You might want
to wear a hat.

256
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,892
Uh-huh.

257
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,687
The floor feels
a little gritty here.

258
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,522
Yeah. We ran out
of floorboards there

259
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,856
so we painted the dirt.

260
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,525
Pretty clever!

261
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,446
Oh! Something is definitely
wrong with this hallway!

262
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:39,699
Come on in!

263
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,493
It's your master bedroom!

264
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,619
Ow! My nose!

265
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,746
Well, I've seen about enough.

266
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,581
So, Flanders,

267
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,543
what do you think
of the house that love built?

268
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,257
Aw, shoot!

269
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,509
(sighs)

270
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,555
(huffing)

271
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,556
(lens cracks)

272
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,433
Aww...

273
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,769
Now calm down, Neddily-diddily-
diddily-diddily-diddily.

274
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,731
They did their best,
shoddily-iddily-iddily-diddily.

275
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,608
Got to be nice--
Hostility-ilitity-bility-dility.

276
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,944
Aw, hell,
diddily-ding-dong crap!

277
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,447
Can't your morons
do anything right?!

278
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,158
-(crowd gasping)
-Hey!

279
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,660
Ned, we meant well,

280
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,370
and everyone here
tried their best.

281
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,788
Well, my family and I

282
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,249
can't live in good
intentions, Marge!

283
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,168
Oh, your family
is out of control

284
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,586
but we can't blame you

285
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,756
because you have
good intentions.

286
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:37,798
Hey, back off, man!

287
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,634
Oh, okay, dude.

288
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,970
I wouldn't want you
to have a cow, man.

289
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,346
Here's a catchphrase

290
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,890
you better learn
for your adult years.

291
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,516
Hey, buddy,
got a quarter?

292
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,769
(all gasping and murmuring)

293
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,270
I am shocked and appalled.

294
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,439
Mr. Flanders,
with all due respect

295
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,065
Bart didn't do anything.

296
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,109
(gasps) Do I hear the sound
of butting in?

297
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,069
It's got to be
little Lisa Simpson,

298
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,697
Springfield's answer
to a question no one asked!

299
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,783
-(goofy laughing)
-What do we have here?

300
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,785
The long, flabby arm
of the law?

301
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,661
The last case
you got to the bottom of

302
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,789
was a case of Mallomars!

303
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,374
Mallomars.
Oh, that's going in the act.

304
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,835
Oh, yeah, the clown,

305
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,045
the only one
of you buffoons

306
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,588
who doesn't
make me laugh.

307
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,048
And as for you,
I don't know you,

308
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,674
but I'm sure
you're a jerk!

309
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,051
Hey, I've only been here
a few minutes.

310
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,093
What's going on?

311
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,679
You ugly,
hate-filled man.

312
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:30,226
Hey, hey, I may be ugly
and hate-filled, but I, um...

313
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,727
What was the third thing
you said?

314
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,481
Homer...

315
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,525
you are the worst human being

316
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,611
I have ever met.

317
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,196
Hey, I got off pretty easy.

318
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,989
(crowd murmuring)

319
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,367
Neddy? Uh, wait.

320
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,827
Where you going?

321
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,578

00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:57,044

327
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,319
just for trying to help me.

328
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,988
I'd like
to commit myself.

329
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,030
Very well.

330
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,407
Shall I show you to your room,

331
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,616
or would you prefer
to be dragged off

332
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,118
kicking and screaming?

333
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,203
Ooh, kicking and screaming,
please.

334
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,914
As you wish.

335
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:40,004
(screaming)

336
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,468
Flanders?

337
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,636
Ned Flanders?

338
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,141
I'd better call Dr. Foster.

339
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,143
(ringing)

340
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,395
Yes, Dr. Foster here.

341
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,730
Ned Flanders?

342
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,440
You're sure?

343
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,567
No, no, no,
I'll come right over.

344
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,404
And may God have mercy
on us all.

345
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,197
Darling, there's an emergency
at the hospital.

346
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,365
Where are my shoes?

347
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,367
Oh, I think
they're in the den.

348
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,869
In the den?

349
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,538
May God have mercy
on us all.

350
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,251
Well, how are you feeling
this evening?

351
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,586
Uh...

352
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,962
actually,
I'm a little chilly.

353
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,047
Can I have another straitjacket?

354
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,465
Of course.

355
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,051
Thank you.

356
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,552
Dr. Foster!

357
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,932
Hmm... Well, at least
your memory is not crazy.

358
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,433
Now, Ned,
you may remember

359
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,186
we spent some time
together 30 years ago.

360
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,605
Do you recall what you
were like back then?

361
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,816
-Oh, sure. I was a good little boy.
-Were you?

362
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,784
<i>Whee! I'm Dick Tracy!</i>

363
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,078
<i>Bam! Take that, Prune-Face!</i>

364
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,454
<i>Now I'm Prune-Face.</i>

365
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,580
<i>Take that, Dick Tracy!</i>

366
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,165
<i>Now I'm Prune Tracy.</i>

367
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,208
<i>Take that, Dick...</i>

368
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,584
<i>Ned, stop it at once!</i>

369
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,629
<i>-Stop it!</i>
-(film flapping)

370
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,298
I can't believe
I was such a terror.

371
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,008
Well, neither
could your parents.

372
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,843
That's why they brought you
to me.

373
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:15,140
Well, I'm afraid young Ned
is unusually aggressive

374
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,518
but I can't seem
to find a cause for it.

375
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,686
Hey, hey!

376
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,604
Get down
from that bookshelf, please.

377
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,481
Most of those books
haven't been discredited yet.

378
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,441
Would you please
tell your son to stop?

379
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,193
We can't do it, man.

380
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,486
That's discipline.

381
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,238
That's like
telling Gene Krupa

382
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,824
not to go boom, boom,
bap-bap-bap, boom, boom!

383
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,993
(imitating drumming)

384
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,494
Boom! Boom! Tiss!

385
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,496
Hmm... Lack of discipline.

386
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,123
I'm beginning
to see the problem.

387
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,833
We don't believe in rules.

388
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,918
Like, we gave them up

389
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,879
when we starting living
like freaky beatniks.

390
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,966
You don't believe in rules,
yet you want to control Ned's anger.

391
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,218
Yeah. You've got
to help us, doc.

392
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,304
We've tried nothing,
and we're all out of ideas.

393
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,724
Hmm... There is
an experimental therapy

394
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,685
that might help Ned
contain his anger.

395
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,854
It was known as
the "University of Minnesota

396
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,981
Spankalogical Protocol."

397
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,450
And that's just
about eight months...

398
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,035
Hmm... Now.

399
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,580
Well, Ned,
how do you feel?

400
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,665
I feel...

401
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,916
Fine.

402
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,668
You don't feel...

403
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,669
Angry?

404
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,380
Abso-tively not-arino.

405
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,299
How do you feel about me?

406
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,551
Pretty darn
diddily-doodly...

407
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,345
good.

408
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,889
The only problem
with the treatment

409
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,599
was that it worked too well.

410
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,685
You became unable
to express any anger at all.

411
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,480
From that point on,
any time you felt angry

412
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,065
you could only respond

413
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,484
with a string
of nonsensical jabbering.

414
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,402
Well, I'll be
darn-diddily-arned.

415
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,653
Yeah, that's the stuff.

416
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,697
You suppressed your rage
for so long

417
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:58,077
it finally erupted as
a massive public explosion.

418
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,745
It sure did-diddily-id.

419
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,997
All right, all right,
just watch it there.

420
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,582
I'm here to help,
you know.

421
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,709
Now, I'd like
to try something.

422
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,169
Is there any person

423
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,422
who makes you
particularly angry?

424
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,632
(phone rings)

425
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,758
Yello?

426
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,551
Yes?

427
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,346
Mental hospital?!

428
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,764
I don't know
any Ned Flanders.

429
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,057
The man who lived
next door

430
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,600
until his house
blew down.

431
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,102
Oh, him.

432
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,732
Mr. Simpson?
Dr. Foster.

433
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,983
Please come with me.

434
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,819
You folks are free
to roam the grounds.

435
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,945
Just remember:

436
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,114
One of our patients
is a cannibal.

437
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,740
Try to guess which one.

438
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,867
I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.

439
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,789
MAN: Everyone outside
of this room is against me!

440
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:44,790
I can hear you walking by--

441
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,626
It stinks! It stinks!

442
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,961
It stinks!

443
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,839
Yes, Mr. Sherman,
everything stinks.

444
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,676
We want to teach Ned

445
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,970
to release his anger
in healthy doses.

446
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,472
We need someone
so irritating

447
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:04,476
that Ned simply will not be able
to repress his rage.

448
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,521
Homer,
can you be that annoying?

449
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,898
(grunts)
What?

450
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,150
Get in the booth.

451
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,827
"Ned Flanders,
I mock your value system.

452
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,497
You also appear foolish
in the eyes of others."

453
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,291
(chuckles)
Well, howdy, Homer.

454
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,376
Ooh, thanks
for dropping by.

455
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,295
Mm, he's not
responding.

456
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,547
Proceed to level two
antagonism.

457
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,552
"Past instances in which
I professed to like you

458
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,053
were fraudulent."

459
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,681
Oh, well, I'll just
have to try harder.

460
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,433
(chuckles)
Ooh! Thanks for dropping by.

461
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,476
Ah, he's still repressing.

462
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,187
Maximum hostility factor.

463
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,607
"I engaged in intercourse

464
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,859
with your spouse
or significant other."

465
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,111
Now, that's psychiatry.

466
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,529
Huh? Huh?

467
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,864
(forced laugh)

468
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,158
Very funny, wise guy.

469
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,659
<i>Aw, that's it.</i>

470
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,702
<i>You just can't</i>
<i>insult this guy.</i>

471
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,329
<i>You call him a moron</i>

472
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,455
<i>and he just sits there</i>
<i>grinning moron-ally.</i>

473
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,873
<i>Hi, neighbor.</i>

474
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,499
You know what your problem is,
Flanders?

475
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,210
You're afraid
to be human.

476
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,670
(chuckles) No.
Now, why would I be afraid of that?

477
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,714
Because humans are
obnoxious sometimes.

478
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,299
Humans hate things.

479
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,218
Well, maybe a few
of them do...

480
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,719
Back east.

481
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,679
I can't find what
Homer's saying.

482
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,680
Did you write that?

483
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,724
Um... Did you like it?

484
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,267
Come on, Flanders.

485
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,477
There's got to be
something you hate.

486
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,895
What about mosquito bites?

487
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,648
Mmm-mmm.
Sure are fun to scratch.

488
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,191
Mmm, satisfying.

489
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,735
What about, uh...

490
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,403
fluorescent lights?

491
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,572
Oh, they hum like angels.

492
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,283
You're never lonely if you've
got a fluorescent light.

493
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,285
See?
You like everything.

494
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,204
No, that's not true.

495
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,082
I--I--I... I don't like
the service at the post office.

496
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:54,461
You know, it's all rush, rush,
get you in, get you out.

497
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,088
Then they've got those
machines in the lobby--

498
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,756
They're even faster.
No help there.

499
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,174
You might even say...

500
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,927
I hate the post office.

501
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,971
That and my parents.

502
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,222
Lousy beatniks.

503
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,976
Hey, that felt good.

504
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,978
He just said
he hates his parents.

505
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,688
Do you know
what that means?

506
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,481
Uh, what do you think?

507
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,857
It means he's cured.

508
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,192
That's what I said.

509
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,196
(cheering)

510
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:24,908
Thanks, everyone.

511
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,576
I'm all better now.

512
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,663
No more storing up the anger
till I explode.

513
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,748
If any of you does something
I don't like,

514
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,583
you are going to hear
about it.

515
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,837
(cheering and applauding
and whistling)

516
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,715
Yes, that's
very healthy, Ned.

517
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,425
And if you really tick me off,

518
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,343
I'm going to run you down
with my car.

519
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,971
-Ha!
-Yeah... Um...

520
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,015

521
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,725

522
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,144
Ned, you so crazy.
