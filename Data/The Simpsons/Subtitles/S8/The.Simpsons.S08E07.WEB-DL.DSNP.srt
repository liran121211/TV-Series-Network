(gasps) Uh,
Superintendent Chalmers!

8
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,953
What's wrong?

9
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,997
Nothing.
I just bought myself a car.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,999
Oh. Oh, good.

11
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,876
This will sound crazy

12
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,712
but at first, I thought
I'd enraged you again.

13
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,297
-Skinner!
-What? What?

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,008
Ah, you're getting paranoid.

15
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,968
You know,
I used to think a car

16
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,887
was just a way of getting
from point "A" to point "B"

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,931
and on weekends, point "C,"
but that was the old me.

18
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:02,812
That man died the moment I laid eyes
on the 1979 Honda Accord.

19
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,898
I've always admired car owners,

20
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,816
and I hope to be one myself

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,777
as soon as I finish
paying off Mother.

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,987
She insists I pay
her retroactively

23
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,530
for the food
I ate as a child.

24
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,908
Yeah, yeah.
That's unfortunate.

25
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,660
Well, Seymour,
I make superintendent money

26
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,288
which amply covers
both food and car.

27
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,083
Holy jumping Caesar's catfish!

28
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,709
My "H" has been stolen.

29
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,504
Oh, that's how people
know it's a Honda.

30
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,130
What's the point
of having a Honda

31
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,507
if you can't show it off?

32
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,301
Sir, if you'll just
stop yelling at me

33
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,886
I'm sure I can
find a replacement.

34
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,807
(grunting)
Here we... I'll just...

35
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,850
Hey! Get away from my car!

36
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,060
-Uh-oh. This way.
-Uh-oh.

37
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,482

38
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,903

40
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,282
Eh... morning, Apu.

41
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,826
Good morning.

42
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,869
One doughnut
with sprinkles...

43
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,956
(gasps) Wait a minute,
these are not sprinkles, sir.

44
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,833
-What do you mean?
-You've clearly taken items

45
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,335
from the candy rack and placed them
on top of the doughnut

46
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,170
in an attempt
to pass them off as sprinkles.

47
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,756
Well, it was like that
when I got here.

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,551
-It really was.
-A Mounds bar is not a sprinkle.

49
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,427
A Twizzler is not a sprinkle.

50
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,930
A Jolly Rancher
is not a sprinkle, sir.

51
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,641
Perhaps in Shangri-La 
they are, but not here.

52
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,477
-(moans)
-(bell chimes)

53
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,437
APU:
Thank you. Come again.

54
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,023
(police radio chatter)

55
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,859
Ah, looks like
we put the kibosh

56
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,861
on another two-bit
telephone swindle, boys.

57
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:36,156
Frankly, I would have expected
better from Jimmy the Scumbag.

58
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,282
Meh.

59
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,164
-Hey, what's this thing?
-Huh? Well, that's an auto-dialer.

60
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,041
This bird was using it to
pull a telemarketing scam.

61
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,043
But instead, he's going
to rot in the slammer

62
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,587
for the next 20 years.

63
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,714
Bread and water,
icy showers,

64
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,049
guards whomping
your ass round the clock,

65
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,844
and the only way out
is suicide.

66
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,471
Telemarketing, eh?

67
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,725
(snickering)

68
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,893
Ha-ha!

69
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,896
(boys laughing)

70
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,899
Oh, you think
this stolen "H"

71
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,984
is a laugh riot,
don't you?

72
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,320
Well, I'll tell you
something that's not so funny.

73
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,947
Right now Superintendent
Chalmers is at home

74
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,908
crying like a little girl.

75
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,701
(loud laughter)

76
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:25,121
(chuckling)
I guess it is a little funny.

77
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,540
Nonetheless,
I will find the culprit.

78
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:31,461
We'll start with...
oh, I don't know...

79
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,837
Bart Simpson.

80
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,467
Um, I don't think you want
to look in there, sir.

81
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,762
Balderdash. I'll just
stick my head right in...

82
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,890
half a dozen eggs?

83
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:47,101
Well, that would be
the complete dozen.

84
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,562
All right, rather than tempt
fate, I'll move along now.

85
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,316
And so we reach
the bottom of the barrel,

86
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,359
Nelson Muntz.

87
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,069
(hums fanfare)

88
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,863
The cold, hard process
of elimination places the "H"

89
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,115
squarely in your locker.

90
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,077
(both gasp)

91
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,328
Ha-ha!

92
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,666
Damn! Dang! Darn!

93
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:17,799
(gasping) A principal's ransom
in stolen goods.

94
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,008
Well, sir,

95
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,969
who's ha-ha-ing now, hmm?

96
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,347
I don't know, but he's
got lethal tuna-breath.

97
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,933
ALL: Ooh!

98
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,977
Who does Nelson think
he's impressing anyway

99
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,145
acting so cool
all the time?

100
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,689
Not me.

101
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,983
All right, Mr. Smartenheimer,
that does it.

102
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,111
First, you're going to give back
everything you've stolen.

103
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,946
Then I'm sentencing you
to one week

104
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,991
of the lowest, most degrading
work known to man.

105
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,326
-Janitorial work.
-Ah, gee.

106
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,578
I'm standing right here, sir.

107
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,164
Ah, yes. Uh...

108
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,791
Take a good look
at him, Nelson,

109
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,918
'cause that's where
you're headed.

110
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,170
After you claim
your stolen merchandise,

111
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,549
go directly to Mr. Muntz
for an apology.

112
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,009
Bite me.

113
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,510
Cram it.

114
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,178
You're dead.

115
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,431
Get bent, ma'am.

116
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,308
Why do you have to be such
a pain all the time?

117
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,643
Don't you realize you're
getting a bad reputation?

118
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,187
Don't you realize
your butt sticks out?

119
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,148
It does not.

120
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,816
-Hey!
-Ha-ha!

121
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,322
An automatic dialer?
Is that legal?

122
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,157
I don't want you
getting arrested, Homer.

123
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,366
I won't.

124
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,744
Or swindling our neighbors.

125
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,495
Let me show you
how it works.

126
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,166
This baby has every phone number
in town programmed into it.

127
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:37,211
It automatically calls them
one by one and plays my message.

128
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,338
Listen.

129
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,465
(touch tones beeping)

130
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,674
(telephone ringing)

131
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:42,884
Ahoy-hoy?

132
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,511
HOMER:
<i>Greetings, friend.</i>

133
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,638
<i>Do you wish to look</i>
<i>as happy as me?</i>

134
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,683
<i>Well, you've got the power</i>
<i>inside you right now,</i>

135
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,312
<i>so use it and send one</i>
<i>dollar to Happy Dude,</i>

136
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,522
<i>742 Evergreen Terrace,</i>
<i>Springfield.</i>

137
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,232
<i>Don't delay.</i>

138
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,193
<i>Eternal happiness</i>
<i>is just a dollar away.</i>

139
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,779
Hmm...

140
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,074
one dollar
for eternal happiness.

141
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,700
Mmm...

142
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,243
I'd be happier
with the dollar.

143
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,205
(chuckling) Now we just sit
by the mailbox

144
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,123
and watch
the money roll in.

145
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,209
But you're going to annoy
thousands of people

146
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,586
just to make
a few measly dollars.

147
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,296
It's nothing but panhandling.

148
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,256
Tele-panhandling.

149
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,759
And should there be requests
for an encore,

150
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:28,012
we will reprise
"Pop Goes the Weasel."

151
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,348
Otherwise, we will
file out quietly.

152
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,101
-(sighs)
-(water splashing)

153
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,144
And that's how Willie waters.

154
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,188
Now, you take the hoose.

155
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,523
The moose?

156
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,149
The hoose! The hoose!

157
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,234
Is this right?

158
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,277
Agh, turn off the noozle!

159
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,071
The noodles? What noodles?

160
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,322
The noozle at the end
of the hoose.

161
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,365
(laughing)

162
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,075
Miss Simpson?

163
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,286
Do you find something funny
about the word tromboner?

164
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,082
No, sir. I was laughing
at something outside.

165
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,500
She was looking at Nelson.

166
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,253
ALL:
<i>♪ Lisa likes Nelson ♪</i>

167
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,421
She does not.

168
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,840
<i>♪ Milhouse likes Lisa ♪</i>

169
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,841

173
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,765

Lisa, you've got detention.

175
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,145
(grumbling)

176
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,115
Oh, how does Bart 
do this every week?

177
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,160
Hey, brainiac. Since when
do you get detention?

178
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,538
It's your fault. I accidentally laughed
at your immature prank.

179
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,165
Ha! Yeah.

180
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,750
The best part
was when he got wet.

181
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,419
Hey, you're doing that
the stupid way.

182
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,504
If you use that deal
with the five chalks

183
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,298
you'll get done faster.

184
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,216
Thanks, but I prefer
the honest way.

185
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,135
Whatever.
Smell you later.

186
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,059
Hmm.

187
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,612
Wow, that was
a good idea,

188
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,363
and I can't believe
it came from Nelson.

189
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,367
(thinking) <i>He's not like anybody</i>
<i>I've ever met.</i>

190
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,328
<i>He's like a riddle</i>
<i>wrapped in an enigma</i>

191
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,330
<i>wrapped in a vest.</i>

192
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,790
<i>Sure is ugly, though.</i>

193
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,169
<i>So why can't I stop</i>
<i>staring at him?</i>

194
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,421
<i>Oh, no.</i>

195
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,175
<i>I think I'm getting a crush</i>
<i>on Nelson Muntz.</i>

196
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,093
Hey, Willie!
Catch the football!

197
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,512
All right, I'll--

198
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,264
-(Willie screaming)
-(bees buzzing)

199
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,265
(dreamy sigh)

200
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,650
-(laughing)
-Milhouse, I've never told anyone

201
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,193
this kind of thing before,

202
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,737
but I've never felt
this way before.

203
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,406
-I think I have a crush...
-(gasps)

204
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,367
Uh, oh, really?

205
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,952
On Nelson Muntz.

206
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,787
(gagging)

207
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,914
Way to drink, Poindexter!

208
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,250
(coughing)
You like Nelson?

209
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,168
(coughing)
But he's a creep,

210
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,628
and he chipped
one of my permanent teeth.

211
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,129
But I bet underneath

212
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,507
he's a sweet, sensitive
person... like you.

213
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,510
I guess you could say
I want to bring out

214
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,262
the Milhouse in Nelson.

215
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,931
But I'm all Milhouse!

216
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,725
Plus, my mom says I'm the
handsomest guy in school.

217
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,102
I like you too, Milhouse,

218
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,521
but not in that way.

219
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,440
-You're more like a big sister.
-No, I'm not.

220
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,484
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

221
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,236
Would you do me a favor?

222
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,238
When you get back to class,
just give him this note.

223
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,407
Ohh...

224
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,992
Please?

225
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,744
(thinking) <i>When she sees you'll do</i>
<i>anything she says,</i>

226
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,122
<i>she's bound to respect you.</i>

227
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,166
Sure!
What's a big sister for?

228
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,712
Oh... I shouldn't
have said that.

229
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,135
"Guess who likes you."

230
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,930
(siren wailing)

231
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,437
Milhouse, I'm so sorry.

232
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,980
He can't hear you now.

233
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,982
We had to pack
his ears with gauze.

234
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,487
Nelson. Um...

235
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,823
that note Milhouse gave you,

236
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:16,991
it wasn't from him.

237
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,036
It was from... me.

238
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,747
You? Why would you like me?

239
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,790
No girls like me.

240
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,917
Are you wearing a wire?

241
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,587
I don't know why
I like you, I just do.

242
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,715
So... what do you think?

243
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,509
It's okay... I guess.

244
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,178
Do I have to do anything?

245
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,597
Well, would you like

246
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,349
to come over to my house
after school?

247
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,018
Okay.
But if anybody sees us,

248
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,811
I'm just there
to steal your bike.

249
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,855
(tires screeching)

250
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:51,525
(panting)
Huh? Ooh.

251
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,321
Whoo-hoo!
Two dollars!

252
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,947
It's working!

253
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,866
I don't feel any happier.

254
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,451
How about you?

255
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,079
Mmm, a little.

256
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,080
(wheels squeaking)

257
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,915
Oh, you got to see this.

258
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,000
It's so cute what she does.

259
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,168
Be the baby, kitty.

260
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,420
Go on. Be the baby!

261
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,089
(laughs)
Come on.

262
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,050
-(cat yowling)
-Snowball!

263
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,885
-(cat shrieking)
-You don't understand.

264
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,888
She loves to climb in here.

265
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,099
I believe you!
I don't care!

266
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,559
Hey, Lise, Mom said you had
the toenail clippers, and--

267
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,062
Whoa, Lisa! Look out!
Nelson's in our house!

268
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,523
It's okay.
I invited him over.

269
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:34,151
-Nelson's my new friend.
-Are you nuts?

270
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,319
I'll probably never
say this to you again,

271
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,071
but you can do better.

272
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,864
Please don't ruin
this for me, Bart.

273
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,574
I think he's starting
to like me.

274
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,119
-Milhouse likes you.
-Oh, please!

275
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,787
Milhouse likes Vaseline 
on toast.

276
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,830
Hmm.

277
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,958
(dialing)

278
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,668
(whirring)

279
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,963
Oh, pawns can't move that way,
you stupid arm!

280
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,965
-(phone rings)
-Lab.

281
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,717
HOMER (on recording):
<i>Greetings, friend.</i>

282
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,593
<i>Do you wish to</i>
<i>look as happy as me?</i>

283
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,930
(gasps) Why, it's the
AT-5000 auto-dialer,

284
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,057
my very first patent.

285
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,518
Ah, would you listen
to the gibberish

286
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,561
they've got you saying?

287
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,979
It's sad and alarming.

288
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,981
You were designed
to alert schoolchildren

289
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,191
about snow days and such.

290
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,569
Well, let's get you home
to Frinky.

291
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,947
-Hope your wheels still work.
-(keypad beeping)

292
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,031
(vibrating, whirring)

293
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,620
Oh, no, you don't.

294
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,459
(grunts)

295
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,252
You're the first person
I've had over to the house

296
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,754
since my dad went nuts.

297
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,893
"Nuke the whales"?

298
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,228
You don't really
believe that, do you?

299
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,689
I don't know.
Gotta nuke something.

300
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,025
Touché.

301
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,359
You play the guitar?

302
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,653
Oh, yeah.
I'm a superstar.

303
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,031
Would you play a song for me?

304
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,867
Oh. Okay.

305
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,329
(strings tuning)

306
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,418
<i>♪ Joy to the world ♪</i>

307
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,837

313
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,770
I wish I could laugh

314
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,105
at the idea of a teacher
being decapitated.

315
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,273
I know.

316
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,691
(chuckles)
It's funny, huh?

317
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,819
Hardly.

318
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,404
Listen, I'm getting
pretty tired.

319
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,532
I'm going to go
to sleep for a while.

320
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,116
Smell you later.

321
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,203
-How am I supposed to get home?
-I don't know.

322
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,497
You should have thought of that
before you came over. Heh.

323
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,959
I feel so stupid, Mom.

324
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,669
Nelson's not right
for me at all,

325
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,462
and I don't think
he ever will be.

326
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,298
Well, most women will tell
you that you're a fool

327
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,842
to think you can change a man,

328
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,845
but those women are quitters.

329
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,347
-What?
-When I first met your father,

330
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,225
he was loud, crude,
and piggish,

331
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:15,187
but I worked hard on him,
and now he's a whole new person.

332
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:19,650
-Mom?
-He's a whole new person, Lisa.

333
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,235
Oh, I know.

334
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,862
Mmm.

335
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,655
I wonder if I could
change Nelson.

336
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,908
Very sharp.

337
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,536
Oh, but I feel
like such a tool.

338
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,162
I know it's a change,

339
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,998
but it highlights your sweet
and sensitive side.

340
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,666
Aw, crap.

341
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,544
LISA:
Isn't it nice up here?

342
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,296
What are you thinking,
Nelson?

343
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,256
What am I thinking about what?

344
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,216
-About anything.
-Nothing.

345
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,468
Mm... what do you feel?

346
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,178
What's inside you right now?

347
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,348
Guts and black stuff...

348
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,933
and about 50 Slim Jims.

349
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,811
Come on, Nelson,
you must think and feel things.

350
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,521
I mean, look where we are...

351
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,232
a rolling, green hillside,
the stars coming out

352
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,276
like God is lighting
a million tiny candles.

353
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,904
The moon looking down
on us as if to say...

354
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,324
<i>(gasps)</i>
<i>My first kiss.</i>

355
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,200
<i>I always wondered</i>
<i>what it would be like.</i>

356
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,369
<i>This ought to shut her up.</i>

357
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,497
<i>Hey... this isn't so bad.</i>

358
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,719
That was pretty fine.

359
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,804
See? You do have
a tender side.

360
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,223
You just needed someone
to bring it out.

361
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,352
Yeah. That was
pretty rockin'.

362
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,443
Oh, man!
You kissed a girl!

363
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,112
That is so gay!

364
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:51,367
Listen, you thugs!
Stop making fun of him or you'll be sorry.

365
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,327
ALL: Whoa!

366
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,162
You'll be so sorry
when you realize

367
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,247
how you've hurt the feelings
of a sweet young man.

368
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,999
(groaning)

369
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,461
He's not like you anymore.
He's changed.

370
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,254
And he doesn't want
to hang around

371
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,340
with a bunch of crumb-bums.

372
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,758
Crumb-bums?

373
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,969
Nobody calls me a crumb-bum.

374
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,680
Hey, back off, James.

375
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,391
I'll handle this, Lisa.
You go have a fig bar.

376
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,399
Hey, thanks for
embarrassing me, dingus.

377
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,484
You asked for it, man.

378
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,777
You're broadcasting
geek rays

379
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,320
over the entire valley.

380
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,031
'Fraid not.
I'm still wicked bad.

381
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,200
Oh, yeah?
Then prove it, ass butt.

382
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,827
Come raid Skinner's
house with us.

383
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,829
We found a bunch
of rancid coleslaw

384
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,956
in the Dumpster
behind Krusty Burger.

385
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,126
Yeah, and we're going
to go heave it at his house.

386
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,544
Cool!

387
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,087
I'd love to get even
with Skinner.

388
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,714
Uh...

389
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,299
Uh, but I better not.

390
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,261
(clucking)
Chicken!

391
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,595
-Lame-o!
-Girl lover!

392
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,181
-Fancy pants!
-Charlatan!

393
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,685
You got rid of them,
and you did it like a gentleman

394
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,645
without any violence.

395
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,938
Yeah.

396
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,690
I know you don't
like that stuff.

397
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,693
(touch tones beeping)

398
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,740
(phone ringing)

399
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,074
NED:
Howdily-diddely.

400
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,367
HOMER:
<i>Greetings, friends.</i>

401
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,994
<i>Do you wish to look as--</i>

402
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,164
Oh, it was that
darn recording again.

403
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,999
Of course it was.

404
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,753
It's been calling all night.
Just unplug the phone.

405
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,921
-(phone ringing)
-Howdily...

406
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,757
<i>-Greetings, friends.</i>
-Dang!

407
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,925
I told you to unplug the phone.

408
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,594
-But it could be my mother.
-(ringing)

409
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,803
-Howdy--
<i>-Greetings, friends.</i>

410
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,388
-Shoot!
-That is it, Ned.

411
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,015
If you don't unplug
that phone right now,

412
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,725
you're sleeping on the lawn.

413
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,977
Will you two shut up?

414
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,604
People are trying to sleep!

415
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,485
(loud thumping)

416
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,071
Great Barrier Reef!
We're under attack!

417
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,781
Eat slaw, Skinner!

418
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,616
We're slawing him
up good!

419
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,743
Nelson doesn't know
what he's missing.

420
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,788
Why is he wasting his time
with that Simpson chick?

421
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,999
'Cause your mom had
a three-month waiting list.

422
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,126
-All right!
-I knew you'd be back.

423
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,669
Hey, what'd you say
about my mom?

424
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,837
(all talking at once)

425
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,464
I missed you guys.

426
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,591
Let's never fight again.

427
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,645
Who's out there? Give me your names
so I can tell the police.

428
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,022
AGNES: Seymour,
what's going on?

429
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,023
What's that odor?

430
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,775
Go back to bed, Mother.

431
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,111
I've got it under control.
Listen, you crumb-bums.

432
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:36,031
If you think I'm impressed,
I am not. (stammers)

433
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,118
Oh, brandishing your buttocks
is only getting me angrier.

434
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,869
AGNES: I want to see
what's going on!

435
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,247
No, Mother,
don't look out the window!

436
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,125
-(Mother screaming)
-(sighs)

437
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,378
-(siren wailing)
-Cops! Everybody split up.

438
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,348
-(thuds)
-Lisa, the cops are chasing me.

439
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,766
I need a place to hide.

440
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,018
Lisa's window is the next one.

441
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,812
(phone ringing)

442
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,230
-NED: Howdly-doo...
<i>-Greetings, friends.</i>

443
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,815
MAUDE: Ned, did you plug
that phone back in?

444
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,775
Shut up!

445
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,028
And I wasn't
even there, honest.

446
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,864
Skinner's just out to get me.

447
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,866
-That's so unfair.
-(siren approaching)

448
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,033
Uh-oh.

449
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,743
Meet me at the back door.

450
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,253
Aha! I had a feeling
we'd find you here.

451
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,673
-Chief, no!
-What'd you do that for?

452
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,593
Well, that thing's been
driving the whole town nuts.

453
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,262
Got me out of the bath
seven times. Seven!

454
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,931
Hey, who shot the auto-dialer?

455
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,266
Marge's auto-dialer.

456
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,767
See you in court, Simpson.

457
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,895
Oh, and, uh, bring
that evidence with you.

458
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,981
Otherwise, I got no case
and you'll go scot-free, you know.

459
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,066
Uh, Chief, what about
those coleslaw punks?

460
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,862
Well, I can't be everywhere
at once, Lou, now can I?

461
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,739
You know, in most cities,
the chief of police

462
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,741
doesn't even go out
on calls like these.

463
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,076
-Yeah, yeah. We know, Chief.
-We appreciate it.

464
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,828
-Count our blessings every day.
-We're very appreciative.

465
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,207
I think they're giving up.

466
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,711
Thanks for helping me out.
You're a stand-up babe.

467
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,379
Hey, check it out.

468
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,882
Skinner's mopping the goo
off his house.

469
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:20,302
Wait till he finds
what I left in his birdbath.

470
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,887
SKINNER: No!

471
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,893
I thought you weren't there.

472
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:28,936
Huh?

473
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,105
Oh, yeah.
Uh... I guess I was.

474
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,024
-You lied to me.
-Nuh-uh.

475
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,943
There. You did it again.

476
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,570
All right, all right, I lied.
I'm sorry. Let's kiss.

477
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,073
No! You don't understand,
Nelson.

478
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,700
A kiss doesn't mean anything
if it's dishonest.

479
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:47,079
Um... there's
a niceness to it.

480
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,957
I was foolish to think
I'd actually changed you.

481
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,750
Maybe I was
seeing things in you

482
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,669
that weren't really there.

483
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,003
Definitely.

484
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,964
Then why did you want
to be with me?

485
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,217
Mmm-mm, maybe 'cause you
were the first person

486
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,886
that ever thought there
was a nice guy inside me.

487
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,766
Hmm. Well, guess you really
blew that one, huh?

488
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,559
Well, I guess this is it.

489
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,270
You mean, like, good-bye?

490
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,606
Let's just call it
"smell you later."

491
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,453
(sniffing)

492
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,708
Hi, Lisa.

493
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,251
Could I talk to you,

494
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,586
or would that just make
Nelson whale on me again?

495
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,798
Don't worry. Nelson and I don't
like each other anymore.

496
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,550
(gasps)
Really?

497
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,303
You got anybody in mind
for your next crush?

498
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:48,390
Well, I'm really not
thinking about that now.

499
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,476
I suppose it could be
almost anybody.

500
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,020
