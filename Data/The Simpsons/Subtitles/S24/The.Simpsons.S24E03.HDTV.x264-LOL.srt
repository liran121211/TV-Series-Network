1
00:00:01,926 --> 00:00:03,597
Oh, man, not another election.

2
00:00:03,697 --> 00:00:05,432
Why do we have
to choose our leaders?

3
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:07,400
Isn't that what we have
the Supreme Court for?

4
00:00:09,336 --> 00:00:11,304
If you're gonna vote,

5
00:00:11,338 --> 00:00:12,972
we'll need
some photo I.D.

6
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:14,507
But I lived here all my life.

7
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:16,810
Stopping all Americans
from voting is

8
00:00:16,844 --> 00:00:18,912
for the protection
of all Americans.

9
00:00:18,946 --> 00:00:22,215
But I'm a 40-year-old white guy
who didn't go to college

10
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:24,951
and gets all his news from
monitors at gas stations.

11
00:00:24,985 --> 00:00:26,853
In you go.

12
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:29,973
Barack Obama?

13
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:31,241
I don't know.

14
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:33,576
I already got one wife
telling me to eat healthy.

15
00:00:33,611 --> 00:00:35,078
Plus he promised me
death panels,

16
00:00:35,112 --> 00:00:36,412
and Grandpa's still alive.

17
00:00:36,447 --> 00:00:37,914
Mitt Romney?

18
00:00:37,948 --> 00:00:40,150
I hear he wears
magic underpants.

19
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:42,886
I expect the leader of the
free world to go commando.

20
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,288
Plus his horse totally choked
at the Olympics.

21
00:00:45,322 --> 00:00:48,391
On the other hand,
he <i>did</i> invent Obamacare.

22
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:52,089
Thank you for voting
for Mitt Romney.

23
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:54,697
You may now see
his tax returns.

24
00:00:54,731 --> 00:00:58,350
Wow. Medical deduction
for personality implant?

25
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,369
He's got six wives
all named Ann.

26
00:01:00,403 --> 00:01:03,088
The government paid <i>him</i> taxes
for five years!

27
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:04,657
I've got to tell the press!

28
00:01:06,326 --> 00:01:10,429
You are now being outsourced.

29
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:13,182
Oh, I hate being sucked
into tubes!

30
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:18,587
Well, at least I got
a steady job.

31
00:01:18,622 --> 00:01:19,822
D'oh!

32
00:01:19,856 --> 00:01:20,823
<i>Oh!</i>

33
00:01:27,197 --> 00:01:30,232
Hummingbirds, hum and get it!

34
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,864
Homie, the faucet is dripping.

35
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,533
I'll get right on it.

36
00:01:50,203 --> 00:01:52,705
Homer, when are you going
to fix this faucet?

37
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:54,306
I'm on it!

38
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,677
Are you going
to fix the faucet or not?

39
00:01:58,712 --> 00:02:02,748
For the third time
this year, yes!

40
00:02:02,782 --> 00:02:03,766
Hmpf!

I'll get to it..."

44
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:37,333
When we first got married,

45
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:39,535
he'd only take six
months to do things.

46
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:42,821
Mom, how come you didn't do
my homework last night?

47
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:49,278
Oh, no!

48
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:52,815
Lisa's face, it's the same!

49
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:54,316
Everyone, relax.

50
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:57,252
I think I've got an emergency
sinkhole kit in here somewhere.

51
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:00,873
Ooh!

52
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:04,142
(air his

53
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,145
Oh, man, I got to climb stairs?
Forget it.

54
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:09,415
No one stays in the sinkhole!

55
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:11,917
Lousy surface dwellers.

56
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:17,489
So, what seems
to be the problem?

57
00:03:17,524 --> 00:03:20,292
Springfielders are getting
that sinking feeling...

58
00:03:21,711 --> 00:03:24,880
...as the dangerous sinkhole
continues to expand.

59
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,516
While this sinkhole is larger
than the Sarlacc pit

60
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,618
which swallowed Boba Fett,

61
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:31,920
it is smaller than the Geonosis
battlerena

62
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:34,656
where Jango Fett was beheaded
by Mace Windu.

63
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:37,192
Weren't those two places
about the same size?

64
00:03:37,227 --> 00:03:39,511
I didn't know
this was an ambush!

65
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:42,147
Eh, you know, in this town,
you learn to adjust to things:

66
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:45,467
runaway monorails,
NASCAR star Jeff Gordon.

67
00:03:45,502 --> 00:03:46,468
Hey, Moe.

68
00:03:46,503 --> 00:03:49,088
Hey.
Bet we never see him again.

69
00:03:49,122 --> 00:03:51,457
I'm gonna call
it a day, Moe.

70
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:56,395
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

71
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:58,130
That plank's
only for coming in!

72
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:01,834
Try to land on
the other traitors.

73
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:06,121
People of Springfield,
please be cool like Lou.

74
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:07,322
Yo.

75
00:04:07,357 --> 00:04:09,725
We will eliminate one eyesore
with another

76
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,529
by bulldozing our tire fire
right into the sinkhole.

77
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:16,832
But my car's down there!

78
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:20,436
For the first time,

79
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,771
my administration has solved
a problem.

80
00:04:22,806 --> 00:04:26,341
The hole has been filled by the
stuff!

81
00:04:35,552 --> 00:04:37,202
So, just when
my dad finishes

82
00:04:37,237 --> 00:04:40,038
his online degree
in Sinkhole Engineering,

83
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:41,573
they go and fill it in!

84
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:42,674
Are the credits
transferable?

85
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:44,910
No.
That guy has  a bone to pick

86
00:04:44,944 --> 00:04:46,095
with the Board
of Regents.

87
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:48,046
Hey, Lisa's not
getting on the bus.

88
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:51,133
Where's she going?

89
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,368
I don't know.
Dork farm? Who cares?

90
00:04:53,403 --> 00:04:56,338
She never doesn't do
what she's supposed to!

91
00:04:56,372 --> 00:04:57,523
This is major!

92
00:04:57,557 --> 00:05:00,058
Fine.
We'll follow her.

93
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:05,614
Well, if they're not taking
the bus, neither am I.

94
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:09,618
I'm going to a accident!

95
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:13,155
Lisa's taking a cab?

96
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:14,723
I'm worried.

97
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:16,742
Does she even know
how much to tip?

98
00:05:19,963 --> 00:05:21,330
What's it say?

99
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:25,033
"The five boxing wizards
jump quickly." Whoa.

100
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:29,054
My sister's finally become...
mildly interesting.

101
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:31,940
Sounds like a case
for the "Detecti-pals."

102
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:33,208
Taxi!

103
00:05:34,494 --> 00:05:37,079
Ah, they never stop
for blue-heads.

104
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:39,248
Hello, ma'am.

105
00:05:39,282 --> 00:05:41,800
Are you and your husband here
to look for a new car?

106
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:43,735
No, I'm here
to buy one myself.

107
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,571
Uh-huh.

108
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:49,441
Well, I think the Tissan
Sensibla is the car for you.

109
00:05:49,476 --> 00:05:50,809
It's got all
the features

110
00:05:50,844 --> 00:05:52,094
that a modern
woman wants,

111
00:05:52,128 --> 00:05:54,913
including all manner
of makeup mirrors.

112
00:05:57,317 --> 00:05:59,284
This car looks
a little small.

113
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,385
Is the engine powerful?

114
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,288
Wow, somebody
knows her cars.

115
00:06:03,323 --> 00:06:08,093
This baby comes with
an RX-12 2-cylinder.

116
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,829
Well, that's odd, because
the consumer Web site says

117
00:06:10,864 --> 00:06:12,598
the RX-12 2-cylinder has

118
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:14,967
a dealer's invoice
of $14,700.

119
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:17,035
You know what I'm gonna do?

120
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,570
I'm gonna talk
to my manager.

121
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:20,806
This says you <i>are</i> the manager.

122
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,742
Those Web sites are taking food
out of my children's mouths.

123
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:26,445
It says on your Facebook page
you have no kids.

124
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,813
I have two Yorkies,

125
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:30,516
and I'll be talking
about you to them tonight!

126
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:33,669
I got to hand it
to you, Marge.

127
00:06:33,703 --> 00:06:36,288
You got the exact amount
of car for our family.

128
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:39,741
Room for two adults, three kids
and zero grandpas.

129
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:41,026
Mm-hmm.

130
00:06:41,044 --> 00:06:43,545
Uh-oh!
Do you hear that rattle?

131
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,963
I don't hear anything.

132
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:45,948
Me, neither.

133
00:06:45,982 --> 00:06:48,199
And what's that smell?

134
00:06:48,218 --> 00:06:50,335
I think it's "new car smell."

135
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,503
Well, I don't like it.

136
00:07:03,816 --> 00:07:06,351
I still smell it!

137
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:10,923
Darn car won't start.

138
00:07:10,957 --> 00:07:14,693
Let Automobile Von Bismarck
give it a try.

139
00:07:16,162 --> 00:07:17,329
Well...

140
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:19,398
Hmm. Well, it wouldn't
start for me.

141
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:21,400
I think this car's a lemon!

142
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,771
Worst car ever!
I can't believe it!

143
00:07:25,805 --> 00:07:28,006
Hmm...

144
00:07:29,108 --> 00:07:31,043
<i>The wipers wipe backwards,</i>

145
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:33,111
and the defroster lines on

146
00:07:33,146 --> 00:07:34,780
the back window
are too close together!

147
00:07:34,814 --> 00:07:36,615
Excuse me!

148
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,919
Sir, the car is fine.

149
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:42,721
Can I be straight with you?
Mm-hmm.

150
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:44,990
As a mechanic,
I'm not totally qualified

151
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:46,825
to judge mental health...

152
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:49,695
So, you're not
totally unqualified.

153
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:51,893
I think the problem
is in your wife's head.

154
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:52,464
Mm-hmm.

155
00:07:52,465 --> 00:07:55,500
There's a psychological reason
why she hates this car.

156
00:07:55,535 --> 00:07:57,703
Oh, a reason?
What could it be?

157
00:07:57,737 --> 00:08:00,839
I'm sorry, but there's
no diagnostic computer

158
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:02,574
for the female mind.

159
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:06,211
Wow, an auto mechanic
who tells the truth.

160
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:08,146
Mmm!

161
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:10,899
If you want me to examine
your wife overnight,

162
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:12,401
I can arrange a loaner.

163
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:14,136
She's an '83 Yugo.

164
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,705
I don't do laundry
or kiss boo-boos!

165
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:19,374
Uh, no, thanks.

166
00:08:20,393 --> 00:08:21,593
Marge.
Mm-hmm?

167
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,461
Do you think maybe
there's another reason

168
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:24,830
you don't like this car?

169
00:08:24,864 --> 00:08:26,598
Um, a...

170
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:28,266
"feelings" reason?

171
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:29,968
What are you talking about?

172
00:08:30,003 --> 00:08:33,372
Well, maybe you and the car
got off on the wrong foot.

173
00:08:33,406 --> 00:08:35,507
When do you think
things first went wrong?

174
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,576
All right!
I remember we all got in.

175
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,746
And by the way, that backseat
is pretty tight for the kids.

176
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,483

saying no more babies.

178

No, no, Marge.

179
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,792
I want you to explore
your <i>feelings.</i>

180
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:57,562
Homer, the reason
I hate this car is...

181
00:08:57,597 --> 00:08:59,665
I think I want another baby.

182
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:01,867
An "on purpose" baby?!

183
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:03,669

184
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:09,107

190

214
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,365

216

220
00:10:49,764 --> 00:10:51,365

And if you have any ideas,
I'm really running out.

222

224
00:10:57,288 --> 00:10:58,939

and a lady doesn't tell.

226
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:01,708

on the chalkboard?

227
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:03,076

Gentleman doesn't ask,

Martin Luther King Day.

230
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:09,633
My husband and
I have been...

231
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:12,386

232
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,754

233
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:16,523
a towel rack will not
support your weight.

234
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:18,158
But we aren't making a baby.

235
00:11:18,193 --> 00:11:20,594

to make sure Homer has...

236
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:24,031

stuntmen in his cannon.

237

355
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,818
Well, maybe we should
check into a motel.

356
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,759
Ooh, Homie,
you've lost weight.

357
00:16:24,793 --> 00:16:25,793
What's that, baby?

358
00:16:25,827 --> 00:16:26,978
Wha...?

359
00:16:27,012 --> 00:16:28,996
I'll take it
from here, wingman.

360
00:16:33,986 --> 00:16:39,223
Oh, it sure was nice to have
a day together as a couple.

361
00:16:39,257 --> 00:16:42,126
Yeah, no kids to ruin it.

362
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,995
I thought the whole
point of this trip

363
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:45,496
was to have another baby.

364
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,332
Marge, I was just
being a good husband

365
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:50,234
by pretending to agree with you

366
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:52,770
while secretly
undermining your agenda.

367
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,172
So, you don't want another baby?

368
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:56,941
How long have you felt this way?

369
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,876
Uh, well, looking back,

370
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,179
I guess it started
sometime before Bart was born.

371
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,404
Room for one, please.

372
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:24,750
Honey, I'm sorry.

373
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:26,602
It's just that we have
a hard enough time

374
00:17:26,636 --> 00:17:28,086
handling three kids.

375
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:30,472
Emotionally,
financially, the boy...

376
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:32,141
I just didn't know
how to tell you.

377
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:34,894
Just yell across the house
like you do everything else.

378
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,862
Okay, good, we're talking.

379
00:17:36,897 --> 00:17:38,197
We're not talking!

380
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:39,448
Your phone just dialed me.

381
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:41,367
You were pocket-dialed!

382
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:42,935
Hey, the pocket wants
what it wants.

383
00:17:42,953 --> 00:17:43,953
Oh...

384
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:49,258
They just leave the maple
syrup on the table, huh?

385
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:50,259
How about that?

386
00:17:50,293 --> 00:17:52,361
That's trust, huh?
Shush!

387
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:55,030
Now, kids, help
your brother Xander.

388
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:57,766
<i>There he is.</i>

389
00:17:57,801 --> 00:18:01,136
<i>The fat, pathetic slob</i>
<i>I'd be with four kids.</i>

390
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,057
Where's Daddy?

391
00:18:05,091 --> 00:18:06,358
Where'd Daddy go?

392
00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:07,593
Here he is!

393
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:10,496
<i>Oh, right.</i>

394
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,464
<i>That dad was there all along.</i>

395
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:14,800
<i>Whew! That was so sweet.</i>

396
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:17,803
<i>Maybe there's no such thing</i>
<i>as too many kids.</i>

397
00:18:17,837 --> 00:18:19,305
<i>I know what Homer's thinking.</i>

398
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:22,508
<i>He's thinking that he</i>
<i>really wants a baby now.</i>

399
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:25,210
<i>So this should be</i>
<i>the time, ironically,</i>

400
00:18:25,245 --> 00:18:28,080
<i>that I'll change my mind</i>
<i>and not want one.</i>

401
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:30,416
<i>Well, no way!</i>
<i>I want one more than ever!</i>

402
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,820
Uh-oh. I...

403
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:37,656
I don't think I rewound the
video the last time I was here.

404
00:18:37,691 --> 00:18:40,059
Um, I'd like
to get back a donation

405
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:43,862
made 15 years ago
by a Simpson, Homer.

406
00:18:43,897 --> 00:18:46,899
Or it may be under
the name Thad Supersperm.

407
00:18:48,468 --> 00:18:49,652
Homer...

408
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:50,953
Homer, this is the point

409
00:18:50,987 --> 00:18:53,188
where I really have to
know what you want.

410
00:18:53,223 --> 00:18:55,057
I'll tell you
what I want, Marge.

411
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:56,809
I want to make another Simpson.

412
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:58,577
The table with four legs

413
00:18:58,611 --> 00:19:00,763
is sturdier than
the table with three.

414
00:19:00,797 --> 00:19:04,349
Cubes are made of cheese,
but pyramids are schemes.

415
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:06,051
And anything that's half you

416
00:19:06,086 --> 00:19:09,054
is guaranteed 50% perfect.

417
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:10,589
Oh...

418
00:19:10,623 --> 00:19:13,225
Nice speech,
but the last of your sample

419
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:15,194
was just selected
by another couple.

420
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:16,795
Are you sure there isn't more?

421
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,896
I mean, there's always

422
00:19:17,931 --> 00:19:19,365
a little ketchup
left in the bottle.

423
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:20,899
I'm afraid not.

424
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:22,801
But the couple is waiting
in the room there.

425
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:25,704
Maybe you can talk them
into something else.

426
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:29,274
Aah!
Oh!

427
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:31,443
I'd like to buy back my sample.

428
00:19:31,478 --> 00:19:33,145
Are you saying...

429
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,080
our sample came from you?

430
00:19:35,115 --> 00:19:36,548
Here, it's yours.
We don't need it.

431
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,267
Well, I expected
a little argument.

432
00:19:38,301 --> 00:19:40,269
No, no, no, look in the mirror--
that's your argument.

433
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,687
Geez.

434
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:44,056
I mean, I'm no Luis Guzman,
but I'm all right.

435
00:19:49,162 --> 00:19:50,429
Homer?

436
00:19:50,463 --> 00:19:52,798
How many samples did you sell?

437
00:19:52,832 --> 00:19:54,133
Uh...

438
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:56,068
remember that Corvette I had?

439
00:19:56,102 --> 00:19:58,504
I thought they only paid
$50 a trip.

440
00:19:58,538 --> 00:19:59,705
Exactly.

441
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:00,906
Well, we're all set.

442
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,609
Let's make a
Thad Supersperm Jr.

443
00:20:03,643 --> 00:20:05,878
With a name like that,
he could be president.

444
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:07,613
Homie, maybe we should wait.

445
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:08,814
Wha...?

446
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:11,350
Maybe there's enough Homer
in the world for now.

447
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:12,618
Oh.

448
00:20:12,652 --> 00:20:14,586
But I was really
looking forward to...

449
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:18,407
Oh... oh, boy. Uh...

450
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:19,908
You're right, Marge.

451
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:23,378
I don't want to bring more kids
into a world full of my kids.

452
00:20:23,413 --> 00:20:24,746
Yah!

453
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,985
Two adults, please.

454
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:32,437
Enjoy the film, you two.

455
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:40,378
Another thing that would
be harder with four kids.

456
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:42,614
You know, I always send
the theater manager

457
00:20:42,648 --> 00:20:44,082
a check the next day.

458
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,851
D'oh!
