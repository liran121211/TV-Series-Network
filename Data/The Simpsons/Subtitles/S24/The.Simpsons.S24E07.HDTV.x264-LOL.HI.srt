00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:10,477
(children groaning)

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,212
Bart, stop it!

6
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:13,880
You might fall.

7
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:17,117
Oh, he's such
a cute little rascal.

8
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:20,153
(thinking) <i>Oh, my God, is</i>
<i>she flirting with me?</i>

9
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:22,639
I can see where
he gets his good looks.

10
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:24,374
<i>She</i> is <i>flirting</i>
<i>with me!</i>

11
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:26,226
<i>Okay, Homer, let</i>
<i>her down easy.</i>

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,911
<i>Don't go breaking</i>
<i>any hearts.</i>

13
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,147
What a lucky little boy
to get a trip

14
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:31,798
to the park
with his grandpa.

15
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,316
<i>Grandpa?!</i>

16
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:35,018
Grandpa?!

17
00:00:35,052 --> 00:00:36,653
(panting loudly)
Oh, my God!

18
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:38,021
Should I call
an ambulance?

19
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:40,440
Help! An old man is dying!

20
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,492
Oh! This boy's grandfather

21
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:45,545
is a shriveled-up corncob
begging for death!

22
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,314
I am his <i>father!</i>

23
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:51,535
I can't believe I allowed
you to hit on me!

24
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:53,320
(quacking)

25
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:54,821
Beat it, ducks!

26
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:56,473
I'm not old enough
to have food for you!

27
00:00:56,507 --> 00:00:58,491
I'm sexy! Young and sexy!

28
00:00:58,526 --> 00:00:59,743
(ducks quacking)

29
00:00:59,777 --> 00:01:01,060
(bird caws)

30
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:03,196
Old man.
I'm not an old man.

31
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:05,265
This drawing
doesn't think I'm old.

32
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,933
Don't you, drawing?

33
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,503
(gasps) Those aren't
our regular donuts.

34
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:12,923
They're huge!
With crazy toppings!

35
00:01:12,957 --> 00:01:14,191
HOMER:
Gummy worms!

36
00:01:14,225 --> 00:01:15,525
Churro chunks!

37
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,844
Russian nesting
donut!

38
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:22,432
I got to eat the rest!

39
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:23,667
(yelps)
They're gone!

40
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:26,336
Where did these
Devil Donuts come from?

41
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,921
I don't know.
The guy who gives

42
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:29,839
the sexual harassment
seminars brought them in.

43
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:32,776
Actually, Carl, there's <i>no</i>
workplace-appropriate use

44
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,711
for the word "bazooms."

45
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:36,279
What about
"thunderbags"?

46
00:01:36,314 --> 00:01:38,765
Get lost, pervs!

47
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,235
Okay, where did you
get these donuts?!

48
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,771
From a guy with a cart.
It could be anywhere!

49
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,458
CHIEF WIGGUM:
911. What is your emergency?

50
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:52,112
I'm calling to report
a missing donut cart.

51
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:54,113
(siren wailing)

52
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:56,216
I'm not seeing anything.
Can you get any lower?

53
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,951
But, Chief,
the power lines!

54
00:01:57,969 --> 00:01:59,586
(whiny): "But, Chief,
the power lines."

55
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,488
Go lower!

56
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,740
HOMER:
Nope. Nope. Nothing.

57
00:02:03,774 --> 00:02:04,925
Nope.

58
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,476
I see...

59
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,627
devil horns...

60
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:09,562
pitchfork... pointed tail,

61
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,464
hooves are... cloven!

62
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:12,966
We have logo, people!

63
00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:14,017
We have logo!

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,104
Sorry, gents,
we're fresh out.

65
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,607
I only make one batch a day.
When they're gone, I'm done.

66
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,409
Oh, no more donuts?!

67
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:24,010
Make more
or I shoot!

68
00:02:24,045 --> 00:02:26,513
(panting):
I'm not bluffing. Come on.

69
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:27,681
Hmm.

70
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:29,649
What have I become?

71
00:02:29,684 --> 00:02:31,117
It's not a good feeling

72
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:33,019
when you're saying,
"what have I become?"

73
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:34,955
more than once a day.

74
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,222
Mm. Mm-hmm.

75
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,926
Tell you what,
I could give you

76
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:41,795
a sneak preview
of a new donut

77
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,980
that's still
in the R&D phase.

78
00:02:44,015 --> 00:02:47,150
Oh. Beer keg donut?!

79
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:48,385
(slurps)

80
00:02:49,687 --> 00:02:51,087
I would be honored

81
00:02:51,122 --> 00:02:53,256
to shake the hand
that glazed this.

82
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,658
I'm Terence.

83
00:02:54,692 --> 00:02:56,826
(softly):
Tell me everything about you.

84
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:58,361
You're from
Portland?

85
00:02:58,396 --> 00:03:00,363
I've heard of people
being from there.

86
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:01,781
<i>No, I haven't.</i>

87
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:03,683
Yeah, but Portland
just got too played out.

88
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:05,118
The city used
to be <i>real.</i>

89
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,053
Do you know there are
now restaurants there

90
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:09,189
with <i>two</i> locations?
(chuckles)

91
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:10,974
Not near <i>my</i> kids.

92
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:12,709
Wait a minute.
You have <i>kids?</i>

93
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:15,395
You can't have kids.
<i>Look</i> at you.

94
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,364
You have a fun job,
a skull ring--

95
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:19,032
and it's not
Halloween--

96
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,067
<i>and</i> your belt
is a seat belt!

97
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:23,653
No one would ever think
<i>you're</i> a lame old man.

98
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:26,272
Ah, you can't let being
a dad slow you down.

99
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:28,992
Me and the fam are doing
the whole "urban nomad" thing.

100
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,061
You know, just looking
for an undiscovered city

101
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:32,579
with affordable houses.

102
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,230
(gasps) Our houses are
the cheapest!

103
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:36,616
The one next to me's
been on sale forever!

104
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,085
I see them lowering
the price every morning

105
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,454
when I go out to pee.

106
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:43,757
Please. Please rush into this.

107
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,191
Please rush into this.

108
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,593
What a find!

109
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,428
Underneath all
the ugly renovations

110
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,430
this house has
Neutra bones.

111
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,465
In my house,
we found human bones.

112
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,067
Emily and I have
always dreamed

113
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,702
of restoring
an architectural masterpiece.

114
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,472
I have a graduate degree
in Mid-Century Kitsch.

115
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,241
Thanks for turning us on
to this place, Homer.

116
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:02,542
You're a pretty cool guy.

117
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,545
Really? I'm... (gasps) cool?!

118
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,481
Oh, can I man-hug you?

119
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:09,983
Sure.

120
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,619
(grunts)
I don't know how!

121
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,773
Okay, our
first hangout

122
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:18,324
with the cool
new neighbors.

123
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,126
I've already blown
them away--

124
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:21,828
their words,
I assume--

125
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,613
so don't
screw it up!

126
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:26,466
Oh, relax, kids.
Just be yourselves.

127
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,003
Oh, great, Marge,
now that's in their heads!

128
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:33,006
Hey, this is my
armadillo, Chewy.

129
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,809
Uh, Mexico Chewy,
not <i>Star Wars</i> Chewie.

130
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,611
<i>Star Wars</i> Chewie is
just a man in a costume,

131
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:41,581
so he's not scary.

132
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,684
And this is our baby, Corduroy,
(squeals)

133
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,519
and our son, T-Rex.

134
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:48,822
Yeah, neighbors.
Heh, I get it.

135
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:51,124
T-Rex?
Even their names are cool.

136
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,692
Uh, this is,
um...

137
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:57,163
Ice Cream, Bungee Jump,
and... Viral Video.

138
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:58,098
(growls)

139
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:01,084
Wow!
Whoa!

140
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:02,669
BART:
Cool.

141
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,804
Look at these
obscure card games!

142
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,107
Hey, do you have Uno?

143
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,426
I <i>did,</i> when I was <i>uno.</i>

144
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,478
Check out all these
Sergeant Activity dolls!

145
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:13,646
No, that's
Combat Jack,

146
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,715
the original
British doll

147
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,318
that Sergeant
Activity ripped off.

148
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,887
Fine. You have a weird
old version of something.

149
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,338
Let's just watch TV.

150
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:26,443
Uh, TV?
We don't own a TV.

151
00:05:26,477 --> 00:05:28,645
I didn't know
that was an option.

152
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:30,113
I think
I'm done here.

153
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:31,948
Lisa, go nuts.

154
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:35,652
My dad only lets me watch
what's on his queue.

155
00:05:35,686 --> 00:05:38,054
If I don't get
off the Cloud Palace,

156
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:40,190
I'll never get home
for school tomorrow,

157
00:05:40,224 --> 00:05:42,859
but the Toad Spirit
has Aunt Ginzee!

158
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:44,093
(gasps)

159
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:46,129
(humming nervously)

160
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:52,168
"Scientists prove
cat heaven real,

161
00:05:52,203 --> 00:05:53,803
human heaven not!"

162
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:56,172
(gasps)
That's so sad!

163
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:58,041
Those are joke
headlines.

164
00:05:58,075 --> 00:05:59,843
It's not a real
newspaper,

165
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:01,911
it's just satire.

166
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:04,681
Oh... satire!

167
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,419
And these fake movie
reviews are so mean,

168
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,055
it's hilarious!
(laughs)

169
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:14,190
Oh, those <i>are</i> real.

170
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:16,359
Great paper.

171
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:18,828
Maggie's a little hungry.

172
00:06:18,863 --> 00:06:20,830
Oh, you can go
ahead and feed her.

173
00:06:20,865 --> 00:06:23,600
Corduroy could
probably use a snack.

174
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:24,868
(suckling)

175
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:28,571
Hmm, that's not
applesauce.

176
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:30,707
Oh, uh, you don't have
to be uncomfortable

177
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,542
around another
nursing mom.

178
00:06:32,576 --> 00:06:35,111
Breast-feeding's
just a healthy thing we all do.

179
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,779
It sure is!

180
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:40,533
There's nothing
more natural than... that.

181
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,402
It's just that
Maggie's already...

182
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:46,072
milked me today.
(nervous laugh)

183
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,607
Homer, I think we should go.

184
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,075
We're not like these people.

185
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,260
(gasps)

186
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:51,611
Check out my new look.

187
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,279
Terence shaved my head.

188
00:06:53,314 --> 00:06:54,964
You're all bald!

189
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:57,967
No, I'm young-person <i>cool</i> bald!

190
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:00,136
Not old-person sad bald.

191
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,772
I never want
to see these again!

192
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:05,441
(groans)

193
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:11,103
Check it out,
Flanders!

194
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:14,506
Us cool dads
are sharing a mono-yard!

195
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,909
Guess I can't be
your best friend anymore.

196
00:07:16,943 --> 00:07:19,662
(chuckles) To be honest, that comes
as a tremendous relief.

197
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:21,680
Boo-hoo-hoo!
You could cry all night,

198
00:07:21,731 --> 00:07:23,782
it's not gonna win me back!

199
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:27,870
(gate creaks)

200
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:31,140
(gasps)
I can finally compost!

201
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:33,359
(Lisa humming happily)

202
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,595
Maybe we shouldn't rush things
with the new neighbors.

203
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,032
You know, we might not
all be a perfect match.

204
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:41,984
I have a plan to
deal with that.

205
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:43,936
Step one: Change everything
about ourselves

206
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,871
until we are
super-cool. The end.

207
00:07:45,905 --> 00:07:48,674
But I always thought
you <i>were</i> cool.

208
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,309
Honey, I'm not cool.

209
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:51,510
I was never cool.

210
00:07:51,544 --> 00:07:53,045
I didn't go to college.

211
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:55,881
Every CD I have, I
bought at a car wash.

212
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:57,683
Black-and-white films
make me angry.

213
00:07:57,717 --> 00:07:59,468
I can't pronounce "artisanal."

214
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:02,321
I only know David Cross
from the Chipmunks movie.

215
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:04,323
Not only do I <i>like</i> Van Halen,

216
00:08:04,357 --> 00:08:06,492
but I think they keep
getting better.

217
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:07,660
Oh...

218
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:09,295
But if me and
my kids do

219
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:11,363
the same stuff as
Terence and his kids,

220
00:08:11,398 --> 00:08:14,249
I could be
a cool dad.

221
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:17,336
Well, sweetie, if it's
that important to you,

222
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,638
I guess we can try.

223
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:22,374
Thanks, baby. Here,
have a bracelet

224
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:24,843
made of a '70s
educational film strip.

225
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:27,346
Ooh, hygiene!

226
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,614
♪ Yeah, it's a real cool club

227
00:08:28,648 --> 00:08:31,083
♪ And you're not part of it

228
00:08:32,118 --> 00:08:34,086
♪ Yeah, it's a real cool club

229
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,288
♪ And you'll never be
a part of it. ♪

230
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:41,727
MARGE: <i>Your father took you to a</i>
<i>Korean gangster film festival?</i>

231
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:43,996
Yeah, it was great!
This one guy was part

232
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,048
of another guy's gang--
I mean, <i>kkangpae--</i>

233
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:48,367
but then he quit and
joined another <i>kkangpae,</i>

234
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:50,219
and when the guys in the
first <i>kkangpae</i> found out,

235
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:52,271
they were so mad they put
his feet in a blender!

236
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:54,723
Then they cut to a guy eating
noodles, and blood splashed on him!

237
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:57,026
At the art walk,
we walked into a gallery,

238
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,761
and it was just
a guy crying.

239
00:08:58,795 --> 00:09:00,829
That was the art!

240
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:01,897
(growls)

241
00:09:01,931 --> 00:09:03,766
The kids are a mess!

242
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,802
You brought them
home exhausted and pretentious!

243
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:09,405
No, we need to take kids
to grown-up stuff.

244
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:12,241
That's Terence's
parenting style.

245
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:14,626
Parenting shouldn't
have a style!

246
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:16,795
Parenting is
about bedtimes,

247
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,947
and passwords
on computers,

248
00:09:18,982 --> 00:09:20,816
and complicated
punishments

249
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,284
you never follow
through on!

250
00:09:22,318 --> 00:09:25,120
Are you wearing
a wallet chain?

251
00:09:25,155 --> 00:09:27,423
You look like...
a barista!

252
00:09:27,457 --> 00:09:29,475
Well, you won't be
laughing when you see

253
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:31,777
how many pickpockets
this thing catches.

254
00:09:31,811 --> 00:09:33,278
And what's with
the scarf?

255
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:35,381
It's soaked in
neck sweat!

256
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:37,449
Wearing scarves
in non-scarf weather

257
00:09:37,484 --> 00:09:39,451
is the essence of cool.

258
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:41,120
The essence!

259
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:43,372
Ooh.

260
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:47,760
Aw, man, my goatee
has barely come in!

261
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:50,629
Why does my hair
only grow in twos?

262
00:09:50,663 --> 00:09:53,599
Oh, I hope T-Rex likes
the present I made him.

263
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:56,468
Made? Why didn't you
just buy him a toy?

264
00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:59,838
(sighs) Homemade presents
are how cool families

265
00:09:59,873 --> 00:10:02,141
demonstrate how
awesome they are.

266
00:10:02,175 --> 00:10:05,444
If I show up with a toy...

267
00:10:05,478 --> 00:10:07,413
from the store...

268
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:10,182
like we would
give our kids...

269
00:10:10,216 --> 00:10:11,683
then I've failed!

270
00:10:11,718 --> 00:10:16,088
And these skinny jeans will have
flattened my junk for nothing!

271
00:10:16,122 --> 00:10:18,524
(rock playing)

272
00:10:22,128 --> 00:10:24,029
Geez, is this a kid's
birthday party,

273
00:10:24,063 --> 00:10:25,764
or the place a bad guy

274
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,549
kidnaps you to
in a movie?

275
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:30,119
Yeah, this factory
used to make blimp tires.

276
00:10:30,153 --> 00:10:33,522
T-Rex <i>loves</i> decaying
industrial-scapes.

277
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:35,357
I used to.
Now I'm into

278
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,059
abandoned ethnic
union halls.

279
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:39,294
Come on, dude,
this party rocks!

280
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:41,497
<i>Love</i> the temporary-
tattoo station!

281
00:10:41,531 --> 00:10:43,799
(chuckles):
Uh, temporary?

282
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,534
I want kitty whiskers!

283
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:47,302
You got it.

284
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:50,472
There's got to be a bounce house
around here somewhere.

285
00:10:50,506 --> 00:10:53,525
At least maybe a pinata?

286
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:58,046
(loud suckling)

287
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:00,249
Holy aureole!

288
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:02,217
Please, join our
milk circle.

289
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:03,719
I'd love to,

290
00:11:03,753 --> 00:11:06,238
but Maggie's
a little shy.

291
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:09,875
Oh, don't worry--
you can use a nursing apron.

292
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:11,877
Play along.

293
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:14,980
Oh, this couldn't
feel more natural.

294
00:11:15,014 --> 00:11:16,682
Glug, glug, glug.

295
00:11:16,716 --> 00:11:18,283
That's a good
little mammal.

296
00:11:20,453 --> 00:11:21,587
(all gasp)

297
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:22,955
A bottle?!

298
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:24,056
Plastic!

299
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,207
Formula!

300
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:27,092
That is so wrong.

301
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:31,029
Fine, I admit it,
you nipple Nazis.

302
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:32,898
I give my baby formula.

303
00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:34,433
(all gasping)

304
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:36,368
It's okay. If you don't
want to breast-feed

305
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:38,420
your baby, we will.

306
00:11:40,773 --> 00:11:42,441
Stay back.
(woman gasp)

307
00:11:42,475 --> 00:11:44,026
You know I'll use this.

308
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,460
Because you saw me using it.

309
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:47,462
(women whimpering)

310
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:51,266
Huh, 1950s
Pontiac Accordion Camera.

311
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:54,937
I could always use
another one of these.

312
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:57,072
Bowling shoes.

313
00:11:57,106 --> 00:11:59,541
Not vintage, but you know,
in a pinch.

314
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:03,946
"Dino-Cool"

315
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,083
Oh, I get it-- a T-Rex
for the T-Rex.

316
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:10,219
How long did it take him
to think of that one?

317
00:12:10,253 --> 00:12:11,503
(boys laughing)
Oh, man.

318
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:13,839
Hey, my dad worked
really hard to make that.

319
00:12:13,873 --> 00:12:16,174
He took a class
to learn denim painting.

320
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:17,609
(sighs)
This is so pathetic.

321
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:20,262
I can't even wear it
<i>ironically</i> ironically.

322
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:24,483
This guy's going
on my "Poser Tumblr."

323
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:26,602

00:12:26,636 --> 00:12:28,704

00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:32,257
No one bad mouths
my dad except me.

326
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:34,126
(both grunting)

327
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,111
Hey, dude!

329
00:12:39,832 --> 00:12:41,833

(boys grunting, Marge gasping)

331
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:46,421
Your son attacked mine.

332
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:47,990
You've turned this
former slaughterhouse

333
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:49,992
into a place of violence.

334
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:51,560
I thought it made blimp tires.

335
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:54,129
Yeah, like factories
are never repurposed.

336
00:12:54,147 --> 00:12:55,831
(yells)

337
00:12:55,865 --> 00:12:58,066
It's time for you guys
to leave.

338
00:12:58,101 --> 00:13:00,235
Are we still on
for midnight bike riding?

339
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,937

340
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:08,643
(bell rings)

341
00:13:08,661 --> 00:13:12,281
Feeling included
is life's greatest joy.

342
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:14,166
HOMER:

00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,109
Oh-ho-ho, boy, oh, boy.

345
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:24,378
Have you been
"oh boy"-ing all night?

346
00:13:24,413 --> 00:13:27,248
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho, boy.

347
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:30,351
We had the family version
of a bro-mance going

348
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:33,788
with our awesome neighbors
and you had to screw it up.

349
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:35,723
Look, that kid threw your
present in the garbage,

350
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:38,058
and he called you a poser,
and everyone laughed.

351
00:13:38,093 --> 00:13:40,394
He called me a poser?

352
