2
00:00:06,761 --> 00:00:09,796
(shouting gibberish)

3
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:14,274
According to our Mayan calendar,

4
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:16,443
the world will be destroyed

5
00:00:16,477 --> 00:00:19,045
at the end of
the 13th <i>baktun.</i>

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,882
Unless we appease the gods'
anger with a human sacrifice.

7
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:25,919
Don't worry. We got a guy here
we really been fattening up.

8
00:00:25,953 --> 00:00:27,220
Is it you?

9
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:29,055
Not me. That guy.

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,724
More cricket fajitas!

11
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:33,059
Oh, my brave,
brave glutton.

12
00:00:33,094 --> 00:00:36,830
I'll be so lonely when they
sacrifice you to the gods.

13
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,199
(loud spit)
What?!

14
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:41,151
No one said anything
about a sacrifice!

15
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:44,504
Although I... I did kind of
space out during orientation.

16
00:00:44,538 --> 00:00:46,222
All right already,
let's get this done

17
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:48,858
while our doomed civilization
is still flourishing here.

18
00:00:48,893 --> 00:00:50,860
Oh. Any words of comfort?

19
00:00:50,895 --> 00:00:53,063
Oh, yeah, sure. Even though
you know it's coming,

20
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:54,731
when you see
your own beating heart,

21
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:56,166
try to act surprised, huh?

22
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,700
It's some kid's first time.

23
00:00:57,735 --> 00:01:00,136
Fear not, my beloved
blood offering.

24
00:01:00,171 --> 00:01:02,055
(quietly):
I have a plan.

25
00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:03,823
Tell me, High Priest,

26
00:01:03,858 --> 00:01:06,326
are you interested in women?

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,660
What priest isn't?

28
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:09,062
Before we make love,

29
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:11,498
would you mind putting
a sack over your head?

30
00:01:11,532 --> 00:01:14,167
Is there any other way?
(chuckles)

31
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:15,318
Nice and tight.

32
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:17,520
Now enter the Room of Pleasure,
Ooh.

33
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:19,572
and I shall join you shortly.

34
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:24,110
Now, uh, I got to warn you.
I'm into rough stuff.

35
00:01:24,145 --> 00:01:26,613
Ooh, that's a good start,
but, you know, make it hurt.

36
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:28,114
(sword whooshes)
Heh. Ooh!

37
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:31,201
That whooshing sound
is <i>really</i> turning me...

38
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:33,353
Oh!

39
00:01:33,387 --> 00:01:35,221
Uh. Oh, yeah. Ah.

40
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:37,290
(grunting)

41
00:01:37,324 --> 00:01:39,225
(groans)

42
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,177
(kids laughing)

43
00:01:41,212 --> 00:01:43,630
Man, soccer's even boring
for the ball.

44
00:01:43,664 --> 00:01:44,964
Quetzal H. Coatl!

45
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:46,800
We sacrificed the wrong person!

46
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:50,370
Now the earth <i>will</i> be destroyed
after the 13th <i>baktun.</i>

47
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:53,306
(shouting): Can you explain
that in simple Ancient Mayan?!

48
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,475
Of course. There's no
need to shout and scream.

49
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,709
Let's see, uh,

50
00:01:56,744 --> 00:01:58,378
converting to base 10,

51
00:01:58,412 --> 00:02:01,147
assuming for the birth of Jesus,

52
00:02:01,182 --> 00:02:04,184
invent and then
carry the leap year,

53
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:07,887
and the world will end in 2012!

54
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:08,988
(relieved sighs)

55
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:11,457
And it will be
Obama's fault!

56
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:15,428
(dramatic theme plays)

57
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:19,065
Hey, uh, Marge,
I'm setting my watch.

58
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:20,333
What <i>baktun</i> is it?

59
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:22,101
13th!
Oh!

60
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:23,770
(doorbell rings)

61
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:26,906
Oh! What have we here?

62
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:29,926
Ow!

63
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:41,154

(yelling)

71
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:22,086
QUIMBY: Welcome to the grand
opening of our whatchamacallit,

72
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,756
which, thanks to the lobbying
of Lisa Simpson,

73
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,358
we built instead
of a new baseball stadium.

74
00:03:27,392 --> 00:03:29,310
At least the pennant
works both ways.

75
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:33,080
Professor Frink will now throw
a switch, which will either

76
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:36,634
answer certain obscure
questions of subatomic physics

77
00:03:36,668 --> 00:03:39,287
or destroy the universe.

78
00:03:39,321 --> 00:03:41,489
(electrical humming)

79
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:44,826

80
00:03:46,762 --> 00:03:49,297
Oh, my God particle!

81
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:50,832
What is it, Professor?

82
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:53,468
You can tell your
grandchildren you were here

83
00:03:53,502 --> 00:03:56,571
when humanity finally learned
that this accelerator

84
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:59,140
is much too small to tell
us anything important.

85
00:03:59,174 --> 00:04:00,441
(crowd groans)

86
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:02,243
Thanks a lot, Liser!

87
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:05,046
That money could've been used
for a war!

88

99
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,976
Huh?

100

(slurping)

101
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:40,281
(gasps) A mini
black hole!

102
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:41,282
(slurps)

103
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:43,551
Whee...!

104
00:04:43,585 --> 00:04:45,553
Oh, no! I got to take it away

105
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:47,622
before more clueless kids
fall into it.

106
00:04:47,656 --> 00:04:49,323

00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,328
HOMER:
Lisa, do you

114
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:12,396
have a stray dog down there?

115
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:15,333
Um, it's a lot worse
than a stray dog.

116
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:16,734
<i>Two</i> stray dogs?!

117
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:17,869
It's a black hole!

118
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:19,503
That was gonna be
my next guess.

119
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:21,322
Are you sure
your next guess wasn't

120
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:22,990
<i>three</i> stray dogs?

121
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:24,242
Maybe.

122
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,827
HOMER:
A black hole?!

123
00:05:26,862 --> 00:05:29,030
(hushed): I'm sorry,
can we call it that?

124
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:31,182
Yes. It's
the preferred term.

125
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:33,584
And most scientists believe
that what enters a black hole

126
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:35,186
never comes out.

127
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,322
But some think they may be
a gateway to other universes.

128
00:05:38,357 --> 00:05:40,508
Hey! Could it open
a pretzel bag for me?

129
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,009
Help a brother out, B.H.

130
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:43,444
Whoo-hoo!

131
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:44,712
D'oh!

132
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:50,551
Guys! Stop throwing
things in the hole!

133
00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:52,052
The more you throw in,
the bigger

134
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,055
and more dangerous it becomes!

135
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:57,425
Come on. You can't look at that
infinitely dense little guy

136
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:59,410
and not want
to feed it <i>something.</i>

137
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:00,711
Dad, don't pat it!

138
00:06:00,746 --> 00:06:02,246
Why shouldn't...

141
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:08,920
(quiet choking) (gasps) I'm nature's
perfect choking machine!

142
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:10,705
(loud grunt)
Okay, that's it!

143
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:13,307
I'm putting a baby gate
across the black hole.

144
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:16,294
And don't throw
anything more into it!

145
00:06:16,328 --> 00:06:18,412
(groans)
Yes, Homer?

146
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,097

147
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:22,082

to throwing things in?

00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:10,831
No.
Not me.

165
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:12,299
Do we even still
have that thing?

166
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:15,453

has anyone seen the cat?

it could reach critical mass.

00:08:02,784 --> 00:08:04,785
I hit my first home run!

182
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,953
LISA:
No...!

183
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:07,154
(people screaming)

184
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,689
I'm still proud
of you, buddy.

185
00:08:08,724 --> 00:08:12,326
And look! I got money
to take you for pizza!

186
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,462
You saw that I had
the money, right?

187
00:08:16,898 --> 00:08:18,899
(grunting)

188
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:23,904
(gunshot)

189
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,372
(chuckling)

190
00:08:25,407 --> 00:08:26,974
(yelling)

191
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:31,178
(grunting)

192
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:34,081
(screaming)

193
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:39,770
(thud, suckling)

194
00:08:40,856 --> 00:08:42,423
(debris clattering)

195
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:45,409
(suckling)

196
00:08:46,545 --> 00:08:48,579
(all yelling)

197
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:50,981
(gasping)

198
00:08:51,016 --> 00:08:52,349
(grunting)

199
00:08:52,384 --> 00:08:54,902
Welcome, trans-
dimensional visitors.

200
00:08:54,936 --> 00:08:59,240
We have received
your many gifts with gratitude.

201
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:01,342
NELSON:
Haw-haw!

202
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:04,645
We have built our society around
the treasures you have sent.

203
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,430
Our most popular
magazine is

204
00:09:06,465 --> 00:09:09,300
your Presidents' Day
Mattress Blowout insert.

205
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:13,604
Oufarite food
is your banana peel.

206
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:14,805
(slurps)

207
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,774
And we listen to
all our music

208
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:19,443
on the most wonderful
device ever created,

209
00:09:19,478 --> 00:09:20,811
the Zune.

210
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:23,747
(chanting):
Zune, Zune, Zune.

211
00:09:23,782 --> 00:09:25,649
Treasures? Gifts?
You've got it all wrong.

212
00:09:25,684 --> 00:09:27,551
That stuff is
just our old...

213
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:30,504
Wonderful stuff.  Enjoy it.
ALIENS: Zune.

214
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:38,097
(dramatic theme plays)

215
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:41,767
Day 1: We bought this camera
because strange things

216
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:45,638
have been going on at our house
in the dead of night.

217
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:52,444
And if anyone finds this footage
after we're all missing or dead,

218
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,663
remember me as a hero.
Dad,

219
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:56,932
you forgot to pick me up
after Little League.

220
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:59,668
You tossed your car keys
in my bean plant.

221
00:09:59,703 --> 00:10:01,103
A hero!

222
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:02,905
FLANDERS:
Homer, is that my camera?

223
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:04,473
Hero, away!

224
00:10:05,508 --> 00:10:07,543
Night 1.

225
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:10,279
Want to snuggle?

226
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:11,580
(smooching)

227
00:10:11,615 --> 00:10:13,582
Not with the camera on.

228
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:14,850
Uh, I turned
it off.

229
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:16,585
Looks like
the red light's on.

230
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,455
I swear I am
not filming!

231
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:22,925
(whispering loudly): Note to self--
edit out my lies.

232
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,627
Oh!

233
00:10:27,063 --> 00:10:30,783
(tape fast-forwarding)

234
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:32,501
(door creaks)

235
00:10:34,371 --> 00:10:36,205
(door creaks)

236
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:41,176
(loud thumping)

237
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,597
(tape fast-forwarding)

238
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,184
(loud thud downstairs)
(whimpering)

239
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:50,519
(both yelp)

240
00:10:50,553 --> 00:10:52,221
Wait! Don't kill the
monster without me!

241
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:54,006
(Marge screams)

242
00:10:54,024 --> 00:10:56,625
HOMER: I'm right behind you,
honey! We have stairs?

243
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,394
(thumping)
Ow! D'oh! Aah! D'oh!

244
00:10:58,445 --> 00:10:59,778
(continues grunting, thumping)

245
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:01,563
What the...?
Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ooh!

246
00:11:01,614 --> 00:11:03,732
(continues grunting, thumping)

247
00:11:05,785 --> 00:11:07,186
(flames crackling)

248
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,821
HOMER:
What the...?

249
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:11,490
(gasping breaths)

250
00:11:11,524 --> 00:11:13,726
Why is this happening to us?!

251
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,729
I don't know, I don't know!
I'm sure I don't know!

252
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:18,364
HOMER:
Oh, sweetie.

253
00:11:18,398 --> 00:11:21,233
Sometimes a mysterious,
invisible being from Hell

254
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:24,036
waits for a family to go
to sleep then kills them.

255
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,404
Now, go to bed.
But...

256
00:11:25,438 --> 00:11:27,089
Uh-uh. School night.

257
00:11:27,123 --> 00:11:30,225
Now, you're sure
I bought enough cameras

258
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,177
and extended warranties
to catch that ghost?

259
00:11:32,211 --> 00:11:33,712
Sir, whatever happens
in this house,

260
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,347
these cameras
will pick it up.

261
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:37,132
Ooh, I can't wait
for tonight's massacre.

262
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:52,281
(tape fast-forwarding)

263
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:57,720
Hey, Marge.
(low grunt): Mmm...

264
00:11:57,754 --> 00:11:59,855
Oh. Like
what you see, huh?

265
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:01,457
(low grunt):
Mmm...

266
00:12:01,491 --> 00:12:03,692
I like it when
you don't say words.

267
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:05,561
Come here, you.
Mmm...

268
00:12:05,595 --> 00:12:08,364
(chuckles)
Mmm...

269
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:11,300
(singing a melody)

270
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:12,634
(tape fast-forwarding)

271
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:16,271
(continues singing melody)

272
00:12:22,946 --> 00:12:24,897
(tape fast-forwarding)

273
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:27,299
(continues singing melody)

274
00:12:29,803 --> 00:12:31,136
Eh, eh.

275
00:12:31,171 --> 00:12:33,255
Yeah, that's hellfire,
all right.

276
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,908
Someone in this family
has made a deal with the devil,

277
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:38,010
and now the devil
wants his due.

278
00:12:38,044 --> 00:12:40,479
Now, remember, this creature
feeds on your fear...

279
00:12:40,513 --> 00:12:42,798
(cuckoo clock chimes)
What the hell was that?!

280
00:12:42,832 --> 00:12:44,750
(sobbing loudly)

281
00:12:44,784 --> 00:12:47,953
Actually, he feeds on
more than just fear.

282
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:52,624
(door creaks)

283
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:54,660
(wind whistling)

284
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:04,470
Give back my baby!

285
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:06,004
DEMON:
We had a deal!

286
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,940
Mom, what's
going on?!

287
00:13:07,974 --> 00:13:09,842
DEMON: Don't act so
surprised, Marge.

288
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,543
You knew this
day was coming!

289
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:13,195
Let's see what
we're dealing with here.

290
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:14,430
(grunts)

291
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:16,165
It's Moe with wings!

292
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:17,983
Moe Szyslak?

293
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:20,702
Come on, he's much more
hideous and evil than <i>me!</i>

294
00:13:20,737 --> 00:13:22,037
(all agreeing)

295
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:25,340
(crying):
I brought this on us all.

296
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,876
It began when
I was a girl...

297
00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:33,699
(deep grunting)

298
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:35,300
(in unison):
Hail Satan.

299
00:13:35,335 --> 00:13:37,736
What are you doing?
Trying to summon the devil.

300
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,538
Why?
Nothing good on TV.

301
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:40,906
We have no boyfriends.

302
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,808
We're bored.
Something to do.

303
00:13:42,842 --> 00:13:45,978
Hail Satan,
the Minister of Sinister,

304
00:13:46,012 --> 00:13:48,497
Rude Dude with a Bad 'Tude.

305
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:51,967
(Selma and Patty grunting,
choking)

306
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:53,936
(gasps)
Save us, Marge.

307
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,371
We'll never make fun
of any man you date or marry.

308
00:13:56,406 --> 00:13:58,440
Mmm. Uh, Mr. Demon?
Mmm?

309
00:13:58,475 --> 00:14:01,026
Could you... come back
for my sisters later?

310
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,377
(Selma and Patty grunting)

311
00:14:02,412 --> 00:14:04,713
Very well.
You have 30 years.

312
00:14:04,747 --> 00:14:06,248
But when I return, Marge,

313
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:09,084
I shall take
your favorite child.

314
00:14:09,118 --> 00:14:12,087
I thought I was
the favorite!

315
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:14,389
Not the favorite!
Not the favorite!

316
00:14:14,424 --> 00:14:16,788
Listen, pal, you seem
like an honest guy.

317
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:17,593
Mm.

318
00:14:17,594 --> 00:14:21,063
Is there any other deal
that you can accept?

319
00:14:21,097 --> 00:14:22,664
Three-way.

320
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:24,600
Hmm. You,
me and Marge?

321
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:26,668
Mmm, demon,
demon, you.

322
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:30,772
(heavy sigh) I guess it's one of those
things a dad has to do.

323
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:32,941
Now, before we start,
what's the safe word?

324
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:34,243
Cinnamon.

325
00:14:34,277 --> 00:14:35,711
Ooh, I like that.

326
00:14:35,745 --> 00:14:38,413
Now, I'd like to try something
new, if you don't mind.

327
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:41,016
(laughs) Cinnamon. Cinnamon.
Cinnamon! Cinnamon!

328
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:49,945
You know, it's
really not fair.

329
00:14:49,979 --> 00:14:51,747
You're charging 200
bucks for a comic

330
00:14:51,781 --> 00:14:53,615
that says 25 cents
on the cover.

331
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,251
The only way to buy that
comic book for 25 cents

332
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:58,170
is to go back to 1974.

333
00:14:58,204 --> 00:14:59,805
That's impossible!

334
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,006
Mmm?

335
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,108
(quietly):
Or <i>is</i> it?

336
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:08,981
(zapping)

337
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,317
Wow, it worked!

338
00:15:12,352 --> 00:15:13,919
My time machine has worked!

339
00:15:13,953 --> 00:15:17,122
This is the most fantastically
powerful invention

340
00:15:17,156 --> 00:15:19,424
in mankind's history!

341
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:20,626
Here, kid, hold my keys

342
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,160
while I grab
some lunch.

343
00:15:22,195 --> 00:15:24,196
(humming)

344
00:15:27,534 --> 00:15:29,918
(whirring)

345
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:31,753
(zapping)

346
00:15:31,788 --> 00:15:33,789
♪ ♪

347
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:45,734
1974!

348
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:47,669
I won't be needing this!

349
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:50,255
(zapping)

350
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:57,579
Now to get my comic book
and explore a world

351
00:15:57,614 --> 00:15:59,565
where no one's mad
at George Lucas.

352
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:01,700
(humming happily)

353
00:16:01,734 --> 00:16:04,219
Eh, pretty good.
A little preachy.

354
00:16:04,253 --> 00:16:06,438
MAN: Well, well, well, if
it isn't Homer Simpson

355
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:09,241
and Barney Gumble.
Hmm?

356
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:11,643
Allow me, gentlemen.

357
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:14,079
It's Homer!
Before his boobs came in!

358
00:16:18,184 --> 00:16:20,602
(Homer whistling)

359
00:16:20,637 --> 00:16:22,204
Hey, Homer.
Who are you?

360
00:16:22,238 --> 00:16:24,106
I'm your unwanted son
from the future

361
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,707
who killed all your fun!

362
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:28,243
Why, you little...
(grunting)

363
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,380
Excuse me.
Is this room 106?

364
00:16:31,414 --> 00:16:35,133
(instrumental version
of "Close to You" playing)

365
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:37,085
(choking)

366
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,687
Let go of him!

367
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:40,689
What kind of jerk
strangles a little boy?!

368
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:42,691
Would you go to
the prom with me?

369
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:44,760
Promenade? With <i>you?</i>

370
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:46,995
Forget it, bub!
(grunts)

371
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:51,300
It was love at first sight,
and you ruined it!

372
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:53,368
It was <i>not</i> love
at first sight!

373
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:54,770
What do you know?

374
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:56,288
I know who I'm in love with!

375
00:16:56,322 --> 00:16:58,056
You're looking at him.
You're an idiot.

376
00:16:58,091 --> 00:16:59,908
You're the idiot!
(gasps)

377
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:02,577
Don't act like I'm the first
person that ever said that.

378
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:05,080
You <i>are</i> the first person
who ever said that!

379
00:17:05,114 --> 00:17:06,915
Shut up and go
to the prom with me!

380
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:08,800
<i>Ay, caramba!</i> If you guys
don't get together,

381
00:17:08,835 --> 00:17:11,737
what does that mean for me
in the future?

382
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:15,557
(gasps)
I don't exist?!

383
00:17:15,591 --> 00:17:17,225
<i>Or</i> my life

384
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,062
might be a hell of a lot better!

385
00:17:20,096 --> 00:17:23,065
Ma'am, whatever you do,
do not marry that ape.

386
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,901
Mmm.

387
00:17:25,935 --> 00:17:29,054
Whatever you say,
little boy.

388
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:30,222
(laughing)
(growling)

389
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:31,406
Come here!

390
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:35,310
Now, to return to a future
where I'm either rich

391
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,679
or allowed to stand in front
of a rich guy's house.

392
00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:39,681
Either way, better than now.

393
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:42,317
(whirring)

394
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,635
(tires screeching, zapping)

395
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:47,906
(Bart laughing)

396
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,292
Stupid kid steals my future.

397
00:17:50,326 --> 00:17:51,643
Well, I'm going to...

398
00:17:51,678 --> 00:17:54,046
(gasps):
Ice cream with cookie dough?!

399
00:17:55,331 --> 00:17:57,833
Unnecessarily big TVs!

400
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:00,268
Thursday <i>Night Football?</i>

401
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:02,938
And the globe feels so warm!

402
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:05,607
I am in awe of the future.

403
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:09,177
(Wiggum snoring, muttering)

404
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:11,213
Okay, that's not so great.

405
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:16,518
Here's your smoothie,
sweetheart.

406
00:18:16,552 --> 00:18:20,439
Why would I suck smoothie
when I can suck face with you,

407
00:18:20,473 --> 00:18:22,441
Mrs. Artie Ziff?

408
00:18:22,475 --> 00:18:25,961
(both moaning)

409
00:18:25,995 --> 00:18:27,979
My dad is Artie Ziff?

410
00:18:28,014 --> 00:18:30,449
Indeed! Which makes <i>you</i>

411
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:31,850
Barty Ziff.

412
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,787
<i>Oy, caramba!</i>

413
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:37,723
Achem!

414
00:18:37,757 --> 00:18:39,691
Good morning,
beloved son.

415
00:18:39,726 --> 00:18:41,543
Enjoy your
luxurious life,

416
00:18:41,577 --> 00:18:44,079
including your own
bully butler.

417
00:18:44,113 --> 00:18:46,715
Will that be
haw-haw, sir?

418
00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:47,966
Give yourself a wedgie.

419
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,002
Excellent choice.
(grunts)

420
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:53,505
I've met some jive turkeys
in the '70s,

421
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:55,140
but that turkey's the jivest.

422
00:18:55,174 --> 00:18:57,242
Hey, you! This is
<i>my</i> peeping tree.

423
00:18:57,276 --> 00:18:59,811
Young me? What brings
you to the present?

424
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:02,581
I traveled through space and
time to make Marge settle for me

425
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:04,015
because she doesn't know better.

426
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,218
Well, if we put
our heads together,

427
00:19:06,252 --> 00:19:07,853
we could think
of a plan!

428
00:19:09,222 --> 00:19:11,823
I got to ask,
what happened?

429
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:14,359
Was I in a forest
fire or something?

430
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:16,695
No

431
00:19:16,729 --> 00:19:17,863
(whip cracking)

432
00:19:17,897 --> 00:19:19,047
I love my life,
I love it not.

433
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:20,348
I love my life, I love it not.

434
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:22,584
You're just like
Indiana Jones, son.

435
00:19:22,618 --> 00:19:25,420
A role played by Richard
Dreyfuss in <i>our</i> universe.

436
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,888
(doorbell rings)

437
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,858
I'm here to take
my life back!

438
00:19:29,892 --> 00:19:32,093
I thought this
might happen,

439
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:35,964
so I mastered
Brazilian jujitsu.

440
00:19:35,998 --> 00:19:38,517
Crawl atop me,
and meet your doom!

441
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:40,252
Not so fast.

442
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:42,087
Say hello
to the United Federation

443
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:45,457
of Homers
Through History.

444
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:49,194
(Italian accent):
Crush them...

445
00:19:49,228 --> 00:19:51,463
in the name of Jebus!

446
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,421
Okay, guys,
let's regroup.

447
00:19:59,455 --> 00:20:00,789
We'll come back with more Homers

448
00:20:00,823 --> 00:20:02,157
and start fresh in the morning.

449
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:04,609
(yelps)

450
00:20:06,012 --> 00:20:08,763
("Close to You" plays)

451
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:14,286
(unimpressed):
Oh, what's <i>she</i> doing here?

452
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,754
I'll tell you
what I'm doing.

453
00:20:15,788 --> 00:20:19,224
I'm realizing that
I married the wrong man.

454
00:20:19,537 --> 00:20:23,657
Oh, you poor, sweet,
simple Homers.

455
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:26,493
I was supposed to be
with all of you!

456
00:20:26,528 --> 00:20:29,329
(grunting gibberish)

457
00:20:29,364 --> 00:20:31,331
Even you, Caveman Homer.

458
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:32,566
That's Renaissance Homer.

459
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,434
Well, cardinal
or cannibal,

460
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:38,272
I wish that 20 years ago,
I had chosen love.

461
00:20:38,306 --> 00:20:39,673
Mmm...

462
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:42,826
Let me get
this straight.

463
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:45,896
None of you had time
to take out the garbage?

464
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,915
Make Egyptian Slave
Homer do it.

465
00:20:47,949 --> 00:20:50,350
It's always me.

466
00:20:50,385 --> 00:20:52,619
(laughing in unison)

467
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:54,771
(screams)

468
00:20:54,806 --> 00:20:56,456
(eerie organ music plays)

470
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,780
(aah!)
