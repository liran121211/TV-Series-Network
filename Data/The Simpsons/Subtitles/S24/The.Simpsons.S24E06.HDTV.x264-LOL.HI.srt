BASEBALL ANNOUNCER:
It's the World Series, two outs,

17
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,368
bottom of the ninth.

18
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:11,670
Yes, we're at the point

19
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,972
where baseball becomes
mildly interesting.

20
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:17,309
Can Homer Simpson,
fresh off an anxiety dream

21
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,344
about not studying
for a high school test,

22
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:22,547
come into this dream
and knock one out of the park?

23
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,316
And who'da thunk it?

24
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,750
We're food too!

25
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:28,236
And apparently I'm married
to a pork chop

26
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:30,405
and have drumstick children.

27
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,407
How did that happen?

28
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:35,310
(snoring)

29
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:36,878
BASEBALL ANNOUNCER: We're back...
(belches)

30
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:39,064
The pitcher,
Steroid Santa Claus,

31
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,699
kicks and deals.

32
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,985
It's a long fly ball,
going back! Back!

33
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:46,154
And the ball shatters the sky,

34
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:49,624
bringing the ocean itself
down into the stadium!

35
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:53,378
Whoa, Simpson just broke this
dream's reality wide open!

36
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:55,830
The groundskeepers are
trying to put on the tarp,

37
00:01:55,864 --> 00:01:59,384
but it turned into a manta ray
and stung them all.

38
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:02,070
Now, we'll be right back
after this word from oxygen,

39
00:02:02,104 --> 00:02:04,706
which Homer desperately
needs to live.

40
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,241
(gurgling)

41
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,276

MARGE:
Homer! The roof is leaking!

43
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:13,815
Water's coming in the house,

44
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:15,650
and we've got carpet mushrooms.

45
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,989
Dad, all the jury summons
you buried in the back yard

46
00:02:21,023 --> 00:02:22,257
are coming back up.

47
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,045
(humming)

48
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:31,566
While you were out
there daydreaming,

49
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,351
this rain has ruined the house.

50
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,786
(sighs deeply)

51
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,905
Marge, in a crisis like this,

52
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:39,607
I need time for
quiet contemplation.

53
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,414
What's wrong, Homer?

54
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,633
You got an expression on your
face I ain't never seen before.

55
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:51,019
Like one of them Charlie Brown
wiggle-frowns.

56
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:55,190
I'm in an abusive
relationship with life.

57
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:56,791
It keeps beating
the hell out of me,

58
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:58,443
and I'm too cowardly
to leave it.

59
00:02:58,477 --> 00:02:59,611
(sighs)

60
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:01,613
Maybe I could drink myself
to death.

61
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:02,981
Eh, well, you can't.

62
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:04,549
Your tolerance is too high.

63
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:09,454
Man, I've never seen Homer
looking this bad.

64
00:03:11,757 --> 00:03:12,874
You're right.

65
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:14,893
He needs some
professional help.

66
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,796
♪ Oh yeah...

67
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:22,667
Ooh, someone is
down in the Duff!

68
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,136
Life is too fragile.

69
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,872
One minute you're lying in
your hammock drinking beer,

70
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:31,910
the next thing you know you're
sittin' here drinkin' beer.

71
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:36,314
Homer, your bleak outlook has
sent a smooth, icy chill down...

72
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:38,483
Ah, screw it. I quit.

73
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:40,752
Janette, Cheryl,
get your own ride home.

74
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:47,642
Aw, come on, Chief.
I've had a rotten day.

75
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,927
Can't you help me out?

76
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:50,795
Sorry, I'm afraid
the most I can do

77
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,230
is pretend to drive you home.

78
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:55,050
Okay, now hop on my
imaginary motorcycle...

79
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:56,668
arms around my belly...

80
00:03:56,702 --> 00:03:59,687
(imitates motorcycle revving)

81
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:02,490
Um, I'm gonna need you
to chip in for gas.

82
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:03,892
Argh.

83
00:04:03,926 --> 00:04:06,594
This is where
the pretending ends.

84
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,053
Oh...

85
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:16,254
Now what?

86
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:18,523
You're coming with us
to the school fundraiser.

87
00:04:18,557 --> 00:04:20,425
Can this day get any worse?

88
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,993
The dog's got the mumps.

89
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:23,695
Dogs can't get mumps.

90
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:25,196
Well, then, explain this.

91
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,499
The only thing we know is
it'll cost $800.

92
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,533
Ooh!

93
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,568
(Western music playing)

94
00:04:37,993 --> 00:04:39,761
Willie, I love your chaps.

95
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:42,080
Me pants are ripped out!

96
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,084
I don't care
for silent auctions.

97
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:48,553
It just encourages hovering.

98
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:51,589
Oh...

99
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,224
Mm-hmm...

100
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:57,745
Oh!

101
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:02,717
You know you just pushed
it up to list price.

102
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:04,786
You know that, right?

103
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,521
Edna, I'm not one
for costumes,

104
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:08,323
but I sure do like that
feather in your hair.

105
00:05:08,357 --> 00:05:12,093
I like how you make me feel good
about the littlest things.

106
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:15,597
It's just you and me tonight,
Buttermilk.

107
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:17,282
(imitating hoofbeats)

108
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,533
Whoa.

109
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:21,503
Howdy, pardners,
I'm much obliged to y'all

110
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:23,872
for comin' out to
the ol' corral here...

111
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:24,906
Skinner!

112
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,408
People want to get home!
Speak regular.

113
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:30,378
Fine, we'll start the raffle and
skip the things no one wants,

114
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:32,347
like art projects
by your children

115
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:35,150
or a spaghetti dinner
with the Van Houtens.

116
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:37,585
So let's get right to the item
I'm sure you're waiting for:

117
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,721
the latest Mapple myPad!

118
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:41,422
(all exclaiming)

119
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:43,791
I could do my cyber-bullying
on the bus!

120
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:46,294
Remember when me gettin'
a cell phone was a big deal?

121
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:48,863
I bought you a ticket
for the myPad raffle, Dad.

122
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:51,966
Aw, that's Tooth Fairy money
down the drain, sweetie.

123
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:53,668
I never win anything.

124
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:56,571
It's always some stupid jerk
you've never heard of.

125
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:57,939
And the winner is...

126
00:05:57,973 --> 00:05:59,741
Here it comes...

127
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:00,742
Homer Simpson!

128
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:01,809
Get him!

129
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:03,645
I mean, woo-hoo!

130
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:05,180
(crowd cheering)

131
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:08,299
I just want to say I was having
the worst day of my life.

132
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,901
Three cheers for Homer,

133
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:11,436
minus the one
we gave him already.

134
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,321
(crowd cheers twice)

135
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:14,722
Okay, what else...

136
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:16,691
Free Tibet! You heard me!

137
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:18,660
Free him now!

138
00:06:18,694 --> 00:06:19,961
Thank you.

139
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:22,363
Oh, my luck has changed!

140
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:24,148
ANNOUNCER: <i>This is Homer Simpson's</i>
<i>13th raffle</i>

141
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,316
<i>and first win.</i>

142
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,352
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>his luck has changed.</i>

143
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,958
(tinny fanfare plays)

144
00:06:34,993 --> 00:06:37,261
Greetings, I am Steve Mobbs,

145
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:39,697
welcoming you
from beyond the grave.

146
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:42,750
I left a half-eaten apple
outside your store...

147
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:44,952
the greatest tribute of all.

148
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:48,589
The product you hold is like
a giant expensive smartphone

149
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:51,592
that can't call anyone--
it's that incredible.

150
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:53,394
Now press the "submit" icon,

151
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:56,130
and agree to buy
all our future products.

152
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:59,583
And we're gonna be making
a lot of stuff.

153
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:02,586
Submit. Submit.

154
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:03,754
I don't know, I...

155
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:05,756
Submit.
I don't want to.

156
00:07:05,774 --> 00:07:09,243
Or you could buy something
from Hewlett-Packard.

157
00:07:09,277 --> 00:07:10,611
I submit! I submit!

158
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:12,613
Yes.

159
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:14,048
Yes...

160
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:17,100
(humming happily)

161
00:07:17,118 --> 00:07:19,470
Ooh, that adult Etch-A-Sketch

162
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:21,288
certainly has
brightened your mood.

163
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:22,840
Oh, yeah!

164
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:24,391
You can look at it this way...

165
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:25,626
or this way...

166
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,794
whether you want to or not...

167
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:30,397
and it's got awesome games
like "Tapped Out."

168
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:31,665
Oh...

169
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,934
"Virtual Stapler!"

170
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:36,236
Sounds just like a stapler,
and it never runs out...

171
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:37,638
unless you tell it to.

172
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:40,991
Here's one that gives you
a cool '70s moustache.

173
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:42,393
I'm Sonny Bono.

174
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:44,028
Watch out for that tree!

175
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:45,596
(giggles)

176
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,031
So, which do you
prefer, m'lady?

177
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:50,668
Tom Selleck, Rollie Fingers,
or Pringles Man?

178
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:54,905
I always thought the Pringles
Man had the kindest eyes.

179
00:07:58,143 --> 00:08:00,844
Are you doing an app
behind my back?

180
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,280
Submit... Submit... Sub...

181
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:07,451
There ya go, Homer.

182
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:08,986
Boy, you know,
when you're just here alone,

183
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,521
I can really smell ya.

184
00:08:10,555 --> 00:08:11,722
But I'm not alone.

185
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:13,574
I'm doing some FaceTime
with Lenny.

186
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:15,509
It's like I'm skydiving
with all my friends!

187
00:08:15,543 --> 00:08:16,694
Let me text Carl.

188
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:19,046
So, uh, what are you
pullin' the ripcord with?

189
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,214
Uh-oh.

190
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:21,815
Maybe there's a ripcord app
I can use.

191
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,552
(Homer hums happily)

192
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:29,023
MARGE:
Homer, pay attention!

193
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:31,075
Huh? What?

194
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:32,626
Put that down!

195
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:34,011
We're being audited.

196
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:36,530
The old stupid moustache'll
win him over.

197
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:38,332
I'm really stupid.

198
00:08:38,366 --> 00:08:41,018
Is that the myPad you're
claiming as a business expense?

199
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:42,503
I'm standing by that.

200
00:08:42,537 --> 00:08:43,537
(groans)

201
00:08:45,907 --> 00:08:46,957
Simpson!

202
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:52,613
Unhand your Edison slate

203
00:08:52,647 --> 00:08:55,816
and bring your gold-brickery
to a caesura!

204
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,653
Put down your myPad
and get back to work.

205
00:08:59,688 --> 00:09:00,921
Sorry, boss.

206
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:03,257
Your remonstrances
are a welcome boon

207
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,392
and surely will redouble
my diligence.

208
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:07,594
Excellent!
Awesome!

209
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:09,096
Woo hoo!
Pip-pip!

210
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,197
Hmm...

211
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:13,517
Hey, Dad!
Dad, check this out!

212
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:16,220
Dad, over here!
Dad, a mother giraffe is giving birth!

213
00:09:16,254 --> 00:09:18,372
Dad, look, I'm walking on
the wall around the lion pit.

214
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:20,708
Dad, the baby giraffe is
taking its first steps.

215
00:09:20,742 --> 00:09:22,009
Dad, I'm walking on my hands,

216
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:23,243
and the lions think
they're gonna eat me!

217
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:24,511
Will you kids pipe down?

218
00:09:24,546 --> 00:09:26,380
I'm trying to get
"Churro-Chaser" to tell me

219
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:28,015
where the freshest churros are.

220
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:29,683
What country is Mexico in?

221
00:09:29,718 --> 00:09:32,853
Dad, pay attention
to your children.

222
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:34,521
Ugh, okay.

223
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:36,690
Aww.

224
00:09:36,725 --> 00:09:38,192
That'll be my screensaver.

225
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:43,464
(yells)
Just my arm.

226
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:44,648
(yells)
(chuckles)

227
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:45,649
Gotcha!

228
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:47,701
Why, you little...
(screams)

229
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:49,887
(screaming)

230
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:53,290
(Tchaikovsky's <i>Pathétique</i> plays)

231
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:59,396
Homie, you want to read to
Maggie before she goes to sleep?

232
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:01,799
(scoffs)

233
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,033
A paper-based read-a-majig?

234
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:04,768
What are we, cavemen?

235
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:05,886
(imitates caveman grunting)

236
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,977
Sweetie, in the future
all you'll need is this.

237
00:10:14,012 --> 00:10:15,512
Homie... it looks
like you're putting

238
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:17,648
all your eggs in one basket.

239
00:10:17,682 --> 00:10:18,882
What would you have me do?

240
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:20,217
One basket for each egg?

241
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:21,835
Hmm, I guess you're right.

242
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:23,771
I guess I'll have
to scratch that off

243
00:10:23,805 --> 00:10:25,205
the list of things I say.

244
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,558
Now, Maggie, let's find
a good game for us.

245
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:30,160
Hmm, "Krusty's Kosher
Karnival..."

246
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:31,762
"Words with Enemies..."

247
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:33,063
"Don't Burn the Toast,"

248
00:10:33,098 --> 00:10:34,465
"Lenny Dykstra's
Prison Break..."

249
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:36,133
ooh, "Pizza Clock!"

250
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,669
Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.

251
00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:40,270
Dough, sauce,
cheese, topping.

252
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:41,839
Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.

253
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:43,373
Having fun, Maggie?

254
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:45,459
How long have I been playing?

255
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:47,928
Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.

256
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:49,797
So that's how
you make a pizza?

257
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:51,832
Ooh, we really have
been off-a the mark.

258
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:54,318
Mmm...

259
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:57,121
(raspy): Dough, sauce,
cheese, topping.

260
00:10:57,155 --> 00:11:00,874
Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.

261
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:02,442
D'oh!

262
00:11:02,477 --> 00:11:03,994
(thud)
Sauce, cheese, topping.

263
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:05,496
(groans)

264
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,782
Flushy, go get help.

265
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:14,916
Homer, you're gonna be fine, but
there's no hope for the myPad.

266
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:19,321
(sobbing):
It still had 88% of its charge.

267
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:21,356
This is the part
of the job I hate most.

268
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,758
Talking to crazy people.

269
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:25,260
(laughs)

270
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:27,262
(groans)

271
00:11:27,296 --> 00:11:29,381
(grunting)

272
00:11:29,415 --> 00:11:30,849
Which of you is the YouTube

273
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:33,051
of the kid high
on dentist's gas?

274
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:34,486
Is it you?

275
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,155
Is it... you?
Is it you?

276
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:40,175
(moaning)

277
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:43,311
Oh, Lord, when things looked
darkest, you gave me light,

278
00:11:43,346 --> 00:11:45,213
then you switched it off,
knowing full well

279
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:47,782
I had declined
thy infernal Mapple Care.

280
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:50,318
Please grant me the wisdom
to understand

281
00:11:50,353 --> 00:11:52,537
your capricious nasty mind.

282
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:56,291
And please, please make the next
swing of the yo-yo an up.

283
00:11:56,325 --> 00:11:57,459
Amen.

284
00:11:57,493 --> 00:11:58,994
ALL:
Amen.

285
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,817
(sighs)

286
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,218
Everybody hear that?

287
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:08,720
Homer, Homer,
it's a miracle.

288
00:12:08,754 --> 00:12:11,089
Keep your pants on,
Flanders.

289
00:12:11,123 --> 00:12:12,407
(laughs):
Oh, I will.

290
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,175
Till I go to bed and take
them off under the covers.

291
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,077
But come outside
and see the miracle.

292
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:17,679
Has the myPad risen?

293
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:19,514
No, it's still
where you buried it.

294
00:12:19,548 --> 00:12:21,733
(Flanders humming)

295
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:24,369
Here it is, the Holy Ooze.

296
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:26,404
This is your miracle--
a tree?

297
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:30,342
Ooh, look at me, I turn sunlight
into complex sugars.

298
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:31,610
Big whoop.

299
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:32,844
Look a little closer.

300
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,713
Huh? "Hope."

301
00:12:34,747 --> 00:12:36,548
Is this one
of those coincidences

302
00:12:36,582 --> 00:12:37,682
like Jesus on a tortilla,

303
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:40,101
or George Washington
on a dollar bill?

304
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:43,755
Well, I like that its message
is in sap and not in blood.

305
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:45,590
Like some miracles
I could mention.

306
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,025
(clears throat):
Passover.

307
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:50,562
Well, this is how God would send
me a message: in my backyard,

308
00:12:50,596 --> 00:12:53,565
hammock-adjacent,
one short word in large print.

309
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:55,934
What do you think he's trying
to tell me, Flanders?

310
00:12:55,968 --> 00:12:57,535
Well, sir, if you ask me,

311
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,936
somebody up there
is trying to tell you

312
00:12:58,954 --> 00:13:01,623
that whatever flat tires
you've got in your life,

313
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,742
God's there
with his little spare

314
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:05,543
and it enables you
to drive real slow

315
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:06,944
till you get
to the next station.

316
00:13:06,962 --> 00:13:08,963
Don't eat the miracle.

317
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:11,516
Fine, I'll just go eat
the body of God.

318
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,551
<i>That's</i> not crazy.

319
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:18,006
Ah, looks like you're really

320
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,442
turning something over
in your mind there, Homer.

321
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:22,844
Moe, I could believe
this was a random occurrence

322
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:25,096
or I could believe some
higher power reached down

323
00:13:25,131 --> 00:13:27,699
and squeezed the sap
out of that tree.

324
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:29,434
I'm choosing hope.

325
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:31,736
Moe, a bottle
of your finest beer.

326
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:32,721
Here you go.

327
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:33,855
Duff Adequate.

328
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:35,907
To hope!

329
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,610
Wow, no one's ever been happy
in this place before.

330
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:42,013
And when I started it was Moe's
Ice Cream Carnival-- not good.

331
00:13:42,048 --> 00:13:43,748
(organ playing)

332
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:46,351
Of all the gifts
the Lord gives us,

333
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:49,421
perhaps the greatest is hope.

334
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:53,058
Uh, excuse me, Reverend,
but I'm here to talk

335
00:13:53,092 --> 00:13:56,795
about something a little
more important: hope.

336
00:13:56,829 --> 00:13:58,196
But I was just... (sighs)

337
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,266
Oh, fine-- I can get an early
start on mountain biking.

338
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,318
Hope is here, people,
and it's real.

339
00:14:03,352 --> 00:14:06,104
It's not just
inside the house of God,

340
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:09,607
it's outside the house of me.

341
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:12,043
So come and see
the sticky brown truth.

342
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:14,612
(all cheering)

343
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:16,848
♪ Ooh-ooh, child

344
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:20,068
♪ Things are gonna be easier

345
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:24,622
Hope is all around me!
♪ Ooh, child, things'll be brighter ♪

346
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:27,892
(grunting)
♪ Ooh-ooh, child...

347
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:31,346
Hmm. As promised, the miracle.

348
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,001
Really? "Other"?

349
00:14:37,036 --> 00:14:38,937
Cletus, what does
that tree say?

350
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:40,422
Now, now,
let's spell it out

351
00:14:40,456 --> 00:14:43,224
like that social worker
taught us to do.

352
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:46,060
Huckleberry, Overbite,
Picklefoot,

353
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:47,328
Edumacation.

354
00:14:47,363 --> 00:14:49,230
Oh, it says hope!

355
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:52,901
Just like in <i>Hope Floats,</i> that
Sandra Bullock movie I wrote.

356
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:58,056
This is newsman Kent Brockman,

357
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,059
vowing I will debunk
this so-called miracle.

358
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:03,862
The idiotic things
people believe in.

359
00:15:03,896 --> 00:15:05,964
Now, stay tuned
for your lucky lotto numbers.

360
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:08,600
It's your turn for sure.

361
00:15:10,865 --> 00:15:12,866
(crowd clamoring)

362
00:15:14,902 --> 00:15:17,737
A hundred dollar bill
for anyone who will give me

363
00:15:17,772 --> 00:15:21,074
the truth behind this
so-called miracle tree.

364
00:15:21,108 --> 00:15:24,210
I'll take your money.
The tree's a fraud.

365
00:15:24,245 --> 00:15:27,313
I just got a hundred.
The tree is real!

366
00:15:27,348 --> 00:15:29,015
What you got
against hope anyway?

367
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,452
I bet something
disillusioned you as a child.

368
00:15:32,486 --> 00:15:33,820
(gasps)

369
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:40,860
This is junior reporter
Kenny Bockelstein,

370
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:43,830
investigating the stories
that kids want to know.

371
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:45,231
(locker opens)

372
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,334
Mr. Mouse, how come
you haven't been

373
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:51,371
in any funny cartoons
since 1933?

374
00:15:54,842 --> 00:15:56,893
I'm on a break, kid,
and when I'm on a break,

375
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,894
the mouse is dead.

376
00:15:59,747 --> 00:16:01,981
The mouse was a man.
His teeth were yellow.

377
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:03,216
His breath was rancid.

378
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,385
My innocence was lost
in a plywood castle.

379
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:07,320
The castle is plywood?!

380
00:16:07,354 --> 00:16:09,556
(groans)

381
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,990
TV ANNOUNCER:
<i>Bumblebee Man is moving</i>

382
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:12,892
to Channel 6.

383
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:14,060
<i>Adios, ocho.</i>

384
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:15,662
You no pay.

385
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:17,597
Uh-oh, he's got
his own chimp.

386
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:18,865
(chimp yelling)

387
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,066
Senor Chango!

388
00:16:20,101 --> 00:16:21,918
Teeny's a girl?

389
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:24,237
Oh, wait, he's just a bottom.

390
00:16:25,206 --> 00:16:26,706
This is Kent Brockman
at the site

391
00:16:26,741 --> 00:16:29,008
of the so-called
"Springfield Miracle."

392
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:31,411
The question is...

393
00:16:31,445 --> 00:16:33,012
Is the hope tree a miracle?

394
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:34,514
Most decidedly not.

395
00:16:34,548 --> 00:16:36,099
<i>Flying the Channel 6</i>
<i>traffic copter</i>

396
00:16:36,117 --> 00:16:38,267
<i>without official clearance</i>
<i>and below legal levels,</i>

397
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:39,769
<i>we obtained</i>
<i>the following footage.</i>

398
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:42,956
<i>As you can see here,</i>
<i>a shadowy figure emerges</i>

399
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,808
<i>from the darkness,</i>
<i>walks up to the tree</i>

400
00:16:44,842 --> 00:16:46,342
<i>in the Simpsons' backyard,</i>

401
00:16:46,377 --> 00:16:48,411
<i>and if we freeze</i>
<i>and zoom in on the image,</i>

402
00:16:48,445 --> 00:16:51,514
We clearly see the figure
holding a syrup bottle

403
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:53,833
with which he writes
the word "hope."

404
00:16:55,636 --> 00:16:57,570
Supermarket maple syrup.

405
00:16:57,605 --> 00:16:59,506
It was no miraculous tree of God

406
00:16:59,557 --> 00:17:02,125
and there is no hope
on Evergreen Terrace.

407
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,562
Just a run-of-the-mill,
syrup-spraying mystery man.

408
00:17:05,596 --> 00:17:08,298
We can add this
to the list of...

409
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:11,634
Kent's Closed Cases.

410
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:14,003
Would you please
get the segment straight?

411
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:15,538
Just lose the graphic.

412
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:16,639
(groans)

413
00:17:16,674 --> 00:17:17,907
(groaning)

414
00:17:17,942 --> 00:17:19,175
It was all a hoax.

415
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,644
Let's burn our hats!

416
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,947
ALL (chanting):
Hope is dead! Burn the lies!

417
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:25,949
Thank God there's no alcohol
in this bar,

418
00:17:25,983 --> 00:17:27,517
or this place
would really go up.

419
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,252
(groans)

420
00:17:29,286 --> 00:17:31,121
(groaning)
Homie?

421
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:32,839
Aren't you going
to come in?

422
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:34,707
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

423
00:17:34,742 --> 00:17:36,776
Maybe it's time to call Satan.

424
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:37,944
Is that a 212?

425
00:17:37,978 --> 00:17:39,579
Don't call Satan.

426
00:17:39,613 --> 00:17:42,749
So what if the message
wasn't the miracle.

427
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:47,287
The answer isn't in syrup
from God or a computer tablet.

428
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:51,024
The answer is that you hope
you felt was real.

429
00:17:51,058 --> 00:17:52,358
Marge, up till now,

430
00:17:52,393 --> 00:17:54,861
I thought your hair
was just blue cotton candy,

431
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:58,665
but now I know
it's a solid loaf of brain.

432
00:17:58,699 --> 00:18:01,601
Homie, you have such
a way with foods.

433
00:18:01,635 --> 00:18:03,436
Let's go inside.

434
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,672
Who do you think painted
the word on the tree?

435
00:18:05,706 --> 00:18:09,175
No idea-- the important
thing is that they did.

436
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,510
Guess it must've
been the person

437
00:18:10,544 --> 00:18:12,846
