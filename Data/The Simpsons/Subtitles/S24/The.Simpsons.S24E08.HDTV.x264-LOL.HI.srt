00:00:06,037 --> 00:00:08,224
Welcome to the Montgomery
Burns Prize,

5
00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:12,449
rewarding excellence,
in the field of alternative energy.

6
00:00:12,474 --> 00:00:15,729
Local inventors are vying for a
million dollar stipend donated

7
00:00:15,754 --> 00:00:18,433
by T. Mongomery Burns, as part
of a court settlement

8
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,418
for causing one billion dollars
of environmental damage.

9
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:24,237
Shoo. Go have one
of your enormous litters.

10
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:26,723
(growls, screeches)

11
00:00:26,757 --> 00:00:28,691
First inventor,
you, bus driver.

12
00:00:28,726 --> 00:00:30,393
Give us the gist
of your terrible idea.

13
00:00:30,427 --> 00:00:33,263
Well, I've harnessed the
ancient power of slavery

14
00:00:33,297 --> 00:00:36,182
to run the school bus
of tomorrow.

15
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:40,587
(groans, sighs)

16
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:42,322
Whose boy is this?

17
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:43,823
I'll take him home.

18
00:00:43,857 --> 00:00:45,625
You'll take his place.

19
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:47,227
(groans)

20
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:48,695
I would like to present

21
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:50,964
my Kwik-E-Smart perpetual
energy machine.

22
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:53,466
Three years ago,
I tripped over the cord,

23
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,985
but the hotdogs,
they kept rolling.

24
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,738
Some say they're powered
by decaying nitrates,

25
00:00:58,772 --> 00:01:02,141
others by tiny insects
beneath the hot dog skins.

26
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:03,626
(wry laugh)

27
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:05,662
Hard to believe I once turned
down a job in Tampa, Florida,

28
00:01:05,696 --> 00:01:07,413
because I believed in this city.

29
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:08,798
That was 15 years ago.

30
00:01:08,832 --> 00:01:09,983
They wouldn't take you now.

31
00:01:10,017 --> 00:01:11,985
Is anyone here
an actual scientist?

32
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:13,436
Uh, yes, I have, on occasion,

33
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,172
dabbled in the scientific arts.

34
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:18,958
Frink Labs,
a division of Allied Frink,

35
00:01:18,993 --> 00:01:20,326
the Good-Glavin people,

36
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:24,380
are proud to present
the Frinkasonic MHV.

37
00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:27,166
And what, pray tell,
is MHV?

38
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:30,453
Oh, yes,
it's the Moyvin-Hoyvin Vehicle.

39
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:32,522
This non-magnetic babe magnet

40
00:01:32,556 --> 00:01:35,091
is powered entirely by,
you guessed it,

41
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,526
(quietly):
sound waves.

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,360
(crowd murmuring)

43
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:39,295
(engine starts)

44
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:42,398
Ah, yes, you see?

45
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,066
Your quite appropriate
oohs and ahs

46
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:46,736
are propelling me forward.
It's wonderful.

47
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,421
(gasping, murmuring excitedly)

48
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:51,824
That's slightly more enthusiasm
than I had anticipated.

49
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,693
For the love of God,

50
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:56,012
step on the brakes!

51
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:57,830
The brakes are powered
by silence.

52
00:01:57,865 --> 00:01:59,816
(people yelling)

53
00:02:00,884 --> 00:02:02,118
(Willie yelling)

54
00:02:02,152 --> 00:02:04,804
Look out because of the zooming.

55
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:09,392
Why is it ejecting?

56
00:02:09,426 --> 00:02:11,377
It's just a normal seat...!

57
00:02:14,315 --> 00:02:16,265
(gasping, shouting)

58
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:19,135
(all screaming)
No! No!

59
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:20,636
I'm okay.

60
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:22,839
I'll just go live with my son.

61
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:24,707
(screaming)
No! No!

62
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:27,310
Hurry up.

63
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:29,379
I want to get Grampa
back here by 3:00,

64
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:32,382
so we can get him and Maggie
on the same nap schedule.

65
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,583
I've labeled all his boxes.

66
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:35,018
(laughs)

67
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:36,786
Well, I can't pick up
something this heavy

68
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,121
without my lifting belt.

69
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:40,056
(sudden shout)
Ow!

70
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,891
You know you can't
lift your lifting belt

71
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:44,527
without wearing your
belt-lifting-belt.

72
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:45,728
Oh, no.

73
00:02:45,763 --> 00:02:48,131
I won't be able
to help you pack up Grampa.

74
00:02:48,165 --> 00:02:49,215
Fine.

75
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:51,684
Just stay here and
hold down the fort.

76
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,052
Hold down the fort?

77
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:54,687
With my bad back?

78
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:56,723
(groans)

79
00:02:59,193 --> 00:03:00,326
(chuckles)

80
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:03,329
Man, that keyboard-playing cat
is so cute.

81
00:03:03,364 --> 00:03:06,165
(playing jazzy tune
over tablet speaker)

82
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,734
"Villageville"?!

83
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:11,170
"Build your own authentic
medieval village."

84
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:13,272
I must have
something better to do.

85
00:03:15,726 --> 00:03:17,076
And ca-lick.

86
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:19,362
(fanfare plays)

87
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:21,864
Finally, a woodcutter that will
do what I tell him.

88
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:23,933
(humming happily)

89
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:25,268
Holy moley!

90
00:03:25,302 --> 00:03:27,737
He's already made a clearing.

91
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:29,539
Let's go for a glade.

92
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:33,926
(chopping and bell dinging
repeatedly)

93
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:35,261
(chuckles)

94
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:36,796
Just call me DeForest Kelley.

95
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,765
I gotta write that down
and send it to Conan.

96
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,467
Oh, move this here-- tap.

97
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:44,437
Mill, mill.

98
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:45,838
Barn, silo.

99
00:03:45,873 --> 00:03:48,007
Tavern, tavern, tavern, tavern,
tavern, tavern...

100
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,542
Brothel.

101
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:50,843
Parsonage.

102
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:52,295
A Theater in the Round.

103
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:54,564
And...

104
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:56,249
hay pile.

105
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,867
(panting)

106
00:03:57,885 --> 00:03:59,035
"And the Lord saw

107
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:00,770
"what He had made,

108
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:02,738
and it was good."

109
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:04,273
(groans)

110
00:04:04,308 --> 00:04:05,675
VILLAGERS (over speaker):
Ew.

111
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:07,076
Yeah, that's right,

112
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:09,579
your Lord sticks his hand
in his pants.

113
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:13,516
And yes, it is the same hand
I tapped you with.

114
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,151
(bell dings)

115
00:04:20,023 --> 00:04:21,457
Well, if I've learned anything,

116
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:24,827
it's that you can't have
too much iron ore.

117
00:04:24,862 --> 00:04:27,763
Maybe one of your tavern wenches
can do the laundry.

118
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:30,316
(shrieks)
You're back.

119
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,784
Did you spend this whole time

120
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:34,153
doing fake chores
in a fake village?

121
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:37,490
It's real to them.
(groans)

122
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:39,592
Um, where's
Santa's Little Helper?

123
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:40,993
I don't know.
The backyard?

124
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:42,962
The backyard?
But what if he got out

125
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:45,998
through your half-completed
tunnel to Flanders's fridge?

126
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:48,801
I don't see him anywhere.

127
00:04:48,836 --> 00:04:51,003
You jackass.
You lost our dog!

128
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:52,688
Oh, my God.

129
00:04:52,723 --> 00:04:55,458
I forgot to feed my jackass.

130
00:04:57,194 --> 00:04:59,162
(bellowing):
Hank-hew.

131
00:04:59,196 --> 00:05:00,863
(bellowing):
You're welcome.

132
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:05,636
Santa's Little Helper.

133
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:09,707
Santa's Little Helper!

134
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:10,975
I love that dog,

135
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:13,477
but that is one long,
stupid name.

136
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:18,632
(both groaning)

137
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:21,268
(meows)

138
00:05:23,338 --> 00:05:24,872
What the hell?

139
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:26,173
Oh, right.

140
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:30,694
The animal shelter hasn't had
any greyhounds turned in.

141
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:34,648
Just a dachshund, a chow,
and a pregnant raccoon.

142
00:05:34,683 --> 00:05:37,017
A lot of good backups.
How pregnant is the raccoon?

143
00:05:37,052 --> 00:05:38,485
We don't want a raccoon.

144
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,570
Good, Marge.

145
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:40,821
Get their price down.

146
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:43,123
Dad, I just
noticed something.

147
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:45,192
You're not upset enough
about this.

148
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:47,127
Hey, Lisa's right.

149
00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:50,297
You're the only one who
hasn't cried about the dog.

150
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:51,298
Not a crier.

151
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,234
What? You cry all the time.

152
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:56,470
You cried when they canceled
that show you hated.

153
00:05:56,504 --> 00:05:58,472
Goofing on it made me feel wise.

154
00:05:58,506 --> 00:05:59,974
(whimpering)

155
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:02,893
Where is that coming from?
From the kitchen.

156
00:06:03,628 --> 00:06:06,030
(gasps) He's alive!

157
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:08,065
And he didn't pee on the floor.

158
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:10,334
For me,
that's a perfect day.

159
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:12,970
(everyone talking at once)

160
00:06:13,004 --> 00:06:15,873
Dad, why'd you shut our dog
in a cabinet?

161
00:06:15,907 --> 00:06:16,974
I'll answer that.

162
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:18,809
Your father's an idiot.

163
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:21,412
I believe the word is <i>idiote.</i>

164
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:23,814
How did Santa's Little Helper
get in there?

165
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:26,750
(gasps)
I know what must have happened.

166
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,987
I'm going to get a snack,

167
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:33,190
but first, should I introduce
the black plague?

168
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:34,892
Mm... what could be the harm?

169
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:36,060
(man screaming over speaker)

170
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:38,362
Whoa, now I've got to buy
a corpse wagon.

171
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:39,730
Well, that's how they get you.

172
00:06:41,549 --> 00:06:43,984
Hmm... ooh, it's amazing

173
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:47,688
how many things they can
make taste like cheese.

174
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:50,724
Oh, yeah, baby, I'm drinking
you down to your knees.

175
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,842
(sniffing)

176
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:53,344
♪ Gonna drink ammonia

177
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:54,928
♪ 'Cause it tastes like cheese

178
00:06:54,963 --> 00:06:57,364
♪ I wonder what will happen...

179
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:01,969
A minstrel has composed
a roundelay mocking me?

00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:03,170
Torture, torture, torture.

181
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:04,355
(people screaming over speaker)

182
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:07,925
Well, it's time we showed
this dog some love.

183
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,759
Oh.
Oh.

184
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:09,777
(all speak soothingly)

185
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:11,578
Attaboy.

186
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:13,747
Hey Homer, how come
you're not hugging the dog?

187
00:07:13,782 --> 00:07:15,916
He knows I love him,
and he loves me.

188
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,451
(growling)

189
00:07:17,485 --> 00:07:19,987
That's short for
"Rrright you are."

190
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:22,890
I don't think you even like
Santa's Little Helper.

191
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:26,293
You never take him for walks
or sleep with him in your arms.

192
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:29,730
And I suspect you've been
chewing on his treats.

193
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:32,700
How are they his treats
if I paid for them?

194
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:33,934
Okay, okay.

195
00:07:33,968 --> 00:07:35,202
I'll be nicer to the dude.

196
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:37,304
I've just never really
been a dog person.

197
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:38,939
Really? What about Bongo?

198
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:40,691
Bongo?!

199
00:07:40,725 --> 00:07:43,277
I told you never
to ever talk about Bongo.

200
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:46,096
(sobbing)

201
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:49,066
Ever!

202
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,068
What just happened?
Who's Bongo?

203
00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:54,171
Bongo was Homer's dog
when he was a boy.

204
00:07:54,205 --> 00:07:55,806
HOMER:
He's still my dog!

205
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,075
We got him years ago.

206
00:07:58,109 --> 00:07:59,877
HOMER: I don't know what you
just said, but it's wrong!

207
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:01,145
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

208
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:04,581
(sighs)
I was working long hours

209
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:07,117
<i>at the Springfield</i>
<i>Smokestack Factory.</i>

210
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:12,072
<i>Oh, I was so tired</i>
<i>when I got home.</i>

211
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:15,625
<i>Then little Homer</i>
<i>would start crying and crying,</i>

212
00:08:15,643 --> 00:08:18,345
<i>but Bongo knew just what to do.</i>

213
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:20,397
(howling, crying stops)

214
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:22,983
(snoring)

215
00:08:23,017 --> 00:08:26,820
Now, my dear, we can
watch <i>Mannix</i> as a couple.

216
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:29,957
Unfortunately,
like all true stories,

217
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:32,793
this one has a crappy ending.

218
00:08:32,827 --> 00:08:34,845
You have a story with an ending?

219
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,514
Uh-huh. All my stories
have endings now.

220
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:40,551
They're putting something
in my Jell-O down at the home.

221
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:43,087
Anyway, Homer and that dog

222
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:46,757
went together like Christmas
and suicidal thoughts.

I had no clue.

238
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:36,106
Then came the fateful day

239
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:38,075
when Mr. Burns was lobbying

240
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:41,512

241
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:43,881

Don't thwart my ambition.

245
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:52,372
Look, they even talk.

246
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:55,275
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Cancer

247
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,376
Creepy.

248
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:57,961
You can have mine, Bongo.

249
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:00,714
Those toys are people bribes,
you good-hearted little brat.

250
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:02,566
(growling)

251
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,101
Ugh! He bit me!

252
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:05,719
(growling)
Get him out of here, son.

253
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:07,120
Now.

254
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:11,275
Mr. Burns,
I'm awfully sorry.

255
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:12,876
Oh, I'll be all right.

256
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:15,245
Once I hold your
dying pet in my arms

257
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,980
and feel his wagging
tail go stiff.

258
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:19,816
Uh, sir, you are aware you're
at a PR event for children.

259
00:10:21,052 --> 00:10:22,252
(chuckles)

260
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:24,071
Bring in the clown.

261
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:25,155
Hey-hey!

262
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,107
(laughs)

263
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:29,142
So, Lady Godiva gets a haircut,

264
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:30,477
right, and...

265
00:10:30,512 --> 00:10:31,595
Kids?

266
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:32,729
Uh, no problem.

267
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:34,331
I'll just cut

268
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:36,333
(muttering)

269
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:38,168
Farmer's daughter, no.

270
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:40,437
A man from Nantucket, no.

271
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:42,039

277
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,670
Homer had no idea.

278
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:00,939
He was so innocent and chubby.

279
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:03,308
Course now,
he's just stupid and fat.

280
00:11:03,342 --> 00:11:05,210
Focus.
Huh? Oh, right.

281
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:06,778
Little Homer didn't know it,

282
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:09,664
<i>but Burns had unleashed</i>

You were driving away.

296
00:11:41,197 --> 00:11:42,898
He wrote a memoir.
Oh.

297
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,967
Uh-oh.

298
00:11:46,002 --> 00:11:47,636
Huh.

302
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:53,442
Son, I've got an idea.

303
00:11:53,476 --> 00:11:55,544
A hole next to the seat
to hold my cup?

304
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:57,028
That's a stupid idea.

305
00:11:57,063 --> 00:11:58,914
Holding cups
are what thighs are for.

306
00:11:58,948 --> 00:12:00,365
Now hang on tight.

00:12:08,091 --> 00:12:10,058
Are you sure
the Big Brother Program

311
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:12,043
couldn't find me
anybody else?

312
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,296
Yeah, well, you were
my last pick, too, okay?

313
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:17,399

316
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:23,288
What do I do now?

317
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:25,557
Well, my dream
is to be police chief.

318
00:12:25,591 --> 00:12:27,225
Oh, no, you can't 'cause,
um, that's my dream.

319
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,420
I'm gonna be chief of police.

320
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:30,195
Well, then I'll be
a spokesman for my people,

321
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:31,630
like Ralph Abernathy.

322
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:34,916
Ralph, I like that name.

323
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:39,788
Man, this story
is filling in a lot of gaps.

324
00:12:39,822 --> 00:12:43,191
But I want to know about Dad
and his broken heart.

325
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:45,260
Your father lost a lot
in his life--

326
00:12:45,294 --> 00:12:47,095
his hair, his mother,

327
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,332
more games of Monopoly
than any man ought.

328
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:54,736
He'd go to jail and stay there
'cause he loves the easy life,

329
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,571
but I think losing that dog

330
00:12:56,606 --> 00:12:59,241
was the toughest blow of all.

331
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:01,409
HOMER:
Where are we going, Daddy?

332
00:13:01,444 --> 00:13:03,428
Remember our old
neighbor, Miss Viola?

333
00:13:03,462 --> 00:13:05,697
Well, she moved to the country,
where there was no limit

334
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:08,316
on how many pets one
single lady could own.

335
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:09,784
Miss Viola?

336
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:11,486
Isn't she cuckoo?

337
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:14,823
Now, son,
a lot of people are cuckoo

338
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:16,775
till you need something
from them.

339
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:20,078
<i>I knew that Bongo would have</i>
<i>a good home there</i>

340
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:22,280
<i>and Burns would never find him.</i>

341
00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:23,648
Gosh, Miss Viola,

342
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:25,650
I want you
and your husband to know

343
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:27,519
how much I appreciate this.

344
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:29,688
(both groan,
then goat bleats)

345
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:31,790
Well, let's get this dog in.

346
00:13:31,824 --> 00:13:33,491
(whimpers)
Come on.

347
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:37,429
Son, uh, why don't you
give him your sweatshirt

348
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:39,231
so he'll remember you.

349
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:41,249
Okay.

350
00:13:41,284 --> 00:13:44,002
How long till we come back
and get him?

351
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:46,338
<i>I had to tell my boy</i>

355
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:55,013
What? No.

356
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:56,648
No! No!

357
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,066
Bongo!

358
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,901
(wailing)

359
00:13:59,936 --> 00:14:02,153
<i>Turns out,</i>
<i>he caught on pretty quick.</i>

360
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:07,096
Your father was devastated.

361
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:08,048
(crying)

362
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:10,384
(scoffs)
Women and their crying.

363
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:12,986
(sobbing):
Finish the damn story.

364
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:16,023
I've got
a hockey game tonight.

365
00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:19,576
<i>When I finally got back</i>
<i>to the house...</i>

366
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,129
Simpson, release your hound.

367
00:14:22,163 --> 00:14:25,215
He's already gone
where you'll never get him.

368
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:27,184
I'm a powerful man, Simpson.

369
00:14:27,218 --> 00:14:29,436
I can walk into McDonalds,
order soup,

370
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,704
and they'll make it.

371
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:31,938
Go on. Get.

372
00:14:31,973 --> 00:14:35,058
I got a bug zapper,
and I ain't afraid to use it.

373
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:37,277
Is that sugar water I smell?

374
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,712
(electrical zapping)
(groans)

375
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:41,631
Well, I'm afraid I
already told my dogs

376
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,383
they could tear yours apart.

377
00:14:43,418 --> 00:14:45,869
Don't make me look into those
pitiless black eyes and say,

378
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:49,306
"Daddy didn't bring you
a friend-friend to rip-rip!"

379
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,557
Where's Bongo?

380
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:52,008
Is he still
at the crazy lady's...

381
00:14:52,043 --> 00:14:53,310
Back to sleep, son.

382
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:54,678
(chuckles)

383
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:58,548
(groans, snores)

384
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,083
Oh, listen,

385
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:02,319
I can think of something
you'd enjoy

386
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:04,054
more than killing a dog.

387
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:05,555
Dropping a horse on a church?

388
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,558
No! Breaking a man's spirit.

389
00:15:08,593 --> 00:15:09,793
Mine.

390
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:11,762
Well, I guess I could always

391
00:15:11,796 --> 00:15:14,030
drop a horse on a
church afterward.

392
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:14,865
Fine.

393
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:16,249
<i>I had to take care</i>

394
00:15:16,284 --> 00:15:18,869
<i>of his hounds for a year.</i>

395
00:15:18,903 --> 00:15:20,087
<i>I tried to wear</i>

396
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:21,588
<i>a bite-proof suit,</i>

397
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:24,658
<i>but those satanic Snoopys</i>
<i>always found their way in.</i>

398
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:26,710
(growling, groaning)

399
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:32,632
I'm not done with you.

400
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:36,803
I insist you never wear shoes
or a proper necktie again.

401
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:38,071
Just house slippers

402
00:15:38,106 --> 00:15:40,474
and the most humiliating tie
there is:

403
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:42,476
bolo.

404
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,644
(gasps)

405
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,279
<i>But the hardest part</i>

406
00:15:46,314 --> 00:15:49,583
<i>was that my son</i>
<i>was so angry with me.</i>

407
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:51,184
How was school today?

408
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:52,719
Ketchup, please.

409
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:55,355
You're probably wondering
how I got rabies.

410
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:56,923
Well...
I'm not hungry anymore.

411
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,209
<i>Our relationship</i>
<i>never recovered,</i>

412
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:02,946
<i>and no amount of ignoring</i>
<i>the problem could ever fix it.</i>

413
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,197
(sobbing)

414
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:07,367
Grampa, why is the
saddest story you ever told

415
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:09,669
the only one that's
ever made sense?

416
00:16:09,704 --> 00:16:12,005
(scoffs)
Doesn't make sense to me.

417
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:15,842
I happen to remember it
just a little differently.

418
00:16:15,877 --> 00:16:17,611
Well, tell us your version.

419
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:21,398
Now granted, I was just a kid,
but I say...

420
00:16:21,432 --> 00:16:24,151
<i>Grampa always hated Bongo</i>

421
00:16:24,185 --> 00:16:26,119
<i>and loved money</i>
<i>so he sold Bongo</i>

422
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:27,304
<i>to a wicked farm witch</i>

423
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:29,523
<i>just so he could hang out</i>

424
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:31,975
<i>with a bunch of rich dogs</i>
<i>and kidnapped Santa</i>

425
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:35,045
<i>so I'd never get the toy</i>
<i>I actually wanted.</i>

426
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,447
And then... then wha...

427
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:38,932
and then what happened... was...

428
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:41,718
(stammers)

429
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:44,321
Gee, my story
doesn't make much sense

430
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:46,056
except the Santa part.

431
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,724
Yeah, but at least it was short.

432
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,392
Wait. Wait.

433
00:16:49,427 --> 00:16:52,596
There's one part of the story
even Grampa didn't know about.

434
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:56,333
A few months later,
I went to rescue Bongo.

435
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:04,040
(coughing)

436
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:07,043
Hendrix, come here, boy.

437
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:08,979
(barking)

438
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:11,982
<i>But there was one thing</i>
<i>I wasn't prepared for.</i>

439
00:17:12,016 --> 00:17:13,300
<i>Bongo was...</i>

440
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:16,052
<i>happy without me.</i>

441
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:19,356
<i>He had become her dog.</i>

442
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,341
Oh, Homie.

443
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,009
I'm so sorry.

444
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:25,111
Well, that's just
the way dogs are.

445
00:17:25,146 --> 00:17:28,181
The most disloyal, unfaithful
creatures God ever made.

446
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:31,251
Homer, maybe you should take
a look at this.

447
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:34,955
A Christmas card I got
from Miss Viola years later.

448
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:39,609
HOMER: He still had
my sweatshirt.

449
00:17:39,644 --> 00:17:41,578
Bongo didn't forget you.

450
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:44,214
Unlike those gerbils
of yours we gave away.

451
00:17:44,248 --> 00:17:46,416
Oh, they were fickle as hell.

452
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,184
Oh, my God, Dad.

453
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:50,487
I owe you an apology.

454
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:53,523
You saved Bongo.

455
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:56,626
I never understood that
till now.

456
00:17:56,661 --> 00:17:58,295
(sobbing):
All these years I thought

457
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:01,464
you loved that dog more than me.

458
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:05,168
(sobbing):
Why would you think that?

459
00:18:05,202 --> 00:18:09,572
Just because I put you in a home
where they feed you dog food?

460
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:12,575
Aw, give me a hug, son.

461
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,478
Okay, but I'm a little
out of practice.

462
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:18,682
Hold your arms like you're
carrying a wedding cake.

463
00:18:18,716 --> 00:18:19,849
What flavor?

464
00:18:19,884 --> 00:18:21,017
It doesn't matter.

465
00:18:21,052 --> 00:18:23,403
If it doesn't matter,
then I call Snickers.

466
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:24,571
That's not a flavor.

467
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,273
Everything's a flavor

468
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:27,807
in the kitchens of today.

469
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:29,442
Just hug already.

470
00:18:33,414 --> 00:18:35,548
Homie? Huh?

471
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,285
(snoring)

472
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,170
Come on, boy,
time to go to bed.

473
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:42,055
My dog.

474
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:44,658
All right, Homer,
it's your moment.

475
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:46,126
But he's mine tomorrow.

476
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,961
(both snoring)

477
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:50,446
♪ Me and my Arrow

478
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:55,785
♪ Straighter than narrow

479
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:00,657

00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:12,769
More cheese, sir?

482
00:19:12,803 --> 00:19:14,671
No. Any word
from Karl Rove?

483
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:16,573
Sir, despite what he's been
telling you, it's over.

484
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,475
Romney lost.
Damn it.

485
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:21,644
I guess it's time I explain
to these good people

486
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,164
the upcoming fiscal cliff.

487
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:30,553
Think of the economy as a car
and the rich man as the driver.

488
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:32,672
If you don't give the
driver all the money,

489
00:19:32,707 --> 00:19:34,224
he'll drive you over a cliff.

490
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:37,227
It's just common sense.

491
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:38,995
Furthermore,
rich people feel things

492
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,830
more deeply than the common man.

493
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:44,167
(screaming, sobbing)

494
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:46,703
And we've got to change our
approach to immigration.

495
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:49,639
I have a progressive proposal
to let into this country

496
00:19:49,673 --> 00:19:52,025
200 grimy Irishmen a year.

497
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,127
I've got lots of potatoes
that need peeling

498
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:55,895
and stables to be mucked out.

499
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,547
Sir, the insta-polls are in.

500
00:19:57,581 --> 00:19:59,349
You're just digging
yourself deeper.

501
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:00,817
Well, then let me
just say this.

502
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:03,553
Marco Rubio...
(speaking Spanish)

503
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:05,488
I'm afraid you
just made things even worse.

504
00:20:05,523 --> 00:20:06,790
How? Why?

505
00:20:06,824 --> 00:20:09,092
You just said Marco Rubio
is a pink handkerchief.

506
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:10,877
This public service announcement
is over.

507
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,240
BURNS:
<i>Execute the cameraman.</i>

508
00:20:55,648 --> 00:20:56,720
Shh!
