Pushy sign!
Don't tell me what to try!

21
00:00:58,363 --> 00:01:01,799
Homer! Dr. Hibbert told you
to eat healthier!

22
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,067
I don't recall that.

23
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:04,618
Well, I do.

24
00:01:04,652 --> 00:01:05,636
Eat healthier!

25
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,055
You too, Julius!

26
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:09,656
I heard you were
at Loretta's Diner

27
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:10,624
on "Catfish Friday"!

28
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:12,159
How do you know that?

29
00:01:12,193 --> 00:01:13,494
You got your brother
following me?

30
00:01:13,528 --> 00:01:14,795
Chester needs a job.

31
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:16,480
I paid him to build a shed!

32
00:01:16,514 --> 00:01:18,982
Where is my shed,
Bernice?

33
00:01:19,017 --> 00:01:20,734
(hushed):
One onion rings, please.

34
00:01:23,204 --> 00:01:24,972
Can I borrow ten bucks
from the cash register?

35
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:27,007
I've gotta get drunk
before a party.

36
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:28,242
(stressed-out murmuring)

37
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:31,011
Excuse me.
A homeless man is

38
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:32,479
giving himself
a sink bath!

39
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:33,497
(stressed-out murmuring)

40
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:35,499
(kids yelling)

41
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:38,318
Karate class is here and hungry!

42
00:01:38,353 --> 00:01:40,921
You got any scented candles?

43
00:01:40,955 --> 00:01:42,656
(fryer beeping)

44
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:46,059
(Homer screams)

45
00:01:46,094 --> 00:01:49,430
Ow! This is the worst pain
imaginable!

46
00:01:49,464 --> 00:01:51,231
This one's cold.

47
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:55,803
Mr. Simpson, your injury was
no accidénte,

48
00:01:55,837 --> 00:01:58,272
it was... negligénce.

49
00:01:58,306 --> 00:02:00,107
My burns have affected our...

50
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:01,558
(whispers):
intimacy...

51
00:02:01,593 --> 00:02:03,977
because all night,
I talk about how much money

52
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:05,913
I'm going to make
from the lawsuit.

53
00:02:05,947 --> 00:02:08,732
Money? What I am concerned
about is your burns.

54
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:10,300
(grunts skeptically)

55
00:02:10,335 --> 00:02:12,169
They have healed
much too quickly.

56
00:02:12,203 --> 00:02:16,940
Sit still while I give
your head the "third degree."

57
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:20,577
(screams) Oh, God!
It hurts worse than the burns!

58
00:02:20,612 --> 00:02:23,514
Yes, these are
special acid markers.

59
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:28,902
Homer Simpson, you shall receive
$5,000 after legal fees.

60
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:30,270
Pay up, Krusty.

61
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:32,039
It wasn't even my place!

62
00:02:32,073 --> 00:02:34,775
Man, I got a bad lawyer.

63
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,745
So, uh, what are you gonna do
with the money, Homer?

64
00:02:38,797 --> 00:02:40,631
Well, thought bubble
Marge said we should

65
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:42,549
put it in a college
fund for Lisa.

66
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:43,934
So where's
the money now?

67
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:45,652
I put it in the bank.

68
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:49,139
That place is great!
On their wall, they had a photo

69
00:02:49,174 --> 00:02:51,608
with an old couple walking on
the beach

70
00:02:51,643 --> 00:02:53,143
with their pants rolled up.

71
00:02:53,178 --> 00:02:55,078
Uh, Homer, we all
wanna walk on a beach

72
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:56,513
with our pants rolled up,

73
00:02:56,547 --> 00:02:59,149
but, uh, banks are not as safe
as they used to be.

74
00:02:59,184 --> 00:03:00,834
Yeah, when you give
the bank your money,

75
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:02,419
they lend it
to other people!

76
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:04,438
I saw a <i>Sesame Street</i>
about it!

77
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:06,673
Kermit was wearing his
trench coat and everything.

78
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,159
Wait, the frog in the trench
coat is Kermit, too?

79
00:03:09,194 --> 00:03:10,978
All the frogs on
that show are Kermit.

80
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:13,197
Keeps all the other frog
actors out of work.

81
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:14,832
That settles it.
No banks for me.

82
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:17,034
I'll tell you where
you should put your money.

83
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:19,303
The one safe place left in this
world of woe:

84
00:03:19,337 --> 00:03:20,704
What the...?

85
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:23,707
I'm not gonna gamble
with my daughter's future.

86
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:25,509
Nah, you don't have
to bet the money.

87
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:28,145
The poker website just keeps it
nice and safe,

88
00:03:28,179 --> 00:03:30,681
where the FDIC can't get its
grubby little hands on it!

89
00:03:30,715 --> 00:03:34,218
A poker site is now safer
than an American bank.

90
00:03:34,252 --> 00:03:37,988
Has our nation-- built on people
suing because their onion rings

91
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:40,607
were too hot-- come to this?

92
00:03:40,642 --> 00:03:42,776
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't you badmouth this country.

93
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,012
Compared to the rest
of the Third World,

94
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:45,913
we're doin' great!

95
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:47,714
Open file, click and...

96
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:50,200
(cash register dings)

97
00:03:50,235 --> 00:03:51,301
...invested!

98
00:03:51,336 --> 00:03:53,203
Hey, Lisa, check out
your college fund!

99
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:56,139
You put my college fund
on a poker site?!

100
00:03:56,174 --> 00:03:57,808
It's a classy operation.

101
00:03:57,842 --> 00:04:00,177
See? The little dealer's
wearing a bow tie-- cute!

102
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:02,846
Well...at least I have
a college fund!

103
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:04,047
On a poker site!

104
00:04:04,082 --> 00:04:05,849
More importantly,
it's a college fund.

105
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:06,917
On a poker site!

106
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:08,318
Dad, please!

107
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:10,120
Sorry. Check out
my new T-shirt.

108
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,391
(sighs) Where did you get
that shirt?

109
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:16,026
I've had it
for a long time.

110
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,061
I was just about
to throw it out,

111
00:04:18,096 --> 00:04:19,179
and then this happened.

112
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:21,765
Mwah!

113
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,767
(rattling)

114
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:26,270
That's one way
to avoid drunk driving.

115
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:27,938
Another way is
don't drink.

116
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:29,673
I'm not Superman.

117
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:31,975
Homie, do you know
what yesterday was?

118
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,144
Ha! Of course I do!

119
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:37,514
Happy anni...
birth... entine...

120
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:39,316
Shark week?

121
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,220
Yesterday's the day we were
supposed to visit Grampa!

122
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:46,356
What the...?!
Stupid calendar.

123
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:49,192
First you put the Fourth of July
on Sunday, and now this!

124
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:52,312
Oh, we're gonna discuss this
later!

125
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,050
Okay, remember the plan:
Apologize to Grampa.

126
00:04:57,085 --> 00:05:00,120
Then when he wants us
to take him out to lunch,

127
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:01,772
point to the leftovers,

128
00:05:01,806 --> 00:05:03,824
tell him we already did,
but he forgot.

129
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:05,408
I still feel guilty.

130
00:05:05,426 --> 00:05:08,011
Your father's not going
to be around forever.

131
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:09,780
Marge, you take that back!

132
00:05:09,814 --> 00:05:11,748
Fine, he'll be
around forever.

133
00:05:11,783 --> 00:05:13,116
You take <i>that</i> back!

134
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:14,151
(sighs)

135
00:05:15,186 --> 00:05:16,253
(sighs)

136
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:18,622
We're here to see Abe Simpson.

137
00:05:18,656 --> 00:05:20,123
Abe Simpson?!
Uh, excuse me.

138
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:23,010
(curious grunting)

139
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:25,679
I'm very sorry
to tell you your father...

140
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:27,447
is missing.

141
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:30,417
Missing?! What kind of a prison
are you people running here?

142
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:32,085
If it's any consolation,
we'll probably find him

143
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,720
when the river thaws in
the spring.

144
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:36,556
A lot of bobbers then.

145
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,237
There's gotta be a clue
in here somewhere.

146
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:47,893
Spats, sock garters, the world's
hardest hard candy...

147
00:05:50,446 --> 00:05:51,646
Oh, it's hopeless!

148
00:05:51,681 --> 00:05:54,683
This room is like a museum
of meaningless old crap.

149
00:05:54,717 --> 00:05:57,319
By which I mean
every museum.

150
00:05:57,353 --> 00:05:59,020
Grampa's army footlocker!

151
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:01,256
I bet the most important things
in the world

152
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,191
to him are in this box!

153
00:06:03,226 --> 00:06:05,026
So precious...

154
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:11,666
Look at that,
a man's whole life

155
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:14,035
being kicked around
on the floor.

156
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,238
MARGE:
"Spiro's...

157
00:06:16,272 --> 00:06:18,673
The place that changed
my life..."

158
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,510
Flimsy lead,
take me away!

159
00:06:21,544 --> 00:06:25,280
Okay, baby,
let's see the flop.

160
00:06:25,314 --> 00:06:26,865
Damn it! Lost again.

161
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:29,451
(trilling, blipping)

162
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:30,702
(cash register rings)

163
00:06:30,753 --> 00:06:32,354
(gasps)

164
00:06:32,388 --> 00:06:35,223
Are you playing poker
with my college fund?

165
00:06:35,258 --> 00:06:37,359
I'm only down $62.

166
00:06:37,393 --> 00:06:38,960
Not counting my tips
to the waitresses.

167
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:45,634
Get your hands off
my future!

168
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:48,904
Fine, fine.

169
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:51,289
New low, even for this family.

170
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:53,024
College fund on a poker site.

171
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:54,199
I'm just gonna log right out.

172
00:06:54,224 --> 00:06:55,099
Hm.

173
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,390
Get out of here!

174
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:01,117
Huh. Two queens.

175
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:03,453
That's a great start.

176
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:07,557
Well, maybe I can just win
the $62 back.

177
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:09,459
(beeping)

178
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:14,831
Four queens! Yes! Yes...!

179
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:16,132
Gambling, eh?

180
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:18,301
Satan's most potent
recruiting tool!

181
00:07:18,335 --> 00:07:22,072
All due respect, Mr. Flanders,
could I have a little privacy?

182
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:24,808
Please?

183
00:07:24,842 --> 00:07:26,209
Thank you.

184
00:07:31,882 --> 00:07:34,250
(cash register rings,
game trills)

185
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:37,270
Yeah! $50 up! (laughs)

186
00:07:37,304 --> 00:07:40,607
Time to play with house money!

187
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:42,624
Or time to walk away
from the table.

188
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:44,649
Shoo!

189
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:46,763
How did he...?

190
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:50,383
Can't let Lisa lose her
sense of wonder. (grunts)

191
00:07:53,804 --> 00:07:56,873
(dogs growling)

192
00:07:58,342 --> 00:07:59,876
(both whimpering)

193
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,411
(patrons murmuring,
laughing)

194
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:07,834
Excuse me,
have you seen this man?

195
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:10,136
We don't like
questions, man.

196
00:08:10,171 --> 00:08:12,338
Yeah, but I'm just trying
to get information,

197
00:08:12,373 --> 00:08:15,208
like a nosey reporter
or an undercover cop.

198
00:08:15,242 --> 00:08:16,409
What'd he say
about a cop?

199
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:18,812
Or a spy from a rival gang?

200
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:19,813
Hey, what are you doing?

201
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:22,382
(screaming)

202
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,384
(Homer gibbering)

203
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:26,452
Abe Simpson...
used to work here.

204
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:27,453
Put him down!

205
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:28,488
Ow!

206
00:08:29,373 --> 00:08:32,425
(sneezes)

207
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:33,293
Welcome to Spiro's!

208
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:35,228
I am Spiro.

209
00:08:35,262 --> 00:08:37,163
Not the Spiro on the sign.
That's my brother.

210
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:39,165
Did you say my dad
worked here?

211
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,900
Yes, in the old days.

212
00:08:40,935 --> 00:08:44,571
When people ate steak, drank
champagne, and the music...

213
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:48,508
oh, the music!
I hated the music!

214
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:50,977
(swinging be-bop playing)

215
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,571
Hmm...

216
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:05,408
Simpson! I pay you
to clean tables,

217
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:07,010
not to write songs.

218
00:09:07,044 --> 00:09:08,444
And you, Marvin Hamlisch,

219
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:10,780
I pay you to write songs,
not to clean tables!

220
00:09:10,814 --> 00:09:13,116
What can I say?
I like to pitch in.

221
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,567

222
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:21,457

229
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,110
Me.

230
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:43,730
Rita Lafleur singing

231
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:47,217

you can see everything!
Disgusting!

00:10:05,502 --> 00:10:06,569
You're fired!

240
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:07,971
Hey, you can't
do that!

241
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:10,173
I just turned sweet on him!
Yeah!

Be sweet on him in

243
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:14,160
Why did I ever leave Greece?

00:10:14,194 --> 00:10:16,162
Oh, that's right,
'cause it's a train wreck.

245
00:10:17,214 --> 00:10:19,415
I never saw
either of them again.

00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,517
If you find your Dad,
tell him sorry

247
00:10:21,552 --> 00:10:24,454
from Spiro Papadapaconstanti-
kasgianopolop odopotopolis.

248
00:10:24,488 --> 00:10:25,989
Got it.

249
00:10:26,023 --> 00:10:30,326
Papadapaconstanti-kasgianopolop
odopotopolis.

250
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:31,995
Now, what was that
singer's name again?

251
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:33,263
Rita Lafleur.

252
00:10:33,297 --> 00:10:35,498
Rita La-what?

253
00:10:35,532 --> 00:10:36,499
Lafleur.

254
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:37,800
One more time.

255
00:10:37,835 --> 00:10:39,869
Ugh! I'll write it
down for you.

256
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:43,940
Thank you Mr. Papadapaconstanti-
kasgianopolop odopotopolis.

257
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:45,008
(gasps)

258
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:46,009
There's exactly
one Rita Lafleur

259
00:10:46,043 --> 00:10:48,211
living in Springfield!

260
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:49,796
That's where <i>we</i> live!

261
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,065
Hello?
Rita Lafleur?

262
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:54,801
Did you know a man
named Abe Simpson?

263
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:55,935
Know him?

264
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,203
I'm married to him.

265
00:10:57,237 --> 00:10:58,304
(gasps)

266
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:00,473
Homer, she's married
to your dad!

267
00:11:00,507 --> 00:11:03,443
Whoo-hoo!
I get two Christmases!

268
00:11:04,877 --> 00:11:06,876
I've read
every expert on poker,

269
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:09,067
and watched
Jennifer Tilly's DVD.

270
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:10,644
Start with your senses Marnie.

271
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,358
Use the little girl voice,

272
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:14,397
and take them
for everything they've got.

273
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:18,308
Now, I'm need on the set
of Bride of Chucky V.

274
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,393
Time is money.

275
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:21,784
Money is money.

276
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:24,424
And money is college,
which can lead to more money

277
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:26,533
someday, but who knows
anymore.

278
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:54,732
Tim, what are you doing?

279
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:56,034
Bible trivia.

280
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:58,503
You've been doing that
an awful lot lately.

281
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:01,339
The Bible is rich with trivia!

282
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:04,592
I can't believe my Dad never
told me he had another wife.

283
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:07,345
The man I looked up to
my whole life.

284
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:09,180
You never looked up to him.

285
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:11,115
Well, it's a good thing I didn't

286
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,434
because I'd be pretty
devastated right now.

287
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,204
I can't believe
you're here.

288
00:12:16,238 --> 00:12:18,239
I'd finally gotten over
your father

289
00:12:18,273 --> 00:12:21,376
just a week-and-a-half ago,
and then you two show up.

290
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,978
Well, we certainly don't want
to cause you any more pain.

291
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:26,647
But we need to know everything,
no matter how shameful.

292
00:12:26,682 --> 00:12:27,749
And fast!

293
00:12:27,783 --> 00:12:30,451
I understand,
but this is hard.

294
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:31,652
Yeah.

295
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:34,655
Well, just what attracted
you to my father?

296
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,258
Beneath his mediocrity
there was genius.

297
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:39,227
Then a layer of anger.

298
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:41,329
Then a beautiful soul.

299
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:43,881
Then some more anger!

300
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,334
A lot of layers.

301
00:12:46,368 --> 00:12:48,352
(scat singing)

302
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,925
(song ends)

303
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:59,097
(sighs) <i>After we were fired from</i>
<i>Spiro's, we teamed up...</i>

304
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:01,399
<i>for more than music.</i>

305
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:05,136
Oh, Abe! (moaning)

306
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,771
Yeah!

307
00:13:06,805 --> 00:13:10,174
MARGE: <i>Mm, that kind of romance</i>
<i>leads to children.</i>

308
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:12,777
RITA:
<i>Faster than you'd think.</i>

309
00:13:12,811 --> 00:13:14,946
I was alive when
my Dad knew you?

310
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,482
Alive, but very clueless.

311
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:20,685
So this was <i>after</i>
Homer's mother left?

312
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:22,954
I love men on the rebound.

313
00:13:22,988 --> 00:13:25,256
They always think they've done
something wrong

314
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,191
and they usually come
with furniture.

315
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:29,861
My Dad had furniture?!

316
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:32,864
I don't know him at all!

317
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:35,850
RITA: <i>One day, when we were</i>
<i>walking through Proposal Park,</i>

318
00:13:35,884 --> 00:13:38,436

319
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,338
<i>We got married</i>
<i>in the city hall,</i>

320

321
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:47,378

(yelling, screaming)

323
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,202

324
00:13:58,273 --> 00:14:00,458

HOMER:<i>Hey, I'm starting to remember</i>
<i>why I don't remember so much.</i>

326
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:06,497

<i>your hospital room.</i>

327
00:14:06,532 --> 00:14:09,400
<i>Our first night together</i>
<i>as a family.</i>

328
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:11,736
<i>We didn't know</i>
<i>it would be our last.</i>

329
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,904
(phone rings)

330
00:14:12,938 --> 00:14:14,238
Hello?

331
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:19,076
Abe! They want to book us
on a European tour!

332
00:14:19,111 --> 00:14:20,761
That's fine, doll.
Real fine.

333
00:14:20,796 --> 00:14:22,079
Why, we'll...

334
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:23,614
(electricity crackling,
Homer yelling)

335
00:14:25,184 --> 00:14:26,417
(electrical buzzing)

336
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:36,244
You know, Europe's no place
for a six-year-old.

337
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:40,014
He can handle 110 volt,
but 220 would kill him.

338
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:43,217
But making music is
my dream, Abe.

339
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:44,619
<i>Our</i> dream.

340
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:46,737
I know, Sugar Tomato,

341
00:14:46,772 --> 00:14:49,040
but I'm all the family
this boy's got.

342
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:51,275
If I don't take care
of him now,

343
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,377
he'll forget the day
he's supposed to come

344
00:14:53,412 --> 00:14:56,614
and see me when I'm old.

345
00:15:01,253 --> 00:15:03,421
Are you okay, Daddy?

346
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:06,891
Well of course I'm okay!
I'm with you!

347
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:09,026
Good-bye, Rita.

348
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:11,863
This is why "life" comes before
"love" in the dictionary.

349
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:12,930
(sniffles)

350
00:15:12,965 --> 00:15:15,132
Aw, thanks, son.

351
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:18,369
Now to make sure neither
of us ever remember this.

352
00:15:25,777 --> 00:15:28,479
(sniffling):
Oh, my God.

353
00:15:28,513 --> 00:15:31,482
I never knew the sacrifices
my father made.

354
00:15:31,516 --> 00:15:33,150
Move over, Fonzie.

355
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:35,586
I've got a new hero.

356
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:37,588
I never saw Abe again.

357
00:15:37,623 --> 00:15:39,590
But I thought
you still loved him.

358
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,726
Life isn't all major chords.

359
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,929
Sometimes you gotta hit
the minor keys.

360
00:15:44,963 --> 00:15:46,264
What does that mean?

361
00:15:46,298 --> 00:15:48,432
I got super-addicted
to heroin.

362
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:50,935
(sighing)

363
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:53,854
(snoring):
Yeah.

364
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:55,923
Okay, education paid for,

365
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,125
with a gap year to find myself.

366
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,760
Every nerve
in my body is screaming

367
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:03,698
"Cash out now," and yet...
(giggles)

368
00:16:03,732 --> 00:16:05,533
I've got a pair of aces!

369
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,835
Ha! Full house!

370
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:09,604
Aces over threes!

371
00:16:09,638 --> 00:16:12,506
Take that, Rich Texan 001,

372
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,142
and Sideshow Bob @
Springfield Penitentiary-- Hah!

373
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:16,410
I'm going all in!

374
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:20,965
Aw, doggone it!

375
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:22,817
I give up!

376
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:24,785
It's like Kenny Rogers'
most famous line:

377
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,705
"This is a bad piece
of chicken."

378
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,544
He didn't fold?

379
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:35,079
But that's insane
unless he has...

380
00:16:37,232 --> 00:16:39,033
(gasps)

381
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:40,251
Four threes?!

382
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:41,569
Oh, no!

383
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:43,487
No-no-no-no-no, no!

384
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:44,805
(trilling)

385
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,173
(cash register dings)

386
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,895
(buzzing)

387
00:16:53,765 --> 00:16:56,634
I've lost, I've lost everything.

388
00:16:56,668 --> 00:16:58,753
(sobbing, muttering)

389
00:17:00,756 --> 00:17:02,323
We can all hear you.

390
00:17:02,357 --> 00:17:03,858
Please log off.

391
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:07,684
(sobbing)

392
00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:08,751
Aw, come on, Lise.

393
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:10,420
No gambling story has
a happy ending

394
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:11,688
except <i>Seabiscuit.</i>

395
00:17:11,722 --> 00:17:13,256
But you never hear about
the ruined lives

396
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,824
of the people
who bet against him.

397
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:16,559
(sobbing):
Oh, God...

398
00:17:16,593 --> 00:17:18,594
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me!

399
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:21,197
I was Ivy! Strong Ivy!

400
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:22,598
(sobs)

401
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:25,768
Oh, man, this is priceless,
but I can't keep it up.

402
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:27,971
You've still got a college fund.

403
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,206
What are you talking about?

404
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,674
I'm Sideshow Bob!

405
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,212
I've been using his
avatar to play poker

406
00:17:36,246 --> 00:17:37,647
and trash his favorite
restaurants on Yelp.

407
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,116
And I saved your
vegetarian bacon.

408
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,117
Oh, my God!

409
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:42,318
<i>You</i> won the pot?

410
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,721
You must have
nearly a million dollars!

411
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:46,823
I can go to college
and live like a Kennedy!

412
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,791
Listen, after I won,
the website found out

413
00:17:48,826 --> 00:17:50,743
we were both under 18,
so we're back

414
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,795
to the original $5,000.

415
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,630
Shame! Shame!

416
00:17:54,665 --> 00:17:57,083
Did you give the money back
to the people who lost it?

417
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,718
Good-bye.

418
00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:02,088
Well, back to square one
is a major victory

419
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,457
in this house,
but why did you help me?

420
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:07,894
Come on! Tell me!

421
00:18:07,928 --> 00:18:10,897
Because I actually like you
and felt sorry for you.

422
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:12,965
What?! You did?

423
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,801
Forget I said anything!

424
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:18,171
Sure. I have the ending
for my memoir!

425
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:20,773
I'm sorry I couldn't
help you find your father.

426
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:24,577
If you find him, tell him
I can still do this.

427
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:25,945
Yeah.

428
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,114
Holy moley.

429
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:31,050
And tell him to put on
a splash of this.

430
00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:34,020
That's Dad's cologne?

431
00:18:34,054 --> 00:18:37,123
I always thought it
was his old-man stink.

432
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:40,760
When I knew him,
it was young-man musk.

433
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:43,663
Man, you're making <i>me</i> hot
for my Dad.

434
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:49,001
Only place in town
that still sells Chicory Mist.

435
00:18:49,036 --> 00:18:52,271
After people found out
it's 98% squirrel sweat,

436
00:18:52,306 --> 00:18:53,940
they sorta stopped buying.

437
00:18:53,974 --> 00:18:55,842
Listen, do you
know this man?

438
00:18:55,876 --> 00:18:57,110
Let me ask around.

439
00:18:57,144 --> 00:18:58,978
Abe, you seen this guy?

440
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,580
Oh, I know him.

441
00:19:00,614 --> 00:19:03,049
He's a man who has no son!

442
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,083
Dad!

443
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:08,221
Abe, we were
so worried!

444
00:19:08,255 --> 00:19:10,523
Dad, promise me
you'll never wander off

445
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:13,025
and make us explore your
fascinating past again.

446
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,862
I didn't wander off,
ya big fat salami!

447
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:17,530
I ran away!

448
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:18,231
What?!

449
00:19:18,265 --> 00:19:19,632
You think I'm boring,

450
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,501
and you never visit me,

451
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,169
and I got sick
of waitin' for ya!

452
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:26,005
So I got a job and found
a new dump to live in

453
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,640
and I didn't tell you
about it,

454
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:30,376
so at least that way I know
you're not coming!

455
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:34,147
Grampa, we will never
miss a visit again.

456
00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:36,149
And there'll be
a lot more of them.

457
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:38,551
And I don't think
you're boring.

458
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:41,687
It's just that in today's
multichannel environment,

459
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,356
you have too many
great choices.

460
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,690
Look at Sunday night.

461
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,759
There's, like, eight
amazing shows.

462
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:48,327
None of them on Fox.

463
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:52,165
Well... when you put it
that way, all right.

464
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:56,536
I can't say all is forgiven,
but most is forgotten.

465
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,805
Aw...

466
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:03,609
(sighs)

467
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:05,044
I guess my honky-tonkin' days
are over.

468
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,280
(melody playing on piano
in distance)

469
00:20:07,314 --> 00:20:11,617
What the...?!
Someone's playin' my tune!

470
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,855
Don't take Grampa's meds.

471
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:17,723
I'm payin' for 'em.

472
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:21,244
(piano playing)

473
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:26,082
Hey, Abe.

474
00:20:26,116 --> 00:20:28,067
Good to see you again.

475
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,469
Rita!

476
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:31,387
You look dynamite!

477
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:33,806
And you look like you could
use a good ironing,

478
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:35,208
but I still love you.

479
00:20:35,242 --> 00:20:37,176
Take a seat. Yeah.
