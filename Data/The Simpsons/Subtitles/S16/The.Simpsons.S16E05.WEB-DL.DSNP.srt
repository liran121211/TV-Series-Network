00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,964
I'm bleeding.

00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,509
Hmm, there's no cut
on your cheek.

27
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,843

come from?

28
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,971
Hey, I got a loose tooth.

00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,476
Ew! Gross!

30
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,229
I bet you can't twist it.

31
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,147
Of course I can twist it.

32
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,398
I'm great.

33
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,901
Ow!

34
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,072
This is my last baby tooth.

35
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,865
That's the money tooth.

36
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,451
I heard the tooth fairy
pays triple for it.

37
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,495
Then let's hurry up
and rip it out of my head.

38
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,082
(tires squeal)

39
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:10,380

00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,423

42
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,511
No, thank you.

44
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,805

00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:22,809
Potato masher's stuck
in the small spoon slot.

46
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,435

would do that?

00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,604

00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,570
Ooh, Bart, honey,
I'm so sorry.

50
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,779
No problem.

51
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,533
No harm done.

52
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,659
I wouldn't say that.

53
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,579
Mm-hmm.

54
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,915
God, please give your daughter,
the Tooth Fairy,

55
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,251
the strength to carry my cash

56
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,880
and the integrity
not to dip her wand in the till.

57
00:02:58,887 --> 00:02:59,721
What the...?

58
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,140
The Tooth Fairy's made
a donation in my name

59
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,141
to the United Way?!

60
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,143
That gossamer witch!

61
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,561
Maybe when
the Tooth Fairy saw

62
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,479
it was your last
baby tooth,

63
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,940
she realized you're not
a little boy anymore.

64
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,318
So she gave you
a grownup gift.

65
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,527
I'm not going to grow up!

66
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,321
Oh, yes, you are.

67
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,739
Why in the right light,

68
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,532
you're starting to get
your own muzzle.

69
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,451
I thought
it was chocolate milk.

70
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,036
Yeah, that's how it starts.

71
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,580
No!

72
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,040
I'm still a kid.

73
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,124
And what do kids love?

74
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,959
Kid stuff like this.

75
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,127
(groans)

76
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,673
Vroom, vroom!

77
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,176
(listlessly):
Vroom... vroom.

78
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,761
Oh...

79
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,013
What you realizing, jerk?

80
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,681
That I'm not a kid anymore.

81
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,599
That's harsh.

82
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,809
I knew I was an adult
the day the judge said,

83
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,395
"We're trying you as an adult."

84
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,273
Well, there's one thing
no one can take away--

85
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,317
my childlike imagination.

86
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,318
Sergeant Activity,

87
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,819
your mission is to scale

88
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,863
the icy walls of Mt. Bloodkill.

89
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:06,704
Must defeat Dr. Blizzard
and the Avalanchoids.

90
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,336
Lieutenant Adventure,
what are you doing here?

91
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,880
You're quite the daredevil,
Sergeant Activity.

92
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,882
It's high time
you protected yourself

93
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,260
with supplemental
disability insurance.

94
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,887
At my age? Can I qualify?

95
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,222
You'd be surprised.

96
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,515
If you're a non-smoker,

97
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,600
it can cost just
a few dollars a month.

98
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,894
What's happening to me?

99
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,980
Maybe I'm not
a kid anymore.

100
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,192
Goodbye Spirogram,
goodbye Sketch-N-Etch,

117
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,330

get up now,

good luck getting a pancake.

125
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,893
Dad's pulled his chair
right up to the stove.

126
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,145
Lis, I think I'm having
a mid-life crisis.

127
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,521
If you're
feeling depressed,

128
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,565
do what I do
and write something--

129
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,567
a novel, a play.

130
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,985
Or I could write something
that's not gay.

131
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,907
(gasps)
Bart, someone wrote something

132
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,493
-cynical on your shirt.
-Mm-hmm.

133
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,828
-Let me wash it off.
-Leave me alone.

134
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,705
This expresses my rage
at the machine.

135
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,375
Well, I like T-shirts

136

Like, "Support Our Troops."

137
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,504
Bart's shirt
is a classic, Marge,

138
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,339
just like "Keep on Truckin'."

139
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,092
As if I would ever
want to <i>stop </i>truckin'.

140
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,179
Whoa.

141
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,809

Let's see.

160
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,390
"Get bent."

161
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,392
Well, the only thing
that could mean is

162
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,601
"kneel down
and pray."

163
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,228
We'll take
the whole box.

164
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,604
Get bent, everyone.

165
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,399
This could get me out of a lot
of sticky situations.

166
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,400
I'll take a dozen.

167
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,985

168
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,362

169
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,196
Sorry.

170
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,490
Ah. Well, what do you
got him peeing on?

171
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,951

172
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,786

I can't afford
to pay protection

179
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,423
Mm-hmm.

180
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,425
Well, then, you're out
of business, boy.

181
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,426
Let's go, boys.

182
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,136
Confiscate his merchandise.

183
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,848
Uh, are any of those my size?

184
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,433
Extra-extra-extra
extra-extra...

185
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,435

...extra-extra large?

186
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,853
Here you go, Chief.

187
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,731

188
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,107

190
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:06,819
BART:
It's no fair.

191
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,613
I just started,
and I'm out of business.

192
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:12,033
Why don't you go legit
and sell your shirts in stores?

193
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,660
But I'm just a kid.

194
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,412
You're a kid
no longer, Bart.

195
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,830
You've become a man.

196
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,416
Hey, you're right. I am.

197
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,417
And as an adult,

198
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,462
you'll be needing
comprehensive
insurance.

199
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,714
I'll just leave
these brochures.

200
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,301
So how can I get
my shirts in stores?

201
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,094
I bet you could
find a distributor

202
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,472
at the Springfield Novelty Expo.

203
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,599
That's right.
It's tomorrow.

it's a small retailer.

206
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,404

359
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,623
<i>...until a younger,</i>
<i>more aggressive lion</i>

360
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,125
<i>challenges his power.</i>

361
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,710
(whimpering groan)

362
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,503
(groans)

363
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,465
Oh, the couch
is like that tree.

364
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,468
<i>The displaced male</i>
<i>has two choices:</i>

365
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,262

<i>by caring</i>
<i>for vulnerable young cubs.</i>

370
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,567
Hmm.

371
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,196
Lisa, basic cable
said I should nurture you.

372
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,824
Great. Will you play
Malibu Stacy with me?

373
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,453
Okay, you be the girl
and I'll be the car.

374
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,621
(humming)

375
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,123
I'm going
to the organic market.

376
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,625
(Homer vrooms)

377
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,918
(screeches)

378

379
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,048
Screw the market,
we're going to Mexico!

380
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,049
(giggles)

381
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:28,052
Whee!

382
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,219
HOMER:
It's El Flanderino.

383
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,388
-Run him down!
-(imitating engine revving)

384
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,599
I can't run;
I'm wearing flip flops!

385
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,018

386
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,103
(both laughing)

387
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,813
Hey, what's that dealie?

388
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,524
It's my entry for the
all-school science fair.

389
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,443
It shows the history
of nuclear physics,

390
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,153
from Marie Curie's laboratory

391
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,822
to a scale model of
the first nuclear reactor.

392
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,324
Oh, you'll win
for sure.

393
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:53,452
You and science go together
like Lenny and Carl.

394
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,954
The science is Carl.

395
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,956
BOY:
Oh, Lisa!

396
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,582
I'd like to introduce you

397
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,126
to the next winner
of the science fair.

398
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,171
Behold! My project.

399
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,091
Childlike Humanoid
Urban Muchacho--

400
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,176
Or... CHUM!

401
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,095
Don't hold my hand.

402
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,346
It's creepy.

403
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,555
Hush, my pet.

404
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,434
Now let us gather
our rosebuds while we may.

405
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,061
(shivering groan)

406
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,646
A robot?!

407
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:24,274
Last year the winner
was a jar of owl pellets.

408
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,694
Oh, I don't have
a chance now.

409
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,613
Honey, all you
need's a little
help from your dad.

410
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,574
Remember, I did
used to work
at a science factory.

411
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,828
Well, we're supposed to do this
without parental help.

412
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,247
Sweetie, that's orphan talk.

413
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,873
(clanging and Homer grunting)

414
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,333
Stupid atomic pile!

415
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,420
How hard could it be
to build a reactor?

416
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:49,425
Korea did it, and look at
the quality of their animation.

417
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,927
Hmm, what to do, what to do.

418
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,014
Hey, maybe the Internet
has the information I need.

419
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,349
It certainly answered
a lot of my questions

420
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,226
about wang enhancement.

421
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:03,814

423
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,525
No.

"Would you like
to meet someone special

425
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,946
but are tired of the bar scene?"

426
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,033
No. I will never tire
of the bar scene.

427
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,118
Let's see, I can make that.

428
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,663
You can get that
by smashing open a golf ball.

429
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,583
That you can find
in any player piano.

430
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,460
All I need is some plutonium,

431
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,005
and I know just the place
to get it.

432
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:31,383
("Theme From The Pink
Panther" playing)

433
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,402
(chuckles)

434
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,073
Dad?

435
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,824
Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
Don't look.

436
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,785
Dad, what did you do?

437
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,329
Sweetie, your daddy
is going to show you

438
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,372
just how much he loves you.

439
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,667
You know that non-functioning
nuclear reactor you built?

440
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,960
Yes?

441
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,253
I juiced it up a little.

442
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,338
(giggling)

443
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,256
Dad, that could explode.

444
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,800
Oh, that's ridiculous.

445
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,678
<i>KRUSTY:</i>
<i>That thing's gonna blow!</i>

446

Drop this toy and run!

447
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,099
Mom, Dad built a device

448
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,935
that would be deadly
in the wrong hands,

449
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,561
and he's holding it.

450
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,898
Homer, I want you
to get that damn
irradiating whatsit

451
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,316
out of my home.

452
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,443
Oh, mmm, I never complain

about your
frilly pillows.

How many T-shirts
do you have here?

455
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,702
Just one.

456
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,372
It takes a Marine honor guard
to fold it.

457
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,958
It used to be a dust cover
for a Hummer.

458
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,626
I could go on and on.

459
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,546
Gravies and lentilmen,

460
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,256
I have an exciting announcement.

461
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,632
I have sold the rights

462
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,634
to the Bart Simpson
T-shirt line...

463
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,844

464
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,387
to the Disney Company,

465
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,973
which will turn each one
into a movie.

466
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,933
Really?
How much money do I get?

467
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,101
You get nothing.

468
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,061
In fact,
thanks to my team

469
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,231
of loopy lawyers...

470
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,984
I never have to give you
another penny.

471
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:15,070
All you get
is a very valuable lesson.

472
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,905
Never trust a weirdo.

473
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,490
A-zoot!

474
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,493
Ah! I'm stuck on a nail!

475
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,786
Ah-ha-ha...

476
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,913
Ow, God, that's painful.

00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,708

(loud boing)

480
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,752
What's the matter, boy?

481
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,462
Goose Gladwell ripped me off,

482
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,715
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

483
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,466
I'm just a stupid kid.

484
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,759
(crying)

485
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,012
Son, when you grew up,
I grew down,

486
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:43,348
and now I can see
you need your dad
more than ever.

487
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,768
And Homer, I can see
you need me more than ever.

488
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,770
Get back in the garage,
old man.

489
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,939
But there's spiders
in the boxes.

490
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,608
Stay out of my boxes!

491
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,318
You give my son
what he deserves,

492
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,112
or I'll knock you on your
delightfully offbeat ass.

493
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,823
(chuckling):
Whoa, I must warn you, sir.

494
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,909
I was a Green Beret
in Vietnam.

495
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:08,373
The things I saw there
are what made me <i>crazy!</i>

496
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,544
Sir, this is a class two
plutonium fission reactor.

497
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,504
If I turn this dial,

498
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,341
the resulting blast
would destroy

499
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,176
the entire Tri-City area,

500
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,304
including that guy who sells
those Blu-Blocker sunglasses

501
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,890
people sometimes wear.

502
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,726
Damn him to hell.

503
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,519
You can't be serious.

504
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,772
Are you prepared
to take that chance?

505
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,737
Okay, okay, here's
all the money I've got.

506
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,988
Not so fast.

507
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,116
I also want, um...
some dribble glasses

Well, I'm just glad
we're back

516

to me being the father
and you being the son.

517
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,718
Are you sure that thing
could really explode?

518
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,303
Oh, I doubt it.

519
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,348
