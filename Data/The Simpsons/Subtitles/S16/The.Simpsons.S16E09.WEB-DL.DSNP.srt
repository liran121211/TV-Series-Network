57
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,106
Rappers stopped saying
"illin'" 12 years ago.

59

00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,098
All too well.

78
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,642
Rap music belongs
in the rubbish bin.

79
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,478
It encourages punching,
boastfulness,

80
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,355
and rudeness to hos.

81
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,356
Step off, Mom.

82
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,525

to any concert

84
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,071

Homer, you tell your son

88
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,206
a rap show is not a safe
place for a ten-year-old.

89
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,917
Son, your mother
makes a very loud point.

90

as ten-year-old Bart Simpson
was snatched from his bed,

173
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:30,658
his chocolate milk dreams
cut short by kidnapping fiends.

174
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,452
Mrs. Simpson,
is the pain so unbearable

175
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,079
you wish your son
had never been born?

176
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,166
What a horrible thing
to say to a mother.

(crying)

178
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,879
Perhaps reading this message
aloud will comfort you.

00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,635
(crying)

181
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,762
So, mail in those
pineapple stickers today.

182
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,098
Aloha means
"one entry per person."

183
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,975
(crying)

184
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,768
I will find Bart Simpson.

185
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,187
Clancy Wiggum is on the case.

186
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,730
(laughter)

187
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,023
Chief, seriously.

188
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,441
Shouldn't we just plan
for the funeral?

189
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,319
Hey,
I crack cases all the time.

190
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,987
Like the case
of the symphony conductor

191
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,614
who murdered
his star cellist.

192
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,407
That was an episode
of <i>Columbo, </i>Chief.

193
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,825
They show you
who the bad guy is

194
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,951
at the beginning
of each one.

195
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,161
Yeah, but you have to remember.

196
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,979
This is no fun without Bart.

197
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:42,939
(sighs)

198
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,066
He used to watch me
while I did this.

199
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,359
BART: I still do.

200
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,071
Bart.

201
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,739
Are the kidnappers
after you?

202
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,075
Well, some kidnappers
might be after me.

203
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:54,951
It's a big world.

204
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,078
But in this case,
I faked the whole thing.

205
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,080
Why, are you mad at me?

206
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,331
No, it's not about you.

207
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,000
Ah, it's never about me.

208
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,377
(grunts)

209
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:07,964
Look, I need
a place to hide out

210
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:08,965
till the heat is off.

211
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,592
In my dad's apartment,
the heat is always off.

212
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,220
He made a coat out
of all my stuffed animals.

213
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,180
(shivers)

214
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,894
You can hide out
in my room.

215
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,105
My dad won't know
'cause he's at work.

216
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,940
Shoo. Get out of here.

217
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,025
These aren't your soybeans.

218
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,208
Wow, I should have read these
headlines a long time ago.

219
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,711
Together,
they really paint a picture...

220
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,421
of failure.

221
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,923
And now my only friend
is the bottle.

222
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,265
(munching)

223
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,267
(snoring)

224
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,603
<i>MAN: Rise and shine,</i>
<i>Chief Wiggum.</i>

225
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,147
<i>This pity party is over.</i>

226
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,232
Wha... officer down... huh?

227
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,568
Barney Fife.

228
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,613
Y-E-S spells you got it,
buster.

229
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,532
And I'm here to tell you
the feelings you're having

230
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,328
are common for every (sniffs)
brother of the badge.

231
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,747
Well, my fat grew over
my badge.

232
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,833
Aw, sour mash.

233
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,793
It's time for you
to roll up your sleeves

234
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,422
and get the old (sniffs)
crime sniffer out
on the street.

235
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,340
You're right.

236
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,925
I've gotta buckle down
and do some police work.

237
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:39,430
Now that's the can-do attitude
that puts dudes in the can.

238
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,390
(chuckles)

239
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,517
Well, I'm wanted
back on the set.

240
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,479
Set? Are you the character
or the actor who plays him?

241
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,231
(spookily):
Now I must go...

242
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,566
Wait a minute,
now you're a ghost?

243
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,403
Avenge me.

244
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,198
(phone ringing)

245
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,074
Hello?

246
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,201
<i>BART (angrily):</i>
<i>This is the kidnapper.</i>

247
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,995
Do what I say
and Bart won't get hurt.

248
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:03,829
Oh, yeah?

249
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,373
Send a finger wrapped
in today's paper

250
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,374
to prove you have him.

251
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,208
Homer!

252
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,209
I know what I'm doing.

253
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,835
You can use
any section of the paper.

254
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,463
Except Metro.
It's a big snooze.

255
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,256
Please give me back my boy.

256
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,843
I just want to tell him
I love him one more time.

257
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,679
(sobbing)

258
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,846
Mom, it's me.

259
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,932
Don't cry, I'm okay.

260
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,101
The kidnappers say
if you worry too much...

261
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,602
they'll kill me.

262
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,230
(sobbing)

263
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,525
-Uh, no, no, I mean...
-(popping)

264
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,235
Okay,
you made your point.

265
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,486
Gotta go.

266
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,156
All right, boys.

267
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,784
Let's get this tape back
to the lab for analysis.

268
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,702
We have a lab?

269
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,246
Yeah, it's that room we keep
the Christmas decorations in.

270
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,790
<i>BART: No, no, I mean...</i>

271
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,000
What is that noise
in the background?

272
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,504
Maybe I can isolate it.

273
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,341
(popping)

274
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,301
I know I've heard
that noise before.

275
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,137
Think, Clancy, think.

276
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,722
Hail falling on a tin roof?

277
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,766
No.

278
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,809
That's it!

279
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,686
Stovetop popcorn.

280
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,523
And it sounds like my favorite
brand-- Chintzy-Pop!

281
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,774
Eddie, Lou,

282
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,651
we're going
to the Kwik-E-Mart.

283
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,528
You already sent us
there twice today.

284
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,904
Nah, that was for snacks.

285
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,032
This time...
it's not personal.

286
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,242
<i>WIGGUM:</i>
<i>I need the name of everyone</i>

287
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,369
who buys Chintzy-Pop popcorn.

288
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,622
Oh, Chintzy-Pop
is the worst legal popcorn.

289
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,750
Many of the kernels
are baby teeth.

290
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,001
There are only
two idiots

291
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,003
cheap enough to buy
this crap.

292
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,045
You and...

293
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,298
Oh, baby,
is there anything better

294
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:41,177
than video poker
and Chintzy-Pop?

295
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,011
Whoa!

296
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,680
I'm looking
at an inside straight.

297
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,140
(buzzer sounds)

298
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:49,643
Oh, some day I'll hear
the winning music.

299
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,895
Some day.

300
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,398
Drop the corn,
tightey-whitey!

301
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,941
What?
I didn't do anything.

302
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,277
We'll let a judge be
the judge of that.

303
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,862
Yo, Chief,
we found the kid!

304
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,323
Wow. For once
I did everything right.

305
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,324
What's going on?

306
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,618
I didn't know he was here.
I swear!

307
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:06,786
Uh, Chief...

308
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,623
Is Milhouse's Dad
gonna be in trouble?

309
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,333
He's not really a bad guy.

310
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,001
Now, now,
there's no need for you

311
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,629
to defend your captor,
Bratty Hearst.

312
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,590
We're putting you
in a dirty little cell.

313
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,801
Not as small and dirty
as this apartment,

314
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,053
but you know,
it's still pretty bad.

315
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:32,603
Oh, Bart, I'm so glad
you're okay.

316
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,105
Oh, son.

317
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,525
Taking your tombstone
back to the store

318
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,402
will be the happiest thing
I've ever done.

319
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,404
<i>¡Ay caramba!</i>

320
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,744
Chief, we're sorry
we didn't have faith in you.

321
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:49,662
And I'm sorry
I wrote those

322
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,997
letters-to-the-editor
calling for your ouster.

323
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,166
You're "Worried
In West Springfield?"

324
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,501
Not any more, Chief.

325
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,919
Not any more.

326
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,048
Keep those rose petals coming.

327
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:04,218
I almost stepped
on regular ground back there.

328
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:08,305
(crowd cheering)

329
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,893
Bart, two, three, four!

330
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,313
You put my Dad in jail,
flip, spin, twirl!

331
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,399
Milhouse, if you tell anyone,
I'll tell the world

332
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,192
you wet your pants
watching <i>Harry Potter.</i>

333
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,862
I wasn't scared,
I was just peeing.

334
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,613
Look, if you tell
what I did,

335
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,865
I'll get in trouble.

336
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,408
You gotta do
something.

337
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,410
I want my Dad back!

338
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,120
(grunts)

339
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,291
(playing
"Stars and Stripes")

340
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,767
You've got the perfect build
for a suit-- 44 regular.

341
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,686
(whispering):
56 huge.

342
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,355
Boys, even though I've been
made Police Commissioner,

343
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,607
don't think
I've forgotten you.

344
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,026
Lou, you're promoted
to Chief of Police.

345
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:02,985
Sweet.

346
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,737
And Eddie,
you're promoted to Lou.

347
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,863
Nice.

348
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,364
And, uh,
who's gonna be Eddie?

349
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,365
We don't need an Eddie.

350
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,036
Commissioner Wiggum,

351
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,412
I need
to confess something.

352
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,622
Is it that you're proud
of me?

353
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,417
I lied about
being kidnapped.

354
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,085
The whole thing
was a hoax.

355
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,630
A hoax? A hoax?!

356
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,298
(groans)

357
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,132
Bart, please,

358
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,592
you can't take this
away from me.

359
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,302
How would I explain it
to Ralphie?

360
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,637
That kid can't understand

361
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,680
where the world goes
when you close the drapes.

362
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,016
But...
what about Milhouse's Dad?

363
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,810
Hey, this is the best thing
that ever happened
to that loser.

364
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,896
Women love famous felons.

365
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,148
(women screaming)

366
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:45,277
Kirk, you are so dangerous--
and misunderstood!

367
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,279
You've kidnapped my heart!

368
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,365
I love the way
I've heard of you!

369
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,118
So Bart, as you can see,

370
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,995
from what I just said,

371
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,372
everyone is a winner here.

372
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,962
(birds squawking)

373
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,213
Huh?

374
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,173
(gasps)

375
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,804
A shirt from that rap concert.
Bart must've gone to the show.

376
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:12,930
But that means...

377
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,807
Bart was never
kidnapped?

378
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,559
Lisa, I'm very glad
you brought me this.

379
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,689
I'll see that it gets
to the proper authorities.

380
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,982
Dad!?

381
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,274
Why did you do that?

382
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,527
Hollywood producers
have paid me a fortune,

383
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,487
which I've already lost,

384
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,155
for the rights
to Bart's story.

385
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,991
So I have to destroy anything

386
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,410
that proves
that story's not true.

387
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,164
Why did you burn up
your shirt?

388
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,542
What shirt?
I don't see any shirt.

389
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,257
Burn the truth.
Burn the truth.

390
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,967
(sighs)

391
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,260
So you see,
Principal Skinner,

392
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,303
that's why I had
to come to you.

393
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,514
Wait, why did your father
burn his pants?

394
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,724
It doesn't matter.

395
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,726
The point is...
only with your help

396
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,228
can I expose Bart's lies.

397
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,480
A chance to bring down
Bart Simpson?

398
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,191
Our school's second most-wanted
criminal after the mysterious

399
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,610
El Barto?

400
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,405
Sign me up!

401
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,866
Boys, let me tell ya.
Now that I'm commissioner,

402
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,827
the shaves are hotter,
the steaks are thicker

403
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,830
and I've got
my own private bathroom,
so Lou here

404
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,207
won't be using
my sonic toothbrush

405
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,252
on his rotten choppers--
Yuck!

406
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,212
Uh, listen,
Commissioner.

407
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,214
Lisa Simpson
came by the office today,

408
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,383
asking questions about her
brother's kidnapping.

409
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,259
Questions?

410
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,844
Yes, as if she were
trying

411
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,013
to unravel
a tapestry of deceit.

412
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,855
All right, people,
we got a situation here.

413
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,775
Your daughter's gonna blow
our whole deal sky high.

414
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,861
You leave Maggie to me.

415
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,112
No, Lisa.

416
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:52,946
Not her!

417
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,115
She'll hunt us down
relentlessly--

418
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,619
like a bloodhound mixed
with a student loan officer.

419
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,037
Hey, I can't leave this place!

420
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,705
I get three square
meals a day

421
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,250
and trailer time with
Springfield's craziest chicks.

422
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,877
(screaming)

423
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,921
Hey, I got
the most to lose here.

424
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,256
I just printed up
10,000 business cards.

425
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,634
How am I going to pass
all these out
before she catches me?

426
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,968
Give me
a call sometime!

427
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:15,803
Give me a call sometime!

428
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,596
Ah! Here comes the panic!

429
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,472
People, please.

430
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,349
The only way
Lisa can bust me.

431
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:24,645
Is if she finds
someone who can prove
I was at that rap show.

432
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,855
And I know just where she can
find that someone.

433
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,191
Let's go cover our asses!

434
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,443
Wait, before we go,
I took the liberty of making

435
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,530
these embroidered conspiracy
jackets for all of us.

436
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,282
Wow, those jackets
are beautiful.

437
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,826
We must never wear them.

438
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,542
Mr. Alcatraaaz,
my name is Lisa Simpson

439
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,960
and this is
Principal Skinner.

440
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,461
Hi.
Would you mind showing us

441
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,463
video footage
of your last concert?

442
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,048
No problem.

443
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,093
I've got
a 200-inch plasma TV.

444
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,886
In my shoe closet.

445
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,264
(laughing)

446
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,765
(chuckles)

447
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,059
I'm sharing a laugh
with my new friends.

448
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,104
♪ Homer is a fat load ♪

449
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:10,065
CROWD:
♪ Homer is a fat load ♪

450
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,985
This proves Bart lied
about being kidnapped.

451
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:13,902
Not yet.

452
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,531
Can we verify exactly
what time Bart was at the show?

453
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,745
If only we had
the exact date.

454
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,249
Bingo!

455
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,501
Thank you,
Mr. Alcatraaaz.

456
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,586
Ain't nothin'.

457
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,838
Ah, ah, ah.
"It <i>is </i>nothing."

458
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,090
It's idiomatic, biatch.

459
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:35,924
(grunts)

460
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,635
All right, hand over the tape
and nobody gets hurt.

461
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,721
(guns cocking)

462
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,347
Ah, this is hopeless.

463
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,224
My gun isn't even loaded.

464
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,350
Aw, nuts.

465
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,687
They're gonna release that tape
and our hoax will be exposed.

466
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,315
Well, I guess
I'll go back to Baltimore

467
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,400
and sell ribbon
with my Daddy.

468
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,985
Ribbon! Get your ribbon!

469
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,029
Great for presents!

470
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:57,863
(sighs)

471
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:58,822
Wait a minute.

472
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,407
Why do we have
to come clean?

473
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,533
Nobody's been hurt.

474
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,535
Everyone's happier
with the lie.

475
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,579
The lie is love.

476
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,247
Wait just a minute.

477
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,582
Love the lie!

478
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,585
The way I was raised,
by Mom,

479
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,880
I learned the truth
can't be swept under the rug.

480
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,924
That's a very noble
sentiment, Lisa.

481
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,176
But for once in your life,
can't you just be cool?

482
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,886
Yeah, be cool.
Like us.

483
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,596
Coolee, coolee cool!

484
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,430
Come on, fool!

485
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,349
Be coolee, coolee cool!

486
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,394
-(guns cocking)
-(shrieks)

487
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,813
Yo, put away
your Glocks, man.

488
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,482
Yes, share with us
the wisdom

489
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,901
of the street,
oh, mighty Alcatraaaz.

490
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:39,404
There are times in life
when the truth
ain't black nor white,

491
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,865
but a subtler
shade of gray, yo.

492
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,784
And when the path of justice

493
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:47,079
is obscured
by the fog of uncertainty,

494
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,414
there is only one solution.

495
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,916
House party!

496
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:56,546
(rap music playing)

497
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,261
I don't understand.

498
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,055
After all the corruption
and deceit we've witnessed,

499
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,974
how can everyone
just party?

500
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,977
Lisa, the world is
a very complicated place.

501
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,979
When you get
right down to it...

502
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,272
Cannonball!

503
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,614
Do you think
there's a place

504
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,658
in the hip-hop world
for a 40-something

505
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,326
elementary school
administrator?

506
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,369
Hell yes.

507
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,203
Mmm.

508
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,455
But I'm already payin'
a guy for that.

509
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,290
Skinner!

510
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,710
I order you to step off,
dog.

511
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,169
(laughing)

512
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,171
I think they're making
fun of me,

513
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,215
but my wife
is very sick.

514
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,238
Shh!
