Bart, where did
you get those?

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,721
There's an open house next door.

15
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:57,307
They're giving out

Check it out.
I'm a business jerk!

17
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,105
Marge, I don't want
to buy this house.

18
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,609

We're only here
to compare our lifestyle
to our neighbors.

25
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,622
Oh, come on, Marge.

26
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,833
It's not fair to compare us
to an American household.

27
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,460
(gasps)

28
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:29,339
It's so beautiful

00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:33,593
Ooh, a Sub-Zero fridge.

30
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,846
A slightly colder fridge?

31
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,974
In my lifetime? Amazing.

32
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,478
This is the kitchen
I've always wanted.

00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,480

Hey, Marge, can you press "stop"
when my popcorn's done?

38
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,744
Uh-oh.

44
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,589
Homie, when I married you,

45
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,424
I knew we wouldn't
live in luxury.

46
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,926
And I kept that vow.

47
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,344
(table leg cracks)

48
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,847
But seeing that kitchen today

49
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,517
made me wish we had something
a little better for ourselves.

50
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,561
I'll build you
a new kitchen, sweetie.

51
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,647
Aww, Homie...
that's so thoughtful,

52
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,775
but maybe we should hire
a professional contractor.

53
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,402
A contractor?

54
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,612
Those guys are
the biggest crooks around.

55
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,699
They charge for materials
<i>and </i>labor!

56
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,534
Pick one, jerks!

00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,451

59
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,132
Man, that hurt.

60
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,341
And now to do

61
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,219
the exact same thing again.
(painful groans)

62
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,140
Maybe you should
turn off the power.

63
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,517
All right.

64
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,646
Don't demolish along the way!

65
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,981
Fine.

66
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,025
Easy, easy.

67
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,988
<i>Playdude </i>magazines?

68
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,449
Have you been hiding
bosom rags from me?

69
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,867
Trying to.

70
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,120
These magazines are from
before we were married.

71
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,747
Maybe you should
throw them away.

72
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,498
But I need them
for the articles!

73
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,751
The articles, eh?

74
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:34,464
So you wouldn't mind if
I cut out all the erotic nudes?

75
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,007
Of course not.

76
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,800
Why would I want
to look at a nude woman

77
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,802
I'm not even married to?

78
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,056
I mean, I wouldn't even know
how she could improve me.

79
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,977
"I'm not wearing any clothes.

80
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,606
So why don't I just splay
myself on a pool table"?

81

82
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,443

83
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,614
Okay, here's
your precious articles.

84
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,450
Thanks, Marge,
I can't wait to read

85
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,161
about "Sport Fishing
with Sonny Jurgensen."

86
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,746

What man would want you now?

00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,129
Whoa! <i>Playdudes!</i>

89
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,174
Let the blossoming
of Milhouse begin.

90
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,969
I gotta be honest,

91
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,845
I don't see what
all the hubbub is about.

92
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,431
Hey, the lady
in this picture is hot.

93
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,434
She can Calamine
my hives anytime.

94
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,020
That's Congresswoman
Bella Abzug.

95
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,855
MILHOUSE:
Ciao Bella.

96
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,692
The grown-ups in
this magazine are pretty cool.

97
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,194
I could make the tree house
look like this.

98
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,947
Then we could have orgies,
whatever they are.

99
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,200
We'll be Playdude
Playmates!

100
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,828
BOTH:
We are Playdude Playmates!

101
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,038
We are Playdude Playmates!

102
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,624
There it is,
nice and smooth.

103
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,878
I'd like to see your boyfriend
the contractor do a better job.

104
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,798
I think you used
too much plaster.

105
00:04:58,881 --> 00:04:59,924
Oh, now you tell me.

106
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,926
I never stopped telling you.

107
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,887
So that's what that
white noise was.

108
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,641
I'm calling a contractor.

109
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,270
Thanks for taking the job.

110
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,481
I'm sorry my husband
is being so difficult.

111
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,608
Get lost, crook!

112
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,235
That's all right,
Mrs. Simpson.

113
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,653
Many husbands
feel emasculated

114
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,031
when their wife must turn
to a professional

115
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,866
to satisfy her
remodeling needs.

116
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,242
(grumbling):
Why don't you just kiss her?

117
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,243
I'm gay.

118
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,453
But I have a subcontractor

119
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,538
that does that sort
of thing for me.

120
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,957
I like-a to kiss.

121
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,667
(kissing)

122
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,668
Now, don't you worry.

123
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,628
Your kitchen will be
done in three weeks.

124
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,258
When Virginia Woolf wrote,

125
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,719
"Every woman needs
a room of one's own,"

126
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,722
she must have been talking
about the kitchen.

127
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,266
What's the first thing you're
gonna make in your new kitchen?

128
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,309
How 'bout cooking up some money

129
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:55,313
because this stupid kitchen
cost $100,000.

130
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,315
(sobbing)

131
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,734
I was thinking
of chicken wings.

132
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:00,777
Those are good too.

133
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,448
Same old stuff:

134
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:10,703
meatloaf, casserole, tuna loaf,
loaferole, casseloaf...

135
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,248
Marge Simpson's
Wasabi Buffalo Wings!

136
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:18,753
Ooh, an Eastern twist on
a western New York favorite.

137
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,426
These wings are going straight
to my thighs...

138
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,470
and I say bon voyage!

139
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,765
What do you think,
Thomas Pynchon?

140
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,769
These wings
are "V-licious!"

141
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:35,770
I'll put this recipe

142
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,980
in the <i>Gravity's</i>
<i>Rainbow Cookbook,</i>

143
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:42,026
right next to
<i>The Frying of Latke 49.</i>

144
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,613
I agree with my fellow
Cornell alumnus!

145
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,073
Huzzah for Marge!

146
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,324
ALL:
Huzzah!

147
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,326
And how 'bout a huzzah
for my husband

148
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,953
who paid for our new kitchen?

149
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,204
Never!

150
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,957
Marge, you know, I thought

151
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,418
I was Springfield's
wing ding king, but, uh,

152
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,753
you make my chicken look
like cock-a-diddily doo-doo.

153
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,338
Great stuff, Ned.

154
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,383
You know I was gonna enter
this here Ovenfresh Bakeoff...

155
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,386
but up against you, I wouldn't
have a Hindu's chance in heaven.

156
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,471
If you win,
Ovenfresh Industries

157
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,474
will make you the new face
of Auntie Ovenfresh.

158
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,479
C'mon, Marge.
It's either you, or...

159
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:24,026
I guess it would be a hoot
to have my face on everything.

160
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,571
Oh, Mrs. Simpson,
you must pursue your dreams.

161
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,781
Like my old dream
of coming to America

162
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,366
and starting a family.

163
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,368
Or my new dream
of ditching my family

164
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,205
and sneaking back
to India in disguise.

165
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,999
Apu? Never heard of him.

166
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,501
My name is Steve Barnes.

167
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,420
(instrumental music playing)

168
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,049
So, when do they
start singing?

169
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,552
Well, The <i>Playdude </i>Advisor
says this music

170
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,929
will get a stewardess
to give you a layover.

171
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,556
I hope it's in Omaha.

172
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,057
My grammy lives there.

173
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,143
MARGE:
Bart, can you come in here
for a second?

174
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,440
Your mother's about
to show us her new recipe.

175
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,401
Outta sight!
Lay it on me, Mama.

176
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,028
In the Ovenfresh Bakeoff,

177
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:10,406
clever presentation
is as important as taste.

178
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,618
So I'm entering
my dessert dogs!

179
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:17,538
It's deep-fried cookie dough
with meringue buns,

180
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,125
cherry "ketchup"
and caramel "mustard."

181
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,214
Mmm! It's dessert,
but it's hot dogs,

182
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,298
so it's good for you!

183
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,677
Marge, I don't want
to freak you out,

184
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,888
but I think I love you.

185
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,976
I hope the Ovenfresh Bakeoff
likes them as much as you do.

186
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,651
Mom, a letter
from Ovenfresh Industries!

187
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,986
Well, open it.
Open it! Open it!

188
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,533
"Thank you for applying
to the Ovenfresh Bakeoff.

189
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:57,286
Every year many wonderful cooks
fail to qualify."

190
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,287
(sighs)

191
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,457
"...but screw them, you're in!
Congratulations!"

192
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,667
Oh, my God!

193
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,296
Someone somewhere says
I'm better than someone else!

194
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,966
I'm proud of you, honey.

195
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,512
(sobbing)

196
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,721
Sorry, Ralphie.

197
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,516
The Bakeoff
rejected your recipe.

198
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,518
I wanna be in the bakeoff!

199
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,352
There, there.

200
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,522
I think your grilled
crayon sandwich was delicious.

201
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,524
You only had a pretend bite.

202
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,526
No, I'm eating it.

203
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:32,488
Look.
Mmm.

204
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,907
Can you taste
the thumbtacks?

205
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:35,908
Uh, crap.

206
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,000
<i>I'm here live at the annual</i>
<i>Ovenfresh Bakeoff,</i>

207
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,335
<i>brought to you</i>
<i>by the Ovenfresh Flour</i>

208
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,004
<i>family of products,</i>

209
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,556
<i>Quetzalcoatl's Choice:</i>

210
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,767
<i>the favorite from Zihuatanejo</i>
<i>to Popocatepetl.</i>

211
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,979
Ha-ha! Bart looks
different today.

212
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,648
Ah, Nelson,
your debonair wit

213
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,734
reminds me
of a young Mort Sahl.

214
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,526
Guh?

215
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,278
Listen up,
ring-a-ding-dingers.

216
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,946
I'm throwin'
a little sip 'n' quip

217
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,573
at the Playdude Treehouse

218
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,117
Saturday night
at the top of the ladder.

219
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,371
Be there or be square.

220
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,664
(chattering)

221
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,166
I want to be
a triangle.

222
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,167
You're not invited.

223
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,961
It's going to be weird
cooking

224
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,881
without your tipsy father
grabbing me from behind,

225
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,424
but I think I'm up to it.

226
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,801
Welcome to the
Ovenfresh Bakeoff.

227
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,803
I'm Billy Bouillon Cube.

228
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,265
Follow me
to your oven station.

229
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,601
Why, thank you, Billy.

230
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,312
Don't look
at my human eyes!

231
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,980
Oh, don't mind Billy.

232
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,774
His oven light's on,
but nothing's cooking.

233
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:50,816
(chuckles)

234
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,027
So, what you makin'...
Marge?

235
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,779
Well... Stuart,

236
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,113
I'm making a dessert

237
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,783
that looks like a hot dog,
but it isn't.

238
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,993
You're making a "tasty fake"?

239
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,205
(chuckles):
That is so '90s.

240
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,999
Why don't we all move to Seattle
and use slow modems?

241
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,543
(laughter)

242
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,632
Yo, Marge, your recipe--
she is pathetic.

243
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,301
She is not!

244
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,011
(playing jazz music)

245
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,348
Great licks, man, great licks.

246
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,228
Yo, Bart, there's no room
left in the grotto.

247
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,064
Who's that adult?

248
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,650
Hey, it wouldn't be a Playdude
party without James Caan.

249
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,152
So, I'm trying to talk
with Miss November,

250
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,072
and Charlie Callas over here
is blocking my action with...

251
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,824
(hooting like Charlie Callas)

252
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,659
Turns out he's choking
on a peanut.

253
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,619
Well, a punch to the gut
cleared that right up.

254
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,829
(kids laughing)

255
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,164
Bart, me and Mrs. Krabappel--

256
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,166
uh, we're going to go play
some "backgammon,"

257
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,042
if you know what I mean.

258
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,044
I don't,
but I hope you win.

259
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,170
Oh, he's going to win.

260
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,673
Some guys like a challenge.
Not me.

261
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,509
Ladies and gentlemen,

262
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,679
before we begin, let us
introduce Auntie Ovenfresh,

263
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,889
1954!

264
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:08,519
Ribbons and trophies
are no comfort on your deathbed.

265
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,438
Auntie Ovenfresh!

266
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,689
(chuckling)

267
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,608
And now, chefs,
start your kitchens!

268
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:20,823
(gasps)

269
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,118
Hmm? Fish scales?

270
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,746
Stop! You're
tainting my entry!

271
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,247
Oh, I'm-a so sorry.

272
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,416
It was, uh,
how you say, um,

273
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,127
"done with malice
aforethought," yes?

274
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,087
You did it on purpose?

275
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,172
No, no, no, no, no, no,
my English--

276
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,715
she's a-not-a so good.

277
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,759
I was, uh, how you say, uh,

278
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,678
uh, "ruining your food
so I win," yes?

279
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,139
(sighs):
Why is everyone
at this bakeoff

280
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,558
such a meanie-bo-beanie?

281
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,602
These muffin-huffin'
batter biddies

282
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,729
can smell weakness
a mile away...

283
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,147
weakness named Marge!

284
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,733
Why can't everyone
just play fair and...?

285
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:59,487
Did you just dunk your hair
in my mixing bowl?

286
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,614
You're weak, weak!

287
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,700
CHIEF WIGGUM:
Listen here, Simpson.

288
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,702
Your son has been exposing
our kids

289
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,330
to adult themes,
unabashed dictionaries

290
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,124
and the lesser short fiction
of John Cheever.

291
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,376
Adult themes?
What are you talking about?

292
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,338
My Roddy told a joke
about an octopus
and a set of bagpipes,

293
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,965
and the punch line implied
that they fornicated!

294
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,759
Ralphie wants to go
on the pill!

295
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,177
Stupid Bart.

296
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,764
(laughing):
Bagpipes getting down
with an octopus.

297
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:27,765
That's classic.

298
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,391
Hot bananas
coming through.

299
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,601
-Oops.
-(screams)

300
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,020
(gasps):
My dessert!

301
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,647
(shrieking)

302
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,360
(sobbing)

303
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,946
Come on, Mom.
You still have 20 minutes left.

304
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,656
You can fix it.

305
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,949
You're right.

306
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,575
If I can feed a family of five

307
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,745
on $12 a week,
I can do anything.

308
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,164
You feed us
on $12 a week?

309
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,125
I stretch your father's
meatloaf with sawdust.

310
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,214
Attention,
contestants,

311
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,799
baking time is over.

312
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,884
The judging will commence
in one hour.

313
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,803
If your dish
is not in the judging room

314
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,472
by the time this metal door
hits the ground,

315
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,015
your entry will not be official

316
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,559
and will be eaten
by the janitor.

317
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,560
(beeps)

318
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,813
Hurry, Mom!

319
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,611
Whew! I guess
I was the last one.

320
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,863
-(metal clanging)
-Damn it!

321
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,780
(thuds)

322
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,786
These other dishes look
so pretty.

323
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,789
And those cheaters blackened
my sugar wieners.

324
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,875
I'd like to give
those Betty Crookeds

325
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,628
a taste of their own medicine.

326
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,840
Yes... medicine.

327
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,843
Baby ear medicine.

328
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,554
(laughing)

329
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,141
(groans)

330
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,727
Even the Pope couldn't
forgive this pizza,

331
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,563
and he's letting a lot
of things slide these days.

332
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,816
Don't worry.
There's plenty for all of you.

333
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,736
Now who's laughing, huh, huh?

334
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,237
(laughing)

335
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,239
Me! I'm laughing!

336
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,324
(laughing)

337
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,546
I can't believe
my mom would cheat.

338
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,256
Hey, sweetie,
is Mom winning?

339
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,841
Oh, she'll win
the contest,

340
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,885
but she'll lose her soul.

341
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,470
But she'll still win
the contest?

342
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,930
And lose her soul.

343
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:31,931
But win the contest?

344
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,474
-Yes.
-Whoo-hoo!

345
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,559
If Marge becomes
Auntie Ovenfresh,

346
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,479
we'll meet all
the food personalities...

347
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,898
Look!

348
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,399
It's Mr. Cashew,

349
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,026
the Koobler Dwarfs,

350
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,903
Snip, Crinkle
and Poof...

351
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,280
Twinkle the Kidd,
I love you!

352
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,281
(grunts)

353
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,909
Whoa-ho-ho,
easy there, partner.

354
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,037
(dying gurgle)

355
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,080
Uh-oh.

356
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,583
You... killed him.

357
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,169
He was my world!

358
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,465
ALL (chanting):
Blood for creme!

359
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,467
Blood for creme!

360
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,929
Blood for creme.

361
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,723
It's always difficult
to pick two finalists,

362
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,141
but this year it was easy.

363
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,977
All the other dishes
made us vomit.

364
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,770
(gagging)

365
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,105
Our two remaining dishes are

366
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,523
"Blackened Dessert Dogs"

367
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,024
by Marge Simpson

368
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,610
and "Armadillo a la Road"

369
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,529
by Brandine
No Last Name Given.

370
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,365
That's an entry?!
I thought it was garbage.

371
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,409
Just 'cause it was cooked
in a garbage can

372
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,785
don't make it garbage.

373
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:38,038
(laughs)

374
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,081
(groans)

375
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,420
"Canned and frozen juices
are more popular

376
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,546
than ever these days...

377
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,631
but most bachelors we know

378
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,634
would prefer to squeeze
their own tomatoes."

379
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,804
(laughing)

380
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,640
Bachelors are always
squeezin' stuff.

381
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,183
Would you excuse us,
Milton?

382
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,935
It's Milhouse.

383
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,813
Yeah, and your father's
"No House". Now scram.

384
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,190
Aw...

385
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,151
Maybe I was a
little hard on him.

386
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,653
Oh, well. Bart, I know
a father has no right

387
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,822
to pry into the life
of his ten-year-old son,

388
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,866
-but what's going
on up here?
-I'm just spreadin'

389
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,159
the <i>Playdude </i>philosophy:

390
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,578
hi-fis, Norman Mailer,
gettin' some...

391
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:21,081
Uh, um... what do
you think "some" is?

392
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,875
Uh... Toys?

393
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,419
(sighs):
I thought I'd never
have to do this,

394
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,963
but it's time to tell
you the facts of life.

395
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,426
Do you know
what a <i>boob </i>is?

396
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:33,427
Oh, yeah.

397
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,428
Good, that'll save us

398
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,138
some time. Okay.

399
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,933
Why do you think your mother
and I sleep in the same bed?

400
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,351
Because we're poor?

401
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,563
Exactly, and we're poor
because we have kids.

402
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,691
And the biological method
by which children are created

403
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,985
by a man
and a woman is...

404
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,196
(Bart screams)

405
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,824
BART:
And then the man...

406
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,161
(Bart and Milhouse scream)

407
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,330
BART AND MILHOUSE:
And then the woman...

408
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,457
(Bart, Milhouse,
Uter, and Martin scream)

409
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,585
(kids screaming)

410
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,964
Well, it's better
they hear it from me now

411
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,258
than from their parents
when they're old enough.

412
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,431
Congratulations, Mom.

413
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,392
You seem to have a <i>prescription</i>
for success.

414
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,687
What a kind yet oddly ominous
thing to say.

415
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,773
Now I've got to get ready
for the finals.

416
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,025
Don't forget
your secret ingredient...

417
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,652
cheating!

418
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,404
Well, it's
not my fault!

419
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,406
Lisa, the people
in this bakeoff

420
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,076
are stinkers who pushed me
and pushed me

421
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,120
like the pushy-wushies
they are!

422
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,247
Mom, if I don't have you
to look up to,

423
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,915
I don't have anyone.

424
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,709
Look, I'll be a winner
with feet of clay...

425
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,211
like Mickey Mantle.

426
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,754
Everyone loves the Mick.

427
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,089
I don't want
Mickey Mantle.

428
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,423
I want my mom.

429
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,926
Hey, plenty of kids
are going to look up to me

430
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,428
when I'm Auntie...
whatever it is.

431
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,597
Right now, people just know me

432
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,600
as the wife of a guy
who doesn't go to work.

433
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,937
Can't you understand
that I need this?

434
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,818
(sighs):
I guess Dad has to be
my hero now.

435
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:16,029
Not if you knew
what he's been doing.

436
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,323
Welcome to
the final battle

437
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,325
of the Ovenfresh Challenge.

438
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,119
Ooh, she's already ahead of me.

439
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,628
Well, I didn't come this far
not to cheat.

440
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,380
Huh?

441
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,174
"I look up to you...

442
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,093
because you let me down."

443
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,016
That's clever...
and devastating.

444
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,601
Hmm...

445
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,436
Stop the competition!

446
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,437
AUDIENCE:
Wha...?!

447
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,023
I don't deserve to win.

448
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,525
I sabotaged
all the other entries.

449
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,776
(audience gasping)

450
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,778
Looks like me and Marge
are both going to hell.

451
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,572
That's when I'll make my move.

452
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:02,993
Then I won... with my festive
holiday Alco-Hog.

453
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,330
Huh. I thought
it was dead.

454
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,957
(moaning)

455
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,919
Thanks, honey,
for saving me from myself.

456
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,923
And Marge, you'll always be
the best chef in our house.

457
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,674
Eh, B.F.D.

458
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,343
I've had your
scrambled eggs, Homer.

459
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,470
The secret ingredient
is whiskey.

460
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,722
Hey, it keeps
the kids quiet.

461
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:25,974
Hey, look!

462
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,976
The new Ovenfresh Flour bag!

463
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,811
Yeah, that could've been me.

464
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,813
CLETUS:
Oh, I wish
it had've been.

465
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,023
(whimpers)

466
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,942
Now that Brandine's famous,

467
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,276
she done run off

468
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,945
with James Caan!

469
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,614
But don't you worry.

470
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,866
I'm going to fix his wagon.

471
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,078
A toll booth?

472
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,247
I hate these things.

473
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,306
That's it.
Next time, I fly.

474
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,395
Shh!
