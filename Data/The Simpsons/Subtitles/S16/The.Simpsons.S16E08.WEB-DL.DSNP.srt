so run-down.

Oh, this whole place

11
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,544
I agree.

Hey! Aren't you that crazy

13
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,257
Yes, I am.

00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,092
But thanks to this
psychoactive medication,

00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,636
I enjoy brief moments

00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,023
I'm gonna organize

111

But if I add
your shameless shenanigans,

113
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,679
I'll be on ESPN
every night.

114
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,973
You wanna do my dance
after you score?

115
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,182

why Daddy's not at work again.

00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,219

131

choreographing end zone dances

133
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,518
Looks like all you're teaching

134
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,937
is obnoxiousness
and poor sportsmanship.

135

But with this
new video camera,

148
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,970
we can make
our own entertainment.

149
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,180
Now boys, we're gonna

152
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,939
Daddy, if Cain and Abel were
Adam and Eve's only children,

153
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,774
how did they make more babies?

154
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,984
Did they make babies
with their mother?

155
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,069
Or with each other?

156
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,738
Your mouth is hopin'
for a soapin', boy.

157
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:49,492

and go kill your brother!

you hurl the other team's
mascot to the ground

161

into his neck.

00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,782
(cell phone ringing)

185
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,617
Yello.

186
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,494
Homer, this is LeBron James.

187
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,371
The fans love my dunks,
but they hate my dancing.

188
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,499
(crowd booing)

189
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,083
I think I can fit
you in.

190
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,044
Let's see...

191
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,045
Lenny, can I move you

192
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,880
from Wednesday at noon
to Sunday at 6:00?

193
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,298
Homer, you know
that's when I play

194
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,466
with neighborhood dogs.

195
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,092
All right, all right,
I'll work it out.

196
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,178
Aw, you guys are
what it's all about.

197
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,098
Reverend, thanks
for turning the church

198
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,434
into a "He-without-cineplex."

199
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,562
What the...Oh, I get it.

200
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,817
Boys, I just
talked to God.

201
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,569
He's vacuuming Heaven
to get it ready

202
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,279
for when dead people
show up,

203
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,241
and He'd like you both
to render a sacrifice.

204
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,450
I shall sacrifice

205
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,078
my finest grains
and livestock.

206
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,458
(flies buzzing)

207
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,459
Behold,

208
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,753
I have found favor
with the Lord.

209
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,464
So shall my knife
find favor with thy belly!

210
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,217
(grunting)

211
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,219
(laughing maniacally)

212
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,732
(groans)

213
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,609
Now I must bury my son,

214
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,112
while you wander
the earth forever

215
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,990
with the mark of evil
upon your face.

216
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,117
(viewers gasping)

217
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,538
(cheering)

218
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,418
(groans)

219
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,169
Ned, your film
was a masterpiece.

220
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,588
It turned me
from an atheist

221
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,631
to a hurray-theist!

222
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,467
Sir, you have revealed
to me a world of faith,

223
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,428
beyond the world of science.

224
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,889
I would pay to see it again
and again and again and again,

225
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,475
but not six times.

226
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,561
I also would pay
to see it again.

227
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:04,395
Me, too.

228
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,563
Here's some guy's wallet.

229
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,565
I am that guy!

230
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,066
Smithers,
we could make a fortune

231
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,443
with these Bible pictures.

232
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,819
And I've been looking
for a way to launder

233
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,614
the money I made selling
club soda as flu vaccine.

234
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,826
Everyone seemed so happy,
but I'm surprised at Ned.

235
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,162
He left out all the good times
Cain and Abel had

236
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,538
when they were growing up.

237
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,081
He's just being true
to the Bible,

238
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,291
which is pretty violent.

239
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,542
And sexy.

240
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,210
King David stole
someone else's wife,

241
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,670
Mary Magdalene was a hooker...

242
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,756
Bart. How do you know
these things?

243
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,757
It's all in this book.

244
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,717
(chuckling)

245
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,344
(groans)

246
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,055
HOMER: Welcome
to the Homer Simpson
Showboating Academy.

247
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,224
Today we're working
on poor sportsmanship.

248
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,936
First, I want you to hurl a ball
at the nearest authority figure.

249
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,939
Nicely done.

250
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:49,940
Oh, my God!

251
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,942
It's my hero, Michelle Kwan!

252
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,362
You remind me
of a young Dorothy Hamill.

253
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,196
(gasps)

254
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,406
I didn't know you could talk!

255
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,368
Lisa, could you pass
the salad?

256
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,203
And it's James with the steal!

257
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,123
(glass shattering)

258
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,500
(groans)

259
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,210
Who wants to help me
clear the table?

260
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,004
(speaking Chinese)

261
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,005
Wait a second.

262
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,257
I've read that you speak
excellent English.

263
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,010
Shut up, kid.
I got a good thing
going here.

264
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,847
Oh, my.

265
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:22,932
Ned's next movie seems

266
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,060
even bloodier
than the last one.

267
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,812
Now, there's no need
to <i>actually </i>whip him.

268
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,271
We can put
the sound in later.

269
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,273
No!
As your financial backer,

270
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,775
I insist upon reality.

271
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,902
Pharaoh didn't put
the sound in later.

272
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,404
But who'd know
the difference?

273
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,239
The people being whipped!

274
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,741
(shouting)

275
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,660
(grunting)

276
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,956
Hey, Lovejoy,

277
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,624
you could take a lesson
from Flanders--

278
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,252
you know, inject your services
with a little razzle-dazzle.

279
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,087
Oh, I already do,

280
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,297
if by "razzle"
you mean "piety"

281
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,427
and by "dazzle" you mean
"Scriptural accuracy."

282
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,720
What a tool.

283
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,099
I'm richer than you!

284
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,982
Look out, Jonah!
It's a whale!

285
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,778
Jonah, Jonah...

286
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,405
Jonah!

287
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,535
Arr!

288
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,707
The only just solution
is to cut the baby in half.

289
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,461
Wait a minute.

290
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,713
I killed a baby.

291
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,047
I'm a monster!

292
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,926
I can't take any more!

293
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,721
Ned, there's more to the Bible
than blood and gore.

294
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,639
Oh, I-I guess
you'd rather see a film

295
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,141
about a liberal
European wizard school

296
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,728
or the latest sexcapade
of Miss Ashley Judd.

297
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,147
Well, I don't like
<i>this </i>movie,

298
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,232
and I'm going to boycott
your financier,

299
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,692
Mr. Burns.

300
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,818
Oh, really?

301
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,446
And what will you use
instead of nuclear power?

302
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,280
Solar.

303
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,114
Hydroelectric.

304
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,408
A mix of conservation
and wind.

305
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,910
Who told you about those?

306
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,703
A talking tree
in a commercial.

307
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,165
(sighs): Well, I know
when I've been licked.

308
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,333
Sorry, Ned.

309
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,502
This movie will never
be seen again.

310
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,170
Dis-embroider
the crew jackets.

311
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,713
We can still
send them back.

312
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,632
Mm-hmm.

I'm the worst thing

Master,
you are truly a fool.

334
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,377
Homer Simpson, we work

335
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,879
for the Commissioner of
Football,

336
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,463
and he wants to see you.

337
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,923
I want to see him, too.

338
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,758
Maybe he can tell me
how to get this off.

339
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,595
It soaked through
to the other side.

340
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,684
MAN: The commissioner's in here
with all the owners.

341
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,104
Homer,
we think you're fabulous.

342
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,773
Since the players began
your rowdy rump-shaking,

343
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,901
our ratings are up 62%.

344
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,987
Plus, we're making millions
in player fines,

345
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,906
which I'm going to use
to bankroll a musical

346
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,949
about The J. Geils Band!

347
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,451
(cheering)
That's right, J. Geils!

348
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,077
Here's why we called
you in:

349
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,412
we want you to produce

350
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,706
this year's Super Bowl
Halftime Show.

351
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:20,294
Wow. At last, my pathetic
little life has a meaning.

352
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,962
(giggles):
You suckers!

353
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,631
I would've done it for free!

354
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,090
Fine, do it for free.

355
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,134
Damn it!
Well, I'll still do it.

356
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,969
(chuckles): Suckers.

357
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,638
I would've paid you.

358
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,722
Fine, pay us.

359
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,099
Oh, damn it!
Will you take a check?

360
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:34,934
No!

361
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:35,851
Damn it!

362
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,730
Mm-hmm.

363
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,570
<i>MALE ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>The Super Bowl Halftime Show.</i>

364
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,198
<i>From its humble origins</i>

<i>♪ Let's get physical... ♪</i>

372
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,973
Oh, every single Super Bowl
Halftime Show has been great.

373
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,808
Oh, Homie, don't worry.

374
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,018
I'm sure you'll come up
with a great idea.

375
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,688
I don't know.
It's a lot of pressure.

376
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,272
(laughing nervously)

377
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,234
Do many people watch
the Super Bowl?

378
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,944
-Billions!
-Oh.

379
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,821
(strumming)

380
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:29,905
(elephant trumpets)

381
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,534
We're ready for rehearsal,
Mr. Simpson.

382
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,577
So, what do we do?

383
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,537
Uh...

384
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,207
Uh...

385
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,292
Oh, man, I have no idea
what I'm doing.

386
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,630
I wonder if other Super Bowl
producers waited

387
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,590
till 3:00 in the morning
the night before

388
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,509
to plan <i>their </i>halftime shows.

389
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,263
-(tires screeching)
-A church!

390
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,432
Maybe the homeless people
sleeping on the floor

391
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,516
will have some ideas.

392
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,269
Flanders?

393
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,603
Well, I guess you've got

394
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,896
some late night problems,
too.

395
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,398
Yeah.
I made a great film,

396
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,442
but I'm having trouble
getting it out there.

397
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,694
I'm like Michael Moore,
except I'm skinny,

398
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,696
my jeans are washed,
and God loves me.

399
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,824
(sighs): I just wish
I could find some way
to spread my message.

400
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,576
Have you tried checking
the oil filter?

401
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,036
Are you even
listening to me?!

402
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,955
Sure, I'd be happy
to tell you my problem.

403
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,957
I've got a venue
the whole world will be
watching,

404
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,542
and nothing to fill it with.

405
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,418
Wait a minute.

406
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,795
You've got a medium,
and I've got a message.

407
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,089
Maybe God brought us together
for a reason.

408
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:34,136
Yeah. You help me, and I,
in turn, am helped by you.

409
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,346
<i>ANNOUNCER: And so,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

410
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:41,018
<i>we have come to the start</i>
<i>of Super Bowl XXXIX!</i>

411
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,645
<i>This brand-new $300 million</i>
<i>stadium was completed</i>

412
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,314
<i>just one short week ago,</i>

413
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,566
and it's scheduled
for demolition
early next month.

414
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,193
America's priorities
are a joke.

415
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,153
Now, here's the kickoff!

416
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:55,032
Wow, all these people
are going to see Dad's show.

417
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,284
Oh, I paid a thousand dollars
for this seat,

418
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,410
and I can't even
see the game!

419
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,954
Just poke through.

420
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,960
<i>ANNOUNCER: And that's the gun.</i>

421
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:11,381
<i>We head into halftime with</i>
<i>the thrilling score of 55 to 6.</i>

422
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,508
But don't stop watching.

423
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,301
In the second half,
points count double.

424
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:18,055
And now the eagerly
awaited Super Bowl
Halftime Show sponsored

425
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,517
by the new Ford pickups,
Citibank and Moe's Tavern.

426
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,935
How could you afford this?

427
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,478
I hustled a lot of pool.

428
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,230
Uh, hey,
you want to play?

429
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,857
I got to warn you,
I ain't that good.

430
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,401
-(chuckles)
-All right...

431
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,112
Sucker.

432
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,238
(groans)

433
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,614
Who's the sucker now,
huh?

434
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,661
Time for Homer's
halftime show.

435
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,037
Get ready, Frank.

436
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,415
Frank went to the men's room.
I'm Joe.

437
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,251
<i>HOMER (over P.A.):</i>
<i>We now take you back</i>

438
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,087
<i>through the ages</i>
<i>to a time before TV,</i>

439
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,632
<i>before cowboys,</i>
<i>before dinosaurs:</i>

440
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,592
<i>the time of the Bible.</i>

441
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,513
<i>The children of God once lived</i>

442
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,640
according to their
Father's laws,

443
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,643
<i>but then a shadow of wickedness</i>
<i>fell across the land,</i>

444
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:08,480
<i>as represented by this cloud</i>
<i>of white pesticide.</i>

445
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,858
(coughing)

446
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,485
But there was one
righteous man:

447
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,070
Noah.

448
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:20,159
O, mighty God, send a flood
to destroy this wickedness!

449
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,501
Hey, do you guys think
Homer's mad at me?

450
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,961
I waved at him
in the parking lot,

451
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,254
and he stared
right through me.

452
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,882
I left the People's Republic
for this?

453
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,967
Yo, Michelle,
you got a boyfriend?

454
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,302
Not in here, I don't.

455
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,764
After 40 days and 40 nights,
the rains stopped,

456
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,893
and Noah sent forth
a single dove...

457
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,813
(whimpering)

458
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,152
(barks)

459
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:00,365
"So God blessed Noah
and his sons and said to them,

460
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,660
'Never again shall there be
a flood to destroy the Earth.

461
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:07,331
I set My rainbow in the cloud,
and it shall be a sign

462
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,751
of the covenant
between God and man.'"

463
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,752
Thank you.

464
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,968
(booing)

465
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,265
All over America today,
viewers were outraged

466
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,935
by the Super Bowl
Halftime Show's blatant display

467
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,311
of religion and decency.

468
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,772
You try to raise your kids
as secular humanists,

469
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:34,107
but these showbiz types
keep shoving religion

470
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,234
down our throats!

471
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,903
Mommy, why wasn't
I baptized?

472
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,738
You see? You see?

473
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,282
I thought America
was hungry for meaning.

474
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,910
I should've just sent
a crocodile into space

475
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,578
like I originally planned.

476
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,330
(groans)

477
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,415
Homie,
I think you did great,

478
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,584
and to celebrate,
I made omelets

479
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,753
from the eggs people
threw at our house.

480
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,339
Dig in, everybody.

481
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,757
Omelets for dinner?

482
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,259
This is the best day
of my life.

483
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,593
Really?
Didn't you just sign

484
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,512
a $90 million contract?

485
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,972
That was a good day, too.
