00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,301
D'oh!

00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,469

00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,182
-Huh?
-(groaning)

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,322
Check it out, girls:

8
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:34,909
68 squares of
ankle-busting fury.

9
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,538
That's right, a double-dogleg,
hamstring-knotting

10
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,582
Hop-Way to Hell.

11
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:44,461
What insane kangaroo dreamed
this fevered nightmare?

12
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,254
Behold.

13
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,717
Ladies, grab your pebbles.

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,635
Mmm!

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,012
(giggles)

16
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,930
-What?
-Nothing.

17
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,184
(laughter)

18
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,394
(with singsong voice):

19
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:03,313
Lisa has a big butt.

20
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,229
ALL:

21
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,023
Shut up! I do not!

22
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,233
Oh no. Don't make
Lisa mad.

23
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,820
She might crush us all
with her giant butt.

24
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:11,821
Shut up, you.

25
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,074
Stop teasing
the big-bottomed lass.

26
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:18,828
She's just as God made her--
plump as a Christmas goose.

27
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,748
LISA: Dad...
the kids at school
said my butt's big.

28
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,416
That's ridiculous, honey.

29
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,835
You're the cutest
little girl I know.

30
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,253
You just have
what is known

31
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,089
as the Simpson butt.

32
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,341
Permit me to elaborate.

33
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,885
Every Simpson starts
with a circle.

34
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,679
Daddy has one big circle
here...

35
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,807
...then a smaller one up
here...

36
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,560
two big, sexy circles
for eyes...

37
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,687
one macho muzzle...

38
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,648
then a snappy new outfit.

39
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,274
Ooh, I'm looking good.

40
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,194
Ooh, cuffs. Yeah.

41
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,030
And for some reason,
my hair and ear

42
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,949
form an "M" and a "G".

43
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,286
Party! Party!
Party! Party!

44
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,162
Hmm?

45
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,664
You want to know
a little trick?

46
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:06,751
To downsize my derriere,
I just tie a sweater around it.

47
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,795
See?

48
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,046
(whimpering)

49
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,714
(falsetto voice):
Oh, Homer,

50
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,925
you're wasting
away to nothing.

51
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,511
You simply must eat something.

52
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,179
(normal voice):
Well, you're the boss.

53
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,393
(falsetto voice):
Oh, I love to see my man eat.

54
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,187
Check it out, Homes.

55
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,481
You said if I ever got
a hundred on a test,

56
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,483
You'd throw me a party.

57
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,153
There's my hundred--
Where's my party?

58
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,446
(scoffs)

59
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,489
Nice try, loser.

60
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,283
I bet you made up
a fake test.

61
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,827
Nope, it's real--
check out the watermark.

62
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,162
All right.

63
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,247
D'oh!

64
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,169
Aha. Here's a mistake.

65
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,213
It says the capital
of Kentucky is Frankfort.

66
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,590
(chuckles)

67
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,924
Dream on, pal.

68
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,802
Homer, the capital of Kentucky
is Frankfort.

69
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,179
Really?

70
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,263
Frankfurter...

71
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,806
is that anything?

72
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,724
(sighs)

73
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,684
Yes, it's something, dear.

74
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:05,727
See, it's all legit.

75
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,061
Now make with the party.

76
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,189
All right, boy, which con
did you work here?

77
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,231
Copy off another kid?

78
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,733
Pay attention and take notes?

79
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,402
Well, take note of this.

80
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,528
(grunting)

81
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,322
(laughing)

82
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,531
(gagging)

83
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,366
(laughing)

84
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,535
Bart really did
get a hundred.

85
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,915
I gave a test on state
capitals, but I forgot to roll
up the map.

86
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,541
Everyone got a hundred.

87
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,461
I win. P-A-R-T. Par-tee.

88
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,921
(party horn squealing)

89
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,048
People, please.

90
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,174
It's a school night.

91
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,675
I thought
you two broke up.

92
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,010
This means nothing.

93
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,679
Yes, yes, you've
made that quite clear.

94
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,391
Maybe a different outfit would
make me look thinner.

95
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,309
Hmm.

96
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,277
(groans)

97
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,239
This store makes me feel
even worse about myself.

98
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,531
(electronic beat)

99
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,251
Oh.

100
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,711
I heard she's back
to her birth weight.

101
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:14,796
Must be nice.

102
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,130
Ew.

103
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,426
No, no, the body on this
mannequin is all wrong.

104
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,762
I know.
It's such an unrealistic

105
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,639
standard for young... huh?

106
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,057
(singing to the tune of
"Bringing in the Sheaves"):

107
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,768
♪ Planing down the thighs,
planing down the thighs ♪

108
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,146
♪ I make four bucks an hour

109
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,277
Hey, I don't look so bad.

110
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,613
Don't worry, Lisa.

111
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,616
You can still find
someone to love you.

112
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,077
Now you've got no choice.

113
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,912
No!

114
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,124
Oh boy, Barty's gonna party.

115
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,292
He sure is--

116
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,044
if he can keep up with
these party animals:

117
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:59,215
Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma,
Grandma Bouvier and...

118
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,134
(imitating fanfare)

119
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,677
Grampa.

120
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,846
(snoring)

121
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:08,349
Plus your school-yard chums:
Martin and Ralph.

122
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,852
Bart's my bestest
boyfriend.

123
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,855
Oh Mom, this
guest list sucks.

124
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,899
It's the best I could do
on such short notice.

125
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,735
Aw, where's Milhouse?

126
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,153
He's got the measles.

127
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,363
But we've got him on
speakerphone.

128
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,990

129

130
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,077

132
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,998
Oh, I told him
to use a land line.

133
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,002
Okay, gang, let's get
this party started--

134
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,714
or should I say Barted? Huh?

135
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,302
For our first game,

136
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,889
I need everyone to draw a
picture of President
Eisenhower.

137
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,976
I drew him with
Canadian Prime Minister

138
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,144
Louis St. Laurent.

139
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,229
Their relationship was
frosty at best.

140

She'll save the party.

Honey, sit down.

155
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,107
Have a big slice of cake.

156
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,317
What? I'm not
fat enough already?

157
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,403

Bart didn't like
his presents. So what?

170
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,735
It's not like he gives <i>us</i>
such great gifts.

171
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,946
Remember that maple leaf
ironed between

172
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,322
the sheets of wax paper?

173
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,532

174
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,700

Oh, it's not
just the presents.

176
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,496
The kids don't
appreciate me anymore.

177
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,206
They'd rather hang out
with their friends

178
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,291
than with their mom.

179
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,584
So they're growing up.

180
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,461
Soon they'll be
leaving the nest,

181
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,504
and you'll have time
for yourself--

182
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,716
hundreds
of thousands of hours,

183
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,385
and then,
the peace of the grave.

184
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,137
No! No, I've got

185
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,098
a lot more mothering
left in me.

186
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,559
I'll be right here at
3:00 to pick you up.

187
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,186
Then I'll take
you to the zoo.

188
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,355
We can eat fries
out of a safari hat!

189
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,608
No, thanks. I'm going
to stay in the library

190
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,817
and do a little reading.

191
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,986
Oh!

192
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,489
Well, I guess it's
just you and me, Bart!

193
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,074
Mom, after that
lame party you threw,

194
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,993
I'd rather hang out
with thunder-thighs here.

195
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,912
(groans)

196
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,998
They grow up so fast.

197
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,125
They're just asserting
their independence.

198
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,503
If a child doesn't do it now,
it may never happen.

199
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,339
Seymour! Do you want your
vitamin in applesauce?

200
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,674
Or are you gonna take it
like a big boy?

201
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,717
Applesauce.

202
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,179
(Maggie giggles)

203
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,058
Oh, sure, you love
me now, but you'll turn.

204
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,060
(grunting)

205
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,311
Stop struggling,

206
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,855
and get in my mouth, jerks!

207
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,399
Aren't you the boy
who beats up my son?

208
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,359
Prob'ly.

209
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,443
What's your name?

210
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,444
Simpson.

211
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,072
Oh, yeah. Bart Simpson.

212
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,242
Spiky hair, soft kidneys,
always hitting himself?

213
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,454
Those tadpoles
are your lunch?

214
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,456
Technically, brunch.

215
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,874
Well, here, take this.

216
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,545
My daughter didn't want
the lunch <i>I </i>made.

217
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,797
(sniffing)

218
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,138
Mmm. This sandwich rocks.

219
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,100
My tadpoles seem crude
by comparison.

220
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,068
Ha-ha! You're
nocturnal.

221
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,071
You don't have to impress me
by making fun of others.

222
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,948
I already like you.

223
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,241
Ha-ha.

224
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,619
I'm starting to let
down my guard. Ha-ha!

225
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,749
Thanks, Mrs. S.

226
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,085
Today didn't
totally suck nard.

227
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,296
It's nice to be
appreciated.

228
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,798
Whatever.

229
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,133
Take it sleazy.

230
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,223
Mom?!

231
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,184
Nelson? I thought you

232
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,061
were sleeping
in the park tonight.

233
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,647
Oh, that's okay,
the kid don't
bother me none.

234
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,648
Hey, Nelson,

235
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,941
say hello to Moe.

236
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,902
He said he'd
take you camping sometime.

237
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,112
I said I might.

238
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,573
MARGE:
Hey, kids,

239
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:16,949
I just heard they canceled

240
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,035
league night down
at the bowling alley.

241
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,453
You know what that means?

242
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,455
Open lanes!

243
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,667
Whaddya say?

244
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,252
It'll be BLAM!

245
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:32,423
Bart, Lisa And Mom. Huh?

246
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,175
Mom, when I want
lame and needy,

247
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,343
I'll call Milhouse.

248
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,344
No offense.

249
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,428
Fine!

250
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,097
I'll take
my mothering elsewhere.

251
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,685
Yeah!

252
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,646
Ooh, great
roll, Nelson.

253
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,732
Here, I cut up your
hot dog for you.

254
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,987
Wow, hot dogs are awesome!

255
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,781
You've never had one before?

256
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,075
No, but I saw some
in a catalog once.

257
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,286
People in sweaters
were eating them at a picnic.

258
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,757
So, my mom works at Hooters,
but her dream is to go

259
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,551
to Vegas and work
in a real strip club.

260
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,387
(growls)

261
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,139
And, uh, where's
your dad in all this?

262
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,849
He went out for a pack
of cigarettes

263
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:24,850
and never came back.

264
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,727
He said "smell ya later,"

265
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,021
but he never smelled me again.

266
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,314
(sobbing)

267
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,818
Nelson, how'd you like
to earn some extra money

268
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,152
around our house?

269
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,697
I have some odd jobs
my kids won't do.

270
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,156
Yeah.

271
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,950
I get the feeling
Bart isn't

272
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,953
everything he could be
in the son department.

273
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,497
Sometimes I think
he's more interested

274
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,375
in his "Itchy and Mitchy"
cartoons than me.

275
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,836
Hey, I'm sure
it's just a phase,

276
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,754
like when I used
to stand on the overpass

277
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,423
and drop computers
on the freeway.

278
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:59,260
Uh-huh. That's how
we got our Kaypro.

279
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,095
64, 65, 66...

280
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,722
Hey, Lisa.

281
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,390
Are you counting
how many days

282
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,267
it takes to wash
your big butt?

283
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,269
(giggling)

284
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,271
I can't hear you.

285
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,648
That's because your
butt blocks your ears.

286
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,316
That doesn't make any sense.

287
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,235
Neither does
your butt.

288
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,236
(giggling)

289
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,988
(growls)

290
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,574
LISA:
I know this obsession
with thinness

291
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,076
is unhealthy and
anti-feminist...

292
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,079
but that's what a
fat girl would say.

293
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,080
Lis, look!

294
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,331
(gasps)

295
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,466
Now, I <i>know </i>there's
a handsome young man

296
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,259
behind all that
hair and dirt.

297
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,598
Hmm. Maybe not,

298
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,184
but you did a great
job on the lawn.

299
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,437
Thanks, Dingus...
I mean, ma'am.

300
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,439
My mother...

301
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,440
my bully...

302
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,816
my God!

303
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,984
MARGE:
<i>Lisa,</i>

304
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,736
just take a bite.

305
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,572
One bite-- that's all I ask!

306
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,866
(groans)

307
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,748
Now, I can't have
toothpaste tonight.

308
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:11,957
Oh...

309
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,460
(doorbell ringing)

310
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,838
Here's the money
you gave my son.

311
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,341
We don't want
your charity.

312
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,718
I didn't give
your son charity.

313
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,054
I gave him self-respect.

314
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,348
Self-respect, huh?

315
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,351
No wonder he came home with
his vest all buttoned--

316
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,353
like he was <i>somebody.</i>

317
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,357
Go home to your son,
Mrs. Muntz,

318
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,652
and try not to have
intercourse on the way!

319
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,494
(cat hisses, screeches)

320
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,047
Nelson, what are you
doing out this late?

321
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,674
My mom ditched me!

322
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,051
She went to Hollywood
to be an actress,

323
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,054
but her range is limited!

324
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,306
(sobbing)

325
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,767
Oh, she's still your mother.

326
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,227
Come inside.

327
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:16,814
Huh?

328
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,066
Can I get you
a glass of milk?

329
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,527
Cow milk?!

330
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,778
Uh-huh.

331
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,159
(surprised yell)

332
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,203
What are <i>you </i>doing
in my jammies?

333
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,705
I'm your new roommate.

334
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,873
I call top bunk.

335
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,040
But...

336
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,458
it's a single bed.

337
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,544
I said top bunk!

338
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,383
(sighs)

339
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,763
(humming)

340
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,182
Mom, the reason God
invented dead bolts

341
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,686
is to keep people like
Nelson <i>out </i>of your house.

342
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,271
Bart, have you ever eaten

343
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,772
a Tootsie Pop?

344
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,650
You know, there's
a tough, crunchy shell,

345
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,568
but if you lick it,

346
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:06,822
there's a delicious
sweetness inside.

347
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,116
Be nice to Nelson,
and I'll give you a Tootsie Pop.

348
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,829
Morning, losers.

349
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,456
Mrs. Simpson.

350
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,417
Pancakes,
my favorite!

351
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,668
Mm... mm...

352
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,837
Bart, eat up or you'll
be late for school.

353
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,172
I'm not hungry.

354
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,967
-Ugh!
-You heard the lady,
clean your plate!

355
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,218
(gulping)

356
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,595
Savor it.

357
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,890
Let the flavors dance
on your palate.

358
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,267
Mm...

359
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,728
Mm... mm...

360
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,980

00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,485
<i>who's dropping by</i>
<i>to see George Lopez?</i>

363
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,570
<i>We pray it's you!</i>

364
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,613
Open.

365
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,866
Nelson, doesn't that
hurt your teeth?

366
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,868
(grunts):
My teeth hurt all the time.

367
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,870
I just try to think
about motorcycles.

368
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,081
I don't like
the sound of that.

369
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,875
Tomorrow I'm taking you
to Dr. Shapiro.

370
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,502
A doctor
for your teeth?

371
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,296
What's next, a lawyer
for your hair?

372
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,547
(stifled chuckle)

373
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,009
(owl hooting)

374
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,719
(creaking)

375
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:16,475

(cries)

384
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,176
I gotta do something
about him.

385
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,553
-(refrigerator door opens)
-Huh?

386
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,686
This is the perfect test.

387
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,981
If I can have one dab
of frosting and then stop,

388
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,358
I'll know I've conquered
food at last.

389
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,659
That was too easy.

390
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,624
(crazed giggling)

391
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:30,424
Okay, if I stop here,
I still have <i>some </i>dignity.

392
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:34,011
(crazed cackling)

393
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,097
Well, at least she's
not singing Streisand.

394
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,892
(cackling)

395
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,439
Hey Lis, still insecure
about your body?

396
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,440
(clears throat)

397
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,776
Yeah, a little.

398
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,487
Those mean girls
just get to me.

399
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,988
I understand.

400
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,199
I have a sister--
I think she's dead now--

401
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,076
who had the same problem.

402
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,786
And I know just the solution.

403
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,001
Sherri. Terri.

404
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,003
The only thing sweeter
than you two

405
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,255
are these stolen cookies.

406
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,465
Enjoy.

407
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,466
(giggling)

408
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,176
Thank you, Nelson.

409
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,345
(screaming)

410
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,596
(laughs)

411
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,890

♪ Sherri smells, Terri smells ♪

412
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,392

416
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,235
Thank you, Nelson.

417
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,530
He who haw haws last,
haw haws best.

418
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,824
I really appreciate
you teaching

419
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,659
those mean girls a lesson.

420
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,453
Tomorrow I can
bleach a swear word
into their hair.

421
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,704
I'd like that.

422
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,043
Nelson?

423
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,545
Papa!

424
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,130
You came back!

425
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,091
(sobbing)

426
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,009
I never meant
to leave you, Nelson.

427
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,095
But something awful happened
when I went to the store.

428
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,721
Well, that
explains a lot.

429
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,806
-Who's hungry?
-No.

430
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,100
I want to hear what happened
at the store.

431
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,935
Well, I went in
to buy cigarettes...

432
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,104
Could you gift-wrap
them, please?

433
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,105
They're for my son.

434
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,607
<i>I also bought myself</i>
<i>a candy bar,</i>

435
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,484
<i>which, uh, unfortunately</i>
<i>was filled with peanuts,</i>

436
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,696
<i>to which I am allergic.</i>

437
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,700
(mumbling gibberish)

438
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,785
-(bellowing)
-I ran outside

439
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,912
<i>just as the circus was</i>
<i>rolling into town.</i>

440
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,581
(percussion plays)

441
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,167
(babbling)

442
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,964
(laughter)

443
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,427
BART:
<i>And that's where I found him.</i>

444
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,346
I brought him back here
so he could take Nelson away,

445
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,349
and my bruises would heal.

446
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,144
I want to give you
a home again, son.

447
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,353
MRS. MUNTZ:
And so do I.

448
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,229
Mom!

449
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,898
I got an acting job.

450
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,817
From the third director
I slept with.

451
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,945
I play Lady MacBeth.

452
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,488
I don't have
to take my top off,

453
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,449
but I do anyway.

454
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:04,328
Well, I'm glad everything
worked out so well.

455
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,331
Yep. The Muntzes are
back in business.

456
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,584
Yep, the Four
Muntzes.

457
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,585
Eh...

458
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,172
Thanks for finding
my Dad, Bart.

459
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,006
And thanks, lady,

460
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,592
for making me feel
good about myself.

461
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,802
So, now that
you're happy again,

462
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,805
I guess you won't beat me up
at school anymore.

463
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,183
I wish it were
that simple.

464
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,893
I really do.

465
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,732
They're a family again.

466
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,776
And so are we.

467
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:36,902
What happened?

468
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:37,861
(groans)

469
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,781
Sometimes you have
to adopt your son's bully

470
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:45,744
in order to bring your
own family temporarily closer.

471
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,788
And Lisa, what
have you learned?

472
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,498
Nothing.
Like many women,

473
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,917
I still have an unhealthy
obsession with my weight.

474
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,794
But talking
about the problem

475
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,003
is the first
step towards

476
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,380
the solution, right?

477
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,841
I guess.
But there's
a long way to go.

478
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,426
(mutters)

479
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,387
Come on, say something
conclusive.

480
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,390
I'm afraid this is
a very open-ended problem.

481
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,475
<i>HOMER (groans):</i>
<i>Oh, open-ended?!</i>

482
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,893

<i>Oh, come on, Lisa.</i>

483
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,478
