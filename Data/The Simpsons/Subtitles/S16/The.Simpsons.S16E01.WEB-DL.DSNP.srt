that bowling ball

Hey, while you're there, can you
get my Frisbee off the ledge?

Come on, Ned.

57
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,517
Just because you foresaw
Dr. Hibbert's death

58
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,019
doesn't mean you can see
into the future.

59

Naked girl avalanche?

Uh, you die eating
a submarine sandwich.

84
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,596
What kind of bread?

85
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,805
Um, country parmesan.

86
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:43,806
Whoo-hoo!

87
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,185
Mr. Flanders,
why are you moving?

88
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:51,105
'Cause I had a vision of myself
shooting your father.

89
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,857
In this neighborhood,
who hasn't?

90
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,609
Well, you can't
fight fate,

91
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,569
but if you must shoot
our father,

92
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,404
please remember
our family motto:

93
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,739
"Not in the face."

94
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,074
Don't worry, sweetie.

95
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,076
I am not going to kill
your father.

96
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,079
Flanders? Kill me?

97
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,747
(laughing)

98
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,082
You never
killed anybody,

99
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,543
and you're going to start
with the big dog?

100
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,255
Homer, please,
don't tempt the gods.

101
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,423
I-I mean God.
There's-there's one God!

102
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,343
Only one!
Well, sometimes there's three.

103
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,886
Hey, Chief,
throw me your piece.

104
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,055
Uh, sure thing, citizen.

105
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,642
Come on. Shoot me a new one.

106
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,144
Ooh, I'm so scared!

107
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,147
Ned Flanders is pointing
a gun at me.

108
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,149
You couldn't even shoot me
by accident,

109
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,152
even if I whacked the barrel
like this.

110
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,240
Quit whacking my barrel!

111
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,992
Never!

112
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,494

114
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,960

115
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,878

I changed the future!

00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,346

He's going to blow up
the whole town!

129
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,162

the core destruct button!

00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,677

Press... destruct button.

134

Don't do it! Don't do it!
You'll kill everyone!

Do it... do it!

00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,063
Kill everyone!

137
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,483
Sure is taking me a long time
to reach this button.

I'll bet you blew up
the town

149

of cleaning the garage.

00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,921
(gasps):
What's this?

183
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,256
A doorknob. Good show.

184
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,634
So, what clues
has the body shewn?

185
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,636
We don't need clues.

186
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,471
We've already
caught the killer.

187
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,015
Oh, eh, please?

188
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,184
This mysterious Hindu

189
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,311
is clearly responsible
for the murder.

190
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,272
Lock him up till we find
someone darker, boys.

191
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,482
Please, I am not a killer.

192
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:48,069
I am but a humble purveyor
of disgusting British food.

193
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,239
Lark tongues, head pudding,
eel pies.

194
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,406
Eel pie?

195
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,741
My favorite.

196
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,076
Mmm... (laughs)

197
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,286
We British
sure eat crap.

198
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,707
Inspector,
might I have a word wit' you?

199
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,584
Absolutely.

200
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,961
(gagging)

201
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,420
-Get back down there, you.
-(eel squeaks)

202
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,588
(grunting)

203
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,131
(gulping)

204
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,091
You were saying?

205
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,842
Well, it's like this.

206
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,345
I'm a proper Cockney
flower girl, I am,

207
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,556
and I sees this
real strange bloke.

208
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,099
Out of sorts.
Mad in the eyes.

209
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,600
-All kettles and biscuits.
-Right.

210
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,769
-Well, he seen I was
lookin' at him,
-Mm-hmm.

211
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,187
and he drops this and runs.

212
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,064
Cor, blimey, skip to me loo.

213
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,691
Good Lord.

214
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:30,695
I'm afraid this case is beyond
even your powers, little girl.

215
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,780
I'll take that challenge,
Inspector.

216
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,323
Yeah, well, good luck.

217
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,284
Uh, now, boys,
let's see the suspect

218
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,994
in that child abduction case.

219
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,829
I shall never grow up.

220
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,622
Uh, in jail you will.

221
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,500
Yes, I recognize this blade.

222
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,586
I sold it as part of a set--

223
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,671
the famed
Seven Swords of Osiris.

224
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,091
Now would you be interested
in an illustrated novelette?

225
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,386
It also includes a "Young
David Diligent" adventure.

226
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,679
Confound it, man!

227
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,890
I need to know
who bought those swords!

228
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,017
Very well.

229
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,768
I will check my records.

230
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,022
You may examine my curios,
but do not touch my oddities.

231
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,025
Use your judgment
with my gewgaws.

232
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,735
Well, I'll be blazed.

233
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,987
I know these missionaries.

234
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,990
I just told the natives they
were having sex the wrong way.

235
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:16,991
Help! Help!

236
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,784
Murther!

237
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,581
The Muttonchop Murderer
is long gone.

238
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,709
But this ledger
will lead us to him.

239
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,044
(groans)

240
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,463
This potion
will give me new life.

241
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,922
(straining)

242
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,593
I'm alive.

243
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,136
I'm gonna go to America.

244
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,263
I'll be in pictures.
You'll see.

245
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,933
The whole world is gonna know
the name Simon Stoolowitz.

246
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,444
It says here
the swords were sold

247
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,237
to C. Ebenezer Burns.

248
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,073
Burns?
The evil industrialist

249
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,034
who makes coal
out of babies?

250
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,370
I know just
where to find him.

251
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,044
Ebenezer Burns?

252
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,921
Yeah, he's over here.

253
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,923
How ya doin', there?
Fresh'n your pipe?

254
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,424
Anybody need a let-me-down?

255
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,926
Whoa, whoa,
heads up there, buddy.

256
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,011
A rat's gnawin' off your toe.

257
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,309
The Sword of Osiris.

258
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,104
I once possessed
the entire collection.

259
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,814
Then I sold them
all for opium.

260
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,649
Oh, how I wish
I had them back...

261
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,942
to sell for more opium.

262
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,069
Who did you sell
the swords to?

263
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,946
A fat man
with sideburns...

264
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,115
like that one over there.

265
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,367
(gasps)

266
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,952
There's
your Muttonchop Murderer!

267
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,203
Stop, fiend!

268
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,043
(grunting)

269
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,048
Opium rules.

270
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,341
Hey, hey.

271
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,218
Read the sign.

272
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,012
Well, well,
what have we here?

273
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,390
Inspector, you've
caught the villain!

274
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,475
But what are you doing
in an opium den?

275
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,477
It's the only way I can
get Ralphie to go to sleep.

276
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,147
I can make "opi-ohs."

277
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,445
Well, Dr. Bartley, another
mystery well solved.

278
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,697
Yes, with the murderer
behind bars,

279
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,157
London's working girls

280
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,826
are free to follow
their merry calling.

281
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,911
(both gasping)

282
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,372
Yet another
Sword of Osiris.

283
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,332
But that must mean...

284
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,210
the murderer is still at large.

285
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,212
Ah, he could have killed
this one days ago.

286
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,631
The body is bloated,
and the face is rotten.

287
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,049
(grunts)

288
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,886
It was five minutes ago,
you twit.

289
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,888
(groans)

290
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,391
(sniffing)

291
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,226
Hmm...

292
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,729
(crowd chattering excitedly)

293
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,898
Please spare me.

294
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,775
I'm not a murderer. I'm not.

295
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:59,028
And I've never known
the pleasures of a woman...

296
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,363
or a proper eating apple.

297
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,490
Quiet, you.

298
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,532
(munching)

299
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,700
Yuck.

300
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,077
There's cheese in my eel pie.

301
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,538
This week,
in our Summer Hanging Series,

302
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,915
we're pleased
to present

303
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,541
the Muttonchop
Murderer.

304
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:17,630
At last God-fearing Londoners
are free to walk Whore Alley.

305
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,426
Stay your hand,
Inspector.

306
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,178
That man is innocent.

307
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,971
The murderer's blade
is covered with blood,

308
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,932
but the handle is covered
with something else:

309
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,769
the unmistakable fragrance
of eel pie.

310
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,605
Hey, lots of people
like eel pie.

311
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,107
Yeah? Well, how many of them
have muttonchops?

312
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,984
(crowd gasping)

313
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,569
Why can't you be
more like Eddie?

314
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,404
He never says
a word against me.

315
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,490
That's 'cause
you cut out his tongue.

316
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,616
E's 'ight, 'eef.

317
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,909
Inspector Wiggum,

318
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,411
you were the most famous
member of Scotland Yard.

319
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,247
Why would you do this?

320
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,416
Well, the fact is,
I wanted to come up with a case

321
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,252
even you couldn't solve.

322
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,212
And besides...

323
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,881
so long,
you stupid British twits!

324
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,760
You'll never catch me.

325
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,304
I'm traveling
at the speed of wind.

326
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,305
(laughing)

327
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:14,019
Remember me for my police work
and not the murders!

328
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,647
Well done.

329
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,232
Their fleet is destroyed.

330
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,235
(both laughing)

331
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,323
Daddy,
I had the craziest dream.

332
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:30,619
Ralphie,
you're still in it.

333
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,663
(bird squawking)

334
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,374
Whee!

335
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,671
♪♪

336
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,973
(speaking gibberish)

337
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,017
<i>PLEASANT FEMALE VOICE:</i>

(speaking gibberish
affirmatively)

340
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,481
This comically
large capsule

341
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,358
has lifetime supplies

342
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:05,321
of niacin, thiamin,
and riboflavin-glavin.

343
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,530
(excited murmuring)

344
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,158
(excited giggling)

345
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,748
Prior to ingestion,

346
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,125
the pill must be reduced
by my amazing

347
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,627
new shrink ray.

348
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,920
Pfft. Shrink ray?

349
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,006
Oh, there's always
something else to buy.

350
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,675
First I lower the capsule top,

351
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,676
thusly...

352
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,097
Then I zap the capsule,
"thisly"...

353
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,811
And now, who would like

354
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,688
a lifetime
of perfect health?

355
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,814
I'll take it.

356
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,441
No, no that's now...
well, all right.

357
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,320
(faint sucking noise)

358
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,947
That sounds
like Maggie.

359
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,032
But she's right here...

360
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,367
(shrieks)

361
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,494
Now, now don't worry,
my dear woman.

362
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:57,581
She will be rocked gently
to sleep by the stomach acid.

363
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,791
(shrieks)

364
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,459
(happily giggling)

365
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,627
Hold on, Maggie!

366
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,878
Daddy's coming!

367
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,547
(grunting):
Come on. Get...

368
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,299
I've got her!

369
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,051
Oh, Mag...

370
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,136
No, wait. This is yours.

371
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,596
(gulps)

372
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,057
Your daughter
has 30 minutes
before the acid

373
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,517
dissolves
the capsule.

374
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,477
But we can rescue her

375
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,813
by sending
a miniaturized vessel

376
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,690
through
Mr. Burns' body.

377
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,024
Ooh, stop that!

378
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,026
The felt is slicing
through me like a knife.

379
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,570
Bionauts assemble!

380
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,571
Captain!

381
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,531
Science Officer!

382
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,532
Security!

383
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,033
Marge!

384
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,161
Now, I insist you take off
your shoes when you get inside.

385
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,080
And, uh,
while you're in there,

386
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,124
grab as much cancer
as you can.

387
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,420
Let the commencement
"beginulate"!

388
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,554
(groans)

389
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:59,059
<i>Now, you must enter</i>
<i>the subclavian vein.</i>

390
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,144
Screw you, doc!

391
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,854
I fly from the gut.

392
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,982
Dad, you should
listen to him.

393
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,567
He's a man
of science

394
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,402
and you can barely read.

395
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,820
Bah!

396
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,072
Has science ever kissed a woman
or won the Super Bowl

397
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,575
or put a man on the moon?

398
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,453
This is what I think
of your precious science.

399
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,579
(grunting)

400
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,456
(yelling)

401
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,999
Help me, science!

402
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,841
<i>Your ship is wedged</i>
<i>in Mr. Burns' heart.</i>

403
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,635
<i>And you must dislodge it</i>
<i>from outside.</i>

404
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,055
<i>But watch out for retroviruses.</i>

405
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,432
<i>Oh, boy, are they retro.</i>

406
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,518
<i>It's a fun design by R. Crumb,</i>

407
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,396
<i>who was friends</i>
<i>with Harvey Pekar.</i>

408
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,940
<i>Seriously though,</i>
<i>touch one and you're dead.</i>

409
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,740
Why is my swimsuit so revealing?

410
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,033
Marge, that's
what turns

411
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:59,203
a mediocre voyage
into a fantastic voyage.

412
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,871
(growls)

413
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,122
(grunting)

414
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,373
Maybe this'll help.

415
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,958
Where'd you get that rib?

416
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,794
There's a whole rack
of 'em over there.

417
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,795
I only ate two.

418
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,046
(grunting)

419
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,841
Bart, what are
you doing?

420
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,842
Takin' a whiz.

421
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,885
Stop that!

422
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,429
We're guests
in Mr. Burns.

423
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,806
To get to Maggie
in time,

424
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,016
we'll have to catch a ride
on a nerve impulse--

425
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,061
the body's information
superhighway.

426
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,104
Learning is cool!

427
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,313
(cheering)

428
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,482
And to make sure
we get there super fast,

429
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,068
I'm hitting all the buttons
with my palm.

430
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,236
(grunts)

431
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,531
(siren blaring)

432
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,325
(explosion)

433
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,911
Well, that hurt like hell.

434
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,089
My sweet,
undigested baby!

435
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,757
(happy giggling)

436
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,802
(engine sputtering)

437
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,972
<i>I'm afraid I have</i>
<i>some bad news, uh, Simpsons.</i>

438
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,515
<i>With the baby's extra weight,</i>

439
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,476
<i>you don't have enough power</i>
<i>to make it back,</i>

440
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,230
<i>and one of you must stay</i>
<i>behind to save the rest.</i>

441
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,314
<i>Frink out.</i>

442
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,732
Oh, my God!

443
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,402
This is the worst Halloween
horror we've ever faced.

444
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,196
And white blood cells
are attacking my clothes!

445
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,824
Although I must admit,
they know where to stop.

446
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,284
We'll have
to lighten the ship,

447
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,828
which means one of us
has to stay behind.

448
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,664
Bart... Lisa...

449
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,040
Fine, me.

450
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,333
MARGE:
Don't worry.

451
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,835
We'll be fine!

452
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,379
I'm saying good-bye
to everything I ever loved.

453
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,006
Ooh, a marshmallow!

454
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,802
Boy, when God closes a door,
He opens a window.

455
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,805
(giggles, gobbles)

456
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,518
Mom,

457
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,811
did you have to fly out

458
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:48,896
through all
those boogers?

459
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,232
Cut me some slack.
I'm a widow.

460
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,276
Now, there is still
a slight chance

461
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,529
we could rescue your husband
before he expands.

462
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,115
(groaning)

463
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,870
Uh, make that zero chance.

464
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,580
Frink out.

465
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,541
Dad, would
you like

466
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,001
some of my Snicker-
bar cheesecake?

467
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,253
Oh, I feel full
enough as it is.

468
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,881
I say
when we're full.

469
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,174
You don't wanna
piss off a man

470
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,551
who can kick you in
the crotch from the inside.

471
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:23,180
(groaning)

472
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,598
Oh, I need a mouth hole.

473
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,226
Um... and some
other holes, too.

474
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,353
Cheer up, my chubby
inner child.

475
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,646
I've got a feeling

476
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,148
