Now, before we eat,

00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,621
let's remember
what we're celebrating today--

10
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,874
after many years
of hard work,

11
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:44,002
your father finally
paid off the mortgage.

12
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,713
See you in Hell, document.

13
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,007
ALL: Yay.

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,008
All right, Dad!

15
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,093
Way to build equity!

16
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,845
Now remember
to eat smart, people.

17
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,013
Go for the fancy foods--

18
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,182
don't let 'em fill you up
with that cheap stuff.

19
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,017
A roll, sir?

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,851
Screw you.

21
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:00,935

31
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:31,716
too thin.

32
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,595

(sing-song voice):
You ate meat.

36
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,148
You ate meat.

37
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,026
You ate fruit.
You ate fruit.

Stow it, you two.

41
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,617
Ow!

43
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,288
Stop making a scene!

44
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,416
How rude.

45
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,752
What do I have to do
to enjoy a Sunday brunch

46
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,671
with my secret
other family?

47
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,506
I've never been
so embarrassed.

48
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,715
And the worst part is,

49
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,177
this is brunch,
so you've ruined <i>two </i>meals.

50
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,054
I'll see you
all at "lupper."

51
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,432
Why did I ever have kids?

52
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,727
I could have written
symphonies, or been Shakespeare.

53
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,062
(moans)

54
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:26,896
Here, Homer.

55
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,774
Have a big, frosty mug
of Fuhgetaboutit.

56
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:30,859
(door creaks)

57
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,402
I wouldn't drink that.

58
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,612
From the looks of this place,
it might kill you.

59
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,614
Oh, who are you,
the health inspector?

60
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,824
Yes.

61
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,117
(all screaming)

62
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:41,911
(loud belch)

63
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,454
My God, look at this filth.

64
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,748
I ought to close this
dump down for good.

65
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,542
-Huh?
-Wha...?

66
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,418
But then where would I go

67
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,878
to get away from my wife?

68
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,755
Come here, Moe,
you beautiful, hideous troll.

69
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,716
(both laughing)

70
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,010
Guys, this is Frankie
from the Health Department.

71
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,219
We go way back.

72
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,555
Lenny, you don't have
to hide that rat.

73
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,474
Off you go, little fella.

74
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,767
(squeaking)

75
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,477
When we were kids,
our dads used to get drunk

76
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,272
and make us fight each other.
Huh? Huh?

77
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,857
My pop would buy me a malted

78
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,567
for every tooth of Moe's
I knocked out.

79
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,111
That time you blinded me,
he gave you a bike.

80
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,322
That sure was
a good-soundin' bike...

81
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,323
(laughs)

82
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,824
Well, now to give this place

83
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,868
a "thorough inspection."

84
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,165
(clears throat)

85
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,584
Free from infestation?
Check.

86
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,294
Sanitary utensils?

87
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,128
Check.

88
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,047
Food hygienically stored?

89
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,673
Only one way to find out.

90
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:40,136
(gagging and groaning)

91
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,390
(shudders)

92
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,476
Oh my God, he's dead.

93
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,186
Okay, which one
of you guys parked

94
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,729
in front of the hydrant?

95
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,274
Uh, look, I didn't see
nothin' here, okay?

96
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,108
(nervous chuckle)

97
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,068
Just a bunch of
innocent guys,

98
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,986
sitting around,
none of them dead.

99
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,197
Buy yourselves a nice dinner.

00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,871
Oh.

103
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,041
So, uh, Mr. New Guy,
what do you think?

104
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,001
Is everything...
hunky-dory there?

105
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,169
Mr. Szyslak,
your tavern

106
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,004
is rife with health code
violations.

107
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,257
You gotta be kidding me.
Like what?

108
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,217
For starters,
the body of my predecessor

109
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,343
is still on the floor.

110
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,594
Oh, yeah.

111
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,971
Uh, well, ya see, trash day

112
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,973

so...

114
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,641
Mm-hmm.

115
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,309

116
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,644

toilet on the roof...

118
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,731
I'm shutting you down
till you fix these violations.

119
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,901
Oh, man, I can't afford
to fix all that stuff.

120
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,364

148
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,372
Mr. Simpson,
for a loan this big,

149
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,499
you'll have to put up
your house as collateral.

150
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,625
Put up my house?

151
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,126
But I just paid it off.

152
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,420
What would Marge say?

153
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,798
Do whatever you have to do
to save Moe's.

154
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,591
I love my Homie.

155
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,468
Okay, honey, I'll do it.

157
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,930
Nothing. Nothing.

158
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,559
Thanks, Homer.

159
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,228
No one's ever trusted me
before--

160
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,688
except for that one guy
who shouldn't have.

161
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,273
-That was me.
-Oh, yeah.

162
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,859
Homer, those kookoo-birds
at the bank goofed up

163
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,903
and sent us a mortgage
statement.

164
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:47,490
Marge! How dare you open
a letter addressed
to both of us!

165
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:52,245
M631700000642J?

166
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,081
This is a new loan
tracking number.

167
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,916
You got a new mortgage?

168
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,251
I had to.

169
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,086
Or Moe's would stay
closed forever.

170
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,671
You gave the money to Moe?

171
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,464
How's he going
to pay us back?

172
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,465
Look, look.

173
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,716
I can see you're upset.

174
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,010
If you need me,
I'll be at Moe's.

175
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,764
Well, maybe I'll go
to Moe's, too,
seeing as I'm now part owner.

176
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,433
Marge, you can't go
with me to Moe's.

177
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,684
I mean,
how would you like it

178
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,227
if I came with you
to your mother's?

179
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,228
I would like it.

180
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,147
You never come
to my mother's.

181
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,358
That's because I hate her.

00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,027
Until you pay us back,

184
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,279
you're answering to me.

185
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,156
And there's going
to be big changes.

186
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,366
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
now wait just a minute.

187
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,619
One thing Moe Szyslak
has never had is a partner.

188
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,789
Nor a wife, a friend,
a chum, a casual acquaintance,

189
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,710
a pen pal, a parrot,
a meaningful conversation,

190
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,255
a brief hug or eye contact.

191
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,133
I'm just going to call
the suicide hotline now.

192
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,636
(two electronic tones)

193
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,263
And they've blocked
my number.

194
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,598
Oh, God!

195
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,974
(sobs)

196
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,146
(tires screeching)

197
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:03,900
(relieved sigh)

198
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,859
Just made it!

199
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,195
(whistle blowing)

200
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,738
Quittin' time!

201
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,158
(tires screeching)

202
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,826
(chuckling)

203
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,660
Boy, I can't wait

204
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,997
to get my lips
around an ice cold...

205
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,499
Marge?

206
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,167
I'm here protecting
our investment.

207
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,754
I'd like you to go home
and make dinner for the kids.

208
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,173
But I don't wanna
take care of the kids.

209
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,133
Uh, um...

210
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,676
How many cigars
are they allowed to have?

211
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,261
Bart sleeps in the microwave,
right?

212
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,679
Quit playing dumb.

213
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,140
How many magic beans
should I sell the baby for?

214
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,225
Three?

215
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,684
Duh, der, duh.

216
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,103
That's me, jerk-ass Homer.

217
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,813
Duh, der, duh.

218
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,941
Come on, go home.

219
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,900
(groans)

220
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,819
MARGE: Maybe some cheerier

221
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,365
paint would make this
place less of a dive.

222
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,492
Marge, my customers
don't like themselves.

223
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,869
Therefore, they seek
the darkness.

224
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,914
(moaning)

225
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:03,376
Well... as fabulous
as your regulars are,

226
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:07,171
a remodel might bring in
a higher class of lush.

227
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,923
Look, I like Moe's
the way it is, all right?

228
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,259
And I ain't changin' it
for any dame, skirt,

229
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,177
Susie-Q or face-macer.

230
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,263
I had a feeling
you'd say that,

231
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,099
so I prepared something
that might help you

232
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,809
change your tune.

233
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,979

253

(crashing)

254
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,152
Well, I was thinking more like
drapes and a paint job,

255
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,237
but your idea's good, too.

256
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,488
Thanks.

Pint of ale, my dear?

260
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,042
Well thank you,
Your Honor.

261
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,294
You know,
you're kind of sexy.

262
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:31,005
That's a deliberate
misstatement of fact.

263
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,048
But I'll allow it.

264
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,799

265

267
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,686
Wow, the numbers
are all bumpy-like.

268
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,606
Ha!

269
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,152
So, Mr. Boswell,

270
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,945
what do you think
of the new Moe's?

271
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,322
Marge Simpson
and Moe Szyslak,

272
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,491
here's a mash note
to your bangers--

273
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:02,495
I wish you could
live in me forever.

274
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,038
Thanks, uh, Freakazoid.

275
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,082
I'd just like to say
that there's one person

276
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,334
to whom I really owe
my newfound success--

277
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,002
Marge Simpson.

278
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,420
Thanks, Moe.

279
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,048
Dad, Mom's spending more time
at Moe's than you are.

280
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,675
And they seem
awfully chummy.

281
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,259
Just what are you inferring?

282
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,844
I'm not inferring
anything.

283
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,846
You infer. I imply.

284
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,515
Whew, that's a relief.

285
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,688
Boy, what a night!

286
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,148
Moe showed me how to give
someone the bum's rush.

287
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,149
Here, watch.

288
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,235
Get lost, rummy!

289
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,236
(grunts)

290
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,362
(chuckling)

291
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,407
Ah, yes, Detroit-style.
Very nice.

292
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,035
So, you've been at Moe's
every night this week.

293
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,495
I know, I used to think of Moe

294
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,497
as a scabby,
dead-eyed hunchback,

295
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,625
but now that I've gotten
to know him, we kind of bonded.

296
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,252
Bonded?!

297
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,503
How many times?

298
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,756
Homer, Moe and I are
just work friends.

299
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,843
You and I are...
marriage friends.

300
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,677
Thanks, honey.

301
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,804
My mind is completely at ease.

302
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,810
(phone ringing)

303
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,978
<i>MOE: Hey, it's me.</i>

304
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,980
Moe!
What's up, partner?

305
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,231
Marge, sorry to call you
so late,

306
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,399
but I had a great idea--

307
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,110
put cutesy signs
outside the restrooms

308
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,696
that say "dukes" and "dames"
instead of the ones

309
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,574
we have now that say
"standups" and "sitdowns."

310
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,659
Huh? Tell me honestly--
what do you think?

311
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,078
Ooh, that's a great idea.

312
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,789
Thanks. Wait, are you sure
I'm not interruptin' anything?

313
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,751
Of course not.
I'm in bed with Homer.

00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,086

<i>with the green...</i>

315

Homer?

00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,861
of thoughts and feelings
completely separate from me.

360
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,070
But it's not physical.

361
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,655
So everything's great, right?

362
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,701
Homer, it's time
you learned the sad truth.

363
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,995
Can I learn it
at a happy place?

364
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,500
Moe and Marge are having
an "emotional affair."

365
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,210
Although there's
no physical intimacy,

366
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,795
there's a deep
spiritual connection

367
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,463
that threatens
to destroy your marriage.

368
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,257
What do I do?!

369
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,467
Engage her feelings,
become a friend.

370
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,345
Ooh, get her a <i>Life </i>magazine
from the week she was born.

371
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,930
I'll always treasure mine.

372
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,643
You're absolutely right!

373
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,228
Stop this ride!

374
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,063
(voice cracks):
You're the boss!

375
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,109
(gasping, screaming)

376
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,278
(grunting)

377
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,405
I want to go again,
Daddy!

378
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,406
Daddy?

379
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,909
HOMER: Marge,
my darling!

380
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,076
Thank God you're home!

381
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,162
I've been dying
to hear your feelings!

382
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,581
Oh, I'm too tired
to talk.

383
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,250
Well, <i>I </i>can go all night,
baby.

384
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,502
I could listen to you two,
maybe three times.

385
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,004
Homie, I'm tired.

386
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,798
I have to get up early
to catch my flight.

387
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,301
Catch your flight?

388
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,471
Moe and I are going
to the Tavern
and Restaurant Owners

389
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,514
Convention in Aruba
this weekend.

390
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,058
Don't you ever
listen to me?

391
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,643
I told you ten times.

392
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:36,894
(snoring)

393
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,357
(clock chimes)

394
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,444
Cuckold! Cuckold! Cuckold!

395
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,946
What's a cuckold?

396
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,199
(spy film music plays)

397
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,503
Where's Mom going
with Uncle Moe?

398
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,213
He's only
your emotional uncle!

399
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,547
I'm your real uncle!

400
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,675
Well, if Hollywood movies
have taught us anything,

401
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,844
it's that troubled relationships
can be completely patched up

402
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,596
by a mad dash to the airport.

403
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,847
I'm off!

404
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,307

you working at the bar.

412
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,782
Me, too, Moe.

413
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:35,411

Moe, your upper lip
is trembling.

422
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,888
Oh, I'm just excited
because they're showing

423

an episode of <i>Boy Meets World</i>
on this flight.

424
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,768
Oh no, wait. That's only
on flights from Europe.

425
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,228
We just get
that little plane.

426
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,438

-Hey, wait a minute.

427
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,814
What the hell is that?

428
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,862
Hang on, Marge!
Homie's coming!

429
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,114
I won't let that man
make you happy!

430
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,992
-(siren wailing)
-(groans): Oh!

431
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,120
Simpson, you were going
a hundred in a 25 zone,

432
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,205
and you're not gonna flirt
your way outta this one.

433
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,417
But I have to get to the airport
to save my marriage!

434
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,461
Really?
Well, why didn't you say so?

435
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,962
Let's roll!

436
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,423
You didn't work this hard
to save <i>my </i>marriage.

437
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,133
Again with that.
Wake up, Lou.

438
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,509

of your league.

No. Why do you say that?

Okay, time to chase this pig
into the sty.

Uh, Marge, you deserve a man
who listens to you,

451
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,799
who respects you,
who understands

452
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,550
what a treasure
you really are.

453
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,469
I don't know what to say.

454
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,304
Just say you love me,

455
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,890
Love me like I love you.
Please?

-That sounds like Homer.
-No it isn't.
I don't hear nothin'.

458
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,566
You're crazy.
Get outta here.
Will you marry me?

459

How'd you get in here?

461
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,028
Toilet hole.

462
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,238
Brrr!

463
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,365
-You leave my wife alone!
-You don't deserve her!

464
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,658
You know
nothing about Marge.

465
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,034
What's her favorite food?

466
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,869
Uh... ice?

467
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,996
Wrong! It's buttered noodles.

468
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,123
He's right.

469
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,042
Oh, it's true.
I don't know Marge at all.

470
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,669

Moe, you've won.

477
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,641
I'll see you
at baggage claim.

478
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,684
Hot damn, I won!

479
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,687
Marge, I swear I'll be
the best man you ever had.

480
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,231
It's gonna be all flowers
and back rubs

481
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,275
and "How was your day,
dear?" and...

482
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,902
Moe!
No, I don't love you.

483
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,238
And I'm certainly not going
to leave my husband.

484
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,072
You mean I listened to all

485
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,491
your touchy-feely yip-yap
for nothing?

486
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,034
I'm afraid so.

487
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,995
At least I had a couple
of sips from your Coke

488
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,079
when you went
to the bathroom.

Homie...

491
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,418
Marge,
I just want to say,

492
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,503
if you ever feel like
cheating on Moe,

493
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,838
here's my card.

494
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,508
Homer, I made a vow
on our wedding day

495
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,595
to stay by you,
for better or worse.

496
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,431
And besides, I love you.

You're my Homie-womie-
romie-domie.

498

gargie-margie-
targie-largie.

500
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,192

a bullet here.

(calypso music playing)

502
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,323
Might as well face it,
I'll never find anyone.

503
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,200
Come on tide,
take me with ya.

504
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,952

no more pain.

Ow. Ow! Ow!

506
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,710

to tell you something.

507
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,586
(ripping)

508
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,338
(gasps): Ow!

509
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,382
You showed me you could be
a really sweet guy.

510
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,344
You can make a woman
very happy someday.

511
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,179
Wow. For realsies?

512
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,347
It's true.

513
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,932
You'd be quite a catch...

514
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,808
if you'd just
shower and shave

515
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,810
and stop swearing
under your breath.

516
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,104
Aw, thanks, Marge.

517
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,814
(under breath):
Know-it-all bitch.

518
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,276
Oh, uh, did I mention there was
a mistake at the front desk?

519

(sneaky chuckling)

520
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,154
Really?
Is it one that will change

521
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,906
the sleeping arrangements?

522
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,866
Could be. Could be.

523
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,159
(chuckles)

524
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,787
Listen, I got to tell you,
I chew in my sleep.

525
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,163
Yeah, well,
I sweat blood.

526
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,666
Good night, both of you.

527
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,586

Who's watching the kids?

528

want us to enter
