00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,075
on the floor
and eat bugs.

183
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,743
What countries
are those?

184
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,953
You ever been to Norway?

185
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,455
-No.
-Well, they do
it in Norway,

186
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,957
and that's why
I personally thank God

187
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,750
we pay too much for drugs.

188
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,628
I mean, uh, the right amount.

189
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,713
I mean, not enough.

190
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,423
Here, watch this video.

191
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,759
(new age music)

192
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,553
NARRATOR:
The mighty Amazon River.

193
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,263
The natives had a word for it.

194
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,850
Then we got rid of the natives
and no one remembers that word,

195
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,436
but, here are some words
everyone remembers,

196
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,897
by Huey Lewis and the News.

197
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,566
♪ I want a new drug ♪

198
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,401
♪ One that won't make me sick ♪

199
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,405
♪ One that won't
make me crash my car ♪

200
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,532
♪ Or make me feel
three feet thick ♪

201
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,785
♪ I want a new drug ♪

202
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,497
♪ One that won't
hurt my head... ♪

203
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,833
(men coughing)

204
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,127
All right,
here's your medication.

205
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,212
Wait a minute.

206
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,379
This ain't no pill.

207
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,672
It's a corn nut.

208
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,798
I got a bottle cap.

209
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,050
(buzzing)

210
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,927
Mine flew away.

211
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,596
Let me explain
from behind this cage.

212
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,933
Now, your pills have
become very expensive

213
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,602
and no one gives
a rat's ass about you,

214
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,188
so after a lot of
thought, we decided

215
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,523
to let you go cold turkey.

216
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,233
For those of you
who survive the night,

217
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,609
we'll be having
waffles tomorrow.

218
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,737
Ooh, waffles!

219
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,531
I didn't die
in World War II

220
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:55,034
just to be pushed around by
some pill-hoarding hussy!

221
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,203
I'm gonna fight this thing.

222
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,664
He's crazy, but what
are you gonna do?

223
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,790
He's young.

224
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,750
MARGE:
Well, the drug company

225
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,919
won't do anything
to help us.

226
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,087
I got the answer!

227
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,088
Dad?

228
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,506
Oh, thank God,
it's the right place.

229
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,633
I burst into four
homes before this one.

230
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,760
Now, listen.
All the drugs we want

231
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,595
are right across the border.

232
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,514
I have a friend who'll help us.

233
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,890
The border, eh?

234
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,518
Then I'd better
sand off my fingerprints.

235
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:24,397
(yelling)

236
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,399
I could just wear gloves.

237
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,733
Nah, they're upstairs.

238
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:31,946
(yelling, moaning)

239
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,533
Hola, señor.

240
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,911
We are gringos who wish to spend
mucho dinero in your country.

241
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:39,912
Splendid.

242
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,038
Welcome to Canada.

243
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,123
D'oh!

244
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,379
Okay, Abe, here are your
fake Canadian health cards.

245
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,047
Take them
to any pharmacy

246
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,882
and you'll
get enough drugs

247
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,510
to make Regina
look like Saskatoon.

248
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,720
(all laughing)

249
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,179
That's a good
one, Johnny.

250
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,723
Thanks a million, Johnny.

251
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,058
In appreciation,
I'd like to give you

252
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,728
this DVD player.

253
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,187
What the heck?

254
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,607
Where do you pour the syrup?

255
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,154
I'd like some Vioxx,
Cumadin, Albuterol,

256
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,532
Prevacid and an auto-inflate
blood-pressure-monitor C-cuff,

257
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,825
with case.

258
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,493
Anything you like,
fellow Canadian.

259
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,494
Canadian?!

260
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,163
Them's fightin' words!

261
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,874
I mean, accurate words.

262
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:29,253
♪ One pill makes you larger ♪

263
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,798
♪ And one pill makes you small

264
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:37,803
♪ And the ones
that mother gives you ♪

265
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:42,558
♪ Don't do anything at all ♪

266
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,228
♪ Go ask Alice ♪

267
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,524
♪ When she's ten feet tall ♪

268
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,528
Anything to declare?

269
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,031
I declare
that you have

270
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,116
the most beautiful
brown eyes.

271
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,702
Why I do believe you're
smuggling...

272
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,413
a heart as big as all outdoors.

273
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,166
Now get in my
country, ya big lug.

274
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,294
(sneaky chuckles)

275
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,046
Did he have a passport?

276
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,757
Yes... to my heart.

277
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,468
(singsongy)
Drugs! Various drugs!

278
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,470
Be sure
to read instructions!

279
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,556
Uh-oh! Where'd
I put the instructions?

280
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,683
Now, who's next?

281
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,143
I got pills to make
you sleep late,

282
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,937
coagulate,
eliminate and copulate...

283
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,271
in that order.

284
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,481
Grampa.

285
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,400
We would like to thank you

286
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,485
for all you have
done for us.

287
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:39,615
Please accept this Operation
Dumbo Drop souvenir jacket.

288
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:44,078
Look. They used the same "D"
for "Dumbo" and "Drop."

289
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:48,582
Ha! Unbelievably, only three
were ever purchased.

290
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,085
Marge?

291
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,294
Bart?

292
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,754
Lisa?

293
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,297
(ukulele playing)

294
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,634
Aloha!

295
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,928
Wow, this is
just like Hawaii,

296
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,138
but you don't
get beaten up

297
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,806
if you leave the
hotel. What gives?

298
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,307
We just wanted
to thank you.

299
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,309
Because of the Xanax,
I'm not over-anxious

300
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,853
about being
a Simpson anymore.

301
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,063
I am a little anxious
about being on Xanax,

302
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,857
but the Zoloft
covers that nicely.

303
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,277
My Dad, the drug mule.

304
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,528
(gagging)

305
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,949
Uh. Ew.

306
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,660
Oh, man, I need something
to settle my stomach.

307
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,665
Oh, wait. I was supposed
to take these with food.

308
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,841
Oh, look, it is Mr. Homer,
my favorite customer.

309
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,302
Please-- feel free to
paw through my Playdudes

310
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,428
and tell me to go back

311
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,513
to some country I am
not actually from.

312
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,098
Why the sweet talk, Apu?

313
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,225
Are you after some cheap drugs?

314
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,686
Please let me come on one
of your smuggling runs!

315
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,855
My eight babies
are driving me crazy

316
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,025
with their coughing and sneezing
and general oozing, and...

317
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,819
My Janitor in a Drum
is afraid to come out.

318
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,029
What does that mean?

319
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,113
I don't even know.

320
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,573
That's the kind
of bad joke

321
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,033
I am making,
I am so tired.

322
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,242
Help me out, Homer.

323
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,036
My little Roddy
needs his insulin.

324
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,663
Breaks my heart to watch him
jones-diddly-ownsing.

325
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,831
Flanders?

326
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,124
I don't know.

327
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,709
I mean, you haven't
done anything for me

328
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,836
since you lent me that
5,000 bucks yesterday.

329
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,671
I don't claim to be
the perfect neighbor.

330
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,840
If you let us come,
I will give you

331
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,384
ten minutes alone with
my Squishee machine.

332
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,385
Do what you will.

333
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,386
No cameras?

334
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,598
(sputtering)

335
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,392
No cameras.

336
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,352
Homer,

337
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,396
tell Mr. Ned
to stop trying to convert me!

338
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,233
I was just telling him how brave
he is to worship a false god.

339
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,860
I do not worship one god, okay?

340
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,030
I worship a whole super-team
of deities that...

341
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,783
Ow! Ow! Okay,
he just pinched me!

342
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,701
Well, where's
your super-team now?

343
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,702
Listen, you two,

344
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,163
I'll tell you who
the true God is

345
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,207
if you're both quiet
the rest of the trip!

346
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,500
-But the infinite beauty...
-But the Bible says...

347
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,210
All right,
I'm comin' back there.

348
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,962
APU:
Save me, Shiva!

349
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,171
FLANDERS: Why don't
you just call out for Hawk Man?

350
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,297
APU: Why don't you shut up?

351
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,595
Well circle-cut my bacon!

352
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,597
Look at all these
Yankee-doodly-dandies!

353
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,516
Is there another Vietnam
going on?

354
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,017
Hello, neighborino
to the north.

355
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,978
I sure like the cut
of your gibberish.

356
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,312
Co-indodlie-diddly.
Diddly-oodly

357
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,398
Oodly...
Piccadooddly.
oodly-oodly...

358
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,149
Noodly-daddly-
diddly-daddly.

359
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,067
Diddly-daddly-utner...

360
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,068
Loony-oodly.
Maple-iddly.

361
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,903
Doodly-doddly-diddly,
doddly.

362
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,864
Say, would you like
to puff on a reefer-ino?

363
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,115
It's legal here!

364
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,200
They warned me
Satan would be attractive.

365
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,201
Let's go.

366
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,080
Anyone want some coffee
for the ride back?

367
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,957
It's not that convenience
store crap, is it?

368
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,126
Because I don't feed
that to my dogs.

369
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,627
No, no, it's home-brewed.

370
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,920
Careful, it's hotter

371
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,672
than a Fox News
weather skank.

372
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,509
Ooh, my, hot, hot, hot!

373
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,468
La, la, la, la, la, la, la!

374
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,761
Here, let me wrap
this wet towel

375
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,179
around your head
to cool you off.

376
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:51,974
La-la-la-la-la-la-la!
Ha! Ha!

377
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,017
La-la-la-la! Ha! Ha!

378
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,851
La-la-la-la!

379
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,979
Stop him!
He's expressing
his faith, eh!

380
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,606
(guns cocking)

381
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,233
Hold on.
We're just innocent tourists.

382
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,912
(guns cocking)

383
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,038
La-la-la-la-la-la-la!

384
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,331
I took another sip.

385
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,295
Today, Mounties busted a major
American drug smuggling ring.

386
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,380
Former U.S. astronaut
Homer Simpson

387
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,757
was taken into custody.

388
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,677
Oh, my butt looks so huge
during perp walks.

389
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,347
We've confiscated your car
and its contents.

390
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,848
(translating):
Nous avons confisque

391
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,767
votre voiture
et ses contenus.

392
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,685
You may leave Canada,
but never return.

393
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,063
Vous etes permis de quitter
le Canada,

394
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,690
mais vous n'avez pas
le droit de rentrer.

395
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,067
I am a big fat
French idiot.

396
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,028
Je suis un grand
gros... hey!

397
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,697
(chuckles)

398
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,199
No more drugs.

399
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,575
We let everyone down.

400
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,078
Your jacket, señor.

401
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:57,206
Thank God we did not stitch
your name over the breast.

402
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,999
(sighs)

403
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,542
Dad, you tried your best.

404
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,336
For the first time
in my life

405
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,213
I can say
without being drunk,

406
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,881
that I truly admire you.

407
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,299
BOTH:
Aw...

408
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,178
No drinking in public!

409
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,932
Hey, where'd it go?

410
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:15,766
Oh, well.

411
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:19,019
Ah, there's nothing like
canceling an employee drug plan

412
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,064
to make one feel so at peace
with the universe.

413
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,565
I agree, sir.

414
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,483
Shut up.

415
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,360
I'm so sick of you, Smithers.

416
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,071
Your toadying,
your complete agreeability,

417
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,948
your gasping on the floor...

418
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,241
Wha?!

419
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,243
Smithers, if this
is some sort of hijink,

420
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,411
stop it immediately.

421
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,122
Sir, my thyroid
is swelling up.

422
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,415
Confound it, man!

423
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,959
I need your throat clear
and ready for perjury.

424
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,627
When you canceled the drug plan,

425
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,546
I couldn't afford
my Thyroxin anymore.

426
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,423
But before I die,
there are words

427
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,133
I've always longed to say.

428
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,134
Sir, I...

429
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,804
(choking noises)

430
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,264
Fear not, Smithers.

431
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,225
I'll move Heaven
and Earth to save you!

432
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,601
It's still easier
than teaching

433
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,103
a new assistant
my filing system.

434
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,814
I just wish we could
make one last big score.

435
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,734
But we could never drive
past the border patrol.

436
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,320
There are other ways
to get into Canada...

437
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,036
(screams)

438
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,746
That's it, a plane!

439
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,456
Smuggle drugs
in a plane?

440
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,082
That'll never work!

441
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,711
Sure it will.
All we need is a pilot!

442
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,671
BURNS:
I've got everything you need.

443
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,090
HOMER:
Katharine Hepburn?!

444
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,925
No, you fool.
'Tis I, Burns!

445
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,177
Now come with me.

446
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,307
BURNS: At last,
my plane shall be used
for its original purpose--

447
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,560
to subvert the laws
of the United States.

448
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,648
Looks like your plane's
pretty full, eh?

449
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,941
Don't wanna overload it.

450
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:51,361
(scoffs):
Typical Canadian wimpiness.

451
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,615
That's why you have snowballs
and we have the H-bomb.

452
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,785
We really appreciate
your help, Johnny.

453
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:58,952
Is there any way
we can repay you?

454
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,581
Well, I've always wanted
to see a man

455
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:06,126
with the IQ of a child
executed by the state.

456
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,337
We don't get that
up here.

457
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,421
Really? In America,

458
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,964
we do it four times
a week.

459
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,510
You come on down,
and I'll get us
front row seats.

460
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,095
I'd like that.

461
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,015
We're losing altitude.

462
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,851
Time to dump
all unnecessary weight.

463
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,395
Wha...? Don't dump me out!
I can lose weight!

464
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,980
Just give me a chance.

465
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,191
One... two...

466
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,359
Eh, I'd rather die.

467
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,611
It's no use.

468
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,363
We've got to make
an emergency landing.

469
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,740
Well, at least we're all
in this together.

470
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,742
Now, we have three parachutes.

471
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,119
This one's for me...

472
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,663
And these two are gifts
for my nephews.

473
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,705
Tally ho!

474
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,748
(gasping)

475
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,087
ABE:
Homer, are you sure
you can fly this thing?

476
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,672
We'll make it, Dad.

477
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,465
On a wing and a prayer.

478
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,466
Damn it!

479
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,884
(snoring)

480
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,685
(gasps)

481
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,062
(sirens wailing)

482
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,730
(gun cocks)

483
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,065
All right,
you're under arrest.

484
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,024
On what charge?

485
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,693
Making a police chief go...

486
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,069
(gasps)

487
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,656
Get in the car.

488
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,408
And don't touch those guns.

489
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,659
I just loaded them.

490
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,536
You'll have
to arrest me, too.

491
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,164
Abe Simpson brought
the Propecia

492
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,958
to keep grass on Willie's field.

493
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,169
He cured my lumbago. Thank you.

494
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,378
My diaper rash.

495
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,464
My glayvinoids
are not so hurtful!

496
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,842
Thanks to his lactose-
intolerance pills,

497
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:40,012
I can drink this
Krusty-brand milkshake.

498
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,931
Terrible!

499
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,933
Well, Simpson,
you have helped
a lot of people,

500
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,854
so, like it says
in the Springfield
Police Handbook,

501
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,814
"If you can't beat 'em,
join 'em."

502
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,774
(cheering)

503
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,194
Uh, Chief, you know,
I've been checkin'
the handbook.

504
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,696
A lot of the things you say
aren't in there at all.

505
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,072
Yeah, well, look
a little closer, Lou.

506
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,783
(cheering)

507
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,997
(panting)

508
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,085
Oh, I hope I'm not too late.

509
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,346
Take, potion! Hurry!

510
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,598
Oh, it's not working.

511
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:28,227
Only my sour, curdled breath
will quicken him.

512
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,937
(grunting)

513
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,396
(pleasant groan)

514
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,731
(groans)

515
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,108
(sighs)

516
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,276
Ah!

517
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,654
Sir, you saved my life!

518
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,908
Yes. Smithers, I was
a stingy old fool.

519
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,953
But from now on,
I'll provide drug benefits

520
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,914
to all my full-time employees.

521
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,457
Great news, honey!

522
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,293
Mr. Burns made me
a freelance consultant!

523
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,628
Hey...

524
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,964
what's this lump?

525
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,261
Shh!
