is Mayor and suspected
illegal immigrant Joe Quimby,

37
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,958

Er, uh...

Er, ah, waaah.

Raise this as your own.

illegitimate children

48
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,069
are you hiding?

49
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,739
Kent, I'm hiding nothing...
except this puppy.

50
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,491
Aww...

51
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,703
Look into his eyes
and tell me I'm lying.

52
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,621
Well, I'm placated,

53
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,040
and so are all my friends
in the local media.

54
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,084
I have a question.

55
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,962
Chloe Talbot,
Global News Network.

56
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,131
Oh, it seems
a big shot reporter

57
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,551
from some major news
outlet isn't satisfied.

58
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,554
Well, if it isn't local
news legend Kent Brockman.

59
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,348
Hey, Kent, run over
any more pedestrians?

60
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,725
Those records are sealed.

61
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,352
She's from Springfield.

62
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,770
I knew her in high school.

63
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,565
I didn't think anyone successful
came from Springfield.

64
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,317
What about that
two-headed goat?

65
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,527
Technically, he was born
in Shelbyville.

66
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,821
Yes, but he came here to die.

67
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,242
One of you ate tin cans,
one of you ate health food.

68
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,953
How you solved crimes,
I'll never know.

69
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,041
Mr. Mayor, you claim to be
faithful to your wife,

70
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,960
but I have obtained
this exclusive video tape.

71
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,213

read my sash.

73
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,592
You're the major?

74
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:41,012
That's mayor,
you fertile moron.

75
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:44,557
Two things are certain--
the mayor is in deep trouble,

76
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,769
and the local newsmen
in this town are idiots.

77
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:48,811
<i>Channel Six News </i>rocks.

78
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,813

79
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,774

successful.

82
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,783

too, Mom.

83
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:05,453

94
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,650
Mr. Mayor, will you answer
one question?

95
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,152
Only if it is submitted
in writing.

96
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,990

97
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:42,865

Marge! Oh, where
are you living now?

101
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,208
Evergreen Terrace.

102
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,628

Evergreen Terrace.

104
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,258
The street that
smells like pee.

105
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,676
This is my daughter,

106

Lisa.

107
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,805
Chloe, I really admire
how you got out of Springfield

108
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,682
and became such a success.

109
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,851
Hey, only the lame-os stay.

110
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,644
And your mother.

111
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,687
Super lady.

112
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,314

113
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,399

to see you, Chloe.

114
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,609
Would you like to come over
for dinner tomorrow?

115
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,361
Oh, I'd love to.

116
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,489
I'm getting so sick of
these greasy catered meals.

117
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,534
You insult me,
you insult Italy.

118
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,619

I sawed you
on the television.

122

I remember you
from high school.

123
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,093
You barfed in my tuba.

124
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,138
I believe it was
the school's tuba.

125
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,395
Chloe, these kebabs you made
are as good or better

126
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,439
than anything I've ever had
at this table.

127
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,441
Homer.

128
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,694
Oh, Marge,
I'm just being polite.

129
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:07,742
Hmm.
My back pain's completely cured.

130
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,871
That was one too many.

131
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,749

in Istanbul.

132
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,459

Well...

141
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,938
Oh. We finally found out

142
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,191
why the dog was scooting around
on his butt all day.

143
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,820
Turns out he had an
impacted anal gland.

144
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,243
The excitement
never stops.

145
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,621

00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,912
(imitates atonal melody)

182
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,082
Homer, what are you doing?

183
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,043
I swallowed a chicken bone.

184
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,587
(gagging atonal melody)

185
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,255
(coughs)
Oh...!

186
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,133
Chloe, you've lived so many
fascinating places.

187
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,427
Yes, but down deep in my heart,

188
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,472
I'll always be the girl
who wanted to leave Springfield.

189
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,057
Gee, with all that travel,

190
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,934
you probably haven't
had much time

191
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,519
to find that
special someone.

192
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,187
Oh, I've had a few flings.

193
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,939
(coughs):
Bill Clinton.

194
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,106
(coughs):
Schwarzenegger.

195
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,733
Oh, excuse me.

196
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,653
But not all of us can be
as lucky as you, Marge.

197
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,488
Homer's a wonderful man.

198
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,782
(singing atonal melody)

199
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,784
Did you just swallow
another bone?

200
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,661
Same one.

201
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,496
Chloe is amazing.

202
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,582
Even her serving bowl
smells glamorous.

203
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,167
(sniffs)

204
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,460
That's ridiculous.

205
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,462
No one's bowl smells...

206
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,005
(sniffs)

207
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,550
It's like Christmas in Aspen.

208
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,718
(sighs deeply)

209
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,720
Did you know back
in high school

210
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,514
that she'd be such a star?

211
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,933
Back then,
we were both stars...

212
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,812
in the thrill-a-minute world
of high school journalism.

213
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:28,734
<i>Together we broke the biggest</i>
<i>story of the semester.</i>

214
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,572
<i>One of the cafeteria workers</i>
<i>was spitting in the soup.</i>

215
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,866
I'll teach you to give me
my first job out of prison.

216
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,953
<i>When we published the story,</i>

217
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,998
<i>we received the school's</i>
<i>highest award.</i>

218
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,208
Ladies, it is my great
pleasure to award you

219
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,626
these certificates of merit.

220
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,754
In this box marked "honoree,"
fill in your names.

221
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,756
And over here,
write in what you did.

222
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,882
I'll be back.

223
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,510
You ain't tasted
the last of my spit.

224
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,346
Oh, that Moe.

225
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,889
But good for you, Mom!

226
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,475
Why didn't you follow Chloe
into journalism?

227
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,478
Well, we both faced
a tough decision...

228
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:08,649
<i>...go off to journalism school,</i>
<i>or stay in Springfield</i>

229
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,151
<i>with our sweethearts.</i>

230
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,821
(both cooing, murmuring
and smooching)

231
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,656
Stay with me, Marge,

232
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,242
and I promise
we'll travel the world...

233
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,744
and perhaps outer space.

234
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,370
(imitates flying saucer)

235
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,747
(imitates ray gun)

236
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,875
(imitates science fiction
sound effects)

237
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,336
(guttural moans)

238
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:32,256
(moans and titters)

239
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,050
I love you, Chloe...

240
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,510
and I love you too,
brake fluid.

241
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,556
(belches)

242
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,060
Chloe left town
as soon as Barney proposed.

243
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,812
I would've followed her,
but my plans changed

244
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,608
when God brought me
a wonderful little boy...

245
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,026
Bart, stop that!

246
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,904
This isn't what it looks like.

247
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,573
(muttering softly)

248
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,743
Why would Homer write
his name in grime?

249
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:06,916
(grunts)
Ah, that's better.

250
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,002
Mom, Chloe just won
the Peabody Award!

251
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,673
Well, I just made the bathroom
floor smell like lemons.

252
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,800
Where's the award for that?

253
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,344
Oh, Mom, don't feel bad.

254
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,304
Everybody
appreciates your...

255
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,515
Uh-oh, I'm late
for my dinner...

256
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,933
with Chloe!

257
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,309
(chuckles)

258
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,105
HOMER:
Good news, Marge!

259
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,066
I've learned to walk
naked on stilts!

260
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,818
-(grumbles softly)
-Oh...

261
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:38,781
(gasps)

262
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,908
There's Dan Rather
and Tom Brokaw

263
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,827
hanging out
with Kent Brockman!

264
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,995
You want your mic back,
local anchor?

265
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,540
This just in...
I'm pissed off!

266
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,041
Hi, fellas!

267
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,211
Chloe, wanna
feel my muscle?

268
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,089
Chloe has such
an amazing life.

269
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,007
(sighs)

270
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,926
I wonder what would
have happened

271
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,720
if I'd stuck with journalism.

272
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,597
Oh, honey, her life
can't compare to yours.

273
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,768
You've got three kids,
a TV tray from Expo '67,

274
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,812
and you're married
to King Stink!

275
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,772
Yeah, I guess.

276
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,023
Marge, listen to me.

277
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,775
Chloe may have a flashy job,

278
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,069
but you're the backbone
of this family.

279
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,404
You're like the
electrical tape

280
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,239
that holds the two halves
of my car together.

281
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,491
That's a sweet
thought, Homie.

282
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,493
I just hate to see
you upset, honey.

283
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,789
You know what would be
a good name for Maggie?

284
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,249
Chloe!

285
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,876
Oh!

286
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,211
That was such
an exciting night.

287
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:38,340
Morley Safer
has the biggest head
I've ever seen.

288
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,176
I really had fun.

289
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:44,221
Oh, it's gonna be a let-down
going to school tomorrow.

290
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,224
We have to make
a pilgrim out of felt.

291
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,935
Hey, I'm covering the U.N.
Women's Conference

292
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,812
in Capital City tomorrow.

293
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,147
You want to come with me?

294
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,691
Oh! That'd be wonderful!

295
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,610
Oh, I'd... I'd have
to ask my Mom.

296
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,278
Well, you can
ask her right now.

297
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,363
She's glaring at us
from the front lawn.

298
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,993
Marge, it's my fault
we're a little late.

299
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,953
How dare you
show my daughter

300
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,914
a life of fun
and possibility?

301
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:13,459
Hey!
Keep your dish-washing
hands off the Armani!

302
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,337
For your information,
our electric dishwasher

303
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,173
is on the fritz.

304
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,758
Not that you care

305
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,552
about the ups and downs
of my appliances.

306
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,179
Do ya? Huh, do ya?

307
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,014
Oh! That's it!

308
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,557
I'm going to show you
some moves I learned

309
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,100
from G. Gordon Liddy!

310
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,186
I'm so sick of names!

311
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,689
(both grunting)

312
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,608
(yowling and grunting)

313
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,861
Ladies!

314
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:41,946
(chuckles)

315
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,156
There is no need
to fight over me.

316
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,492
No one's fighting over you!

317
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,327
Oh. Well, then, carry on.

318
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,956
CHLOE: You don't know
when to quit!

319
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,131
"Shiner-Be-Gone."

320
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:10,015
<i>♪ Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral ♪</i>

321
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:15,688
<i>♪ Too-ra-loo-ra-li... ♪</i>

322
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,858
Hmm.

323
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,735
Lisa, honey,

324
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,446
let me explain
what happened tonight.

325
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,158
Sometimes when your mom
has half a glass of wine,

326
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,160
she goes cuckoo bananas.

327
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,161
Hmm.

328
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,496
So is it okay

329
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,623
if I go to the women's
conference with Chloe?

330
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,209
Let me think about it.

331
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,210
No.

332
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,927
(laughs)

333
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,434
I've never disobeyed Mom before.

334
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,562
Is this a step
I'm really willing to take?

335
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,688
I don't know.

336
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,857
The more I think about it...

337
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,400
Thinking is for losers!

338
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,818
Bart!

339
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,904
Thanks for helping me
make up my mind.

340
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,655
Thanks for cushioning my fall.

341
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,573
I didn't cushion your...

342
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,657
(grunts)

343
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,202
Chloe!

344
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,413
I saw your report
on Kuala Lumpur.

345
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,040
Truly hard-hitting.

346
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,834
Thanks, Tom.
I really appreciate that.

347
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,920
So, I, you know,
I was wondering...

348
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,296
Yes?

349
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,673
Would you like to come

350
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,133
to my celebrity
racquetball tournament?

351
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,718
I'll have to check
my schedule.

352
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,969
(grunts)

353
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,095
(Lisa grunts)

354
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,056
I'll give you
a first-round bye.

355
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,223
Gotta go, Tom.

356
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,475
I'll think about it.

357
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,940
Lisa, breakfast!

358
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,316
I know you're mad at me,

359
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,693
but I hope you're not mad
at Cap'n Crunch.

360
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,028
(gasps)

361
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,030
(grunting)

362
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,865
(gasping)

363
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,368
Homer, we've
gotta get Lisa!

364
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,327
All right.

365
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,205
While I'm gone, boy,
you think about what you did.

366
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,873
Ugh. What did I do?

367
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,375
You, uh...

368
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,293
-Why, you little...!
-(grunts)

369
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,879
Need a reason
for strangling, do ya?

370
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,547
I'll fix your wagon!

371
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,841
(grunting)

372
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,178
-(phone rings)
-Hello.

373
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,972
Chloe, forget about
the women's conference!

374
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,598
I need you to get over
to Mount Springfield.

375
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,100
It's about to erupt!

376
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:19,186
Don't we have a reporter
who specializes
in natural disasters?

377
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,772
Yeah, he's busy covering
Julia Roberts' last haircut.

378
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:22,648
(chuckles)

379
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,650
But seriously, he's dead.
Now get going!

380
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,079
Hey, there!

381
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,122
The name's Chet.

382
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,041
I'm your cameraman
for this here 'cano story.

383
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:41,917
Let's see.

384
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,253
I've been to Afghanistan,
Serbia, Lebanon...

385
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,967
Okay, okay, I lied.

386
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,720
I shoot wedding videos
in Dallas-Fort Worth.

387
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,639
Okay, okay.
Just Fort Worth!

388
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,141
(gasps)

389
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,185
Hello, U.N.
Women's Conference!

390
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,270
Wha...?!

391
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,781
We're trapped!

392
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,450
Lisa, we may not make it,

393
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,578
but at least we can go out
as the great journalists we are.

394
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,621
I'm not a journalist!

395
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,873
You are now.

396
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,541
Remember to keep my boobs
in the shot.

397
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,252
And we're on
in five, four, three...

398
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,010
I don't see Lisa
in any of the seminars.

399
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,220
And I'm growing ashamed
of my penis.

400
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,680
(gasps):
Homer, look!

401
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,017
I'm here at the long-dormant
Springfield Volcano,

402
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,020
which is now spewing noxious
debris into the air.

403
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,021
How male.

404
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,230
(all muttering agreement)

405
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,484
With me is my eight-year-old
camera girl, Lisa Simpson.

406
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,697
She's taken my daughter
to an erupting volcano?

407
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,990
That's it!

408
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,201
She is off
the Christmas card list.

409
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,619
Marge,
that's crazy talk.

410
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,412
Now look.
I'll save Lisa.

411
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,997
Your place is here
with the women.

412
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,415
ALL:
Boo!

413
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,167
Okay, you go save Lisa.

414
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,627
I'll stay here
with the women.

415
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,003
ALL:
Boo!

416
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,255
What do women want?!

417
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,549
(whimpers)

418
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,551
We've gotta go now!

419
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,261
Okay. I'll run
as fast as I can,

420
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,472
but I'm full
of potato salad.

421
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,556
(groans)

422
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,144
I'm sorry, folks.

423
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,479
You're not allowed
to go up there.

424
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,689
In fact, I don't
even know why I'm here.

425
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,066
This lava is
not a criminal.

426
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,442
It hasn't hurt anybody.

427
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,946
(man screaming)

428
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,031
Anybody I know.

429
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,242
Chief, my daughter's
up there.

430
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,035
You're a father, too.

431
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,036
Yeah, but I'm
a cop first...

432
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,039
then a boat enthusiast...
amateur historian...

433
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,042
yo-yo dieter...
then I'm a cop again...

434
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,378
LISA:
Help! Help!

435
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,089
So much
sulfur dioxide!

436
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,384
I'm coming, sweetheart!

437
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,468
(tires squeal)

438
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,724
I'll save you, Lisa!

439
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,518
-(rumbling)
-Oh, my God!

440
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,104
Whoa!

441
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,939
Whoo...!

442
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,107
Be careful, Mom!

443
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,068
There's hot lava
under the ground!

444
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,070
Actually,
when it's underground,

445
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,489
lava is called <i>magma.</i>

446
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,700
You're so smart,
Chloe!

447
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,911
Walter Cronkite told me
the same thing.

448
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:23,996
Shut up!

449
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,964
(grunting)

450
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,845
Mom, that was
incredible!

451
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,640
Nothing's more powerful
than a mother's love.

452
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,975
Mom, your hair!

453
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,768
Don't worry.
We've got two hours

454
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,562
before it burns down
to my head.

455
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,355
Our top story tonight:

456
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,899
I'm about to die!

457
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,532
Barney,
you saved my life.

458
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,327
Chloe, when you left me,
I was devastated.

459
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,828
But I sobered up
long enough

460
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,205
to become a pilot.

461
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,123
With you beside me,

462
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,126
I think I could
make it work.

463
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,128
How 'bout a half hour
of pity sex?

464
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,755
Is there
any other kind?

465
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:15,797
(belches)

466
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,598

Mom, I wanna be just like you.

472
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,154
I mean the lava part,
not saving Lisa.

473
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,240
Pretend to care!

474
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,661
Well, looking
at you kids,

475
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,163
I know I made
the right choice in life.

476
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,790
I'm sure you did.

477
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,166
But still,
don't you ever wonder

478
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,585
what might have happened if
things had gone differently?

479
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,670
Well...

480
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,424
This is Marge Simpson
reporting from Lake Placid

481
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:04,096
where the miracle on ice
never happened.

482
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,806
No!

483
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,065
(grunting)

484
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,025
Lisa, what are you doing
in there?

485
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,195
Praying to Buddha,
Jesus, SpongeBob.

486
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,197
There's no time
to be picky.

487
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,407
Perhaps we should help.

488
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:29,705
Screw her!
(laughs crazily)

489
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,188
