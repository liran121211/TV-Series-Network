00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,746
-(hacks)
-(groans)

179
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,667
I tell you, guys,
having a kid that likes you

180
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,794
is the greatest feeling
in the world.

181
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,629
I never got along
with my old man.

182
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,548
He was always disappointed
I didn't follow him

183
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,966
in the family business.

184
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,385
-What did he do?
-He was editor of <i>Life</i> magazine.

185
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,638
-I thought that was defunct.
-Eh, he keeps saying a real son

186
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,056
would've bought it
out of bankruptcy

187
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,891
and launched it
as a digital platform.

188
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,894
Well, angel funders
want too much equity.

189
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,730
Sorry, Dad.

190
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,234
(sighs) Yeah, my dad left
when I was most vulnerable,

191
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,904
the day after Mom left.
That was a tough week there.

192
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,990
(crying)

193
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,203
Not a good time
to film a commercial.

194
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,080
Don't worry,
we'll take these cameras

195
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,916
and we'll make
a Netflix documentary.

196
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,712
They will buy anything!

197
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,896
<i>(Marge humming)</i>

198
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,608
For dessert,
I made blackberry pie.

199
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,777
Oh, I made Dad a blueberry pie.

200
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,614
Oh, what to do, what to do?

201
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:18,367
In the words of King Solomon,
I shall eat two pies.

202
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,786
I don't think King Solomon
said that.

203
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,913
Maybe it was a king salmon.

204
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,709
The point is, pies are good.

205
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,881
Homer, I think Bart
could use a little attention.

206
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,592
(sighs) Give attention to Lisa,
give attention to Bart.

207
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,053
What am I, made of attention?

208
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,309
Okay, because
of budget cutbacks,

209
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,644
you got 45 seconds each.

210
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,771
40 after the explanation.
You, get in!

211
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,147
What you're experiencing
is a phenomenon

212
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,649
known as transference,
where you project your feelings

213
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,067
towards your mother
onto your art teacher.

214
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,235
Anytime you find yourself
wanting to hug Mrs. Hakamuchi,

215
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,488
-snap this rubber band
on your wrist.
-Ow.

216
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,572
-(timer dings)
-Next!

217
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,493
What are you waiting for?
I'm here for an hour,

218
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,661
then I'm off to
14 other schools.

219
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,162
I eat lunch in my car
'cause they won't let me

220
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,664
counsel kids with food
in my mouth.

221
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,499
Well, I always thought
my dad was a big fat loser

222
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,584
until he started giving
attention to my lame-o sister.

223
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,252
So why do I want
his attention now?

224
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,462
Why does this hurt?

225
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,672
Family members are
locked into roles.

226
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,756
Change that,
and what do you get?

227
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,840
Resentment and acting out.

228
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:15,966
Acting out can take many forms,

229
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,134
from pouting to armed robbery.

230
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,302
-Time's almost up.
-So, what do I do?

231
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,512
You have no choice.

232
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,138
Act out until somebody
pays attention to you.

233
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,015
-(timer dings)
-Next!

234
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,101
Okay, couples therapy.
You got 90 seconds.

235
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,895
BOTH: I'm the oldest,
and she won't admit it.

236
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,149
Milhouse, I'm about to act out.

237
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,152
After we leave an envelope
full of guilt.

238
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,613
Also, we're stopping by
the photo booth

239
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,157
-and the perfume room.
-Enough.

240
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,618
(reading in Hebrew)

241
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,625
(groans)

242
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,877
Come on, sweetie,
pick up the pace.

243
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,130
The sushi's been sitting out
for an hour.

244
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,883
When Willie turned 13, it was
time to work in the mines.

245
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,385
It's go time.

246
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,679
(wheezing)

247
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,140
Help. My friend's having
an asthma attack.

248
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,560
Not yet, Bart.
This is a real one.

249
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,061
-(grunts)
-Even better.

250
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,564
(wheezing)

251
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,983
Please, we've got to get him
to the hospital.

252
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,695
Wow. I'm gonna meet a nurse.

253
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,739
(bicycle bell rings)

254
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,824
(Shauna reading in Hebrew)

255
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:29,206
And now we're gonna party
like it's 5799.

256
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,875
Wait, wait, wait.

257
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,336
Before you leave,
I am going to talk.

258
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,923
And I'm going to tell you
a very long joke.

259
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,592
Please stand.

260
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,887
So, an old rabbi

261
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,182
was confronted with squirrels
in the attic.

262
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,934
Get to the punch line
or your son flunks geometry.

263
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,186
He gave the squirrels
a bar mitzvah

264
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,270
and never saw them
in temple again.

265
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,605
Amen.

266
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,193
(angry chatter)

267
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,111
I don't drive a minivan.

268
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,281
Do I look like a suburban
soccer mom from Phoenix?

269
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,617
Well, sometimes,
when you're tired.

270
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,619
-Shut up!
-I should be first.

271
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,620
I own a Tesla.

272
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,121
Those are my keys.

273
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,290
Prepare for the boning
of your life.

274
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,875
(grunts)

275
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,211
(shouting)

276
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:20,132
To repeat, I own a Tesla,
and I'm going to use "summon."

277
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,968
Aah!

278
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,637
(all gasp)

279
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,557
Who is responsible
for this meshugana behavior?

280
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,893
-He did it.
-(gasps)

281
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,744
Oh...

282
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,581
<i>Hey, Mr. Cunningham.</i>

283
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,959
<i>I said hey, Mr. Cunningham.</i>

284
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,460
I didn't do it.
Nobody saw me do it.

285
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,838
They know I did it.
Protect me, Dad.

286
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,757
SCOUT: <i>Don't you remember me,</i>
<i>Mr. Cunningham?</i>

287
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,551
<i>I'm Jean Louise Finch.</i>

288
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,265
(shouting)

289
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,393
Where's your boy?

290
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,270
(Southern accent):
What's your hurry, friend?

291
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,731
Now, Homer, don't you try
to disarm us

292
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:21,694
with your genteel mannerisms
of a bygone era there.

293
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:25,614
Why, I haven't a notion
as to what you are importuning,

294
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,032
good sir.

295
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,617
(angry chatter)

296
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,336
(gunshot)

297
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,338
(Southern accent):
Excuse me, Mr. Szyslak.

298
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,133
Mr. Szyslak, we know you.

299
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,011
My father likes to drink
at your bar.

300
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,305
You can't say hi to me?

301
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,973
(sobbing)

302
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,142
And how 'bout you, Chief Wiggum?

303
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,394
I go to school
with your boy, Ralph.

304
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,814
Give my regards to Ralph,
would you, please?

305
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,233
All right, let's go, people.
They've defused us.

306
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,736
Everyone get, uh,
get one last mutter in.

307
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,280
(all muttering)

308
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,743
Oh, Lisa, sweetie, you saved me.

309
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,078
No, Dad, you saved us all

310
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,205
with your calmness and bravery.

311
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,917
-Thanks. Just one thing.
-Yes, Dad?

312
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,585
Don't tell your mother
about the mob

313
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,920
that almost killed your brother.

314
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,755
She's taken a liking to him.

315
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,089
MARGE:
The what?

316
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,759
You're hearing things
in the shower again, Marge.

317
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,511
Oh, okay.

318
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,263
-(gunshot)
-WIGGUM: Sorry.

319
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,689
Okay, Maggie,
you give me your binky,

320
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,274
and I'll give you

321
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,027
this substitution bear doll.

322
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,783
You can't beat addiction, Marge.

323
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,118
I got addicted
to Agatha Christie books.

324
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,872
I always thought the murderer
was that know-it-all Belgian.

325
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,375
Turns out he was the detective.

326
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,628
41 books, and I never
saw it coming.

327
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,630
-(Lisa groans)
-(gasps)

328
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,132
-What happened?
-Got in a fight.

329
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,301
Why? What did the other kid do?

330
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,762
Said Dad was lazy
and incompetent.

331
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,472
And where is this other kid?

332
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,640
-Yo.
-(gasps)

333
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,558
You got in a fight
with your brother?

334
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,435
I <i>won</i> a fight with my brother.

335
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,062
-Liar.
-Let's go again.

336
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,897
Stop her, Mom.

337
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,483
(Marge groans)

338
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,068
To combat bed-wetting,
doctors recommend

339
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,486
shifting times for drinking,
scheduling bathroom breaks,

340
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,780
and being encouraging.
I'll deny having said this,

341
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,323
but the next time you wet
your bed, have 'em spank you.

342
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,826
-Next.
-(timer dings)

343
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,494
Wait, you're not a kid.
Doesn't matter.

344
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,829
You've got 45 seconds. Go.

345
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,415
I'm worried that my daughter
is ruining her family

346
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,500
idolizing her father.

347
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,460
I see. Wow. Marge,
it's totally normal

348
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,295
for a little girl to be
infatuated with her father.

349
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,839
It's safe and comes
from a good place,

350
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,632
and when it ends, it's another
thing she'll blame you for.

351
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,427
Yes, well, I'm afraid
my husband isn't always

352
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,846
a perfect influence.

353
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,016
Marge, I've got a legal matter
to deal with.

354
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,018
I'll be outside.

355
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,772
Also, I'm worried that my son
is feeling neglected.

356
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,357
Your husband has to give your
daughter the perfect speech,

357
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,359
which lets her down
but doesn't snap her in two.

358
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,861
And make sure you don't
have any more kids.

359
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,113
Sounds like it'll be a disaster.

360
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,782
Whoa, nice to meet you.
See you in three years.

361
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,950
-(timer dings)
-Now, goodbye.

362
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,373
-Homer?
-Huh? What?

363
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,043
Homer, it's sweet that
Lisa idolizes you,

364
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,295
but I think it's gone too far.

365
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,713
You're right.

366
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,048
<i>Tell her she's right.</i>

367
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,215
I just did.

368
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,301
<i>I'm on a five-second delay.</i>

369
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,470
The kids are at
each other's throats.

370
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,972
Look, you can't be my dog
and hers. Pick a side.

371
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,390
(whimpers)

372
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,518
You can't hide in there forever.

373
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,854
-(toots)
-(barking)

374
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,690
Okay, I'll talk to Bart,
you talk to Lisa.

375
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,984
We've got to put this family
back in place.

376
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,361
Okay. Why do you
always tell me

377
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,740
the most important things just
when I'm about to fall asleep?

378
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:58,327
Because I think the pillow talk
between a woman and her husband

379
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,580
is the most important...

380
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,916
What? How did I
wind up in church?

381
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,253
What's wrong, sweetie?

382
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,672
I've got that terrible feeling
where I'm almost

383
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,257
at the end of a great book,

384
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,427
and once I finish,
it's over forever.

385
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,097
Well, that's kind of what
I wanted to talk to you about.

386
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,350
You and I have had a lot of fun
these past few weeks,

387
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,435
but you aren't always gonna
look up to your dad

388
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,937
as much as you do now.

389
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,605
Bup, bup, bup.
Great man,

390
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,608
there is nothing you could do
to make me lose one iota

391
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,027
of respect for you.

393
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,367
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be that guy,

394
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,619
but now I can't fit
behind a door.

395
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,789
You'll discover I'm not
the perfect man you think.

396
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,749
Okay, I'll finish my book.

397
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,418
But always remember
you're my dad,

398
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,630

the way you and...

399

I've been hurt before.

Okay, Bart, because
we treasure you, too,

I'm gonna let you do one thing
just for yourself.

Kick Homer in the butt?

Uh, why don't you
give it some thought.

Never brush my teeth again.

Be homeschooled by the dog.

Drive a tank through
Skinner's house.
