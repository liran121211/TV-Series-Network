00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,744
Everyone...

3
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:13,746
Was napping.

4
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:15,748
- Ahmed Adoody.
- Wait, there's...

5
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:17,049
- ♪ My people. ♪
- come down to the Stu...

6
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:22,421
Steamed ham.

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,791
The cosmic ballet goes on.

8
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,092
- Gigantism.
- King of the world!

9
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:29,394
Oh, this is the best gift of all, Homer.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,396
- It is?
- What's his name?

11
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:32,831
Number Eight.

12
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:35,234
Uh, I mean, Santa's Little Helper.

13
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:38,303
Why does Homer talk like Walter Matthau?

14
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,511
Hey, Martin Princess.

15
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:49,014
If you like that cello so much,
why don't you marry it?

16
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,350
- No heckling.
- Way to quash 'em, sir.

17
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,585
Hey, Skinner, if you
like Chalmers so much,

18
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:55,120
why don't you marry him?

19
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:56,522
Well, as the superintendent,

20
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,457
he's married to all the principals.

21
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,459
Thank you. You've made the anniversary

22
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:03,195
of my wife's death even more depressing.

23
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,030
Who likes happy songs?

24
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:08,834
Well, for those of you who didn't cheer,

25
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:12,671
here's a very sad song
about the world today.

26
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,874
She loves me. She loves me not.

27
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,777
Oh, why do I always use
flowers with two petals?

28
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,956
Simpson, pull the fire alarm.

29
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,457
You want me to embarrass my sister

30
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:33,859
in front of the whole school?

31
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:34,893
No.

32
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,895
I dared you.

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,666
Don't do it, Bart.

34
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,734
Please. I love you.

35
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,037
I'm not doing it. I'm refusing a dare.

36
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:48,006
You just signed your
death warrant, Simpson.

37
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:50,175
And we're the witnesses.

38
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:53,312
All we need is a notary.

39
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:57,182
- Notary. Notary.
- We'll see.

40
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:58,917
Oh, it's that kid who refused a dare.

41
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,552
His life is ruined.

42
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:03,021
I'm turning my back on you.

43
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:04,823
Hi, Bart.

44
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,191
Simpson, I'd like to
see you in my office.

45
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:07,593
Your parents are waiting.

46
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,194
Whoa.

47
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,662
Bart's got a dad.

48
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:12,664
Bart's got a dad.

49
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,233
I do not.

50
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,903
Bart, I just want to say...

51
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:20,405
I'm so proud of you.

52
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:22,741
Dad, do you think I did the right thing?

53
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,877
Of course, absolutely.

54
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:27,512
You did the worst thing any boy can do.

55
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:30,449
It's worse than wetting your
pants while on Santa's lap,

56
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,718
and I've been on both sides of that one.

57
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:33,785
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,788
Bart, you have to take a dare.

59
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,757
- B-B-But what if it's...?
- Any dare.

60
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,293
GRAMPA, Dad says I have to take a dare.

61
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,028
I had Homer on a dare,

62
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:45,931
and as horrible as that worked
out, I'd do that again.

63
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,033
Why did someone dare you to have Homer?

64
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,269
It was after the war; we needed babies.

65
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:52,437
Bart, I have a secret.

66
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,940
I've never been happier
to be your mother.

67
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,875
You're a good boy.

68
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:59,945
Mom, please. Somebody might hear you.

69
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,418
Oh, look at him!

70
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:09,254
Ha-ha. Bart's mom wears a seat belt.

71
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,424
Let them laugh, Bart.

72
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,059
This is wonderful.

73
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:17,663
Every laugh turns into one
more smoochie-poo from Mom.

74
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,400
Cut it out.

75
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,771
Three cheers for the mama's boys.

76
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,906
Sorry to do this on Mother's Day!

77
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,314
So, Simpson, word on the street is

78
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,316
you're looking for a dare.

79
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:38,984
Yeah, fine.

80
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,953
I need to get this monkey off my back.

81
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,921
Hey, how about that for a dare?

82
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:44,589
Putting a monkey on his back.

83
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,458
And after we're done, then what?

84
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:49,294
We have a monkey that's our
permanent responsibility.

85
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,030
Yeah, think ahead, dingus.

86
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:55,667
Simpson, I dare you to
jump into the reservoir

87
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,436
from Dead Boy's Ledge.

88
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:00,672
We'll be watching from Haw-Haw Heights.

89
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,477
Simpson, is that your kid?

90
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,279
Oh, my God. I've got to stop him!

91
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,680
I dare you not to.

92
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:10,349
Oh, uh, oh.

93
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,217
It was a joke, idiot. Get your kid.

94
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,454
Bart!

95
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,289
Do I really have to do this?

96
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,523
I dare you.

97
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,058
Dare you. Dare you.

98
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,060
Dare you.

99
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,829
I love Echo Canyon.

100
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,897
Oh, this place sure has a lot of names.

101
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,899
Cowabunga!

102
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,637
We've done all we could.

103
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:33,638
Run!

104
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:34,873
Beat it!

105
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,809
He'll be fine.

106
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:41,246
And my burrito's ready.

107
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,714
Mmm.

108
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,850
Your boy should wake up soon. Mmm.

109
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,319
All right. This time,
he's really done it.

110
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,154
We're gonna have to do something.

111
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,390
Change schools. Move.

112
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,358
Whatever it takes.

113
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:54,726
Mom?

114
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:57,596
- Sweetie, are you okay?
- I am.

115
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,732
Then why would you do such
a stupid, stupid thing?

116
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,934
Marge, Marge. As someone
who's fallen off

117
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,736
a cliff multiple times,

118
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,571
the best thing we can do

119
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:09,207
is teach him how to fall off cliffs.

120
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:10,909
I just want to know, Bart.

121
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,912
I had hope and now I don't. Why?

122
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,082
Please, O Lord.

123
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,351
Let him think of an awesome lie.

124
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:23,588
Well, when I was in the other world...

125
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:24,689
What other world?

126
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:25,891
Hmm, hmm...

127
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,626
I'm not sure.

128
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:32,230
But it was joyful, clouds,
harps, Abe Lincoln.

129
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,865
Oh, my God, Marge!

130
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,434
I think our son went to heaven.

131
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,868
Were there any other presidents?

132
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:39,404
- No.
- It was heaven. What else, boy?

133
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,906
I have a message for you, Mom.

134
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,908
- From who?
- Jesus.

135
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,077
Don't say that if it's not true.

136
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,478
You have to believe him, Marge.

137
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,313
It's a deathbed confession.

138
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,781
He's not on his deathbed.

139
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:52,651
The guy in the bed before him died.

140
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,621
Mom. Jesus said to tell you,
"Things will get better."

141
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:59,458
Oh, I really want to believe that.

142
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:02,127
If you saw Jesus, did
you see anything else?

143
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,429
I saw your dad, Grandpa Bouvier.

144
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:07,432
Tell me something he said
that only I would know.

145
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:08,900
- He said...
- Hmm?

146
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,135
he thinks Homer is an idiot.

147
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,673
Oh, my God, I can hear
his voice through you.

148
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,608
Excuse me a minute.

149
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:17,976
Good work, boy.

150
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,811
You got us off the hook
in the short term,

151
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,781
which is all that ever matters.

152
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:29,668
- Tell me more about heaven, son.
- Jesus rides a rainbow horse.

153
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:31,975
Fascinating. Is the
horse rainbow-colored?

154
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:33,910
Or does it walk on a rainbow?

155
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,673
Uh... rainbows come out its butt.

156
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:39,033
Let me ponder that with joy.

157
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:41,268
Mmm. Tell me more, son.

158
00:06:41,304 --> 00:06:43,671
Well, there's no cracks
on the sidewalks.

159
00:06:43,706 --> 00:06:45,806
And saying you brushed
your teeth makes it true.

160
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:50,711
You can go to baseball games
with all the dead players.

161
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:52,513
And you always catch a home run.

162
00:06:52,548 --> 00:06:54,348
And the angels talk to
each other like this:

163
00:06:55,952 --> 00:06:58,619
Does this, uh, Jesus have any tattoos

164
00:06:58,654 --> 00:07:00,421
or distinguishing marks?

165
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:04,258
No, but he really thinks
the sermons are too long.

166
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:07,928
Boys, we're gonna have a
talk with the Reverend.

167
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:12,900
Bart.

168
00:07:12,935 --> 00:07:14,902
I've held my tongue,
because I appreciate

169
00:07:14,937 --> 00:07:16,770
you not ruining my song.

170
00:07:16,806 --> 00:07:19,406
Can't ruin what already sucks. Burn.

171
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:22,443
All right. I'm just gonna say it.

172
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:24,612
I don't think you really saw Jesus.

173
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:26,113
You know, the Lord warned me

174
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:28,249
there'd be disbelievers. Begone!

175
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:31,085
I don't know why you're
doing this, but beware,

176
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,587
little lies lead to big lies.

177
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:36,891
And big lies get punished.

178
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:39,426
Ooh! That's the Devil ringing that bell.

179
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:40,995
Are you gonna answer?

180
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,930
Hey, don't think you can
scare the boy who died

181
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:44,465
and went to heaven.

182
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,734
Get the door.

183
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:49,236
Hey, cut it out.

184
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:51,305
Oh, no, it's stuck.

185
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,240
Hello, Bart.

186
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:55,643
We are Christian movie producers.

187
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:59,547
So... you give all your
profits back to the church?

188
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:02,583
Uh...

189
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:04,818
You... uh... Could you, uh, uh...

190
00:08:04,854 --> 00:08:06,587
Could you get your dad?

191
00:08:06,622 --> 00:08:09,023
Homer, we're the best in the business.

192
00:08:09,058 --> 00:08:12,359
Our films average 98% on
Rotten Communion Wafers.

193
00:08:12,395 --> 00:08:16,030
Now, we'd like to tell your son's story.

194
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:19,433
You want to make a movie out
of what happened to Bart?

195
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:20,634
Well, absolutely.

196
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,336
Unless it's not true.

197
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:26,273
Okay, I could admit the boy totally lied

198
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:31,011
or I could make a movie
inspired by true events.

199
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:35,549
Brother Homer, why do you hesitate?

200
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:39,019
I hesitate because I am stunned

201
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:41,355
that you doubt the Word of God!

202
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,356
Whoa.

203
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:43,357
Then we have a deal.

204
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:44,725
Not so fast.

205
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,661
Like most of America, I think
I know the movie business.

206
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:49,863
Please. What would you like?

207
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:51,465
I want input on the script.

208
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,567
I want two seats to the premiere.

209
00:08:53,603 --> 00:08:55,469
And my wife needs a seat as well.

210
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:57,671
And I'm not thanking the
Georgia Film Commission,

211
00:08:57,707 --> 00:08:59,173
no matter what.

212
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,875
We will need to pray on
this, Brother Homer.

213
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:03,811
Of course. So will we.

214
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:05,312
Kneel down, boy.

215
00:09:05,348 --> 00:09:06,480
What for?

216
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:11,485
Because we're going to
pray like we often do.

217
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,922
Heavenly God, who art in
heaven, holler out your name.

218
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:17,691
Thy Kingdom come. I'm almost done.

219
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:20,227
Ooh. Can this square join your circle?

220
00:09:20,263 --> 00:09:22,329
Absotively-posilutely.

221
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:24,531
In that same spirit,
I'm glad to hear it.

222
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:25,897
- Oh, hi-diddly-do.
- A-dum-dum-diddly.

223
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:27,901
- Diddly-doodly, brother.
- Diddly-doodly-diddly-dice.

224
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:29,737
- Nice to diddly meet you.
- Brotherino.

225
00:09:29,772 --> 00:09:33,440
I heard movie meetings were
horrible, but I had no idea.

226
00:09:33,476 --> 00:09:35,042
Well, perhaps you could write

227
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:37,077
the screenplay with Brother Homer.

228
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:38,846
Um, eh, I don't think so.

229
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:40,414
Wait, wait, wait.

230
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:42,449
I'm being filled with
the spirit of Jesus.

231
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:45,586
Oh, yeah? What's he saying?

232
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:48,389
He says he wants Dad and Mr. Flanders

233
00:09:48,424 --> 00:09:51,625
to work together day after
day in a tiny room,

234
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:53,394
preferably holding hands.

235
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:54,695
Why, you...

236
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,897
No booze, sodas, or chocolate milk.

237
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:59,433
And the only snacks are celery sticks.

238
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:01,035
Celery sticks.

239
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,103
Not done yet.

240
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:05,739
Dad, Jesus wants you to
take Flanders bowling.

241
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:08,042
Tie his shoes for him.

242
00:10:08,077 --> 00:10:09,777
- What for?
- And kiss his ball.

243
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:12,413
- Why, you...
- This is the Word of the Lord.

244
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:15,616
With that kind of attention,
I could roll a 73.

245
00:10:15,651 --> 00:10:21,021
Oh...

246
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,564
What are you guys doing?

247
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,566
What's it look like? We're working.

248
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:36,570
Maybe we should take a break.

249
00:10:36,605 --> 00:10:38,605
Good idea.

250
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:41,508
Okay, come on.

251
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:44,778
Lenny, you've pitched "That's
what she said" 30 times already.

252
00:10:44,814 --> 00:10:46,947
I highly doubt that's the Word of God.

253
00:10:46,982 --> 00:10:48,782
- Try something else.
- That's what she said.

254
00:10:48,818 --> 00:10:50,584
That's great!

255
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:52,019
That's going in.

256
00:10:52,054 --> 00:10:54,254
Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine.

257
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,524
Lenny and me. Mine.
Mostly mine. Mine. Mine.

258
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,860
I was thinking it when
Barney said it. Mine.

259
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:02,963
Reading for Marge... Emily Deschanel.

260
00:11:02,998 --> 00:11:05,499
Oh, yeah. Uh, first,
I have a question for you.

261
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:08,869
On Bones, did you ever have any
bones with meat left on them,

262
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:10,771
and if so, where are those bones?

263
00:11:10,806 --> 00:11:12,873
Maybe she should just read the part.

264
00:11:12,908 --> 00:11:16,009
Homie, because of
everything that's happened,

265
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:18,045
I think we need to take a break.

266
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,514
No! Marge, no!

267
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:22,015
A break means forever.

268
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:23,851
I'll change. I will.

269
00:11:23,886 --> 00:11:25,986
No, Homer, she's just acting the part.

270
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:28,889
Oh. Oh, of course, of course, yes.

271
00:11:28,924 --> 00:11:31,225
As a help to me, when you're acting,

272
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,660
could you hold up one hand so I'll know?

273
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:35,229
Oh, o-okay.

274
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:37,064
- Thank you.
- Homie.

275
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:38,665
Yes, Marge. You have a question?

276
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:40,134
Ugh. She's acting!

277
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:42,669
Right, right, right. She's acting.

278
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:44,705
When you're acting,
could you raise one arm

279
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,341
and swing your foot in a
circle and keep winking?

280
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:49,209
Listen, Homie.

281
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:51,645
Marge, what are you doing?!
You're acting really weird.

282
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,213
Is he okay?

283
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:55,582
You thought I was okay
when you married me.

284
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:57,217
Actors.

285
00:11:57,253 --> 00:11:59,219
Gal Gadot reading for Lisa.

286
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:01,054
- You've got the part!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

287
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,257
I know you were great
in Fast and Furious,

288
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:05,025
but what else have you been in?

289
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,760
Uh... did you see Wonder Woman?

290
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:10,063
Whenever I see the DC logo,
I immediately fall asleep.

291
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:11,665
Homer, she's got the part.

292
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,735
Okay, you get this and I
get Gene Hackman for me.

293
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,069
Huh. He already said no.

294
00:12:16,105 --> 00:12:17,938
Then you have to help me kidnap him.

295
00:12:17,973 --> 00:12:19,373
Excuse me.

296
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:21,608
So, do you want to put me on tape or...?

297
00:12:21,644 --> 00:12:25,078
Hey! Can we use your magic
lasso to kidnap Gene Hackman?

298
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:26,513
No.

299
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:28,182
Barney is here to read for Noah.

300
00:12:28,217 --> 00:12:30,417
There's no Noah in this movie.

301
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:32,986
All right, but you
better tell the camels.

302
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:40,694
Mom, do you really believe Bart's story?

303
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:43,864
Lisa, do you know how I've
gotten to this point in life?

304
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:46,967
Two things... blind faith
and a little wine.

305
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:49,703
Can you get me the wine that I
keep in Mommy's knitting basket?

306
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:52,439
I know where you keep it.

307
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:54,975
There was no knitting in there.

308
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,944
Ah!

309
00:12:56,979 --> 00:13:00,747
Jesus said to tell you,
"Things will get better."

310
00:13:00,783 --> 00:13:03,317
And... cut.

311
00:13:03,352 --> 00:13:05,953
I wish you and I had
a relationship like that.

312
00:13:05,988 --> 00:13:07,654
Why, you little...

313
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:13,460
They wish they had
a relationship like us!

314
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:17,297
Uh, there is nothing a director
can do on set that's wrong.

315
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:20,467
Take five, everybody.

316
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:22,069
What do you want?

317
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:24,238
I told you, lies lead to punishment,

318
00:13:24,273 --> 00:13:26,440
especially when you film them.

319
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:28,742
What are you talking about?

320
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:30,744
If you really saw Grandpa Bouvier,

321
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,412
which finger was he missing?

322
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:34,748
I believe he was wearing
a beekeeping outfit

323
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:36,283
when I saw him.

324
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:38,318
Trick question. He's missing a leg.

325
00:13:38,354 --> 00:13:40,454
Okay.

326
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:42,289
So maybe I fudged a few things.

327
00:13:42,324 --> 00:13:44,758
It's not the original lie
that gets people.

328
00:13:44,793 --> 00:13:46,460
It's the cover-up.

329
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:48,595
It's gonna get worse and worse

330
00:13:48,631 --> 00:13:51,365
and worse and worse and worse.

331
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,333
Dad, I'm starting to feel weird.

332
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:56,270
I'm not your Dad.
I'm the actor playing him.

333
00:13:56,305 --> 00:13:58,505
You need all that padding to play Homer?

334
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,007
Yes, and I'm fat to begin with.

335
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:04,321
Okay, this one's for China.

336
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:07,461
This one's for Australia.

337
00:14:07,461 --> 00:14:09,561
And this one's for the youth market.

338
00:14:09,597 --> 00:14:11,563
- Dad?
- This is all because of you.

339
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:13,298
I have never been so excited.

340
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:15,067
Now what do you want to say?

341
00:14:15,102 --> 00:14:17,803
Um, is there anything
you want to tell anyone?

342
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:20,706
Any inaccuracies or blatant lies?

343
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,676
The scene we said is New York

344
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:27,446
is actually downtown Calgary,

345
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:28,981
and vice versa.

346
00:14:33,954 --> 00:14:36,855
No, no. I'm going to heaven!

347
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:42,661
Hello, Bart.

348
00:14:42,696 --> 00:14:44,696
Didn't they give you
a real leg in heaven?

349
00:14:44,732 --> 00:14:46,198
I lost it in a bet.

350
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:48,834
A bet that my grandson was a good boy.

351
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:50,469
Save me, Jesus!

352
00:14:50,504 --> 00:14:52,604
I'm trying very hard to forgive you.

353
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,106
It is very tough.

354
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:56,175
What are you gonna do to me?

355
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,010
Bart, God is love.

356
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:14,626
And here's Marge with the
actress who played her.

357
00:15:14,662 --> 00:15:16,728
Oh, in real life we don't get along.

358
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:22,234
Who are you worshipping?

359
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:24,069
Are you telling the truth?

360
00:15:24,104 --> 00:15:25,537
He will not be taking any questions

361
00:15:25,573 --> 00:15:26,972
unless they're submitted in writing

362
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:29,174
on an index card with some bacon on it.

363
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,176
Turkey bacon does not count.

364
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:35,981
Tell the people what you
have witnessed, Bartholomew.

365
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:39,418
And if they doubt you, viciously
attack their character.

366
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:41,453
Yes, Jesus.

367
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:46,325
Bart, you're my hero.

368
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,393
Now, who wants a hamburger?

369
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:50,562
I would never say any of those things.

370
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:53,999
Now sing, Bart.

371
00:15:54,034 --> 00:15:57,135
Sing because I cannot.

Oh, someone pinch me.

383
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:46,785
Thank you. Thank you
for this Christian Oscar.

384
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,254
And I'd like to thank
the Academy of Arts

385
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,656
and Anti-Sciences.

386
00:16:51,992 --> 00:16:53,392
Are you guys awake?

387
00:16:53,427 --> 00:16:55,627
Mm. What's the matter, sweetie?

388
00:16:55,663 --> 00:16:58,563
Mom, I lied about everything.

389
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,098
Oh, my God!

390
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:01,633
Don't worry, Marge.

391
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:03,502
It's just a little movie.
Nobody will see it.

392
00:17:03,537 --> 00:17:05,237
Mr. Flanders just called.

393
00:17:05,272 --> 00:17:08,674
The movie's on pace to make
a hundred million dollars.

394
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:11,276
It crushed all the good movies
that came out this week.

395
00:17:11,312 --> 00:17:13,145
Take that, Paul Thomas Anderson.

396
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,682
Oh, my God. Our movie's a hit and a lie.

397
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:18,750
Oh, all hit movies are lies, Marge.

398
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:20,585
Did you see Argo?

399
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:22,120
None of that happened.

400
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:24,356
And I have strong doubts
about The Incredibles.

401
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:26,491
Well, we have to tell people the truth.

402
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,859
Of course, of course.

403
00:17:27,895 --> 00:17:29,761
Could we do it after the Golden Globes?

404
00:17:29,797 --> 00:17:31,163
MARGE, LISA AND BART: No!

405
00:17:31,198 --> 00:17:32,698
But that's the one with TV people

406
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:34,333
and movie people in the same room.

407
00:17:34,368 --> 00:17:35,801
We said no!

408
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:40,472
First off,

409
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:43,809
we will donate every penny
of our profits to charity.

410
00:17:43,844 --> 00:17:45,777
Keeping only enough money

411
00:17:45,813 --> 00:17:48,714
to cover changing our
lives in a major way.

412
00:17:48,749 --> 00:17:50,716
Hey, what is this?

413
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:52,851
Fine, fine, fine, all of it.

414
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:55,153
Okay, look, I just want to say,

415
00:17:55,189 --> 00:17:57,789
I'm just a man trying to raise his son.

416
00:17:57,825 --> 00:17:59,524
I make mistakes.

417
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,693
Sometimes they're little,
sometimes they're big.

418
00:18:01,729 --> 00:18:05,564
Blame me, but don't blame
the boy for being a boy.

419
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,233
Oh.

420
00:18:08,268 --> 00:18:10,802
And let me just ask this. Is it possible

421
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:13,672
any other religious beliefs
are founded on myths?

422
00:18:13,707 --> 00:18:15,340
This interview is over.

423
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:17,709
God created the world
in seven days. See you later.

424
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:19,578
In what some are calling
the worst scandal

425
00:18:19,613 --> 00:18:22,214
in the history of religion,
Bart Simpson lied

426
00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:24,916
when he claimed he had talked to Jesus.

427
00:18:24,952 --> 00:18:27,386
But maybe part of the fault lies with us

428
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:30,756
for desperately wanting a
miracle in these troubled times.

429
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:34,192
Times which we bring into your
homes at 5:00, 6:00 and 11:00.

430
00:18:34,228 --> 00:18:36,595
Here's a hobo lost in a hurricane.

431
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,197
Um, I had a hat!

432
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:41,099
Hey, Bart.

433
00:18:41,135 --> 00:18:42,434
I brought you some ice cream.

434
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:43,602
Up here.

435
00:18:45,939 --> 00:18:48,907
The only friend I have is
the Frisbee on the roof.

436
00:18:50,577 --> 00:18:52,411
Hmm. Well, you'll always have me.

437
00:18:52,446 --> 00:18:54,079
Careful.

438
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:55,781
Dad didn't nail these in too well.

439
00:18:55,816 --> 00:18:58,524
You think God'll forgive me?

440
00:18:58,524 --> 00:18:59,756
Don't tell anyone I said that.

441
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:02,864
Well, if there is a God,
from what I know,

442
00:19:02,864 --> 00:19:04,564
said God will forgive you

443
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,033
if you truly have remorse in your heart.

444
00:19:07,068 --> 00:19:08,401
Well, thanks, Lis.

445
00:19:08,436 --> 00:19:10,036
Don't tell anyone I asked you that.

446
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:12,171
I did it 'cause you're the
smartest person I know.

447
00:19:12,207 --> 00:19:14,107
And don't tell anybody I said that.

448
00:19:14,142 --> 00:19:15,575
I won't!

449
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:21,714
Dad must have raked the leaves today.

450
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,750
Now that's a miracle.

451
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:34,287
I made it.

452
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,200
Gal Gadot?!

453
00:19:38,236 --> 00:19:40,402
They like me so much, I get to visit.

454
00:19:40,438 --> 00:19:44,206
I made it, too, boy, and Jesus
really wants to meet you.

455
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:45,608
Go on in!

456
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,143
Where are you going?

457
00:19:47,178 --> 00:19:50,312
This place is so boring.

458
00:19:50,348 --> 00:19:52,715
Time for another game
of "Mother, May I?"

459
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,984
Oh!

460
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:57,119
Please send me back to Earth.

461
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:00,289
Yes, yes. You can be a turtle
or a pharmaceutical CEO.

462
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,957
Turtle, please.

463
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,726
Hmm.

464
