If you're gonna turn

The losing the jobs.
The going to Moe's.

The Halloween bucket by the bed.

00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,291
And the licking
of the deodorant sticks.

They're not Popsicles.

00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,422

It's almost midnight.

50
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,176
Marge, look,
I'm really, really trying.

51
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,011
I've applied
to every place in town,

52
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,596
even Lisa's lemonade stand.

53
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,306
You drank half the lemonade.

54
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,601
I can't endorse a product
unless I use the product.

55
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,272
The proceeds were going to the
National Endowment for the Arts.

56
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,399
It was 80% of their funding.

58
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,404

59
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:38,158
But I found a new passion:
watching Korean soap operas.

CarGo is moving to Springfield.

69
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,849
What does the city gain
from this deal?

70
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:06,269
Jobs, eight to 12 jobs.

71
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,855
Okay, Marge, you see that?

72
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,733
It's a sign.
I'm gonna get one of those jobs.

73
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,818
-(chuckles): Yes, you will...

Oh, TV never talks to just me.

77
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,537
Homer, CarGo is on the forefront

78
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,581
of autonomous vehicle
technology.

79
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,583
We're looking
for highly passive humans

80
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,669
to road test
our self-driving cars.

81
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,756
Perfect answer.

82
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,383
Yes, you could not be
more passive, could you?

83
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,844
And your bad driving record
is a big, big plus.

84
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,764
You've apparently never used
your blinkers.

85
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:46,309
What direction I want to go is
<i>my</i> business and no one else's.

86
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,353
USA! USA!

87
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,814
And somehow you've driven
over yourself. Amazing.

88
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,026
Is there anything we don't know
about you that we should?

89
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,071
Well, I'd like you to know
sometimes my road rage

90
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:01,491
is actually home rage
that I bring onto the highway.

91
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,702
Now let's take a look
at your license.

92
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,122
Who exactly are they warning?

93
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,584
My sisters-in-law work
at the DMV.

94
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,127
-Mm. Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

95
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,672
Congratulations, everyone.
You're our finalists.

96
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,508
We just have one last test
for all of you.

97
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,010
Who's capable of sitting
for hours at a time,

98
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,137
doing absolutely nothing?

99
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,099
Finally, a job interview
question I can answer.

100
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,903
(goat bleats)

101
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,159
-You're hired.
-You're hired.

102
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,161
Five more minutes.

103
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,832
Wow, there's no steering wheel.
How do I steer?

104
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,626
No, it's a self-driving car.

105
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,753
Oh, I've never driven
one of those before.

106
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,923
You don't have to.
The car drives itself.

107
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,759
Awesome, awesome.
So is it, like, a joystick

108
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,929
or, like, a turning wheel
for steering?

109
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,764
You just tell it where to go.

110
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,017
Oh, I speak
into the steering wheel.

111
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,019
Antoine, check this out.

112
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,021
The car is driving by itself.

113
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,772
-I'm a genius.
-Now you're free

114
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,650
-to do whatever you like, Homer.
-Can I text while it's driving?

115
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,902
You can write a novel
while you're driving.

116
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,279
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

117
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,448
In today's
publishing environment?

118
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,700
-Hmm.
-Will you look at that?

00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,452
The car is driving Homer.

120
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,370
Oh, as far as I'm concerned,

121
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:33,166
I would never forfeit my control
of the wheel. (burps)

122
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,752
Whoa, Homer's making a smoothie
while he drives.

123
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,420
I want to make smoothies
when I drive.

124
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,005
You don't like smoothies.

125
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,215
I want to make them.

All the food here is free.

Homie, when you lost your job,
I was so worried.

156
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,691
But this is the nicest place
to work I've ever seen.

157
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,319
-Come on, let me show you
around the campus.
-Hmm.

158
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,406
There's the gym,
which has never been used.

159
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,075
Indoor Ferris wheel,
never Ferrised.

160
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,161
Then there's
the rock climbing wall,

161
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,579

00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,061
-Log off.
-Log off.

175
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,771
Come on, Team Blue.

176
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,940
Go, Team Bald.

177
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,402
(all cheering)

178
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,406
Look at Homer
and his surprisingly slim wife

179
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,033
leading that team building
exercise.

180
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,619
Let's check
the real-time brain imaging.

181
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,371
(gasps) Their creative centers
have gone indigo.

182
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,832
-Is that good?
-It ain't scarlet.

183
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,626
Homer and Marge,
what you two did

184
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,253
to inspire our workers
was paradigm blasting.

185
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,131
I'm sorry.
We'll replace the paradigm.

186
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,175
No, no. It's good.

187
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,220
We want to be number one
in employee satisfaction.

188
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,972
-And money.
-We have the competition
by the nuts.

189
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,017
We bought the last affordable
housing in San Francisco.

190
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,853
And Alcatraz has gone condo.

191
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,315
Homer, we're offering you
a promotion

192
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,317
and making Marge your partner.

193
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,652
-Oh.
-(chuckles)

194
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,988
We need people like you
to help our workers relax.

195
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:55,201
Have fun and forget
they may want or have families.

196
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,911
So, what do you say?
Are you in?

197
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,913
Homie, for the first time
in our marriage,

198
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,165
we can work together as a team.

199
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,627
Yeah, well, I'll have to check
with my wife.

200
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,588
-I'd love to.
-She said yes!

201
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,762
Uh, yes, I'll have
one of those coffees

202
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,889
that's actually
a milkshake, please.

203
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,268
Okay, so, what kind of cow
would you like your milk from?

204
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,728
Barnyard basic,
collegiate mascot,

205
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,647
Minnesota full-fat...?

206
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,984
At the cereal bar, you can
request nothing but prizes.

207
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,194
The only thing I don't like

208
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,738
is how I don't understand
what everyone is saying.

209
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,157
Uh, yeah,
is that the, uh, new X4P1?

210
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,952
Yeah, but 18-core doesn't
play nice with the motherboard

211
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,161
unless you overclock.

212
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,788
So, Lisa, what does that mean?

213
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,748
-I don't know.
<i>-You</i> don't know?

214
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,251
-No.
-(singsongy):
You're as stupid as I am.

215
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,378
You're as stupid as I am.

216
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,921
Mom!

217
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,506
(chuckles):
Kids, kids,

218
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,843
you're both stupid
in your own special ways.

219
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,220
Bart's much stupider than I am.

220
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,515
Oh, good girl.
Let your brother win.

221
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,517
Good morning, everybody.

222
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,686
I made lemon squares.

223
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,105
Some, if not most,
appear to be rhombuses.

224
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,858
-Rhombi.
-Both are acceptable.

225
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,611
That was so fun.
Thank-thank you, Marge.

226
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,279
What? You didn't even eat them.

227
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,198
Well, you'll really be thrilled
with what we just found.

228
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,869
There's a regulation hockey rink
on campus.

229
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,831
-Oh. Whoa. Whoa.
-Aah!
-Aah!

230
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:27,084
It's amazing how not
a single one of them can skate.

231
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,213
Ow! Physical activity
makes me so sad.

232
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,884
Oh, no. Doug's in the worst
position of all: fetal.

233
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,761
I know what'll cheer us all up.

234
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,179
The Christmas song
that was written

235
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,181
by an A.I. program.

236
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,934
ROBOTIC VOICE:
♪ <i>I swear, it is Christmas Eve</i> ♪

237
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,938

00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,357

00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,988
-(music stops)
-Okay, stop. Stop, stop, stop.

242
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,573
I have a better idea.

243
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,992
(all laughing)

244
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,537
Guys, you'll never guess where
I'm calling you from: work.

245
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,581
That's work?
What are we doing here?

246
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,208
Let's check it out.
I got a feeling

247
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,586
there's greener pastures
just outside this door.

248
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,757
(howling)

249
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,885
Huh, that used to be
a Baskin-Robbins.

250
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,930
♪ ♪

251
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,556
Oh, my God.

252
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,392
I'm actually happy at work.

253
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:28,396
I haven't looked at my watch
in seven minutes and 23 seconds.

254
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,315
And I'm optimistic about
our future.

255
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,275
You say that like it's
the first time.

256
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,569
Well, there was that time
I had the first number right

257
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,154
on the Powerball.

258
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,281
That was a great day.

259
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,784
Remember? 27.

260
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,786
Mm, 27.

261
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,288
I chose it because that's how
much money we had in the bank,

262
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,792
-27 cents.
-Aw.

263
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,794
Mm. Hmm?

264
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,089
Hmm. Mmm. Mm.

265
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,510
Smithers, what happened
to our workers?

266
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,012
Well, apparently, this new
self-driving car company

267
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,556
is poaching our employees.

268
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,434
They do have an excellent
LGBT policy.

269
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,810
What's that stand for--

270
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,438
lazy goof-off buffoons?
And transgender.

271
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,189
All right, Smithers,
what's say you and I

272
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,941
go undercover and check out
this company.

273
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,819
You're fluent in SQL,
Python and JavaScript.

274
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,196
Three years in
Google's A.I. division.

275
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,200
Wow. These are very impressive
résumés for 22-year-olds.

276
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,827
We're in.

277
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,663
Tugs-of-war? Iced cream?

278
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,874
(laughs)
I could never offer this.

279
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,459
You could if you just deferred

280
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,169
one-half percent
of your compensation.

281
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,171
I could never offer this.

282
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,547
(sniffs)

283
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,091
(sniffing)

284
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,552
Smithers, do you realize
how brilliant this is?

285
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,053
Instead of paying them more,

286
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,555
they make the workplace
pleasant,

287
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,600
so the employees
never want to leave.

288
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,685
I can never beat this.

289
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,272
-Sorry.
-It happens.

290
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,485
Let's go home, please.

291
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,986
Okay, here's what
I've been thinking.

292
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,113
A special day
where everyone dresses

293
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,073
like their favorite superheroes.

294
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,160
Oh, yeah.
We can make hero sandwiches.

295
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:09,705
You know what I love about
working with you? Everything.

296
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,791
(tires screech)

297
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,793
Wait a minute, this isn't home.

298
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,461
That's so weird.

299
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,671
You just mentioned
hero sandwiches.

300
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,049
It's almost like the car
was listening to us.

301
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,176
Yeah. Let's test this out.

302
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,346
Say, Marge, I could go
for some doughnuts.

303
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,139
-(tires screech)
-Hmm.

304
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,059
I'm so hungry
I could eat a horse.

305
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,895
-Mm.
-Holy crap.

306
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,984
This company is up to some kind
of monkey business.

307
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,904
There's a problem
with the driverless car.

308
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,615
(monkeys chittering)

309
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,159
Oh, there's no problem. It's our
sponsored rides program.

310
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,495
The cars passively combine
your conversations,

311
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,497
facial expressions and data
we stole from Equifax

312
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,290
to determine which of our
corporate sponsors

313
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,625
to take you to.

314
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,418
Corporate sponsors?
What the...?

315
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,046
Don't you make enough money
giving out cars for free?

316
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,049
Do you think dating sites want
you to meet other people?

317
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,218
They want your data.

318
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,178
That's what all websites want.

319
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,639
Not DataGrab.net.

320
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,932
-Yep.
-(gasps)

321
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,642
And you can't stop us.

322
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,144
When you joined, you signed
nondisclosure agreements,

323
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,855
which nobody ever reads.

324
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,942
You don't want to mess with us.

325
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,902
We have lawyers that were
crossbred with wolves.

326
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,988
Well, you prepare
to hear from a guy

327
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,615
pretending to be my lawyer,
probably Moe.

328
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,119
Now I'm gonna defiantly exit
on this moving walkway.

329
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,371
Good day.

330
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,377
I should have gotten off.

331
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,675
So, my client, uh,
Homer Simpson, is suing youse.

332
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,302
I am not a pretend attorney,

333
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,889
I am Homer's liar.
Lawyer. Good-bye.

334
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:58,898
That wasn't the kind of coke
I was talking about.

335
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,903
Ugh...

336
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,614
Seymour, you're driving
too fast.

337
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,199
Mother, it's a self-driving car.

338
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,784
Keep your eyes on the road!

339
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,828
Aw, what am I gonna
do with you?

340
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,371
(tires squeal)

341
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,415
Look, they take our insurance.

342
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,168
Marge, I can't believe
they invaded

343
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,128
the sanctity of my car.

344
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,255
I mean, what's next? Alexa?

345
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,507
ALEXA:
<i>Alexa is only here to help.</i>

Mr. Burns?
What are you doing here?

359
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,795
I don't know. I was in one
