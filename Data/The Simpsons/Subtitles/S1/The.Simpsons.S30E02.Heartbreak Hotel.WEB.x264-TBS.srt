00:00:07,663 --> 00:00:08,930
One month ago,

3
00:00:08,965 --> 00:00:11,800
12 couples arrived
on this tropical island.

4
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:14,102
After an emergency balloon landing,

5
00:00:14,136 --> 00:00:16,938
a jellyfish explosion
and the most-viewed

6
00:00:16,973 --> 00:00:20,942
cantaloupe catapult
accident of all time,

7
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:22,777
just four couples remain.

8
00:00:22,812 --> 00:00:25,880
I'm Tag Tuckerbag, and this
is the greatest adventure

9
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:28,316
to take place in just one place.

10
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:29,985
- The Amazing Place!
- The Amazing Place!

11
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:31,686
The Place Show.

12
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:35,190
The final challenge
is the Lily Pad Leap.

13
00:00:35,224 --> 00:00:38,326
They haven't done the LP
Leap since season 22,

14
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:40,095
"Beauty versus Sexy."

15
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:46,401
Kayla, don't step on the stem.
You'll flip the pad.

16
00:00:46,435 --> 00:00:49,337
You should know that.
You're a life coach.

17
00:00:51,407 --> 00:00:53,375
- They flipped the pad!
- They flipped the pad.

18
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:55,276
What a noob.

19
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:01,916
Hector and Audrey Chang, you have won

20
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:04,252
The Amazing Place!

21
00:01:04,286 --> 00:01:06,488
- Called it.
- Mom, you always call the winner.

22
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:08,089
How do you know?

23
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:10,658
Well, your father may
have Moe's and football,

24
00:01:10,693 --> 00:01:13,661
but I have being by
myself and this show.

25
00:01:13,696 --> 00:01:15,497
Do you like adventure, bandanas

26
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:17,766
and having your friends
see you melt down on TV?

27
00:01:17,768 --> 00:01:23,038
We want you for season 48
of The Amazing Place.

28
00:01:23,072 --> 00:01:25,771
Why don't you guys try
out for that show?

29
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:26,941
You would dominate.

30
00:01:26,976 --> 00:01:28,877
Oh, no, I couldn't.

31
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:30,712
You know what they say: you don't fail

32
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:33,681
at 100% of the shots you don't take.

33
00:01:33,716 --> 00:01:35,884
But you've watched every
episode of the show

34
00:01:35,918 --> 00:01:38,219
and listened to the
director commentaries.

35
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,456
You even made us play
the terrible home game.

36
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:44,926
- Come on, Mom.
- Just try out.

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,028
- Come on, try out.
- Come on.

38
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:48,663
Come on, try out.

39
00:01:48,697 --> 00:01:50,231
- Try out.
- Try out, Mom.

40
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:52,901
- Try out!
- Try out!

41
00:01:52,935 --> 00:01:54,903
- Come on, just do it, Mom!
- Come on!

42
00:01:54,937 --> 00:01:57,205
Just try out!

43
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,606
- Come on.
- Mom.

44
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:00,442
- Just try out.
- Why don't you try out?

45
00:02:00,476 --> 00:02:02,477
- Just try out.
- Come on, do it.

46
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:05,647
I'm not trying out, so just can it.

47
00:02:07,683 --> 00:02:10,285
I said "can it" to my own children.

48
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,886
What have I become?

49
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:13,655
Baby, you've got to tell them sometime.

50
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:14,889
Tell us what?

51
00:02:14,924 --> 00:02:16,424
We know all the family secrets.

52
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:17,992
Like that Dad lost our college funds

53
00:02:18,027 --> 00:02:20,995
investing in a chain of
chewing tobacco cafes.

54
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,997
Dippin' Dens was a great idea.

55
00:02:23,032 --> 00:02:25,333
We just weren't prepared
for all the spitting.

56
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:27,635
Well, I might as well come clean.

57
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:33,408
The real tragedy is now Chaw House owns

58
00:02:33,442 --> 00:02:36,845
the entire casual chewing market.

59
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:41,583
The truth is, we have tried out.

60
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:43,384
Dozens of times.

61
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:47,856
Why should you pick us
to be on The Amazing Place?

62
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,292
Because we're best friends
who never bicker.

63
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:54,996
Wee constantly at each other's throats.

64
00:02:56,332 --> 00:02:58,466
We're motorcycle bikers.

65
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,135
That's our persona.

66
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:03,304
We have no idea what you want.

67
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:05,874
Just please pick us.

68
00:03:05,908 --> 00:03:07,175
Why are you still doing this?

69
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:08,676
We were already on that show

70
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:10,979
where we had to crawl
into a drainage ditch.

71
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:13,214
That was just you, and it wasn't a show.

72
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:14,816
It was a police bodycam.

73
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,818
That was a good show.

74
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,656
After 46 rejections, I can take a hint.

75
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,691
They don't want us.

76
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:29,964
You know, reality shows
love a sob story,

77
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,401
and we've got a storage
bin full of tears.

78
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:35,537
And I've got a sister who
will edit them together

79
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:37,005
while I feed the dog marshmallows

80
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,439
and see what happens.

81
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:52,487
Ow!

82
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,057
Oh, we're not here to make friends.

83
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:59,060
Unless I meet some awesome guy
who-who wants to be my friend.

84
00:03:59,094 --> 00:04:01,896
Yeah, I met this really
cool guy at the boba place,

85
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:04,699
but he said he was moving
to Hong Kong and, uh,

86
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:06,367
he didn't know his number yet.

87
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:09,771
Every reality show needs
that crazy, no-limits guy

88
00:04:09,805 --> 00:04:12,607
that just shatters
society's taboos, right?

89
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:15,543
Well, break out your pixelation machine,

90
00:04:15,578 --> 00:04:19,948
because I am your bug-eating nude fatso.

91
00:04:19,982 --> 00:04:21,983
Oh, also, I'm not here to make friends.

92
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,955
Oh, my God, married kids?

93
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:28,189
You're in the show.

94
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:30,425
- Ew, no.
- We're here on behalf

95
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:31,893
of some different weirdos.

96
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:34,195
Our parents have tried
out for every season

97
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,730
of The Amazing Place.

98
00:04:35,764 --> 00:04:37,298
My dad would even record my mom

99
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,168
opening your letters in
case they got picked.

100
00:04:40,202 --> 00:04:41,903
Mm-hmm.

101
00:04:44,573 --> 00:04:45,740
Oh.

102
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:47,976
Oh.

103
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,881
So think what a magical
TV moment it would be

104
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,718
for our mom to find out
she made it on the show.

105
00:04:56,752 --> 00:04:58,419
After losing all hope.

106
00:04:58,454 --> 00:05:00,922
When she didn't even know she applied.

107
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:03,791
The ultimate superfan
gets one last chance

108
00:05:03,826 --> 00:05:06,227
to make her dreams come true.

109
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:08,730
I don't know, it sounds
a little manipulative.

110
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:10,231
You're fired.

111
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,667
I think we just found our Boston Rob.

112
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:15,737
Or your Springfield Clancy.

113
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:17,605
Huh? Huh?

114
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:21,743
Electric bill, past due,

115
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:24,612
Website renewal "DippinDens.com."

116
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:25,980
What's this?

117
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:29,417
"Congratulations, Marge
and Homer Simpson.

118
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:31,419
You have been selected to compete on..."

119
00:05:31,453 --> 00:05:32,787
The Amazing Place!

120
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:35,657
Tag Tuckerbag?

121
00:05:35,691 --> 00:05:37,025
Tag Buggernut?

122
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:38,993
This is it. After years of rejection,

123
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:41,429
you two will finally compete
for a million dollars

124
00:05:41,463 --> 00:05:43,431
on The Amazing Place.

125
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:45,466
But we didn't even try out.

126
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:47,602
I edited together your old auditions.

127
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:49,837
And I gave notes which were ignored.

128
00:05:51,507 --> 00:05:54,842
My crazy dream is coming true.

129
00:05:54,877 --> 00:05:57,612
After you sign the amazing waivers.

130
00:05:57,646 --> 00:05:59,781
So many ways to die.

131
00:05:59,815 --> 00:06:03,818
Falling off rocks, rocks falling on me.

132
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:05,887
Toxoplasmosis?

133
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:08,356
That's what ate Handsome Tom's face.

134
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,725
Just call me Handsome Homer.

135
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,262
- Bye, Mom!
- Don't get toxoplasmosis!

136
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,501
Welcome to The Amazing Place.

137
00:06:20,536 --> 00:06:23,137
You're about to embark on a
test of mental toughness,

138
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:25,006
physical strength and interviews
where you have to pretend

139
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,641
that you're in the middle of a challenge

140
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:28,543
when it's already over.

141
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:32,480
But first, let's kick things off
with a romantic beachside luau

142
00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:34,649
at Lover's Lagoon.

143
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:38,152
Right after your first challenge.

144
00:06:38,187 --> 00:06:40,221
We took one item from every person's bag

145
00:06:40,255 --> 00:06:42,657
and hid it in another
contestant's luggage.

146
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:46,961
Everyone, find their
Suitcase Stowaway now.

147
00:06:46,995 --> 00:06:49,497
It's the ultimate Tarmac Unpack Attack.

148
00:06:49,531 --> 00:06:51,532
Okay, Suitcase Stowaway.

149
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,568
They've done this three times before.

150
00:06:53,602 --> 00:06:56,204
Here's the secret: dump and dig.

151
00:06:56,238 --> 00:06:59,941
I found my stowaway.

152
00:06:59,975 --> 00:07:02,977
Great. Go through my other bag.

153
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:09,917
Okay, Homie, don't panic.

154
00:07:09,952 --> 00:07:12,353
The secret is to just
take your time, and...

155
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,526
I'm sorry, Homer and
Marge, you've been...

156
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,862
- Don't say it.
- shell-iminated.

157
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:22,363
No, no. No, no, no.

158
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:24,332
We can't be the first couple kicked off.

159
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:26,934
That's the ultimate humiliation.

160
00:07:32,307 --> 00:07:34,475
I never even put on a swimsuit.

161
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,078
I never got to see the lagoon.

162
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:40,348
I'm crying, and no one's
even filming me.

163
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,085
We didn't even make it off the tarmac.

164
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:48,271
All because of my screwup.

165
00:07:48,271 --> 00:07:49,605
I guess we're going home.

166
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,273
No, you're going there.

167
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:53,776
Huh?

168
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,578
A hotel? But we lost.

169
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:57,847
If we let you go home
now, fans would know

170
00:07:57,881 --> 00:08:00,382
you've been kicked off
before the season airs.

171
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:03,385
So ejected contestants
must stay at this hotel

172
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,888
until every epise is finished taping.

173
00:08:05,922 --> 00:08:08,457
So we can't go home for a month?

174
00:08:08,492 --> 00:08:10,392
Six weeks, counting post.

175
00:08:10,427 --> 00:08:12,628
I don't know what post is.

176
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:15,897
Hey, save some of those
tears for the reunion show.

177
00:08:15,897 --> 00:08:19,653
You'll just put us in the back
row and won't ask any questions.

178
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:21,720
We won't even get to hug the winner.

179
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:23,856
Yeah, but the runner-up's
always wandering around

180
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,524
looking for someone to hug.

181
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,759
That's your play.

182
00:08:28,194 --> 00:08:30,663
How could I be such a noob?

183
00:08:30,697 --> 00:08:33,666
I could learn to love
a noob, given time.

184
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,751
I already miss the kids.

185
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:38,153
Well, there's got to be
a way we can call home

186
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:39,788
without getting in trouble.

187
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,955
If you say anything
that reveals or implies

188
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,923
that you have been ejected
from The Amazing Place,

189
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,526
you are subject to a fine
of up to a million dollars

190
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,962
and, for residents of Georgia,
the death penalty.

191
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,399
Kids, kids, how are you?

192
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:54,968
Lisa said I can't use the bubble bath,

193
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,603
but you said you bought
it for everybody.

194
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,071
Forget the bubble bath.

195
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,138
How's the show?

196
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:00,240
Are you winning?

197
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,842
Um, I'm not supposed to say.

198
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,077
That means you're dominating.

199
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,578
I knew it!

200
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:06,779
No, no, we're not dominating.

201
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:09,415
I didn't reveal or imply that.

202
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,417
Well, you can't have
gotten kicked off yet.

203
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:13,019
You just got there.

204
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:16,789
Mmm...

205
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,359
"Your mother and I are excited

206
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,594
to be part of the Amazing Place family.

207
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:23,796
All further inquiries should
be submitted in writing

208
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:26,799
to Don DiBusco Productions,
Burbank, California."

209
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,635
What the hell are you talking about?

210
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,436
This conversation is hereby terminated.

211
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:33,139
You are each entitled to
one capful of bubble bath.

212
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,611
Now, that's parenting.

213
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:40,513
Come on, baby, it's not so bad.

214
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:42,348
Really?

215
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:48,021
Six weeks away from the kids,
Grampa, my sisters, your job.

216
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:51,491
With nothing to do but
eat free room service

217
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,894
and watch dopey movies on
demand while they keep us quiet

218
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:57,630
with an endless supply of free booze.

219
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,232
It's a nightmare.

220
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,835
It is. It truly is.

221
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,047
You see, Curtis, you never really

222
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,349
get an episode of SportsCenter

223
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,851
until you've seen it for the third time.

224
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:21,154
Can I freshen up that
appetizer platter for you?

225
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,990
Nah, I better go check in on my wife.

226
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:27,026
She's having a hard time
adjusting to hotel living.

227
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,900
Just let me clean.

228
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:40,073
Sweetie, I'm worried about you.

229
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,741
You just sit around all day changing

230
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:43,676
the combination on the room safe.

231
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:46,012
Do you want to put something
in the room safe?

232
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,847
I don't deserve valuables.

233
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,949
It's my fault we're stuck here.

234
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:51,784
All I deserve is to sit alone

235
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,887
and watch the TV channel
that's about the hotel.

236
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:56,923
Forgot your toothbrush? No problem.

237
00:10:56,957 --> 00:11:00,893
Sundries gift shop has all the
toiletries every traveler needs.

238
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:03,963
Sundries is awesome.
I got this shirt there.

239
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:06,733
Look, I know you're miserable,

240
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,702
but let me show you how
great this place can be.

241
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:12,305
It's just a stupid chain hotel.

242
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:16,442

whose title doesn't appear on the bill?

266
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:32,719
Maybe being trapped here isn't so bad.

267
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,521
I'm not even worried about
what the kids are up to.

268
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:39,792
- Come on, dig. Dig.
- We're hot.

269
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:42,261
You can go for a nice, cool swim

270
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:44,197
after you finish digging my pool.

271
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,799
I'm telling Patty and
Selma what you're doing.

272
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,668
What? We want a pool.

273
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,737
I just got my first wax in years.

274
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,406
Hurt so much they had
to give me an epidural.

275
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,878
Haw-haw!

276
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:03,149
The fitness center only
had an old NordicTrack,

277
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,051
but it felt good to work out.

278
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:07,854
I sat on a yoga ball and
drank cucumber water.

279
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:10,256
It's nice to know I can still do that.

280
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,325
Mm, maybe we should peek in.

281
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,528
I am kind of curious to see
what's going on in the show.

282
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,530
Really? You sure you can handle it?

283
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:18,792
Oh, yeah.

284
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:23,029
I'm still in a great mood after
reading that free USA Today.

285
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:27,874
Look, they're editing our episode.

286
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:31,043
There I am, looking for
that Suitcase Stowaway.

287
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:33,379
I never found it, did I?

288
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,015
Great. Go through my other bag.

289
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:39,719
Hey, that's me looking for that thing.

290
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:42,455
Okay. Marge's vitamins, Marge's pajamas,

291
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,090
Marge's giant chocolate bar.

292
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,793
I didn't pack a giant chocolate bar.

293
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,429
What Marge doesn't know

294
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:53,733
is that her husband just ate
her Suitcase Stowaway.

295
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:56,969
This ultimate "didgeri-don't"
will send them packing.

296
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,171
Whoa!

297
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:01,574
I'm not the one who screwed up. You are.

298
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:02,975
I'm so sorry.

299
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,443
I know you're gonna need some space,

300
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:06,078
so I'll sleep on the couch.

301
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:48,873
What a dump.

302
00:14:48,873 --> 00:14:50,640
What's that from?

303
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:52,876
- What?
- "What a dump."

304
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,214
How would I know?

305
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:57,248
We wouldn't be in this dump
if you weren't such a flop.

306
00:14:57,684 --> 00:14:59,685
I'm tired, dear. It's late.

307
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:01,854
A chocolate flop.

308
00:15:01,888 --> 00:15:04,156
Yes, a chocolate flop.

309
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,292
That's what you keep
braying at everybody.

310
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:07,760
I don't bray!

311
00:15:07,794 --> 00:15:10,029
All right, you don't bray.

312
00:15:10,063 --> 00:15:12,498
I do not bray!

313
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:14,066
I said you didn't bray.

314
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,301
Make me a drink.

315
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:17,503
- Haven't you had enough?
- Make me a drink.

316
00:15:17,537 --> 00:15:20,472
Yes, dear.

317
00:15:20,507 --> 00:15:23,309
And lay out some mixed nuts.
We've got guests.

318
00:15:23,343 --> 00:15:26,478
- We've got what?
- Guests. Guests!

319
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:28,147
You know, what's-their-names.

320
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:29,348
I don't know their names.

321
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:31,317
They just got eliminated from the show.

322
00:15:31,351 --> 00:15:34,820
It took them five weeks,
not five minutes.

323
00:15:36,656 --> 00:15:38,023
Go answer the door.

324
00:15:38,058 --> 00:15:40,392
All right, love, whatever love wants.

325
00:15:40,427 --> 00:15:43,195
Get the door. The door!

326
00:15:43,229 --> 00:15:44,530
I'm getting the door.

327
00:15:44,564 --> 00:15:47,166
You don't have to bray
like some subhuman monster.

328
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,934
Oh, go to hell!

329
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:55,040
Hi! Hi, there. Come on in.

330
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:57,509
- This is, um...
- Honey.

331
00:15:57,544 --> 00:15:59,578
And this is Nick.

332
00:15:59,612 --> 00:16:01,981
Oh, I thought his name
was what's-his-name.

333
00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:04,249
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

334
00:16:04,284 --> 00:16:06,418
Just ignore Homer, old sourpuss.

335
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:07,853
That's me.

336
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:10,823
Hey, sourpuss, why don't
you mix them a drink?

337
00:16:10,857 --> 00:16:12,224
Yes, dear.

338
00:16:15,428 --> 00:16:16,862
I love your room.

339
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:18,864
We have the exact same paintings.

340
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:26,605
You were this close to winning
The Three-Legged Chase.

341
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,377
You were right in ther Nick,
right at the meat of things.

342
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:33,379
There's no limit to you, is there?

343
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:36,181
And how would you have played
the Three-Legged Chase?

344
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:38,283
Why don't I show you?

345
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:41,787
- Don't encourage her.
- Encourage me.

346
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:51,063
Inside, outside, inside, outside,

347
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:55,067
in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out.

348
00:16:57,003 --> 00:16:59,038
You can sit around with the minibar gin

349
00:16:59,072 --> 00:17:00,572
runninout of your mouth.

350
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:03,942
You can tear me apart like the
box the shower cap came in.

351
00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:06,378
That's perfectly okay, that's all right.

352
00:17:06,413 --> 00:17:08,147
You can stand it.

353
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:09,748
I cannot stand it!

354
00:17:09,783 --> 00:17:11,550
You can stand it

355
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:13,886
You married me for it.

356
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,122
- Our son is dead.
- No, he isn't.

357
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:19,792
- We have no son!
- Yes, we do!

358
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:22,428
Oh, yeah, Bart.

359
00:17:23,797 --> 00:17:26,598
Man, last night sure
was a searing portrait

360
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,434
of a marriage in turmoil.

361
00:17:28,468 --> 00:17:32,771
It's still in turmoil, you
chocolate-gobbling dream killer.

362
00:17:32,806 --> 00:17:36,809
Attention, everyone, gather
by the bowl of mini yogurts.

363
00:17:36,843 --> 00:17:39,311
For the first time ever
on The Amazing Place,

364
00:17:39,345 --> 00:17:42,014
two eliminated contestants
will be brought back

365
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:43,582
to compete in the finale.

366
00:17:44,984 --> 00:17:47,019
But here's the catch, to get back in,

367
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:49,922
you have to dump your loved
one for another partner.

368
00:17:49,956 --> 00:17:51,790
So, if your spouse screwed up,

369
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:53,926
this is your chance to cut them loose.

370
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,161
It's the Dead Weight Drop.

371
00:17:58,031 --> 00:18:00,833
I choose Nick.

372
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:02,601
That's got to sting, Homer.

373
00:18:02,635 --> 00:18:04,636
I'm just glad my friends and family

374
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,739
are never going to see
me humiliated like this.

375
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:14,179
This is it, the final challenge:

376
00:18:14,214 --> 00:18:15,881
Mango Tango.

377
00:18:15,881 --> 00:18:18,684
First, pick and peel enough fresh mango

378
00:18:18,718 --> 00:18:20,786
to make six mango-ritas,

379
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,989
which you must then carry
across a log bridge.

380
00:18:24,023 --> 00:18:27,960
But under the bridge is a pack
of mango-loving monkeys,

381
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:29,361
which can only be soothed

382
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:31,964
with music played on a pennywhistle.

383
00:18:31,998 --> 00:18:34,500
Also, there will be a Kia
Sportage in the background

384
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:36,969
that we couldn't figure out
how to fit into the challenge.

385
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:40,072
Your Mango Tango starts now.

386
00:18:40,106 --> 00:18:42,641
And Marge draws first fruit.

387
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,611
I'll make the mango-ritas.

388
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:47,146
Great teamwork.

389
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,882
Could this be a million-dollar puree?

390
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,417
I'll handle those monkeys.

391
00:18:58,391 --> 00:19:01,460
It's the ultimate
groovy chill-out flute jam.

392
00:19:01,494 --> 00:19:04,329
Look, the monkeys are mellowing.

393
00:19:04,364 --> 00:19:07,599
This is our Kia Sporge Moment.

394
00:19:09,936 --> 00:19:11,336
I did it.

395
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:13,805
We won. Without Homer.

396
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:17,242
Marge and Nick,

397
00:19:17,277 --> 00:19:20,512
I want to congratulate you
on winning The Amazing Place.

398
00:19:20,547 --> 00:19:22,848
- Yay!
- I want to, but I can't.

399
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:28,353
Because you failed to salt
the rims of your mango-ritas,

400
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:31,757
rendering them mango-nothings.

401
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,793
I screwed up a recipe?

402
00:19:34,827 --> 00:19:38,330
So get out of the way of the
actual winners, Shawn and Barry.

403
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:39,464
Hey!

404
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:42,634
Our rims are super salty.

405
00:19:46,372 --> 00:19:48,373
Hey! Hey, hey, come on. Oh!

406
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:51,944
I am such a noob.

407
00:19:53,146 --> 00:19:56,048
I am such a noob.

408
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:58,450
What a noob.

409
00:19:58,484 --> 00:20:00,786
- Total noob.
- Classic noob.

410
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,723
Homie, I was such a jerk.
How can I make it up to you?

411
00:20:04,757 --> 00:20:07,292
Sweetheart, you already have.

412
00:20:07,327 --> 00:20:09,795
I am such a noob.

413
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:14,233
I've screwed up so many
times in our marriage,

414
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:17,169
and people always feel so sorry for you.

415
00:20:17,203 --> 00:20:21,073
But with this epic noob blunder,
I'm the one they pity.

416
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:25,177
Oh... pity. Oh...

417
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:27,412
Is this how you feel all the time?

418
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:30,983
Uh, kind of. I just never
let myself enjoy it.

419
00:20:31,017 --> 00:20:34,386
Oh, pity feels good.

420
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:40,216
