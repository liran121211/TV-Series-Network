00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,640
Huh?

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,520
Huh?

4
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,380
Rats!

5
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,279
Hey, is there someone in the restaurant?

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,360
Oh, yeah.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,879
Aw, he looks scared.

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,080
Can we keep him? Can we keep him?

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,240
No.

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,760
We'll name him Bob Number One.

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,200
And, Dad, you can just
go by Bob Number Two,

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,706
or maybe no name at all.

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,200
Wait. Why would I be Bob
Number Two or no name?

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,330
- I am Bob.
- Well, yeah, but this is Bob,

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,240
so now we're, like, Bob and Bob.

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,816
- I don't like it.
- You can't just name a guy Bob.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,080
Yeah, you can. Somebody did it to you.

18
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,620
- That's true.
- Bob Number Two is

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,140
throwing out some major 'tude right now.

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,260
- Isn't he, though?
- Yeah, lose the 'tude.

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,159
It is kind of nice to have
someone in the restaurant.

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,050
- Yeah.
- What's he doing?

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,450
If he's robbing us,
I feel sorry for him.

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,300
No. Don't say that. We're fun to rob.

25
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,876
Maybe he's just looking
for the bathroom.

26
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,180
You're overthinking it, bro!

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,330
Just go anywhere! I'll clean it up!

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,699
No way.

29
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,540
♪ In Heaven! ♪

30
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,580
Where is everybody?

31
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,550
Didn't we just build a whole
new mixed-use complex

32
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,120
for the baby boomers?

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,920
Ugh.

34
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,260
_

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,080
I'm just following the
admissions criteria.

36
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,560
Can't we just tweak them a bit?

37
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,140
It's easier to get in to
Upper West Side preschools.

38
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,770
All we're getting up here
are little old ladies

39
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,200
and Promise Keepers.

40
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,060
Have you accepted the Lord?

41
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,280
I'm here, dimwit.

42
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,620
Frankly, those guys weird me out.

43
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,939
We have interesting people.

44
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,639
Look, Tracy Morgan's here.

45
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,040
Tracy, what are you doing here?

46
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,640
- You're all better.
- Nobody tells me these things!

47
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,760
- You gonna stop that?
- Eh, it'll stop on its own.

48
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,200
We've got to get more people in here.

49
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,940
Ned Flanders is about to
talk about that very topic.

50
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,440
_

51
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,080
Do the people my daddy
shoots go to Heaven?

52
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,880
They do if they haven't
done anything wrong.

53
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,460
So, a lot of them, yes.

54
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,819
Come on, kids, think about it.

55
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,780
Why do people get into Heaven?

56
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,590
Clayton Kersh...

57
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,660
_

58
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,120
Well, nobody said Sunday
school kids were geniuses.

59
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,940
Kids, there's only one way into Heaven.

60
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,390
Never stray from the
path of righteousness.

61
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,740
Easy for you to say.

62
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,640
With a mustache like that,
you're an obvious narc.

63
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,110
The truth is, this mustache is a memento

64
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,240
of the awful sinner I used to be.

65
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,619
I was raised with no religion.

66
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,569
Our house was a den of bebop.

67
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,300
Neddy, you're coloring inside the lines.

68
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,620
Rules are for fools, man!

69
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,160
That's right, baby.

70
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,320
Be free! Be free!

71
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,940
Go off the page. Write on the wall.

72
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,600
Color a cloud purple.

73
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,530
Jack and Jill are on the pill, man!

74
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,639
Godless and Maudeless,

75
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,220
each job I took became more depraved.

76
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,300
Finally, I became one of
the most iniquitous men

77
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,239
that ever blew a wrapper off a straw:

78
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,860
door-to-door salesmen.

79
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,120
Now, here's how I move
these Karpet Kings.

80
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,840
I make my pitch, then I start
crying, bawling like a baby.

81
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,600
The trick is I'm secretly
clinically depressed.

82
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,660
Haven't thought of that.

83
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,470
Not bad.

84
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,570
Slices of pie all around, Mabel!

85
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,340
So, rookie, your first day.

86
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,580
What do they have you
pushing, water beds?

87
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,410
Well, I am reaching for the stars

88
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,880
with Vertebreaker trampolines!

89
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,220
- What's so funny?
- They got you slingin' springs!

90
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,590
The kid's a hop jockey.

91
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,040
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

92
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,899
I know someone who sold
two of those tot tossers.

93
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,320
In his whole career!

94
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,950
What those door-to-door ding-dongs

95
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,370
didn't count on was a little
extracurricular activity

96
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,200
during Apollo 14.

97
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,540
Whee!

98
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,120
Over.

99
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,979
- Whee!
- Over.

100
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,690
America caught bounce fever.

101
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,770
Trampolines were just what
people were looking for

102
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,520
to forget the long quagmire
that was Gunsmoke.

103
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,380
_

104
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,430
Before I knew it, I was
the king of springs.

105
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,300
But after spring comes the fall.

106
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,670
Mabel! A slice of pie
for all my friends!

107
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,960
Better yet, leave the tin.

108
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,720
- Well!
- Well, how about that!

109
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,860
Big man, are ya? Real big man.

110
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,160
Well, big man, I got a headline for ya.

111
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,880
They just found out those
things are a death trap.

112
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,139
Oh, sure, there's broken
bones, concussions,

113
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,380
the occasional kid who goes
up and never comes down,

114
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,040
but I wouldn't call them a death trap.

115
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,450
I mean electrocution, smart guy.

116
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,760
Those little angel makers
you've been slingin'

117
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,700
generate static electricity
with every bounce.

118
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,020
The mats are made of birthday
balloon rubber and cat hair.

119
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,060
If you get to 500 bounces,
zappo! French-fried kid.

120
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,530
I've put innocent lives in danger.

121
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,140
And my sales pitch strongly
implied that wouldn't happen.

122
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,270
Eh, that's the game we're in.

123
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,140
If you don't like death, get
out of children's toys.

124
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,760
_

125
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,350
I've got to stop him!

126
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,100
401... 402...

127
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,240
Wow! I knew he could bounce,

128
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,580
but I had no idea he could count.

129
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,180
412... 413...

130
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,550
Oh, the brake pedal won't go down!

131
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,779
Why did I get these
super shag floor mats?

132
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,790
Why?!

133
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,140
_

134
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,440
495...

135
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,280
496...

136
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,160
497... 498...

137
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,610
499...

138
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,320
- Jesus.
- 'Sup?

139
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,120
Lord? Why am I here?

140
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,020
Uh, Ned Flanders, you
have been a sinner,

141
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,470
but you have taken the first
step on the road to redemption,

142
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,720
and if you accept the word
of the Lord... that's me...

143
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,160
I shall return you to Earth to
carry forth my word of hope.

144
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,560
And, uh, like that.

145
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,020
Jimi Hendrix is here for
your guitar lesson.

146
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,620
Hey, man. You been
practicing what I told you?

147
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,860
Uh, yeah, uh, I meant to,

148
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,620
but, uh, I lost the pick in the hole.

149
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,840
- Of the guitar?
- Oh. I wish.

150
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,040
I don't care, baby. Jimi
gets paid either way.

151
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,860
_

152
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,320
Praise the Lord, I am reborn!

153
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,510
It's a miracle! He
recovered without help!

154
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,640
In retrospect, I should have tried CPR.

155
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,510
Well, I'm a believer.

156
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,940
Come on, fellas, let's
go spread the good word.

157
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,380
God is alive!

158
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,200
Anyone need a vacuum?

159
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,000
God gave me a second chance,

160
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,980
and as a sign of his mercy,
he permanently scarred

161
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,740
my beautiful, beautiful philtrum.

162
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,120
Whoa!

163
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,430
And that's why I'm wearing this
mustache till I'm just ash.

164
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,500
It wasn't till God seriously deformed me

165
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,000
that I fully understood his love.

166
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,120
So, Ned Flanders gets into Heaven.

167
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,610
It'll be interesting to see
which wife he goes with.

168
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,380
Eh, either way, it'll be tough sledding.

169
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,900
Well you know Lord, if you
want more people here,

170
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,999
there's a category
you're not considering.

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,980
People who bring their dogs on planes

172
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,920
and say they're therapy pets?

173
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,420
I can hear you.

174
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,670
Oh, and nice to meet you, finally.

175
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,960
So, you made me in your image.

176
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,410
Well, it's like looking in a mirror.

177
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,480
- Not!
- Who did that?

178
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,610
- It wasn't me.
- Oh, you traitor!

179
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,060
Actually, I'm talking about people

180
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,900
who don't believe in God
but are still righteous.

181
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,660
- I'm talking about atheists, Lord.
- Atheists?

182
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,040
I refuse to believe they exist.

183
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,340
Well, they do. Maybe they
deserve a place here, too.

184
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,700
I'd like to talk about someone
who should be in Heaven:

185
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,920
my grandmother.

186
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,400
My grandmother's 36, and she's
got eight grandchildren.

187
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,560
Strong woman.

188
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,040
My grandmother was an atheist.

189
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,320
I'll just flip this.

190
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,480
Her name was Genevieve.

191
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,880
- _
- She lived in occupied France

192
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,420
in the darkest days of World War Two.

193
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,160
And she no longer believed in God.

194
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,419
♪ He's in the afterlife,
punishing heavily ♪

195
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,490
♪ He's the boogie woogie
Christian God of John 3:16 ♪

196
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,080
♪ A root, a toot, just
don't eat his fruit ♪

197
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,140
♪ He was born in a barn ♪

198
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,730
♪ He loved religion. ♪

199
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,480
How could a god allow
this awful war to happen?

200
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,616
I stopped a thousand wars
that would've been worse.

201
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,460
Nobody ever talks about that.

202
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,950
Perhaps her mélancolie
came from her marriage

203
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,440
to the village's most
notorious Nazi collaborator.

204
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,490
Bonjour, bonjour, Commandant!

205
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,320
And may I say, you put
the "ja" in "jawohl!"

206
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,630
Ah, my dear wife. I'm
just here collaborating,

207
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,240
mixing in a little treason.

208
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,240
You know, stuff that'll look really bad

209
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,800
in a documentary if we lose.

210
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,539
Now, with business booming,

211
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,360
you can no longer deny your husband

212
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,570
the sweet fruits of marriage.

213
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,570
Mmm, oh, yeah, yeah.

214
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,810
I'm hooked. Mmm.

215
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,580
Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh, yeah.

216
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,699
Kissing with your eyes
closed never goes awry.

217
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,779
Ever.

218
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:51,200
Why did I marry the model
for the town gargoyle? Ugh!

219
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,540
Quiet.

220
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,960
Qui est là? Qui! Qui!

221
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,440
We're U.S. paratroops.

222
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,810
We've been roaming the countryside

223
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,900
disguised as French farmers.

224
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,120
You must leave now. My
husband is a collaborator.

225
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,250
Well, I've got a screenplay

226
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,850
I've been looking for
someone to help me write.

227
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,080
Not that kind.

228
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,750
If he just gets something on
the page, that's progress.

229
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
Germans.

230
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,780
We're cooked. Worse than the
Cubs in the '32 Series.

231
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,459
I'm not a sports guy.

232
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,260
Do you have an art metaphor?

233
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,620
We'll be chopped up worse
than a Picasso nude!

234
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,240
Now my alarm is palpable!

235
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,400
What are you gonna do,
help us or turn us in?

236
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,660
Because I don't believe
there is a God above,

237
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,920
we must make our own Heaven down below.

238
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,480
Ah!

239
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,800
Hurry now!

240
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,610
- Do we get tips?
- Not in Europe.

241
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,920
Damn it. Now I know what
we're fighting for.

242
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,260
Quoi?!

243
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,650
Ooh-la-la! Dinner is served.

244
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,420
What an odd accent.

245
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,920
Are you really French?

246
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,360
Stinking customers!

247
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,560
You can't ask me personal questions.

248
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,940
Ah, you are French.

249
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,520
American fool. They'll
see right through you.

250
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,879
You don't know the first thing

251
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,640
about world-class dinner service.

252
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,279
Now listen here. I know we
may not look like much,

253
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,020
but when a fish knife needs
to be placed just so,

254
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,420
they're the mugs you want.

255
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,590
I am your, um, uh...

256
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,080
How do you say "sommelier" in French?

257
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,530
Café Meaux. Meaux speaking.

258
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,536
I'd like to speak to Monsieur Pants,

259
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,630
- first name Pierre.
- Un moment.

260
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,180
Pierre Pants? Pierre Pants?!

261
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,280
Oh, come on, anyone in
this joint Pee Your Pants?

262
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,240
Heil humor!

263
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,810
Laughing is for Germans only.

264
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,340
Ow!

265
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,320
Now, precisely what part
of France are you from?

266
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,850
Eh... Normandy beach.

267
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,540
You know, where the invasion's coming.

268
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,920
We must warn our Panzers!

269
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,380
We got to stop 'em, but how?

270
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,920

nothing, except my country.

you can take my wife.

No, you can't!

282
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,050
Oh. Well, the marriage counselor said

283
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,610
we should try to find a
common interest, so, uh...

284
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,590
_

285
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,619
Oh, Meaux, I am so sorry

286
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,529
I ever made you kiss a fish.

287
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,820
That was a fish?

288
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,060
But this isn't.

289
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,770
Mmm.

290
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,160
There's more in the bedroom.

291
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,320
We have a bedroom?

292
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,640
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

293
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:36,680
So, it goes to show atheists
can do great things, too.

294
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,840
All right, I agree.

295
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,060
We will open Heaven to
the deserving atheists.

296
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,540
And if you let them in,
there are a few mistakes

297
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,380
I'd recommend getting rid of.

298
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,220
Christopher Columbus.

299
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,690
Hey, what are you two talking about?

300
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,459
Nothing. What are you doing here?

301
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,530
I was looking for a quicker
route to the bathroom,

302
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,830
and I got lost.

303
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,480
- Oh, it's him.
- Hey, dudes.

304
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,280
Who wants to rub my belly?

305
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,240
Now, why don't you consider
other faiths for your Heaven?

306
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,040
Like, oh... I don't know...
the way of the Buddha?

307
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,360
I say no shirt, no shoes, no salvation.

308
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,360
I say we have Lisa Simpson.

309
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,260
Well, there is redemption,
and there are good works.

310
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,920
But there is another path.

311
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,000
A path to enlightenment
without ego or possessions.

312
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,080
I don't know. Jesus is pretty fond

313
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,370
of that plus sign he's
always carrying around.

314
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,370
Let me share the Buddhist path to Heaven

315
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,380
with an enlightened tale I call

316
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,280
"The Princess Not
Affiliated With Disney."

317
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,350
Unless we are now owned by Disney.

318
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,350
In the sixth century B.C.,

319
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,740
or zero in the Buddhist calendar...

320
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,700
Oh, you have your own calendar.

321
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,800
What's today, the fifth of Bibbity-boo?

322
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,760
... zero in the Buddhist calendar,

323
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,140
lived the spoiled Princess Siddmartha.

324
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,520
Siddmartha, sweetie,
look what we got you.

325
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,660
Oh. A pony.

326
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,400
50 ponies!

327
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,770
Oh. Somehow 50 ponies

328
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,600
- seem less than one.
- Oh.

329
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,720
The princess wondered, if
nothing was denied her,

330
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,540
why was she not satisfied?

331
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,080
Why couldn't she be
happy like her brother

332
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,900
with his stupid multiplayer games?

333
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,860
Brother, do you not grow
weary of this opulence?

334
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,270
Sometimes, but there's
always the decadence.

335
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,039
There must be a middle path

336
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,620
between opulence and decadence.

337
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,780
Flatulence?

338
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,040
No.

339
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,420
Please, somebody, think
of the elephants!

340
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,900
Princess Siddmartha, hmm,

341
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,020
perhaps the stars hold the
answer to your questions.

342
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,520
Why don't you take a look?

343
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,260
Meh.

344
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,839
Those children have nothing,

345
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,600
but they're enjoying themselves.

346
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,990
Maybe all these riches have blinded me

347
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,540
to what really matters:

348
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,600
goats' heads. Hmm.

349
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,080
That's mine.

Oops.

367
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,480
Disguised as a poor boy,
Siddmartha sought out

368
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,920
the most learned
scholars in the kingdom.

369
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,120
But she soon learned

370
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,260
Kathmandu U, like Budhanilkantha Tech,

371
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,060
was just another party school.

372
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,260
_

373
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,920
Excuse me.

374
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,330
You're wasting your lives, man.

375
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,679
It's the year zero.

376
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,720
How much is there to learn?

377
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,000
Come on, girl. Let's find inner peace.

378
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,839
I will sit under this Bodhi Tree

379
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,980
because I am void of ideas.

380
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,450
So, Siddmartha sat and
sat and sat and sat,

381
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,780
willing to wait forever and a day

382
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,220
until she found enlightenment.

383
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,560

384
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,460
♪ Om... ♪

385
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,460

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,450
Namaste!

387
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,880
Even though she strayed from
our faith, I'm proud of Lisa.

388
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,200
That Buddhist kid's a
really good person.

389
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,560
What? I'm just sayin'.

390
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,200
Mm, if we've learned anything

391
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,620
from these three
tangentially-related stories,

392
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,200
it's that there are
many paths to Heaven.

393
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,340
Maybe we should let everybody in.

394
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,579
Great idea.

395
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,350
I decree that all with
good souls are welcome

396
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,680
in Heaven now and forever.

397
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,040
How did I get here?

398
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,390
Well, you see, you were
Smithers' plus one.

399
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,290
I demand to get in on my own merits.

400
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,320
I'll talk to him.

401
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,440
Don't be scared, boys.

402
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,940
That's just angels bowling.

403
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,480
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

404
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,700
- Oh, we consider it a blessing.
- Kiss-up.
