1
00:00:01,619 --> 00:00:05,006
"The Great Wife Hope"

2
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:03,634
Yes!

3
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:08,967
Oh, Marge, how did you ever come up
with an idea like "crazy bowling"?

4
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:10,733
I Googled

5
00:02:10,734 --> 00:02:13,967
"Girls having fun," and after wading
through 97,000 pages of porn,

6
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,500
I found "crazy bowling."

7
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:18,233
Hmm, that's odd.

8
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:20,801
There isn't a single man in
this whole bowling alley.

9
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,868
The pin!

10
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,800
It's pretty sad when I can't pick up a guy
on super nacho Tuesday.

11
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:35,333
Where'd they all go?

12
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:39,167
Oh, you know men-- probably
at a baseball game or a bar.

13
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,967
Come on, you pansies!

14
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:14,733
I've seen fiercer fights
in parliament!

15
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:18,433
Yes, what is this, prime
minister's question time?

16
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:19,734
Yeah, is it that?

17
00:03:37,808 --> 00:03:41,767
There's no better violence
than self-inflicted violence.

18
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:45,567
Thanks for bringing
me here, dad.

19
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:47,520
I'll remember this
day on my deathbed.

20
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:51,966
Not everyone has a deathbed, son.
You could die suddenly.

21
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:56,421
Wow. Maybe some punk kid will
shoot me to get into a gang.

22
00:03:56,422 --> 00:03:58,021
Maybe.

23
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,400
Three hours of half-naked
guys fighting like animals.

24
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:04,333
Just like the
ancient romans.

25
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah, except their empire
was falling apart.

26
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,367
Stupid romans.

27
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:12,500
Ask him.

28
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:16,451
Sir, could you sign my
program with a swear word?

29
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:20,999
Uh, yes, filthy but obscure with
a subtle scatological undertone.

30
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,167
Sure, no problem.
$25, please.

31
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:24,368
Pay the man, boy.

32
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,266
Now, listen, son,

33
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,799
I know we saw some awesome
beat-downs tonight,

34
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,767
but remember:
Don't try this at home.

35
00:04:32,768 --> 00:04:34,466
Do it at the schoolyard.

36
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:38,367
Someplace where, if you get
hurt, we can sue not just them

37
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:42,334
but the school, the county, the state,
and that jackass Joe Biden.

38
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:47,266
Python neck clinch
and... Out.

39
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:50,433
Maybe I was promoted to
green belt too early.

40
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:52,334
Next victim.

41
00:04:57,496 --> 00:04:59,401
Here we go.

42
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:04,334
Where's your brother?

43
00:05:04,335 --> 00:05:07,334
I don't know,
chasing ducks, buried alive?

44
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:10,434
He'll be missed.
Let's move, I got to collect pine cones.

45
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,234
Die, die, die!

46
00:05:12,235 --> 00:05:15,022
Just follow
the dies, mom.

47
00:05:19,294 --> 00:05:21,367
Why me?

48
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:22,800
Why me?!

49
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:24,367
Bart Simpson!

50
00:05:24,368 --> 00:05:26,980
I'm glad your father
isn't here to see this.

51
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:28,481
Kill, kill, kill, kill!

52
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:32,501
Kill, kill, kill, kill!

53
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:33,934
Kill, kill, kill, kill!

54
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:35,568
Bart, let him go.

55
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:36,867
But mom, I'm winning.

56
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:38,980
Look at this--
his lunch money.

57
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:42,000
God didn't give you legs so
you could use them as scissors.

58
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:44,933
Well, I was just doing the moves
I learned from Ultimate Punching.

59
00:05:44,934 --> 00:05:47,297
Ultimate Punching?!

60
00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:49,501
"Ultimate" makes
everything worse.

61
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:50,568
Not frisbee.

62
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:54,034
- Otto, don't you have a sack to hacky?
- Indeed I do.

63
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:58,733
One...
Aw, I messed up.

64
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:01,367
One...
Aw, I messed up.

65
00:06:01,368 --> 00:06:05,167
Okay, I'm going to put a stop
to this Ultimate Punching.

66
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:07,120
You can't stop
an entire sport.

67
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:08,625
You'd need
several other mothers,

68
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:11,349
some sympathetic school
officials and clergymen...

69
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,733
A place to meet...
Some snacks...

70
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:16,501
- What else?
- A phone tree is invaluable.

71
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,200
How you fixed for staplers?

72
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:21,133
Those fliers don't stick to phone
poles by themselves, you know.

73
00:06:21,134 --> 00:06:23,934
Nelson, you really have
a knack for this.

74
00:06:23,935 --> 00:06:25,501
Well, when I grow up,

75
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:27,968
I hope to go into
event planning.

76
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:30,567
Oh, maybe someday
you can do Lisa's wedding.

77
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:32,696
Oh, I'd like that.

78
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,434
- Oh, my god.
- Ooh, so violent.

79
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,500
- Bumped his nose!
- Oh, he hit him.

80
00:06:45,992 --> 00:06:48,534
This goes on for a while.

81
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:50,434
Call me a killjoy,

82
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:53,367
but I think that because
this is not to my taste,

83
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:55,500
no one else should be able
to enjoy it.

84
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:56,834
I'm all over that.

85
00:06:56,835 --> 00:06:59,300
Mom, don't do this.

86
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:02,901
This sport is as fun for me
as having kids is for you.

87
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:03,933
Tell her, dad.

88
00:07:03,934 --> 00:07:06,379
You love Ultimate Punching
even more than I do.

89
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,492
Ultimate Punching is
exploitative, violent,

90
00:07:08,493 --> 00:07:10,940
and a bad influence
on our young people.

91
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:13,165
Studies have shown
your mother is right.

92
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,366
What the...?

93
00:07:15,206 --> 00:07:17,300
Chocolate,
whipped cream, cherries...

94
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:20,600
She got to you with a piece
of black forest cake.

95
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:24,534
It wasn't just a piece,
it was the whole cake!

96
00:07:24,535 --> 00:07:30,535
Frosting like snow on the
eaves of a bavarian castle!

97
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,634
- Glad you didn't come cheap.
- I couldn't help it!

98
00:07:36,635 --> 00:07:40,934
She knew my one
weakness-- that I'm weak!

99
00:07:40,935 --> 00:07:44,701
One, two, we say boo!

100
00:07:44,702 --> 00:07:46,734
Three, four, stop the gore!

101
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:48,767
Five, six, who's got tix?

102
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,434
Seven, eight,
use that gate.

103
00:07:52,342 --> 00:07:55,068
We need to take this
into the belly of the beast.

104
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:57,134
Mr. Scalper,
give me a ticket.

105
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:58,567
I am not a scalper.

106
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:01,267
I am a dude whose 200 friends
did not show up.

107
00:08:03,913 --> 00:08:05,067
What do we do now?

108
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,134
Let's talk about Marge
behind her back.

109
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:10,134
Have you ever noticed how that
baby of hers never says a thing?

110
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:12,001
I think it saw
something awful.

111
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:13,867
- Me, too.
- That's exactly what it is.

112
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,467
Oh, what else
could it be?

113
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:28,667
That woman has
natural breasts.

114
00:08:28,668 --> 00:08:30,268
This can't be good.

115
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:37,434
I'm Marge Simpson,
and I will not rest

116
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:40,400
Until you tear down
this septagon.

117
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:42,667
What?! Boo!

118
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:43,734
Crazy dame.

119
00:08:43,735 --> 00:08:45,467
Nobody tears down
the septagon.

120
00:08:45,468 --> 00:08:47,867
<i>Except for the arena crew
because hufflesnuffs on ice</i>

121
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:49,901
needs the space
tomorrow.

122
00:08:49,902 --> 00:08:53,101
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute,
I have a better idea.

123
00:08:54,782 --> 00:08:56,801
Marge, I'm Chett Englebrecht,

124
00:08:56,802 --> 00:09:01,600
UPKCC founder, commissioner,
and public face of the sport.

125
00:09:05,121 --> 00:09:06,734
Pleased to meet you, Chett.

126
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:09,434
Guys, please.

127
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:12,101
When you yell like that,
no one can hear me.

128
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:16,734
Chett, I'm here to ask
you one simple thing:

129
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:21,168
please go out of business
and donate all your profits.

130
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,834
At least in other sports,

131
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:26,801
they're trying to put a
ball in a net or a zone,

132
00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:29,467
But in this sport they don't
put anything in anything,

133
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,667
And if they did,
I wouldn't want to see it.

134
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,934
Okay, you win.

135
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:35,034
What?!

136
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:37,200
Annoying lady,
you make a great point.

137
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,298
I am going to shut down
this sport.

138
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:41,333
Really?

139
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:45,267
If you meet me in the Septagon,
fight me, and beat me.

140
00:09:45,268 --> 00:09:47,534
What?!
That's crazy.

141
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:51,634
What's wrong, Marge?
Do you have to ask your husband?

142
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:54,839
Good one!
Zing!

143
00:09:57,011 --> 00:10:00,475
That flattens my soda pop.
You're on.

144
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,367
- What'd I miss?
- Mmm, nothin'.

145
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:09,001
Mom, you can't fight that guy.

146
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah, Marge, he'll
knock your block off--

147
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:14,033
Thank you, Homie.

148
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:17,132
Listen, of all the crazy
things I've ever done,

149
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:19,733
<i>this is the craziest,
and you're doing it.</i>

150
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:21,266
I can't back out.

151
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:23,967
This is for a cause
that's bigger than I am.

152
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:27,700
If Gandhi could go without eating
for a whole three-hour movie,

153
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:29,266
I can do this.

154
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:32,099
Besides, I'm a woman.
He'll probably go easy on me.

155
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,633
Or kick the crap out of you.

156
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:36,133
Watch your
language, moron.

157
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:51,866
If I'm going to open a can
of whup-tushy,

158
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:55,667
I'd better get in shape with
some rhythmic gymnastics.

159
00:11:05,634 --> 00:11:08,499
Someone's got to stop her from
going through with this fight.

160
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,399
This goes against every
feminist bone in my body,

161
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,800
but dad, can't you control
your woman?

162
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:16,933
How can I control her?
I have nothing to withhold!

163
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:20,400
Oh, man, now she's writing
cutesy things with the ribbon.

164
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:30,466
Homer, this is bad.

165
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:33,633
One unlucky punch and Marge
could be bedridden for life.

166
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:36,800
Unable to move anything
but her left toe.

167
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:43,167
Oh, Marge, if only I knew
what these paintings meant.

168
00:11:46,235 --> 00:11:49,232
I know the woman I loved is
still in there somewhere,

169
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:52,299
Behind all this nonsense.

170
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,666
We've gotta get Marge some
professional training.

171
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:57,733
Carl, do you know heavyweight
champ Drederick Tatum?

172
00:11:57,734 --> 00:12:00,500
What? You think just 'cause I'm
black I know all other black people?

173
00:12:02,034 --> 00:12:04,166
Actually, Drederick and I
are very good friends.

174
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:07,833
We met through Dr. Hibbert at a party
at Bleeding Gums Murphy's house.

175
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:11,633
Well, Marge, you have definitely come
to the right crib. I'm always happy

176
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:15,067
to impart my pugilistic
prowess to a punching parvenu.

177
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,934
Now, the first lesson will
be to work the tattoos.

178
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,866
Flaming skull.
Obama.

179
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:23,000
Scooby-Doo. Scooby-Doo.
Scooby-Doo.

180
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:24,499
Now, work
"The Lord's Prayer."

181
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,666
I'm gonna order some lion food.
Hello? Yeah, how you doin'?

182
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:30,333
I'd like to order
two gazelles, an impala,

183
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,166
and throw in a couple
of wildebeests.

184
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:34,833
Oh, and a two-liter bottle
of diet cherry cola.

185
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:37,534
You just have one-liter bottles?
Okay, cancel the whole order.

186
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:42,900
The second element of mixed
martial arts is jujitsu,

187
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:46,333
in which we use an opponent's
strength against himself.

188
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:48,968
But I sneak some of my
strength in there, too.

189
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:52,767
Now, attack me
with great anger!

190
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:55,201
Surprising move!

191
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,634
<i>Next: Homer, hajime!</i>

192
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,099
Now, we stick foot in mouth,
Tie arms like pretzel,

193
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,034
And pop discs in spine
like bubble wrap.

194
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:15,367
- Is he okay?
- Oh, he feels no pain.

195
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:21,300
Sorry, my English is not so good.
I mean, he feels only pain.

196
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:27,366
Back when I wrestled at Yale,
I was in the lightest weight category--

197
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:28,700
"Ether weight."

198
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:32,133
Now, get ready to face the wrath
Of the "new haven nuisance!"

199
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:45,566
Side-mount!
Takedown! Advantage!

200
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:48,629
Reversal! Reversal!
Clinch! Clinch, I say!

201
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:52,733
Listen, I'm late
for a PTA meeting.

202
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:56,600
In order to save money, the following
presidents will no longer be taught:

203
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:59,866
Buchanan, Fillmore,
Pierce, Bush, Bush--

204
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:01,801
Could you please stop that?

205
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:04,217
Saratoga slam!
Aristotle's dilemma!

206
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,820
Knickerbocker
knucklebreaker! And so on.

207
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,701
Marge, I bet we got ten
minutes Till the kids wake up.

208
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:16,500
Marge! Marge!

209
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:20,933
Tomorrow night, your bedroom
will be the Septagon.

210
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:23,266
Your sleeping pill
will be my punches.

211
00:14:23,267 --> 00:14:25,199
By the way, what's that book
you're reading?

212
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,900
<i>Eat, Pray, Love.</i>

213
00:14:26,901 --> 00:14:29,299
More like "beat, slay, shove!"

214
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,367
The fireworks begin tomorrow!

215
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:35,333
I said tomorrow!

216
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,700
No can do.
We're out of fireworks.

217
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:39,232
Why'd you shoot 'em off now?

218
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:41,299
I have trouble concentrating.

219
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,333
I should be on antidepressants.

220
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:44,866
Ugh. Where was I?

221
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:46,033
"Beat, slay, shove."

222
00:14:46,034 --> 00:14:48,033
Right-- "beat, slay, shove!"

223
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:50,267
The fireworks start tomorrow!

224
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:54,701
I found some more,
but that was it!

225
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,386
A lot of people think
bullies are born awesome,

226
00:15:01,387 --> 00:15:04,304
but the fact is,
we have to train.

227
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:07,217
You don't get garlic knots like
these unless you work the bag.

228
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,449
Is there someone
in there?

229
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,800
It's my own fault.
I looked them in the eye

230
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:19,714
when I gave them my lunch money.

231
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:21,999
Someone should tell
your principal!

232
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,700
I'm well aware
of the situation.

233
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,699
Mom, I came here to tell you
It's not too late to back out.

234
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,574
I can't back out,
because if I fight him tomorrow,

235
00:15:39,575 --> 00:15:43,526
it'll be a less violent world
for you kids in the future.

236
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,304
There must be
a better way.

237
00:15:45,305 --> 00:15:46,815
There certainly is!

238
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,490
Marge Simpson reporting
for duty!

239
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,799
Dad, I keep telling you,
that won't work.

240
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,993
Let's go, Marge.
My class reunion starts in an hour.

241
00:15:58,648 --> 00:16:02,382
Uh, Moe, I have a confession to make.
I'm just Homer dressed as Marge.

242
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:04,963
Yeah, but last year, I took
Barney dressed as Marge.

243
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,599
Think how much better
they'll think you look.

244
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,721
Well, you'd better not leave me and
talk to your old friends all night.

245
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:12,983
Keep talkin' like that and
I'll leave you here right now!

246
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,199
Krusty, I'm honored
you invited me tonight.

247
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah, I thought a noisy public place
would be the best spot to tell you

248
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:22,999
that I've been
dating your wife.

249
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,038
What?!

250
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:26,306
Also, could you tell her
I'm dumping her?

251
00:16:26,307 --> 00:16:28,387
After 11 years,
the thrill is gone.

252
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:33,407
Marge, I tried my best to
talk you out of this.

253
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:36,193
But since you're going through
with it, I beg you,

254
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:39,801
just stay out of his way
and don't get hurt.

255
00:16:39,802 --> 00:16:43,487
And, mom, if you punch him in the junk,
You'll get no disrespect from me.

256
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:46,331
Hey, Bart, did you know
that's a haiku?

257
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:57,299
Time to square off in the ring--
That is, the Septagon!

258
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,140
- In this corner, weighing in at...
- Nobody needs to know that!

259
00:17:02,141 --> 00:17:04,737
Stands the "mom
I'd like to fight"--

260
00:17:04,738 --> 00:17:06,864
Marge Simpson!

261
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,392
And four obtuse angles over,
weighing in at 115 pounds,

262
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,530
Chett Englebrecht!

263
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,438
And, now... Let's begin
to rumba!

264
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,249
We've been ready for hours!

265
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,553
<i>I had car trouble!</i>

266
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,694
Don't worry, Marge.
Don't want to hurt you.

267
00:17:39,695 --> 00:17:40,895
I knew it!

268
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,097
That's the first time I ever hit
a woman I didn't love. Wow.

269
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,399
Come on! Come on! Get back on your feet!
I believe in you!

270
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,647
I'm doin' it, Moe!
Not you.

271
00:17:54,648 --> 00:17:56,801
Oh, thank God.
The pressure's off.

272
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,626
I'll save you,
Marge!

273
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,271
Hit my mom, will ya?

274
00:18:05,272 --> 00:18:07,925
Well, I'm gonna knock you out
and moon your corpse.

275
00:18:07,926 --> 00:18:09,077
Heck, I'll fight anyone.

276
00:18:09,078 --> 00:18:10,771
Except a man
my own size.

277
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:24,651
That's... my... son.

278
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,285
Tap out!

279
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,164
Don't make me
break your arm!

280
00:18:41,165 --> 00:18:44,331
Lady, why don't you break out
the lipstick and kiss my ass?

281
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:47,239
There sure is a lot o' talkin'
for a professional fight.

282
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,361
Eh, that's what you get
when you fight a woman.

283
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,672
And they spend all day eating bonbons
and watching General Hospital.

284
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:55,745
Which, by the way,
has never been better.

285
00:18:58,283 --> 00:19:00,736
Okay, I give! I give! I give!
You're better than me!

286
00:19:00,737 --> 00:19:02,649
Really?
Ooh, thank you.

287
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,956
- Now, let me go...
- Turn your back and take a bow.

288
00:19:05,957 --> 00:19:07,157
Okeydoke.

289
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,200
Thank you!

290
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,799
I'd just like to say one thing.

291
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,310
I only agreed to this fight because
I wanted to stop the violence.

292
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:38,799
And sure I got into great
shape And met some fun people,

293
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,068
but I ended up discovering
my own dark side.

294
00:19:43,069 --> 00:19:45,899
So from now on,
the only thing I'm fighting

295
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,104
is this cold I'm coming down with.

296
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,163
Mom, that's
a beautiful thought.

297
00:19:53,962 --> 00:19:56,650
I wish somebody would've
stuck around to hear it.

298
00:19:56,651 --> 00:19:57,981
Where did they all go?

299
00:19:57,982 --> 00:20:01,602
Two drunk guys were fighting
outside and everyone went to watch.

300
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,299
Ooh, ooh, can I go, Marge?
Can I? Can I?

301
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,255
No. Let's go home.

302
00:20:06,256 --> 00:20:09,104
We can enjoy some mixed
"marital" arts.

303
00:20:09,998 --> 00:20:12,426
Oh, no holds barred.

304
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:15,297
- Hey, Lise...
- Yeah?

305
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,899
I don't know when we'll
be in a septagon again.

306
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,833
When we'll want to settle this bad blood
that's been going on between us since you were born?

307
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,465
You're on.
