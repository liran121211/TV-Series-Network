00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,877
Hello, everybody.

3
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,844
Welcome to Under the Wrapper,

4
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,077
where I, Huell Howser,
apply the art of detection

5
00:00:33,144 --> 00:00:35,177
to your favorite confections.

6
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:38,077
Now, here's some opening titles
to sweeten the deal.

7
00:00:39,844 --> 00:00:41,910
Hey! Aah!

8
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:51,877
Wow!

9
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:53,410
Now, we've seen
how cookies crumble

10
00:00:53,477 --> 00:00:55,443
and soda gets its pop,

11
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,310
so let's take a close-up look

12
00:00:57,376 --> 00:01:00,677
at America's favorite drop--
the gumdrop!

13
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:02,111
Ooh!

14
00:01:02,177 --> 00:01:03,577
Every gumdrop is made

15
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:05,877
of a succulent substance
called gelatin.

16
00:01:05,944 --> 00:01:06,744
Amazing.

17
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,610
Gelatin comes from the skin,

18
00:01:08,677 --> 00:01:11,744
bones and hooves
of only the sickest horses.

19
00:01:12,777 --> 00:01:14,777
That's amazing.

20
00:01:14,844 --> 00:01:16,744
Change it!
Change it!

21
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,276
You just increased
the volume!

22
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,310
Welcome back

23
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,177
to the 62nd annual
Creative Arts Emmy Awards.

24
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:30,510
In Outstanding
Lighting Direction,

25
00:01:30,577 --> 00:01:32,443
Electronic, Multi-camera

26
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,243
for Variety, Music
or Comedy Programming,

27
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,410
we have... a three-way tie!

28
00:01:40,944 --> 00:01:42,510
Back to the horses.
Back to the horses!

29
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:43,111
God...

30
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,443
Gee, Lisa,
looks like tomorrow

31
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,977
I'll be shoveling ten feet
of global warming.

32
00:01:52,044 --> 00:01:54,243
Global warming
can cause weather

33
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,777
at both extremes--
hot and cold.

34
00:01:56,844 --> 00:02:00,577
I see. So you're saying
warming makes it colder.

35
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:02,877
Well, aren't you
the Queen of Crazyland?

36
00:02:02,944 --> 00:02:05,610
Everything's the opposite
of everything.

37
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,144
I'm Lisa Simpson.

38
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:11,376
Really?
Really?

39
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:12,810
Uh-huh,
all right.

40
00:02:19,077 --> 00:02:21,977
Mush, nerds, mush!

41
00:02:22,044 --> 00:02:23,744
I'm part of a team!

42
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,276
Oh, look how the snow glistens
on the tiniest branches.

43
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:30,276
Yeah, yeah,
miracles are all around us.

44
00:02:30,343 --> 00:02:32,910
Now, please. I am trying
to hear the school closings.

45
00:02:32,977 --> 00:02:35,276
The following schools
are closed.

46
00:02:35,343 --> 00:02:37,744
Springfield High School,
Springfield Middle School,

47
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,010
Springfield El...

48
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:42,677
...Excelente
Spanish Language School.

49
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:44,044
Oh!

50
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:45,577
Springfield
Element...

51
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:48,077
...al Center
for Periodic Table Studies.

52
00:02:48,144 --> 00:02:49,276
Oh!

53
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:50,410
Springfield Elementary Sc...

54
00:02:51,677 --> 00:02:52,944
...uba Diving Academy.

55
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,810
Oh, for crying out loud!

56
00:02:54,877 --> 00:02:57,944
And of course, Springfield
Elementary is closed.

57
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,410
We were just messing
with Bart Simpson.

58
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:03,510
I've got one.

59
00:03:03,577 --> 00:03:05,877
Springfield El...
bow Macaroni Factory.

60
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,844
Skinner! What factory makes
just one kind of pasta?

61
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,343
Uh, well, I just
thought, uh,

62
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,744
specialization being
the wave of the future?

63
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,610
Uh, probably, uh...

64
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:19,944
Snow day!

65
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,044
What the...?

66
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:36,910
What a smart way
to spend a snowy day.

67
00:03:36,977 --> 00:03:38,443
Good grief.

68
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:47,477
Headshot! Headshot!

69
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:48,944
Oh, right in the carrot.

70
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,310
Headshot.

71
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:52,276
Huh?

72
00:03:52,343 --> 00:03:55,410
A branch must have knocked out
the power lines.

73
00:03:55,477 --> 00:03:56,977
Fine. I'll see what's on TV.

74
00:03:59,343 --> 00:04:01,477
That runs on electricity, also.

75
00:04:01,543 --> 00:04:03,710
All right, I'll watch a DVD.

76
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,744
There's no way
that runs on electricity.

77
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:09,477
Really?
Does Obama know about this?

78
00:04:22,677 --> 00:04:25,111
I can't believe
this is how pilgrims lived.

79
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,343
Huh?

80
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,310
When Maggie's
nightlight goes out,

81
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:32,477
her onesie becomes a funsie.

82
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:35,810
This announcer has never
seen diapers so dapper.

83
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:37,643
What do you want?

84
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,477
I... want to play with you guys.

85
00:04:40,543 --> 00:04:43,977
Fine. Get this on in
two minutes, lose the attitude,

86
00:04:44,044 --> 00:04:45,810
and for God's sake,
suck in that pooch.

87
00:04:45,877 --> 00:04:48,010
Go, go, go!

88
00:04:48,077 --> 00:04:51,910
And now,
making his debut on the catwalk,

89
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:53,343
Bartholomew!

90
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,844
Belt is by Twizzler,

91
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,543
vest courtesy
of Nelson,

92
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,443
tights are by
Hello Kitty...

93
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,744
Hello Kitty?

94
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,310
I thought
they were Spider-Man heads.

95
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:02,343
Ew! Ew! Ew!

96
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:06,044
Oh! Stupid shoes over tights!

97
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:08,077
Why did I want to play
with a couple

98
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:09,276
of lame-o girls?

99
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,177
Because you
envy us.

100
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:15,877
Maggie and I share the deepest
bond there is: sisterhood.

101
00:05:15,944 --> 00:05:17,643
We'll be closer
than best friends

102
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,310
for the rest
of our lives.

103
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:21,144
But you'll never know
what that's like,

104
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:23,543
because you won't
ever have a brother.

105
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,376
I don't need a brother.

106
00:05:25,443 --> 00:05:27,177
I'm a bad ass loner
like Wolverine,

107
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,376
who leaves whenever people
beg him not to leave.

108
00:05:34,677 --> 00:05:37,343
"'Off with their heads!'
said the Red Queen."

109
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,044
Now, pull the tab.

110
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:40,577
More.

111
00:05:40,643 --> 00:05:42,343
More.

112
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,343
More.

113
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,777
Oh, I don't need a brother,

114
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:03,577
and no dream will convince me
I do.

115
00:06:30,077 --> 00:06:31,744
I want a turn!
I want a turn!

116
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,044
You've got the bike.

117
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:34,410
It's not the same.

118
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,376
That's a perfect spiral, Eli.

119
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:40,177
Winning a Super Bowl
just doesn't compare

120
00:06:40,243 --> 00:06:42,543
to chucking the ball
around with my brother.

121
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,276
It's easy being
a winner in the pros.

122
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:46,376
Try winning two high school
basketball championships

123
00:06:46,443 --> 00:06:47,777
like I did.

124
00:06:47,844 --> 00:06:48,844
Good for
you, Squirt.

125
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,144
I'm the oldest!

126
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,844
Keep away from Cooper!

127
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,211
Hey.

128
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:04,376
Why'd you stop?

129
00:07:04,443 --> 00:07:06,777
I-I... I just... I just
wanted to say something.

130
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,243
What?
Dick?

131
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,710
Yes?
You-You're
my brother, and...

132
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:11,010
...I love you.

133
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:12,477
Well, I love
you, too, Tom.

134
00:07:12,543 --> 00:07:13,710
Thank you very much.

135
00:07:13,777 --> 00:07:15,111
But if you hadn't
fought CBS,

136
00:07:15,177 --> 00:07:17,243
they would never have
fired us from our show.

137
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,710
Oh, they-they didn't fire us,
Dick.

138
00:07:18,777 --> 00:07:20,376
They didn't?
We quit.

139
00:07:20,443 --> 00:07:22,077
We did not quit.
They fired us.

140
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:23,443
You... You were fired.

141
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,910
They fired us
from the show.

142
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,443
No, they fired you.

143
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,977
They didn't fire me.

144
00:07:28,044 --> 00:07:29,177
Why wouldn't they fire you?

145
00:07:29,243 --> 00:07:31,310
Because they can't fire...

146
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:33,310
the yo-yo master!

147
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:35,610
And here is "shoot the moon."

148
00:07:35,677 --> 00:07:37,144
I'm so cool.

149
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,443
Now look what
you've done.

150
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,477
Bart was having a
perfectly nice dream

151
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:44,310
about brothers,
and you ruined it.

152
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:46,144
Yeah? We? Well, huh.

153
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:01,443
Oh, my God, I want a brother!

154
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,098
- You can have mine, but he's
kind of an idiot. -Oh.

155
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:10,363
Dad, I want
a baby brother.

156
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,639
Son, I love you kids.

157
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:14,139
But I'm only going
to the hospital

158
00:08:14,205 --> 00:08:16,406
one more time in my life,
and I ain't coming out.

159
00:08:16,472 --> 00:08:17,706
Lisa got a sister.

160
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:18,972
Why can't you have another boy?

161
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,205
Girls are easy.

162
00:08:20,272 --> 00:08:21,838
Girls love Daddy.

163
00:08:21,905 --> 00:08:24,172
Girls make birthday cards
with glitter on them.

164
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,773
Girls can marry
a hockey player

165
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,572
and get me seats
to hockey games.

166
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,506
Girls don't steal
my knives...

167
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:32,139
...and I don't have to tell
girls how their bodies work,

168
00:08:32,205 --> 00:08:34,306
'cause I don't know.

169
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:36,406
You never told me
how my body works.

170
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:38,872
Point and shoot.

171
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:43,039
My dad
is such a jerk.

172
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,339
I want a baby brother,
and he said no.

173
00:08:45,406 --> 00:08:48,139
Maybe you could trick
your parents into making a baby

174
00:08:48,205 --> 00:08:50,239
the way my Mom nearly tricked
Charles Barkley.

175
00:08:50,306 --> 00:08:52,239
Trick 'em.
I like it.

176
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:53,606
But how?

177
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:56,572
A romantic
dinner?

178
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,539
That's
a great idea!

179
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,805
Oh, my God!

180
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:03,272
I killed Kenny!
Ralph.

181
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:04,773
No, I killed
Kenny yesterday.

182
00:09:04,838 --> 00:09:06,205
What did I do now?

183
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:12,205
Do I smell tarragon-crusted
Atlantic salmon?

184
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:16,872
Bart's cooked us
a five-course romantic dinner.

185
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:19,306
You had me at "five-course,"

186
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:22,406
you lost me at "romantic," and
you got me back at "dinner."

187
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:28,905
Oh, what a lovely evening.

188
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:31,339
And it's not over yet.

189
00:09:31,406 --> 00:09:33,472
Oh.

190
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,539
Hope you saved room
for passion fruit soufflé

191
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:37,372
with crème anglaise for two.

192
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:39,572
And one for Mom.

193
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,838
There comes a time
in every marriage

194
00:09:42,905 --> 00:09:44,506
when it comes
down to this.

195
00:09:44,572 --> 00:09:46,905
Do we eat dessert,
or do we make love?

196
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:48,472
Maybe we could do both.

197
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:49,805
Yeah!

198
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:54,039
We couldn't do both.

199
00:09:54,105 --> 00:09:56,272
No... we could not.

200
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:06,172
Are you sure this'll work?

201
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:10,105
Hey, this is the DVD
my parents used to make me.

202
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:11,938
So it kind of works.

203
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:15,905
Homer Simpson,

204
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:19,039
look what the snuggle fairy left
in our DVD player.

205
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:22,706
Hmm. People in other
countries make love?

206
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:23,972
It's about time.

207
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,972
Which position
should we try?

208
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,039
The Yawning Monkey?
The Pair Of Tongs?

209
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:29,773
Ooh, look.
Congress Of The Crow!

210
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,306
Okay!

211
00:10:31,372 --> 00:10:35,039
All right, all right, um,
your ankle goes there...

212
00:10:35,105 --> 00:10:37,639
Uh-huh, and now
hand me your neck.

213
00:10:37,706 --> 00:10:40,239
And turn that upside down.

214
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,639
Mm-hmm, and swivel that till
you hear a grinding noise.

215
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:45,105
Don't look at that.

216
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:49,472
A few more minor
adjustments, and...

217
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:50,938
Ow!

218
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:53,439
Ooh! Oh!

219
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:55,938
More Vicodin
and eggs, please.

220
00:10:58,306 --> 00:11:01,139
Um.

221
00:11:01,205 --> 00:11:03,572
Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Oh.

222
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:07,072
What do you want, Simpson?

223
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:08,972
Can't you see we're
busy hockin' loogs?

224
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:11,639
Nice loog!

225
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:13,072
Wish I'd hocked that!

226
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,872
Look, I want
a baby brother,

227
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:16,905
but I can't get
my parents to do it.

228
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:18,172
Here's the thing,
Simpson.

229
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:21,005
No matter how dead their
relationship seems,

230
00:11:21,072 --> 00:11:24,606
all parents eventually commit
the heinous act of love.

231
00:11:24,673 --> 00:11:26,105
Mine do it once
a year

232
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:28,105
on the magical day
when the prison

233
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:31,938
and the insane asylum have
their annual mixer.

234
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:34,639
What you've got to worry about
is the pill.

235
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:36,239
The pill? What's that?

236
00:11:36,306 --> 00:11:39,539
It's medicine doctors give moms
to keep babies up in Heaven.

237
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:42,172
Well, I need a baby now, and
I'm not getting any younger!

238
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:43,938
Then get rid of
the pills.

239
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:45,506
Got it. How can I thank you?

240
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,239
Uh... give yourself
a wedgie.

241
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,972
Don't you want
to do it?
Can't.

242
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,872
Carpal-nurple syndrome.

243
00:11:50,938 --> 00:11:52,673
The doctor said if I
didn't take it easy,

244
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:55,072
I might never shove a kid's
face in the drinking
fountain again.

245
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:56,139
Scary.

246
00:11:56,205 --> 00:11:58,105
A wakeup call for all of us.

247
00:12:01,272 --> 00:12:03,105
Mom'll never know.

248
00:12:09,673 --> 00:12:11,172
Bart Simpson!

249
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:14,205
Tac-Tics?!

250
00:12:16,272 --> 00:12:18,205
Bart, you've always
been a handful,

251
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:21,472
but you've never interfered
with my reproductive freedom.

252
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:22,739
Why now?

253
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:24,838
I just wanted a baby brother,

254
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:27,972
but Dad said I was one "Uday"
who didn't need a "Qusay."

255
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,739
I just wanted what Lisa
and Maggie have.

256
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:33,372
Oh, Barty, I'm sorry.

257
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:37,072
But your father and I think
that three kids is just perfect.

258
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:39,205
What about what I want?

259
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:40,805
I'd help you take
care of him.

260
00:12:40,872 --> 00:12:44,272
Remember those hamsters
you were going to take care of?

261
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,139
Oh, my God, the hamsters!

262
00:12:46,205 --> 00:12:49,072
And even if we did
have another baby,

263
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,205
it might not be a boy.

264
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,272
It might be another sister.

265
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,005
Another sister?!

266
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:02,339
How could you possibly need
all these clothes?

267
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,472
Shopping: it's the most fun
you could have standing up.

268
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:07,506
Hey, you didn't see
what I cooked up

269
00:13:07,572 --> 00:13:09,472
in the galley of my last
flight to London.

270
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,938
They don't call it "Virgin"
Airlines anymore.

271
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,339
You're right.

272
00:13:19,406 --> 00:13:20,938
I can't risk another girl.

273
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:22,639
Use whatever birth
control you want.

274
00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:24,673
It's your body.

275
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:26,205
That's right!

276
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,472
It is!

277
00:13:29,805 --> 00:13:31,339
One boy to go, please.

278
00:13:31,406 --> 00:13:32,805
Easy on the freckles.

279
00:13:32,872 --> 00:13:34,572
A ten-year-old can't
adopt a child.

280
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,606
Oh, you think he's for me!

281
00:13:37,673 --> 00:13:40,039
You know, the orphan
is for my folks--

282
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:41,872
they can't have more kids.

283
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:43,439
It is so sad--

284
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:46,272
a real-life Jaws bit
off my dad's wiener.

285
00:13:47,572 --> 00:13:49,905
Come on, I'd be an awesome
big brother!

286
00:13:49,972 --> 00:13:51,838
I've got videogames!
A tree house!

287
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:54,773
A garage stuffed to the rafters
with illegal fireworks!

288
00:13:55,972 --> 00:13:57,905
Oh, sweet Meerschaum,

289
00:13:57,972 --> 00:14:00,706
take me away.

290
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,105
Uh-oh.

291
00:14:02,172 --> 00:14:04,172
I'm sorry, kid.
It's not gonna happen.

292
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:06,172
I'd give my brother
everything I have!

293
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:08,172
He could be the race car
in Monopoly!

294
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:10,339
Monopoly!

295
00:14:10,406 --> 00:14:13,239
The race car!

296
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:20,239
Wake up!

297
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:21,572
I'm Bart Simpson.

298
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,872
Who the hell are you?

299
00:14:22,938 --> 00:14:24,205
I'm your new brother!

300
00:14:24,272 --> 00:14:25,606
Are you from the orphanage,

301
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:31,318
or do I really not understand
how babies are born.

302
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:35,243
So, Charlie, how did you escape
the island of misfit boys?

303
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:36,809
Shinnied down
a drainpipe.

304
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,809
You like to shinny?
I like to shinny.

305
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:40,942
Where do you see yourself
in 20 years?

306
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:43,176
One-armed drummer
in a prison rock band.

307
00:14:43,243 --> 00:14:45,143
Nice! Favorite Beatle?

308
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:45,675
Dung.

309
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:47,109
Me, too!

310
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:49,276
There must be some reason
no one ever adopted you.

311
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,809
Is one of your
feet a hand?

312
00:14:50,876 --> 00:14:53,176
People only want
to adopt babies.

313
00:14:53,243 --> 00:14:54,443
Babies?

314
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,642
We've got one of those.

315
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:56,842
Overrated.

316
00:14:59,176 --> 00:15:00,942
Shop it somewhere
else, sister.

317
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:14,076
Dad, this is Charlie,
my new, um,

318
00:15:14,143 --> 00:15:15,909
best friend.
Hello, sir.

319
00:15:15,976 --> 00:15:18,876
You're going to be seeing a lot
of him around the house.

320
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:20,009
Well, welcome,
Charlie!

321
00:15:20,076 --> 00:15:21,276
Nice to meet ya!

322
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,443
No glasses--
way to go!

323
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,009
This one's a keeper!

324
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:27,176
Yo!

325
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:28,609
Check out my brother, Charlie!

326
00:15:28,675 --> 00:15:29,809
Brother?

327
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:31,143
What are you talking about?

328
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:33,076
How come I've never
seen him before?

329
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:35,009
Uh, he was born
with two noses

330
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:36,443
and we hid him away

331
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,043
till we could afford
to cut one off.

332
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:39,209
Oh, yeah!

333
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:40,309
Yeah.
Two noses!

334
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:42,542
You deserve
a brother, Bart.

335
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,842
You deserve
good things!

336
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:56,376
When poking a
dead animal,

337
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:58,243
don't go straight
for the eye.

338
00:15:58,309 --> 00:15:59,642
Build up to it.

339
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:11,575
My son, afraid
of water.

340
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,176
So, Lisa, how do you like
sharing a bathroom

341
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,476
with two brothers?

342
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:20,809
Two brothers?

343
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:21,976
Bart, who is
this kid?

344
00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:23,976
Be cool, be cool--
he's an orphan.

345
00:16:24,043 --> 00:16:25,443
You know,
just like Annie,

346
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,443
except he's a dude
and he hates tomorrow.

347
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,176
I hate it so much!

348
00:16:29,243 --> 00:16:31,742
Bart, you have to take him back!

349
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:34,109
You're just jealous 'cause now
I've got what you've got

350
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:36,609
with Maggie, only better because
we're dudes with 'tudes!

351
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,976
Kids, calm down! Here.

352
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:47,043
Have a Not Very Berry Blast.

353
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:49,510
It goes great with our
"notton candy."

354
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:54,176
Awesome, they made
a sequel to Sever IV.

355
00:16:54,243 --> 00:16:56,510
This movie's going to be
great, full of blood and gore

356
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,842
and torture and guts and...

357
00:16:57,909 --> 00:16:59,309
Two kid's tickets for

358
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:01,510
The Diversity Kittens.

359
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:04,376
...and murder and swears
and brains and basements

360
00:17:04,443 --> 00:17:08,443
and bones and saws and lungs
and faces worn as hats.

361
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:10,976
Hmm.

362
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,575
Now, you probably think Sever V
is a rip-off of Sever IV,

363
00:17:16,642 --> 00:17:17,976
but it's actually based

364
00:17:18,043 --> 00:17:21,243
on the rich history
of Hong Kong torture films.

365
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,243
Uh-oh.

366
00:17:27,143 --> 00:17:29,209
The boogeyman's going
to eat my brain!

367
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:32,809
I'm sorry. I guess having
a little brother

368
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:34,476
is more responsibility
than I thought,

369
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:35,476
especially
'cause I thought

370
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:37,076
it'd be no
responsibility at all.

371
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:39,476
Aah, it's the
boogeyman!

372
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:42,043
There is no such thing
as a boogeyman.

373
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:43,343
Boogie, boogie,
boogie, boogie, boogie!

374
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,500
Simpson, step away from the orphan.

375
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,239
Do not give him any more love.
I repeat,

376
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,005
do not give him any more love.

377
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:55,862
Mr. Policeman,
please take me home.

378
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:58,428
That mean boy took me
to a scary movie

379
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,162
and he covered
his sister's doll

380
00:18:00,228 --> 00:18:01,628
in peanut butter
and bird seed.

381
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:06,695
Charlie, you'd rat on me?

382
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:09,261
Hey, no, no, what do
you think you're do--?

383
00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:14,628
My snout,

384
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:16,628
my beautiful snout!

385
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:21,795
Sorry, dude, I didn't see you.

386
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:23,762
How could you not see me?

387
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:26,228
My arms are like hams.

388
00:18:26,295 --> 00:18:27,895
Hams!

389
00:18:27,962 --> 00:18:29,295
Hey!

390
00:18:30,495 --> 00:18:32,261
Go ahead, leave.

391
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:34,129
That's what you're good at!

392
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:40,328
Where are we going
to hide?

393
00:18:43,995 --> 00:18:47,628
The same place Eskimos
hide from penguins.

394
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:54,595
Now, Charlie,
we'll have to live

395
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:56,228
off what we find
in the garbage--

396
00:18:56,295 --> 00:18:58,628
banana strings,
muffin liners--

397
00:18:58,695 --> 00:19:00,662
but it'll be cool
'cause it's just you and me.

398
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:01,595
Hello, Bart.

399
00:19:02,695 --> 00:19:04,062
How did you find us?

400
00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:07,096
You left a trail
of lost winter clothes.

401
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:08,495
Are you gonna turn us in?

402
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:11,695
No, I'm gonna convince you
to turn yourselves in.

403
00:19:11,762 --> 00:19:13,929
Never.
Never, huh?
What are you going to eat?

404
00:19:13,995 --> 00:19:15,729
Snow-- God's cotton candy.

405
00:19:15,795 --> 00:19:17,995
Huh, snow, hmm?

406
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:19,261
Better change
your mind quick, Bart.

407
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:21,428
A snow plow is coming
to seal us in.

408
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,395
The Plow King lives!

409
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,062
And Bart, maybe Charlie
can't be your little brother,

410
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:28,162
but you'll always be
a big brother to me.

411
00:19:28,228 --> 00:19:30,295
Please don't send me
back, Bart.

412
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:32,428
This was
the best day of my life.

413
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:39,528
Oh, no!

414
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:44,495
You took too long to make
an obvious decision!

415
00:19:44,562 --> 00:19:46,129
Don't worry,
me and Charlie have

416
00:19:46,196 --> 00:19:48,295
one thing
you'll never have.

417
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:52,162
Point and shoot, bro,
point and shoot.

418
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:58,528
Oh, gross, gross,
gross, gross.

419
00:19:58,595 --> 00:20:00,228
Hey, you're alive,
aren't you?

420
00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:01,662
I wish I weren't.

421
00:20:02,695 --> 00:20:04,228
I'm here to visit Charlie.

422
00:20:04,295 --> 00:20:05,562
Charlie?
He's gone.

423
00:20:05,628 --> 00:20:07,729
A nice new family
adopted him.

424
00:20:07,795 --> 00:20:10,729
Now he has six
wonderful sisters.

425
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:11,895
He's so cute.

426
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:13,261
Let's do his nails.

427
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:15,295
He's my baby.
He's my baby.

428
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:16,462
Mom!
I'm telling.

429
00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:17,428
Dad!

430
00:20:17,495 --> 00:20:18,862
I want ice cream.

431
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:20,395
I'm a princess.
No, I'm a princess.

432
00:20:20,462 --> 00:20:21,628
She got juice
on my sweater.

433
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:23,328
Big cheater.
You're the cheater.

434
00:20:23,395 --> 00:20:24,328
Ugly.

435
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:26,428
So many sisters.

436
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,361
Save me, Bart.

437
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,428
I know
you miss him, boy,

438
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:35,261
so let's you and me spend some
quality father and son time.

439
00:20:39,762 --> 00:20:41,628
That's so fake.

440
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:42,562
That's so fake.

441
00:20:42,628 --> 00:20:43,829
I don't know how they--

442
00:20:45,562 --> 00:20:47,196
Too real!

443
00:20:48,762 --> 00:20:49,962
Oh, come on.

444
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:53,062
Look out!

445
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:54,528
Why would that guy--?

446
00:20:54,595 --> 00:20:55,995
Look out!

447
00:20:56,062 --> 00:20:58,261
That's fake.

448
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:03,495
<i>Take it, Tom!

449
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,096
<i>Take it, Tom!

450
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:06,562
<i>Hey, wait a minute.
Wait, hold it, hold it.

451
00:21:06,628 --> 00:21:08,062
<i>I said, "Take it, Tom."

452
00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:09,662
<i>Did you hear me say,
"Take it, Tom"?

453
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:12,096
<i>I didn't hear you say, "Take it."

454
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:14,528
<i>Well, what did you think you heard?

455
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:17,162
<i>I didn't, I didn't think I heard what
you think you said.

456
00:21:17,228 --> 00:21:18,528
<i>Well, what do you think I said?

457
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:20,695
<i>Well, I... I heard...

458
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:23,129
<i>It sounded like you said
"naked bacon." "Naked bacon"?

459
00:21:23,196 --> 00:21:24,962
<i>Sounded like "naked bacon."
It sounded like I said...

460
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:26,462
<i>Did somebody say "naked bacon"?

461
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:27,662
<i>- Yeah, see?
- What?

462
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:29,029
<i>We all thought it was "naked bacon."

463
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:30,829
<i>Yeah, it sounded like
"naked bacon" to me.

464
00:21:30,895 --> 00:21:32,962
<i>I don't know why they say
you're the dumb guy, Tom.

465
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:34,228
<i>I don't know, either.

466
00:21:34,295 --> 00:21:36,328
<i>You said "naked bacon."

467
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,196
<i>I definitely said, "Take it, Tom."

468
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:40,129
<i>But if you... No, you
said "naked bacon."

469
00:21:40,196 --> 00:21:42,628
<i>That's what I thought. We both agree...

470
00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:44,895
<i>You may both agree, but folk singers

471
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:46,562
<i>never say, "Take it, naked bacon."

472
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:48,395
<i>Do you guys know "Funkytown"?

473
