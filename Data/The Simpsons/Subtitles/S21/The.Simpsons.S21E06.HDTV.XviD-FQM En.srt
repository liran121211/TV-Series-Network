1
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:51,367
Ooh!

2
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:04,634
D'oh!

3
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,133
* On the twelfth day
of Christmas *

4
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,000
* My true love gave to me *

5
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:13,667
* 12 Grampas grumbling *

6
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:15,801
* 11 Barneys belching *

7
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,234
* Ten Lennys leaping *

8
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,934
* Nine Carls dancing *

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,434
* Eight Moes a-milking *

10
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:21,934
* Seven Selmas smoking *

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,634
* Six Flanders praying *

12
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:26,968
* Five golden Frinks *

13
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:28,601
* Four crawling nerds *

14
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:29,968
* Three-eyed fish *

15
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:31,467
* Two special Ralphs *

16
00:01:31,534 --> 00:01:36,601
* And a Maggie in a snugglie. *

18
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:49,634
So, what prank are you
going to lead off with?

19
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:51,100
The exploding pen.

20
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:53,701
Don't think
I've heard of it.

21
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:56,701
Let the games begin.

22
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,934
Simpson, that is a rebuilt
Yugoslavian engine.

23
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,801
There isn't even
a Yugoslavia anymore!

24
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,200
Bring it back at once!

25
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:52,167
You're the boss.

26
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:59,234
Stupid punishment.

27
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,801
I hate hard work,
unless it's on pranks.

28
00:03:01,868 --> 00:03:05,200
Shiny enough to see
Skinner's ugly face.

29
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:07,634
Come with me.

30
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:11,734
I'll grill your cheese yet, boy.

31
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,767
You weren't the first prankster
to destroy

32
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:15,634
the car I rent from mother,
and you won't be the last.

33
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:17,367
"Rent"?
Rent to own.

34
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:19,200
Just 35 more payments,
and it's halfway mine.

35
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:22,033
The point is, I've seen
hooligans like you come and go.

36
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,300
You're all just a big blur
of short pants

37
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:25,834
and sinister smiles.

38
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:28,200
<i>Well, maybe so,
but I'm the best.

39
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:31,033
The best of your era, maybe.

40
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,367
Are you saying
there was a kid who
was worse than me?

41
00:03:33,434 --> 00:03:34,901
Way worse.

42
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:36,033
Anyway, think
no more about it.

43
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,300
You're dismissed.

44
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:38,601
Wait! Wait!
If there's someone worse,

45
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,033
I have to know who he is.

46
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,100
"He"?

47
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,267
It's a she?

48
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:43,934
Just kidding,
it's a guy.

49
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:47,334
But let's not dwell
on a mysterious figure

50
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
from the past who was
your superior in every way.

51
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:50,467
Out you go.

52
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,267
Milhouse, there was
a guy who pulled

53
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:57,701
even bigger pranks
than me!

54
00:03:57,767 --> 00:04:01,100
Wow! Imagine his sidekick.

55
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,300
Man, if he lost
that giant inhaler,

56
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:14,133
he'd really be in trouble
with his parents.

57
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,000
Hmm.

58
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,534
* Tubs are for bath time
and water-splashy fun *

59
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:25,701
* But there's one thing
that must never be done *

60
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,734
* Poop in the tub *

61
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,634
* Poop in the tub *

62
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:33,434
* I'm not gonna
poop in the tub. *

63
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:35,100
<i>Okay, everyone!

64
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:36,234
Snack time!

65
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,234
I've got milk and cookies.

66
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,434
Hydroxeos?!

67
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:42,367
Marge, how could you?!

68
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:45,033
Those cookies are full of
high fructose corn syrup

69
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,868
and partially
hydrogenated oils.

70
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:49,234
Have you even read
the books I've read?

71
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,634
But this is
from the Kwik-E-Mart.

72
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:52,334
You and your husband
work there.

73
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,234
I would sooner pour
the polluted water of the Ganges

74
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,200
down their gullets than give
them this carton

75
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:59,167
of cow cancer
you call "milk."

76
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:01,667
Sorry. I didn't know.

77
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,434
Marge, until you start
serving healthy food,

78
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:07,601
the Midday Mommies
are pulling you from
snack rotation.

79
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,400
Hydrogenated, ugh!

80
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,234
Mm-hmm.

81
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,868
A prankster that awesome

82
00:05:18,934 --> 00:05:20,734
must've made
the school paper.

83
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,601
Hmm. Lis,

84
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,100
I just discovered
something weird.

85
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:27,801
Ten years ago,
this paper didn't publish

86
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:29,667
for two whole weeks.

87
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,234
Now, before the gap,
look at Skinner.

88
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:38,701
Hmm.

89
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:40,667
<i>And here he is
after the gap.

90
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,467
Hmm, something must've
happened during those two weeks

91
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:50,200
to turn Skinner from cool to,
as you would say, "tool."

92
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,601
I know what happened:

93
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,567
the ultimate prank.

94
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:58,267
A prank that changed
Skinner from cool to tool.

95
00:05:58,334 --> 00:06:00,000
Is that a backhoe
behind him?

96
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,367
Huh.

97
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:02,567
It is!

98
00:06:02,634 --> 00:06:04,601
Zoom in and enhance.
Mm.

99
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,801
Willie!

100
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,267
He must know the answer.

101
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:10,934
Before you go,
can you distribute

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,534
these newspapers
throughout the school?

103
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:15,467
Well, I'd be a pretty
lousy brother if I didn't.

104
00:06:17,434 --> 00:06:19,234
Willie, I know
you witnessed

105
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,234
the most awesome prank
since creation.

106
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,567
Can you tell me about it?

107
00:06:22,634 --> 00:06:24,434
I'll nae speak to ye

108
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:27,000
of those dark times,
Bart Simpson.

109
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:29,434
But if there was
a more awesome dude than I,

110
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:32,100
I've got to know who he was,
what he did

111
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:33,834
and how many days
detention he got.

112
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:35,567
Something happened.

113
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:38,234
Something that changed
Skinner and you.

114
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,701
I haven't changed!

115
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,801
I've always been
Swim Teacher Willie

116
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,100
and I always will be!

117
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:44,634
See, oh...

118
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:46,434
All right, I'll tell ya.

119
00:06:46,501 --> 00:06:49,267
Years ago,
this school had a pool.

120
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:54,534
<i>I was an eager, young swim
coach, teaching American youth

121
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:58,033
<i>the revolutionary
Aberdeen crawl.

122
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,667
<i>It was a talented group,
and we were

123
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:01,968
<i>all set to go
to the state finals.

124
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:04,968
<i>I shaved and waxed
the boys myself.

125
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:09,467
<i>Then came
the Night of the Wigglers.

126
00:07:09,534 --> 00:07:11,167
What an awesome day!

127
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:14,667
Yo, Skin-man!
Little help?

128
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,300
Right back at you, Jason.

129
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:17,968
Stay in school.
I will.

130
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:20,834
I am so stoked
for my daily swim.

131
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,801
<i>Had he stopped whistlin'
and looked down,

132
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:27,100
<i>the world wouldn't
have changed that night.

133
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:30,501
<i>But he didn't, and it did.

134
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:38,434
Worms!

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,300
<i>He spent all weekend in that
crypt full of creepy-crawlies.

136
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:04,033
<i>Monday was
teacher development day,

137
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,300
<i>so Skinner wasn't rescued
till Tuesday morn.

138
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:12,334
<i>And by then, he was the twisted
monster you see today.

139
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,868
Shut this pool down,
Groundskeeper Willie.

140
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,200
Willie. Bart.

141
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:20,300
Monster.

142
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,100
So my ass isn't the baddest

143
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,200
in the history
of this school!

144
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:24,400
Who did it, Willie?

145
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:26,934
His name is Andy Hamilton.

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,868
Andy Hamilton.

147
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:32,734
But whatever you do,

148
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:35,467
never tell me where
you learned his name,

149
00:08:41,217 --> 00:08:42,617
Marge, what
are you doing?

150
00:08:42,684 --> 00:08:44,984
This junk food has got to go.

151
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:47,417
It's full of chemicals,
trans fats

152
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:49,584
and hard-pore corn.

153
00:08:50,884 --> 00:08:52,018
No!

154
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,817
Don't worry, my sweets!

155
00:08:57,884 --> 00:09:00,018
I'll put out the fire!

156
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:01,517
Homie, no!

157
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:03,617
That topping
is a petroleum by-product!

158
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:10,350
Ow!

159
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:15,550
"Andy Hamilton,
53 Hyperion Drive."

160
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:18,517
Bart, it's not
always a good idea

161
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:19,851
to meet your hero.

162
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:22,550
I once followed Santa home
from the department store,

163
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:25,283
<i>and what I saw wasn't pretty.

164
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,183
I can't live my life,
knowing there might be

165
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,584
someone better than me
at the one thing I'm good at.

166
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:32,784
EntrÃ© and partay!

167
00:09:35,717 --> 00:09:37,051
Krazy Glue!

168
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,350
Bart, you've been pranked!

169
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:40,951
Eh, it needs a topper.

170
00:09:41,018 --> 00:09:42,917
And look, some idiot
left glue loosener

171
00:09:42,984 --> 00:09:44,550
just lying around!

172
00:09:48,317 --> 00:09:50,851
Ah! Here it comes.

173
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,851
Ay, caramba!

174
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:56,118
Man, it is an honor

175
00:09:56,183 --> 00:09:57,951
to meet the guy
who wormed Skinner.

176
00:09:58,018 --> 00:09:59,417
You know, when I was your age,

177
00:09:59,484 --> 00:10:00,851
we couldn't film
our pranks for YouTube.

178
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:02,484
It was local news or nothing.

179
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,684
Potato chip?

180
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:07,183
Hmm, wait a minute.

181
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,851
Are there spring snakes
in this can?

182
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:10,617
No, no-no, no-no, no-no.
Give me some credit.

183
00:10:12,051 --> 00:10:13,183
It's a real snake.

184
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,084
Whoa!

185
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,951
Don't worry, it's defanged.

186
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,517
Although he can still

187
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:19,617
rub poison on you
with his gums.

188
00:10:22,118 --> 00:10:24,051
I would really wash
that arm if I were you.

189
00:10:24,118 --> 00:10:27,550
Can I go home now?
You should probably wait.

190
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:29,550
You're going to be
very sleepy for the
next few hours.

191
00:10:29,617 --> 00:10:31,051
Isn't this the best
day of your life?

192
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:38,450
So, you want to be

193
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:40,984
Springfield Elementary's
next Andy Hamilton?

194
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:44,183
Then you'll have to top
these awesome pranks.

195
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,118
The bear traps
in gym class.

196
00:10:46,183 --> 00:10:48,150
The fire in
the drinking fountain.

197
00:10:48,217 --> 00:10:49,984
And, of course,
the fake heart attack

198
00:10:50,051 --> 00:10:52,350
on an international flight.

199
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:55,350
They had to land
the plane in Nairobi!

200
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:56,851
Some chick missed
her own wedding!

201
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:01,118
I am impressed.

202
00:11:04,484 --> 00:11:07,283
<i>Oh, Andy has the perfect life.

203
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,150
All he does is reminisce
about his pranks.

204
00:11:09,217 --> 00:11:11,051
And when his mom
gets home from work,

205
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:12,617
she makes him whatever
sandwich he wants.

206
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,917
This Andy sounds
like kind of a loser.

207
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:18,084
How could someone so
much like me be a loser?

208
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,884
* Loser! *

209
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:21,484
Would a loser have showed me

210
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,018
how to put printer's ink
in a bottle of shampoo?

211
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,684
I've never felt so clean!

212
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:28,350
* A loo-oo-ooser! *

213
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:30,550
Yeah, but, uh, uh...

214
00:11:30,617 --> 00:11:33,450
Dad, Lisa's making me see
things from both sides again!

215
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:35,217
Lisa, I warned
you about that!

216
00:11:35,283 --> 00:11:37,283
Shouldn't Bart have all
the information he needs

217
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,684
to make an informed decision?

218
00:11:38,751 --> 00:11:40,617
Well,you...

219
00:11:40,684 --> 00:11:42,283
Now you're doing
it to me!

220
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,384
Oh!

221
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:46,584
Mom, what would you do

222
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:48,884
if someone you cared
about might be a loser,

223
00:11:48,951 --> 00:11:50,283
but they thought
they were awesome?

224
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,051
Are you talking
about your father?

225
00:11:52,118 --> 00:11:53,684
That loser? No.

226
00:11:53,751 --> 00:11:56,617
I'm talking about this guy who's
19 and never really grew up.

227
00:11:56,684 --> 00:11:58,150
Well, when you care
about someone,

228
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,684
it's not out of line
to give them a gentle push

229
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:01,951
in the right direction.

230
00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:03,917
Got it. Did you
wash those carrots?

231
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,317
No.

232
00:12:07,951 --> 00:12:10,118
<i>You could have washed them
after you cut them,

233
00:12:10,217 --> 00:12:11,484
but now they're
done for.

234
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,617
Oh!

235
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:16,851
Well, I don't like the looks
of this place, Marge.

236
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:20,384
I don't see any standees
for chips, standees for soda.

237
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,851
I don't see any standees at all!

238
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:25,584
From now on, our family
is eating healthy food

239
00:12:25,651 --> 00:12:28,917
that looks bad on the shelf,
but good in our colon.

240
00:12:28,984 --> 00:12:31,084
Why is that man
carrying a purse?

241
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,617
That's a reusable
grocery bag.

242
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:34,150
This store doesn't
use plastic bags,

243
00:12:34,217 --> 00:12:35,951
because they end
up in the ocean

244
00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:38,018
and upset jellyfish
mating rituals.

245
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:41,450
Stupid horny jellyfish--
neutering our dudes.

246
00:12:42,617 --> 00:12:45,550
Hmm.

247
00:12:45,617 --> 00:12:47,617
Almond butter,
soy milk,

248
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,517
non-soy dairy-based
soy sauce,

249
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:50,951
steel-cut spelt husk,

250
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:54,118
Chef Soy-ar-dee soy-based
spaghetti and soy balls,

251
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:55,984
free-range gluten,

252
00:12:56,051 --> 00:12:57,150
ultra-vegan
invisible cheese...

253
00:12:57,217 --> 00:12:58,283
You know, you don't have

254
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,484
to read the items aloud.

255
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,684
I know what they are.

256
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:04,018
Okay, that comes to $790.

257
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,617
800 bucks?!

258
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,951
Oh, wait. I didn't see
these blueberries.

259
00:13:08,018 --> 00:13:09,283
$830.

260
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,684
Fine, but we're going

261
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:12,584
to a regular grocery store
next week.

262
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:14,051
A week?

263
00:13:14,118 --> 00:13:16,084
Without preservatives,
this food won't last a day.

264
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,018
Look.

265
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:20,917
Oh!

266
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:26,484
Huh.

267
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,018
<i>Well, I guess, uh,
they can go either way.

268
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,717
Oh, God!

269
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:35,217
Oh, I'm in
horrible pain!

270
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:40,984
Andy, man,
is this the way

271
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:43,384
you want to spend
the rest of your life?

272
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,150
Having to borrow spray paint
from a ten-year-old kid?

273
00:13:46,217 --> 00:13:47,450
I told you, okay?

274
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:49,984
I'll pay you back when
I get my allowance.

275
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:52,517
I mean, not this one,
but the one after next.

276
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:55,317
Oh, God,
you're right.

277
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:57,617
Look, I think
I can get you a job.

278
00:13:57,684 --> 00:13:59,051
Krusty owes me a favor

279
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:01,517
after I perjured myself for him
during a deposition.

280
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:03,851
You would get me a job?
Thank you, man.

281
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:06,283
Um, I would keep that on
for the interview.

282
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:13,617
Hey, hey, if it isn't
my old friend... you!

283
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:15,183
Krusty, I need a favor.

284
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,617
For you kid, anything,

285
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:17,851
anything at all!

286
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:18,951
Although I won't
read screenplays.

287
00:14:19,018 --> 00:14:20,183
That's for your protection.

288
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,417
Oh, and you can't ride
on my private jet.

289
00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:25,283
And I won't give a struggling
young comic his first chance,

290
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,484
I won't give a broken-down hack
his last chance,

291
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,118
I won't buy you kids booze.

292
00:14:29,183 --> 00:14:30,884
The judge was very clear
on that.

293
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:32,684
Now, what can I do for you?

294
00:14:32,751 --> 00:14:34,817
Oh, and I don't sign footballs
unless you're dying,

295
00:14:34,884 --> 00:14:37,851
and it reverts back to me after
six months if you're not dead.

296
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:41,051
As my new second assistant,

297
00:14:41,118 --> 00:14:43,951
you've got to drive me
from my office to the stage,

298
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:46,751
and if you see anybody
I've screwed over on the way,

299
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:47,917
avoid them!

300
00:14:47,984 --> 00:14:49,084
Whoa! Ex-wife!

301
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,250
Former writing partner!

302
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:51,617
Bookie!

303
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:53,517
Dog I abandoned!
A.A. sponsor!

304
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:54,784
Love child!

305
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:56,051
Tiddly.
Wink.

306
00:14:56,118 --> 00:14:57,484
Tiddly.

307
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,784
Wink. Didn't Andy
start work today?

308
00:14:59,851 --> 00:15:01,084
Yes. Tiddly.

309
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,118
Then why is he standing
in our driveway?

310
00:15:03,183 --> 00:15:04,317
Wink.

311
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:06,784
You're supposed
to be at work!

312
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:09,517
I tried, man, but he was, like,
"Do this thing."

313
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:10,817
And I'm, like, "Why, dude?"

314
00:15:10,884 --> 00:15:12,317
And he's, like, "I'm your boss!"

315
00:15:12,384 --> 00:15:13,984
And I'm, like, "I quit."

316
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:16,283
Then you're, like, "You're
supposed to be at work, man."

317
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,517
Then I'm, like, "What?"

318
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,751
You quit after one day?

319
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,051
Yeah.

320
00:15:20,118 --> 00:15:21,651
But today wasn't
a total loss.

321
00:15:21,717 --> 00:15:23,417
On the way home,
I got this--

322
00:15:23,484 --> 00:15:25,751
an ice cube with
a fly in it.

323
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:26,984
If that was in your drink,

324
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,283
you'd be, like,
"I'm not drinking that!"

325
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,118
I stuck my neck out for you,
and you screwed it up!

326
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,550
We're not losers!

327
00:15:33,617 --> 00:15:35,051
No, you two
are winners.

328
00:15:35,118 --> 00:15:36,250
Big winners.

329
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:37,817
When I grow up,

330
00:15:37,884 --> 00:15:40,283
I want to marry a big
winner like you guys.

331
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,317
Shut up!

332
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:46,617
* Doggies and kitties
don't last forever *

333
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:50,951
* But they do a lot better
than fish! *

334
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,817
* Flush, flush, fish,
fish, fish, flush... *

335
00:15:54,884 --> 00:15:56,517
It's healthy
snack time!

336
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,750
Is it?

337
00:15:57,817 --> 00:15:59,517
We've got sulfite-free
grape juice

338
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,650
and homemade, organic,
non-gluten,

339
00:16:01,717 --> 00:16:03,884
fair-trade zucchini cupcakes!

340
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:04,984
Oh!
Oh!

341
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,550
They don't rise by themselves,

342
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:08,184
so I was up all night

343
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:10,284
blowing air bubbles into them
with a straw.

344
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:12,351
Mmm! Delicious!

345
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:15,318
What percent milk fat
unsalted butter did you use

346
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:16,984
to grease the cupcake tray?

347
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:18,517
None percent.

348
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,384
I used a nonstick pan.

349
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:27,051
Don't you know that nonstick
pans are made with P.F.O.A.s?

350
00:16:27,117 --> 00:16:29,318
Oh, boy, here it comes.

351
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:32,951
There is only one thing more
dangerous than P.F.O.A.s, Marge.

352
00:16:33,017 --> 00:16:34,884
Plastics made with B.P.A.s.

353
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:38,384
Never, ever let your child near
any product with the number...

354
00:16:40,617 --> 00:16:41,850
Seven!

355
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:45,384
Good Lord,
they've been sucking seven! Oh!

356
00:17:04,217 --> 00:17:05,384
All right, Andy.

357
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,017
It was not easy
to get your job back.

358
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:08,850
You did me a solid, man.

359
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:11,318
And I promise you,
I will not leave this job

360
00:17:11,384 --> 00:17:13,750
unless I flake
or it becomes bogus.

361
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:15,318
No, that's not
good enough.

362
00:17:15,384 --> 00:17:17,550
I want you to shake my hand
as a fellow prankster

363
00:17:17,617 --> 00:17:19,650
and swear you will
try your best.

364
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:20,717
Psych!
Psych!

365
00:17:20,784 --> 00:17:21,917
We have a deal.

366
00:17:25,284 --> 00:17:26,550
Marge?

367
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:28,517
Sorry I'm late.
I was working overtime,

368
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,217
so we'd have extra money
to buy fruit salad.

369
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:35,650
Honey, what are
you doing?
Hmm?

370
00:17:35,717 --> 00:17:36,917
Nothing!

371
00:17:36,984 --> 00:17:39,151
Nothing!

372
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:40,850
It's okay.
You can tell me.

373
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:44,750
I found your stash.

374
00:17:45,984 --> 00:17:50,418
You found the precious!

375
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:52,318
I know, I know.

376
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:54,151
I've eaten
your trans fats,

377
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:55,784
your red dye number two.

378
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,984
Even this!

379
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,583
Oh, Marge, I'm seeing

380
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,717
a brand-new
side of you-- me.

381
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,850
More Lard Glug, my sweet?

382
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:11,017
I never want to stop.

383
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:12,717
Did you know
that Lard Glug

384
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:15,151
contains neither
lard nor glug?

385
00:18:15,217 --> 00:18:16,583
From now on,

386
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,784
we'll only make
the kids eat healthy.

387
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,284
I can't believe
Andy's lasted a week.

388
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,384
Yeah, to congratulate him,
I got him the most

389
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,418
grown-up thing I could
think of: a Caesar salad.

390
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:29,984
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Stage 6.

391
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:33,251
I've got a delivery
for a Mr. Andy Hamilton.

392
00:18:33,318 --> 00:18:34,750
Right over there.
Oh, thank you.

393
00:18:48,017 --> 00:18:50,051
Louie, have you
seen Andy?

394
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:51,717
I think he's gonna
ruin the show!

395
00:18:51,784 --> 00:18:53,784
Eh, he's about
20 seasons too late.

396
00:19:07,418 --> 00:19:09,251
Now, to dive in this pool

397
00:19:09,318 --> 00:19:10,750
of clear, blue water.

398
00:19:21,784 --> 00:19:23,017
Put me down!

399
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:24,051
You're ruining the bit!

400
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:25,884
No! I won't see you end up

401
00:19:25,951 --> 00:19:28,517
like Skinner,
twisted and deranged.

402
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,384
<i>Watch the Krusty Show,
they tell me.

403
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,450
You'll forget
your troubles, they tell me.

404
00:19:32,517 --> 00:19:34,184
Uh, how much
do you weigh?

405
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:36,917
Oh, 180, maybe 190.

406
00:19:36,984 --> 00:19:39,384
Plus I'm wearing about 30
pounds of pancake makeup

407
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,617
and I'm always packing heat.

408
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:44,051
Plus the owner's manual
for my Cadillac.

409
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:58,750
I wanted warm water,
not worm water.

410
00:20:04,318 --> 00:20:05,650
What's going on?

411
00:20:05,717 --> 00:20:06,817
Krusty needed a bit.

412
00:20:06,884 --> 00:20:08,318
And I got a great one.

413
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:11,384
Thanks to my new
head writer, Andy Hamilton.

414
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:14,884
Bart, thank you for believing
I could grow up.

415
00:20:14,951 --> 00:20:16,917
My pranking days
are over, for good.

416
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:18,650
What's gotten into you, man?

417
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,850
Andrew, I wanted
to show you something

418
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:23,483
in the make-out room--
uh, makeup room.

419
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,784
I'll be right there
in a minute, babe.

420
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,051
Looks like I just bought
some property on Boner Way.

421
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:32,117
So now Andy's a TV writer.

422
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:34,084
Loser.

423
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:38,418
<i>* Loser, loser. *

424
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:40,251
<i>Loser!
