00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:25,069
¶ for he's a jolly good fellow ¶

3
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:30,241
¶ which nobody can deny ¶

4
00:01:30,308 --> 00:01:33,210
¶ except his ex-wife. ¶

5
00:01:33,278 --> 00:01:34,678
(all laughing)

6
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:36,213
So what are you going to do
without us numskulls

7
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:37,648
To supervise?

8
00:01:37,716 --> 00:01:40,584
I plan to fill the void
with gardening, early dining,

9
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:43,254
And I've been learning
to speak mandarin chinese.

10
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:45,022
(speaking pseudo-mandarin)

11
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,091
That's garbage,
that's total garbage.

12
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,459
(homer humming)

13
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:49,660
I'm going to miss ted.

14
00:01:49,728 --> 00:01:51,328
He was a good
supervisor.

15
00:01:51,396 --> 00:01:52,396
Definitely
hands-off.

16
00:01:52,464 --> 00:01:53,831
He didn't mind
if we punched in

17
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:55,299
A little late
or not at all.

18
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:58,736
Or that we made a few
adjustments to the soda machine.

19
00:01:58,804 --> 00:02:00,538
(all laugh)

20
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:01,539
Carl:
Yeah.

21
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:02,406
Homer:
Beer.

22
00:02:03,642 --> 00:02:07,878
Here's to us--
the unsupervisables.

23
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:09,180
(groans)

24
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:10,915
I expect you're all
anxiously awaiting

25
00:02:10,982 --> 00:02:13,150
My choice
for your new supervisor.

26
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:16,220
Can't we just all supervise
ourselves?

27
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:18,656
(all giggling excitedly)

28
00:02:19,858 --> 00:02:21,759
(tires screeching)

29
00:02:31,203 --> 00:02:33,170
I win!

30
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:35,206
In any event,

31
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:38,109
Much as what formerly was
my kidney is now my heart,

32
00:02:38,176 --> 00:02:40,311
I have decided
to promote from within.

33
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:42,847
One of you will get the job.

34
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:45,316
But which one?

35
00:02:45,383 --> 00:02:47,718
(fly buzzing)

36
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:50,754
(guzzling)

37
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:51,989
Aah!

38
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:56,393
(electrical buzzing)

39
00:02:58,363 --> 00:02:59,430
Hmm...

40
00:02:59,498 --> 00:03:01,031
Congratulations.

41
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:03,467
I dub thee king
of the morons,

42
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:06,137
Also known as supervisor
for sector 7-g.

43
00:03:06,204 --> 00:03:09,340
Here is your key to
the executive washroom.

44
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:10,541
Hmm.

45
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:16,147
Lenny & homer:
Whoo-hoo!

46
00:03:16,214 --> 00:03:18,082
Our boss is our best buddy.

47
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,117
The nitwits are running
the goofhouse.

48
00:03:20,185 --> 00:03:21,952
Yeah.

49
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,754
Hey, carl, why aren't you
high-fiving?

50
00:03:23,822 --> 00:03:26,290
You know, I'd rather
save my arm-lifting

51
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:29,627
For tapping gauges or filling
out employee evaluations.

52
00:03:29,694 --> 00:03:30,961
We can celebrate
at moe's.

53
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:32,530
(delighted whooping)

54
00:03:32,597 --> 00:03:33,531
After work.

55
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:34,932
(both groan)

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,935
And the first beer's on me.

57
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:39,537
You see, he
hasn't changed.

58
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:40,971
Carl (over p.A.):
Yes, I have,

59
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,074
In ways you're only beginning
to suspect.

60
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:45,943
(clinking)

61
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:47,811
I call to order
this meeting

62
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,481
Of the springfield
charity chicks.

63
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:53,617
As you all know, last year's
cake and cookie sale raised

64
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:58,255
$112 to fight childhood obesity.

65
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:01,625
(moans)

66
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:03,928
Thank you, charity chicks.

67
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:06,063
Whoa!

68
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,265
Now, who has ideas

69
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,000
For this year's fundraiser?

70
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:12,136
Well, the police department
raised money

71
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:13,737
By selling
these beefcake calendars.

72
00:04:13,805 --> 00:04:14,772
Ooh, that's quite
a thing.

73
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:15,806
Mrs. Skinner:
Yeah, great.

74
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:25,516
I have a
great idea.

75
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:27,484
Let's do what they
did but with us.

76
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:29,553
We are
a good-looking bunch.

77
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:31,789
(excited chatter)

78
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:33,624
We just need a theme.

79
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:34,959
Hmm.

80
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:37,628
Ah!

81
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:38,896
How about history?

82
00:04:38,964 --> 00:04:40,998
(overlapping chatter)

83
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:42,032
Then it's set.

84
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,534
We'll do it on the 25th of...

85
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:44,802
(groans)

86
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,370
...Wiggum.

87
00:04:46,438 --> 00:04:48,439
(camera shutter clicking)

88
00:04:48,506 --> 00:04:52,343
Okay, betsy ross,
bring history to life.

89
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,744
Ooh, I love it.

90
00:04:53,812 --> 00:04:55,212
Don't stop, don't
stop, don't stop.

91
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,747
Okay, stop, we got plenty.

92
00:04:56,815 --> 00:04:59,783
All right, who's my next
sexy historical lady?

93
00:04:59,851 --> 00:05:00,884
I am.

94
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:03,988
The female tiger woods
of the 1930s--

95
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:06,423
Babe didrikson zaharias.

96
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:09,026
Ooh, you know marge,
if you want to sell calendars,

97
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:10,261
I'm going
to need to see

98
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:13,530
More "babe" and less
"didrikson zaharias."

99
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:16,066
Fine, I'll take
off one glove.

100
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:18,002
Mm-hmm.

101
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,070
Hmm, you know
what would look super good?

102
00:05:20,138 --> 00:05:23,040
If you held
this glass of red wine.

103
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,212
Mmm, I love this wine.

104
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,413
Yeah, it's andalusian.

105
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:31,048
Well, it seems real to me.

106
00:05:31,116 --> 00:05:32,116
(laughs)

107
00:05:32,183 --> 00:05:34,084
Okay, more wine
for you.

108
00:05:34,152 --> 00:05:35,286
(raucous laughter)

109
00:05:38,156 --> 00:05:40,224
(humming)

110
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:41,825
<i>Ooh, that's caliente, baby.</i>

111
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:43,160
Ooh, ooh,

112
00:05:43,228 --> 00:05:45,062
Pop goes the chupacabra.

113
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,864
(marge humming,
camera shutter clicking)

114
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:49,099
Whoop!
Okay.

115
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:51,168
Mmm, oh, meow.

116
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:52,403
Meow, meow, meow.

117
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,006
(humming)

118
00:05:56,074 --> 00:05:57,007
Whoops!

119
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:58,242
(giggling)

120
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:03,547
(homer laughs)

121
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:04,682
Hey, carl,

122
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:05,916
Look how I messed
with the names

123
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:07,451
On the softball
sign-up sheet.

124
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,686
(giggling)

125
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:09,953
It's delicious.

126
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:11,655
You know how smitty's name
is smitty?

127
00:06:11,723 --> 00:06:12,656
(laughs)

128
00:06:12,724 --> 00:06:13,957
Well, not anymore.

129
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,859
I changed the "m" to a...

130
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:16,960
That'll do, homer.

131
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:18,195
...To a "p"--

132
00:06:18,263 --> 00:06:19,596
Spitty, 'cause he
spits when he talks.

133
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:21,398
He had to have part
of his tongue removed.

134
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:22,533
That's real funny.

135
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,901
Oh, well, I
didn't know that.

136
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:25,836
Well, now you know.

137
00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:28,339
Oh, quit dragging me.

138
00:06:28,406 --> 00:06:30,140
When I grow up,
I'm gonna drag you around

139
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,442
And buy you clothes.

140
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,677
Oh, that's wonderful.

141
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:34,678
(groans)

142
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:36,613
What's all the hubbub-aloo?

143
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:38,482
(moans)

144
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,451
(screams)

145
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:42,553
I've been pin-upped.

146
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,022
(groaning)

147
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,857
And every month is me.

148
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:48,225
(gasps)

149
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:49,960
I don't remember
doing this.

150
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:51,295
(gasps)

151
00:06:51,363 --> 00:06:55,165
I certainly don't remember
doing August.

152
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:58,502
Hey, calendar lady, you
gonna take your clothes off?

153
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,603
No.

154
00:06:59,671 --> 00:07:01,705
Well, I got the
next best thing.

155
00:07:01,773 --> 00:07:04,375
(chuckling)

156
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:05,409
Whoo-hoo.

157
00:07:05,477 --> 00:07:08,312
(chuckling)

158
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,589
Great safety report,
homer.

159
00:07:12,657 --> 00:07:14,057
No meltdowns all week.

160
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,227
I'm making you
my new executive assistant.

161
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:20,063
Why can't I keep the job
I have now, whatever it is?

162
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:21,498
Not an option,
big fella.

163
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,368
Either you're my assistant
or you find a job elsewhere,

164
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:27,237
And in this economy,
elsewhere ain't hiring.

165
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:29,540
Oh, fine, I guess
I'm at your beck.

166
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:30,574
And call.

167
00:07:30,642 --> 00:07:31,775
No...!

168
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:32,910
Yeah.

169
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,581
Oh, no,

170
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:39,616
It's a big turnout
at church today,

171
00:07:39,684 --> 00:07:43,353
And the whole congregation has
seen my scandinavian regions.

172
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:47,257
(crowd murmuring)

173
00:07:47,325 --> 00:07:48,992
Here comes the woman
who made February

174
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,161
The hottest month of the year.

175
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:53,797
Her shapely gams
have finally persuaded me

176
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:55,899
To switch from the julian
calendar to the gregorian.

177
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:57,868
Marge, girl,

178
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,270
I just heard
your pants ain't hiring

179
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:02,606
Because your butt won't quit.

180
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:04,908
(sighing)

181
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,679
(groans)

182
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:11,648
Homie, everyone
loved my calendar,

183
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:13,951
But only you get
to flip the pages.

184
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:15,252
Calendar?

185
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,855
Oh, my god, I forgot to move
carl's 12:30 to 2:30.

186
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:20,824
Oh, his astrologist will show up

187
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:23,060
At the same time
as his astronomer.

188
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,095
This is not good,
this is not good.

189
00:08:25,163 --> 00:08:26,430
(moans)

190
00:08:26,497 --> 00:08:29,933
How about a little
marge madness?

191
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:32,135
(horn blowing)

192
00:08:36,674 --> 00:08:40,110
(motor stalling)

193
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:42,913
Oh, who am I kidding?

194
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:50,120
Marge, would you mind
if we just cuddle?

195
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:51,922
Cuddling's for after.

196
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,024
(marge moaning)

197
00:08:54,092 --> 00:08:56,259
(both moaning)

198
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,829
(homer snoring, marge gasping)

199
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:05,102
(mumbling)

200
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,136
(sighs)

201
00:09:06,204 --> 00:09:07,604
Tomorrow, my love.

202
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,273
(groans)

203
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,441
Stupid carl.

204
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,043
"update the phone list,
homer.

205
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:14,177
"you put my
contact lenses in

206
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:15,212
Backwards, homer."

207
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,179
(sighs)

208
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:17,481
I'm sorry, honey.

209
00:09:17,548 --> 00:09:19,783
Maybe this will take
your mind off work.

210
00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:22,252
Wash my car.

211
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,553
Re-foam my latte.

212
00:09:23,621 --> 00:09:24,588
Book me a massage.

213
00:09:24,656 --> 00:09:25,756
Shiatsu or better.

214
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:26,890
(screams)
leave me alone, you two!

215
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,458
(sobbing)

216
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:31,895
(sighs)

217
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:33,497
<i>Mrs. Krabappel:
Class,</i>

218
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:34,765
Today we're going to talk

219
00:09:34,832 --> 00:09:36,400
About washington crossing
the delaware.

220
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:39,369
I'd like to watch bart's mom
washing her underwear.

221
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:41,405
The british were led
by general howe.

222
00:09:41,472 --> 00:09:43,540
I'd give bart's mom
a general wow.

223
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:44,775
Knock it off.

224
00:09:44,842 --> 00:09:46,476
That's my mom you're
talking about.

225
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,212
Keep-away
with bart's mom.

226
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,517
Mrs. S.,
you can tuck me in anytime.

227
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:55,952
Okay, buddy,
lower the eyebrows,

228
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,888
Nice and easy.

229
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,893
Ow!
It's stuck!

230
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,496
I'll have a quizzical expression
for the rest of my life.

231
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,765
I'd like to get quizzical
with bart's mom.

232
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,200
Shut up!

233
00:10:10,268 --> 00:10:11,568
(both grunt)

234
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:13,737
Standing up for yourself
to an older boy?

235
00:10:13,805 --> 00:10:15,172
We're going to
have to set up

236
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,506
An appointment
with your parents.

237
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,176
Let me, uh,
check my calendar.

238
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,544
(chuckles slyly)

239
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:24,614
I'm suddenly feeling, uh,
un-administrative feelings.

240
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:25,582
(both laughing lasciviously)

241
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,583
Yes.

242
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:28,518
(groans)

243
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,188
(floorboards creaking)

244
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,456
Homie?

245
00:10:32,523 --> 00:10:34,691
Honey, I know it's been
a rough couple of weeks,

246
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,960
But I booked us a night
this Saturday

247
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:39,563
At a very
romantic hotel.

248
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,764
Garden view?

249
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:43,700
Ocean view,
obstructed.

250
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,203
(swoons)

251
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,142
All right, I put in
a hundred-hour work week,

252
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,377
But I took a power nap
while I was driving us here

253
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,912
And now I'm rarin' to go.

254
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,417
Well, I brought a few items to
make our night extra special--

255
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:04,254
Massage oil, some lingerie
from the horny hubby,

256
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:06,256
And snuggle dice.

257
00:11:06,324 --> 00:11:09,526
This one has an action
and this one has a body part.

258
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:10,861
See?

259
00:11:10,928 --> 00:11:12,696
"nuzzle... Neck."

260
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:14,731
With pleasure!

261
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,666
Let me try.

262
00:11:16,734 --> 00:11:18,368
"lick... Eyes."

263
00:11:18,436 --> 00:11:19,736
Uh, I'll try again.

264
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,706
"spank... Hair"?

265
00:11:22,774 --> 00:11:23,840
What the...?

266
00:11:23,908 --> 00:11:25,108
(die rattling)

267
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:27,310
"whisper into ass"?

268
00:11:27,378 --> 00:11:29,212
Oh, this game sucks!

269
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,716
Why don't you just roll me?

270
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:34,785
We're gonna be...

271
00:11:34,852 --> 00:11:37,487
(yawns) snore in the morning.

272
00:11:37,555 --> 00:11:40,123
Damn it, why won't
you touch me?

273
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:41,358
Mm... Ooh.

274
00:11:43,194 --> 00:11:44,427
Okay.

275
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,829
Kiss me, baby!

276
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:47,931
Kiss me like a frog
in a fairy tale!

277
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,700
(moaning and squealing)

278
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:53,637
(phone ringing)

279
00:11:56,574 --> 00:11:58,542
Carl:
Great news, homer!

280
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:00,277
I've been invited to the annual

281
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,913
Nuclear-power expo
in paris, France.

282
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,215
That's right,
we're going to fission week!

283
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:06,516
(squealing):
Oh! Whoo-hoo!

284
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:08,351
I need you to book me
a room at the ritz,

285
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:10,086
With a view
of jim morrison's grave

286
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:11,588
And book me dinner
at that place.

287
00:12:11,656 --> 00:12:12,923
You know the one,
the one lenny's mom

288
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,457
Read about two years ago.

289
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,627
(groaning)

290
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:23,099
I'll make it up to you,
marge, I swear.

291
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,435
<i>Last night was the
making it up to me!</i>

292
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:26,837
The most intimate moment

293
00:12:26,904 --> 00:12:29,606
We shared this week was
my ironing your shirts!

294
00:12:29,674 --> 00:12:31,274
Actually, those
were carl's shirts.

295
00:12:31,342 --> 00:12:32,676
Oh!

296
00:12:32,743 --> 00:12:34,110
I can't believe
you're gonna spend

297
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:35,745
Another weekend with him.

298
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:37,647
Hey, it's not like
I want to go.

299
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,249
Go, go, go!

300
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:41,284
No!!

301
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:42,886
(grunting angrily)

302
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:47,591
Diddily...

303
00:12:49,193 --> 00:12:50,560
(gasps)

304
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,942
Okay, fission week
kicks off on Monday

305
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,212
With a reception by the
international proton council.

306
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,549
Word is, protons
are the new electrons.

307
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,485
You know, homer,
when I was your age,

308
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,721
It was the future,
'cause I'm younger than you.

309
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:10,855
Just something
to think about.

310
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,457
I will.
Edamame?

311
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,525
I don't have time for peeling.

312
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,526
Squirt them in.

313
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,665
Well, boys, daddy's
back on the beam,

314
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,535
Thanks to christian prayer
and doctor sheldon lowenstein.

315
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,303
We thought you
were gonna die.

316
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,472
And then uncle kevin
would have to raise us.

317
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,474
With his funny friend, david.

318
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,309
Oh, I'd put rocks
into your pockets

319
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,311
And walk you out to sea
before that happened.

320
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,712
Yay!
Yay!
(doorbell ringing)

321
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,116
Ned, to make up
for what happened,

322
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:39,651
I want to invite
you and the boys

323
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,019
Over to dinner
tomorrow night.

324
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,087
Okily-dokily,
but I'm warning you,

325
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,557
You're gonna see america's
number one dishwashing crew!

326
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,559
I wash!
And I dry!

327
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:51,062
Then I give 'em the squeak test
and into the dishwasher they go.

328
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,030
Oh!

329
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,312
(camera shutters clicking)

330
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:11,616
(photographers clamoring)

331
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,726
Carl carlson, it is
good to meet you.

332
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,294
Thank you, um...

333
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,130
French nuclear commissioner
etienne ducharme.

334
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,532
Commissioner ducharme,

335
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,467
I trust that
your wife is, uh...

336
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,369
(whispering)
...Still dead?

337
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,738
Yes, thank you for asking.

338
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,511
Monsieur carlson, what have
you enjoyed most about paris?

339
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,180
Oh, I really love, uh...

340
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:44,315
(whispering)
the louvre.

341
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,017
Everything about it
is so, uh...

342
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,186
(whispers)
closed on mondays.

343
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:50,321
You are clearly
a man of the world.

344
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,156
May I have your card?

345
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,524
My assistant
will give you that.

346
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,892
Can we meet for lunch?

347
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,294
My assistant
will set that up.

348
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,962
I want to make love, now!

349
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,733
My assistant will do a sensual
dance for your arousal.

350
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,368
Come on, come on, come on,
sensual dance, chop, chop.

351
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,569
Uh, okay.

352
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,472
(humming)

353
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,378
(laughing)

354
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,080
(giggling)

355
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,382
I love paris.

356
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,850
The women, the wine!

357
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:22,353
Everything except their lame-o
version of rock and roll.

358
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:26,157
¶ rock and roll,
rock and roll! ¶

359
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,759
¶ rock and roll! ¶

360
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,327
When we get back to the hotel,

361
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,895
I want you to extend our stay.

362
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,397
Indefinitely.

363
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,632
But I have to get
back to marge.

364
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,635
Homer, we are this close
to selling our power in paris,

365
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,705
Milan, dubai, everywhere
people know good electricity.

366
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,007
But we gotta focus!

367
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,609
Monsieur carl!

368
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,145
Let us stroll down
main street euro-disney!

369
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:50,214
(both laughing)

370
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,084
¶ le sexy rock and roll,
the films of claude chabrol ¶

371
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,020
¶ ooh la la, c'est dommage
everybody eat fromage! ¶

372
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,505
¶ ¶

373
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,878
(siren wailing)

374
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:27,251
(marge as siren):
Homie! Homie! Homie!
Homie! Homie!

375
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,386
(voice trails off):
Homie!

376
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,090
You two are going out?

377
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,758
I thought I told you

378
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,860
The flanderses were
coming over to dinner.

379
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,229
Sorry, I have a tea
party at janey's.

380
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,731
And I'm having
a stink bomb party

381
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,032
At the house
next to janey's.

382
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,633
No connection.

383
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:46,170
Hmm, I guess it'll
just be dinner for four.

384
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,338
(doorbell ringing)

385
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,308
Hi, ned.

386
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,576
Where are the boys?

387
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,111
Oh, they're grounded.

388
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,179
I found out rod watched a
commercial for "grey's anatomy,"

389
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,848
And todd took
a full day to tell me.

390
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,658
It's fun to cook
dinner together.

391
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,695
Homer and I never
do it anymore.

392
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,731
Cook together, that is.

393
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,967
What's the next task
on the old I-dinnerary?

394
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:18,069
You could wash
this iceberg lettuce.

395
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,972
Oh!
Oh!

396
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,408
¶ ¶

397
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,376
(gasping)

398
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,982
Ooh!

399
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:32,183
Oh...

400
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,251
(organ plays)

401
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,619
Oh...

402
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,089
(both moaning ecstatically)

403
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:44,412
<i>(panting)</i>

404
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:46,113
<i>Marge:
Gosh, what a hunk!</i>

405
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:47,581
<i>Flanders:
I'm not thinking straight.</i>

406
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,417
<i>Why did I drink that
wine cooler last month?</i>

407
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:50,751
(oven bell dings)

408
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,586
Dinner's ready!
Dinner's ready!

409
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,222
Saved by the bell
from eternity in hell.

410
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,525
(nervous giggling)

411
00:17:57,592 --> 00:17:59,493
(phone ringing)

412
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:01,629
<i>(whines) bonjour.</i>

413
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:02,863
Homer, there is a moth
in my room!

414
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:04,231
Where are you?

415
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:06,267
Where I should've been
all along.

416
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:07,868
In springfield.

417
00:18:07,936 --> 00:18:09,103
What?! Homer!

418
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,238
Return to the immortal
city of light at once,

419
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:12,573
Or you're fired!

420
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:14,809
Oh, I don't think so.

421
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:15,843
You know that woman
you've been playing

422
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:17,211
"hide the baguette" with?

423
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,547
She's the first lady
of France, carla bruni!

424
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:23,951
If you fire me,
I'll call president sarkozy,

425
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,920
And he'll be all over you
like truffaut on hitchcock.

426
00:18:25,987 --> 00:18:27,888
You wouldn't dare!

427
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:29,423
Oh, wouldn't I?

428
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:30,658
Just listen.

429
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:32,893
(speed-dialing tone)

430
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:35,362
(phone buzzing)

431
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,432
Hello, you are getting
cozy with sarkozy.

432
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,701
Uh... Okay, okay, you win.

433
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:42,269
Give my best to marge.

434
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:43,637
I sure will.

435
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:47,007
But only after I give her mine.

436
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:54,014
Nuclear secrets,
pictures of lenny.

437
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:56,417
Everything I need for my plan!

438
00:18:57,652 --> 00:19:00,087
Marge, that dinner
was a winner!

439
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:01,255
What's for dessert?

440
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:03,057
Oh, nothing fancy.

441
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,658
Just strawberries
and whipped cream.

442
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:12,433
Mmm-mm!

443
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:16,003
Mmm-mm-mm!

444
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:21,275
(slurping)

445
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:23,077
Mmm...

446
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:25,279
(gasps and giggles)

447
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:27,181
Mmm...

448
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,184
Ned, you got whipped cream
in your mustache.

449
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:34,388
Your perfectly
trimmed mustache.

450
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:40,661
Oh, ned, there's
only one man

451
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:42,930
I should be eating
whipped cream with.

452
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:44,965
I never thought otherwise.

453
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:47,935
Well, see you around
the mailbox, marge.

454
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:51,572
My wife?

455
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,407
And my worst friend?

456
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:54,909
Could it be?

457
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:56,811
(growling)

458
00:19:56,878 --> 00:19:58,345
Nah!

459
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:01,715
Homie, you're back!

460
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,451
Hey, ned.

461
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:07,421
Marge, I believe we have
a little unfinished business.

462
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:08,722
Come with me!

463
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,857
Oh!

464
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:12,393
(moaning)

465
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,428
Oh, baby, oh, baby!

466
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:17,531
(moaning passionately)

467
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,767
Marge:
Oh, homer!

468
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:21,402
(shelf rattling, dish breaking)

469
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:35,249
Boy, that was
worth the wait.

470
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,685
<i>Now, it's my turn
to roll the dice!</i>

471
00:20:37,752 --> 00:20:40,521
Want to kiss them for me?

472
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:42,523
Uh-huh.
(kisses)

473
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:43,824
Classic.

474
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:45,059
(chuckles)

475
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:51,932
