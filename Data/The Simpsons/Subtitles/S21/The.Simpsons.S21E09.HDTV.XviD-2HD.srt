2
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:39,210
Oh, I love going to aquatic parks.

3
00:00:39,277 --> 00:00:41,876
Sure, they have worse rides
than amusement parks,

4
00:00:41,944 --> 00:00:45,478
less fish than aquarium
s- but the parking is ample!

5
00:00:49,214 --> 00:00:51,647
Now to seal you in for safety.

6
00:00:54,517 --> 00:00:58,051
Oh, there's so many photo ops,

7
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:00,586
but I already filled up my
camera in the parking lot.

8
00:01:00,654 --> 00:01:03,254
Parking lot C sign, the tram,

9
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:04,821
a license plate from Canada,

10
00:01:04,889 --> 00:01:06,923
a bird eating potato chips,

11
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,190
my feet walking,

12
00:01:08,257 --> 00:01:10,324
that boy who got sick on the tram,

13
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:12,258
Grampa talking to a mermaid hedge,

14
00:01:12,326 --> 00:01:14,160
the park rules in Spanish,

15
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:15,662
a fat baby,

16
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,064
Grampa telling a story to a trailer hitch.

17
00:01:18,132 --> 00:01:20,700
Oops! I erased them all!

18
00:01:22,137 --> 00:01:23,604
I want to do that!

19
00:01:27,306 --> 00:01:29,007
I'm going to take stuff
from the lost and found!

20
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:35,945
My feet hurt!

21
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,614
left ear's freezing!

22
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,114
My right ear's burning!

23
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,150
I got fish smell in my wrinkles!

24
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,686
Attention, exploro-nauts!

25
00:01:44,753 --> 00:01:45,853
That's us!

26
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:47,620
In one minute, we'll be starting

27
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:50,719
our rock-quatic roll-tacular!

28
00:01:50,787 --> 00:01:53,219
Hurry! If we don't get a
seat in the splash zone,

29
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:55,722
I've worn my bathing suit
under my clothes for nothing!

30
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:57,489
A splash-'em-up show?

31
00:01:57,557 --> 00:02:01,192
Reminds me of the time I hig
h-dived into a damp sponge

32
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,930
for the amusement of Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker.

33
00:02:04,998 --> 00:02:07,032
Grampa, no stories!

34
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:09,832
You can come with us,
or sit here on the shark bench.

35
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,333
You know, I did sit on a shark once...

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,867
d, bathing suit!

37
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:17,169
Oops! No bathing suit.

38
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,403
* *

39
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,271
Let's give a wet and wacky welcome

40
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:23,374
to Springfield's oldest
performing mollusk...

41
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:24,808
Get to the show!

42
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:26,376
This is the show!

43
00:02:26,444 --> 00:02:29,712
Here's the original Octomom: Slimu!

44
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:34,215
* Whoa! *

45
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:36,217
* I feel good *

46
00:02:37,686 --> 00:02:38,619
* I knew that I would... *

47
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:40,521
Slimu! Did you get my letters?

48
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:42,656
Slimu wasn't expecting company,

49
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:44,791
so he's got some cleaning up to do!

50
00:02:44,858 --> 00:02:47,459
*...I wouldn't now *

51
00:02:47,527 --> 00:02:49,160
* So good *

52
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,232
Slimu looks kind of uncomfortable.

53
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:57,300
Wouldn't you be if you were a saltwater fish

54
00:02:57,368 --> 00:02:59,436
in a freshwater aquarium?

55
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:02,238
The country has its first black president.

56
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:05,340
Maybe it's time for the
first octopus president!

57
00:03:08,744 --> 00:03:10,644
And when it comes to signing bills,

58
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:12,546
he can provide his own ink!

59
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:16,983
Ahh, oily!

60
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:22,621
They'll cheer a dancing octopus,

61
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:26,557
but not an old man
complaining about everything.

62
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,859
Excuse me, sir. Is this seat taken?

63
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:31,761
Well, not for a pretty girl like you!

64
00:03:33,765 --> 00:03:36,232
Well, this is the first
time I ever sat on a shark.

65
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,634
Not me-- sat on a real one once!

66
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:40,168
Tell me more! More?!

67
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:43,070
<i>Play it cool, Grampa.</i>

68
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:45,105
<i>Play it cool!</i>

69
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:47,340
<i>It was back in World War II.</i>

70
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:49,409
<i>I was a Seaman First Class</i>

71
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:51,978
<i>on the USS World War I.</i>

72
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:53,679
<i>We were minding our own business</i>

73
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:56,248
<i>when we were attacked by a hea
t-seeking torpedo</i>

74
00:03:56,315 --> 00:03:59,083
<i>we had fired the day before.</i>

75
00:04:06,857 --> 00:04:08,624
Don't worry about the sharks, boys.

76
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:11,559
Just play possum and
they'll leave you alone.

77
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,894
<i>Unfortunately, sharks love possum.</i>

78
00:04:18,162 --> 00:04:21,396
Hey, boys, these sharks can't
bite us if we're on their backs!

79
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:23,397
Yeah.

80
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:26,299
It's like riding the Cyclone
back at Coney Island!

81
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:27,633
Whoa!

82
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,637
It's like riding a dust devil back in Yuma--

83
00:04:29,705 --> 00:04:32,307
like I read about in a book back in Boston!

84
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,743
<i>By the time the rescue planes came,</i>

85
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,343
<i>we had those sharks trained
pretty good.</i>

86
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:47,050
I still keep in touch with all those men

87
00:04:47,118 --> 00:04:48,485
and some of the sharks.

88
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:50,921
Why, here's us in Hawaii last year.

89
00:04:50,988 --> 00:04:53,689
Good times.

90
00:04:53,757 --> 00:04:55,791
Sir, my name is Marshall Goldman.

91
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:57,726
I'm a newspaper columnist

92
00:04:57,794 --> 00:05:00,195
specializing in human interest stories.

93
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:01,429
You're in the newspaper business?

94
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:04,766
Something that's gonna die before I do!

95
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,935
You have any other stories
you'd care to tell me?

96
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:09,270
Someone's listening to me!

97
00:05:09,337 --> 00:05:12,773
Now I know how a radio feels!

98
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:17,077
Well, class, it's Friday afternoon.

99
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:19,410
That means it's time to find
out which one of you gets

100
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:21,909
to take Larry the Lamb home for the weekend.

101
00:05:21,977 --> 00:05:22,843
Oh! Oh! Oh!

102
00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:24,076
And don't forget,

103
00:05:24,144 --> 00:05:26,379
the lucky student gets
to add his or her page

104
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:28,313
to Larry's personal journal.

105
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:31,082
Just like Martin did last week.

106
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,150
Ha!

107
00:05:32,218 --> 00:05:34,219
I want him first! No, me!

108
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:36,754
Oh, not that stupid stuffed lamb again.

109
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:37,789
This isn't learning!

110
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:39,157
Do you want to learn?

111
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:40,958
No, no, no. I'm just saying...

112
00:05:41,026 --> 00:05:42,126
This weekend,

113
00:05:42,193 --> 00:05:45,029
Larry will go home with...

114
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:47,465
Please, God, I need this.

115
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:48,967
...Bart Simpson.

116
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:52,537
Oh, cruel irony!

117
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:54,973
Hey, the only thing I bring
home are notes to my parents,

118
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,042
and those do not arrive
the way that they left.

119
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,077
Hmm.

120
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:02,979
Oh, what a nice note!

121
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:05,581
I'm not sticking my hand in that can again.

122
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:06,849
You're getting the lamb.

123
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:11,355
Not so fast.

124
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:14,158
Tell the diary how special
he makes you feel!

125
00:06:16,328 --> 00:06:19,264
More adjectives!

126
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:20,698
That's an adverb!

127
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,574
Top of the morning, Homer.

128
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:32,675
Seen the paper?

129
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:34,809
No, I get my news off the Internet.

130
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:40,212
Well, sir, it looks like your
dad is a quotable notable.

131
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,547
Huh?

132
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:45,049
That's a... It's funny.

133
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:46,584
It's poignant...

134
00:06:46,652 --> 00:06:47,819
It actually happened!

135
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:49,988
My father is interesting?!

136
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:52,391
The whole world's upside down!

137
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,526
<i>That must mean Cathy is funny.</i>

138
00:06:54,593 --> 00:06:55,793
Nope.

139
00:06:57,328 --> 00:06:59,629
Abe, I never knew you were so full of...

140
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:01,631
! What does that mean?

141
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:02,998
It's like ,

142
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:05,500
but with a pinch more !

143
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:07,569
Yep, I may just be

144
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,872
the best known Abraham in history.

145
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,607
So, Abe, what else you got for me?

146
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:13,442
Hmm, well, let's see.

147
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,345
Ooh, I was working as a shoeshine boy

148
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:19,247
at Springfield Union Station.

149
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,079
* *

150
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:28,216
<i>Every Monday, the Tinseltown
Starliner would stop</i>

151
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:30,784
<i>at 1:17 p.m. on its way to Hollywood.</i>

152
00:07:30,852 --> 00:07:32,748
<i>I never rode that train,</i>

153
00:07:32,816 --> 00:07:35,218
<i>but I'd palaver with the movie stars</i>

154
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:38,087
<i>when they got out to
stretch their legs.</i>

155
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:39,988
Hiya!

156
00:07:57,938 --> 00:08:00,538
<i>But none was more memorable than...</i>

157
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:01,706
Clark Gable!

158
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:03,541
Looks like someone has seen my work

159
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,376
<i>as an extra in Du Barry, Woman Of
Passion.</i>

160
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,710
I sure have, Mr. Gable.

161
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,778
How come you ain't a star yet?

162
00:08:08,846 --> 00:08:10,512
Maybe my ears are too big. I don't know.

163
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:14,084
Hey, what you reading there? Oh, it's called

164
00:08:14,152 --> 00:08:15,654
<i>Gone with the Wind. You can have it.</i>

165
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:18,091
It's only got one swear word,
and not a very good one.

166
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:19,392
<i>Gone with the Wind, eh?</i>

167
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,761
Well, let's see: garbage, garbage, my line.

168
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:23,497
Garbage, garbage, my line.

169
00:08:23,564 --> 00:08:25,399
Atlanta burns, nice dresses. I like it!

170
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:27,467
Thanks, kid.

171
00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:30,336
Don't tell this story
to anyone for 60 years.

172
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:34,473
"Clark Gable owes me a book.

173
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,575
"And he never paid me for the shoeshine.

174
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:39,110
"But his big blue eyes could melt the butter

175
00:08:39,178 --> 00:08:40,845
"you kept in your pocket for lunch.

176
00:08:40,913 --> 00:08:42,647
Lunch butter we called it."

177
00:08:42,715 --> 00:08:45,783
How come Grampa never shared
those stories with us?

178
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:47,184
He does all the time.

179
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:48,352
You just never listen.

180
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:50,620
Marge, my brain is like a computer,

181
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:54,456
and I file away Grampa's stories
in a very special place.

182
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:01,062
Hmm, while I'm up there.

183
00:09:10,371 --> 00:09:11,571
Uh-oh.

184
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:17,476
That's it, boy! Go for the nards!

185
00:09:17,543 --> 00:09:18,810
Bart!

186
00:09:18,878 --> 00:09:20,512
If you're not gonna take care of him right,

187
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:22,079
then give him to me.

188
00:09:22,147 --> 00:09:24,581
How come you don't get mad
when I torment real animals?

189
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,949
I do! It enrages me!

190
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:29,585
I thought you Hindus were
supposed to love everybody.

191
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,188
I'm a freaking Buddhist!

192
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:32,323
A Buddhist!

193
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:37,594
Larry, please don't judge
our whole family by Bart.

194
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:38,995
He's the black sheep.

195
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:40,663
I mean, not that black sheep

196
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:42,331
are in any way inferior to white sheep.

197
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,933
I do not judge wool by its color--

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,768
only by how itchy it is.

199
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:46,902
Ooh, look!

200
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,203
Jazz!

201
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:51,272
Larry, what sub-genre of jazz do you like?

202
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,940
Fusion? Neo-bop?

203
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:54,308
Afro-Cuban?

204
00:09:55,877 --> 00:09:57,611
Larry!

205
00:09:57,678 --> 00:10:00,313
Gotcha!

206
00:10:01,815 --> 00:10:03,750
Larry? Oh, Larry?

207
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:04,984
Larry?

208
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:06,885
Larry?!

209
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:10,455
You're coming off desperate, honey.

210
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:13,892
That's how I got my idea
for a suitcase with wheels,

211
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:16,662
from watching a commercial
about a suitcase with wheels.

212
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:19,331
Hey, Abe,

213
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,799
great stories.

214
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:23,132
<i>I'm Mitch Albom, author of
Tuesdays with Morrie.</i>

215
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,466
Never heard of you.

216
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:26,001
Yeah. Sure you haven't.

217
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:28,436
Take a hike, Hollywood.

218
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,037
I've already got a college boy

219
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:32,874
to turn my every word into syndicated gold.

220
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:35,009
Yeah, beat it, sports page.

221
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:37,679
And what if I don't?

222
00:10:49,554 --> 00:10:53,021
Clouds are God's sneezes.

223
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:54,556
Ooh, I like this kid.

224
00:10:59,662 --> 00:11:02,530
Oh, Dad, I got you some Scotch.

225
00:11:02,598 --> 00:11:03,995
One of those fancy ones

226
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,396
the checkout lady had to
unlock the cabinet to get.

227
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:07,830
Well, well, well,

228
00:11:07,898 --> 00:11:10,965
look who decided to visit
me twice in one year.

229
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:14,000
This man's more of a son to
me than you've ever been.

230
00:11:14,068 --> 00:11:15,668
What the...?!

231
00:11:15,736 --> 00:11:18,872
Well, he's more of a father
to me than you've ever been!

232
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,341
I don't think that's true.

233
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:21,376
Stay out of this, Dad.

234
00:11:21,444 --> 00:11:23,077
Uh, no. O-Okay.

235
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:25,913
You only care about me
now because I'm famous.

236
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:27,047
That's it.

237
00:11:27,115 --> 00:11:28,582
Here's your ring back.

238
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:29,817
Ring? What ring?

239
00:11:29,884 --> 00:11:31,622
It's a father-son commitment band

240
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,657
that I bought and never told you about.

241
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:40,295
And now I'm telling you.

242
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:45,860
Okay, I need the stupid lamb back.

243
00:11:45,928 --> 00:11:47,463
He's in here, safe and sound.

244
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,467
Let me just staple that bag for you.

245
00:11:54,974 --> 00:11:56,741
Hmm.

246
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:58,075
This isn't Larry.

247
00:11:58,142 --> 00:12:00,276
It's just cotton balls
on toilet paper rolls.

248
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,444
Where's the real Larry?

249
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:03,011
Well, what do you care?

250
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:04,513
You don't even like him.

251
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:06,781
<i>Of course I don't,
but other people do.</i>

252
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:09,150
Hey, Bart, can't wait to see Larry again.

253
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:12,786
Um, what if someone were to lose Larry?

254
00:12:12,854 --> 00:12:16,489
They'd see a dark side
of me no one knows about.

255
00:12:16,557 --> 00:12:18,557
* Nelson loved a little lamb *

256
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,492
* Little lamb, little lamb *

257
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,730
* Nelson loved a little lamb *

258
00:12:23,797 --> 00:12:26,766
* He kept me nice and sane. *

259
00:12:33,138 --> 00:12:34,238
You've reached Abe.

260
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:35,606
And Marshall.

261
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:37,874
Abe can't come to the phone right now.

262
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:40,776
And if this is Homer,
you're too late for my love.

263
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,245
Stupid Grampa.

264
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:45,280
I try to end the cycle of neglect,

265
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,382
and he hits me with some super neglect.

266
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,551
Maybe you're not really mad at Grampa.

267
00:12:49,618 --> 00:12:51,052
Maybe you're mad at yourself

268
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:53,554
for taking him for granted all these years.

269
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:55,556
Marge, how can anyone be mad at himself?

270
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:57,458
It's impossible. Watch.

271
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,026
Why, you little...

272
00:12:59,094 --> 00:13:00,861
Oh, I can't.

273
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:03,530
When I look at those
beautiful chubby cheeks.

274
00:13:03,598 --> 00:13:04,731
Come here, you.

275
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,599
Ow!

276
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:08,868
Ow! I'll kill you, you son of a...!

277
00:13:08,936 --> 00:13:10,804
Oh. No, no, don't-don't look hurt.

278
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:12,138
Okay. It's okay.

279
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:13,372
It's okay.

280
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,974
I'll show Grampa.

281
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,842
I'll find my own surrogate father

282
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:19,908
full of heart-warming stories
I can share with the world.

283
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:23,111
And that's how you win an opium war.

284
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:25,113
Oh, great stuff.

285
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:26,581
And the life lesson is?

286
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:29,716
The Yangtze River swallows all secrets.

287
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:31,084
Hmm.

288
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:33,787
I'm just gonna put "Haste makes waste."

289
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,023
Yes, although, these days,
I can make neither haste nor waste.

290
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,524
You know, Simpson,

291
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:40,525
this has truly been a lovely afternoon.

292
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:42,527
Release... a hound.

293
00:13:43,728 --> 00:13:45,962
Isn't that cute?

294
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,697
He thinks he's a pack.

295
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,333
Where'd you get this rope?

296
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:53,334
Swiped it from gym class.

297
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:54,535
Climb that rope!

298
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:58,239
There is no rope.

299
00:13:58,307 --> 00:14:00,240
Well, you better get to the ceiling somehow!

300
00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:03,143
Ceiling, ceiling, ceiling!

301
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:07,214
Bart, I'm losing my grip.

302
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:08,816
Put the rope in your teeth.

303
00:14:08,883 --> 00:14:10,350
What will that do?

304
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:11,584
It'll shut you up.

305
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,853
Hmm.

306
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,153
Larry?

307
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:18,821
Larry the Lamb?

308
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:21,156
There you are, you piece of crap.

309
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:24,391
There's rats in my pants!

310
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:27,326
Chief, my brother fell in the storm drain!

311
00:14:27,394 --> 00:14:30,862
Um, I'm strictly an abov
e-the-ground policeman.

312
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:32,596
What you need is the sewer cops.

313
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,930
Fine. What's their number?

314
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,198
Lisa, you're old enough now

315
00:14:35,265 --> 00:14:36,832
that I can tell you the truth.

316
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,834
There's no such thing as the sewer cops.

317
00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:41,640
It's just something we tell
kids to make them feel safe.

318
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,142
What about Bart?

319
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,678
Well, if you miss him, yell into a toilet.

320
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:49,148
BART : It's dark down here!

321
00:14:51,852 --> 00:14:54,721
I have a column I'd like to submit.

322
00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:56,090
Pay me whenever.

323
00:14:56,157 --> 00:14:57,925
I'll just take this to our editor.

324
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:04,423
Hmm.

325
00:15:09,196 --> 00:15:11,098
What?

326
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:14,802
Pulitzer Prize application form?

327
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,671
<i>"When I rode with Abe Simpson on
t Tinseltown Starliner,</i>

328
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:22,441
"I never dreamed his first
voyage would be his last?

329
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:24,509
"At 3:00 on Monday,

330
00:15:24,577 --> 00:15:26,343
Abe passed away peacefully in his sleep."

331
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:31,614
How would he know Grampa
was going to die today?

332
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,951
Unless he was going to kill him!

333
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,752
But would someone really kill a man

334
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,854
just to win a Pulitzer Prize?

335
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:53,638
<i>All aboard the final run of the Tinseltown
Starliner,</i>

336
00:15:53,706 --> 00:15:56,440
the last ride into a nostalgic past.

337
00:15:56,508 --> 00:15:58,542
Anyone without a ticket will be beaten

338
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:00,243
by classic railroad bulls.

339
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:04,013
* Old Dan Tucker was a fine old man *

340
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,681
* He washed his face in the frying pan *

341
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:08,483
* He combed his hair with a wagon wheel *

342
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,085
* And died of the toothache in his heel. *

343
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:12,987
You don't get a beatin' like
this traveling by plane.

344
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,255
Ow!

345
00:16:14,323 --> 00:16:17,125
<i>I'm finally riding the Tinseltown
Starliner.</i>

346
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:19,594
I could die a happy man.

347
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:35,306
D'oh!

348
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:38,308
Drink up, Abe.

349
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,576
Live each moment as if
someone's about to kill you.

350
00:16:40,643 --> 00:16:41,777
I mean,

351
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:43,778
as if it's your last.

352
00:16:43,846 --> 00:16:46,013
Sorry, my hearing aid's on the fritz.

353
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:48,749
The only word I heard was "kill."

354
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:54,491
Hey. Aah.

355
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,760
Look at that.

356
00:16:56,828 --> 00:16:58,929
They've recreated the '30s.

357
00:16:58,996 --> 00:17:01,564
Tent cities, failing banks.

358
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:02,865
No, those are real.

359
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:07,836
Oh!

360
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:09,504
Beware of Marshall Goldman!

361
00:17:09,572 --> 00:17:11,072
What was that?

362
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,308
Um, an elephant on a circus train

363
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,709
bellowing for his mother.

364
00:17:14,777 --> 00:17:17,312
Oh, I remember the first time

365
00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:20,247
an elephant tried to eat me like a peanut.

366
00:17:20,315 --> 00:17:23,317
I was on the set of a
Warner Brothers cartoon.

367
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:25,219
Jack Warner came by and said...

368
00:17:28,222 --> 00:17:29,956
Hey, Slimu!

369
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,960
Huh?

370
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:37,430
Yeah, you'd better run!

371
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:40,032
Sewer cats!

372
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:45,001
Larry?!

373
00:17:47,537 --> 00:17:49,205
Larry, you saved my life!

374
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:51,707
You're the most wonderful
stuffed lamb in the world.

375
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:53,041
I'm sorry about the mean things I said,

376
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:54,976
and we'll have the rest of the weekend to...

377
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:56,744
Whoa!

378
00:17:58,247 --> 00:17:59,780
Huh?

379
00:17:59,848 --> 00:18:01,482
Larry!

380
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,651
Man, everybody loves this guy.

381
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:05,718
Give him my number.

382
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:06,986
I'll teach him things.

383
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,921
Things he can use.

384
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:14,192
The older I get,

385
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,027
the more I like the taste of hot water.

386
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,231
* Here comes the prize *

387
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,933
* Pulitzer Prize *

388
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,303
* I'll finally be successful
in my mother's eyes. *

389
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:29,070
A little ler...

390
00:18:29,138 --> 00:18:30,271
little lower.

391
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:32,574
Drop that pillow!

392
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,044
It gets worse.

393
00:18:37,112 --> 00:18:38,645
Ow! Yeah.

394
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:42,415
See you tomorrow at yoga.

395
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:44,083
Jane is sick, so Tricia's filling in.

396
00:18:44,151 --> 00:18:46,518
As long as it's not a du!

397
00:18:55,728 --> 00:18:58,262
How can you stand up to this punishment?

398
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:00,896
I'm the toughest S.O.B. there is--

399
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:03,898
a biweekly human interest columnist.

400
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:06,733
And your father's gonna make me a fortune.

401
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:08,801
Pathetic old fool.

402
00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:11,603
Maybe so, but I know how to play possum.

403
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:12,771
Um...

404
00:19:20,145 --> 00:19:23,046
So many hat boxes.

405
00:19:25,183 --> 00:19:27,017
Dad, I don't have the right words

406
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:29,152
to say how I really feel about you,

407
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,586
but at least I know how
to beat up a guy who does.

408
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:35,689
Well, at least you never tried to kill me.

409
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,824
Just with indifference.

410
00:19:39,126 --> 00:19:40,460
You did good, kid.

411
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:42,562
This is for the shoeshine.

412
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,863
It's a ghost quarter,

413
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:45,531
but you'll be able to spend it pretty soon.

414
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:49,902
So, Grampa, you really saved Dad's life?

415
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,537
I sure did.

416
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:54,173
But why don't we let Homer tell the story?

417
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,574
Really? Me? u mean it?

418
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:59,510
I think you're ready for your first ramble.

419
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:02,112
Oh, I've been waiting for
this day for so long.

420
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:04,514
The year is 1946.

421
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:07,984
In a war-torn world, a single flower blooms.

422
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:11,687
And that flower is an angry
Japanese monster named Godzilla.

423
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:13,121
How am I doing, Dad?

424
00:20:13,189 --> 00:20:15,656
I'm hanging on every word.

425
00:20:15,723 --> 00:20:18,124
Fortunately, there was
one man who could help--

426
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:19,893
Colonel Tom Parker.

427
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:22,529
The Colonel took this monster,
cleaned him up

428
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,397
and put him onstage under the name

429
00:20:24,465 --> 00:20:26,232
The Rolling Stones.

430
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,933
The first concert was a sellout

431
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:30,602
with many, many, many people eaten.

432
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:34,539
But those that survived raved
about the undeniable harmonies

433
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:37,843
and brutally honest lyrics
of what they had just seen.

434
00:20:37,911 --> 00:20:41,346
<i>And that lasted for about five years.</i>

435
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:46,416
<i>But then, Godzilla dropped out for a while
to do movies,</i>

436
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:49,620
<i>all of the awful movies
we see now today</i>

437
00:20:49,687 --> 00:20:52,256
<i>in the driv
e-ins that no longer exist.</i>

Shh!
