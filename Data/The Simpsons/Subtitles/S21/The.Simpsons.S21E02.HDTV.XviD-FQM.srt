00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,050
(school bell ringing)

3
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,317
(belches)

4
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:23,317
(whistle blows)

5
00:00:23,384 --> 00:00:25,317
(yells)

6
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:30,884
(beeping)

7
00:00:36,117 --> 00:00:38,150
(playing the blues)

8
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:42,818
(playing the blues)

9
00:00:45,384 --> 00:00:46,983
D'oh!

10
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,083
(tires screeching)

11
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,684
(grunts)

13
00:01:04,017 --> 00:01:05,851
(alarm ringing)

14
00:01:05,918 --> 00:01:08,250
* Every day she takes
a morning bath *

15
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:10,484
* She wets her hair *

16
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:13,751
* Wraps a towel around her
as she's heading *

17
00:01:13,818 --> 00:01:15,350
* For the bedroom chair *

18
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:18,217
* It's just another day *

19
00:01:18,284 --> 00:01:21,083
* Slipping into stockings,
stepping into shoes *
(gargling)

20
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,918
This will be a good day.
This will be a good day.

21
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,950
This will be a good day.

22
00:01:26,017 --> 00:01:28,517
And five, and six... oh, yeah!

23
00:01:28,584 --> 00:01:30,950
* At the office
where the papers grow... *

24
00:01:31,017 --> 00:01:33,851
Your man is going to love
those sexy new abs.

25
00:01:33,918 --> 00:01:36,184
* Drinks another coffee
and she finds it hard *

26
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,684
* To stay awake *
(groans)

27
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:39,384
* It's just another day *

28
00:01:42,517 --> 00:01:43,851
* Do-do-do-do do-do-do *

29
00:01:43,918 --> 00:01:45,684
* It's just another day *

30
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:48,083
* Do-do-do-do do-do *

31
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,918
(singing along):

32
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:51,551
(laughs)
Check it out.

33
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:55,017
That crazy lady's singing
a million-year-old song.

34
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:00,751
(school bell ringing)

35
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:02,050
(sighs)

36
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:03,651
Okay, Edna, remember:

37
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:06,083
if you can teach one kid
one thing,

38
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,117
then today will be a success.

39
00:02:08,184 --> 00:02:11,350
(electronic beeps and blips)

40
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:13,484
Now, class...

41
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:15,117
class.

42
00:02:15,184 --> 00:02:17,517
Class, please pay attention!

43
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:19,751
Text "Uncle".
Text "Uncle".

44
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:26,751
(ring tones and electronic noise
grow louder)

45
00:02:36,684 --> 00:02:40,484
(cacophonous noise)

46
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:41,684
You're children.

47
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:43,818
Why do you all need cell phones?

48
00:02:43,884 --> 00:02:45,384
Safety.
Emergencies.

49
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:47,117
Safety.
Educational.

50
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:50,684
(sighs) Could you at least
set them to vibrate?

51
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:54,284
(loud vibrating)

52
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,017
(vibrating grows louder)

53
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,083
That's it:
everything in the box.

54
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:03,417
No more gizmos in this class.

55
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:06,517
They're all going in the drawer
with the biology frogs.

56
00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:08,117
(croaking)

57
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:11,884
(lock clicking)

58
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,350
(students groaning)

59
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:15,117
Okay. We'll call your bluff.

60
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:17,950
Teach us-- using only
the knowledge in your own head.

61
00:03:18,017 --> 00:03:19,818
Hey, don't worry.

62
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:22,384
We still have the good old
classroom computer.

63
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:24,950
<i>Who wants to play Word Jammers?</i>

64
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:31,484
(loudly booting up)

65
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:34,083
My stroked-out grandfather
has more memory than that thing.

66
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,484
How is he doing?

67
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:37,184
Better. Thanks.

68
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,651
(muttering angrily)

69
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:42,317
How could Krabappel
take my cell phone?

70
00:03:42,384 --> 00:03:45,818
I'm only on month one
of a 60-month plan.

71
00:03:45,884 --> 00:03:47,884
You know, Krabappel
just needs to chill out

72
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,117
and realize life is cool--
but how?

73
00:03:50,184 --> 00:03:52,017
(Homer giggling)

74
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,083
(drunkenly):
Okay. Now I'll be the dog,

75
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,217
and you be the daddy.

76
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:02,484
(barks)

77
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:05,651
(Santa's Little Helper barking)

78
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:09,551
Hmm. You know,

79
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:12,350
my dad is a lot more fun
after a few beers.

80
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:16,050
Maybe Mrs. K would be nicer
if we "Irish up" her coffee.

81
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:17,451
Put blood in it?

82
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:18,884
No, booze.

83
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,117
First the easy part.

84
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:22,083
Kids, get some liquor.

85
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,684
(Tchaikovsky's "Dance of the
Sugar Plum Fairy" plays)

86
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,717
Hurry! She's almost
done flirting

87
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:55,617
with the vending
machine guy.

88
00:04:55,684 --> 00:04:57,784
(laughing)

89
00:05:11,717 --> 00:05:13,684
What if she
tastes the booze?

90
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:15,217
Relax.

91
00:05:15,284 --> 00:05:16,950
Hazelnut creamer
covers all sins.

92
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,317
(slurping)

93
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,684
Ah.

94
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:22,918
<i>And that's why I found
Good Night, Gorilla</i>

95
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:25,050
to be the perfect
summer beach read.

96
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,651
Two stars for you.

97
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:29,317
And an extra,

98
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:33,083
'cause you're going
to have a hard life.

99
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,517
* This old man, he played one *

100
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:38,818
* He played knickknack
on my (hiccups) thumb. *

101
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:49,017
You look tired.

102
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,950
Maybe you need some more coffee.

103
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:55,451
Ah.

104
00:05:57,117 --> 00:06:01,117
(giggling drunkenly)

105
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:02,384
Dizzy.

106
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:04,717
(students giggling)

107
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,950
* You'll be going
back to Denmark *

108
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:13,250
* Spain and Uruguay *

109
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:16,250
* And we promise
that we'll write you *

110
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:18,517
* But you know
that that's a lie *

111
00:06:18,584 --> 00:06:21,918
Hey! You know why
they call it a choir.

112
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:25,884
Because "choir" we
listening to this crap?

113
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,350
(grunts) These pantyhose
are all twisted up.

114
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:31,083
Edna, please! Even the union
can't protect you from this.

115
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,818
Give me one
night, Dewey.

116
00:06:37,884 --> 00:06:39,818
I'll get you
off Broadway.

117
00:06:39,884 --> 00:06:41,684
Never!
Edna, let's go.

118
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,717
Uh-oh.

119
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:46,983
Do you think
we went too far?
Nah.

120
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,350
Booze only makes you do things
you already wanted to do.

121
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:53,017
I'm queen of the world!

122
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,250
Oh!
(crashing)

123
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:55,417
(Krabappel groans)

124
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:03,617
I'm so sorry.

125
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:05,284
I really don't know
what happened.

126
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,884
You made quite a nanny goat
of yourself yesterday.

127
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,684
I know I did,
but I don't know why.

128
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:12,884
(sighs) This is the hardest
thing I've ever had to do,

129
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,184
but I'm letting you go.

130
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:16,918
Seymour...

131
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:18,684
I'm going to cry.

132
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:22,784
Here. Take my hanky.

133
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:26,350
I'm working on my magic act
for the Faculty Follies.

134
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:30,083
But right now,
I don't feel much like follying.

135
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,451
Could I have a moment alone?

136
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:33,717
Of course.

137
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:40,184
There's a form to extend your
health insurance on my desk.

138
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:46,851
I never wanted
her to get fired.

139
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:49,684
I bet it was that hamster
medicine we added

140
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:51,217
that put her
over the edge.

141
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:54,083
Maybe I should tell Skinner
that it was our...

142
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,983
Needle scratch!

143
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,918
My name is Zachary Vaughn.

144
00:07:57,983 --> 00:08:00,584
I just got my masters
in education

145
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:03,584
from Tufts University,
and you are my first class ever.

146
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:05,517
An M.E.D. from Tufts?

147
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:06,851
Nice.

148
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:09,684
But why talk when I could text?

149
00:08:11,517 --> 00:08:13,117
Our cell phones!
Our Blueteeth!

150
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:14,751
My tip calculator!

151
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:19,417
(electronic tones sounding)

152
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,484
STUDENTS:
Whoa!

153
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:24,684
That text was totally worth

154
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:27,884
the 15 cents it cost
to receive it.

155
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,050
<i>BART:
Then, Zach Skyped us,</i>

156
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:30,451
live-blogged our
spelling bee

157
00:08:30,517 --> 00:08:32,217
and friended us
on Facebook.

158
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:35,184
I thought you were studying
the Lincoln-Douglas debates.

159
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,217
You mean the L Man/D Dog
flame wars.

160
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,117
(groans)

161
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:41,217
I'm glad you've got
such a stimulating substitute,

162
00:08:41,284 --> 00:08:43,284
but I'm worried
about Mrs. Krabappel.

163
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,050
Oh, no worries.

164
00:08:45,117 --> 00:08:47,484
I heard on the four-square
court she's doing great.

165
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:49,617
No one even plays
four-square anymore.

166
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:50,950
They just gossip.

167
00:08:53,684 --> 00:08:55,417
Ah...

168
00:08:57,184 --> 00:08:58,617
All right.

169
00:08:58,684 --> 00:09:01,317
Who can tell me
what the Monroe Doctrine was?

170
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:03,050
Oh, oh!

171
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:04,851
The policy of President Monroe
that America

172
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:07,184
has the right as a nation to...
Wait, wait, wait.

173
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,317
Are you telling me
you memorized that fact

174
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:12,417
when anyone with a cell phone
can find it out in 30 seconds?

175
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:14,050
I-I...

176
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:17,150
I've crammed my head
full of garbage!

177
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:18,918
Yes, you have.

178
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,150
What are these?

179
00:09:21,217 --> 00:09:22,784
Those are smiley stickers.

180
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:25,150
Mrs. Krabappel used to put them
on our papers

181
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:26,751
as a reward for good work.

182
00:09:26,818 --> 00:09:28,317
I run a paperless classroom.

183
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:29,784
Check this out.

184
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:34,284
But this is just
nonsense punctuation.

185
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,884
Oh, my God!

186
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,484
Anybody want to return
these caveman kudos

187
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:42,150
to Mrs. Krabappel?

188
00:09:42,217 --> 00:09:44,350
Uh, sure.
It's sort of on my way home.

189
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,284
I can check up on the old girl.

190
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,851
She probably landed a job at
some fancy-schmancy prep school.

191
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,250
Make way for the new freshman.

192
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:57,217
Where do I find the books,
the booze and the broads?

193
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:00,818
Hey, Dean, how about
a little privacy?

194
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:02,684
I've got to matriculate.

195
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:03,983
(laughs halfheartedly)

196
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,417
(doorbell rings)
Door's broken.

197
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:08,150
Mrs. K, is everything
all right?

198
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:09,684
Sure. (coughs)

199
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:11,417
Never better.

200
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:13,751
(hacking)

201
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:15,384
I know, Bart.

202
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:18,851
It's pretty sad to see
your teacher fallen so low.

203
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,751
(laughing)

204
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:23,484
It's the movie.
It's so funny.

205
00:10:26,217 --> 00:10:29,050
Sir, this is a benefit to
increase our endowment.

206
00:10:29,117 --> 00:10:31,184
Honey, if we increase
your endowment any more,

207
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,684
we'll all be in the shade.

208
00:10:32,751 --> 00:10:34,184
Hey, you're all right.

209
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,517
Hey, everyone,
dessert's on me.

210
00:10:37,584 --> 00:10:38,851
(chuckles)

211
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:40,451
(laughing)

212
00:10:41,452 --> 00:10:42,452
Sorry, sorry.

213
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,401
Thanks for bringing over
the smiley stickers, Bart.

214
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,801
They really liven
the place the up

215
00:10:53,868 --> 00:10:56,167
Mrs. K, you've got
to get out of here.

216
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:57,933
When was the last time
you washed your hair?

217
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,768
Hmm. Two weeks ago?

218
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:01,300
Well, that's better than me,

219
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,100
but still,
you've got to get out.

220
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:04,501
What's the point?

221
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,267
Out of work, I'm out of money.

222
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:07,900
No man wants me,
except Disco Stu.

223
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,933
Stu is about more
than just disco.

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,601
I'm also-- ha! --

225
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,634
super Christian!

226
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:18,701
Okay, look, there's a big
football game on tonight,

227
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:20,567
so we can get this thing
over real quick.

228
00:11:20,634 --> 00:11:23,167
Show me some of Bart's artwork,
give me a little false hope,

229
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:26,167
and here's a little something
to help with his grades.

230
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:28,868
I'm not asking for A's,
just incompletes.

231
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:30,933
Mr. Simpson, I don't
need your money.

232
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,834
Bart can definitely be
a challenge,

233
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,734
but, yeah, I like challenges,
and he...

234
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:36,401
(laughing):
...he's got a wild sense
of humor.

235
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:37,834
Look at this picture he drew.

236
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,167
(laughs)

237
00:11:39,234 --> 00:11:40,701
It will be his last birthday

238
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:42,401
if he keeps drawing pictures
like this.

239
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:44,334
What?
I said,
are there any areas

240
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:46,734
that we, his parents,
can improve upon?

241
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:49,667
Yes. Just one: relax.

242
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:51,467
You're clearly
a caring father.

243
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,100
(crying)

244
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:57,667
You're the first teacher
that ever got me.

245
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:59,200
(crying)

246
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:01,667
Let it out. Let it out.

247
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:04,701
(sobbing)

248
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:07,134
(loud sobbing)

249
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:11,701
(very loud sobbing)

250
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:15,467
Keep it in. Keep it in.

251
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:18,300
(very loud sobbing)

252
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:23,367
Two hot chocolates
with hot fudge boost.

253
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:24,734
Milhouse... (sighs)

254
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:26,367
...we ruined Edna's life.

255
00:12:26,434 --> 00:12:28,067
Maybe we can get her job back.

256
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:29,667
But we can't lose Zack.

257
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:32,601
Look at the awesome video
he just e-mailed me.

258
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:36,501
Check out the multiples
of seven, y'all.

259
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,900
* *

260
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:45,634
There's got to be
some other way to help Mrs. K.

261
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:47,768
Maybe we can find an
answer in this bookstore.

262
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,267
Bookstores don't have answers.

263
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:51,434
They just have creepy guys
sitting in easy chairs

264
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:53,200
at the end of aisle ways.

265
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:55,768
I ain't paid for Doris
Kearns Goodwin in my life,

266
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:57,801
and I ain't gonna start now.

267
00:12:57,868 --> 00:12:59,967
Oh, that's some good
Doris there.

268
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:01,501
You're right.

269
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,501
I guess no one's
ever written a book

270
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:05,801
to help a middle-aged
woman turn her life around.

271
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:10,134
<i>Excuse me. I believe you boys
are looking for... The Answer.</i>

272
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,801
<i>What's The Answer?</i>

273
00:13:11,868 --> 00:13:16,868
Only the best-selling book,
slash, DVD since the bible.

274
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:18,933
<i>WOMAN (with Australian accent):
My life was over.</i>

275
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,900
<i>I'd lost my job,
my husband left me.</i>

276
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,567
<i>I had to sleep
in a kangaroo's pouch.</i>

277
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:27,534
<i>And then I found...
The Answer.</i>

278
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:29,933
("O Fortuna" from Carmina Burana
plays)

279
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,634
<i>The Answer was discovered</i>

280
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:35,067
<i>by the philosophers
of ancient Greece, who hid it</i>

281
00:13:35,134 --> 00:13:37,601
<i>under a rock where it was
discovered by the knights</i>

282
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,434
<i>of King Arthur,
who placed it in a bottle</i>

283
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:41,534
<i>and set it in the ocean,</i>

284
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:43,967
<i>where it was found
by Pat Sajak.</i>

285
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,234
<i>These great men
knew The Answer.</i>

286
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:59,167
<i>The Answer is the secret to
achieving your heart's desire.</i>

287
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:01,933
<i>Learn The Answer,

288
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,567
<i>ANNOUNCER:
Available wherever dubious,</i>

289
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,834
<i>quasi-scientific
self-help books are sold.</i>

290
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:11,100
So, um, you're wearing
the same bathrobe

291
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:13,000
you were the last
time I was here, huh?

292
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:14,467
That's cool.

293
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:16,100
Bart, you're a good kid.

294
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:17,667
You're the only one
who came to see me.

295
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:19,467
Well, Mrs. K,

296
00:14:19,534 --> 00:14:22,067
<i>I have just the book, slash, DVD
for you-- The Answer.</i>

297
00:14:22,134 --> 00:14:24,534
"This book uses
the ancient power of wanting."

298
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:26,401
That makes absolutely no sense.

299
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:28,967
Hey. "Just because
we don't understand electricity,

300
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:31,334
doesn't mean we can't enjoy
its benefits."

301
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:33,167
But we do
understand electricity.

302
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:35,701
Every positively charged
nucleus is...

303
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:37,667
Cut it out.
You're not a teacher anymore.

304
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:39,234
Way to cheer me up, kid.

305
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,634
(coughing)

306
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:42,768
Look, Mrs. K, I'm a Simpson,

307
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:44,334
and a Simpson
never gives up

308
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:46,367
until he's tried at
least one easy thing.

309
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:47,868
Let me help you.

310
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:49,501
Aw.

311
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,801
So, did you write
your dream on the...

312
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:55,401
"index card of fate"?

313
00:14:55,467 --> 00:14:57,768
Yes, but it still seems...

314
00:14:57,834 --> 00:15:01,100
<i>stupid.</i>

315
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,734
reading:

316
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:05,267
Great idea!

317
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:06,868
Now, let's see.

318
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:09,200
"Break your dream down
into smaller wishes,

319
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:12,000
then break those down
into wish-able actions."

320
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:13,967
Bart, this is starting to sound

321
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:16,134
like one of those loony
self-help books.

322
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,100
Loony? Would a loony self-help
book come with a magic

323
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,900
question mark inside?

324
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,367
Huh? Huh? Huh?

325
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,768
<i>All thanks to The Answer!</i>

326
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:29,567
Well, opening this store
was a lot of work,

327
00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:31,267
but your faith in me
got me through it.

328
00:15:31,334 --> 00:15:33,033
And it looks like

329
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,534
you got your own
index card of fate.

330
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,200
What's your dream?
Nothing, nothing.

331
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:39,534
Well, I'm sure
it'll come true.

332
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:47,768
(humming)

333
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:49,768
One cran-bran
for the Flan-man.

334
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:51,501
My pleasure.

335
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:52,900
What did he want?

336
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:54,401
Beats me.

337
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:56,100
I just gave him a banana.

338
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,900
Well, thanks again, Bart.

339
00:15:57,967 --> 00:16:00,601
This store has definitely
turned my life around.

340
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,768
Yup. I'm off the hook now.

341
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:04,234
What do you mean by that?

342
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,134
Well, I guess I can tell you,

343
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,933
'cause everything worked out
for the best.

344
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,601
Everything? What everything?

345
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,000
(laughs)

346
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:14,634
Well, it's funny, really.

347
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:16,701
I'm the one
who put booze in your coffee

348
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,567
and got you fired.

349
00:16:18,634 --> 00:16:19,900
(laughs)

350
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,567
You did what?!

351
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:23,868
Please don't kill me.

352
00:16:26,034 --> 00:16:28,034
You ruined my life!

353
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:30,600
It's your fault I have to work
at this stupid muffin store.

354
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:32,134
But this place
was your dream!

355
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,168
My real dream was
to be a teacher,

356
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:36,233
and you got me fired!

357
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,400
Now I'm up to my eyeballs
in debt with this stupid store,

358
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:42,600
and four more muffin stores
just opened on this block!

359
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:52,101
No!

360
00:16:52,168 --> 00:16:54,667
<i>But-But-But you found
The Answer!</i>

361
00:16:56,068 --> 00:16:58,834
No! I wrote a phone number
in there!

362
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:01,801
No matter what you've done,
I always thought

363
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:04,168
there was a spark of decency
in you, Bart Simpson,

364
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,634
but I was wrong.

365
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:08,034
I never thought
I'd say this to a child,

366
00:17:08,101 --> 00:17:11,734
but you are bad
on the inside.

367
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:12,934
(gasps)

368
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:15,767
(humming)

369
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,767
Dad, am I bad on the inside?

370
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:22,034
No... but the layers of bad
on your surface

371
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:23,701
go almost all the way
to the center.

372
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:27,200
But you think there's, like, a
kernel of good inside me, right?

373
00:17:27,267 --> 00:17:28,701
Hmm. I don't know.

374
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:30,467
Kernels are kind of big.

375
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:32,934
Oh! Listen, I was thinking.

376
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:38,001
If someone did a really
bad thing to one teacher,

377
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:40,567
and then did the same bad
thing to another teacher

378
00:17:40,634 --> 00:17:43,834
to get the first teacher her
job back, would it be okay?

379
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:46,434
When you sayteacher,
do you really meanparent?

380
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,267
No, I mean teacher.

381
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,834
Great. Go nuts.

382
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:52,168
But remember, we never
had this discussion.

383
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:53,634
What discussion?

384
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:55,168
The one we just had

385
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:57,600
about you doing bad things,
you stupid kid!

386
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:00,300
Oh.

387
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:27,134
So, you see,
it was my fault.

388
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,701
I got Mrs. Krabappel drunk.

389
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,767
Then I was gonna do
the same thing to Zack,

390
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:33,101
but I decided it was better
to just tell the truth.

391
00:18:33,168 --> 00:18:37,001
Bart, you deserve a reward
for telling the truth.

392
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:39,901
And that reward will be in
the form of a severe punishment.

393
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:42,734
Doesn't matter, as long
as Edna gets her job back.

394
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:45,300
Sorry, Bart, but I can't just
get rid of a teacher

395
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:46,767
if he's doing a good job.

396
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,367
Or an adequate job.

397
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:50,434
Or just shows up
and doesn't touch anyone.

398
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,400
ZACK (chanting):
I hate children!

399
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:54,233
I hate children!

400
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,200
Children suck!
Children suck!

401
00:18:57,267 --> 00:19:01,834
What the...? Faculty lounge talk
out in the halls?!

402
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:05,168
I hate children!
I hate children!

403
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,600
You and you and you
and you and you!

404
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:09,634
(slurring his speech):
You are wasting your lives.

405
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:11,600
Hilary Swank didn't graduate
high school.

406
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,233
She won two Oscars.

407
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,400
And one of them she deserved.

408
00:19:16,467 --> 00:19:18,068
<i>Bart, you said you
didn't get him drunk.</i>

409
00:19:18,134 --> 00:19:19,834
I didn't. I swear!

410
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:21,434
No, he's right.

411
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,134
I mixed a little vodka
in with my Blue Bronco.

412
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Does anybody else want
to ride the indigo pony!

413
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,967
Is there extra credit in it?

414
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:33,168
Oh, they're gonna eat you alive
at Cal Tech, boy.

415
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:35,134
Alive!

416
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,567
(laughs)
Oh!

417
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,300
Oh, yeah!

418
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,168
* This place is a prison! *

419
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:41,767
* Dow, dow *

420
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:43,600
* All you kids are screwed! *

421
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:45,168
* Dow, dow *

422
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:46,767
* Kids and vodka! *

423
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:48,300
Yeow!

424
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:50,567
(laughing)

425
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:53,168
It's always the good ones
that go crazy the fastest.

426
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:55,034
Get off me!

427
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:57,801
You can get rid of me, but you
can't get rid of the truth, man!

428
00:19:57,867 --> 00:20:00,034
This school is
a glorified hamster wheel

429
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:02,168
run by incompetent bureaucrats

430
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,901
who can get you
through a test,

431
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,867
but you will fail
the test of life!

432
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:08,467
Children, fingers in your ears
and make the la-la sound.

433
00:20:08,534 --> 00:20:10,901
* La-la, la-la,
la-la, la-la... *
Every class is a joke.

434
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:12,767
English-- a joke,
homeroom-- a joke.

435
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:14,634
Free period-- a joke.

436
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:16,467
Nutritious
lunch-- a joke!

437
00:20:16,534 --> 00:20:18,567
Only alcohol can
make life bearable.

438
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,101
You must drink!
Always drink!

439
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,434
Well, class, I've got
to say I'm glad to be back.

440
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,834
And there's no
hard feelings?
Nope.

441
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:32,400
Now, everyone enjoy one
of my yummy muffins.

442
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:36,734
But it's stale.
Eat the muffin.

443
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,934
<i>WOMAN:
