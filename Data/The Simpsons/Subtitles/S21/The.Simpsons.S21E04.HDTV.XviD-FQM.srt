1
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:15,994
Oh, for the
love of...

2
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:17,881
Huh?

3
00:00:20,877 --> 00:00:22,404
Ah, Halloween:

4
00:00:22,477 --> 00:00:25,689
the one night when we can walk
the streets undetected.

5
00:00:26,908 --> 00:00:28,094
Hey, lame-os.

6
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:30,199
Turner Classic
Movies called.

7
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:32,377
They want
their costumes back.

8
00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:37,080
We lame-os?

9
00:00:37,142 --> 00:00:38,925
I have a remedy
for our predicament.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,481
Into this costumery.

11
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:47,135
Yeah?
Oh.

12
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:57,906
Friends of Homer's?

13
00:00:58,007 --> 00:00:59,217
They're not my friends.

14
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:00,990
We brought a bottle of booze.

15
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:02,991
Boooooze!

16
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:04,673
Come in! Come in!

17
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,188
Mmm.

18
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:15,447
Good!

19
00:01:15,516 --> 00:01:17,256
Beer good.

20
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,433
You good.

21
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:32,406
You said you were going out
to kill children tonight.

22
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:33,485
We were,

23
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:36,259
then we bumped into our old friend,
the-the-the--

24
00:01:36,308 --> 00:01:37,654
my man here!

25
00:01:37,718 --> 00:01:39,712
You'll be sucking
your own blood tonight.

26
00:01:39,788 --> 00:01:40,992
Let's get 'em, girls!

27
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:45,149
Bad Wolf!

28
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:46,208
Bad!

29
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:47,727
Lighten up, ladies.

30
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:50,001
It's not cheating
when you're wearing a costume!

31
00:01:50,086 --> 00:01:51,645
Not the face!

32
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:12,692
It's time to announce my choice
to represent our class

33
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:14,780
at the National Reading Roundup.

34
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:16,710
<i>Here it comes.</i>

35
00:02:16,782 --> 00:02:19,519
My choice is...
Hubert Wong!

36
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,615
Wha...?

37
00:02:20,727 --> 00:02:22,367
Hooray for Different-Face!

38
00:02:22,437 --> 00:02:24,386
Congratulations,
Hubert.

39
00:02:24,497 --> 00:02:26,556
Or should I congratulate
your tutor:

40
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:28,874
Amelia,
at the Homework Factory!

41
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:30,582
Your victory is tainted!

42
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:32,831
Asterisk! Asterisk!
Lisa,

43
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,112
don't take it personally.

44
00:02:34,177 --> 00:02:36,531
I barely spent any time
on this decision.

45
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,189
Asterisk! Asterisk!

46
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:39,287
Asterisk!

47
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,574
Lisa Simpson
in detention?!

48
00:02:44,656 --> 00:02:47,332
My horoscope told me I'd see
something interesting today,

49
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:49,278
but I thought that meant
the horoscope itself!

50
00:02:49,397 --> 00:02:51,515
Stupid Miss Hoover.

51
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:56,093
I heard about your run-in
with Hoover.

52
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,428
Aren't teachers
the worst?

53
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:58,747
I don't want to
talk about it.

54
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,737
Listen, you're
a smart kid.

55
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:02,295
I bet you like ideas.

56
00:03:02,408 --> 00:03:03,429
I do.

57
00:03:03,523 --> 00:03:05,985
Well, I just had a whopper!

58
00:03:06,057 --> 00:03:08,608
What if you got revenge
on Krabappel for me,

59
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:11,354
and I got revenge
on Hoover for you?

60
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:12,573
Crisscross!

61
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,600
Interesting.

62
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:16,706
With no obvious motive,
no one would suspect us.

63
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:18,470
Exactly! Crisscross!

64
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:19,926
Do we have a deal?
Thanks,

65
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:21,009
but I'll pass.

66
00:03:21,123 --> 00:03:22,373
If I say "crisscross"
one more time,

67
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,515
will that change your mind?
Listen,

68
00:03:23,624 --> 00:03:24,976
you're a persistent
fellow, but I...

69
00:03:25,026 --> 00:03:26,169
Crisscross!
I'm in.

70
00:03:42,747 --> 00:03:44,757
Bart, have you established
your alibi?

71
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,165
Yep. I'm at the tennis match.

72
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:47,811
And people will remember
you were there?

73
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:49,752
I'm pretty sure they will.

74
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:51,154
Mm-hmm.

75
00:03:51,214 --> 00:03:52,947
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

76
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,969
Hello?

77
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:01,523
Hello? Oh!

78
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:03,400
I've been ding-dong-ditched!

79
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:05,984
Crisscross.

80
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:12,836
You should've seen the look
on Krabappel's face!

81
00:04:12,896 --> 00:04:15,034
And you should've seen
the look on Hoover's face.

82
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:16,059
In fact,

83
00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:16,930
here it is.

84
00:04:18,713 --> 00:04:20,100
You killed her?

85
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:21,564
Right. Like we agreed.

86
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:22,926
I never said "kill"!

87
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:24,301
Yeah, 'cause you're smart.

88
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,472
You don't say "kill,"
you say "prank."

89
00:04:26,523 --> 00:04:28,087
Like Mom and Dad
say "snuggle"

90
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:29,182
when what they
really mean is

91
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:30,914
"let's lock the
door and hug."

92
00:04:30,957 --> 00:04:33,377
Well, I didn't kill
Mrs. Krabappel!

93
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,594
So, all you did was ring
her doorbell and run?

94
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,604
Yeah, ding-dong-ditch!

95
00:04:37,673 --> 00:04:39,973
"Ding-dong-ditch"
means you kill her,

96
00:04:40,036 --> 00:04:42,191
then you throw that ding-dong
into a ditch.

97
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:44,568
Geez, pick up a book.

98
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:45,739
You're a monster!

99
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:47,636
A deal's a deal,
little sister.

100
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:50,166
Tomorrow after school,
go to her house and t.p. her.

101
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:51,811
That's it?
Just t.p. her?

102
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:53,474
Yeah, torture and pulverize her.

103
00:04:53,515 --> 00:04:55,461
Then ding-dong-ditch the body
and we're even.

104
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:56,985
I think I'm gonna
be sick.

105
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:09,666
Oh, Lisa!

106
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:12,314
Come hold this blade so it
doesn't slice through my neck.

107
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:15,617
Come on.

108
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:16,944
I trust you completely.

109
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:25,878
Slice her like a bagel!

110
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,244
Ah, got it!

111
00:05:27,356 --> 00:05:28,146
Thanks, Lisa.

112
00:05:28,207 --> 00:05:29,753
Last thing I want is
to be sliced in two--

113
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:31,261
you know, like a bagel.

114
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:41,441
Bart?

115
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,695
I've been waiting
for you...

116
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:45,093
and trying to figure out
how girls pee.

117
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,022
Sorry, Bart, I couldn't do it!

118
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:50,405
There's got to be another way.

119
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:52,476
What if I gave you
homework help?

120
00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:53,660
I won't give you
the answers,

121
00:05:53,717 --> 00:05:56,064
but I'll give you the tools
to find the answers yourself.

122
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:57,354
No dice.

123
00:05:57,428 --> 00:05:58,893
Either take care of Krabappel,

124
00:05:58,924 --> 00:06:01,936
or Groundskeeper Willie will say
he saw you kill Miss Hoover.

125
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,254
Why would Willie do that?

126
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,490
Let's just say...

127
00:06:04,571 --> 00:06:06,096
he owes me a favor.

128
00:06:08,464 --> 00:06:09,490
Crisscross!

129
00:06:09,564 --> 00:06:11,338
Like the plaid
on me kilt!

130
00:06:11,395 --> 00:06:12,572
You're not wearing
a kilt.

131
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:13,327
Uh-oh.

132
00:06:14,152 --> 00:06:14,932
All right, Bart.

133
00:06:15,003 --> 00:06:16,344
I guess I have
no choice.

134
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:17,833
I have to kill...

135
00:06:18,397 --> 00:06:19,153
you!

136
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:10,797
Go ahead, do it.

137
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,984
You're no different from me.

138
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,607
We're made from the same dinna.

139
00:07:13,636 --> 00:07:15,796
It's pronounced D-N-A,
you idiot.

140
00:07:15,865 --> 00:07:17,321
And we are not the same.

141
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:19,805
I am not a murderer,
and I never will be!

142
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:26,687
Well done, Lisa!

143
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:28,786
It was an accident,
I swear!

144
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:30,786
Sure. An accident.

145
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:31,785
Ha!

146
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:34,551
<i>Ay carumba, you
little snot.</i>

147
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:44,865
I'm here at Krustyburger
for the launch

148
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:46,864
of the highly anticipated
"Burger Squared."

149
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,354
Krusty, what
can you tell us

150
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,523
about this fantastic
new sandwich?

151
00:07:50,562 --> 00:07:52,250
I'm glad you
asked, Kent.

152
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:53,076
We start

153
00:07:53,148 --> 00:07:55,593
with Grade A beef,
feed that to other cows,

154
00:07:55,652 --> 00:07:58,542
then kill them
and serve the unholy results

155
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:00,324
on a seven-grain bun.

156
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:01,902
Burger Squared!

157
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,064
The math checks out!

158
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,531
Cows eating cows?!

159
00:08:05,704 --> 00:08:07,259
That's an abomination!

160
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,488
Now, Lisa,

161
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:09,776
you're a vegetarian,

162
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,051
but these cows have made
a different choice.

163
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:14,829
And now, this lucky reporter
will be the first human

164
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:18,088
to sample this delicious crime
against nature.

165
00:08:18,154 --> 00:08:19,381
Mmm.

166
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:20,619
Juicy, flavorful,

167
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:22,356
with just a hint of...

168
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:26,928
Hey!

169
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:28,641
That's my check-cashing
arm, you stupid...

170
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,603
you might want
to wash me before you eat me.

171
00:08:46,663 --> 00:08:48,656
Thank you.

172
00:08:49,622 --> 00:08:51,178
The munchers got Moe!

173
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:52,852
Well, we're not going
out to help him.

174
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,974
We have no idea what hideous
creatures might be out there!

175
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:57,799
Please, let me in!

176
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:00,251
How do I know
you're not a muncher?

177
00:09:00,305 --> 00:09:02,984
I'm your father
and I need your help!

178
00:09:03,071 --> 00:09:05,313
I can't make sense
of that muncher talk!

179
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,243
Hungry.

180
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,815
So hungry.

181
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:14,228
There's nothing to eat.

182
00:09:14,285 --> 00:09:16,221
Except this.

183
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,101
There's gotta be something yummy
out there.

184
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:29,665
A hamburger!

185
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:41,038
Bart ate
a tainted burger!

186
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,719
I'll bash him
with this book!

187
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,485
Dad!

188
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:47,350
No! That's the last book
in the world!

189
00:09:47,464 --> 00:09:48,598
Really?

190
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:50,094
Yes! It's-- oh.

191
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,252
Go ahead.

192
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:53,308
Wait!

193
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:55,111
The burger didn't change me!

194
00:09:55,232 --> 00:09:56,763
I'm not a muncher!

195
00:09:56,856 --> 00:09:58,257
Oh, my God.

196
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:00,641
If Bart could eat the burger
and survive,

197
00:10:00,711 --> 00:10:04,625
then maybe he can yield the key
to an anti-muncher vaccine!

198
00:10:06,437 --> 00:10:08,827
Then we must keep this boy
safe from harm!

199
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,697
Better call Dr. Hibbert.

200
00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:16,587
Well, I suppose
Bart could be immune--

201
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:18,639
a genetic "chosen one,"
if you will.

202
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,374
If so, secrets locked

203
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:24,168
within his blood could
be the key to saving humanity.

204
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,777
You must get him immediately

205
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,602
to the safe zone,
just outside of town.

206
00:10:27,638 --> 00:10:30,698
If you see my wife,
tell her I love her.

207
00:10:30,784 --> 00:10:32,589
You mean tell her
I love her?

208
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,834
Or I meaning you?

209
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,649
Mm, I'll just
high-five her.

210
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:46,049
Now remember, no loud noises.

211
00:10:48,754 --> 00:10:51,238
Oh, man, that
breeze feels good!

212
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:57,797
To the panic room!

213
00:10:57,902 --> 00:10:59,370
We don't have
a panic room!

214
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:00,949
To the panic room store!

215
00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:09,764
Come with me
if you want to live.

216
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:15,155
Another politician
who can't keep his promises.

217
00:11:15,473 --> 00:11:16,325
Psst!

218
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:17,223
This way.

219
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:20,320
Well, this day can't
get any crazier.

220
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:35,982
Apu, how did you survive?

221
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:37,492
Well, as a vegetarian,

222
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,745
I did not consume
any tainted burgers,

223
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:42,757
and as a convenience store
owner, I am armed to the teeth.

224
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:48,292
We need windows, too!

225
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,848
Shoot her!

226
00:11:58,419 --> 00:11:59,713
I can't shoot her.

227
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:01,153
She's Lisa's godmother.

228
00:12:01,228 --> 00:12:02,617
You can apologize in hell!

229
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:03,738
I guess I could.

230
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:19,310
Hmm?

231
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:20,278
What the...?

232
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:22,098
I will get
out and push.

233
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:25,235
No matter what, Bart must
make it to the safe zone.

234
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:35,970
That was so noble of Apu
to give his life for us.

235
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:37,207
Where are you going?!

236
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:39,579
You were supposed to stop
at the bottom and wait for me!

237
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:55,633
I don't see the
safe zone anywhere.

238
00:12:55,723 --> 00:12:56,918
Let's play a game.

239
00:12:57,029 --> 00:12:59,110
Who gets to carry
the chosen one?

240
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:00,703
Ow!

241
00:13:00,782 --> 00:13:04,542
Aw, did the chosen one hurt
his chosen little noggin?

242
00:13:04,613 --> 00:13:06,987
<i>Ow! Ow! Ow!</i>

243
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:09,363
Ow! Quit it. Ow!

244
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:10,434
Quit it!

245
00:13:11,304 --> 00:13:12,302
Well, well, well.

246
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:15,513
Who's an unproductive
worker now?

247
00:13:16,349 --> 00:13:17,750
Got your nose.

248
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:20,577
Why you...

249
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:30,605
Homie, where
have you been?

250
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:35,105
Dad, are you becoming a muncher?

251
00:13:35,183 --> 00:13:38,645
I think the better brains is,
are you brains a brains?

252
00:13:40,657 --> 00:13:42,063
Where do you want it,
the mouth or the eyes?

253
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:43,802
Ooh, mouth.
Eyes it is.

254
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,180
No! When we get you
to the safe zone,

255
00:13:46,272 --> 00:13:47,923
we can cure your father!

256
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:49,125
Safe zone?

257
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:51,038
You really think
there's a safe zone?

258
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:53,914
Well, you're right.
It's right over there.

259
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:57,192
Let us in.

260
00:13:57,366 --> 00:14:00,072
We have the chosen one!

261
00:14:00,124 --> 00:14:02,580
Oh...!

262
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:03,537
Welcome, son.

263
00:14:03,587 --> 00:14:06,586
To survive, all we must
do is eat your flesh.

264
00:14:06,684 --> 00:14:08,278
Hold it right there, bub.

265
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:11,203
What kind of civilized people
eat the body

266
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:13,532
and blood of their savior?

267
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:16,852
There must be another way.

268
00:14:18,494 --> 00:14:20,141
Hmm...

269
00:14:22,142 --> 00:14:23,354
<i>Time has passed.</i>

270
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,108
<i>Children play in the streets.</i>

271
00:14:25,185 --> 00:14:27,613
<i>At night,
there is music and laughter.</i>

272
00:14:27,681 --> 00:14:31,140
<i>And all we had to do was let
Bart take a bath in our food.</i>

273
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:33,275
Hey, Lis,
want some soup?

274
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:39,426
Mm-hmm.

275
00:14:49,191 --> 00:14:54,013
* Oh, why can't no girl love
a guy with this mug *

276
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:59,172
* Whose mother declared
you're too ugly to hug? *

277
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:08,287
How's about pouring
me a beer, ugly?

278
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:10,376
How about some
of my new microbrew?

279
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:12,925
Must be another mouse
in the pipe.

280
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,919
Let's see
if this cobra solves it.

281
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,206
Nothing.

282
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:20,125
Huh.

283
00:15:20,232 --> 00:15:25,317
* Just once I wish cupid
would draw back his bow *

284
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,989
* And shoot me a cutie
whose standards are low... *

285
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,726
An unattended tap!

286
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:34,480
Like taking beer
from a baby!

287
00:15:34,577 --> 00:15:39,022
* I'm unlucky in love,
I'm unlucky in luck... *

288
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:42,808
Oh, my God, Homer!

289
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:43,693
Just try to relax.

290
00:15:44,462 --> 00:15:46,084
Okay, don't relax!
Don't relax!

291
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:48,861
Oh, Marge, the most
awful thing just happened!

292
00:15:48,923 --> 00:15:50,133
What is it, Moe?

293
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:51,507
Um...

294
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:55,983
She's so beautiful,
it makes my heart take wing!

295
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:57,151
Look at me!

296
00:15:57,228 --> 00:15:59,575
I can fl... Ow! Ow! Aah!

297
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:07,975
Um, Marge, Homer,
uh, just ran out

298
00:16:08,038 --> 00:16:10,265
saying he don't love you,
and he never did.

299
00:16:10,362 --> 00:16:11,336
He what?!

300
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:13,987
Help me!

301
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,246
That, uh... that's me.

302
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,176
I've been taking
ventriloquism lessons.

303
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:20,405
Help me or kill me!

304
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,798
Huh? Huh!

305
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:24,959
Now, let Dr. Moe cure
what ails you.

306
00:16:36,738 --> 00:16:38,811
There's something odd
about this beer.

307
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:41,171
* It tastes
like cuddling *

308
00:16:42,226 --> 00:16:44,270
* It tastes like clean clothes *

309
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:49,426
* It tastes like hot steaming
cocoa mixed with rainbows... *

310
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,075
It does?
* Full-bodied *

311
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:52,533
* Full-blooded *

312
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,916
* It's such a lovely blend *

313
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:59,967
* It's jolly, it's loyal, like
drinking your best friend! *

314
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,418
* I stopped my crying *

315
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:05,206
* Why, I don't know *

316
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:11,378
* But this rosy, cozy,
bubbles-in-my-nose-y *

317
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:16,763
* Makes me wanna have... Mo'! *

318
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:24,683
This is the best
musical in light years.

319
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:27,711
Light years measure
distance, not time.

320
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:29,276
You know
what I meant.

321
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:37,817
So, Marge, uh, Homer's been gone
a whole week, huh?

322
00:17:47,492 --> 00:17:49,323
Marge, I've got some
bad news to give you.

323
00:17:49,389 --> 00:17:51,520
It's a letter from Homer
on my stationery

324
00:17:51,606 --> 00:17:53,030
in my handwriting,

325
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:55,117
using my idioms
and speech patterns.

326
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,017
And it begins, "Dear Midge:

327
00:17:57,068 --> 00:17:58,662
"you probably hate me by now,

328
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,699
"and if you don't,
what's wrong which youse?

329
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:02,044
"But don't give up on men.

330
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:04,368
Bart, Linda and the other one
there need a dad."

331
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:06,846
That does sound like Homer.

332
00:18:06,906 --> 00:18:08,530
"The reason
I left you is simple."

333
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:10,745
"I'm gay."?!

334
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:12,273
Yeah, read on. It gets gayer.

335
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,675
* While turning gay
the other day *

336
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:16,891
* A thought occurred to me *

337
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:22,791
* I'd like to try most every guy
from here to Timbuk-tee *

338
00:18:24,341 --> 00:18:26,651
* Oh, there's so many men
around the world *

339
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:28,095
* Of every shape and size *

340
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:31,804
* I want to nibble on Jamaican
jerks and teriyaki thighs *

341
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:33,854
* I want
to French-kiss a Frenchman *

342
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,684
* And spoon an English duke *

343
00:18:35,754 --> 00:18:36,954
* 'Cause frankly, dear *

344
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:39,150
* To not be queer
just makes me want to puke *

345
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:43,033
* So find yourself a man
who'll want you in the sack *

346
00:18:43,097 --> 00:18:45,119
* I recommend
our dear old friend *

347
00:18:46,176 --> 00:18:50,018
* Bartender Moe Szyslak! *

348
00:18:51,904 --> 00:18:54,986
* Letters don't lie! *

349
00:18:55,778 --> 00:18:57,007
So, what do think, Marge?

350
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,562
Will you give Moe a throw?

351
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:00,295
Hmm, well...

352
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:02,790
Maybe you need a little more
milk of amnesia.

353
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:05,436
Dang, I'm missing
the secret ingredient.

354
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,800
Uh, let me squeeze some more out
of the secret ingredient bag.

355
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:10,792
Uh-oh.

356
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,512
Looks like I got to wing it
a little bit here.

357
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,279
The other day,
I ran into an Irishman.

358
00:19:15,336 --> 00:19:16,438
Oh, really?

359
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:17,596
No, O'Reilly.

360
00:19:19,135 --> 00:19:20,755
Oh, uh, I see we're,
uh, back in business.

361
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:24,736
Now, a little more hemoglobin,
and your wife will be disrobin'.

362
00:19:28,415 --> 00:19:29,722
I can't talk now.

363
00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:30,870
I'm watching a play.

364
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,939
You want how much
for a radiator?

365
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:35,733
Is that new or rebuilt?

366
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,876
There.

367
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:44,562
Oh. Oh. Oh, my God,
I've never felt so...

368
00:19:44,674 --> 00:19:47,438
uncreeped-out by you!

369
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:49,001
Marge, I loves youse.

370
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,453
Will youse be mines?

371
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:53,097
I guess it is time to move on.

372
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:01,493
Before you do, I just
got to warn you, Marge.

373
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:04,468
* My taste for romance
is kinda perverse *

374
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:07,913
* I can only make love
in the back of a hearse *

375
00:20:08,026 --> 00:20:11,113
* Plus I gotta be dressed
as a Civil War nurse *

376
00:20:11,203 --> 00:20:14,157
* And then when I'm finished,
I'll go through your purse *

377
00:20:14,249 --> 00:20:15,675
* But you could do worse *

378
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,398
* I could do worse *

379
00:20:18,502 --> 00:20:19,781
* We're proof that you *

380
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:22,146
- * You could do worse *
- * I could do worse *

381
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:25,940
* She couldn't possibly
do worse! *

382
00:20:30,474 --> 00:20:34,282
Homer, does this mean
you still love me?

383
00:20:34,405 --> 00:20:35,811
Of course I do, Marge.

384
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:39,043
Can you still love a man
who's half-beer?

385
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:40,971
I always have.

386
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,550
To love!

387
00:20:48,977 --> 00:20:52,755
<i>* We hope you enjoyed
this year's Halloween show *</i>

388
00:20:53,505 --> 00:20:55,822
* Treehouse of Horror,
number XX! *

389
00:20:57,026 --> 00:20:57,716
Shh!
