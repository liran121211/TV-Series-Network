00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:36,219
Dad, how can you call
it a ski weekend

3
00:01:36,287 --> 00:01:38,188
if we're going home
at dawn on Sunday?

4
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:39,956
Got to leave early
to beat the traffic.

5
00:01:40,024 --> 00:01:42,325
Now, to get
on Route 205,

6
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,194
and it's a straight
shot home.

7
00:01:45,763 --> 00:01:48,164
Oh, for crying out...!

8
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:53,303
I hate traffic--
the band and the phenomenon.

9
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,704
Well, there's only one game

10
00:01:54,772 --> 00:01:56,739
we can play in the car
over and over

11
00:01:56,807 --> 00:01:58,975
and over again: bonk it.

12
00:01:59,043 --> 00:02:00,610
Oh, I'm sorry, kids.

13
00:02:00,678 --> 00:02:02,979
We lost the batteries for that.

14
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:07,283
No problem. A couple
just rolled out

15
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:09,252
from behind
your seat.

16
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,687
Bonk it. Twist it.

17
00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:11,988
Smack it. Thwack it.

18
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:14,090
Whack it. Bonk it. Bop it.

19
00:02:14,158 --> 00:02:16,192
Thwack it. Twist it. Bop it.

20
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,327
Smack it. Whack it.

21
00:02:17,394 --> 00:02:18,461
Thwack it. Bonk it.

22
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:20,029
Twist it. Smack it.

23
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:21,464
Bonk it. Twist it. Smack it.

24
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:24,334
Thwack it. Whack it. Bonk it.
Twist it. Smack it.

25
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:25,768
Thwack it. Whack it. Bonk it.

26
00:02:25,836 --> 00:02:27,270
Twist it. Smack it.

27
00:02:27,338 --> 00:02:28,771
Thwack it. Whack it. Bonk it.

28
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,974
I can't take it anymore!

29
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,876
Whack it. Thwack...

30
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:34,510
Bonk it. Twist it.

31
00:02:34,578 --> 00:02:36,579
I can't take
it anymore!

32
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,583
Bonk it. Twist it. Smack it.

33
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:42,619
Bonk it. Whack it. Twist it.
D'oh!

34
00:02:42,686 --> 00:02:44,053
Twist it.

35
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:45,855
Smack it.

36
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:47,323
Oh, darn.

37
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:49,025
The batteries
are dead.

38
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:50,560
Not to worry--
it plugs

39
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,895
into the cigarette lighter.

40
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:53,529
Bonk-bonk-bonk it.
Twist it. Smack it. Thwack it.

41
00:02:53,597 --> 00:02:54,831
Whack it. Bonk it. Bop it.

42
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:55,865
Hey, kids, it's
daddy's turn.

43
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,133
Bonk it. Bop it. Twist it.

44
00:02:57,201 --> 00:02:58,534
Smack it. Thwack it. Whack it.

45
00:02:58,602 --> 00:02:59,535
Stomp it!

46
00:02:59,603 --> 00:03:00,603
Crush it! Kill it!

47
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:01,738
Bonk it.

48
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:04,107
Bonk... It.

49
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:06,643
Finally, some
peace and quiet.

50
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:12,982
Oh, why do my actions
have consequences?

51
00:03:34,138 --> 00:03:36,873
Now, kids, we're about
to get really cold,

52
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:39,943
then really warm.

53
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,954
Bonk it. Twist it. Smack it.

54
00:03:58,162 --> 00:03:59,529
Drink up, sweetie.

55
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:01,631
Let the possum work its magic.

56
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,700
Possum?!

57
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:05,034
Oh, don't worry,
we don't kill it.

58
00:04:05,102 --> 00:04:06,669
We just dip it.

59
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,939
What happened?

60
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:11,040
What happened is,

61
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:12,408
I saved your life.

62
00:04:12,476 --> 00:04:14,677
Now, you's had a rough day.

63
00:04:14,745 --> 00:04:17,080
Why don't you have
a pull on this?

64
00:04:18,615 --> 00:04:19,816
Where's the hooch?

65
00:04:19,883 --> 00:04:22,118
Oh, excuse my faux pas.

66
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:24,287
That jug was fo' pa.

67
00:04:26,824 --> 00:04:27,957
Come on, now.

68
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:30,326
We'll go on back
to the still.

69
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:33,162
And in case we run
into trouble...

70
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,464
oh, Brandine!

71
00:04:34,531 --> 00:04:36,666
Where is the bazook?

72
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:41,204
Oh, he's gonna shoot
those Google Earth folks

73
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:44,107
what caught me
with my breeches down.

74
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:47,977
This here's my pride and joy:
'ol Betsy.

75
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:51,347
A female that gives birth
to alcohol.

76
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:53,916
Now, gentlemen, let us toast

77
00:04:53,984 --> 00:04:56,786
our new friend's escape
from death's icy grip

78
00:04:56,854 --> 00:04:59,389
with my latest batch
of whoopee water.

79
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,761
So, what y'all think?

80
00:05:04,828 --> 00:05:06,896
Yeah, yeah, yeah, good.

81
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:10,900
It angrys up my fists!

82
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:13,870
I just remembered my feud
with this here tree!

83
00:05:13,937 --> 00:05:16,739
Get her done. Get her done.

84
00:05:18,342 --> 00:05:20,476
What's your take,
city boy?

85
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:22,345
Well, uh...

86
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:26,649
It's got a rich mash base
and a sense of danger.

87
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:30,119
And I detect notes
of elderberry, tobacco, oak--

88
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:32,155
No, poison oak--

89
00:05:32,222 --> 00:05:34,057
And hints of game.

90
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:37,727
That is amazing!

91
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,329
You have the eloquence
and urgency

92
00:05:40,397 --> 00:05:43,733
of a census worker
caught in a bear trap.

93
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,135
We's gonna invite you
to all our soirees,

94
00:05:46,203 --> 00:05:47,804
mixers and drink-'em-ups.

95
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:52,175
Now let's enjoy
the bluegrass stylings

96
00:05:52,242 --> 00:05:54,444
of the country bear jamboree.

97
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:09,492
So, you guys have
any video games?

98
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,827
Nope, but my mama
brought some

99
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:13,596
of these boom potatoes
back from Iraq.

100
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:26,409
Set 'em up again.

101
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,280
So, I'll hide,
and you guys

102
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:33,149
count to 100.

103
00:06:33,217 --> 00:06:34,484
One.
Two.

104
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:35,651
Backwards "e".

105
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:36,719
One-legged triangle.

106
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:37,820
Banana hot dog.

107
00:06:37,888 --> 00:06:39,255
Double banana hot dog.

108
00:06:39,323 --> 00:06:40,823
60 corncob two.

109
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:45,695
This is the best hiding place.

110
00:06:45,762 --> 00:06:47,830
They'll never find me.

111
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:51,868
I'm here.

112
00:06:51,935 --> 00:06:53,069
Come find me.

113
00:06:53,137 --> 00:06:54,871
Olly olly oxen free.

114
00:06:54,938 --> 00:06:57,473
Olly olly oxen free!

115
00:07:00,277 --> 00:07:03,179
Why did I do poetry club
instead of girl scouts?

116
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:06,215
Why did I do poetry club instead
of girl scouts?

117
00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:08,818
<i>Dark is she,
but brilliant.

118
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,455
<i>Black are her wings--
black on black.

119
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:15,525
<i>She is Lilith,

120
00:07:15,592 --> 00:07:18,961
<i>who leadeth forth the hordes
of the abyss.

121
00:07:28,172 --> 00:07:30,540
You are going to
be so embarrassed.

122
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:32,375
There are two other
people at this party

123
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:33,910
dressed just like you.

124
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,250
State thy business.

125
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:41,452
My name's Lisa,
and I was playing hide-and-seek

126
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,921
when I met you ladies.

127
00:07:42,988 --> 00:07:44,389
Please don't hurt me.

128
00:07:44,456 --> 00:07:45,990
We're not going
to hurt you.

129
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:48,593
But we don't like outsiders
observing our esbat.
Uh-huh.

130
00:07:48,661 --> 00:07:50,061
What's an esbat?

131
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:52,864
An ancient ritual
in celebration of the full moon.

132
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:54,165
We're Wiccans.

133
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:55,400
You mean witches?

134
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:56,768
Technically...

135
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:58,436
But we're not
into broomsticks

136
00:07:58,504 --> 00:08:00,238
or pointy hats.

137
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:02,473
Well, I'm glad
you're not witches.

138
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,510
Wouldn't want you
to cast a spell on me.

139
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:07,312
Oh, we cast spells.

140
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:09,147
And they work.

141
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,715
Sure, they do.

142
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:13,218
If magic was real,
I'd use it to get out

143
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,653
of my pipe cleaner art project
that's due tomorrow.

144
00:08:16,922 --> 00:08:19,324
You should keep
an open mind.

145
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:20,959
Things said in the circle

146
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:22,861
have a surprising way
of coming true.

147
00:08:22,928 --> 00:08:25,230
Lisa. Lisa!

148
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:28,399
Dad, over here!

149
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:29,734
Come, sisters
of the elements.

150
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:32,270
Let us leave this place
in a manner most wiccan.

151
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:33,571
What are you
talking about?

152
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,340
Text your mom
to pick us up.

153
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:39,644
Oh, sweetie,
I found you.

154
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:41,546
Now, who's going
to find us?

155
00:08:41,614 --> 00:08:43,381
Help!

156
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:48,286
Uh-oh.

157
00:08:54,393 --> 00:08:57,528
I have one minute to avoid
my first late assignment ever.

158
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:02,033
The pipe cleaner fur
is coming off on my hands.

159
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:08,740
Class, Miss Hoover
will not be in today,

160
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:10,675
so you all get A's

161
00:09:10,743 --> 00:09:12,477
on your pipe cleaner
sculptures.

162
00:09:14,213 --> 00:09:15,280
Yes!
Ha ha!

163
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:18,249
What happened to Miss Hoover?

164
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:20,585
Came down with a spell
of stomach flu.

165
00:09:20,653 --> 00:09:22,253
Spell? Those girls couldn't

166
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:24,422
have made her sick...
Or could they?

167
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,525
Maybe we'll pass the time
with another craft project.

168
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:29,260
I'll let one of you pick.

169
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:30,561
Uh... Lisa.

170
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:31,963
Which craft?

171
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:34,732
Which craft?

172
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:38,469
Which craft?!

173
00:09:40,806 --> 00:09:42,840
This here country is home

174
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:45,610
to over 300
family-owned stills.

175
00:09:45,678 --> 00:09:48,379
None of them big
corporate moonshiners,

176
00:09:48,447 --> 00:09:50,348
like crazy-think
white lightning

177
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,451
or Dwayne Saggery's
demento juice.

178
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,854
So, let's go taste some
independent hooch!

179
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:26,918
Hey, thanks for bringing us
down here, Homer.

180
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:28,453
Yeah. There's
something wonderful

181
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,221
about being
drunk outdoors.

182
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:31,889
I wonder if
Moe misses us.

183
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:33,424
No, I don't miss you.

184
00:10:33,492 --> 00:10:36,060
Now, get back to my bar
for happy hour,

185
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:39,197
or I'll paint the snow pink
with your brains.

186
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:45,336
Drop your fire sticks,
man possum.

187
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:47,638
Oh, uh, so, uh... So I guess
this means you hillbillies

188
00:10:47,706 --> 00:10:49,407
are going to have your way
with me, huh?

189
00:10:49,475 --> 00:10:50,908
Oh, for god's sake.

190
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:52,944
You know, one hillbilly
has his way

191
00:10:53,012 --> 00:10:55,146
with one fat guy in deliverance,

192
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:58,449
and suddenly, people think
that's all hillbillies do.

193
00:10:58,517 --> 00:11:02,020
<i>I suppose you think all space
is Star Wars.

194
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:04,122
No, I... I thought we had
a connection here,

195
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:06,290
and we're out in the woods
and everything, and...

196
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:09,660
Hey, forget it!
I...I ain't gonna beg for it.

197
00:11:09,728 --> 00:11:11,896
You'll never know
what you missed out on.

198
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:21,839
Did you girls make
Miss Hoover sick?

199
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:26,110
Oh, no, we would never ask
the goddess to harm a teacher.

200
00:11:26,178 --> 00:11:28,479
But if the goddess
chose to help you

201
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:31,416
by giving Miss Hoover
the hershey squirts,

202
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,384
such is her divine wisdom.

203
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:37,555
Oh, listen, not that
I've lost my skepticism,

204
00:11:37,623 --> 00:11:39,891
but I am interested
in learning more about Wiccans.

205
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,125
Are you a minority group

206
00:11:41,193 --> 00:11:42,794
as defined by
Ivy League admissions?

207
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:43,961
Cornell and Dartmouth.

208
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:45,396
What else ya got?

209
00:11:45,464 --> 00:11:46,731
We worship nature.

210
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,366
I worship nature!

211
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:49,801
Want to join us?

212
00:11:49,868 --> 00:11:52,470
Well, it is an honor
to be asked.

213
00:11:52,538 --> 00:11:53,838
But I never make
a final decision

214
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:55,740
in the middle of a
forest at night.

215
00:11:55,808 --> 00:11:57,208
Hey, hey,
that's smart thinkin'!

216
00:11:57,276 --> 00:11:58,509
Shut up and dig
your own grave.

217
00:11:58,577 --> 00:11:59,710
What if I don't dig it?

218
00:11:59,778 --> 00:12:01,012
What are you gonna do then?

219
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,047
Guess I'll have to
dig it for ya.

220
00:12:03,115 --> 00:12:05,950
With your bad back?
Forget about it!

221
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:10,688
Hmm...

222
00:12:15,661 --> 00:12:17,662
Is that a pentagram?

223
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:21,032
Lis! You've finally come
over to the dark side!

224
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,301
Um, it's the Wiccan home page.

225
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,070
I'm thinking of joining.

226
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:27,672
No, no, no.

227
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:29,740
You're too young
to be a witch.

228
00:12:29,808 --> 00:12:32,477
Savor the steps
leading up to it.

229
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,079
College anorexic,
string of bad marriages,

230
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:37,915
career disappointments,
failed pottery shop.

231
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:39,684
And then when you're
old and alone,

232
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:41,652
you can hit
the witch thing hard.

233
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:49,694
Hey, every witch
needs a familiar.

234
00:12:49,761 --> 00:12:52,897
I'm gonna put a spell on you!
Yes, I am,

235
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:54,665
my tuna-breath familiar.

236
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,968
Zap! Zap! Zap!

237
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:58,569
Zap! Zap! Zap!

238
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:00,138
I curse you, hell's kitten!

239
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:02,073
Just as I feared.

240
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:04,375
Her buddhism has led
directly to witchcraft.

241
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:09,814
and she's
teleconferencing the devil

242
00:13:09,882 --> 00:13:11,549
using that computer from hell!

243
00:13:11,617 --> 00:13:13,484
I think it says "Dell."

244
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:15,186
We'll let the authorities
sort that out.

245
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,200
Mmm, not bad.

246
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:32,436
What's that twirly ruckus?

247
00:13:32,504 --> 00:13:34,906
The gummiment!

248
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,653
Initiate, how does one
enter the circle?

249
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,656
With perfect faith
and perfect love.

250
00:13:51,723 --> 00:13:55,760
Join us, join us, join us.

251
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,631
Do not sanctify that witch!

252
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:07,905
I kinda feel sorry for them,
crammed in that back seat.

253
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,308
Toss them a judy blume
novel, Lou.

254
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,310
<i>Uh, all we've got
is Wifey, chief.

255
00:14:12,377 --> 00:14:13,644
Nothing with kids in it?

256
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:15,880
Damn budget cuts.

257
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:20,966
Burn, burn,
burn! Burn, burn, burn!

258
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:24,536
Double bubble boil and trouble?

259
00:14:24,603 --> 00:14:25,737
Today, Springfield will see

260
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:28,606
its first witch trials
in 12 years.

261
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:30,608
Oh, I think I see
the witches now.

262
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:32,210
This reporter
has never encountered

263
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:34,112
such disfigured crones.

264
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,647
We're not the witches!

265
00:14:35,714 --> 00:14:37,248
Oh, well then
you must be victims

266
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:39,150
of the witches'
hideous curse.

267
00:14:39,218 --> 00:14:42,220
You didn't think I was so
hideous that night we made out

268
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:44,189
in the back booth
at the seafood hut.

269
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:46,391
We all did crazy
things on 9/11.

270
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:47,959
Ah, here come the witches.

271
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:50,361
Do you have a statement
for us mortals?

272
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:53,898
Goddess Lilith, who knows
our hearts are pure...

273
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:58,169
Oh, Queen of Magic, show our
persecutors that they are blind.

274
00:14:58,237 --> 00:15:00,171
They are blind!

275
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:04,542
I'm blind! I'm blind!

276
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,444
What goes around,
comes around.

277
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,485
Dear, god, I've gone blind.

278
00:15:13,552 --> 00:15:15,720
Nurse, you'll have
to be my eyes.

279
00:15:15,788 --> 00:15:17,722
I'm blind, too!

280
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,358
Then I guess it's up to me.

281
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:28,933
Gwendolyn Nightshadow,

282
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:31,603
did you use
your supernatural powers

283
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,838
to blind half this town?

284
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:35,340
We're just kids.

285
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:37,709
My real name isn't even
Gwendolyn Nightshadow.

286
00:15:37,776 --> 00:15:40,245
It's Stacey, Stacey Deathsatan.

287
00:15:43,349 --> 00:15:44,816
So...

288
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:47,018
The defendants recruited you,

289
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:50,155
a young innocent,
into their evil coven.

290
00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:51,723
They're not evil!

291
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,725
They believe in friendship
and respecting the earth.

292
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:55,560
And they made me feel
like I belonged.

293
00:15:55,628 --> 00:15:58,363
Your honor, I'd like to enter
something into the record.

294
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,531
Strangely, I'll allow it.

295
00:15:59,598 --> 00:16:00,999
Ladies and gentlemen,

296
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:02,867
I am a big dummy
with a stupid job.

297
00:16:02,935 --> 00:16:04,302
I write down what
other people say,

298
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,137
just like a big dummy would.

299
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:08,339
Could the court reporter
read that back?

300
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:11,142
"I am a big dummy
with a stupid job"?!

301
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,244
Hey!

302
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:16,881
In all my years
of being a judge,

303
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:18,816
I've never seen
such a flimsy case.

304
00:16:18,884 --> 00:16:20,218
Are you sure?

305
00:16:20,286 --> 00:16:22,086
'cause we've brought you
a lot of flimsy cases.

306
00:16:22,154 --> 00:16:24,923
Like that goat we accused
of income tax evasion.

307
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,391
I still think he was guilty.

308
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:30,695
Well, I'm not wasting
another minute on this.

309
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:31,996
Case dismissed!

310
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:35,800
There's no justice here.

311
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:37,635
They made me blind!

312
00:16:37,703 --> 00:16:39,704
And now I can really
hear how I bomb!

313
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:42,340
Well, I say we take them out
and have our own trial!

314
00:16:45,277 --> 00:16:47,478
Oh, uh, don't mind me.

315
00:16:47,546 --> 00:16:49,581
I'm just trying to get
a fly on the ceiling.

316
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:53,952
Ah, I got you now.

317
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,193
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

318
00:16:59,261 --> 00:17:00,594
Burn the witch!

319
00:17:00,662 --> 00:17:02,062
Not so fast!

320
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,332
As citizens, we are still
bound by the rule of law.

321
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Boo!

322
00:17:06,468 --> 00:17:08,235
17th-century law!

323
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:12,873
I have reconstructed
the ultimate instrument

324
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:16,010
of colonial justice:
the dunking stool.

325
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,312
If the alleged witches
survive the dunking,

326
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,414
they clearly were witches!

327
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:24,018
If they drown, then they
were clearly innocent.

328
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,719
After this,
it will be featured

329
00:17:25,787 --> 00:17:27,822
in the fifth-grade play,
the crucible.

330
00:17:27,889 --> 00:17:29,323
Good seats still available.

331
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:32,660
By which I mean, seats in the
back where you can fall asleep.

332
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:41,702
Don't dip those Wiccans!

333
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,238
They didn't blind anyone.

334
00:17:44,306 --> 00:17:45,573
I have proof!

335
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,475
When my father was attending

336
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,277
<i>the moonshine competition
last Saturday...

337
00:17:50,345 --> 00:17:52,680
You said you were
at a parenting class!

338
00:17:52,747 --> 00:17:54,181
Marge, please.

339
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:56,116
You're embarrassing me
in front of the mob.

340
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:57,685
...You heard sirens, which
you thought were police

341
00:17:57,752 --> 00:17:59,620
coming to arrest you.

342
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:01,288
To ditch their stills,

343
00:18:01,356 --> 00:18:03,958
<i>the moonshiners
pushed them down a hill.

344
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:05,960
<i>The moonshine
landed in a river,

345
00:18:06,027 --> 00:18:09,230
<i>temporarily blinding anyone
or anything that drank it.

346
00:18:17,272 --> 00:18:19,673
<i>That river led to the reservoir

347
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:22,109
<i>which made anyone who drank
the town's tap water

348
00:18:22,177 --> 00:18:25,012
<i>also go temporarily blind.

349
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,615
Moonshine in the water?

350
00:18:27,682 --> 00:18:29,183
I'll be the judge of that.

351
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:34,054
Hmm...

352
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,992
Hillbilly moonshine!

353
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:39,727
The little witch is right!

354
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:48,502
Wait, wait, wait, don't unform!
You're a great mob!

355
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,571
We'll think of something else
to get upset about!

356
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:53,374
How about all that construction
on Route 1, huh?

357
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:54,842
Huh?

358
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,578
Oh, you ain't no mob.

359
00:18:57,646 --> 00:18:59,513
You're just a bunch of
spineless weasels.

360
00:19:00,949 --> 00:19:02,483
Hey, hey, hey, it's
just a figure of speech.

361
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,051
Kill the weasel hater!

362
00:19:05,587 --> 00:19:08,289
Now this is what
I'm talking about!

363
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:11,191
Sister Lisa, thank you
for saving us.

364
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:12,660
You were awesome.

365
00:19:12,727 --> 00:19:14,261
No, thank you.

366
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:16,797
I've been rational
but nerdy my whole life.

367
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:20,234
But these past few weeks,
you girls made me feel cool.

368
00:19:20,302 --> 00:19:24,605
Cool! Me, Lisa Simpson!

369
00:19:24,673 --> 00:19:27,608
Well, I think you're
very interesting girls,

370
00:19:27,676 --> 00:19:29,376
but from now on,

371
00:19:29,444 --> 00:19:31,679
the only "witch"
in Lisa's life

372
00:19:31,746 --> 00:19:33,747
is which boy
will marry her.

373
00:19:33,815 --> 00:19:35,749
Right, Homer? Homer?

374
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:37,151
Start the ride!

375
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:43,691
Again!

376
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:49,296
Huh?
Hmm.
Hmm.
