00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,919
(theme music playing)

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,548
CHORUS: <i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

3
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,852
(bell ringing)

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,108
(whistle blowing)

5
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,864
(beeping)

6
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,874
(playing the blues)

7
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,893
(honking horn)

8
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,066
D'oh! (screams)

9
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,192
(brakes screeching)

10
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,986
(moaning)

11
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,905
(evil laughter)

12
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,585
These Swedish furniture designers

13
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,754
sure have some far-out ideas.

14
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,756
I mean, a green table?

15
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,717
I wouldn't have thought of that
in my wildest dreams.

16
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,512
And these bean bag chairs
look so comfortable.

17
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,138
(sighing) Oops!

18
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,807
Hey, there's someone else in here.

19
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,975
SEA CAPTAIN: Argh, she swallowed me whole.

20
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,061
You put it together yourself.

21
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,938
All you need is me, Allen Wrench.

22
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:45,980
(laughing)

23
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,857
He's named after what he is.

24
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,900
(clanging)

25
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,443
Cool costume.

26
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,403
(in mechanical voice) It's not a costume.

27
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,782
They found me inside a meteor.

28
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,700
Excuse me, where are your hamper lids?

29
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,786
(in normal voice) Hamper lids?
Uh, third floor.

30
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,580
(in mechanical voice) Help!
I need tungsten to live.

31
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,457
Tungsten!

32
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,875
Whoa...

33
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,962
Ooh, look at all these
clever pencil holders.

34
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,090
Ooh! I want to get the Kronk.

35
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:16,052
Mmm. You don't want something
that overshadows the pencils.

36
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,887
How about this... Popli?

37
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,389
Mom, no!

38
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,474
Everyone at school picks on
the Popli kids,

39
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,934
even I do!

40
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,894
I just hate them so much.

41
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,773
Yes, I will have the polpenlugen

42
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,775
and don't skimp on the doodlemunch.

43
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,027
How ingenious!

44
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,988
The forks are made out of Lego.

45
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,950
Hmm!

46
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,703
Hello, Simpsons!

47
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,413
Hey, Apu, Manjula.

48
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,747
You guys are still married?

49
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,249
Oh, yes, sir, quite happily.

50
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,333
Pay up, Marge.

51
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,085
Say, what you got there?

52
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,545
I don't know, exactly.

53
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,506
It's from the room of lamps
that do not look like lamps.

54
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,384
(electrical surging)

55
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,677
(cooing)

56
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,930
Oh, little Maggie, aren't you cute

57
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,265
with your little bow?

58
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,185
(singsong babbling)

59
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,353
Maggie loves baby talk.

60
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,898
-That was Hindi.
-(chuckling) Oh. Sorry.

61
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,691
So, have you two thought about kids?

62
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,568
Well, sure we have, but the decision

63
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,862
to have a child is not to be made lightly.

64
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,071
(blowing raspberries)

65
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,531
(giggling)

66
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,159
On the other hand, monkey see, monkey do.

67
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,494
(chuckling) Kids are the best, Apu.

68
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,705
You can teach them to hate
the things you hate.

69
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,248
And they practically raise themselves

70
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,666
what with the Internet and all.

71
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,460
Well, perhaps it is time.

72
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,796
I've noticed this country
is dangerously underpopulated.

73
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,467
Are you sure you want a child, Apu?

74
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,968
You know I do.

75
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,720
I mean, there comes a time in a man's life

76
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,222
when he asks himself,

77
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,474
"Who will float my corpse
down the Ganges?"

78
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,851
Oh, Apu, take me now.

79
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,604
APU: Oh, Calcutta!

80
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,609
Hey, Apu, sitting
in the ice cream cooler, eh?

81
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,070
By chilling my loins,
I increase the chances

82
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,571
of impregnating my wife.

83
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,157
Whoa-ho, too much information.

84
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,117
Thanks for the mental picture.

85
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,370
Why don't you tell us
what you really think?

86
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,580
Would you stop spouting
those hackneyed quips?

87
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,250
Could you be any more...

88
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,376
Hello?

89
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,003
(laughing)

90
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,421
Look, just give me some ice cream.

91
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,677
Um. How about one not touching your ass?

92
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,928
-(pager beeps)
-Oh!

93
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,596
Manjula has begun to ovulate.

94
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,639
Ew...

95
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,057
Thanks for sharing...

96
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,644
more than I wanted to know!

97
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,398
Here goes nothing.

98
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,901
BOTH: Baby...

99
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:37,986
Baby...

100
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,113
Oh... lemon.

101
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,448
All that sex for nothing.

102
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,451
Well, that is a pretty grim assessment.

103
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,080
You know, Homer, you might want

104
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,499
to open those cans before they explode.

105
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:54,002
But the cans seal in the flavor.

106
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,378
OK.

107
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,423
So, how's the tribe coming along?

108
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,465
Any papooses?

109
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,217
No. Still no luck.

110
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,679
Tell me, Homer,
did you have to take any...

111
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,348
special steps when you
decided to have children?

112
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,599
"Decided"?

113
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,518
(laughing)

114
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,895
That's classic! "Decided."

115
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,647
Babies just happen.

116
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,816
Well, not to us, they don't.

117
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,776
Oh, Homer, we have tried everything.

118
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,862
Oysters, gravity boots,

119
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,781
Sanjay's bed, every possible position.

120
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,866
Really?

121
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,993
On top and underneath?

122
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,870
Eh... yes.

123
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,039
Well, don't worry, I can help you.

124
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,499
I'm all about ideas.

125
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,376
Kids! Come and get it!

126
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,213
Now, this situation is guaranteed

127
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,840
to end in pregnancy.

128
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,134
I'm willing to play the high school jock,

129
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,511
but did you have to cut
the roof off my car?

130
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,889
Hup-hup-hup-hup. That's an Apu question.

131
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,223
You're "Greg."

132
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,518
"Uh, gee, Betsy, it's such a nice night.

133
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,354
-Why don't we go all the way?
-(Homer mouthing along)

134
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,773
"But Greg, my dad will kill me.

135
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,441
"And you have that scholarship

136
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,984
to Ivy League State."

137
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,694
"Loosen up, baby.

138
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,030
Tomorrow I'm shipping off to Vietnam."

139
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,075
I thought I was going to Ivy League State.

140
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,701
My mistake. Stay in the moment.

141
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,578
"Just promise not to forget me

142
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,081
on your dinosaur-bone- digging-up trip."

143
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,290
(sighing)

144
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,792
(kissing)

145
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,836
And that's my cue to exit.

146
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,177
Homer!

147
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,805
I just wanted to invite
you to the wrap party.

148
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,808
And that's my cue to exit.

149
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,267
(Homer humming)

150
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,605
BOTH: Baby...

151
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:38,773
Baby...

152
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,817
Pirate?

153
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,402
(sighing)

154
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,653
No, no, wait a minute!

155
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,779
Pirates are wild!

156
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:45,988
We are pregnant!

157
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,117
(both laughing)

158
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,910
APU: Oh! Oh, get lost.

159
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,999
Man, the last nine months sure were crazy.

160
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,086
I'll say. I learned the true meaning
of Columbus Day.

161
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,505
I enjoyed a brief but memorable stint

162
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,132
as sideshow Marge.

163
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,467
I became the most popular girl in school

164
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,428
But blew it by being conceited.

165
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,847
And then I learned
the true meaning of winter.

166
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,227
Apu, do you still find me attractive?

167
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,354
Of course I do, sweetheart.

168
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,607
You are beautiful and silky
and manageable.

169
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,860
You're reading that off
a conditioner bottle.

170
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,945
I... That's true.

171
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,447
But you still have a...

172
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,739
(water splashing)

173
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,907
Ooh! Oh.

174
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,242
My water broke.

175
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,827
Oh, we must drive to the hospital.

176
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,955
<i>Cleanup in aisle three.</i>

177
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,207
Oh, finally.

178
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,086
Gil's moving up to the big leagues, boy.

179
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,129
Aah!

180
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,672
Aw, my back...

181
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,427
(all snoring)

182
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,887
Apu, come quick!

183
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,638
You're missing the miracle!

184
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,764
Oh?

185
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,268
Oh, my sweet husband,

186
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,605
say hello to your firstborn child.

187
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:04,233
Oh. You shall be the jewel of our lives.

188
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,903
Aw... Now, say hello
to your other seven children.

189
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,946
My... what?

190
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,199
(laughing) We had quite a discussion

191
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,451
about the funniest way
to reveal them to you.

192
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,328
You have octuplets.

193
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:19,999
It rolls off your tongue
and into your heart, "octuplets."

194
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,375
(laughing)

195
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,711
Apu, you should have seen your face

196
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:27,006
when they showed you
those babies. (laughing)

197
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,926
Yeah. It looked just like that.

198
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,350
Apu, say hello to Poonam, Sashi

199
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,228
Pria, Uma, Anoop, Sandeep, Nabendu

200
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,396
and Mama's clear favorite, Gheet.

201
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,814
APU: How did we get eight?

202
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,608
Apu, I must confess.

203
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,485
When we were having trouble conceiving,

204
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,654
I took fertility drugs.

205
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,863
(moans)

206
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,823
I, too, I am afraid, am guilty

207
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,951
of monkeying with nature.

208
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,954
I slipped fertility drugs
into your breakfast squishy.

209
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,497
Mm-hmm...

210
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,874
Well, that would only account
for quintuplets.

211
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,418
Did anyone else slip
this woman fertility drugs?

212
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,589
Mine tasted like strawberry.

213
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,967
Mmm. Ovulicious.

214
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,887
(shutters clicking)

215
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,347
Would you say you and your babies

216
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,141
have a "love-eight" relationship?

217
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,434
(all chuckling)

218
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,061
(chuckling) Absolutely. Yes.

219
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,230
No. Say it. We need a sound bite.

220
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,941
We have a "love-eight" relationship.

221
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,025
ALL: Aw.

222
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,652
Yes. Kent Brockman, Channel Six.

223
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,362
How would you respond to people who say

224
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,030
this kind of multiple birth

225
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:37,285
is more suited to, say,
a possum than a human being?

226
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,579
Wha-- Who would say such a thing?

227
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,831
Well... Pundits, wags...

228
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,874
I'm not the one on trial here.

229
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,209
No one is on trial.

230
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,003
This is a joyous occasion for all,

231
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,213
and the outpouring of support
has been so lucrative.

232
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,090
Yes. We have already received

233
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:54,176
lifetime supplies
of baby powder and Pepsi-B.

234
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,512
Free baby cola?

235
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,055
Apu hits the jackpot

236
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,850
and I'm stuck with
these useless one-tuplets.

237
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,311
Gee, sorry for being born.

238
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,022
I've been waiting so long to hear that.

239
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,486
(forklift beeping)

240
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,657
How do you feel about this avalanche
of free merchandise?

241
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,160
Oh, the companies are so generous.

242
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,995
Except the Q-tip people.

243
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,164
They only gave us three crates.

244
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,540
They can rot in hell.

245
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,125
But the good folks at Sony...

246
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,209
(loud kiss)

247
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,963
Their giant TV will really
help us love our babies.

248
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,591
<i>I'm here at Shelbyville Hospital</i>

249
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,426
<i>where a local woman has just given birth</i>

250
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,887
<i>to nine, that's right, nine babies.</i>

251
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,096
(both gasp)

252
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,973
<i>Some say eight babies is a blessing,</i>

253
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,267
<i>but they don't know the joy of nine.</i>

254
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,770
<i>Would you say you're on cloud nine?</i>

255
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,897
BOTH: <i>We're on cloud nine!</i>

256
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,023
ALL: <i>Aw.</i>

257
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,359
Oh. They even have
a better sound bite than us.

258
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,487
Nine babies? That's barbaric!

259
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,157
Nonuplets? Now, that's something
you don't see every day.

260
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,909
Let's get this stuff to the real heroes,

261
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,744
the Shelbyville Nine!

262
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,123
Oh.

263
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,377
Wait! That's our ottoman!

264
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,381
(sighs)

265
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,299
Don't worry, my little curry-face.

266
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,635
We don't need corporate handouts.

267
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,054
Our children will live on love.

268
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,348
(babies crying)

269
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,683
(groaning)

270
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,726
(crying)

271
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,396
(singing to the tune of
"Rock-A-Bye Baby" in Hindi)

272
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,856
(crying continues)

273
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,192
(snoring)

274
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,152
Apu! It's 4:00 a.m.

275
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,570
You are late for work.

276
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,491
Oh. I just had the most
beautiful dream where I died.

277
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,577
Oh, no, you don't, not till
they're out of college.

278
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,121
Listen, I'll die when I want to.

279
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,916
(wheels squeaking)

280
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,335
Thank you. Steal again.

281
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,586
(door sensor rings)

282
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,213
Well, morning, Apu.

283
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,923
How are the little blessings?

284
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,426
Ooh, they're a ravenous swarm of locusts,

285
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,970
just eating and screaming
and grabbing and poking

286
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,471
and pulling and drooling

287
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,889
and two have cradle rash.

288
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,057
How do you get cradle rash

289
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,684
when you sleep in a suitcase?

290
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,727
(chuckling)

291
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,186
They can be a handful...

292
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,980
-of joy.
-Shut up!

293
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,606
They'll fill your lives with...

294
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,899
Just shut up!

295
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,192
Can't put a price on a miracle.

296
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,736
I can't believe you don't shut up.

297
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,571
-(clicking)
-HOMER: Oh, look at that.

298
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,823
Ooh, a gingerbread house.

299
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,200
Hansel and Gretel are set for life.

300
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,703
You know, I saw Apu today.

301
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,580
He's really frazzled.

302
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,000
Boy, that Hansel sure can eat.

303
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,710
Ah! My corneas!

304
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,753
You were saying?

305
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,423
Apu told me all eight babies have colic.

306
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,966
Although, he thinks one or two

307
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,343
might just be going along with the crowd.

308
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,721
Eight kids. Hmm.

309
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,514
I'm sterile, right, baby doll?

310
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,476
Yes, dear, from the nuclear plant.

311
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,935
Beautiful.

312
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,062
(doorbell ringing)

313
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,148
Knock, knock.

314
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,400
Hmm.

315
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,485
Apu?

316
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,361
Manjula?

317
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,615
Marge, I've got a bad feeling about this.

318
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,701
(both gasp)

319
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,745
Welcome to my nightmare.

320
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,206
I know you had your hands full
with the babies

321
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,792
So I baked you some banana bread.

322
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,085
Oh, hallelujah, our problems are solved.

323
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,504
We have banana bread.

324
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,881
Well, you don't have to be sarcastic.

325
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,760
Oh, look, who's here.
The family with one baby.

326
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,012
How do you manage?

327
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:28,057
Marge, they've turned into jerks.

328
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,850
I'm very sorry. We've been rude.

329
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,019
Can I offer you something to drink?

330
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,604
-No, thanks.
-No, thanks.

331
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,023
Apu, they're doing it again.

332
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,818
-OK, break it up.
-(babies cooing)

333
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,820
Maybe you two should get a nanny.

334
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,322
Yes, and what would
I pay her with? Banana bread?

335
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,075
Sorry, sorry. It's just
we haven't slept in days

336
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,910
and we're running out of money and...

337
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,953
Banana bread?

338
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,454
What the hell were you thinking?

339
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,539
Banana bread.

340
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,541
I apologize, apologize again.

341
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,750
As a token of forgiveness,

342
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,210
-please take this baby.
-Mmm.

343
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,586
No! Marge, no!

344
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,754
(doorbell ringing)

345
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,300
Mr. Nahasa... Pasa...

346
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,468
Aw, forget it.

347
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,846
Listen, you look like
you could use some help.

348
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,556
-Come with me.
-OK.

349
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,140
But you don't know who he is.

350
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,851
Who cares? There's only one of him.

351
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,521
What if your babies could live in a place

352
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,982
with round-the-clock child care,

353
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,734
all expenses paid, full medical,

354
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,653
dental, tutors, the works?

355
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,238
I would say that there must be

356
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,031
some sort of horrible catch.

357
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,452
The zoo?

358
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,621
What? Everybody loves my zoo.

359
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,956
You don't love my zoo?

360
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,875
I dare you to look at a kangaroo

361
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,084
and not laugh.

362
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,168
I dare you.

363
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,464
Well, they're usually funnier.

364
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,303
Look, I'm not going
to put my babies in a zoo.

365
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,430
Don't say no till you see the habitat.

366
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,431
The habitat?

367
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,599
I mean, the nursery.

368
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,059
Oh, my goodness.

369
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,857
Not too shabby, eh?
They'll have the best of care.

370
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,484
And all I ask is
that you let the local folks

371
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,820
share a little glimpse of your blessing.

372
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,948
But is it right to put such young children
on display?

373
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,408
-MAN: Sure, it is.
-Uh?

374
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,993
Butch Patrick?

375
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,161
That's right.

376
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,495
I was TV's Eddie Munster.

377
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,123
And being in the public eye
didn't mess me up one bit.

378
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,791
Mm-hmm.

379
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,126
Well, obviously.

380
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,669
Hey, one question, Eddie.

381
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,296
-Butch.
-Eh, right, right.

382
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,214
If your mother was a vampire

383
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,008
and your father was a Frankenstein,

384
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,384
how come you are a werewolf?

385
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,553
Huh. I never thought of that.

386
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,180
Doesn't make sense, does it?

387
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,057
But what does make sense
is putting your children

388
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,683
in the hands of Mr. Kidkill here.

389
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,478
Please, please... Larry. Larry Kidkill.

390
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,441
I don't care what Butch Patrick says.

391
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,568
It just doesn't seem right.

392
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,487
We wouldn't be giving the babies away.

393
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,947
We'd be moving in with them.

394
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,449
They'll have a traditional
"zoo-ish" upbringing.

395
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,161
Mmm. Mmm.

396
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,331
Well, maybe we could try it.

I can see on the meter it's good.

get off my stage.
