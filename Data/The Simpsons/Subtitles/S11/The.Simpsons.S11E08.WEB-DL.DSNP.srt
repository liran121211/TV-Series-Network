Oh, no, you're not getting me

we could use my rumpus room as our lair.

176
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,129
That guy just don't get it, do he?

177
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,924
My rumpus room
with the new bumper pool table?

178
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,133
-Bumper pool!
-You're kidding me.

179
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,218
(indistinct chatter)

180
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,765
The first meeting of Hell's Satans

181
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,141
is called to order.

182
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,018
I move we reconsider our club name.

183
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,020
Make it something
a little less blasphemous.

184
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,690
After all... (chuckles)
we don't want to go to hell.

185
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,441
How about the Devil's Pals?

186
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,652
-No.
-Or the Christ Punchers?

187
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,614
The Christ--
I don't think you understand my objection.

188
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,367
I'm the president
and the decision is mine.

189
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,952
We're Hell's Satans.

190
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,371
Besides, I already made our club jackets.

191
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,583
Oh, machine wash warm.

192
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,960
Tumble dry... ooh la la.

193
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,466
(rings bell)

194
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,759
Wait up, guys.

195
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,386
I got to empty my grass bag.

196
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,391
Hell's Satans, huh?

197
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,393
I'm watching you punks.

198
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,145
Can't hassle us, pig.

199
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,938
We're going the speed limit.

200
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,189
Oink, oink, oink.

201
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,401
(laughing and oinking)

202
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,903
You'll make a mistake some day,

203
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,947
and then you're going straight to juvie.

204
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,490
You can lock us away,

205
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,784
but you'll never defeat the Cobras.

206
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,746
-The Cobras?
-I thought you were the Hell's Satans.

207
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,332
Well, uh... Oink, oink, oink.

208
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,218
Oh, how can I be down a thousand bucks?

209
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,219
(bell pings)

210
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,597
Get away from my store,
you young hoodlums.

211
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,350
And what if we don't, pops?

212
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,311
-He's got a broom.
-Let's get out of here.

213
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,897
-Forget the pennies. Go, go!
-(moaning)

214
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,277
You promised me, no more brooms.

215
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,238
I know this is not your way,
but we're in America now.

216
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,496
(gasps) They printed my photo of our gang.

217
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,165
Oh, looks great.

218
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,917
Can't take a bad picture of that guy.

219
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,921
(gasps) You took a picture of me
when I was asleep?

220
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,632
If you'd been awake,
you would have said no.

221
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,217
You can see the bind I was in.

222
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,553
"Her turn-ons include thievery and liquor.

223
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,138
Her turn-offs include

224
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:25,101
underpants, pedestrians, and justice." Oh!

225
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,185
(people screaming)

226
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,728
What in the world?

227
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,535
(screams)

228
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,705
We're the Hell's Satans
out of Bakersfield.

229
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,039
You're the Hell's Satans?

230
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,791
What a fun coincidence.

231
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,084
My gang's name is also the--

232
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,919
Shut up!

233
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,338
You stole our club name.

234
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,174
According to our bylaws,
we got to stomp you.

235
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,259
(shrieks)

236
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,636
-Take off that jacket, man.
-OK.

237
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,598
-(gasping)
-Now, eat it.

238
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,683
(whimpering) All right.

239
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,227
(Homer chewing and swallowing)

240
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,401
Hey, hey, chew with your mouth closed,
please.

241
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,485
(muffled) Sorry.

242
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,321
Done.

243
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,450
OK, Meathook,
I think he learned his lesson.

244
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,993
Oh, man.

245
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,079
-Now you got to eat that, too.
-Oh!

246
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,457
You got anything else with our logo on it?

247
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,292
Caps and frisbees, sir.

248
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,085
You've got to eat them, too.

249
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,545
And some pogs.

250
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,923
("Me and the Boys" by NRBQ playing)

251
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,855
-Ew!
-Ah!

252
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,982
You keep it.

253
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,828
I think it's great
you've chosen to "crash" here,

254
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,289
but do you have to be so messy?

255
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,542
Yeah, it's part of being
a low-life. (spits)

256
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,628
(grunts)

257
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,801
Hello, police, can you send a SWAT team

258
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,262
to 742 Evergreen Terr--

259
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:29,391
Forget it, Simpson. Those pig noises
you made really hurt my feelings...

260
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,352
looking like a pig as I do.

261
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,646
But you have so much inner beauty.

262
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,815
Well, uh, be that as it may...

263
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,025
uh, the gang is wanted
in eight other states

264
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,152
and we have a little saying around here,

265
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,904
"Let Michigan handle it."

266
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,489
-(beep)
-(shudders)

267
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,826
(both growling)

268
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,829
(grunting)

269
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,375
-(grunts)
-Stop that!

270
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,670
If you want some food
I'll be happy to make you some breakfast.

271
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,046
I'd kill for some waffles.

272
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,882
He has. Remember the IHOP in Oakland?

273
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,844
(both laughing)

274
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,270
Hey, this is a lot better
than that rancid filth

275
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,688
we find in the dumpsters.

276
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,314
Thank you, Ramrod.

277
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,401
Marge, how did you get my jacket so clean?

278
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,571
I've tried everything to get those blood
and puke stains out.

279
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,990
I've tried hitting 'em,
I've tried yelling at 'em...

280
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:29,326
All it takes is the right cleanser
and a little elbow grease.

281
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,121
Do you have anything that will get
this emblem back on my jacket?

282
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,831
I tried spitting at it, you know, but...

283
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,875
Just put it on my sewing pile.

284
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,628
OK, I'm doing another load of bandannas.

285
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,048
(Bart humming)

286
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,343
Hey, hey, that's leave-in conditioner.

287
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,345
-You're done. Next.
-(shivers)

288
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,639
Dad, I'm tired of bathing in the yard,

289
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,309
plus I think Rod and Todd are watching.

290
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,060
No, we're not.

291
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:02,192
OK, bikers, that's it.
Benjamin Franklin once said

292
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,112
that house guests are like fish
that... that... huh?

293
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,823
They're gone. Whoo-hoo!

294
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,160
And those bikers saw
that hard look in my eye...

295
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,037
you know that hard look I get sometimes,

296
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,372
and they ran away like schoolgirls

297
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,374
with their tails between their legs.

298
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,252
(screams like a girl)

299
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,211
Way to go, Dad.

300
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,880
Hey, where's the food?

301
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,715
And why aren't I at school?

302
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,468
Yeah, someone really
dropped the ball here.

303
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,012
Marge? Marge?

304
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,348
Dad, there's a note
on the back of your head.

305
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,724
Really? Read it.

306
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:37,227
Hmm. "Thanks for letting us
crash in your pad.

307
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,687
We had a very nice time."

308
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,939
Aw, that's sweet.

309
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,398
"PS: We've taken your old lady."

310
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,358
D'oh!

311
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,280
(Marge screaming)

312
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,283
Could you at least tell me

313
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,160
what you're planning to do with me?

314
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,537
Oh, don't worry. You're completely safe.

315
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,291
-None of us finds you sexually attractive.
-None of you?

316
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,503
Really? I could have sworn that Ramrod...

317
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,715
Mm. Well, did you see
that picture of me in...

318
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,134
And you still don't...

319
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,552
Sorry.

320
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,347
Hmm. Well, good, I guess.

321
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,185
Now don't worry, I'm gonna search
high and low for your mother,

322
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,979
but just in case I don't find her...

323
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,272
I want you to contact this agency.

324
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,733
Korean love brides?

325
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,235
I just don't want to be alone.

326
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,456
(loud rock music blaring)

327
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,291
<i>♪ Well, look here, baby... ♪</i>

328
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,502
HOMER: Excuse me, has anyone seen
a woman wearing...

329
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,339
(music stops)

330
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,716
(grunting)

331
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,092
That's more like it.

332
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,635
I'm looking for-- (yells)

333
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,013
(music resumes)

334
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,016
(moaning) Ahhh!

335
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,020
(groans) I'll show you.

336
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,568
(clearing throat) OK, we kind of got off
on the wrong foot there.

337
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,946
Long story short, my "old lady" was--

338
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,826
Uh? Whazza-- (moaning)

339
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,120
Some people never learn.

340
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,204
-(blow landing)
-HOMER: Ahhh!

341
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,873
All right, Satans,

342
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,625
-we roll out at dawn.
-Where are we going?

343
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,379
To the bikers' jamboree
in South Dakota. You'll love it.

344
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,548
Mickey Rourke's coming
and we're going to jump him.

345
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:33,010
You know, there's more to life
than boozing and roughhousing.

346
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,386
(all gasping)

347
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,513
Haven't any of you ever had a dream?

348
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,223
Yeah, I had a dream.

349
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,392
I was in this beautiful garden

350
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,020
pounding the crap out of
a shopkeeper and then--

351
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:47,107
No, no, I mean the dream
of a good job, a loving family,

352
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,360
-and a home in the suburbs.
-Oh, man.

353
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,447
To get all that you'd have to
kill, like, 50 people.

354
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,657
No, you don't have to kill anyone.

355
00:17:55,741 --> 00:18:00,704
Not if you have jobs. And the first step
is an eye-catching "resumay."

356
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,290
No, I believe it's pronounced resume.

357
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,833
Actually both are acceptable.

358
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,294
Yeah, I did see some bikers

359
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,254
ride by here with a blue-haired woman

360
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,174
about ten minutes ago.
Said they were gonna spend the night

361
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:16,095
at Crystal Lake Campground,
section K, space 217.

362
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,347
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

363
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,099
I guess I'll never find her.

364
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,478
And when you get a job interview

365
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,606
try not to call your employer a punk...

366
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,733
-or a skank.
-Makes sense.

367
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,361
Oh, <i>don't </i>call them skanks.

368
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,113
Uh, Miss Simpson,

369
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,906
I killed my pencil.

370
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:39,868
Broke. You <i>broke </i>your pencil.

371
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,121
I broke him.

372
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,456
That's right,
and what else have we learned?

373
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,707
Oh, oh!

374
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,460
That, uh, violence is wrong.

375
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,420
Excellent, Ramrod.

376
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,215
Civilized people solve
their disputes with words.

377
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,967
(screams)

378
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,845
Homer, stop! No, you don't understand!

379
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,429
(screaming)

380
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,558
(screaming)

381
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,477
-(groans)
-Marge... What do we do here, Marge?

382
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,895
He's using violence.

383
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,064
Talk to him.

384
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,774
Use your words.

385
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,776
Homer, Homer, stop it.

386
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,070
We've given up our violent ways.

387
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,156
We just wanna live peacefully...

388
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,991
-with your wife.
-No!

389
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,369
My wife is not a doobie
to be passed around.

390
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,164
I took a sacred vow on my wedding day

391
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,374
to bogart her forever.

392
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,751
Oh, Homie.

393
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,171
There's only one reasonable way
to settle this...

394
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:36,008
you and me, in the circle of death.

395
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,635
Oh, I just swept the circle of death.

396
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,142
(both growling)

397
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,352
(chanting) Fight, fight, fight, fight.

398
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,855
(both grunting)

399
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,197
Uh-oh. (screaming)

400
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,119
(Homer grunts)

401
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,289
We both knew it'd come to this.

402
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,625
You and me, chopper to chopper.

403
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,211
(yelling and grunting)

404
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,847
You know what I'm gonna do
after I kill you?

405
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,391
-Take your wallet.
-Never.

406
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,310
It was a gift from <i>Newsweek.</i>

407
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,354
(screams)

408
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,813
-(Homer whimpering)
-MARGE: Homer!

409
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,275
(grunting)

410
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,324
Give me back my wife.

411
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,201
OK, OK, you win.

412
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,249
I don't blame you
for wanting her back so bad.

413
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,917
A woman like that only comes along

414
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,378
-every couple of miles.
-Ah.

415
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,589
Hey, can we at least keep her
till the orgy in San Berdoo?

416
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,466
-What do you say, honey?
-No!

417
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,343
No dice.

418
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,678
(engines idling)

419
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,597
Good-bye, everybody.

420
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,557
Bye, Mrs. Simpson.

421
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,726
-Good-bye, Marge.
-Bye-bye, Mrs. S.

422
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,980
We'll stop at the nearest town
and mail our "resumays."

423
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,357
Resumays... it still sounds weird to me.

424
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,036
Why are we stopping here?

425
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,456
Taking care of some unfinished business.

426
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,836
-MAN: Hey...
-HOMER: (screams) Go, go, go.

427
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,306
(theme music playing)

428
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,261
Shh!

429
