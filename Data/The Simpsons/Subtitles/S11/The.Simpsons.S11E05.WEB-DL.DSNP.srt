00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,078
<i>please deposit 10 cents.</i>

181
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:16,996
Eh, screw it.

182
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,332
(tires screech)

183
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,375
We can't go back home?

184
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,960
Where are we gonna live?

185
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,587
Ooh!
How 'bout that house?

186
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,755
LISA:
That has people living in it.

187
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,465
You can see them
through the windows.

188
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,133
Lousy showoffs.

189
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,010
Look! It's Jimmy Carter!

190
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,054
Could you build us a house,
President Carter?

191
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,847
We can't go back to ours.

192
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,141
I'm sorry.
These are for the truly needy.

193
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,769
Yeah.
Get your own habitat.

194
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,730
Come on, Carter.
Build us a house, you lazy bum!

195
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,149
You have offended me, sir.
I challenge you to--

196
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,192
(screams)

197
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,485
Come back here! Why,
you yellow-bellied--

198
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,405
-(horn honking)
-Come on! Move it!

199
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,991
-Where are we going, Dad?
-How should I know?

200
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,826
Then why are you driving
so fast?

201
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,954
'Cause I'm trying to think!

202
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,498
What would Zorro do?

203
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,961
Zorro!
(sobs)

204
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,505
"Rural Route 9"?

205
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,881
That's it!

206
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,050
We can hide out
at the farm where I grew up!

207
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,802
You mean Grampa's old farm?

208
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,262
Yeah. It'll be fun.

209
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,555
Fresh country air

210
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,599
apples for the picking,
sing-along hay rides.

211
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,976
BART: What a dump!

212
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,813
Race you to the swimmin' hole!

213
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,273
(laughing)

214
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,109
(gasps)

215
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,236
Come on, Ma! Bring the young-uns!

216
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,696
-There's no leeches!
-(rattling)

217
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,448
Ow, ow, ow!
Lots of snakes though!

218
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,741
(laughing)

219
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:36,659
Whoo!

220
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,169
Holy Moly! We can't stay here!

221
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,754
It's full of raccoons!

222
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,132
Just think of 'em as cats with rabies.

223
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,467
-(purrs)
-Hello, kitty.

224
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,719
Ow!

225
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,555
Oh, yeah, you little scamp!

226
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,224
Are we really gonna
live here and grow crops?

227
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,602
Absolutely.
This is our big chance.

228
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,228
The Simpsons will be reborn

229
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,397
as a bunch of gap-toothed bumpkins!

230
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,440
I'll dig an outhouse!

231
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,566
I'll weed the floor!

232
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,484
I'll repress the rage I'm feeling!

233
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,694
That's my girl.

234
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,738
Let the agriculture begin!

235
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,907
All right. Let's see
what the old girl can do.

236
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,160
-(engine starts)
-Mm-hmm.

237
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,413
It doesn't sound very tractor-y.

238
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,498
Hang on... and there.

239
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,666
(clattering, chugging)

240
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,877
(shouting)
Now we're talking!

241
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,878
(backfires)

242
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:29,879
D'oh!

243
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:30,880
Dad!

244
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,882
-Go get lassie!
-Lassie?

245
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,133
I mean Lisa.

246
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,805
Oh, you poor little sheep!

247
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,058
No one's sheared you for years.

248
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,643
(clippers buzzing)

249
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,896
All right.
Almost done, my little friend.

250
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,981
Soon you'll be a nice, cool...

251
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,441
(screams)
Rat!

252
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,234
(squeaking)

253
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,072
Well, well.

254
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,573
Look at the city slicker

255
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,909
pulling up in his
fancy German car.

256
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,160
This car was made in Guatemala.

257
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:05,039
Well, pardon us, Mr. Gucci loafers.

258
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,166
I bought these shoes from a hobo.

259
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,044
Well, la-dee-da,
Mr. Park Avenue manicure.

260
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,421
I'm sorry.
I believe in good grooming.

261
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,885
(groans)You're not gonna grow nothin'
on the old Simpson place.

262
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,470
That's why your daddy
abandoned it.

263
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,513
Oh, what do you know?

264
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,182
Well, I know your soil
Ph is up around 9.6

265
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,934
and you need
it seven to eight max.

266
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,352
Oh, that's just superstition!

267
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,689
You watch me.
I'll grow something out there.

268
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,316
Not if you're
plantin' gummy bears.

269
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,359
D'oh!

270
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,155
Ah! Wow, Dad!

271
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,116
This is the juiciest
watermelon I ever tasted.

272
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,493
Yeah. I hope I can
grow some like that.

273
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,494
What are you planting?

274
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,371
HOMER: Oh, a little bit of everything.

275
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,708
Something will thrive
in this harsh, merciless soil.

276
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,252
And for those
who face nature unafraid...

277
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,504
-It is they who reach...
-(crash)

278
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,256
-I'm down.
-Pa!

279
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,924
Move the hand brake!

280
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,384
(straining)

281
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,302
Ohh, that's heaven.

282
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,890
Oh, it's been a month.
Why won't anything grow?

283
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,268
Maybe it needs more fertilizer.

284
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,270
I'm only one man, Marge.

285
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,231
Well, it's probably
just a bad growing season.

286
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,608
Hot diggety! It's up to her eye!

287
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,902
-Time to harvest, boys!
-ALL: Whoo!

288
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,529
Nice work, Petunia.

289
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,740
-(sniffing)
-'Ere you go.

290
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,907
(growls)

291
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,870
Oh, who am I kidding?
I'm no farmer.

292
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,622
Well, if it isn't Mr. Salad Fork.

293
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,499
You couldn't grow stink on a monkey.

294
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,084
Leave me alone, you big bully.

295
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,795
Oh, I'm just razzin' ya. It's my way.

296
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,589
Here, have an ear on me.

297
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,924
(grunting)

298
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,302
More tumbleweed, Lisa?

299
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,346
(lisping) No, thanks.
I'm still finishing my thistles.

300
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,015
Dad, if we leave for town right now,

301
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,600
we could catch the dinner
special at Krusty Burger.

302
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,517
Sorry, boy.

303
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,895
Going back to Springfield
would be a coward's way out.

304
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,605
Wasn't skipping town
in the first place

305
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,647
a coward's way out?

306
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,610
Oh, you're right! I'm a coward!
(sobs)

307
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,363
I made such a mess of things!
(sobs)

308
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,158
If only there was some magic potion

309
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,118
that would make those crops grow.

310
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,745
Wait a minute.

311
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,539
(ringing)

312
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,665
Plutonium?

313
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,793
Gee, Homer, isn't that kind of risky?

314
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,045
Yeah, I guess you're right. It's not.

315
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,050
Hey, Lenny,
sending some outgoing mail?

316
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,218
You know it.

317
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,844
I'll probably send some tomorrow.

318
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,221
I hear that.

319
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,817
Easy.

320
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,693
Careful.

321
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,778
Steady.

322
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,200
Mmm... Hmm.

323
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,497
Time to give mother nature
a little goose.

324
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,040
HOMER: Well, Marge...

325
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,209
have you ever seen
a field glow like that?

326
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,086
It's eerily beautiful.

327
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,004
But are you sure this is safe?

328
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,966
Of course, not!
But you know something?

329
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,260
"Sometimes you have to break the rules

330
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,886
to free your heart."

331
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,305
You got that from a movie poster.

332
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,057
Well, "When there's nothing left

333
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,560
to believe in, believe in hope."

334
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,602
Where'd you get that?

335
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,856
From the producers of <i>Waiting to Exhale.</i>

336
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,108
Is that Plutonium on your gums?

337
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,359
Shut up and kiss me.

338
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,653
-Mmmmwah!
-Mmm!

339
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,783
(crowing)

340
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,951
Wake up, honey.

341
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,872
It's time to harvest
our radioactive super-crop.

342
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,582
But it's only been one night.

343
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,208
That's all it takes.

344
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,585
If we learned one thing

345
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,254
from <i>The Amazing Colossal Man</i>
and <i>Grasshopper-us,</i>

346
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:44,508
it's that radiation makes stuff
grow real big real fast.

347
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,803
But didn't <i>Grasshopper-us</i>
kill Chad Everett?

348
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,555
Only 'cause he tried to reason with him.

349
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,556
Oh.

350
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,391
Brace yourselves, everybody.

351
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,935
You're about to see the hugest, juiciest,

352
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,730
possibly super-intelligent vegetables

353
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,148
man has ever known.

354
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,065
You might want to crane

355
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,026
your necks upward now to save time.

356
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,861
Ta-da!

357
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,073
(wind whistling)

358
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,325
All right now, don't panic.

359
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,577
It's possible the giant
vegetables are invisible.

360
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,245
(excited gasping)

361
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,334
Oh! Where are you?
(yelps)

362
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,710
Oh, honey, give it up.

363
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,253
Oh, you're right.

364
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,630
This farm's hopeless.

365
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,590
Why didn't I listen
to those inbred hicks?

366
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,009
I guess I'll just go
hang myself in the barn.

367
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,010
Homer, no!

368
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,345
Let him go, Mom.

369
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,804
Wait, Dad!
You don't have to kill yourself.

370
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:31,931
This better be good.

371
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,808
Something is growing.

372
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,352
(gasps) A sprout!

373
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,437
And there's some more!

374
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,647
What is it? Carrots? Peas?

375
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,065
(gasps)
Maybe it's okra!

376
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,025
Who cares what it is? It's growing.

377
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,527
I've saved the farm! Yeah! Oh!

378
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,413
Look at my babies.

379
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,458
This tomato will be Heinz ketchup.

380
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:03,087
And this tomato will be Hunt's catsup.

381
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,632
(gags, coughs)

382
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,467
Tastes like cigarette butts!

383
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,094
Hmm. That's odd.

384
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,929
The outside looks like a tomato

385
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,639
but the inside is brown.

386
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,516
Maybe the tomato seeds crossbred

387
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,226
with the tobacco seeds.

388
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,978
Oh, great. I got a field full of mutants.

389
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,397
Gimme! I want more!

390
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,606
Mmm!

391
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,316
I thought you said it tasted terrible.

392
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,317
It does...

393
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,569
But it's smooth and mild.

394
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,074
And refreshingly addictive.
Mmm, mmm!

395
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,617
Addictive, eh?

396
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,330
"Tomacco"?
That's pretty clever, Dad.

397
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,000
I mean, for a product
that's evil and deadly.

398
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,459
Aw, thanks, honey.

399
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,170
I'm not crazy about
the plutonium or nicotine.

400
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,674
But it is very nice to see
Bart eating his vegetables.

401
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,592
Mmm, mmm.

402
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,263
Excuse me, Mr. Farmer Man.

403
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,641
I promised my son he could
tip over his first cow.

404
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,643
And I... "Tomacco"?

405
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:03,522
Yes, it's the latest craze.
Try some, won't you?

406
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:04,732
Go ahead, Ralphie.

407
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,942
The stranger is offering you a treat.

408
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:07,860
Mmm.

409
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,739
Oh, Daddy!
This tastes like Grandma!

410
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,702
Holy Moses!
It does taste like Grandma!

411
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,454
-I want more!
-Yeah, me too.

412
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,581
We'll take a bushel or a pack
or just give it to me!

413
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,292
(chuckles)

414
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,334
Yech!

415
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:25,836
(groans)

416
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,380
Can I interest you
in a mincemeat pie?

417
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,049
-They're very--
-Does it have Tomacco in it?

418
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,633
-No, but I use only the--
-Pass!

419
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,802
-I was here first.
-Come on, come on, people!

420
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,056
Don't push. There's plenty
of Tomacco for everyone.

421
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,974
Have your cash
or food stamps ready.

422
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,893
Don't forget your mincemeat pie.

423
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,853
You're scaring the customers, honey.

424
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,983
Hello, folks.

425
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,110
Would you and your family
like to take a ride with us?

426
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,028
OK.

427
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,781
Meet the Laramie cigarette team.

428
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,909
This is Mindy, J.P. and Emil.

429
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,369
Homer, we're in a bit of a pickle.

430
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,789
Kids are crazy about tobacco

431
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,665
but the politicians
won't let us sell it to them.

432
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,001
-Those dirty, rotten--
-Tell me about it.

433
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,004
But there's no law against
selling kids Tomacco.

434
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,006
That little "M" is worth
a lot of money to us

435
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,924
and to you.

436
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,008
How much?

437
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,301
Well, let's say a hundred...

438
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,636
-and 50...
-(gasps)

439
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,553
...million dollars.

440
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,806
One hundred and...

441
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,224
May I speak to my
family for a moment?

442
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,308
(lock clicks)

443
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,770
Did you see the way
Emil's looking at Mindy?

444
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,939
Hoo-hoo! I think
something's going on there.

445
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:30,150
Shouldn't we be talking about
the $150 million offer?

446
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,401
Oh, yeah. Let's take it.

447
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,112
Dad, it's a tobacco company!

448
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,655
They make billions off the suffering

449
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:35,739
and deaths of others.

450
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,907
She's right, Dad.

451
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,659
-They can afford a lot more.
-No!

452
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,411
I'm with Lisa.
Let's take 'em to the cleaners.

453
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,331
We all agree that 150 million
is an insult.

454
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,376
The least we can accept
is 150 billion!

455
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,335
(tires screehing)

456
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,423
They'll be back.

457
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,051
We control the world's
supply of Tomacco

458
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,636
and no one can
take that away from...

459
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,679
(shrieks)

460
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,805
(animals lowing, bleating)

461
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,056
Stop eating our future!

462
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,560
Get the... get outta...
bad animals! Go home!

463
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,103
Thank God. There's one left.

464
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,563
(grunting) You...

465
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,108
-(grunting)
-(lowing)

466
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,110
-Look! A flying saucer!
-Hmm?

467
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,153
(laughing)

468
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,154
Hmm.

469
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,824
There, there.
We had quite a scare today.

470
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,034
But you're gonna make us millions.

471
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,202
Yes, you are!

472
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,955
You're about to launch
a terrible evil on the world!

473
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,498
You've gotta destroy this plant!

474
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,708
I know, honey.

475
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,335
But what can I do as an individual?

476
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,753
I wouldn't know where to begin.

477
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,339
Just burn that plant right now
and end this madness!

478
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,633
I wish I could make a difference, Lisa.

479
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:37,843
But I'm just one man!

480
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,512
-(groans)
-I agree. But how?

481
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,763
(screams)

482
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,807
(bleating)

483
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,350
(bleating)

484
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,268
(neighing)

485
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,603
They're after the Tomacco!

486
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,068
Now you can't tell me
Nicotine's not addictive!

487
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,196
Lisa, there's absolutely
no evidence--

488
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,238
(lowing)

489
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,783
Tomacco!

490
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,994
(yelping)

491
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,622
(trumpeting)

492
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,415
(all screaming)

493
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,167
Give them the plant, Homer!

494
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,377
No. I'd rather die!

495
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,588
-(screeches)
-Aah! Take it!

496
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,678
Well, what a lovely gift. Gotta run.

497
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,555
So, Mindy...

498
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,099
How did you want to pay me
the 150 million?

499
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,102
Cash'll be OK. Or stock!

500
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,812
Does your company have stock?

501
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,773
Mindy!

502
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,024
Mindy and I are just hammering out

503
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,317
a payment plan.

504
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,527
We'll talk Monday!

505
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:41,156
Hey, props to Mindy
on the grab! Boo-ya!

506
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,784
Guys, we seem to be carrying
a little extra weight.

507
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:47,371
(chuckles) Don't look at me.
I'm on sugar busters.

508
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,330
(snarling)

509
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,915
(passengers screaming)

510
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,502
(bleating)

511
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,006
I've never been so glad to be home.

512
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,676
I don't know why we ever
left in the first place.

513
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:01,969
D'oh!

514
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,179
COLONEL: Five, six, seven...

515
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,180
(whimpering)

516
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,306
Eight... I say, eight...

517
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,811
Nine and 10.
(sniffing)

518
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,230
What is that intoxicatin' aroma?

519
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,525
Could that be... I say,
could that be mincemeat pie?

520
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,859
It certainly is.

521
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,487
Why don't you put down
your gun and have a slice?

522
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,281
Ah, don't mind if I do.

523
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,282
HOMER: Hey!

524
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,825
Are we duelin'or what?

525
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,743
Oh, where are my manners?

526
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,453
(screaming)

527
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,790
You OK, Dad?

528
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:32,874
I think so.

529
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,751
The bone stopped the bullet.

530
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,920
Dad, this might be
one of those things

531
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,130
you should go to the hospital for.

532
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,298
After pie.

533
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:48,223
WOMAN (singing): <i>♪ Glove slap</i>
<i>shut your big yap ♪</i>

534
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,435
<i>♪ Glove slap baby, glove slap ♪</i>

535
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:55,188
MAN (singing): <i>♪ Ooh, glove baby</i>
