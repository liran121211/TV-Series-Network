1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,002
(theme music playing)

2
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:06,589
CHORUS: <i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

3
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,935
(bell ringing)

4
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,108
(whistle blows)

5
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,364
(beeping)

6
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,871
(playing the blues)

7
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,414
(jazzy solo)

8
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,548
(chimes)

9
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,054
(tires screeching)

10
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,893
(honking horn)

11
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,523
D'oh!

12
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,608
(screams)

13
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,901
(tires screeching)

14
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,125
(children laughing)

15
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,128
Whee!

16
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,213
Catch!

17
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,673
Principal Skinner, what would you say

18
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,342
is the most important firefighting tool?

19
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,468
Would you say it's prevention?

20
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,303
Oh, absolutely, Lisa.

21
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,888
That and the sand bucket.

22
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:37,889
What's that stuff?

23
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,641
Why, this is retardant.

24
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,309
(laughing) Sure is.

25
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,227
And what's that?

26
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,895
That's called a hose lengthener.

27
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,730
(laughing) You need one.

28
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,315
-SKINNER: Oh.
-What's this?

29
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,859
Just read the label.
It's a king-sized flamer!

30
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,611
(laughing hysterically)

31
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,113
Bart, will you go bother someone else?

32
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,115
Look! A fire... engine.

33
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,199
Stop that!

34
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,576
Help! Help! Fire... Helmets.

35
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,453
Can't you do something constructive?

36
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,914
Sure, I can do something destructive.

37
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,541
(groaning)

38
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,625
Just say the word,

39
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,669
and I'll drive this hoe in his back!

40
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,629
I can make it look like suicide.

41
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:13,174
Hmm. And I want a bike, and a monkey,

42
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,301
and a friend for the monkey--

43
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,221
You're not gonna start any fires, are you?

44
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,682
At my house, we call 'em "uh-ohs."

45
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:24,018
Hi, fire doggie. Can you do any tricks?

46
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,645
Tricks? That's rich.

47
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,689
He's so inbred, he can barely stand up.

48
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,274
(whimpers)

49
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,067
Fire can be our servant

50
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,945
Whether it's toasting s'mores
or raining down on Charlie.

51
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,990
But it can turn not so nice,
as you'll see in this skit...

52
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,576
by the volunteer fire department players.

53
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,952
(scattered applause)

54
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,036
(chuckles)

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,705
What a great pot party!

56
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,540
Wasn't it, man?

57
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,626
Now for a regular cigarette
to make the night complete.

58
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,504
(coughs) Oh!

59
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,381
(chuckles) Man, that's good.

60
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,175
Mad Dog, I've been thinking...

61
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,010
Maybe we should get another smoke detector

62
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,970
in case that one trips out on us.

63
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,222
(chuckling) Why bother, baby?

64
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,600
One smoke detector's enough for Mad Dog.

65
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,351
Now, let's hit the sack.

66
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,064
(exhales, snores)

67
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,861
Whoa! Check it out! Mad Dog's on fire!

68
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,613
Stop, drop and roll, man!

69
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,490
(chuckling) That's for Clydes, baby.

70
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,618
A little fire can't hurt you.

71
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,411
But Mad Dog was wrong.

72
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,330
The fire burned through the night

73
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,540
and cost him the use of his pants.

74
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,584
-Which just goes to show you--
-Huh?

75
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,793
-(gasps)
-Sorry to break character...

76
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,794
but these stunt pants

77
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:32,879
are gettin' pretty toasty!

78
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,547
Ah. Roll, Neddie! Roll!

79
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,883
(laughter)

80
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,968
It's not workin'!
It just spreads the flame!

81
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,054
Get the fire hose. Get the fire hose!

82
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,392
What's it doing in the gymnasium?

83
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,145
Yee-haw!

84
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,814
Bart, have you lost your-- (yells)

85
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,858
(both yelling)

86
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,360
(yelling)

87
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,865
(groans, sputters)

88
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,536
(laughing hysterically)

89
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,788
Bart Simpson!

90
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,998
You've really done it this time.

91
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,084
Yeah. It all kind of came together.

92
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,381
(squeaking)

93
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,675
(grunting)

94
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,386
(sighs)

95
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,012
(grunts)

96
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,180
Thank you for coming.

97
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,932
Thank you for getting me out of work.

98
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,226
I'll be blunt. Bart's latest escapade goes

99
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,019
far beyond the realm of the high jink.

100
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,398
There. Now the floor is as good as new.

101
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,444
(groans) My sport goggles!

102
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,071
Your son is a ravenous demon,

103
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,949
relentlessly gnawing at all
that's good and true.

104
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,826
(chuckles) Yeah, he's something else,
all right.

105
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:45,910
But worst of all,

106
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,203
he drags down the grades

107
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,621
of anyone who sits near him.

108
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,956
Just look at this pattern.

109
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,624
HOMER: Hey, that looks like Bart.

110
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,876
And turning to the 3-D map,

111
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,547
we see an unmistakable cone of ignorance.

112
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,424
Put it away! Put it away!

113
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,634
Very well. But there's
no escaping the truth.

114
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,512
Bart has a classic case
of attention deficit disorder.

115
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,389
You mean like John Leguizamo?

116
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,765
How should I know? The point is

117
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,352
ADD makes children restless
and easily distracted.

118
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,271
Hi, Marge. It's me, Homer.

119
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,314
(clears throat)

120
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,398
What? Time to go?

121
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,774
Please, Mr. Simpson.

122
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,152
-I'm afraid I'll have to expel your son--
-(gasps)

123
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,903
Unless you're willing to try a radical,

124
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,613
untested, potentially dangerous--

125
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,906
-Candy bar?
-No!

126
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,992
It's a new drug called Focusyn.

127
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,702
A drug?

128
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,412
I know Bart can be rambunctious,

129
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,372
but he's not some hyperactive monster.

130
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,749
BART: Gimme an "F"!

131
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,542
-(gasps) Good lord!
-Gimme an "art"!

132
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,377
He's gotten into the pep closet.

133
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,296
I'd say he's coming out of the pep closet.

134
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,006
(chuckles)

135
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,765
I don't want to pump
my little boy full of drugs.

136
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,308
Yeah, yeah, we get a lot of that.

137
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,101
But then they see our results.

138
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,355
These are normal guinea pigs
running around like idiots.

139
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,606
(all squealing)

140
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,524
Now I'll give them some Focusyn.

141
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,865
(gasps) That's amazing...

142
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,408
and darling.

143
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,826
Check this out.

144
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,996
(soft squealing)

145
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,539
They become your slaves.

146
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,582
Yes.

147
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,125
But it's not about slavery.

148
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,960
It's about helping kids concentrate.

149
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,005
This pill reduces class clownism 44%...

150
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,132
With 60% less sass mouth.

151
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,343
The only thing more effective
is regular exercise.

152
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,344
(shudders)

153
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,845
(Bart grunting)

154
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,724
<i>-Shred it! Shred it!</i>
-(indistinct shouting)

155
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,393
<i>Extra gloves. Extra gloves.</i>

156
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,519
<i>Mushroom bonus. Reload.</i>

157
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,979
(groans) How will we get
Bart to take these?

158
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,232
It's all about trust, honey.

159
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,694
Ow! Knock it off!.

160
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:48,074
Homer, we agreed we'd discuss
the medication with Bart.

161
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,534
Medication?

162
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,327
Some special helpers

163
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,704
that'll make you a good boy.

164
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,289
I don't want to take drugs.

165
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,457
Sure you do.

166
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,835
All your favorite stars have used drugs.

167
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,837
Brett Butler, Tim Allen--

168
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,630
-Tommy Lee.
-Andy Dick.

169
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,133
-He's just flamboyant.
-Yeah, and I'm a size four.

170
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,635
Dad, I admit I have some problems,

171
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,554
but drugs aren't the answer.

172
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,305
-Why, you little--
-(screaming)

173
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,306
-(grunts)
-Oh.

174
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,394
Son, let's forget
all about that drug thing.

175
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:19,730
Why don't you just come down
and have some taffy?

176
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,773
Nice try, Homer.

177
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,816
Just take one bite.

178
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,568
If you're not 100% different--

179
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,611
Ow! Geez, what's the big deal?

180
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,946
Look, I'll even eat some.

181
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,116
Now-- Hmm?

182
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,035
(gibberish)

183
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,916
Does Mr. Simpson have a demon, Daddy?

184
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,502
Looks like it. Run and get
Daddy's exorcism tongs.

185
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,628
-Yay!
-Yay!

186
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,672
(gibberish continues)

187
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,216
Honey, if you don't want
to take the medicine,

188
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,384
we won't force you.

189
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,719
Really?

190
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,015
Yes, I just thought
you might love me enough

191
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,475
to let me help you.

192
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,769
Oh, Mom!

193
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,356
All right. I'll do it for you.

194
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,441
(gulps)

195
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,984
Way to guilt him, Marge.

196
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,360
It's what I do.

197
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,865
(gibberish)

198
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,622
Good morning, honey.

199
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,583
Mmm! How's my special little guy?

200
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,084
I'm having some side effects
from the dope.

201
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,085
It's not dope!

202
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,129
It's something to help you concentrate.

203
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,216
All I know is my testicles
won't fit in my underwear.

204
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,092
Bart, get those oranges out of there.

205
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,011
(laughing)

206
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,304
Back in the lunches you go.

207
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,805
Ew, Mom!

208
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,682
-Oh, grow up.
-Yeah.

209
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,020
I have to take these
stupid pills twice a day.

210
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,855
I'll trade you a Claritin for one.

211
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,065
Claritin-D?

212
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,067
-Nah.
-Can't help you.

213
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,693
I take hormones to lower my voice.

214
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,904
Now all I want to do is fight.

215
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,364
What are you lookin' at?

216
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,907
You think you got it bad?

217
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,492
I gotta wear a shock collar.

218
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,160
-Ooh!
-That's rough.

219
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,371
-(screams)
-What was that for?

220
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,540
I thought about a girl I like.

221
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,375
All right, class, who would like to read

222
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,835
-<i>The Daffodils </i>by Wordsworth?
-I'll do it.

223
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,755
No, thank you, Mr. Wisenheimer. Sherri?

224
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,174
"I wandered lonely as a cloud...

225
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,677
that floats on high
o'er vales and hills--"

226
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,679
Hey, look at those dogs going at it!

227
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,305
I want to see 'em! I wanna see 'em!

228
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,224
Fightin' over a fan belt.

229
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,518
Dogs are outstanding.

230
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,396
All right, people, we've
all seen the dogs now,

231
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,605
so-- (gasps)

232
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,399
-What?
-You're still in your seat.

233
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,818
Well, it's not like
I never saw a dog before.

234
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,695
(thinking) <i>That doesn't sound like me.</i>

235
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,321
<i>Could it be the drug kicking in?</i>

236
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,699
<i>I am feeling an urge</i>
<i>to straighten up and fly right.</i>

237
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:39,120
Come on, people. This poetry
isn't gonna appreciate itself.

238
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,080
(applause on TV)

239
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,749
<i>What a lovely day in the park.</i>

240
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,752
A perfect place to meet a lady.

241
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,384
Ooh, la, la! It's sideshow Melanie!

242
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,638
-(laughter)
-Hey, what's goin' on?

243
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,224
Hey, this thing's cuttin' off my air!

244
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,351
(laughter)

245
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,312
(grunting)

246
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,563
Oh!

247
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,689
What are you doing to me?

248
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,733
I said start it at 60 rpm.

249
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,277
Then move it up to 100 on the skirt blow!

250
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,612
Sorry, Krusty, I choked.

251
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,614
-You choked? You choked?
-Ahh!

252
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,073
Bart! Bart!

253
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,284
Krusty just fired his associate producer.

254
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,493
I'm reading.

255
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,579
No way.

256
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,749
"The 7 Habits Of
Highly Effective Pre-Teens"?

257
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:28,002
Is this all because of the--
(gulps, groans)

258
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,754
Joke if you will, but did you know

259
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,964
most people use 10% of their brains?

260
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,841
I am now one of them.

261
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,843
Before, my energy was all over the place.

262
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,346
Now, it's concentrated like a laser beam.

263
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,265
Well, this has been terrific.
Let's do it again sometime.

264
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,850
Are you standing up to get me to leave?

265
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,226
It's from the book.

266
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,437
Hey, I'm not a time burglar.

267
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,981
"Memo to self... Lock door."

268
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,316
All right, I'll go.

269
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,151
You don't have to be a jerk about it.

270
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,196
"Memo to self... Shut up, Lisa."

271
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,280
(shouts)

272
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,825
Hmm.

273
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,828
"Thank you in advance
for a world-class meal.

274
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,831
You're an inspiration
to our entire organization.

275
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,500
Thank you again. Bart."

276
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,919
Oh, what a lovely gesture.

277
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,339
Cost of paper, five cents.
A mother's love, priceless.

278
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,340
Aw...

279
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,466
-Do I get a card?
-No,

280
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,301
but here's a book called
<i>Chicken Soup for the Loser</i>

281
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,302
that gave Bill Buckner the courage

282
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,012
to open a chain of laundromats.

283
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,516
Hmm. My career has kind of lost momentum.

284
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,768
I think it's the bright blue pants.

285
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,895
I mean, (scoffs) you're not
on a golf course.

286
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,773
Well, I have been thinking
about making them into cutoffs.

287
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,692
(crow caws)

288
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,318
I tell you, the kid's a wonder.

289
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,946
He organized all the lawsuits against me

290
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,948
into one class action.

291
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,117
That's gonna save
all kinds of travel time.

292
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,994
You know it. Plus, he gave me
this appointment dealy.

293
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,579
It's got my whole week in there.

294
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,872
-(Lenny whistles)
-CARL: Sweet.

295
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,749
This thing'll do anything. Watch.

296
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,377
I'll ask it how many leagues
in a furlong. No, wait.

297
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,213
I'll make it say, "what's
a-matter, you?" in Turkish.

298
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,840
(computerized voice
speaking foreign language)

299
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,300
And look at this! A cheese grater!

300
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,678
Man, technology's amazing.

301
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,264
A guy could do great things
with a gadget like that.

302
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,473
Well, if you want one, they sell 'em at--

303
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,851
Yeah, a guy could do great things.

304
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,728
(slurping)

305
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,733
The boy's still studying?

306
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,234
Can you believe it?

307
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,237
And he's even tutoring
a little Navajo boy.

308
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,990
And why did Humpty Dumpty
have a great fall?

309
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,993
Because he took his eyes off the prize?

310
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,411
That's right. You stay on the ball,

311
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,579
you stay on the wall.

312
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,748
He's gone from goofus to gallant.

313
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,834
And we owe it all to mind-bending pills.

314
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:32,877
Mwah.

315
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,045
Bart's so well-behaved now.

316
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,089
Maybe you and I can have a night out.

317
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,966
Ooh! Let's go to the water park!

318
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,760
My 10-year ban ended yesterday.

319
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:45,222
I was thinking of something
a little more... adult.

320
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,307
(whispering)

321
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,017
Oh, Marge!

322
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,686
And then afterwards--
(whispering continues)

323
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,188
(giggles) Really?

324
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,773
With butterscotch on it?

325
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,566
I think you misheard me.

326
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,279
You've got more talent than
any dancer I've ever seen,

327
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,198
And you're throwing it all away!

328
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,366
Screw you! Screw everybody!

329
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,578
All right, girls, tops off. It's showtime!

330
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,288
(moans)

331
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,915
Marge, this is the greatest gift

332
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,000
any wife has ever given her husband.

333
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,210
I thought you'd like it.

334
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,628
And I'm enjoying the friendship

335
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,755
between showgirl and that seamstress.

336
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,757
-Pipe down!
-Yes. Hush up.

337
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,675
-You hush up!
-Quiet, everybody!

338
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,886
Shut up, or I'll pound all of ya!

339
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,137
(yells)

340
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,431
That was fun!

341
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,849
We have to get out more often.

342
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,017
I heard about a new bar

343
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,602
where men dance with men.

344
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,103
Doesn't that sound adorable?

345
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,314
Well, sure, if it's true.

346
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,316
(gasps) Is that Lisa?

347
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,156
I'm so glad you're here.
Bart's really acting funny.

348
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,741
Ray J. funny, or O.J. funny?

349
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,742
LISA: You'll see.

350
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,911
(Bart muttering incoherently)
Gotta get it done.

351
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,663
Bart? Honey?

352
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,415
Gotta finish. (grunting)

353
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,001
-Close the door.
-(door closes)

354
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,254
You're probably wondering
about the coat hangers.

355
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,421
They're to block the satellite

356
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,881
that's been spying on me.

357
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,716
OK.

358
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,511
It can read your electronic
organizer from space.

359
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,555
-Even mine?
-(grunting)

360
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,473
Hey, I had Lenny's name on that!

361
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,475
They have it now.

362
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,686
And who are they, exactly?

363
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,729
Who else? Major League Baseball.

364
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,191
Marge, I think Bart's gone crazy.

365
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,569
Oh, Bart, what's happened to you?

366
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,196
Nothing yet. But the time draws near.

367
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,115
Now, let's get those fillings out of you!

368
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,283
(screaming)

369
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,618
Hey, you found my needle-nose pliers.

370
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,540
I understand the electrodes,

371
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,292
but why does he have to be on a treadmill?

372
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,377
Oh, that was his idea.
He said he felt fat.

373
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,295
Oh.

374
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,422
You said he was concerned
about satellites?

375
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,133
-And their beams.
-Any other strange behavior?

376
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,635
He quit blinking. He says
that's when they get you.

377
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,845
I had a feeling this might happen.

378
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:48,929
This Carboxyl group

379
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,347
sometimes causes problems.

380
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,266
After we trusted you!

381
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,809
(grunting)

382
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,811
I think we should take him off the drug.

383
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,187
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

384
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,148
You can't just "go off" Focusyn.

385
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,775
But we can ease Bart
onto one of its sister drugs

386
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,235
like Chlorhexinol,

387
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,029
and augment that with some Phenolbutamine.

388
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,197
Hmm, and maybe some Cyclobenzanone?

389
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,700
That's a great idea!

390
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,076
(grunts) No!

391
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,494
You can't take my Focusyn.

392
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,913
I need every brain cell

393
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,664
blazing to outwit my invisible enemies.

394
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,541
I know you love Focusyn, son,

395
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,918
but in time you'll get

396
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,253
just as attached to these three amigos.

397
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,964
No!

398
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,009
(chomping)

399
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,178
(gasps)

400
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,473
-(grunts)
-Uh-oh!

401
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,309
Somebody's gonna have a tummy ache.

402
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,020
Stop him! He's whacked out of his gourd!

403
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,814
Don't worry. We have a procedure
for these situations.

404
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,321
Ahh!

405
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,615
Hey, there was just air in mine.

406
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,575
(groaning)

407
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,789
And I'm really worried, Chief.

408
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,457
There's no telling what he might do.

409
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,834
OK, so you say your son is towheaded,

410
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,836
button nose, mischievous smile,

411
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,546
and maybe armed with a slingshot?

412
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,590
Got it. We'll find him, ma'am.

413
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,636
Hey, looks like the kid who
roughed up the Wilson widow.

414
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,263
Oh, my little guy's
out there in the hot sun

415
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,723
without his sombrero.

416
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,016
We should've paid more attention

417
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,434
to these side effects.

418
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,353
It's all here-- Erratic behavior,

419
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,938
paranoia, diarrhea-

420
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,481
I don't think he has diarrhea.

421
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,401
But how do we know, Marge? How do we know?

422
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,075
I can't believe that sarge said

423
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,868
we're the worst bunch he's ever seen.

424
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,870
See, I have to believe he's
seen worse bunches than us.

425
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,872
-But he said--
-I know what he said.

426
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,165
He was just trying to motivate us.

427
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,709
Well, it ruined the whole hike.

428
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,253
(sinister chuckle)

429
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,880
(demented laughter)

430
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,174
MAN 1: Do you think Alex would mind
if I asked Janet out?

431
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,843
MAN 2: They're married, idiot!

432
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,012
MAN 1: Why'd you have to yell?
You ruined the whole shower.

433
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,850
So I gave up tap for jazz,
and I've never regretted it.

434
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:58,934
And here's why.

435
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,185
Homer, you're supposed

436
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,812
to be hunting for Bart.

437
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,230
I'm on top of it.

438
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,776
(groans) My sweet baby.

439
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,571
He must feel so helpless and scared.

440
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:15,034
<i>♪ Don't stop thinking about tomorrow ♪</i>

441
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,537
<i>♪ Don't stop, it'll soon be here ♪</i>

442
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,913
(all screaming)

443
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,498
Smithers, we're at war!

444
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,875
I'll begin profiteering, Sir.

445
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,419
And hoarding. Leave it to the democrats

446
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,212
to let the Spaniards back in the pantry.

447
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:35,179
Egad! A maniac cutting
a swath of destruction!

448
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,222
This is a job for the Green Lantern,

449
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,809
Thundra or possibly... Ghost Rider.

450
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,102
What about Superman?

451
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,187
Oh, please.

452
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,733
What the-- Hmm?

453
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,776
Uh...

454
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,319
Come on! Get out!

455
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,738
Noodles, Seesaw, Oopsie, Lobsweat, Hoohah,

456
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,364
Jitters, Sir Widebottom!

457
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,325
-Oh. I'm stuck.
-(creaking)

458
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,118
-Easy, boys. My bum.
-(all straining)

459
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,208
I'm sure I'm alive, but why?

460
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,460
(screaming)

461
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,296
(cheering)

462
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,757
You've raised the bar
for all of us, Simpson,

463
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,758
and I thank you.

464
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,344
-Wow. Praise from Caesar.
-Huh?

465
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,930
(siren wailing)

466
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,681
Shoot the tires out, Lou.

467
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,433
Uh, it's a tank, Chief.

468
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,186
You know what? I'm gettin'
real tired of your excuses.

469
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,399
(chattering)

470
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,487
What a day! First, the drinking fountain
squirts me, and now this.

471
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,205
My God, is she brave,

472
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,874
standing up to that freaked-out junkie.

473
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,168
Dad, that junkie is your son.

474
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,045
Why don't you just tell everybody?

475
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,672
Hey, Mom. Thanks for coming out.

476
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,424
Oh, thank you for stopping the tank.

477
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,510
-It ran out of gas.
-Oh.

478
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,345
-So, Bart--
-Question.

479
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,431
How about getting out of the tank, huh?

480
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,017
Maybe stopping your rampage, huh?

481
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,310
We could go to Krusty Burger.

482
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,104
-OK, sure.
-Whew!

483
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,606
Right after I blow up one thing.

484
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,816
(groans)

485
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,071
(gasps) Good lord! He's going to fire!

486
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,366
All right! Scud the school, dude!

487
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,618
No, stop. Think of the children.

488
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,790
(all gasping)

489
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,170
Not the church! Jesus lives there!

490
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,674
The frame store? You monster!

491
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:41,096
Not the sky! That's where clouds are born!

492
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,768
(all gasping)

493
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,523
(siren wailing)

494
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,193
A satellite? What do we do? What do we do?

495
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,404
"Discotheques, frat houses, Malibu--"

496
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,822
Nothing about satellite fires.

497
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,325
Let's just spray it with water already.

498
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,495
That's the end of your
loony tune, drugs Bunny.

499
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,207
You're under arrest for astro-vandalism.

500
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,791
And may god help you if that thing carried

501
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,959
the Spice Channel!

502
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,005
"Major League Baseball"?

503
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,008
I told you they were
monitoring my activities.

504
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,886
He's right! This thing's got
info on everybody.

505
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,638
Addresses, credit ratings,

506
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,306
what size baseball hat they wear.

507
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,808
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
<i>Surveillance beam disabled.</i>

508
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,520
<i>Market research shutting down.</i>
<i>Doesn't that beat all?</i>

509
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,776
-Hi, folks. I'm Mark McGwire.
-(all gasping)

510
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,278
COMPUTERIZED VOICE: <i>Big Mac himself.</i>
<i>Who'd have thunk it?</i>

511
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,488
Young Bart here was right.

512
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,572
We are spying on you

513
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,907
pretty much around the clock.

514
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,492
But why, Mr. McGwire?

515
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,619
Do you want to know
the terrifying truth...

516
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,871
or do you wanna see me sock a few dingers?

517
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,415
ALL: Dingers! Dingers!

518
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,876
-(grunts)
-ALL: Ooh!

519
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,961
Yoink!

520
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,384
Ah!

521
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,344
It's good to have the old Bart back.

522
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,597
Plus, you exposed the disturbing
unreadiness of today's army.

523
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,099
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry

524
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,393
we sent you on that psychotropic hayride.

525
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,520
At least I got to see some cool colors.

526
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,606
And Mark McGwire gave
you an autographed bat.

527
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,150
Why is the zero made out of glass?

528
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,404
<i>Who cares? That man can really slug.</i>

529
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,740
Well, I'm not giving my baby
any more dangerous drugs.

530
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,951
From now on, it's nothing but fresh air,

531
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,329
lots of hugs,
and good old-fashioned Ritalin.

532
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,707
You said a mouthful.

533
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,002
<i>♪ When I can't stop fiddlin'</i>
<i>I just takes me Ritalin ♪</i>

534
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,671
<i>♪ I'm poppin' and sailin', man ♪</i>

535
