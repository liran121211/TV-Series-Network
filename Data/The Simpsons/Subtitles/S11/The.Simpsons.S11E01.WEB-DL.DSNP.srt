00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,654
My children deserve to see me

26
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,114
get a free gift.

27
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,283
I'm proud of you, Dad.

28
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,911
Buying an electric car
will help clean the air up

29
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,371
and protect the earth's supply--

30
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,373
You're faking this
to get the gift, aren't you?

31
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,708
But I like the nice things
you said about me.

32
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,877
Thinking of saying good-bye to gas?

33
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,629
You betcha. (burps)

34
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,005
Bart! (farts)

35
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,507
Well, that shut me up.

36
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,426
Hello. I, uh, love your planet deeply

37
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,220
and I'm interested in purchasing

38
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,930
one of your electronic autos.

39
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,473
(snickering)

40
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,892
Well, it's always nice to meet people

41
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,519
concerned about the environment.

42
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,520
What kind of mint?

43
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,898
Boy, that quiet engine

44
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,442
sure makes conversation a lot easier.

45
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,028
Yeah, it's got
a lot of other problems, too.

46
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,489
Uh, Dad, you're headed for the harbor!

47
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,159
HOMER: Relax. We're in an electric car.

48
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,327
(screaming)

49
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,499
See, everything's fine.

50
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,792
(gasps) Dolphins.

51
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,669
Oopsie.

52
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,379
Hi, girls.

53
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,547
(screaming)

54
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,756
HOMER: Oh...

55
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,554
Saltwater seems to be good for it.

56
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:01,681
(Bart coughing)

57
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,434
(Homer humming)

58
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,351
Um, I'm sorry,

59
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,395
the car does not meet my eco-concern.

60
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,646
Can I have my prize now?

61
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,564
Certainly.

62
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,194
What the...

63
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,613
CAR COMPUTER: <i>Help! Help! It burns!</i>

64
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,909
Hey, we never opened that envelope

65
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,493
to see what our gift is.

66
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,536
We didn't?

67
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,537
That's odd.

68
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,788
Seems like we would have done that

69
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,415
right after we left the car place.

70
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,042
I know, but we didn't.

71
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,210
Well, here it is.

72
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,378
So we can open it and find out now.

73
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,421
Perfect.

74
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,174
Aw, movie tickets?

75
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,635
It hardly seems worth destroying a car.

76
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,595
They're passes to a test screening

77
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:41,930
of a new movie starring...

78
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:42,847
(gasps)

79
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,307
Mel Gibson.

80
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,225
Who else is in it?

81
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,101
Who cares? Mel Gibson.

82
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,895
Mel Gibson is just a guy, Marge.

83
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,438
No different than me or Lenny.

84
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,566
Were you or Lenny ever named
sexiest man alive?

85
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,068
Hmm, I'm not certain about Lenny.

86
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,029
Besides, it's not just
his chiseled good looks.

87
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,782
<i>People </i>magazine says
he's a devoted father,

88
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,325
goes to church every week,

89
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,743
and likes to fix things around the...

90
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,662
-Homer, let's make love.
-Uh, okay.

91
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:10,541
(smooching)

92
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,086
Uh, you're thinking about me, right?

93
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,796
Of course, Homie.

94
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,297
Aren't you thinking about me?

95
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,548
Well, I will now!

96
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,512
Easy, easy, there, buster.

97
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,639
But how did they know?

98
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,809
I had a mouse.

99
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,519
Thank you.

100
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,896
(clearing throat) Good evening.

101
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,939
I'm Edward Christian,

102
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,816
Assistant VP of finance and distribution

103
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,109
at Polystar Pictures.

104
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,070
(applause and cheers)

105
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,364
Dang, I should have brought the camera.

106
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,866
Also with me tonight are the dynamic duo,

107
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,368
William Milo and Robin Hannah

108
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,453
who green-lighted all
of Shaquille O'Neal's movies,

109
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,788
including <i>Kazaam</i>!

110
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,707
(all murmuring)

111
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,208
How's the popcorn, guys?

112
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,793
-Needs salt!
-Needs salt!

113
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,129
(all laughing)

114
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,426
Anyhoo, welcome to our test screening

115
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,220
of Mel Gibson's directorial
follow-up to <i>Braveheart</i>,

116
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,306
a remake of the Jimmy Stewart classic,

117
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,974
<i>Mr. Smith Goes To Washington.</i>

118
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,350
(applause and cheers)

119
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,477
I knew I shouldn't have passed on that.

120
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,854
Now, after the film,

121
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,565
I'll be handing out these cards
for your opinion.

122
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,150
We then take your cards

123
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,652
to Hollywood, California.

124
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,862
(all gasping)

125
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,323
...And change the movie
based on your suggestions.

126
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,407
Any, uh, questions?

127
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,616
Yes. Over here and thank you.

128
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,576
(clears throat) Hi. Will there be

129
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,286
any Flubber in this movie?

130
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,495
Uh-hi. Glayvin.

131
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,664
(laughs) No, I'm afraid not.

132
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,291
Ah, for cryin' out, Glayvin!

133
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,585
Is Mel Gibson here?

134
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,628
No, sorry, but like all celebrities,

135
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,673
he's in Hollywood attending
benefits for various diseases.

136
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,593
(applause and cheers)

137
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,182
-(gasping)
-Did they like it?

138
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,808
Well, they haven't seen it yet, Mel.

139
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,643
How'd you get here from LA so fast?

140
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,270
John Travolta flew me in his jet.

141
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,481
Now I have to help him move next weekend.

142
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,482
He deliberately waited

143
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,733
till we were in the air to ask me.

144
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,568
You know, you really didn't have
to make this trip, Mel.

145
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,737
The screening is going to go fine.
Believe me.

146
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,281
I don't know. I think this movie
was a big mistake.

147
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,699
All I do is talk for two hours.

148
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,493
I don't shoot anybody.
What was I thinking?

149
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,786
You shouldn't worry about the movie.

150
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,038
William and I both think it's fabulous.

151
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,539
And I think we know a little something

152
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,582
about the movie business.

153
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,626
(chuckles) Oh, Robin. You've got to see

154
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,919
the director's cut of <i>Booty Call</i>.

155
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,003
It's fabulous.

156
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,546
What, even better than the original?

157
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,923
'Cause that was pretty fabulous, too.

158
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,551
<i>...And he fought for them once.</i>

159
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,679
For the only reason any man ever does

160
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,891
because of one plain, simple rule:

161
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,935
Love thy neighbor.

162
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,770
Boring.

163
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,771
It's not boring.

164
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,981
He's passionate about government.

165
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,150
Pft. At least the Jimmy Stewart version

166
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,611
had that giant rabbit
who ran the savings and loan.

167
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,529
Shh!

168
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,114
(all murmuring)

169
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,115
Excellent.

170
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,700
That man knows how to filibuster.

171
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,619
Well, that was a stinker.

172
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,703
I liked it.

173
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,080
It was nice to see a movie

174
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,249
where people
solve their problems with words

175
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,334
instead of bullets and chasing.

176
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,335
Oh, you're just saying that

177
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,421
because your boyfriend was in it.

178
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,630
I'll bet you would have hated it

179
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,757
if me and Lenny were Mr. Smith.

180
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,926
Will you stop acting so jealous!

181
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,262
Listen, I don't want
to get spotted by the crowd,

182
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,055
so I'm going to take
a leak behind the dumpster.

183
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,391
(alarm ringing)

184
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,642
(all gasping)

185
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,144
Look! It's Mel Gibson.

186
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,687
Hey, everybody rush over there.

187
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,230
(all screaming)

188
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,816
WIGGUM: Hi, Mel. Hi.

189
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,192
Hi, Mel, Mel.

190
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:25,945
Hi, everybody.

191
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,155
(all gasp)

192
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,699
Hi, Mr. Gibson.

193
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,825
Thanks for coming, folks.

194
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,077
And don't be afraid
to be completely truthful

195
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,745
when you fill out your opinion cards.

196
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,039
Honesty is the foundation
of the movie business.

197
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,666
Oh, we'll be honest. (chuckles)

198
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,169
We could never lie to you, Mel. (chuckles)

199
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,879
Um, will you be reading

200
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,547
the cards yourself, Mel?

201
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,799
Well, I'll be reading yours personally.

202
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,176
(sexy growl)

203
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,677
-(panting)
-(all gasp)

204
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,596
(all laughing)

205
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,513
(grunts)

206
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,475
That's it. I'm telling
Mr. Stupidest man alive

207
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,809
what I really thought of his movie.

208
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,311
-Hey, Gibson!
-Uh, yes, sir.

209
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,146
-Got a pencil?
-There you go.

210
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,063
Thanks.

211
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,025
(muttering) You waste my time
in front of this stupid--

212
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,318
Appreciate it. (grunts)

213
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,861
(muttering)

214
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,781
The movie tested through the roof, Mel.

215
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,201
The sea captain gave it "Four Arrrrs."

216
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,161
Bumblebee man says, "<i>Muy bueno.</i>"

217
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,038
And we were worried about
the Latino market, huh?

218
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,623
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-Huh? Huh? Huh?

219
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,624
Worried.

220
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,083
Come on, they can't all have loved it.

221
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,919
"Loved it." "Loved it." "Loved it."

222
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,546
"Loved it despite absence
of Flubber, Glayvin"?

223
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,340
Oh, here we go. "Your movie

224
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,175
was more boring than church.

225
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,885
All you did was yak, yak, yak.

226
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,012
You didn't even shoot anybody."
Damn, I knew it!

227
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,597
Oh, don't do this to yourself, Mel.

228
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,224
The guy's obviously a nut.

229
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,100
Maybe. Or maybe he's the only person

230
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,852
with the guts to tell me the truth.

231
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,437
Turn the plane around.

232
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,940
I want to go to 742 Evergreen Terrace.

233
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,317
But you promised to help me move.

234
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,485
Oh, geez!

235
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,990
(aircraft approaching)

236
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,326
(loud rumbling)

237
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,994
-(doorbell ringing)
-Door, Marge.

238
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,120
(growls)

239
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,291
(gasps)

240
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,627
I'm looking for... Homer Simpson.

241
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,712
And I've been looking for you, too, pal.

242
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,797
Pound him, Dad.

243
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,839
Bart, don't.

244
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,425
Quiet. Dad's going to get
his butt kicked by Mel Gibson.

245
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,010
Knock his teeth out, Homer!

246
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,055
Listen, Gibson, I'm tired
of Hollywood pretty boys

247
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,558
like you and Jack Valenti

248
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,810
thinking you can have any woman you want.

249
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,894
You see this?

250
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,647
It symbolizes that she's my property

251
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,023
and I own her.

252
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,067
Mr. Simpson, I need your help.

253
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,985
Uh?

254
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,653
I think you're right about my movie,

255
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,905
and I want you to help me make it better.

256
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,824
Really? You want my help?

257
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,534
Marge, did you hear that?

258
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,411
Mel Gibson wants my help.

259
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,453
Mel Gibson.

260
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,788
But, Dad, I thought you hated...

261
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:41,956
Shut up.

262
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,542
Homer doesn't know anything
about making movies.

263
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,252
Don't sell your husband
short, Mrs. Simpson.

264
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,628
She's always doing that, Mel.

265
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,964
-Oh...
-Homer is a brutally honest man.

266
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,008
Completely tactless and insensitive.

267
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,759
(giggles) Guilty as charged.

268
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:54,677
The problem I have is

269
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,221
people love me so much,
they never criticize me.

270
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,932
I speed all the time,
but cops never give me a ticket.

271
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,392
If I don't pay my taxes,

272
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,977
the IRS pays them for me.

273
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,895
Oh, you poor thing.

274
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,188
It's hell being Mel.

275
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,399
(horn honking)

276
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,609
Come on. Geez.

277
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,985
I don't have much time, Homer.

278
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,486
Will you come to Hollywood with me?

279
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,031
(sniffs) You had me at "hello."

280
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,574
I didn't say "hello."

281
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,622
MARGE: Hollywood, here we come!

282
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,044
Hollywood, here we are!

283
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,378
LISA: Stop doing that, Mom.

284
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,133
A mini-van.

285
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,427
Oh, boy, you celebrities
sure know how to live.

286
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,429
What is this, Toyota Previa?

287
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,597
Dodge Caravan.

288
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,514
(whistles)

289
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,641
Sweet.

290
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,768
Look, they're making a movie!

291
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,728
Robert Downey Jr. is shooting it out

292
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,771
with the police.

293
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,690
I don't see any cameras.

294
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,067
Okay, while Mel and I are working,

295
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,610
why don't you guys do the town?

296
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,403
I hear all the stars eat at a place

297
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,656
called Planet Hollywood.

298
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,698
Can I stay with you, Dad?

299
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,493
Sorry, son, but we're going
to be very busy.

300
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,620
Mel's movie really stinks.

301
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,164
Okay, this opening scene

302
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,791
should be in fast motion.

303
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,876
Everybody likes that
'cause it looks funny.

304
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,378
(talking in fast motion)
Mr. Smith is coming to Washington.

305
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,046
He's really honest, that could be bad news
for us corrupt politicians.

306
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,422
-Well, if he is, big deal.
-How do you figure?

307
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,091
If he doesn't play ball, we'll teach him
a thing or two if you know what I mean.

308
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,342
-Bye-bye.
-See ya.

309
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,760
(laughing) Look at that.

310
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,678
I don't think so.

311
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,846
Okay, here you need a musical montage

312
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,140
where you try on lots of funny hats.

313
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,892
It'll let us see your playful side.

314
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,018
-No. Just no.
-Yeah, but...

315
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,273
Uh, for those of you
who have always wanted to see

316
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,401
the famous Brown Derby restaurant...

317
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,444
-Oh.
-...that's where it used to be.

318
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,031
-Oh.
-And on your left,

319
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,367
is the notorious spot where Hugh Grant...

320
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,743
-Hugh?
-...filmed the movie

321
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,578
<i>-Nine Months.</i>
<i>-</i>Eww!

322
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,083
You want me to replace
the villain with a dog?

323
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,501
I mean, nobody will know what's going on.

324
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,337
They will if you set up
that the dog is evil.

325
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,131
All you have to do
is show him doing this...

326
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,634
(humming sinister tune)

327
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,970
And people will suspect the dog.

328
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,888
Maybe this wasn't a good idea, Homer.

329
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,765
I'm sorry I dragged you out here.

330
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,392
Let me pay your bus fare home.

331
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,060
Uh-uh-uh, now, here's

332
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,979
your biggest problem of all.

333
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,063
The filibuster scene?

334
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,648
That was Jimmy Stewart's favorite.

335
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,401
And it was fine for the 1930s.

336
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,611
The country was doing great back then.

337
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,113
Everyone was into talking.

338
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,574
But now, in whatever year this is,

339
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,659
the audience wants action,

340
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,619
and seats with beverage holders,

341
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,163
but mainly action.

342
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,581
You really think the end is boring?

343
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,792
Oh, Mel, it's the most
boring piece of garbage

344
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,294
I've ever seen.

345
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,254
And it's not easy for me to say that.

346
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,173
Hmm, I guess it's a little flat.

347
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,591
Okay, let's reshoot the ending.

348
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,050
I'll call the hair and makeup ladies,

349
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,635
you see if the teamsters
will work for free.

350
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,636
Piece of cake.

351
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,889
Now, where's that kid with my latte?

352
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:47,850
According to the map,

353
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:48,976
this house is owned

354
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,728
-by the dog from <i>Frasier</i>.
<i>-</i>(dog barking)

355
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,606
And that's where Ellen Degeneres
and Anne Heche live.

356
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,734
-We're lesbians!
-We're lesbians!

357
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:57,651
(dog barking)

358
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,199
Okay, uh, this new ending...

359
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,325
that we shot last night...

360
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,785
is a little different than what we had,

361
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:06,994
but I think you'll like it.

362
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,370
It's missing some sound effects,

363
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,414
and the computer guys haven't added
the twinkle in my eye.

364
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,167
Mel, you're coming off desperate.

365
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,335
Roll it, Louie!

366
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,295
(movie reel rolling)

367
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,422
HOMER: Here comes two.

368
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,470
Well, I'm not licked.

369
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,514
And I'm going to stay right here

370
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,432
and fight for this lost cause.

371
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,935
Somebody will listen to me.

372
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,186
Somebody will...

373
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,063
(surprised murmurs)

374
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,733
I believe the senator
has yielded the floor.

375
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,901
(all laughing)

376
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,239
Yield this, Senator Payne.

377
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,240
(grunts)

378
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,658
(groans)

379
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,161
-(chuckles)
-(grunts)

380
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,707
I move we impose some serious term limits.

381
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,751
I second that motion...

382
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,837
with a vengeance.

383
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,219
All in favor, say "die."

384
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,263
(imitating Curly)

385
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,849
(people screaming)

386
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:16,313
Mr. Smith, this is highly unorthodox.

387
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,609
(people screaming)

388
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,158
I'm the President of the United States

389
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,369
and I demand to know what's going on here.

390
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:31,871
(grunts)

391
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,581
(screams)

392
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,086
Happy birthday, Mr. President.

393
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,380
(cheering)

394
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,475
Pretty cool, huh?

395
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,936
You, uh, you chopped off

396
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,271
the president's head.

397
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,606
Bet you didn't see that coming.

398
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,691
You impaled a United States Senator

399
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,901
with the American flag.

400
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,111
Why did Mr. Smith kill everybody?

401
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,863
It was symbolism.

402
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,448
He was mad.

403
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,159
But this was going to be
the studio's prestige picture

404
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,162
like <i>Howard's End </i>or <i>Sophie's Choice</i>.

405
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,247
Eww, those movies sucked.

406
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,833
I only saw them
to get Marge into the sack.

407
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,585
PS: Mission accomplished.

408
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,422
But we've already bought
five Golden Globe Awards.

409
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,466
I don't make movies to win awards,

410
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,760
especially now that I have two Oscars.

411
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,345
I make movies for guys like him.

412
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,181
-Yeah, guys like me.
-Who are you anyway?

413
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,350
Do the words "executive producer"

414
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,517
mean anything to you?

415
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,977
-Executive producer?
-We'll talk.

416
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,562
You've desecrated a classic film.

417
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,272
This is worse than <i>Godfather III</i>.

418
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,565
Whoa. Whoa, hey, whoa,

419
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,192
let's not say things we can't take back.

420
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,777
All right, all right, I'm sorry,

421
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,111
but this film

422
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,280
is never going to see the light of day.

423
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,448
(both gasps)

424
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,201
Look, they're towing away a range rover.

425
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,160
(gasping)

426
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,788
-WOMAN: There's no...
-Yoink! Come on, Homer.

427
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:56,830
We got a movie to premiere.

428
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,999
-HOMER: Woo-hoo!
-We've got to get that film back

429
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,668
or we'll all be fired.
You know what I mean?

430
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,920
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fired.
-Huh? Huh? Huh?

431
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,891
-Give us the film!
-Never.

432
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,018
TOUR GUIDE: And on your left,

433
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,770
you'll see Rainier Wolfcastle

434
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,856
filming his latest movie,
<i>Saving Irene Ryan.</i>

435
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,734
You put me down, you big lummox!

436
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,236
Jed!

437
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,489
Shut up, old lady,
and stop kicking me there.

438
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,368
-Watch out! Coming through!
-(people yelling)

439
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,703
Move!

440
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,496
Homer! Land mine!

441
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,414
I'm on it.

442
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,501
(both screaming)

443
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,585
Good night, Mr. Gibson.

444
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,503
Night, Gus.

445
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,422
(both screaming)

446
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,175
Oh, I'm getting too old for this crap.

447
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,760
How old are you anyway?

448
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,096
Well, I've been told I can play
anywhere from 28 to--

449
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,139
Sorry I asked.

450
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,851
Aw, crap, here they come.

451
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,852
Well, that's it, Homer.

452
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,645
We should have known better
than to match wits

453
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,938
with studio executives.

454
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,233
Hey, come on, turn that
down-under frown upside down.

455
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,401
We're not finished yet.

456
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,450
Wow, these dummies look pretty good.

457
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,119
Well, I've had a lot of surgery, old chum.

458
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,288
Shh. Mr. Limato said he'd fire us

459
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,123
if you didn't stop bothering
the customers.

460
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,335
Homer, what are you doing here?

461
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,837
No time talk. Need steal car.

462
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,131
Must save powerful,
but controversial movie. (gasp)

463
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,633
(stammering)

464
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,220
Hello.

465
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,638
Quick, Mel, get in.

466
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,432
(sighs) Forget it, Homer.

467
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,184
Let's just give them the stupid movie.

468
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,894
Movies aren't stupid.

469
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,979
They fill us with romance and hatred

470
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,689
and revenge fantasies.

471
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,400
<i>Lethal Weapon </i>showed us
that suicide is funny.

472
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,235
That really wasn't my intention.

473
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,279
Before <i>Lethal Weapon 2</i>, I never thought

474
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,531
there could be a bomb in my toilet.

475
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,284
But now I check every time.

476
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,119
It's true. He does.

477
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,497
Movies mean that much to you, Homer?

478
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,165
They're my only escape

479
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,918
from the drudgery of work and family.

480
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,630
-No offense.
-Oh, what the heck.

481
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:10,589
Let's hit the road.

482
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,508
Shove over, junior.

483
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,348
That thoughtless destruction

484
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,142
will surely bankrupt the museum, old chum.

485
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,102
Shut up.

486
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,948
Mom, you got to take
my picture in this car

487
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,074
so I can show Milhouse.

488
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,117
Oh, sorry, honey.

489
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,743
I used up the last roll on that man

490
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,203
I thought was Judge Judy.

491
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,496
Well, I think we lost them.

492
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,539
-(car slamming)
-(screams)

493
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,040
Oh, wait. There they are. (grunts)

494
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,543
Let me try something.
Take the wheel, Lisa.

495
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,086
-But my dad can--
-I said you.

496
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,505
We've got them now.

497
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,425
(screaming)

498
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,433
Oh, no! We killed Mel Gibson!

499
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,476
You all saw it.

500
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,228
He came at me with a knife, right?

501
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,066
Wait a minute. He's just a dummy.

502
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,776
I know, but he sells tickets.

503
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,572
Let's go.

504
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,243
Oh, great idea, Mel.

505
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,411
Now it's my turn.

506
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,540
-What are you doing?
-I'm tired of running away.

507
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,041
Did <i>Braveheart </i>run away?

508
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,960
Did <i>Payback </i>run away?

509
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,087
It's time we showed those suits

510
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,005
what we're made of.

511
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,800
The heck is that?

512
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,344
Well, the one on the left is Mel Gibson.

513
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,929
I don't know who the other two guys are.

514
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,931
Will you please tell me
the rest of the plan?

515
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,684
It's your plan from <i>Braveheart</i>.

516
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,853
Your army mooned the enemy

517
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,897
until they could take no more

518
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,856
and surrendered.

519
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,524
No. They didn't. They attacked us

520
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,359
in a horribly bloody battle, remember?

521
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,278
Actually, I didn't see it,
but on the poster...

522
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,196
Jump!

523
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,822
(yelling)

524
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,616
Homer, are you okay?

525
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,783
I think so.

526
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,619
No.

527
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,248
MR. SMITH: <i>All in favor, say, "die."</i>

528
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,791
(automatic gunfire)

529
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,211
Ooh, that digital sound

530
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,254
really lets you hear the blood splatter.

531
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,714
I don't get it, Mel.

532
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,507
How can you be so calm and cool?

533
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,885
My stomach's full of vomiting butterflies.

534
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,887
Okay, that's it.

535
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,013
(hums)

536
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,806
Let's get ready to meet our public.

537
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,850
(people grumbling)

538
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,518
Oh, well, that was disgusting.

539
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,604
Worst ending ever.

540
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,272
I think I'm going to be sick.

541
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,358
I'm Jimmy Stewart's granddaughter,

542
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,817
and you'll be hearing from my attorney.

543
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,777
-D'oh.
-Ow.

544
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,196
Oh, we should have put in the dog

545
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,697
with the shifty eyes.

546
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,157
Oh!

547
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,369
I'm sorry I ruined your career, Mel.

548
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,703
It's not your fault, Homer.

549
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,205
I guess there's just no room

550
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,040
in today's crazy, gentle America

551
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,251
for violent dinosaurs like us.

552
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,003
How did the country lose its way, Mel?

553
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,338
When did we stop rooting

554
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,215
for the man with the flame thrower

555
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,550
or an acid-spraying gun of some kind?

556
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,262
I blame the internet
and the return of swing music.

557
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,346
Well, whatever it is,

558
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,306
we got to get rolling on our next picture.

559
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,558
Hey, what about a prequel or something?

560
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,143
Everybody loves prequels.

561
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,645
-I don't.
-(grumbles)

562
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,064
Okay, Mr. Difficult.

563
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,774
How about a teen sex romp

564
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:16,733
where you and your buddies

565
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,610
are always trying to get some?

566
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,447
No, wait. A ghost who wins the lottery!

567
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,242
You could be the ghost
or the lottery commissioner.

568
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:28,328
Ooh! What about <i>Indiana Jones</i>?

569
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,830
Does anyone own the rights to that?

570
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:30,747
Ohh!

571
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,083
Hey, Mel, I fell out!

572
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,719
(dog barking)

573
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,889
(theme music playing)

574
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,927
-(murmuring)
-Shh!

575
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,096
(gibberish)

576
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,058
