00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:06,589
ANNOUNCER: <i>Live</i>
<i>from fabulous Centauri City.</i>

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,634
<i>It's the Simpsons Tenth Halloween Special.</i>

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,845
<i>Now, please welcome your hosts,</i>

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,472
<i>If you haven't been probed by these two,</i>

5
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,433
<i>you haven't been probed.</i>

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,477
<i>Kang and Kodos.</i>

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,563
(crowd cheering)

8
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,607
(smacking lips loudly)

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,775
Thank you. Thank you.

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,777
Yes, thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

11
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,196
Welcome to our tenth anniversary show.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,240
Oh, we've got a great--

13
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,242
Kang, what are you doing?

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,996
Well, you said we were
going to warm up the audience.

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,082
(canned laughter)

16
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,501
(grunts) Ladies and gentlemen

17
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,962
I have to apologize for my partner.

18
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,381
He had to borrow a human brain.

19
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,467
(canned laughter and applause)

20
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,511
What do aliens have to do with Halloween?

21
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,596
(man's voice) Silence.

22
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,903
(tires screeching)

23
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,785
I still can't believe we escaped
from those horrible vampires.

24
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,953
But it was worth it to get back our

25
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,997
Super Sugar Crisp cereal.

26
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,917
<i>♪ Can't get enough</i>
<i>with that Sugar Crisp... ♪</i>

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,002
I'm having a hard time seeing.

28
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,005
Homer, did you remember
to put the fog lights in?

29
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,216
<i>♪ Guess I forgot</i>
<i>to put the fog lights in ♪</i>

30
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,343
I better pull over and play it safe.

31
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,595
(loud thud)

32
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,055
(gasps)

33
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,181
Please be a dog.

34
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,142
(gasping)

35
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,393
Oh, no!

36
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,730
Ned Flanders.

37
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,941
-(squish)
-He's dead.

38
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,400
(squishing)

39
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,902
He's definitely dead.

40
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,487
(squishing)

41
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,738
Oh, my God.

42
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,824
We killed Ned Flanders.

43
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,784
You mean, <i>you </i>killed Ned Flanders.

44
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,286
Oh, it was an accident. An accident!

45
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,122
We got to go to the police.

46
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,040
They'll never believe
a Simpson killed a Flanders

47
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,291
by accident.

48
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,918
Even I have my doubts.

49
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,336
Don't worry, I got a plan.

50
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,672
OK, Ned, the first thing we have to do

51
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:14,050
(whispering) is to make sure
that no one knows that you're dead.

52
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:18,972
If anyone asks you,
just say that you're not dead.

53
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,349
Hey, Maude!

54
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,519
Look who's helping me clean the chimney.

55
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:27,981
Neddy?

56
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:28,982
Where have you been?

57
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,901
Hi, Maude... Diddily.

58
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,697
I've been having fun with my pal Homer.

59
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,490
Diddily.

60
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,534
Oh, I'm so relieved.

61
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:42,495
Whenever you go on one
of your late-night fog walks,

62
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,997
I get so worried.

63
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,541
Relax. I'm fine.

64
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:50,837
But when I do die,
I don't want any autopsies.

65
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,631
Well, come on down, you goofy roofy.

66
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,259
-Wow, it sure is slippery up here.
-(bell dings)

67
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,510
My pies are done.

68
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:58,928
(thuds)

69
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,306
Aw, she missed it.

70
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,475
Hey, Maude, I'm home!

71
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,188
Uh-oh, I think I'm having a heart attack!

72
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,689
(thuds)

73
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,609
(Maude screams)

74
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,528
And that's the end of that chapter.

75
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,490
(bell ringing)

76
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,535
Aw. (sobbing)

77
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,456
(whispering) Try not to look too sad.

78
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,791
It'll seem suspicious.

79
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:34,547
And now Ned's best friend
will say a few words.

80
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,965
Homer.

81
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,050
(clears throat)

82
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,051
When I think about Ned,

83
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,427
I can't help but remember

84
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,720
the look on his face

85
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,222
when Marge drove over...

86
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,514
Homer shut up, shut up, shut up.

87
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,933
Oh, wait.

88
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,726
What I'd like to say is

89
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,854
we're still looking for the real killers.

90
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,481
Anyway, in conclusion,

91
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,108
a man cannot be forced
to testify against his wife.

92
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,486
MARGE: Stop winking.

93
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,529
We'll miss you, buddy.

94
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,951
Hey, we just got away with murder.

95
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,702
And it was so easy.

96
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,080
No, I've never liked the little wiener

97
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,373
Milhouse.

98
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,290
(tires screeching)

99
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,917
MARGE: No more murders.

100
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,585
But you got to kill--

101
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,670
No!

102
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,089
(gasps)

103
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,716
Someone saw us.

104
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,551
ALL: But who?

105
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,227
Homer, stop that.

106
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,980
(thunder rumbling)

107
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,564
(phone ringing)

108
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,525
Who could be calling at this hour?

109
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,111
(stammering)

110
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,445
Y'ello?

111
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,781
(creepy voice) <i>I know you're alone.</i>

112
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,825
Oh... who is this?

113
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,411
<i>Is this Maude Flanders?</i>

114
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,454
No, it's... Homer.

115
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,290
(normal voice<i>) Oh, hey, Homer, it's Moe.</i>

116
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,916
<i>I must've dialed the wrong number.</i>

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,501
(thunder rumbling loudly)

118
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,130
(all screaming)

119
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,180
HOMER: Get in the car.

120
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,974
(starting engine)

121
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,351
(all screaming)

122
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,397
Dear God, it's Homer.

123
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,398
If you really love me,

124
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,899
you'll save my life now.

125
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,484
HOMER: D'oh.

126
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,611
(engine sputtering)

127
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,449
He's getting closer!

128
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,159
(all gasp)

129
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,453
(thunder rumbling)

130
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,830
OK, Marge, you hide
in the abandoned amusement park.

131
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,540
Lisa, the Pet Cemetery.

132
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,043
Bart, spooky roller disco.

133
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,713
And I'll go skinny-dipping in that lake

134
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,382
where the sexy teens were killed
a hundred years ago tonight.

135
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,010
Now, Flanders, I want you to...

136
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,721
(screaming)

137
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,848
It's impossible. I killed you.

138
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,976
(chuckles) You can't kill
the undead, silly.

139
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,144
(squishes)

140
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,062
He's undead, all right.

141
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,146
Are you a zombie?

142
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,731
Oh, I wish.

143
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,776
You see, that night
when you hit me with your car...

144
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,196
I'm making record time on this fog walk.

145
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,864
(wolf howling)

146
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,449
Better pick up the pace.

the cutest police officer in Springfield.

173
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,199
Hey, you know,
we got feelings, too, chief.

174
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,035
Just dump your candy
on the X- ray belt, Ralphie.

175
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,787
There's a good boy.

176
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,998
Safe. Safe.

177
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,208
Razor blade. Syringe.

178
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,751
Ooh, white chocolate.

179
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,961
Check it out, Lisa.

180
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,754
I'm radioactive man.

181

I don't think the real radioactive man

182
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,135
wears a plastic smock
with a picture of himself on it.

183
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,970

00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,351
Get in there, you stupid pillowcase.

186
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,061
Stop it. You'll jam the machine.

187
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,480
(rumbling)

188
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,107
Uh-oh. Radiation! Duck and cover!

189
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,192
(screaming)

190
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,151
Cool!

191
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,444
Bart!

192
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,073
Oh, my god! Lisa!

193
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,743
She's been crushed

194
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,246
and so have the hopes
of our mathletics team.

195
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,998
Hold the funeral, poindexter.

196
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,167
"Poindexter?"

197
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,793
(grunting)

198
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,420
Whoa, Lise, those X-rays

199
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,255
must have given you super strength!

200
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,132
I wonder if I got any powers.

201
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:30,968
Nope, looks normal.

202
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,762
Wait a minute.

203
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,888
I can stretch.

204
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,433
Look at me! Ow!

205
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,768
Hot-hot-hot!

206
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,604
I must only use this power to annoy.

207
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,732
(knocking at door)

208
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,317
Now, who could that be at this hour?

209
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,947
Yes? Yes? Up? Down? Side to side?

210
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,031
What's your point?

211
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,115
Ow!

212
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,325
(laughing)

213
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,368
I Gotcha.

214
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,661
Bart, with these powers,

215
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,371

216
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,414

227
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,946
But I'm sure that once girls
get to know the real you

228
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,406
you'll get plenty of dates.

229
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,657
Next question.

230
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,033
Yes, over here.

231
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,159
(clearing throat)

232
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,161
In episode BF12,

233
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,955
you were battling Barbarians

234
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,124
while riding a winged appaloosa

235
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,750
yet in the very next scene, my dear,

236
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,420
you're clearly atop a winged Arabian.

237
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,629
Please to explain it.

238
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,298
Ah. Yeah. Well,

239
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,341
whenever you notice something like that,

240
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,259
a wizard did it.

241
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,552
I see. All right. Yes.

242
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,012
But in episode AG4...

243
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,972
-Wizard.
-Ah. For glayvin out loud.

244
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,807
(glass shattering)

245
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,852
Behold! I am the Collector

246
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,771
and I'm here to add you to my collection.

247
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,109
(clanking)

248
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,445
(grunting)

249
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:16,032
Must remove... my breastplate!

250
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,116
(groaning)

251
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,326
Maybe later.

252
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,581
Care for a Rolo, sweet Xena?

253
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,708
All right, Collector,
stick this in your tweezers.

254
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,876
I'm not Xena!

255
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,336
I'm an actress, you lunatic!

256
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,337
Oh, please.

257
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,755
I'm not insane.

258
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,132
I simply wish to take you back to my lair

259
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,300
and make you my bride.

260
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,968
Oh, dear God!

261
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,641
Clobber Girl?

262
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,850
(grunting)

263
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:44,894
Thank you.

264
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,313
Help!

265
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,941
It's Xena!

266
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,526
She's been kidnapped.

267
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,569
-(gasps)
-Come on.

268
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,658
Remember, you're vulnerable to kryptonite.

269
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,785
Geez, Marge, tell the neighborhood!

270
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,458
Fear not, my syndicated sweetie.

271
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,378
You'll be preserved in this mylar pouch

272
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:14,215
forever remaining in...
near-mint condition

273
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,134
between Dr. Who and,
of course, Yasmine Bleeth.

274
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,302
I don't think so.

275
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,638
(grunting)

276
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,597
I don't think so either.

277
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,101
(mocking in sing-song voice)

278
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,854
Your collecting days are over, Collector.

279
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,815
Stop right there!

280
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,776
I have here the only
working phaser ever built.

281
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,445
It was fired only once
to keep William Shatner

282
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,780
from making another album.

283
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,366
Stretch dude-- Help!

284
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,450
Just a sec.

285
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,789
(grunting)

286
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,291
(phaser humming)

287
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,128
-Whoa!
-Hey, phaser, phaser, phaser. Zing!

288
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,046
(phaser clicking)

289
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,507
-(groans)
-Ne ne!

290
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,597
Good night, "Retch" Dude
and "Slobber" Girl.

291
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,558
Sweet screams.

292
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,602

I'm unbelievably amused.

293
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,562
(grunting and groaning)

294
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,355
Soon, those bratty buttinskies

295
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,857
will be encased in lucite

296
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,400
for all eternity.

297
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,152
While we're waiting, here's some names

298
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,862
you may call me on our wedding night.

299
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:18,946
(clears throat)

300
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,573
"Obi-Wan," "Iron Man,"

301
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,199
"Mr. Mxyzptlk"

302
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,076
and, of course, "Big Papa Smurf."

303
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,619
What do you need me for?

304
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,080
You could have your choice of
any of the women in these bags.

305
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,707
You would think so, but no.

306
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,167
Really?

307
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,796
Well, I mean, maybe
we are meant for each other.

308
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,757
Growing up, I was always tall for my age

309
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,008
and the other kids made fun of me.

310
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,634
I... I always hoped

311
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,136
for another misunderstood soul

312
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,846
to share my pain and...

313
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,140
you could be that soul, Collector.

314
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,308
Oh...

315
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,893
Come here, you.

316
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,020
Xena needs xex.

317
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,939

318
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,984
Got your lips!

Oh!

322
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,240
You tricked me

323
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,992
with a ruse so hackneyed

324
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,745
-it would make Stan Lee blush.
-Shut up.

325
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:08,954

00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,543
Oh! Ow!

328
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,045
Ow, that hurts!

329
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,301
Bart, just let me drop and save yourself.

330
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,345
What do you think I've been trying to do?

331
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,014
Aha!

332
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,017
Not even Xena is a match
for the limited edition

337
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,986
You removed it
from its original packaging.

338
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,571
(gasping) No!

339
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,281
It's no longer a collectible.

340

341
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,996

Wow.

00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,596
Thanks for saving us.

350
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,806
No problem.

351
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,099
Now, let's get you kids home.

352
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,851
Wait a minute.

353
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:12,977
Xena can't fly.

354
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,812
I told you. I'm not Xena.

This is Dick Clark,

We're Poison.

372
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,568
Oh, man, what'd I do now?

373
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,403
Wonderful. Now, that song is dedicated

374
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,487
to all you super geeks

375
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,822
who rocked around the clock

376
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,409
to exterminate America's Y2K bugs.
Slammin'!

377
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:14,538
Hey, Homer, weren't you the plant's
Y2K compliance officer?

378
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,873
Absolutely.

379
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,751
Must have been hard debugging
all those computers, huh, Homer?

380
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,877
Doing what now?

381
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,795
You did fix them, right, Dad?

382
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,465
Because even a single
faulty unit could corrupt

383
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,800
every other computer in the world.

384
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,636
That can't be true, Honey.

385
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,055
If it were, I'd be terrified.

386
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,599
Eight, seven, six...

387
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,809
We want to thank Dixie brand mayonnaise.

388
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,895
Whoo lawdy, what a mayonnaise.

389
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,146
Three, two...

390
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,774
(buzzer)

391
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,817
That's Homer Simpsons's computer.

392
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,527
Oh, God. It's spreading!

393
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,907
Happy New... Wha...?

394
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,825
Oh, no. It's happening.

395
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,664
(screaming)

396
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,876
Uh-oh.

397
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,796
(screaming)

398
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,382
("Auld Lang Syne" playing)

399
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,808
Ha! Wha...?

400
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:16,767
(muffled) Ha.

401
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,982
(grunts)

402
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,235
Who's going to clean up all those jets?

403
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,695
(crashing continues)

404
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,406
There goes the clothesline.

405
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,659
Well, those ivory tower
eggheads have screwed us again.

406
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,702
(chuckles)

407
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,204
Let's just have some milk and go to bed.

408
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,205
(yells)

409
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,957
Hey, this milk's broken!

410
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,542
It's got a computer chip in it.

411
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,876
Everything does.

412
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,044
-(alarm ringing)
-(both gasp)

413
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,131
-(doors slamming)
-(motors whirring)

414
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,340
D'oh! Ow!

415
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,508
(muttering)

416
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,262
(yowling)

417
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,304
(groaning in fear)

418
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,224
(yelling)

419
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,019
Judgment Day is upon us.

420
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,438
I warned you the Lord wouldn't stand

421
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,523
for your minidresses and Beatle boots...

422
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,360
I resisted these for 35 years.

423
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,695
Why did I wear them today?

424
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,948
But it's not too late
to repent your sins

425
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,409
and be embraced by the almighty!

426
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,286
Hey, everybody, they're looting the mall.

427
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,830
Hurry! I got nine shoe buffers.

428
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,874
(all cheering)

429
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,544
I'm caught on something.

430
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,212
I don't want you looting.

431
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,339
But I was going to loot you a present.

432
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,466
Oh, all right.

433
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,759
Yay!

434
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,385
(sirens blaring)

435
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,597
(screaming and yelling)

436
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,142
Oh, thank you, Homey.

437
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,810
A lady Remington.

438
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,270
(whirring)

439
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,271
(yells)

440
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,110
(yelling)

441
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:58,994
Well, look at the wonders
of the Computer Age now.

442
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,997
Wonders, Lisa, or blunders?

443
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,957
I think that was implied by what I said.

444
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,669
Implied, Lisa, or implode?

445
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,838
Mom, make him stop.

446
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,964
(man groaning)

447
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,716
Oh, no, Krusty.

448
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,301
(groaning continues)

449
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,429
My pacemaker, it's stuck on hummingbird!

450
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,680
Nectar, nectar!

451
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,599
I need to drink my weight in nectar.

452
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,600
(loud thud)

453
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,852
Krusty!

454
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:25,896
Hey, a note.

455
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,276
"You have been selected
for Operation Exodus."

456
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,487
They're evacuating the Earth.

457
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,489
Oh, we're saved!

458
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:39,368
(sobbing) Thank you, sweet clown.

459
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,329
In death, you saved us all.

460
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,124
KRUSTY: (weakly) I'm not dead.

461
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,460
I can still hear his voice on the wind.

462
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,587
BART: There it is.

463
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,423
Just like the dead clown promised.

464
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,801
(elevator bell dings)

465
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,012
BART: Wow. There's Bill Gates,

466
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,265
Stephen Hawking, Paul McCartney,

467
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,517
Michael Jordan, Michelle Kwan...

468
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,561
They must be starting
a new civilization on Mars

469
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,229
with our best and brightest.

470
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,564
That's us!

471
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,150
-Name, please.
-Certainly.

472
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,445
I am... the, uh, piano genius
from the movie <i>Shine.</i>

473
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,114
Uh-huh. And your name is?

474
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,701
Uh... Shiny McShine?

475
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,244
Actually, he's Homer Simpson.

476
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,704
That's Bart. I'm Lisa.

477
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,788
Lisa Simpson?

478
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,290
Oh, you're the ship's proofreader.

479
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,374
Welcome aboard.

480
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,001
Now, before you enter you're going

481
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,128
to have to make a very difficult choice.

482
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,589
You're only allowed
to take one parent with you.

483
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,506
Mom.

484
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,509
Love you lots.

485
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,969
Good-bye, Lisa.

486
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,512
Remember me as I am--

487
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,890
Filled with murderous rage.

488
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,313
Well, son, I guess this is the end.

489
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,441
But we've both had long, full lives.

490
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,776
Oh, right.

491
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,695
Hey, look, another spaceship.

492
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,197
And there's nobody guarding it.

493
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,615
Let's go.

494
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,496
I can't believe I destroyed the Earth.

495
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,041
Are you still talking about the Earth?

496
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,584
Right, got to let it go.

497
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,461
All that counts is we're alive

498
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,713
and rubbing elbows with the greats.

499
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,381
(gasps) Ooh.

500
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,716
There's Ross Perot.

501
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,092
Dr. Laura.

502
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,385
Spike Lee.

503
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,471
Wait a minute.
They're not so great.

504
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,805
OK, but there's

505
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,016
Dan Quayle and Courtney Love,

506
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,726
Tanya Harding,

507
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,186
Al Sharpton?

508
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,188
(screams) Tom Arnold!

509
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,648
What the hell's going on?

510
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,442
Wait. Only that ship is going to Mars.

511
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,236
Ours is headed for the sun.

512
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,737
Yeah, ain't that a kick in the teeth?

513
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,405
I mean, my shows weren't great but I never

514
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,199
tied people up and forced them to watch,

515
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,700
and I could've, 'cause I'm a big guy

516
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,785
and I'm good with knots.

517
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,536
So, we're all going to die?

518
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,497
Afraid so, but, hey,
the grub's pretty good, huh?

519
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,957
(laughs)

520
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,876
The Sun?

521
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,586
That's the hottest place on Earth.

522
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,382
Gonna work on my tannage, buddy.

523
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,633
Pauly Shore? Wow!

524
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,927
Hey, we should do a show together, man.

525
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,637
That's a sure cure for the blues.

526
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,055
(blowing noisemaker)

527
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,724
Hey, turn those frowns around!

528
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,852
Oh, no, Rosie O'Donnell!

529
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,397
Come on, everybody, sing along.

Don't worry, Dad.
We'll be dead in five minutes.

538
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,123
Not fast enough.

539
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,085
