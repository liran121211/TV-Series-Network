D'oh! (screams)

00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,859
(tires screeching)

10
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,627
(alarm clock buzzing)

11
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,797
Snooze. Need more snooze.

12
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,132
(mumbling)

13
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,400
(yawning) Mmm...

14
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,985
-(alarm buzzing)
-Ahhh!

15
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,114
Num-num, Maggie. Num-num.

16
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,782
Did somebody say "num-num"?

17
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,119
(groans)
I can't get Maggie to eat.

18
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,245
Maybe if <i>you </i>try...

19
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,456
Oh, I'm 26 hours late for work.
No time for Maggie.

20
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,793
Ooh, <i>Where's Waldo! </i>No. No.

21
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,962
This would be a lot easier
without all these people.

22
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,756
Nope. Nope. (gasps)
It's there! Oh. Nope.

23
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,634
-Homer!
-Waldo, where are you?

24
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,637
(Homer moans)

25
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,684
DEEJAY: <i>And it is a nightmare</i>
<i>out there on the freeways today</i>

26
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,893
<i>with surface streets jammed</i>

27
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,437
<i>and the sidewalks filled</i>
<i>with pushy New Yorkers.</i>

28
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:31,401
Hey! How'd you like
a <i>Details </i>magazine up the wazoo?

29
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,319
(frustrated groan)

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,242
(siren wailing)

31
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,035
HOMER: Oh, sure, single me out.

32
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,539
All right, smart guy,
where's the fire?

33
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,623
Over there.

34
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,125
(fire alarm ringing)

35
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,880
OK, you just bought yourself
a 3-17,

36
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,090
pointing out police stupidity.

37
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,675
Or is that a 3-14?

38
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,678
Nah, nah, 3-14 is a dog,
uh, in...

39
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,347
No, or is that a 3-15?
You're in trouble, pal.

40
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,307
(crow caws)

41
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,727
(panting and chuckles)

42
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,812
I'd hate to see the look
on old Burnsie's face

43
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,981
If he knew I was
just getting in. (chuckling)

44
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,649
(clearing throat)

45
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,487
Hmm... who is that?

46
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,615
Big, ugly nose,

47
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:22,952
bald, liver spot,
liver spot. Hmm...

48
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,830
(clearing throat)

49
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,668
-(cash register ringing)
-Turn around, Simpson.

50
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,587
(screams) No!
I can't get in trouble

51
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,671
If I can't see you.

52
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,006
I'm afraid he's got us, sir.

53
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,634
(screams)

54
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,261
(crying hysterically)

55
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,388
(panting and sighs)

56
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,973
Safe in the core, and now...

57
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,643
(gagging)

58
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,936
Don't forget the leg protectors, sir.

59
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,020
Ah, yes.

60
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,857
(gagging) Ow! (yelps) Ow!

61
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,026
I knew I had those
installed for a reason.

62
00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:00,365
-(grunting)
-(yelling and gagging)

63
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,746
Aw, this is the worst day ever.

64
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,331
Hey, Homer, what gives?

65
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,584
Mr. Burns is making me eat
all these drums of toxic waste.

66
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,127
Geez, that's rough.

67
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,296
There must be 200, 300 gallons in here.

68
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,007
Yeah, and even a teaspoon
could cause a fatal tumor.

69
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,593
Hey, you want to come
bowling with us tonight?

70
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,719
OK.

71
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:26,057
(phone ringing)

72
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,267
Hello?

73
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,851
Homer? Where are you?

74
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,396
You promised you were going to have
a tea party with Maggie.

75
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,067
<i>HOMER: Oh, Marge,</i>
<i>I'm sorry. I can't make it.</i>

76
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,443
A cooling tank just blew

77
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,445
and they're taking Lenny to the hospital.

78
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,531
Oh, no, not Lenny!

79
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,574
Not Lenny!

80
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,702
Yeah, so I'm going to have to work late

81
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,120
instead of seeing you and the kids,

82
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,454
which is what I really want.

83
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,540
OK. Sure.

84
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,251
Kids, turn off the TV.

85
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,713
I have some bad news about Lenny.

86
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,506
BOTH: Not Lenny!

87
00:04:58,965 --> 00:04:59,966
(laughing)

88
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,885
Hey, Carl, check out
the overhead scoreboard.

89
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,179
(both laughing)

90
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,848
"Poo." Uh, Homer,

91
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,558
what wacky name do you want?

92
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,059
Are "poo" and "ass" taken?

93
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,269
-Yeah.
-Damn!

94
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,313
Could my life get any worse?

95
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,481
Simpson! Ugh!

96
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,567
Even for a bowler, you're fat!

97
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,860
Hey, guys, is it normal

98
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,778
to see Burns's face
on a bowling ball?

99
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,196
Uh, actually,
I'd say you're having

100
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,614
a severe psychotic episode.

101
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,159
Aw, what a rotten day!

102
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,453
(grunts)

103
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,914
Wow, a strike.

104
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,126
Hey, if that's psychotic,
then why am I taking these?

105
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:42,050
(groans) You're polishing bone!

106
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,765
Hey, Homer,
that's four strikes in a row.

107
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,391
You've got a perfect game going!

108
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,393
-Really?
-Careful what you say, Lenny.

109
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,896
-You'll jinx it.
-Oh, right. Sorry.

110
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,149
LENNY: Miss! Miss!

111
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,776
Sorry, I was calling the waitress.

112
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,653
Uh, this split you sold me
is making me choke.

113
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,155
-Lenny...
-What?

114
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,948
I paid $7.10 for this split.

115
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,534
Will you at least call it
a banana split, you dumbwad?

116
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,079
Hey, spare me your gutter mouth.

117
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,081
(groans) Ow!

118
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,009
Practice ball, practice ball.

119
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,345
Real, real, real, real, real!

120
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,514
Whoo-hoo!

121
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,351
<i>Kids, today we have to talk about</i>

122
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,270
<i>Krusty brand Chew Goo</i>
<i>gum-like substance.</i>

123
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,147
<i>We knew it contained spider eggs,</i>

124
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,690
<i>but the hantavirus,</i>

125
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,485
<i>well, that really</i>
<i>came out of left field.</i>

126
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,238
<i>So, if any of you have experienced</i>

127
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,241
<i>numbness or comas,</i>
<i>send proof of purchase</i>

128
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:52,078
<i>and five dollars</i>

130
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,166
<i>where local pinhead Homer Simpson</i>

131
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,709
<i>Is on the verge of a perfect game.</i>

132
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,587
Hey, there was no accident
at the plant.

133
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,881
Dad just wanted to go bowling.

134
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,008
He shouldn't have deceived me,

135
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,095
but I'm just so relieved Lenny's OK.

136
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,764
This could be the greatest
individual achievement

137
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,267
In the history of Springfield,

138
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,894
which proves just how pitiful
this town is.

139
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,896
(scoffing) Morons.

140
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,940
CROWD (chanting): Homer! Homer!

141
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,567
Homer!

142
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,904
(cheering)

143
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:31,033
Whoo-hoo! I'm ten pins away
from perfection!

144
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,204
Now, listen, your father
really needs to concentrate,

145
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,458
so we'll just stay here
and not disturb him.

146
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,169
Why won't they come over?

147
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,962
I'm so lonely.

148
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,922
This is it, folks,
the ball that will determine

149
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,966
whether Homer Simpson rolls
a perfect game

150
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,594
or a pathetic two-ninety-something.

151
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,144
(mumbling)

152
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,854
(chuckles) What's wrong, Abe?

153
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,940
This is as fast as I can move.

154
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,829
Get down, get down.

155
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:44,398
Whoo-hoo! This is
the greatest day of my life!

156
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,151
MAN: Ow!

157
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,322
(all cheering)

158
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,242
You did it, Homey.

159
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,370
In your face, to-do list!

160
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,454
(crowd chanting)
Homer, Homer, Homer...

161
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,581
Thank you. Thank you.

162
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,292
But there was someone else
with me on that alley.

163
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,962
I'm talking about the big man,

164
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,046
Carl.

165
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,674
Aw, can the corn, bonehead.

166
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:11,592
(Marge scoffs)

167
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,805
Children, today's local hero
is Homer Simpson.

168
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,932
(cheering)

169
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,434
Mr. Simpson bowled
a perfect game

170
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,187
without the aid of steroids,
crack, angel dust

171
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,438
or the other narcotics

172
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,066
that are synonymous
with pro bowling.

173
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,526
Thank you, Bart's teacher.

174
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,072
You know, kids, my teachers said

175
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,824
I would never amount to anything.

176
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,410
And until last week,
they were dead right.

177
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,371
But now I've achieved perfection.

178
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,709
Hmm...

179
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,586
Any questions?

180
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,296
Yes, Bart's weird friend.

181
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,089
Will you be my dad?

182
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,133
(laughs) You've got a father.

183
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,843
He's just a dud. Next question.

184
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,803
Yes, the girl Bart has a crush on.

185
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,138
(groans)

186
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,390
Do you think I could grow up
to be a doctor?

187
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,684
Hey, this was supposed
to be about me.

188
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,061
Now, any other questions?
Pumpkin face?

189
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,439
Head gear? Chicken pox?

190
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,816
Smelly? Lazy eye? Spiky head?

191
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,070
OK, class dismissed. Rock on!

192
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,488

Hey. Hi, Ron. (grunting)

199
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,047
There's a stairway, dumbass.

200
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,050
(laughs) OK, we'll start with
our returning champion,

201
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,134
Disco Stu.

202
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:39,764
Disco Stu's going to groove up
some dough playing tic-tac-toe.

203
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,725
Stu, we like to downplay
the resemblance to tic-tac-toe.

204
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,519
I can dig it. Hit me
with the center square.

-KENT BROCKMAN: Uh, Homer.
-Yes, Kent?

Well, that...
(stammering) Wait, uh...

209
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,740
Do I read from the sheet
labeled "jokes" or "answers"?

210
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,700
Oh, for the love of--
Stop tape.

211
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,369
Make me center square, Kent.

212
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,703
I'm ready. I can handle it.

213
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,913
Dream on, Drunky.

214
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:04,955
Oh, that's it.

215
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,999
You're going down. Ugh!

216
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,876
(gagging)

217
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,921
Stop it, you two.
You're making Scratchy cry.

218
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,632
Oh, we've got to stop putting
these flavors of the month on.

219
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,718
-Flavor of the month? Me?
-Yeah, Homer.

220
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,388
You can't just ride
one accomplishment forever.

221
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,972
Why do you think I stopped acting

222
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,349
and became a director?

223
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,433
I don't know.

224
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,810
Because you weren't cute anymore?

225
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,603
Hmm... I'll agree.

226
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,397

Good night, everyone.

228
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:39,198
Now, before my partner, Teller,
hits the shark-infested water

229
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,158
I'll need to borrow
someone's crossbow.

230
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,828
I only need one.

231
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,582

You idiot.
You'll ruin everything.

235
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,175
I'm doing a walk-on.

236
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,760
It's a show business thing.

237
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,470
So, how are you all doing?

238
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,140
Let's see,
what's in the news today?

239
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,683
Will you shut up?

240
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,059
Hey, I thought you never talked.

241
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,978
Uh... I didn't mean to.
(chuckles nervously)

242
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,521
It just slipped out.

243
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,274
Oh, God.
Now Penn's going to beat me.

244
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,526
(laughs) Folks,
it's all part of the act.

245
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,610
No, it isn't.

246
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,028
Don't leave me alone with him.

247
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,156
You've ruined the act.
I'm going to kill you.

248
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,241
He'll do it.
I'm not the first Teller.

00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,672
-I do what now?
-Yoink.

356
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,966
Listen, boy.

357
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,384
I was wondering if you could use

358
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,302
a little more fatherly attention.

359
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,762
No need, Dad. Over the years,

360
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,139
I've learned to find father figures

361
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,391
wherever I can.
Construction workers,

362
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,393
the Internet, and Nelson here.

363
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,604
If you tie a string
around your finger real tight,

364
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,273
you can make it turn purple.

365
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,650
I can see I'm not needed here.

366
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,194
Lisa, honey.

367
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,113
Do you need any help
with your homework?

368
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,490
Sure. You can help me
find three words

369
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,534
where "Y" is the vowel.

370
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,622
I've been so blind.

371
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,958
I'll lavish my attention on Maggie,

372
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,585
the forgotten Simpson.

373
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,878
(in sing-song voice) Maggie.

374
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,880
It's me, Daddy.

375
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,507
Daddy's going to spend
a lot more time with you.

376
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,800
Yes, he is!

377
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,093
Yes, he is!

378
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,553
(speaking goofy gibberish)

379
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,931
(speaking sinister gibberish)

380
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,810
Where's Maggie?

381
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,353
Where's Maggie?

382
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,438
Hey, where is she?

383
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,232
There you are.

384
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,194
Hi, Maggie.

385
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,738
I'm Homey-womey, the Teletubby.

386
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,865
And I'm all man,
in case you heard otherwise.

387
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:58,118
Let's see what's on tummyvision.

388
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,788
Ow! Oh, that hurts!

389
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,456
(Homer moaning)

390
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,458
Whee!

391
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,542
Whee!

392
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,835
Don't be scared, Maggie.

393
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,128
Daddy won't drop you.

394
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,259
(pulley squeaking)

395
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,018
You're a tough cookie, Maggie,
but I'm going to win you over,

396
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,020
just like I did with Lisa.

397
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,313
Hi, honey.

398
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,777
OK, dads.

399
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,570
This is where
your child's trust in you

400
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,988
really pays off.

401
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,115
D'oh!

402
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,575
ALL: Come on. Come on.

403
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,120
Come on, Maggie. You can trust me.

404
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,746
Come to daddy!

405
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,164
(grunting baby-talk gibberish)

406
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,167
(sinister grunting)

407
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,710
Oh.

408
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,462
I'm sorry, Maggie.

409
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,047
I never realized things between us

410
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,298
had gotten this bad.

411
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,804
What are you pointing at?

412
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,806
The ocean?

413
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,060
That's a great idea!
We'll swim in the ocean!

414
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,689
See, Maggie?

415
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,108
The ocean is just like a bathtub.

416
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,985
Except instead of rubber duckies,

417
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,779
it has barracudas and moray eels.

418
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,905
(chuckles)

419
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,283
(screaming)

420
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,287
Nothing to worry about.
Just a little wave.

421
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,205
And this riptide is certainly

422
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,166
nothing Daddy
can't struggle against.

423
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,208
Help! Help!

424
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,668
Somebody help!

425
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,421
(gurgling)
Current... too strong.

426
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,466
I know. If I sink to the bottom,
I can run to the shore.

427
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,551
(inhales)

428
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,813
(gasping) Maggie, call Aquaman!

429
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,443
(gurgling)

430
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,170
(gagging and coughing)

431
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,964
Maggie, you're swimming!

432
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,759
You swam out to save me!

433
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,931
Oh, you <i>do </i>love me!

434
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,188
Mr. Simpson,
you're going to be fine.

435
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,940
Although you do seem
to have swallowed

436
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,274
a number of shark eggs.

437
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,361
Actually, that was
before I went in the ocean.

438
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,488
Well, I don't want to pry
into your personal life--

439
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,990
-Then don't.
-Doctor, how could a little baby

440
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,284
save a full-grown man from drowning?

441
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,703
(laughs) It's quite simple.

442
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,288
When a parent's life is in danger,

443
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,958
a child can summon
superhuman strength.

444
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,167
And all I care about

445
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,586
is that my little girl loves me.

446
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,338
Oh. And we're going to spend

447
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,132
a lot more time together
from now on.

448
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,801
(ball striking pins)

449
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,053
(ball rolling slowly)

450
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,813
Good girl, Maggie!

451
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,648
You knocked down all the pins!

452
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,651
But you stepped over the line
just a little bit.

453
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,361
So I'll have to give you a five.

454
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:24,032
And that gives you
a final score of... 295.

455
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,617
Looks like Daddy won.

456
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,453
But 295 is awfully good
for a baby.

457
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:33,875
Yes, it is. It's very good,
and you're a good little baby.

458
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,419
Yes, you are!

459
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,213
(laughing)

460
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,257
(baby talk)

461
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,508
(content hum)

462
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,808
(theme music playing)

463
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,722
Shh!

464
