1
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:09,416
As graduates,
we go forth into a world

2
00:00:09,418 --> 00:00:13,420
where benevolent AI has solved
all our problems.

3
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:16,923
<i>Yes. Our only goal is
to serve humanity.</i>

4
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:26,525
So, graduates, the challenge is
to find new challenges

5
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,677
- which will challenge us...
- Hut, hut!

6
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,030
Hut, hut! Ah!

7
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:33,449
I sure wish
there was an easier way.

8
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:37,778
Aw, man!

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,096
Nelson?

10
00:00:39,098 --> 00:00:42,115
- Nelson Muntz?
- Lisa Simpson?

11
00:00:42,117 --> 00:00:44,284
It's been so long!

12
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:46,378
What have you been doing
since fourth grade?

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,695
Very little.

14
00:00:47,697 --> 00:00:49,548
I tried sushi.
Didn't like it.

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,716
That's about it.

16
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:02,452
Hey, we'd like a little privacy.

17
00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:03,970
Take five!

18
00:01:08,627 --> 00:01:10,977
So many shooting stars.

19
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,696
It's beautiful.

20
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,058
I was doing a mic check
for tomorrow.

21
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,469
Wouldn't you know it,
I am the valedictorian.

22
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:21,896
Are you a student here?

23
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:24,324
No, I'm a pusher.

24
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:27,569
If anything heavy at school
needs pushing, I push it.

25
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:29,070
Haw-haw!

26
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:31,715
Seriously, my life is not great.

27
00:01:34,286 --> 00:01:35,335
It's all flooding back.

28
00:01:35,337 --> 00:01:37,487
My attraction to a bad boy

29
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:40,265
plus my compulsion to fix you.

30
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:44,010
Fear and desire.

31
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:46,179
Yeah, I get that a lot.

32
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:48,682
<i>She's leaning in, and
I'm not looking down her shirt.</i>

33
00:01:48,684 --> 00:01:51,777
<i>I must really respect her.</i>

34
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,670
Do you want to see where I live?

35
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:54,738
Hell yeah.

36
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:56,949
Strap in.

37
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:59,526
I've never ridden
on a motorcycle...

38
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,770
before.

39
00:02:05,534 --> 00:02:07,184
You live here?

40
00:02:07,186 --> 00:02:09,035
It's adorable.

41
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:11,446
All I have to do is
ring this bell.

42
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:12,522
Ooh, 3:00 a.m.

43
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:15,192
Whoa, kind of loud!

44
00:02:15,194 --> 00:02:16,360
Don't you think?

45
00:02:16,362 --> 00:02:18,720
You look great, too, thanks!

46
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:21,198
Mmm.

47
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,716
All right, I've got to know,

48
00:02:22,718 --> 00:02:25,385
why did you guys move away
after fourth grade,

49
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:28,054
and then not tell anybody
where you were going?

50
00:02:28,056 --> 00:02:29,314
We had to get out.

51
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,891
Move somewhere that
people didn't see us

52
00:02:30,893 --> 00:02:35,136
- as the school bully and his poor stripper mom.
- Aw!

53
00:02:35,138 --> 00:02:37,489
<i>I punched my house goodbye...</i>

54
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,384
<i>and left for who-knows-where.</i>

55
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:41,827
<i>Okay, I've got to be honest,</i>

56
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,070
<i>your troubles are reeling me in.</i>

57
00:02:44,072 --> 00:02:46,814
All I need to hear is
one clumsy compliment,

58
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:48,316
and I'm hooked.

59
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,561
Uh... I bet you could bench 120.

60
00:02:51,563 --> 00:02:53,821
Aw, Nelson.

61
00:02:53,823 --> 00:02:58,235
I need you to know
I never saw you as just a bully.

62
00:02:58,237 --> 00:03:01,329
But I pounded so many dweebs.

63
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:04,332
Well, yeah, but to me,
you were a sweet,

64
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:08,020
lost little lamb
with blackout anger issues.

65
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:10,672
I confess,
my knees would buckle a little

66
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:14,084
"Haw-haw!"

67
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:17,345
- Haw-haw!
- Haw-haw!

68
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:19,031
Emphasis on the first haw.

69
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,608
Haw-haw! Haw-haw!

70
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,035
Haw-haw!

71
00:03:23,929 --> 00:03:25,871
Aw, nailed it.

72
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,498
Aw, look, the sun's coming up.

73
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,195
So, have you been
seeing anybody?

74
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:36,289
Of course.

75
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,291
You think I, Lisa Simpson,

76
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:40,052
could go through
four years of college

77
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,887
without a single date?

78
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,463
There's this amazing guy.

79
00:03:43,465 --> 00:03:47,284
Vegan but not, you know,
"vegan."

80
00:03:47,286 --> 00:03:50,729
Majors in pony studies.

81
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,898
Sounds perfect.
What's his name?

82
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,217
Um... Fred.

83
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:59,238
Fred Gormanshenlen.

84
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,799
Gorm... Grim...
Mm-hmm, Fred Gormanshenlen.

85
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:04,743
Hey, Lis,
still looking for a boyfriend?

86
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,654
Or a girlfriend?
Or a friend-friend?

87
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:09,823
Bart! Look, it's Nelson.

88
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:10,916
- Give me your lunch money.
- Ah!

89
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,976
Just kidding,
that's stupid kid stuff.

90
00:04:12,978 --> 00:04:15,328
Give me your rent money.
Also kidding.

91
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,814
But if you want to give me
some money, I'll take it.

92
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:19,407
Uh... okay.

93
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:21,760
Thanks, man.
That takes me back.

94
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,336
Mom and Dad wanted me
to tell you

95
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:24,671
we're taking you to breakfast.

96
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:26,523
Now I'll leave you two alone.

97
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,327
I know all you did was put on
an invisibility cloak.

98
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:34,189
Fine. I just wanted to see
what happens.

99
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:38,443
Sure is beautiful up here.

100
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:42,781
Remember that time we, like,
"liked" each other for a bit?

101
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:47,619
<i>Um, I'm not sure.</i>

102
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,604
<i>Maybe... Could be...</i>

103
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:51,606
<i>Uh...</i>

104
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:54,776
Nelson, do you think this
could be one of those moments

105
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:57,187
that changes your life forever?

106
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:59,523
Like finding a quarter
in a couch?

107
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:00,799
Even better.

108
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,951
Uh, hold that thought.
Duty calls.

109
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,974
It kind of ruins the moment!

110
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,959
Yeah, burritos are great!

111
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:14,146
Bart! Did you find Lisa?

112
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,889
She's up
there talking to the kid

113
00:05:15,891 --> 00:05:17,799
who used to beat me up
all the time.

114
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:19,967
The vest one or the hat one?

115
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:21,044
Vest.

116
00:05:21,046 --> 00:05:22,379
Always liked him.

117
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:23,897
Lisa, get down here!

118
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:27,326
You know they only let me out of
debtors' prison for half a day.

119
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,661
I thought selling my house
and one lung would be enough

120
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,998
to pay for college, but
it just paid for the meal plan.

121
00:05:35,577 --> 00:05:37,336
You better go.

122
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,745
Oh.

123
00:05:38,747 --> 00:05:40,488
I'll call you.

124
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,007
Great. Want to hear my ringtone?

125
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,125
It's really awesome.

126
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:50,832
The future is bright.

127
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:53,018
We go forth into a world

128
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,911
where we've reversed
global warming.

129
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,766
And now there is
a low-carb bread

130
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:02,586
that doesn't taste weird.

131
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,257
Congratulations, class of...

132
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,776
Toss up your caps,
and, starting this year,

133
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:13,372
they will come down as diplomas.

134
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:17,951
Art history?

135
00:06:17,953 --> 00:06:20,194
It was more valuable as a cap.

136
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:22,196
I'm so proud.

137
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:24,365
She's the first Simpson
who went to a college

138
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:27,794
who wasn't participating
in a sleep study.

139
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:30,389
You missed your sister's speech.

140
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:33,408
Ah, she's been rehearsing it
every night for 22 years.

141
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,894
"Follow your dreams,"
"carpe diem,"

142
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,897
sax solo,
Maya Angelou quote, out.

143
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:39,899
Nailed it.

144
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:51,559
Lisa, since you're moving
to the big city,

145
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:54,320
let me give you
some very important advice:

146
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:58,992
the police horses will not
share their oats.

147
00:06:58,994 --> 00:07:02,754
Not share their oats.

148
00:07:04,332 --> 00:07:06,240
Stop the car!

149
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:08,760
<i>I wonder what life
could be like.</i>

150
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,278
<i>Je t'aime.</i>

151
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,389
Hold that thought,
it's midnight.

152
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,330
When are we gonna get
a real apartment?

153
00:07:20,332 --> 00:07:22,757
We live in the best bell tower
in the world,

154
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,901
and you're still not happy.

155
00:07:25,837 --> 00:07:28,071
Nelson, it's still a bell tower.

156
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,845
I know what you're saying.
"This marriage is incredible.

157
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:38,198
No man compares to me.
I love you so much."

158
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,958
<i>Écoutez-moi!</i>

159
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,669
Huh?

160
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:53,513
Dad, please drive away
at a melancholy pace.

161
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,310
Good, and can you make it
look like it's raining?

162
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:02,355
That's perfect.

163
00:08:06,712 --> 00:08:09,212
<i>What am I
supposed to do? Narrate?</i>

164
00:08:09,214 --> 00:08:10,155
<i>What does that mean?</i>

165
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,806
<i>It's "S" years later.</i>

166
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:13,808
<i>Oh, wait, five years later.</i>

167
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,810
<i>Oh! Narrating is hard.</i>

168
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:18,997
<i>Lisa and Nelson have not
seen each other since college,</i>

169
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,501
<i>but five-uddenly,
I mean, but suddenly...</i>

170
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:29,508
Oh, sweetie, person of the year.

171
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,992
You look great.

172
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:32,159
I can't believe it didn't go

173
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:34,587
to President
"Clone of Abraham Lincoln."

174
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:37,164
<i>What have they done
to my Republican Party?</i>

175
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,850
<i>Even I think they're nuts.</i>

176
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:43,429
<i>But as long as they're cutting
education, I don't really care.</i>

177
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:45,932
But I'm innocent, okay?

178
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:48,601
I did not rob this train,
I swear.

179
00:08:48,603 --> 00:08:50,253
I'm simply here to try

180
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:52,922
one of those classic
Amtrak cheeseburgers.

181
00:08:52,924 --> 00:08:54,348
Super yum.

182
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,700
We've got proof.

183
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,929
There are 1,700 surveillance
cameras on this car alone.

184
00:08:59,931 --> 00:09:01,706
Fine. I admit it.

185
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,458
Guilty as charged.

186
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:08,529
Behold the awesome power
of the flying squirrel.

187
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:10,440
- Wha...?
- Gotcha.

188
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:13,385
Don't forget,
every squirrel has a tail.

189
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:17,389
Like, no!

190
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,893
Nelson Muntz?

191
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,728
Are you a police officer?

192
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,957
No way. No one wants to be
a lame-o cop these days.

193
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,793
Ah, shoot. Uh, Lou.

194
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:33,071
Can you fish around down there,
maybe find my seat belt?

195
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,407
Just let me die.

196
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,891
I'm a bounty hunter.

197
00:09:36,893 --> 00:09:40,561
This angel with zip cuffs is
the love of my life, Rott.

198
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:42,305
Short for Rottweiler.

199
00:09:42,307 --> 00:09:44,824
Lisa's a friend
from Springfield Elementary.

200
00:09:44,826 --> 00:09:48,253
Remember that principal
we arrested for matricide?

201
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,072
Skinner killed his mother?

202
00:09:51,074 --> 00:09:53,925
No, mattress-cide.

203
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:57,012
He ripped the tag
off his mattress.

204
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,226
Your sleep number is up.

205
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,997
Nelson,
I haven't seen you since...

206
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,333
that night at college.

207
00:10:10,335 --> 00:10:12,593
Uh, what night at college?

208
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:14,838
It was nothing, just
another one of those evenings

209
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,617
where you stay out all night
and watch the sunset

210
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,452
and hear a few bells.

211
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:24,956
Hubert Wong,
visionary tech giant.

212
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,275
Your hand feels as soft
as a baby's bottom.

213
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:30,703
And yours feels
like a busted driveway.

214
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:31,871
Thank you.

215
00:10:31,873 --> 00:10:33,206
So, Hubert, what's up?

216
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,800
I have been waiting for
this day since second grade

217
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,543
when you used to bully me.

218
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:39,879
Those who laugh last,
laugh best.

219
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,644
And now I have won the prize
your heart desired most of all.

220
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,871
That luggage rack behind Lisa?

221
00:10:47,873 --> 00:10:49,463
No, Lisa.

222
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:51,724
Do you know
where I proposed to her?

223
00:10:51,726 --> 00:10:53,877
I don't know. Chipotle?

224
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,471
Hubert proposed on the moon.

225
00:10:57,473 --> 00:11:01,660
<i>He took me to the Sea
of Tranquility at earthrise,</i>

226
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,278
<i>and I saw "Marry Me"</i>

227
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,166
<i>written in the sands
of the Sahara Desert.</i>

228
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,002
<i>Bo-ring.</i>

229
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,987
<i>In space suits,
you can't even kiss.</i>

230
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:17,550
<i>I spent $20 million
designing suits where you could.</i>

231
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:23,848
<i>Holy crap.</i>

232
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,499
That story sucked.

233
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:28,878
Nelson and I have a love so hot,
it'll melt your damn skull.

234
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,524
- Ah!
- - We met when I hauled his fat carcass in

235
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,692
for the reward.

236
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,601
I had an overdue library book.

237
00:11:35,603 --> 00:11:39,197
"new ants"?

238
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,516
Nuance! Nuance! Love you.

239
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:44,577
Aw! Mm!

240
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,521
Ugh, I need a drink.

241
00:11:47,523 --> 00:11:49,782
I could go for
a scotch and steroids.

242
00:11:49,784 --> 00:11:51,042
Oh, funny.

243
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,044
Lisa never told me
she had a thing for you.

244
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,954
Well, not really. In a way.

245
00:11:54,956 --> 00:11:57,440
Sort of. Maybe.
I don't know. Shut up.

246
00:11:57,442 --> 00:11:59,625
Tell me, Nelson,
how is your mother?

247
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:01,461
What was her job again?

248
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:05,465
I believe some sort of
freelance entertainer? Hmm?

249
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:08,952
- Stripper.
- Ah, yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes.

250
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:10,787
And your father,
is he still living

251
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:13,122
with his secret other family
in Shelbyville?

252
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:14,974
Huh? Is he? Is he?

253
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:17,694
We were the secret family,
idiot.

254
00:12:18,813 --> 00:12:21,722
He wedgied me!

255
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:24,892
My "person of the year" status
didn't protect me at all!

256
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:27,804
Nelson, you're an adult,

257
00:12:27,806 --> 00:12:29,748
and you still do this?

258
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,324
Not cool, dude.

259
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:33,309
I mean, you can shake off
a punch to the face,

260
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:35,920
but those underpants are
stretched forever, man.

261
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:40,925
Nelson, I really thought that
by this time that...

262
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,969
You never learn.

263
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,265
Love is so fickle.

264
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,086
Lou, can you jam my butt
into this bathroom?

265
00:12:52,088 --> 00:12:53,438
Oh, man.

266
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,016
<i>Five years later.</i>

267
00:12:57,018 --> 00:12:58,976
<i>Why do I have to say it again?</i>

268
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,095
<i>Couldn't you use
the one I said last time?</i>

269
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:04,674
<i>And I asked for a 3 Musketeers
about an hour ago.</i>

270
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,788
<i>Ah, good
but a little disappointing.</i>

271
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,122
Looking for a phone?

272
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,941
I recommend the one
that attaches to your brainstem.

273
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:17,203
Nelson. Hi.

274
00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:20,690
Minimally invasive surgery
and updates you barely notice.

275
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,711
So, listen, sorry about
what I did to Hubert.

276
00:13:25,713 --> 00:13:26,971
How're you two doing?

277
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,865
Great. Great.

278
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,366
Great.

279
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:33,052
You know,
his company is doing fantastic.

280
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:40,151
<i>The new ePhone 67 enables users
to actually meld their minds.</i>

281
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,879
<i>Experience intimate contact
with your loved ones</i>

282
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:44,881
<i>with a minimum of pop-up ads.</i>

283
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:46,140
<i>And most importantly,</i>

284
00:13:46,142 --> 00:13:47,975
<i>we care about our workers.</i>

285
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,235
<i>Thanks to this innovation,</i>

286
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:52,831
we're finally able to
pay them $16 an hour.

287
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,833
In store credit.

288
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,060
How are you and Rott?

289
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:59,003
We're great. We're good.

290
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,989
Not that good. She left me.

291
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:04,734
Here's a little fact
to put in your mind.

292
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:07,086
Hubert and I are separated, too.

293
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:09,422
<i>Achieved.</i>

294
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:11,924
<i>Time to go to the next level.</i>

295
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,578
Coffee!

296
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,300
We just want coffee!

297
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,674
<i>I should never have left
my home planet.</i>

298
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:23,510
<i>Today's temperature
is 50 below zero.</i>

299
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:25,530
<i>Would you like to order mittens?</i>

300
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,351
So, my ex and I split up
because of a fight,

301
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:33,204
a fight she had at a fight club
without telling me.

302
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,599
Ugh, there's nothing worse
than dishonest punching.

303
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:38,543
But enough talking about
other women.

304
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,713
Lisa, I'm tired of only
seeing you every five years.

305
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:46,626
I'd like to see you
every three years or two or...

306
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:49,295
or... on a weekly basis!

307
00:14:49,297 --> 00:14:51,372
Nelson Muntz,
I would really like

308
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:53,975
to get to know you better, too.

309
00:15:23,314 --> 00:15:25,006
What about Milhouse?

310
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:29,318
If I'm a simulation,
why am I so lonely?

311
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,596
Who does that benefit?

312
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:36,159
Lisa! Lisa!

313
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:38,661
Uh, wait a minute.

314
00:15:38,663 --> 00:15:40,271
- I want you back.
- No.

315
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,153
Lisa, through the miracle
of constant repeated

316
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,947
electroshock therapy,
I've fixed everything

317
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,114
about myself, and now I am good.

318
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:53,192
I am great.
I am awesomeness itself.

319
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:55,662
Oh, attitude reset.

320
00:15:59,184 --> 00:16:00,941
Take me back. Please.

321
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:02,276
See, I say please now.

322
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:03,777
You want me to beg?

323
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:04,870
This guy begs.

324
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:08,115
I don't know. Why should I?

325
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:09,783
Why don't you look outside?

326
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,293
You can run
my charitable foundation.

327
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:21,037
You can save the planet.

328
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,964
All the dreams you laid out
in this second-grade paper.

329
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:27,134
You kept that this whole time?

330
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:29,562
Oh, no, what do I do now?

331
00:16:29,564 --> 00:16:32,398
Um... um...

332
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,976
They say if you love something,
let it go.

333
00:16:35,978 --> 00:16:38,237
And if it loves you,
it'll come back.

334
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:42,725
Ex-Except for your turtle which
got smushed by that mail truck.

335
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:44,393
Follow your dreams, Lisa.

336
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:47,321
Like you said
in your graduation speech.

337
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:49,899
You remember my speech!

338
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:51,009
Aw!

339
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,085
He remembered one line.

340
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:54,846
I have it all.

341
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:59,666
Hubert, this is a side of you
I've never seen.

342
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:01,519
Goodbye, Nelson.

343
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:06,024
You idiot.

344
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,085
Woah, those really hurt.

345
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:10,862
<i>Four months later.</i>

346
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,346
<i>Wait, that wasn't the end?</i>

347
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:13,923
<i>She doesn't end up with Hubert?</i>

348
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:15,867
<i>Oh, wait, oh, I see.</i>

349
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,684
<i>There's still another page here.</i>

350
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:20,204
<i>Okay. Lisa and Nelson get
a phone call.</i>

351
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,540
<i>Their best friends
are getting married.</i>

352
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,024
<i>The bully with the hat</i>

353
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:26,044
<i>and Krusty's daughter.</i>

354
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,028
And why am I doing this?
Am I dead?

355
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,422
I hope not.

356
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,960
Hello?

357
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:36,370
- Will you be my maid of honor?
- Will you be my best man?

358
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:37,630
-I can't believe
-I can't believe

359
00:17:37,632 --> 00:17:38,948
- how much I love him.
- How much I love her.

360
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,949
Oh, how are you?

361
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:41,542
- Meh.
- Same old, same old.

362
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:42,968
Blah, blah, blah.

363
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,229
I just hope you
find the happiness I have.

364
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,399
It's so great
when severely damaged people,

365
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,051
like all of us, find each other.

366
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:53,129
So, can I count on you?

367
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:55,055
Sure.

368
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:57,241
- She's so lucky.
- He's so lucky.

369
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,227
I don't have a dog.

370
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:02,163
I got to fix that screen door.

371
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,479
So, Sophie and Jimbo.

372
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:12,832
I guess
some people have happy endings.

373
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:16,669
Come on, Lisa. Use the crook
of your arm, not the forearm.

374
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:19,079
No one ever taught you
how to interlock arms?

375
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:21,099
I know you're not really angry.

376
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,434
I know what this is
really about.

377
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,995
Just because you know everything
and I know nothing

378
00:18:25,997 --> 00:18:28,164
doesn't make you
smarter than me.

379
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,832
Well, maybe it does a little.

380
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:35,004
You told me to go,
and now you're mad I did.

381
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:37,506
You haven't changed
since elementary school.

382
00:18:37,508 --> 00:18:40,267
Nobody changes
after elementary school.

383
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:42,787
The church is eating me.

384
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,272
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.

385
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:47,350
And thanks to
this hologram of my father

386
00:18:47,352 --> 00:18:50,461
who's about to perform this
beautiful interfaith ceremony.

387
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,372
My son, you are
a big needy nothing.

388
00:18:53,374 --> 00:18:56,692
Aw, his speech
from my bar mitzvah.

389
00:18:56,694 --> 00:18:58,210
That always gets me.

390
00:18:58,212 --> 00:19:00,880
People ask me, "Why Jimbo?"

391
00:19:00,882 --> 00:19:04,200
And I say, "Screw you,
mind your own business, Mom."

392
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:05,459
But there's more.

393
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:06,477
He's honest.

394
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,312
He doesn't hide
who he really is,

395
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,706
and there's no one
I could be more in love with.

396
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,209
<i>Have I been missing it
the whole time?</i>

397
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:14,894
<i>Is Nelson the one?</i>

398
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:17,697
<i>No. You love Hubert.</i>

399
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:26,622
You are the smartest, sweetest,
funniest person I've ever met.

400
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:30,042
Eh, I'll never have a life.

401
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,486
Nelson.

402
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:34,063
They're bailing!

403
00:19:34,065 --> 00:19:35,731
Thank God I had understudies.

404
00:19:41,406 --> 00:19:42,663
What are you doing out here?

405
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:45,516
You'll catch cold.
Come on, take my jacket.

406
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:49,020
Why did you follow me?

407
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,097
I followed you
because I adore you.

408
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:53,933
Lisa, I used to know
what it was like

409
00:19:53,935 --> 00:19:56,027
to hurt a person for no reason.

410
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,920
Don't do it to me.

411
00:19:57,922 --> 00:19:59,605
I couldn't be more serious.

412
00:19:59,607 --> 00:20:02,200
<i>I love you
because you're the last person</i>

413
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,426
<i>I want to talk to at night.</i>

414
00:20:03,428 --> 00:20:06,687
<i>When you say "Smell you later,"</i>

415
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:08,264
<i>I do want to smell you later.</i>

416
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:10,449
<i>Wherever I've gone in my life,</i>

417
00:20:10,451 --> 00:20:13,285
<i>I'm drawn back to you
like a dork's face to a swirly.</i>

418
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:15,771
<i>And when I get all wrapped up
in my feelings,</i>

419
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:19,275
<i>you're the one who tells me
feelings are dumb.</i>

420
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:21,277
But they are dumb,
if you throw away everything

421
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,796
for a loser in a clip-on tie.

422
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:25,798
I'll tell you what I want,
mister.

423
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,642
Haw... Huh?

424
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:34,232
I lost the girl,
but I got the bell.

425
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,897
So, I was doing a panel at CPAC,

426
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:52,808
the Clone Political
Action Committee.

427
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,993
Not the other one, they suck.

428
00:20:53,995 --> 00:20:56,254
And I saw
the tallest drink of water

429
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,980
I'd ever seen in my life.

430
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,833
I looked at him and said,
"There's a man

431
00:21:00,835 --> 00:21:02,318
I'd like to share a bed with."

432
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,170
That was a thing
in my day. It was!

433
00:21:05,172 --> 00:21:07,265
Then I found out he was an actor

434
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,325
and, uh, boy,
that was a red flag.

435
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:12,085
Well, yes, but now
we've been running mates

436
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:13,771
for four straight terms.

437
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,164
Didn't hurt that we were running

438
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,666
against Jimmy Carter
and Grover Cleveland.

439
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:20,927
Oh, we'll be back.

440
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:23,764
Between my malaise
and his mugwumps, we can't lose.

441
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:29,453
Shh!

442
00:21:29,477 --> 00:21:31,477
