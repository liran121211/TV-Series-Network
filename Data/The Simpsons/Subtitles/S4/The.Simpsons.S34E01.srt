4
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:27,907
So, all in favor
of the city of Springfield

5
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:29,829
no longer celebrating
Columbus Day

6
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:33,141
due to the problematic behavior
of Christopher Columbus?

7
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:34,313
Aye.

8
00:00:34,398 --> 00:00:36,641
All opposed?

9
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:40,071
Now I'll hand it over to
the terrifyingly engaged citizen

10
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:43,312
who has had her hand up
since before the meeting began,

11
00:00:43,397 --> 00:00:45,148
Helen Love joy.

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,321
I've noticed lately that people
have been putting up

13
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:52,009
quite a few little DIY
free libraries

14
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,178
all over town.

15
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,476
What's DIY stand for?

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,031
Do it yourself.

17
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,195
I'm trying to but I can't.

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,424
Just this past week,
six new ones popped up.

19
00:01:02,634 --> 00:01:04,085
Hallelujah!

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,929
Think about the consequences,
people.

21
00:01:06,014 --> 00:01:07,022
Free books?

22
00:01:07,107 --> 00:01:08,960
What if one of them
is the<i> Kama Sutra?</i>

23
00:01:09,045 --> 00:01:11,695
That's just bait
for learned perverts.

24
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:15,140
There is no classical art
without<i> the erotic.</i>

25
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:17,310
- Ew.
- You and me got to hang sometime.

26
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:19,202
I like those little libraries.

27
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:20,671
Unlike the public school
library,

28
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,265
these have books
written after 1945.

29
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,126
The children think Iceland
is still a kingdom.

30
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,900
Oh, these abominations
don't follow the rules

31
00:01:27,984 --> 00:01:29,643
of my neighborhood association.

32
00:01:29,727 --> 00:01:32,813
What if someone paints it
an unauthorized shade of white?

33
00:01:32,897 --> 00:01:34,593
Like Swiss coffee.

34
00:01:37,023 --> 00:01:38,693
Homer Simpson here.

35
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:41,897
Today I'm standing, even
in the presence of a chair,

36
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:43,868
to say what if we took

37
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:45,860
all the little free book huts

38
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:48,788
and moved them
into one big building

39
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:50,974
open to everybody?

40
00:01:51,342 --> 00:01:54,018
Do you mean like... a library?

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,515
- He's so slow.
- Nothing upstairs.

42
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:02,767
- Aw, what a dummy.
<i>- Idiot a.</i>

43
00:02:03,594 --> 00:02:06,105
Am I really a stupid man?

44
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:08,359
I... Well, uh...

45
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:11,312
Sorry, reflections can't talk.
Got to go.

46
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:18,601
You guys say ideas
all the time.

47
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:21,120
The one time I say one
they shoot me down,

48
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:23,610
just like they shot down
the<i> Titanic.</i>

49
00:02:23,695 --> 00:02:25,899
Actually, the<i> Titanic...</i>

50
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,551
Face it, Marge,

51
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:29,711
you're married to a dummy.

52
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:33,115
No, a dum-dum.

53
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,882
Oh, this big, beautiful head
is full of great ideas

54
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:38,885
just waiting to be set free.

55
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:41,140
I might be okay
if you do that

56
00:02:41,224 --> 00:02:43,045
for the rest of my life.

57
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,148
I know just the place that will
make you feel better.

58
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,415
Did you see how
the credit card thing

59
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,782
at the ticket booth
told me to remove my card,

60
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:54,532
like I didn't know
how to do it?

61
00:02:54,617 --> 00:02:57,915
Then it got stuck 'cause
I didn't know how to do it.

62
00:02:57,999 --> 00:02:59,860
Let's just go home.

63
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:02,235
We haven't even
seen any animals yet.

64
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:05,696
So? Even the animals
will think I'm dumb.

65
00:03:05,781 --> 00:03:07,258
Oh, don't be silly.

66
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,837
That's just the sound
hyenas make.

67
00:03:16,332 --> 00:03:17,813
Slow Leonard?

68
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,039
I've always loved
that tortoise.

69
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:22,848
I can't believe
Leonard is still alive.

70
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:24,772
The mighty tortoise.

71
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,961
Dumber than me.
Loser to the hare.

72
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:30,586
The tortoise famously
wins that race.

73
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:33,243
Really?
I only read the beginning

74
00:03:33,328 --> 00:03:34,805
of that story really fast.

75
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,528
Then I got tired
and took a nap.

76
00:03:36,612 --> 00:03:38,648
I don't see any tortoise.

77
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:44,127
Excuse me, do you know
what happened to Leonard?

78
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:46,617
Leonard? Huh.
I don't see him.

79
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,173
That's weird. Well,
the thing about a tortoise is

80
00:03:49,258 --> 00:03:50,648
they're always somewhere.

81
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,187
He must have gotten out.
Who's in charge here?

82
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:55,397
I am the director of the zoo.

83
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:56,922
Would you like a koala sticker?

84
00:03:57,007 --> 00:04:00,266
Yes, I would.
Slow Leonard is missing.

85
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:02,221
Now, let's not panic, sir.

86
00:04:02,305 --> 00:04:04,422
I don't see him either,
but I'm sure

87
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:05,724
there's some explanation.

88
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:07,043
We'll look into it.

89
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:08,415
Look into it?

90
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,488
I know when I'm being
talked down to.

91
00:04:10,572 --> 00:04:12,806
- You think I'm dumb, don't you?
- No,

92
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,055
I don't, but do you
have a degree in zoology?

93
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,415
No, but I've seen
the comedy classic<i> Zookeeper</i>

94
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,726
- 19 times.
- I love that movie.

95
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:23,166
I don't need your approval,

96
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:25,696
and neither does
Sylvester Stallone,

97
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:28,703
as the voice of Joe,
the African lion.

98
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:31,461
A tortoise is missing,

99
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:33,774
and this dumb guy

100
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:36,453
is gonna find him.

101
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:43,963
There we go.
A recent picture.

102
00:04:45,426 --> 00:04:47,657
Mom, it's late, I'm worried.

103
00:04:47,742 --> 00:04:50,368
Why isn't Dad at Moe's?
Is Moe all right?

104
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:53,219
He's fine. Your dad's
been looking for clues

105
00:04:53,304 --> 00:04:55,367
in those zoo pictures
all night.

106
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:59,187
Come on, buddy, you're
smart enough to crack this.

107
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:01,196
Dolly tire tracks.

108
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:03,852
I bet someone used a dolly
to cart Leonard off.

109
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:07,469
And those treads are clearly
from a Haul-Pro convertible

110
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:09,922
with a weight cap
of 500 pounds.

111
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:12,446
Wow, Dad, how did you
figure that out?

112
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:14,587
Eh, yep, well,
your dad knows

113
00:05:14,672 --> 00:05:17,407
a thing or two about dollies.

114
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:20,651
Drive safe, ya bum.

115
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:23,727
I think you'll find
these photos

116
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:27,413
more than enough proof to open
a missing turtle investigation.

117
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:28,711
Wow, Homer, you're right.

118
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:31,422
These photos are
incredible evidence.

119
00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:34,124
- Really?
- Evidence of how dumb you are.

120
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:36,281
I just love it when
regular people think

121
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:37,915
they can solve crimes.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,601
It's like a dog thinking
he can mow the lawn.

123
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:44,422
- Aw.
- Look at...

124
00:05:44,507 --> 00:05:45,640
Hey.

125
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:49,116
No one takes me seriously.

126
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,022
You know, there's a lot
of specific interest groups

127
00:05:52,116 --> 00:05:53,023
on Face look.

128
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:54,858
I'm in one about
knitting mug cozies

129
00:05:54,942 --> 00:05:57,602
with a little window so you can
read the funny message

130
00:05:57,686 --> 00:05:59,065
on the mug.

131
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,348
Why don't you check
to see if there's a group

132
00:06:01,432 --> 00:06:02,814
about Leonard's case?

133
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:06,095
Social media?
Is that website still on?

134
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:09,298
Hey, there is a missing
tortoise group here.

135
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:11,783
It's called Lost Leonard!

136
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,028
But what if they say
I'm stupid

137
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:15,696
or drag me in the comments?

138
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,807
Do you know how scary it is
in this climate

139
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:19,291
to be a dumb white man?

140
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,104
You care about that turtle.

141
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,502
I think you'll feel better
if you try.

142
00:06:23,587 --> 00:06:26,002
The police don't believe me,

143
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:28,881
but I'm posting some photos
that I think prove

144
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:31,556
that Slow Leonard
has been kidnapped.

145
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:38,267
Dad, they're agreeing
with you.

146
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:40,327
They think Leonard
was stolen, too.

147
00:06:40,412 --> 00:06:41,830
Really? Oh, my God.

148
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:43,648
A group of anonymous
cyber sleuths

149
00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:45,150
don't think I'm an idiot.

150
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:46,657
They like what I said.

151
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:50,478
That tickles.

152
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:53,150
The Internet thinks I'm smart.

153
00:06:57,246 --> 00:06:59,515
Okay, this is Homer S.
live streaming

154
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,244
to the Lost Leonard
Face look group

155
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:03,976
from the scene of the crime.
Are we all on?

156
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:09,549
How convenient.

157
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:11,360
They're replacing Leonard
with a much more

158
00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:12,862
Instagrammable animal.

159
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:15,606
One that can fit
into baby clothes.

160
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,425
Maybe we have our motive.

161
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:20,519
- Of course.
- Brilliant.

162
00:07:20,603 --> 00:07:23,346
Thanks, guys.
I do what I can,

163
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:24,782
which is a lot.

164
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:26,858
Look at this, dream team.

165
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:30,120
A video doorbell
across the street from the zoo.

166
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:32,030
How convenient.

167
00:07:32,324 --> 00:07:35,051
Oh. It's actually
very convenient.

168
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:38,509
Simpson, what can
I do for you?

169
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:41,310
For us. I don't know if you've
heard the terrible news

170
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,300
that Slow Leonard
has been kidnapped.

171
00:07:43,384 --> 00:07:44,952
What?! Not Leonard.

172
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:47,212
Why couldn't they have taken
one of those damn

173
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:49,139
barking seals instead?

174
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:52,816
When do you monsters sleep?!

175
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:55,706
I'm a member of a team
of cyber sleuths

176
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,846
searching for Leonard.

177
00:07:56,931 --> 00:07:58,723
Can we look at your
door camera footage?

178
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:00,484
Oh, of course. And, um,

179
00:08:00,568 --> 00:08:01,969
I'd love to join the group.

180
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,396
But, uh, you guys
probably already have,

181
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,248
uh, a superintendent.

182
00:08:06,463 --> 00:08:09,697
We do now.

183
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:11,659
<i>Marge. Marge.</i>

184
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,775
Marge, fan out those
cocktail napkins.

185
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:17,307
Or did you not watch
the TikTok I sent you?

186
00:08:17,392 --> 00:08:19,128
Calm down.

187
00:08:19,213 --> 00:08:20,878
I've never seen you
this excited

188
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:22,151
for a meet and greet.

189
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,635
Yeah, so who's coming
to this thing again?

190
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,826
Internet randos?

191
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:27,682
Let me tell you something, son.

192
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:30,664
Every human being
is born an Internet ran do.

193
00:08:30,748 --> 00:08:32,573
And then they stay
Internet randos

194
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:34,456
until they connect
over a cause.

195
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,417
And then and only then
do they achieve

196
00:08:36,502 --> 00:08:40,611
their full potential
and become not random.

197
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:42,682
Dad, is that really...

198
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:44,635
Duh, yes. Paella.

199
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,112
What do you think all this
toasted saffron is for?

200
00:08:47,197 --> 00:08:48,932
You've never
toasted us anything.

201
00:08:49,017 --> 00:08:50,354
Not even toast.

202
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:52,487
I don't need to show off
for you, Marge.

203
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:53,953
You already bought the cow.

204
00:08:54,037 --> 00:08:56,548
I finally have a group
of friends who think I'm smart.

205
00:08:56,632 --> 00:08:58,589
Who haven't used
a skeptical emoji

206
00:08:58,674 --> 00:09:00,887
with a monocle
even once with me.

207
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:02,949
They're here.

208
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:04,631
Keep stirring gently, slow.

209
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:07,463
Like stirring a baby.

210
00:09:08,144 --> 00:09:09,667
Thanks for hosting, Homer.

211
00:09:09,752 --> 00:09:11,939
I would have,
but my infinity pool broke.

212
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:13,597
Its edge is now finite.

213
00:09:13,682 --> 00:09:16,527
I'm up to my eyeballs
in contractors and physicists.

214
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:20,338
Come in. Oh, you all look
so much like your avatars.

215
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,495
I got paella, of course,
a big-screen TV

216
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,018
for viewing
surveillance footage,

217
00:09:25,102 --> 00:09:26,299
an evidence board

218
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:28,081
and, of course,
yarn for connecting

219
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,338
our seemingly unrelated photos.

220
00:09:30,423 --> 00:09:33,647
Um, is this genuine
Mrs. McClellan's Evidence Yarn?

221
00:09:33,732 --> 00:09:34,908
<i>Fancy.</i>

222
00:09:34,993 --> 00:09:37,956
Why, yes, it is.
Illuminati strength.

223
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,158
Nine out of ten scientists
are afraid of it.

224
00:09:42,803 --> 00:09:46,464
I'd like to thank Homer
for this extraordinary paella.

225
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:50,665
My mouth would swear
it is in Barcelona.

226
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:01,689
Hey, uh, uh,
not to go down a rabbit hole,

227
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:03,449
but this plot could go deep,

228
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:05,916
and the one person
we haven't looked at yet

229
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:07,919
is the zoo director.

230
00:10:08,047 --> 00:10:10,471
The zoo director. Um, Gil,

231
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:13,259
- isn't that a little desperate?
- Hold it.

232
00:10:13,392 --> 00:10:16,235
There's one thing you need to
know about this paella party.

233
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:18,345
There are no bad ideas.

234
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,591
Nothing said here is stupid.

235
00:10:20,676 --> 00:10:21,676
Mm-hmm.

236
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,652
- Mm...
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

237
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:25,254
Oh, then I want to say
I agree with Gil

238
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:28,506
about the zoo director.
We should board it.

239
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,326
Has anybody dug through
the tortoise scat yet?

240
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,931
Maybe he was being used
as a drug mule.

241
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:35,325
Board it.

242
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,909
Perhaps Leonard's seed
was required by scientists

243
00:10:38,994 --> 00:10:40,924
who want to breed
slower horses.

244
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:42,401
- Uh, board it!
- Board it!

245
00:10:42,564 --> 00:10:44,740
Uh, h-hey...

246
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:46,283
how about that?

247
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:49,344
The yarn knows something
we're still figuring out.

248
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,057
We're gonna find this turtle,

249
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:53,924
but damn it,
we found love along the way.

250
00:10:54,018 --> 00:10:57,535
Oh, oh! What if the turtle
was taken by a billionaire

251
00:10:57,619 --> 00:11:00,307
to transfuse his blood
for longevity?

252
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:01,534
Board it.

253
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,003
Mom, are we worried

254
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:06,588
this group is crossing into
the conspiracy theory zone?

255
00:11:06,673 --> 00:11:09,788
Mmm, as long as he's got
a heavy hand with the saffron,

256
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:10,866
who cares?

257
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,643
Well, these people are finally

258
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:14,554
taking your father seriously.

259
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:16,120
He's not used to that.

260
00:11:16,205 --> 00:11:17,965
Bart, you're always
telling him

261
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:19,307
his ideas are dumb.

262
00:11:19,392 --> 00:11:21,830
And, Lisa, you're always
proving it.

263
00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:24,488
He deserves a chance
to be a big fish

264
00:11:24,572 --> 00:11:25,897
in a small, weird pond.

265
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:27,518
So let him have this.

266
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,111
It's all harmless enough.

267
00:11:29,212 --> 00:11:30,718
So it's decided.

268
00:11:30,803 --> 00:11:33,813
We're protesting in front
of the zoo director's house.

269
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:37,487
I shall bring the milk
in case they tear gas us.

270
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,985
Mm...

271
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:40,862
We can't be more emphatic,

272
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:43,156
we think Leonard's
in your attic.

273
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,854
Please stop these protests.

274
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:46,690
Why would I kidnap an animal?

275
00:11:46,775 --> 00:11:48,025
That's what a zoo is:

276
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,145
a bunch of kidnapped animals.

277
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,939
It's the cops!

278
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:57,409
If you're gonna pepper spray me,
do it fast.

279
00:11:57,555 --> 00:11:59,322
I don't have much
phone battery left.

280
00:11:59,447 --> 00:12:02,205
Calm down, I'm not here
as Police Chief Wiggum.

281
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,025
I'm here as Clancy Wiggum,
a simple civilian

282
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,878
hungry for turtle justice.

283
00:12:06,963 --> 00:12:08,566
Justice you'll never get from

284
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:10,729
a cold, faceless
police department.

285
00:12:10,837 --> 00:12:12,807
Uh-oh, body camera's on.

286
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:15,106
Don't worry, I can erase it
with a paper clip.

287
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:17,283
They, uh, they taught us how.

288
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:19,182
I need to say something
to a woman

289
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:20,815
I'm very much in love with.

290
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,818
Lizzie, before
this group started,

291
00:12:22,903 --> 00:12:26,247
I was in a shell
of my own making.

292
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:27,712
Oh, my God.

293
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:30,198
So I'm poking my head out
and asking

294
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:32,038
in front of our
new best friends,

295
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:34,632
will you make me
the happiest man

296
00:12:34,716 --> 00:12:36,475
on this flat earth?

297
00:12:37,478 --> 00:12:39,069
Yes, yes.

298
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:40,898
I can't wait to spend
the rest of my life

299
00:12:40,983 --> 00:12:42,974
taping together
shredded documents with you.

300
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,402
- Hooray.
- Aw.

301
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:47,437
Sure, the wedding planning
is a lot of work,

302
00:12:47,522 --> 00:12:50,833
but the group is also learning
how to sweep for spyware

303
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:52,168
and pick locks.

304
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:55,689
That's why all our doorknobs
are in that basket.

305
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:59,731
Homie, I wonder
if your cabal's ideas

306
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:01,918
are getting maybe a little

307
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:03,920
too far out of the box?

308
00:13:04,004 --> 00:13:05,255
Thank you, Marge.

309
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:06,906
You know what's inside boxes?

310
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,167
Styrofoam peanuts and lies.

311
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:11,336
And I'm tired of being fed both.

312
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,929
The beauty of this
group is that -Hmm?

313
00:13:13,013 --> 00:13:15,098
We always support each other.
There isn't one theory -Hmm...

314
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:16,841
- about Leonard that's right.
- Mm.

315
00:13:16,925 --> 00:13:19,344
They're all right.
He could be anywhere.

316
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:21,830
- Like the kitchen?
- Exactly.

317
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:25,266
No, he's literally
in the kitchen.

318
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:27,563
Homer,

319
00:13:27,648 --> 00:13:30,190
did you kidnap Leonard?

320
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:35,026
No, I didn't commit the crime.

321
00:13:35,117 --> 00:13:37,084
I did something much worse.

322
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:39,788
I solved it.

323
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:48,587
Why the hell
is Slow Leonard in our house?

324
00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:50,283
Do I have to tell you?

325
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:52,694
Can't we just accept this
as the new normal?

326
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:56,531
There's a 500-pound tortoise
chewing on my kitchen table.

327
00:13:56,615 --> 00:13:58,033
It's not normal.

328
00:13:58,117 --> 00:14:00,035
Okay, here goes.

329
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:01,369
After our protest,

330
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:03,814
<i>I went back
to the tortoise enclosure</i>

331
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:06,017
<i>for one last look.</i>

332
00:14:06,117 --> 00:14:07,275
Huh?

333
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,853
My doughnut hole!

334
00:14:11,388 --> 00:14:13,731
Ooh, ooh! Aah! Ow, ow!

335
00:14:13,815 --> 00:14:15,325
Mm?

336
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:17,820
<i>That's when I discovered
a doughnut hole</i>

337
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:19,737
<i>will always return
to its mother</i>

338
00:14:19,913 --> 00:14:21,832
<i>a larger hole.</i>

339
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,022
Leonard. You weren't kidnapped.

340
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:27,003
You were right here all along.

341
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:30,231
Wait, so after following
all those crazy leads,

342
00:14:30,315 --> 00:14:33,918
you found Leonard by going down
an actual rabbit hole?

343
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:36,959
- Yeah, so?
- Don't you see the irony?

344
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,459
Oh, now I don't get it.

345
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:41,581
Anyway...

346
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,521
Guys, you'll never believe it,
but I found...

347
00:14:44,605 --> 00:14:45,689
Just hold that thought.

348
00:14:45,773 --> 00:14:48,841
I made us all evidence
collection fanny packs.

349
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:52,087
Which we'll all wear
on the pedal bus pub crawl.

350
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,441
Are you coming, Homer?

351
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,683
There's a guac trough
in the middle.

352
00:14:56,692 --> 00:15:00,019
<i>If I told 'em I found
him, the group would end.</i>

353
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:01,872
How could I let that happen?

354
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:06,027
Those friendless weirdos have
become my best weird friends.

355
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:08,603
They're the only people
who don't say "Einstein"

356
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:11,197
after "great idea,"
or "Sherlock" after...

357
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:14,200
Oh, you have to
tell them the truth.

358
00:15:14,284 --> 00:15:16,558
Well, the truth
is different these days.

359
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:18,871
It's more of a hunch
you're willing to die for.

360
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:20,298
No, it's not!

361
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:22,871
But tomorrow Gil and
Miss Hoover are getting married

362
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,210
on Chem Trail Island,

363
00:15:24,294 --> 00:15:26,379
and we're all going to wear
matching head shields

364
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,790
so that Bluetooth can't steal
winning lottery numbers

365
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:30,141
from our brains.

366
00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:32,051
Homer, you solved the mystery.

367
00:15:32,135 --> 00:15:35,372
This confederacy of nutsos
has gone too far.

368
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,240
You're all acting dumb.

369
00:15:37,325 --> 00:15:38,926
Dumb.

370
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:40,969
You think I'm dumb, Marge?

371
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:42,552
Just like everyone
at the library

372
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:45,482
and all the other
smartypantseseseses

373
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:46,899
in this town?

374
00:15:46,983 --> 00:15:49,888
Well, you can't shame me into
turning my back on my people.

375
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:52,551
I'm going to that
conspiracy-themed wedding.

376
00:15:52,636 --> 00:15:54,583
And you're no longer
my plus-one,

377
00:15:54,817 --> 00:15:57,373
which is your loss
because I'm at a great table.

378
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:01,005
Equidistant from the bar

a turtle-stealing plot,

388
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:37,300
also uncovered an undying love.

389
00:16:37,384 --> 00:16:38,969
Aw.

390
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:40,470
Yeah, I, too, have a toast.

391
00:16:40,554 --> 00:16:43,139
To us bringing to justice
the zoo director,

392
00:16:43,223 --> 00:16:45,033
who knows where that turtle is.

393
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:46,977
Who's got ideas?

394
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:49,312
Remember, this is a safe space

395
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:52,040
for all dangerous
and violent plans.

396
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:54,684
Easy. We dump a swarm
of murder hornets

397
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:56,824
- down her chimney.
- Uh... - Board it!

398
00:16:56,909 --> 00:16:58,668
I can stuff a couple
of bricks of cocaine

399
00:16:58,753 --> 00:17:01,051
- in her wheel well.
- Board it.

400
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:04,068
Let's cut the brake lines
on her brand-new Prius.

401
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:07,055
- Board...
- No, don't board it.

402
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:09,512
Don't board any of it.

403
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:11,395
- - What?
- Why?

404
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,012
Because the zoo director
didn't do anything wrong,

405
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:16,414
and punishing an innocent
zoo director is...

406
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,491
a bad idea.

407
00:17:19,863 --> 00:17:22,614
But you said
there were no bad ideas.

408
00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:25,634
I was wrong.
Most ideas are bad.

409
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:28,806
It's okay to think them,
just don't act on them.

410
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:30,751
Apostasy!

411
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,201
He's not an "us" anymore,
he's a "them."

412
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:36,681
Them! Them! Them!

413
00:17:36,766 --> 00:17:38,568
Enough is enough!

414
00:17:38,653 --> 00:17:41,651
Look, we have Slow Leonard.
He wasn't kidnapped.

415
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:45,470
Real, living turtle!

416
00:17:45,554 --> 00:17:46,563
Let's talk sense here.

417
00:17:46,647 --> 00:17:48,324
The most obvious explanation

418
00:17:48,408 --> 00:17:50,580
is the one that's
before our very eyes.

419
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:52,161
- Hey, it's true.
- Yeah. - Uh-huh.

420
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:53,570
Oh, thank God.

421
00:17:53,654 --> 00:17:56,481
This is not Slow Leonard,
this is a robot.

422
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:59,576
A robot built
by Homeland Security

423
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,063
to scan our tongues
to see whom we've kissed.

424
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:06,491
We'll prove it. Scan him
with your robot detectors.

425
00:18:06,575 --> 00:18:08,344
Guys, it is the turtle.

426
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:10,220
And those robot detectors
are made of

427
00:18:10,305 --> 00:18:12,557
hair dryers and old video games.

428
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:14,666
Look, we had
a great ride together.

429
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,835
The paintball
and Pinot noir weekend,

430
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,064
the duck boat tour
of Shelbyville,

431
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:20,581
storming City Hall.

432
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:22,916
It felt so good
to be part of a community

433
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,127
Where we're all
respected and supported.

434
00:18:25,212 --> 00:18:27,674
But we can't pull our heads
inside our shells

435
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:30,273
and hide from
the very real truth:

436
00:18:30,357 --> 00:18:33,017
our lost turtle has been found.

437
00:18:36,111 --> 00:18:38,212
I cannot believe
I'm saying this.

438
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:39,916
It's not a robot.

439
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:42,119
<i>Dr. J, super dunk!</i>

440
00:18:42,415 --> 00:18:44,195
But what happens to all of us

441
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:46,056
when we don't have
anything to solve?

442
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:47,791
Nothing has to change.

443
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:51,128
We have more in common than
just the tortoise, don't we?

444
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:53,136
Well, we must. Right?

445
00:18:53,989 --> 00:18:56,742
Aw, nuts.

446
00:18:56,827 --> 00:18:58,336
Oh, great.

447
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:01,415
Now I have to get this
lasered off.

448
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:04,458
I love being in this group,
but it's over.

449
00:19:04,547 --> 00:19:06,389
And now I and the rest of us

450
00:19:06,474 --> 00:19:07,945
have to go back
to a world where

451
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,303
everyone thinks we're dumb.

452
00:19:13,957 --> 00:19:15,542
Unless

453
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:18,163
we find a new mystery
only we can solve.

454
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:19,875
Like...

455
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:23,735
Where does calamari
really come from?

456
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:26,140
Well, the common wisdom
is that it's squid,

457
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:29,666
but I say there's
no such thing as a squid.

458
00:19:29,772 --> 00:19:31,093
Board it.

459
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:33,709
Mmm, that's good squid.

460
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:35,553
I heard it's pig butt,

461
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:38,415
but the shadow pig butt counsel
spends billions

462
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,177
quashing those rumors.

463
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:41,858
Board it.

464
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:45,348
As long as we're
blowing each other's minds,

465
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:47,397
I've heard there's
a cartoon show

466
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,019
that can predict the future.

467
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:50,428
Maybe we can watch it

468
00:19:50,513 --> 00:19:52,686
and find out
what's going to happen.

469
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:58,288
Board it.

470
00:19:58,429 --> 00:19:59,621
Indubitably.

471
00:19:59,705 --> 00:20:01,774
- Making up stuff is fun.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

472
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:04,781
Well, I guess no matter
how crazy and lame people are,

473
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:08,355
they always want to hang
with other crazy lame-os.

474
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:11,937
I'm no conspiracy theorist,
but I do wonder

475
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:15,637
who stands to benefit
from all of... this?

476
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:17,795
- Space here.
- Multiverse! - Board it.

477
00:20:17,887 --> 00:20:19,890
- Okay, that's good.
- And here's another idea.

478
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:20,889
- Oh, that's...
- Hold on, I need

479
00:20:20,974 --> 00:20:22,084
- more cards.
- Yes!

480
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,367
Our profits
are through the roof.

481
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:30,578
We can't make enough yarn,
index cards and ivermectin.

482
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,484
We're in a golden age.

483
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:34,748
Keep defunding schools, America.

487
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:46,898
Okay, everybody, today we're
making one of my

488
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:50,367
favorite dishes:
conspiracy-meeting paella.

489
00:20:50,452 --> 00:20:52,328
It's a great dish
for blowing the lid off

490
00:20:52,413 --> 00:20:55,717
any diabolical plot the
mainstream media won't cover.

491
00:20:55,936 --> 00:20:59,561
CIA murders in your town,
UFO stuff.

492
00:20:59,646 --> 00:21:01,031
And it even pairs well

493
00:21:01,116 --> 00:21:03,243
with a New World Order
scenario.

494
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:05,069
Now, this is a dish
where the freshness

495
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:06,906
of the ingredients
really matters,

496
00:21:06,991 --> 00:21:10,267
like this chorizo
made from home-schooled pigs.

497
00:21:10,498 --> 00:21:12,602
If you're a lizard person
watching this,

498
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:15,351
instead of using chicken,
feel free to go with

499
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:18,413
whatever insect
or small mammal goes well

500
00:21:18,498 --> 00:21:20,035
with Calasparra rice.

501
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,695
Well, that's all
you need to know.

502
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,998
Let me know in the comments
how it turned out,

503
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,170
and what shape
you think the sun is.

504
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,163
Shh!
