Episode Title: <font color=#FFc30f>"Step Brother
From the Same Planet"</font>

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,576
Everything here
is made out of garbage.

5
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:15,081
Up cycling is at the very core
of the modern maker movement.

6
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:17,008
It's very responsible.

7
00:00:17,092 --> 00:00:19,550
Like these doggie chew toys
made out of...

8
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:21,294
used retainers?

9
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:23,014
Ugh! Too responsible!

10
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:27,404
Hey, guys.
You're craft fair fans, too?

11
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:30,107
Ew, no. We're doing
a photo scavenger hunt

12
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:31,764
for Francine's birthday party.

13
00:00:31,848 --> 00:00:33,951
We need a picture
of something sad.

14
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:36,457
I wonder why I wasn't invited.

15
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,950
'Cause you're a party narc
who ruins everybody's fun.

16
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:42,919
What?
When have I ever done that?

17
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:45,568
You once deflated a bouncy house
'cause you smelled mildew.

18
00:00:45,653 --> 00:00:46,720
You shut down a pool party

19
00:00:46,804 --> 00:00:48,480
'cause the diving board
wasn't code.

20
00:00:48,564 --> 00:00:49,740
You stopped a barbecue

21
00:00:49,824 --> 00:00:52,076
because the fire extinguishers
were expired.

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,879
Okay, okay, I get it.

23
00:00:53,964 --> 00:00:55,821
Basically, you're a wet blanket.

24
00:00:55,905 --> 00:00:58,064
That's not true,
she's more like a blanket

25
00:00:58,148 --> 00:01:00,826
that tattles and kills all joy.

26
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,473
Ooh, that's sad.

27
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,333
Oh, what a beautiful little box.

28
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:09,818
I'll take this.

29
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:11,336
You'll need this polish.

30
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,505
It's my blend
of secret ingredients,

31
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:17,250
including carnauba wax.
That-that one's not a secret.

32
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:18,994
Okay, I'll take both.

33
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:20,329
I have to explain to the box

34
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,088
that it's going
to live with you now.

35
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:23,941
Okay, baby, you're gonna go...

36
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:26,301
Are you
seeing this?

37
00:01:26,385 --> 00:01:28,261
Are you seeing that?

38
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:31,023
Man bun.

39
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:33,525
Pathetic old dude
thinks death won't find him

40
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:35,694
if he has a freaky hair lump.

41
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:38,662
Stupid bun.

42
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,351
Homer, Marge!

43
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,313
You finally get
to meet my special lady.

44
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:47,039
This is Blythe.

45
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:49,691
Special lady? Since when?

46
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:53,378
Oh. Oh, it's been
almost six months.

47
00:01:53,462 --> 00:01:55,306
And we're just
hearing about it now?

48
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,550
What do you mean?
I left you tons of messages.

49
00:01:58,634 --> 00:02:00,552
I thought those were
all butt-dials.

50
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:03,805
<i>Homer, I've met someone...</i>

51
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,422
<i>I'm in lo...</i>

52
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:07,867
<i>Blythe and I are getting seri...</i>

53
00:02:07,952 --> 00:02:12,062
<i>I fell out of the senior van and I'm lost...</i>

54
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,722
How did you two meet?

55
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:16,375
I was hired by
the Retirement Castle

56
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,497
<i>to cleanse auras with
a therapeutic sound bath.</i>

57
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:22,649
But I don't want inner peace.

58
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:29,656
<i>But when she
started gongin' her gongs,</i>

59
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,086
<i>it felt like I stuck my tongue
in love's power outlet.</i>

60
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,406
Oh, wow.

61
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,850
<i>As Abe vibrated past,</i>

62
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:43,745
<i>there was something inside him
that called to me.</i>

63
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:46,857
<i>It was the bullet I
fired into my foot during the war</i>

64
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:48,767
<i>to get out of KP duty.</i>

65
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,184
We're not wasting
any more time.

66
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:01,187
I'm moving in with her.

67
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:04,282
I finally found true love.

68
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:06,618
And I finally won't have to pay

69
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:10,122
for your retirement home.

70
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:15,052
You have so many chimes.

71
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:17,370
You're not going
to miss any wind.

72
00:03:17,454 --> 00:03:19,615
Ooh, this is my son Calvin.

73
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,950
Felicitous greetings
on this day to you.

74
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:23,710
That's how this one guy talked
in<i> Star Trek</i>

75
00:03:23,794 --> 00:03:25,303
when they went
to a Shakespeare planet.

76
00:03:25,387 --> 00:03:26,897
It's how I'm saying hello
these days.

77
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:29,566
Oh, uh, hello-eth to you.

78
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,384
What a charmer.

79
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:33,737
- How old is Calvin?
- 11.

80
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:35,906
Hmm, so you had him
when you were...

81
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,558
Oh, he's adopted.

82
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:42,661
Cute kid, but, man,
my dad's gonna eat him alive.

83
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:47,084
Hey, there's my guy.

84
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:48,419
Wha?

85
00:03:48,503 --> 00:03:50,503
Uppies!

86
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:56,151
He never gave me uppies.

87
00:04:00,348 --> 00:04:04,159
Abe and Calvin
love to cook for company.

88
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:05,844
Final looks on
the plating, chef.

89
00:04:05,928 --> 00:04:09,014
That one needs a sweep
of balsamic, chef.

90
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:11,500
Nobody's refilled
my water glass.

91
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,186
This restaurant
would get zero Michelin tires.

92
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,855
Tonight we've made for you
a roasted chicken

93
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:18,431
with apricot and fennel.

94
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:21,009
- Mmm.
- How are we enjoying the first bites?

95
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:22,758
Hmm...

96
00:04:22,843 --> 00:04:25,272
Well, I'm not
getting fennel at all.

97
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:27,032
So that's a fail.

98
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:28,350
Don't be rude.

99
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,960
Shelf rat!

100
00:04:30,155 --> 00:04:33,914
Well, they're both rodents,
but this little dude

101
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:36,650
is a Sciuridae, or squirrel,
if you prefer.

102
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:39,586
I'd prefer that it not
stare into my soul

103
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:40,773
like it knows my sins.

104
00:04:40,858 --> 00:04:44,711
Calvin does taxidermy.
That's one of his pieces.

105
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:49,343
He's a rising star in the field.
He takes classes with adults.

106
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:50,937
You can't even see
the tire tracks

107
00:04:51,022 --> 00:04:52,483
on this guy anymore.

108
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:54,858
Uhp, time for your
glocky-drops, Abe.

109
00:04:54,952 --> 00:04:59,109
Aw, that stuff makes me blinder
than an umpire in a mineshaft.

110
00:04:59,194 --> 00:05:02,993
You know the drill, commodore.
Head back, eyes open.

111
00:05:03,265 --> 00:05:06,663
Rain, rain.

112
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:08,701
Windshield wipers!

113
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:14,299
Here you go, sweetie.

114
00:05:14,383 --> 00:05:18,436
We made that chestnut stuffing
I know you love.

115
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:21,991
Abe, you're
feeding the thermostat again.

116
00:05:22,075 --> 00:05:24,743
D'oh! Damn glocky-drops!

117
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:29,390
Yo, our grandfather
Abe Simpson moved out,

118
00:05:29,474 --> 00:05:31,668
- but left his...
- denture cup.

119
00:05:31,752 --> 00:05:33,227
Do you have a lost and found?

120
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,896
Please say you don't have
a lost and found.

121
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,155
Oh, Abe's moved out?

122
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:38,582
Well, his room is paid up
for the next two weeks.

123
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,085
Uh, actually, I misspoke.

124
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:45,330
Um, Abe is still using the room.
Using it like crazy.

125
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:49,577
We own this place
for two whole weeks.

126
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:51,429
- Hmm.
- We can take a shower in a chair,

127
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:53,856
- flush the toilet a million times...
- Interesting.

128
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,026
Oh, you're gonna tell Mom and
Dad about this, aren't you?

129
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,197
Nope, this is one whistle
I'm not gonna blow.

130
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:05,760
Instead,
what if we used this room

131
00:06:05,844 --> 00:06:08,930
to throw the greatest
slumber party ever?

132
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:10,991
No rules, no limits,

133
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:14,544
and, dare I say it,
no slumbering.

134
00:06:14,628 --> 00:06:16,628
Tell me more.

135
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,975
Also, that kid
is not that good of a cook.

136
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,608
There's such a thing
as chicken being

137
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:25,611
too tender and juicy, you know?

138
00:06:25,696 --> 00:06:29,233
Our wood is really loving
this carnauba stuff.

139
00:06:29,358 --> 00:06:32,210
And what kind of kid
does taxidermy?

140
00:06:32,374 --> 00:06:34,038
Dead animals are meant to be

141
00:06:34,123 --> 00:06:36,101
poked with a stick,
end of story.

142
00:06:36,186 --> 00:06:39,330
Homer, you've been complaining
about Calvin for three days.

143
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,793
Why are you
so obsessed with him?

144
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:44,188
What? I don't
think about him at all.

145
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:47,616
But did you notice
how he asked to be excused?

146
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:49,971
That speaks to
a guilty conscience.

147
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:51,139
And another thing.

148
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,165
Why is my tongue swelling up?

149
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:55,120
What is this rash?

150
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:57,032
Oh, my gosh.

151
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,720
You must be having an allergic
reaction to the carnauba wax.

152
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:03,131
Well, stop using it!

153
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:06,319
I-I've rubbed it
into the floors, the windows.

154
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:09,562
Every wood surface in the house
has been carnauba'd!

155
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:11,718
It'll take weeks to dissipate!

156
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,918
But where do I go to breathe?

157
00:07:17,028 --> 00:07:18,646
Yay, you're here.

158
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:20,834
I was putting up
glow-in-the-dark stars.

159
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:22,664
I'll let you
distribute the other half,

160
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:25,030
since you're
kind of like my brother now.

161
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:27,766
Brother?
I'm a grown man.

162
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,094
Half?
This is barely a third. No fair!

163
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:32,272
Dad!

164
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,953
Okay, Harry Potter
chapter read, pillow fluffed...

165
00:07:40,147 --> 00:07:42,908
Scary German puppet
turned to face the wall.

166
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:44,283
Uh-huh.

167
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:47,804
And now, a good-night kiss.

168
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:49,186
Mmm...

169
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:50,557
Watch your feet!

170
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,247
Night, Calvin.

171
00:07:55,827 --> 00:07:59,464
Psst. Homer.
Want to play 20 questions?

172
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:03,157
Okay.
Question number one: Shut up.

173
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,109
You're funny.

174
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,726
We should go out
on our bikes tomorrow.

175
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:09,952
I know this place by the nuclear
plant that has the best jumps.

176
00:08:10,085 --> 00:08:11,687
Oh, wait.
Did you bring your bike?

177
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:14,081
I don't have a bike,
I have a car.

178
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:16,147
And I don't play
at the nuclear plant,

179
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:20,696
I work there
because I am a grown-up.

180
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,698
Abe says I'm mature for my age.

181
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:24,335
When we check in
at a restaurant,

182
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,504
he gives the host my name,

183
00:08:25,662 --> 00:08:28,007
so I'm practically
a grown-up, too.

184
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:30,039
No, you're not.
You're a pants-wetting baby.

185
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:33,024
That is patently untrue.

186
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:34,710
I have
excellent bladder control.

187
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:37,621
If anything,
I hold it in too long.

188
00:08:37,705 --> 00:08:38,789
Pants-wetting baby!

189
00:08:38,873 --> 00:08:41,217
Stop lying!

190
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:44,202
You threw that zipper-first!

191
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:49,040
My orrery!
Eat gas giants!

192
00:08:49,124 --> 00:08:51,819
I'll give you a gas giant!

193
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,805
Stop squirming
and let me fart...

194
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,734
- No!
- ...on your head!

195
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:00,994
Never!

196
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:02,078
Ow!

197
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,983
I welcomed you into my home,

198
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:09,525
my room,
where I keep my artifacts.

199
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,363
But you, sir, are a butt brain!

200
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:16,718
From here on out, it's war.

201
00:09:53,447 --> 00:09:56,683
Thank you, Mother.
Pickup is noon tomorrow.

202
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:59,502
Don't be early.
Bye, now.

203
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:04,215
Drive away. Don't look back.

204
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:13,033
Welcome to our pop-up sleepover.

205
00:10:13,117 --> 00:10:15,460
Do you have the "birthday gift"?

206
00:10:15,544 --> 00:10:18,221
One $25 gift card.

207
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:25,045
Take off your shoes,
we have unlimited bed-jumping.

208
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:29,733
I've never felt so alive!

209
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:33,887
We got PG-13 movies,
rated "M" video games.

210
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:35,480
What if Mother calls?

211
00:10:35,564 --> 00:10:39,059
We got Milhouse in the closet
standing by. Guy's a pro.

212
00:10:39,143 --> 00:10:41,670
Oh, hello, Wendell's mom.

213
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:44,823
Yes, I will remind him
to wear his night guard,

214
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:48,050
- because I am another parent.
- Love you.

215
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:54,338
Lis, take a moment.
We did this. You did this.

216
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:05,602
I am Lisa, bringer of fun.

217
00:11:05,686 --> 00:11:08,446
Driest of blankets.

218
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:12,759
Must you hit every bump?

219
00:11:13,844 --> 00:11:14,761
Oh!

220
00:11:14,845 --> 00:11:16,096
Oops.

221
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:18,724
I make a million dollars a year.
Did you know that?

222
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:20,485
- No, you don't.
- Oh, yeah?

223
00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:22,627
Then why do
I have a ton of DVDs?

224
00:11:22,712 --> 00:11:24,387
What's a DVD?

225
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:27,941
Ugh, your car smells like
fried chicken.

226
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:30,806
No,<i> I</i> smell like fried chicken.

227
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:33,862
Can you breathe
through your mouth?

228
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:35,697
Your nose is squeaky.

229
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:41,619
Yeah?

230
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:05,714
Wow, Calvin, what a great start.

231
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:09,236
But how would a pelican have
access to a freshwater fish?

232
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:12,261
Well, that's the joke!

233
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:17,791
Oh, so funny to murder
innocent water birds.

234
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:20,784
Uh, it died
of natural causes, ding-dong.

235
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:23,010
I have a network
of park ranger friends

236
00:12:23,095 --> 00:12:24,691
who save dead animals for me.

237
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:28,453
So you're not a psychopath,
just a weirdo. Got it.

238
00:12:28,537 --> 00:12:31,048
It's always sad
when an animal dies,

239
00:12:31,132 --> 00:12:34,924
but this pelican gets to
speak to the world as art.

240
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:37,220
I was inspired to make this

241
00:12:37,305 --> 00:12:39,649
after Abe told me about
his time in the war.

242
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:43,416
His stories are so cool,
but disturbing.

243
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,010
I will not sit here

244
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:48,033
and have you call
my father's stories cool!

245
00:12:48,118 --> 00:12:50,094
They're meandering and endless.

246
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:53,619
I'm going to Moe's,
where people know what's boring.

247
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:56,791
And it's not just taxidermy,

248
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:59,266
Calvin's got
a million creepy hobbies.

249
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:01,814
And my dad
thinks they're all great.

250
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:05,824
When I was his age, I was
cleaning pool covers from below.

251
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:09,345
Yeah, going house to house
with my scrub brush and Speedo.

252
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:12,348
I stuck googly eyes on shells
and sold them at the beach.

253
00:13:12,432 --> 00:13:14,666
Till my dad
told me to knock it off

254
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,853
because people would think
I was a freak.

255
00:13:16,937 --> 00:13:19,752
Yeah, my pop also
told me to lay low.

256
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:21,650
Literally.
We were gravediggers.

257
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:24,268
We took turns
sleeping in open graves.

258
00:13:24,352 --> 00:13:26,195
Heh. Nothin' builds character

259
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:29,666
like waking up to a coffin
being lowered on top of yo use.

260
00:13:29,857 --> 00:13:31,741
To unprocessed trauma.

261
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,650
- Hi, Lisa!
- She waved to us!

262
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:39,002
Our sleepover is a hit.

263
00:13:39,141 --> 00:13:40,950
We have the room
for one more weekend.

264
00:13:41,035 --> 00:13:43,287
We're gonna be
gift card thousand-aires.

265
00:13:43,371 --> 00:13:46,123
No, Bart, we have
to reinvest in our next party.

266
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:47,550
We have to top ourselves.

267
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:51,128
I'm thinking face painters,
walk-around Sponge Bob,

268
00:13:51,212 --> 00:13:53,781
one of those pools
you can surf in.

269
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:57,393
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you chain-sucking lollypops?

270
00:13:57,477 --> 00:13:59,136
Just need a little something

271
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,063
'cause I didn't sleep much
last night.

272
00:14:01,147 --> 00:14:03,548
I was pricing
mashed potato stations.

273
00:14:03,632 --> 00:14:07,799
Lisa, in the non-weekend world,
you have to have a bedtime.

274
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:10,182
I don't want to live in
the non-weekend world.

275
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,628
We've only got one more chance

276
00:14:12,713 --> 00:14:15,745
to scrawl our names
across the slumber party sky.

277
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:17,870
I'll sleep when I'm nine.

278
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:27,836
Hmm? Hmm.

279
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:29,995
Look at me, I'm Calvin.

280
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,401
I'm little but I use big words.

281
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:35,247
Son, I know it's hard
sharing a room

282
00:14:35,331 --> 00:14:39,084
with someone so,
uh, different than you.

283
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:42,562
But you've handled it
with grace and maturity.

284
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:45,920
Anyway, I just wanted to say

285
00:14:46,005 --> 00:14:48,924
I'm so proud of you... Calvin.

286
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:51,486
Ooh, aah, dah!

287
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:55,767
I can't see a thing with
these glaucoma drops.

288
00:14:56,036 --> 00:14:57,344
<i>He thinks I'm Calvin.</i>

289
00:14:57,525 --> 00:14:59,271
<i>Look at how he looks at him.</i>

290
00:14:59,355 --> 00:15:01,290
<i>He never looked at me that way.</i>

291
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:03,884
Are you okay, kid?
You seem kind of quiet.

292
00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:06,462
It's just...
I've never heard you say

293
00:15:06,736 --> 00:15:10,900
you were proud of me.
Ever. In my entire life.

294
00:15:10,985 --> 00:15:12,493
What are you talking about?

295
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:15,787
I say that to you
all the time, Calvin.

296
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:18,549
Oh.

297
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:19,883
I forgot.

298
00:15:27,642 --> 00:15:31,153
Homer, you villain!
Do not harm that birdhouse.

299
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:33,489
The nuthatches
did nothing to you!

300
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:36,567
What's wrong with you?

301
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:40,070
My dad kisses the butt
you walk on.

302
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:42,239
I'd get it
if you were great at sports,

303
00:15:42,323 --> 00:15:45,392
or fixing cars,
or demolishing buildings,

304
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:47,895
but you're just
a weird little kid.

305
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:50,172
And my dad
hates weird little kids.

306
00:15:50,256 --> 00:15:53,083
At least... he sure hated me.

307
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:56,328
Homer, Abe doesn't hate you.

308
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:57,680
Oh, yeah? I'll show you.

309
00:15:57,764 --> 00:16:00,591
We got ten minutes
until his eye drops wear off.

310
00:16:00,675 --> 00:16:02,767
You be me.

311
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:06,522
Dad, do you have a second?

312
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:10,016
Dang it, Homer. Do you think
I'm made of seconds?

313
00:16:10,822 --> 00:16:14,369
I was in the middle of a very
important word find puzzle.

314
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,284
I was about to find the longest
diagonal of my career.

315
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:18,517
Now what do you want?!

316
00:16:18,601 --> 00:16:20,036
Um, I-I...

317
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,703
You, you, you nothing!

318
00:16:24,877 --> 00:16:27,043
Wow, that was harsh.

319
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:29,620
Do you ever tell him
how he makes you feel?

320
00:16:29,704 --> 00:16:32,864
Kinda. I stuck him in the worst
nursing home I could find.

321
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:34,625
Figured he'd
read between the lines.

322
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:38,054
I think you need to find a new
way to express your feelings.

323
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:40,890
It might need to be more
than just words.

324
00:16:41,088 --> 00:16:45,544
But my way with words be my
best mouth a-ma-call its. Aw.

325
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:48,380
You'll figure out a way
to get through to your dad.

326
00:16:48,464 --> 00:16:51,107
You just need to put on
your thinking cap.

327
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,241
Where have you been?

328
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:00,801
I had to get Band-Aids.

329
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:03,135
Lewis got stabbed
with a juice box straw.

330
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:06,495
Somebody fed the pony Pop Rocks
and he kicked out the TV.

331
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,084
His poop is popping!

332
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:14,517
The climbing wall collapsed
onto the Reptile Rodeo.

333
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,822
There's loose tails everywhere.

334
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:21,142
I tried to throw a party,
but the party threw me.

335
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:22,823
I'm putting a stop to this.

336
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:24,082
Are you sure?

337
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,861
You know
what that will make you.

338
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:29,421
Hello? Yes,
I'd like to blow the whistle

339
00:17:29,505 --> 00:17:33,091
on an out-of-control party
at The Retirement Castle.

340
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:37,770
Oh, my name?
It's Lisa Simpson, party narc.

341
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:42,192
Well, the party's shut down,
kids are packing up their stuff.

342
00:17:42,276 --> 00:17:44,620
Great.
I'm sure they all hate me.

343
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:46,680
Yeah, probably.

344
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:49,959
I gotta dump the churro sugar
out of my shoes.

345
00:17:52,378 --> 00:17:53,945
They've arrested Lisa!

346
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:58,127
She's paying the ultimate price
for throwing the ultimate party.

347
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,021
You're our hero, Lisa!

348
00:18:02,871 --> 00:18:04,893
If you drive me home
with the siren on,

349
00:18:04,978 --> 00:18:07,718
we've got a freezer
full of Snickers.

350
00:18:07,802 --> 00:18:09,553
Go, Lisa!

351
00:18:09,637 --> 00:18:12,695
- Lisa, you're the best!
- You got this, Lisa!

352
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,538
Call your lawyer!

353
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,572
There's some really
inspiring work here tonight.

354
00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:27,888
Yours is a blistering indictment
of American consumerism.

355
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,723
I love how the middle joey

356
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:31,483
is looking in
the opposite direction,

357
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:34,362
as if imagining
a different future.

358
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,128
Glad you got that.
I worried it was too subtle.

359
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:39,752
Oh, it hit me
like a ton of bricks.

360
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:46,690
Now, let's announce
tonight's winners.

361
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:50,010
Hold on, there's one more entry!

362
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,104
A strange man with an object
hidden under a pillowcase?

363
00:18:54,189 --> 00:18:57,572
Come on up!
I want to see this.

364
00:18:57,852 --> 00:19:00,948
I was told to find
a new way to communicate.

365
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:04,932
My stepbrother Calvin expresses
his feelings through taxidermy,

366
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:08,445
so I decided
I would do the same.

367
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:11,573
That's not taxidermy, you idjit!

368
00:19:11,658 --> 00:19:15,394
But it's very deep. And... sad.

369
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:19,236
The small shell pleading with
its eyes to the larger one.

370
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:23,517
It is clearly about a son's need
for his father's approval.

371
00:19:23,602 --> 00:19:27,263
What? It's just two smelly
shells glued on a board.

372
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:31,845
Abe, look at it.
Really look at it.

373
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,824
Hmm.

374
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:46,271
What these shells are
saying, is that how you feel?

375
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:49,650
You seem to love
being a dad to Calvin,

376
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:53,845
but you hated
being a dad to me.

377
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:58,654
No, son, no.
See, when you were a kid,

378
00:19:58,762 --> 00:20:02,366
being a dad felt like
the end of my youth.

379
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:04,517
But now with Calvin,

380
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:07,739
it's my last chance
to feel young.

381
00:20:07,824 --> 00:20:12,544
Oh, so what you're saying is
no matter how old you are,

382
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:16,582
it's only ever been about
what<i> you</i> need.

383
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,994
You finally get me.

384
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,648
It wasn't because
I was a bad kid.

385
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:25,259
You're just horribly flawed.

386
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:27,426
I am!

387
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:32,595
Another family
saved by taxidermy.

388
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:34,329
All right, let's wrap things up.

389
00:20:34,437 --> 00:20:36,688
We have 20 minutes
before this room is taken over

390
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:38,759
by the Massage Table Expo.

395
00:20:50,821 --> 00:20:52,982
So, Blythe dumped me for a guy

396
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:55,424
she says is a better
spiritual match for her.

397
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:58,103
Also, he's super rich
and can eat corn.

398
00:20:58,188 --> 00:21:00,667
He's taking Calvin to Africa
to study animals

399
00:21:00,751 --> 00:21:02,228
in their natural habitat.

400
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:05,220
I'll miss that little scamp,
but you know,

401
00:21:05,408 --> 00:21:08,222
I'm glad you and I
are finally communicating.

402
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:11,962
I love you, son.
Anyway, call me back.

403
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:14,705
Your dad left you another message.

404
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,207
Eh, it's probably
just a butt-dial.

405
00:21:30,012 --> 00:21:31,012
<i>Shh!</i>
