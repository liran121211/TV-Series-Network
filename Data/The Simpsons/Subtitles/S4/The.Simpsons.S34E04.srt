1
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:10,761
Krusty, bubbeleh, take it easy,
this is a great booking.

2
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,945
Don't bubbeleh me, boychik.

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,324
Entertaining the kids at
Kelly Clark son's housewarming.

4
00:00:16,408 --> 00:00:19,843
It's not my fault you lost
all your money on NFTs...

5
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:21,605
Non-funny TV shows.

6
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,441
Now get to work,
you're behind on your Cameos.

7
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:28,226
Hey, hey, Jacob!

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,448
Your dad's super-sad he couldn't
make it to your bar mitzvah.

9
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,024
It's a real shonda.

10
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:36,796
Also, all the best
from Dad's new wife, Shonda.

11
00:00:41,396 --> 00:00:43,247
Oh...

12
00:00:44,436 --> 00:00:46,612
Thank you so much
for doing this, Krusty.

13
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:48,131
Kelly really appreciates it.

14
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,883
And the children are all
huge fans. Right, kids?

15
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,637
- Mm-hmm. - Totally.
- Yeah, we love you, Crisco.

16
00:00:56,991 --> 00:01:00,485
Oh, what's that Kelly Clarks on
got that I don't?

17
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,915
We all won singing contests
20 years ago.

18
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:07,252
Oh, where's<i> my</i> infinity toilet?

19
00:01:07,336 --> 00:01:10,296
Oh, that toilet isn't
from<i> American Idol</i> money.

20
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:12,171
You're looking
at daytime-syndicated

21
00:01:12,227 --> 00:01:13,144
talk show wealth.

22
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:14,813
See those mega mansions?

23
00:01:14,897 --> 00:01:17,315
Well, they belong to
the superstars of daytime TV:

24
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:19,392
-Rachael Ray, Wendy Williams,
-Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

25
00:01:19,476 --> 00:01:21,152
And that jerk Doctor Phil.

26
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:24,468
All bought and paid for
with syndicated megabucks.

27
00:01:24,593 --> 00:01:26,570
I see something in you, Krusty.

28
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:28,993
Oh, I was gonna put it back.

29
00:01:29,077 --> 00:01:30,495
You have daytime chops.

30
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:32,647
There's always a place on TV
for a Regis...

31
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:35,166
A cranky but lovable,
sexless grandpa.

32
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,551
Yeah, and what makes you
the expert?

33
00:01:40,255 --> 00:01:44,326
Here's the real test.
Get that mom squad dancing.

34
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,253
Daytime audiences love to dance.

35
00:01:47,337 --> 00:01:49,106
Forget it, lady.
I still got my dignity.

36
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,333
Hey, wait.

37
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:52,834
Mm...

38
00:01:52,918 --> 00:01:54,277
Hey, hey, Bryson!

39
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:57,263
Your mom wanted me
to congratulate you on...

40
00:01:57,347 --> 00:01:59,858
getting your braces tightened.

41
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:02,026
Make up a rap about it?

42
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,863
Look, fine, I'll dance.

All this food I can't eat
is taunting me.

52
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:35,910
I read that grain-free
is supposed to be good.

53
00:02:35,994 --> 00:02:37,212
Or was it grain-full?

54
00:02:37,296 --> 00:02:38,730
Mom, can we get a gecko?

55
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:40,490
I want a guinea pig.

56
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:42,808
How about both in one cage,
and see what happens?

57
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:45,311
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, please, mom?

58
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:47,340
- Please, come on, a gecko and a guinea pig.
- No! Why would we...

59
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:59,083
Marge, honestly, is this
how you pictured your life?

60
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:01,252
I think not.

61
00:03:01,336 --> 00:03:03,922
Yes, I lick my behind.
Big surprise.

62
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:05,924
Excuse me, would you
like to come participate

63
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:07,575
in a focus group?

64
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:10,020
Yes, anything but this.

65
00:03:10,104 --> 00:03:11,728
Just pick a food.

66
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:14,481
Oh...

67
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:20,030
We want to know what you want
in your daytime programming.

68
00:03:20,114 --> 00:03:22,848
There are no wrong answers
and no bad ideas.

69
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:25,427
In that case, recipes.

70
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:26,535
Sure.

71
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:29,097
Air-fryer recipes.

72
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:33,710
Celebrities come on the show?

73
00:03:33,794 --> 00:03:35,194
Well, yes, obviously, but...

74
00:03:35,278 --> 00:03:36,955
Put it on the board, then.

75
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:39,123
Uh, I was thinking...

76
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:41,943
Something with vacuums.

77
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:48,299
Shiny coat or liver support?

78
00:03:48,383 --> 00:03:51,101
Why are they doing this to us?

79
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:54,730
- Hats?
- What about hats, Helen?

80
00:03:55,724 --> 00:03:56,958
Maybe...

81
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:59,218
babies wearing hats?

82
00:03:59,302 --> 00:04:02,146
And it's a whole
baby hat fashion show?

83
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,798
- Exactly. Exactly.
- Oh, yeah, there you go. - Ooh.

84
00:04:03,882 --> 00:04:05,242
That's not bad.

85
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:07,727
And you know how
there are just too many

86
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:09,562
dog food options these days?

87
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:12,824
What if you brought out
Instagram dogs

88
00:04:12,908 --> 00:04:14,993
and had them do a taste test?

89
00:04:15,077 --> 00:04:16,995
Wow!
Well, that's really good.

90
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,813
What other ideas do you have?

91
00:04:18,897 --> 00:04:20,498
Candle unboxing and sniffing.

92
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:24,152
Celebrities read nice tweets
about other celebrities.

93
00:04:24,236 --> 00:04:26,596
Unexpected jack-o'-lanterns.

94
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,506
Funny bed-making fails.

95
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,582
And...

96
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:33,495
tweens explain TikToks
to carpool moms.

97
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:34,728
Eh?

98
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:38,108
You're a natural.
You've got nice ideas

99
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:40,001
coming out the wazoo.

100
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:43,004
You know, I'm in the market
for a new segment producer.

101
00:04:43,088 --> 00:04:44,263
You are?

102
00:04:44,347 --> 00:04:45,690
Will you excuse me for a second?

103
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:47,191
Jerry, you're fired.

104
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:49,701
I'm... I'm free.

105
00:04:51,354 --> 00:04:52,938
Segment producer?

106
00:04:53,022 --> 00:04:54,291
I don't know.
I-I should probably

107
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,417
talk it over with my family.

108
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:04,765
I'll take the job.

109
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:06,952
Be warned, segment producer.

110
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:09,639
No one makes it out of these
shows unchanged.

111
00:05:09,723 --> 00:05:13,143
Oh, well, then it's a good thing
I'm not much of a changer.

112
00:05:13,227 --> 00:05:15,979
You can keep your job
or you can keep your soul,

113
00:05:16,063 --> 00:05:17,205
but you can't keep both.

114
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:19,707
Also, when you
turn in your receipts,

115
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,544
break them down
between dining and mileage

116
00:05:22,628 --> 00:05:25,304
or you'll await
the reimbursements...

117
00:05:25,388 --> 00:05:26,571
forever!

118
00:05:32,397 --> 00:05:36,059
So this is behind the scenes
of a TV show.

119
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:38,228
So much hustle.

120
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:39,837
And bustle.

121
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,800
Mm... mm.

122
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,404
This is your desk.

123
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:50,741
And this is where you can pin
all your genius segment ideas.

124
00:05:50,825 --> 00:05:52,518
With five shows a week,
it's very important

125
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,078
that you always
be thinking up segments.

126
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:56,467
A daytime talk show without

127
00:05:56,552 --> 00:05:59,082
fun and interesting segments
is like a...

128
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,084
You, finish my metaphor.

129
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:02,361
Uh, um...

130
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,697
Get me a baked potato

131
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,199
so I can throw it at your head.

132
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,426
Now!

133
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,578
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

134
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:17,543
Oh, I-I don't need
to order lunch.

135
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,046
My kids packed mine as a
special treat for my first day.

136
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,005
Aw.

137
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:28,128
Hmm. Maybe I will
take a look at that menu.

138
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:31,798
Can I order you something, um...
What-what's your name?

139
00:06:31,882 --> 00:06:33,967
Uh, to make it simpler
for the producers,

140
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:35,601
we're-we're all named Jordan.

141
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:41,475
I should've ordered some salad

142
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:45,069
to go with my salad toppings.

143
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,781
Mm.

144
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,703
Oh.

145
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:58,751
What the hell is this?

146
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,827
You people
didn't write me any jokes.

147
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:03,404
You don't need jokes.
The women in our audience

148
00:07:03,488 --> 00:07:05,482
are just happy
to be out of the house.

149
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:08,260
They want to dance to
clean versions of Pitbull songs

150
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,746
and go home with a free copy
of a<i> Real Housewives</i> memoir.

151
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,007
Your only job is just be nice.

152
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:16,042
It's all about nice.

153
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:18,996
Did you just make eye contact
with the host?

154
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,347
No, I would never!

155
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:23,183
- Aah!
- Oh!

156
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:26,837
Ladies and gay friends,
I'm MC Hairbone,

157
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:29,673
the funkiest daytime DJ

I already got
a wardrobe malfunction.

173
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,737
That's the kind of joke we get.

174
00:08:12,052 --> 00:08:13,263
Ah.

00:08:15,986 --> 00:08:18,497
Oh, my God,
this is my first segment.

00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,408
I hope people like it, Jordan.

177
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:24,092
Look at this guy.
He's saying,

178
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:26,413
"I'm gonna wrangle me up a nap."

179
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:30,491
These are my people.

180
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:33,161
And they're raising the roof
for my idea.

181
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:36,646
Can you believe
we get paid for this?

182
00:08:36,748 --> 00:08:38,033
We don't.

183
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:43,004
Bart, you're taking this
really well.

184
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:45,082
I'd have thought
you'd be hatching some scheme

185
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,219
to get the old Krusty show back.

186
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:48,480
Why would I do that?

187
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:50,604
I've got my favorite Krusty
episodes right here.

188
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:53,076
More than 700 of 'em.

189
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,109
Hm, kind of makes you think.

190
00:08:56,193 --> 00:08:58,762
Once you have enough episodes
of any classic show,

191
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:00,931
why do you need
to keep making more?

192
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:02,690
Well, the reason is...

193
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:04,359
Shh.
Watching classic Krusty.

194
00:09:08,522 --> 00:09:10,290
Oh, it's just so easy.

195
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:12,125
I don't
have to be funny anymore.

196
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:13,443
I just have to be nice.

197
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:16,515
It's the greatest grift
I've ever done.

198
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:19,966
I'm gonna go buy some cars.

199
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:22,469
- Mm...
- You did a great job today, Marge.

200
00:09:22,553 --> 00:09:25,731
You know, we women have to
stick together in this business.

201
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,900
But I also want you
to never quite be sure

202
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,385
where you stand with me,
and just have

203
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:32,721
a general sense of unease
about my intentions.

204
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,390
Does that make sense?

205
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,058
I think so.

206
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,059
Great.

207
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,652
Okay, everybody,
conference room.

208
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:40,396
Pitch meeting for tomorrow.

209
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,580
You, plaid shirt.

210
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,582
Not you.
Plaid shirt, tall. Yeah.

211
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,083
Bring the binder
of dinner menus.

00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:21,787
You would not believe
the day I had.

228
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,548
Oh, please, let's eat.
I'm starving.

229
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:26,625
Oh, but if the bill looks high,
it's because

230
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,218
I already ate a full meal here.

231
00:10:30,638 --> 00:10:32,448
And then Krusty
didn't even tell us

232
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,374
he had swapped
the A and B blocks.

233
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,726
I'd already preset
the demo table

234
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,787
for my segment,
"popcorn maker wars."

235
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,231
So, then it's my fault

236
00:10:40,315 --> 00:10:42,549
the "reuniting soldiers
and their dogs" segment

237
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:44,293
was such a disaster?

238
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,387
Carla's the one who
turned on the popcorn machines.

239
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:49,740
And that's
Hair Department Carla?

240
00:10:49,824 --> 00:10:52,576
No, Hair Department Carla
is blonde.

241
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,653
You know, my day
was pretty crazy, too.

242
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,973
Lenny came in this morning
with a ladybug on his shirt,

243
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,976
and we were seeing how long
before he noticed it.

244
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,587
Segment idea:
"Krusty goes blond."

245
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:07,258
Lenny made it
all the way to lunch

246
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:10,002
and then the little guy
just fell off on its own.

247
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,580
We called him Ladybug Lenny

248
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:15,415
for the rest of the day!

249
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,436
Ah, ladybugs.

250
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,605
Oh, I have to go back
to the office.

251
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:23,849
The viral skateboard grandma
we booked for tomorrow

252
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,734
has a history of racist tweets.

253
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,238
Uh, Marge, I forgot my wallet.

254
00:11:34,518 --> 00:11:35,527
Hmm.

255
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,620
No.

256
00:11:36,704 --> 00:11:39,531
No. Too edgy.
Too soft.

257
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,866
What is this, Corden?

258
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,850
Seen it.

259
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,186
Not timely.
Too timely.

260
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,612
Way too soft.

261
00:11:45,696 --> 00:11:47,298
What is this, Fall on?

262
00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:49,358
"Good luck Mom, we love you."

263
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,617
I don't even get this.

264
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:52,968
Is that all you got?

265
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,388
Mm...

266
00:11:56,874 --> 00:12:00,218
Guys, I know I've been
a little stressed lately,

267
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:04,056
but it's so nice for us
to all sit down together.

268
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,376
It's okay, Mom.
You're doing your dream job.

269
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,968
Yeah, we're proud of you, Mom.

270
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:10,487
Now pass the index cards.

271
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:11,547
The what?

272
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,549
I'm hungry for segments.

273
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,384
Aah!

274
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,386
What's the matter,
Marge?

275
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,141
You haven't even touched

276
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:22,018
your steamed pushpins.

277
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:24,943
Aah!

278
00:12:40,562 --> 00:12:42,313
Aah! Oh!

279
00:12:42,398 --> 00:12:44,908
Eh?

280
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,694
Aah!

281
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:59,471
Mm. Mm...

282
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:01,729
Look alive, people.
The big boss

283
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,053
wants to see everyone
for a meeting.

284
00:13:03,137 --> 00:13:06,373
Krusty's here? But we don't tape
for another eight minutes.

285
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:09,203
I just wanted to tell you
how grateful I am

286
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:10,555
for all your hard work.

287
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,557
I never knew
doing a television show

288
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:15,560
could require so little effort
on my part.

289
00:13:15,644 --> 00:13:19,138
If anyone needs anything,
I'll be in my spray tan tent.

290
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:21,733
Thanks, Krusty.
You earned it.

291
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:24,627
Back to work. We need
50 branded segment ideas

292
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:28,055
for Menopause Chapstick and
something called Cereal Wine.

293
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,946
At this solemn and holy moment,

294
00:13:33,031 --> 00:13:34,449
I baptize thee...

295
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:41,449
How are we supposed
to do surprise makeovers

296
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:42,738
on the mailmen you brought in?

297
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,956
Every one of them
is already gorgeous.

298
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,884
Shh!

299
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:50,556
Special thanks to
the Pre-K Pop and Lock Crew.

300
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:55,519
- That was great.
- It was fine.

301
00:13:55,644 --> 00:13:57,176
I mean, look me in the eye

302
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,163
and tell me where the GIF was.
Tell me.

303
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:02,941
Uh, uh, uh, when
the little kid break danced.

304
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:04,442
Um, excuse me, Marge,

305
00:14:04,526 --> 00:14:07,445
there seems to be an emergency
at your house.

306
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:10,281
What is so important
that you pulled me out of work?

307
00:14:10,365 --> 00:14:12,358
Marge, there's no emergency.

308
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:14,860
Have a seat.
This is an intervention.

309
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,791
I missed the big reveal?
You said I had time.

310
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,534
Midge, go out and come back in.

311
00:14:21,618 --> 00:14:24,128
Aw, nah, forget that.
Who's that even for?

312
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:27,056
All right, all right,
intervention. And, uh, go.

313
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,192
If this is about
the melatonin gummies,

314
00:14:29,276 --> 00:14:31,360
I can stop whenever I want.

315
00:14:31,444 --> 00:14:32,862
No, Marge.
We're interventioning

316
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:34,621
you and your whole deal.

317
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:36,474
I never thought
I'd speak ill of TV,

318
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:38,977
but I think it's destroying you.

319
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:41,980
Mm-hmm.

320
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,923
Cut to commercial.

321
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:50,396
Okay, let's make this quick.
Everybody say your little thing.

322
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,473
We're just
worried about you, Marge.

323
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:55,551
Look, even your best friend
Luann is here.

324
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:56,995
Best friend?

325
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,997
We haven't
had the conversation yet,

326
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:00,761
but it's unspoken.

327
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:03,226
Mom, we want to be supportive
of your dreams,

328
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,925
but you just don't
seem to be enjoying it anymore.

329
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,261
Oh, I'm sorry.

330
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,900
Sorry that
you're all so threatened

331
00:15:10,984 --> 00:15:12,918
by a powerful, successful woman.

332
00:15:13,002 --> 00:15:16,497
Lisa, as a feminist, you should
be ashamed of yourself.

333
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:19,091
Really?
Just this week the show's done

334
00:15:19,175 --> 00:15:21,577
"sext your way
out of traffic school"

335
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:25,339
and debuted a new daily segment
called "trends in cleavage."

336
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:28,693
When's this show on again?

337
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:29,859
Mm?

338
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:35,591
The Internet's on fire
about our story

339
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:38,352
exposing the toxic
work environment at<i> Krusty.</i>

340
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:41,039
- Inexcusable.
- I heard they made all the interns

341
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:43,282
convert to Judaism
and work on Christmas,

342
00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:45,376
then convert back
and work on Passover.

343
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,528
Mm-hmm.

344
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:49,380
This is a disaster.

345
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:52,366
We can finish
this dumb thing later.

346
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,720
Hmm. So, um,
what's the move here?

347
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:57,797
Well, is there anything else
we can work on?

348
00:15:57,881 --> 00:15:58,931
Hey Homer, how's the drinking?

349
00:15:59,015 --> 00:16:00,449
Same.

350
00:16:08,003 --> 00:16:09,550
What the hell is this?

351
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:12,628
For the first time in my life,
I'm not responsible

352
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:16,148
for a toxic work environment.
I'm barely ever here.

353
00:16:16,232 --> 00:16:17,967
Physically,
and certainly not mentally.

354
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:19,393
Don't worry, Krusty.

355
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:22,138
I'm going to find whoever said
it's terrible to work here

356
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:25,416
and personally bully them until
their hair falls out in clumps.

357
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,661
But what you need now
is a redemption episode.

358
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:31,255
And I know I speak
for the entire staff when I say

359
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:34,092
we're willing to pull an
all-nighter to make it happen.

360
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:38,096
Aah!

361
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,598
Yeah, and you'll write me
one of those apologies

362
00:16:40,682 --> 00:16:42,491
where it sounds like I'm sorry
but I'm not actually

363
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:44,660
taking the blame for anything?

364
00:16:44,744 --> 00:16:46,846
I've done hundreds of these.
It's actually a template

365
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,605
in the software we use.

366
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:51,442
Uh, what else?

367
00:16:51,526 --> 00:16:54,003
Bart, you got to be addicted
to something by now.

368
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:55,521
None of your business.

369
00:16:55,605 --> 00:16:57,340
Fair enough.

374
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:09,518
I was devastated
to learn that our show

375
00:17:09,602 --> 00:17:12,296
has become
a toxic work environment.

376
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,799
Well, even though
I knew absolutely nothing

377
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:18,469
about what was going on,
the buck stops with me.

378
00:17:18,553 --> 00:17:22,198
And I promise you, I'm going
to take some time to listen,

379
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:26,403
learn, not touch, and listen.

380
00:17:27,954 --> 00:17:30,222
What the hell is this?!

381
00:17:30,306 --> 00:17:32,208
How am I supposed
to do the salad shake

382
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:34,727
if it's not
in its original container?

383
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:36,154
Aah!

384
00:17:38,573 --> 00:17:40,324
Oh, my God.

385
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:42,575
What have I become?

386
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:51,560
I was completely unaware
of the following policies:

387
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:53,171
If employees see me in my car,

388
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:55,247
they must lower
imaginary sunglasses

389
00:17:55,331 --> 00:17:57,416
as if impressed and aroused.

390
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,568
Krusty, you don't
need to do this.

391
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:01,587
The world needs to know the truth.

392
00:18:01,671 --> 00:18:04,498
It's the system of daytime TV
that's toxic.

393
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:06,517
It's turned us all into monsters

394
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:08,260
fueled by stress, gas lighting,

395
00:18:08,344 --> 00:18:10,855
and $15 kale Caesar salads.

396
00:18:10,939 --> 00:18:13,340
The pressure to crank out
so much nice

397
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:15,584
brings out the worst in us.

398
00:18:15,668 --> 00:18:18,771
We just wanted to bring
more nice in the world.

399
00:18:18,855 --> 00:18:20,865
More nice.

400
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:22,925
Okay, new speech.

401
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,260
This non-apology apology

402
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:26,853
just became a real apology.

403
00:18:26,937 --> 00:18:28,021
This place isn't toxic

404
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:30,565
because of whoever this lady is

405
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:32,543
or "the system."

406
00:18:32,627 --> 00:18:35,120
It's toxic because of me.

407
00:18:35,204 --> 00:18:37,122
I'm a showbiz monster.

408
00:18:37,206 --> 00:18:39,032
I'm not nice.

409
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:41,034
So I'm stepping away
from the show...

410
00:18:41,118 --> 00:18:42,720
forever.

411
00:18:42,804 --> 00:18:44,113
Wha?

412
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:46,999
Krusty. Krusty,
you don't have to do this.

413
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,467
It's not your fault.

414
00:18:48,551 --> 00:18:50,561
Look, lady, I couldn't
agree with you more.

415
00:18:50,645 --> 00:18:53,397
Everyone who works here
except me is nuts.

416
00:18:53,481 --> 00:18:56,400
I just quit because I closed
the deal for a new gig

417
00:18:56,484 --> 00:18:58,552
which makes
daytime talk show money

418
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:00,887
look like late night
talk show money.

419
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:03,074
TV judge syndication money.

420
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:04,467
A judge?

421
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:08,061
Judge Judy is the richest
TV star in the world.

422
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:10,081
So I'm gonna be Judge Krusty.

423
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:13,066
I can let my body go,
just sit on my keister

424
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,402
and speak truth
to stupid all day.

425
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:18,923
All right, I got to go
work on my humiliation quips.

426
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:20,758
You ever do any bailiffing?

427
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:21,759
Some.

428
00:19:21,843 --> 00:19:23,593
No more show?

429
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:27,638
I'm... I'm free.

430
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:31,010
Oh come on,
why would you do that?

431
00:19:31,094 --> 00:19:33,436
Sorry, Pat, sorry, sorry.

432
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:35,922
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

433
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:37,166
Don't sneeze on my robe

434
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,184
and tell me I'm in a car wash.

435
00:19:39,268 --> 00:19:41,186
Did you fall out
of the stupid tree

436
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,096
and land in the idiot mulch?

437
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,931
His quips could use some work.

438
00:19:45,015 --> 00:19:46,525
Mulch.

439
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:48,935
Do you ever miss
working in TV, Mom?

440
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:52,181
There was at least a week there
where you seemed to enjoy it.

441
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:54,608
Sure, it was
rewarding at first.

442
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:56,794
But this experience
has made me realize

443
00:19:56,878 --> 00:20:01,023
my real dream job
is producing this family.

444
00:20:01,107 --> 00:20:02,449
And now, as a consultant,

445
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:05,027
I get the best of both worlds.

446
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:08,715
Marge, it's Drew.
I need your help.

447
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,883
I got no A block for tomorrow.

448
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:12,493

450
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:16,632
The one who raises baby ducks?

451
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:20,486
Yes, I'm thinking
surprise spa day for him.

452
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:22,998
And an extreme pond makeover
for the ducks.

453
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,410
Oh, Marge, are you sure
you won't come work for me?

454
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:28,277
That's very sweet, Drew,

455
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:30,632
but my daytime days are over.

456
00:20:33,517 --> 00:20:35,600
Oh...

457
00:20:36,584 --> 00:20:37,926
I'll be in touch.
