1
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:09,609
D'oh!

2
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:32,777
I am so excited for
the scout jamboree this weekend.

3
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:35,554
Dad, hand over the family bugle!

4
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,890
Here she is!

5
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:38,972
Old Blowy.

6
00:00:40,158 --> 00:00:43,045
Hmm?

7
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:45,046
What? You're not a boy!

8
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,957
You can't join
the Boy Explorers!

9
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:48,884
And that's a flugelhorn!

10
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:51,052
Yes. It's the hardest horn.

11
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:53,054
And, FYI, I did join.

12
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,633
And I already have
three badges...

13
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:56,909
Environmentalism,

14
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:57,984
badge-receiving,

15
00:00:58,009 --> 00:00:59,912
and sibling rivalry.

16
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:01,581
Come on, you two...

17
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:03,990
<i>Attention, corporate overlords,</i>

18
00:01:04,015 --> 00:01:06,402
<i>we are Pseudo-nonymous,</i>

19
00:01:06,426 --> 00:01:09,480
<i>and we have taken over
this broadcast.</i>

20
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:12,650
We are the anarchist collective
of nameless hacktivists

21
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:15,653
who published the internal
emails of Waffle House

22
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:19,265
and brought Home Depot's
"Find a store near you" feature

23
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:21,158
to its knees.

24
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:25,254
Now we have hacked into
the Disney Corporation's servers

25
00:01:25,277 --> 00:01:29,275
and seized hundreds of hours
of never-before-aired footage

26
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:32,277
from the television show
<i>The Simpsons.</i>

27
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,763
Stories so ill-conceived,

28
00:01:34,787 --> 00:01:36,265
so idiotic

29
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:38,343
that their exposure
would destroy

30
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:41,454
the value
of the very I.P. itself.

31
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:45,625
Until we are paid a ransom
of $20 million in Bitcoin,

32
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:48,853
we will air
these show-destroying scenes

33
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:50,129
one after another,

34
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:52,278
starting now.

35
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,137
No, no, it can't be true!

36
00:01:57,161 --> 00:01:58,972
It is true, Carl.

37
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:01,048
There never was a Lenny.

38
00:02:01,072 --> 00:02:04,718
So Lenny was just a figment
of my imagination?

39
00:02:04,742 --> 00:02:06,311
I... I made him up?

40
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,463
Yeah, your psyche
created "Lenny"

41
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:10,984
to help you deal
with a terrible trauma there.

42
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:14,653
- What trauma?
- Finding out your previous
best friend wasn't real.

43
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:16,322
It's kind of a thing with you.

44
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:19,658
Huh. Hey, I haven't seen you
in here before.

45
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,385
I'm Carl. What's your name?

46
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,145
Nice to meet you, Steven.

47
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:25,135
Aw, crap, here we go again.

48
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,835
Now you see
we mean business, Disney.

49
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:32,579
You will submit $20 million
in Bitcoin to our crypto wallet

50
00:02:32,603 --> 00:02:34,731
at the following address.

51
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:36,082
Until the payment arrives,

52
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:38,752
we will keep playing
these nonsensical clips

53
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:41,076
no one was ever meant to see.

54
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,000
What's his name?

55
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:46,186
Number Eight.

56
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,617
I mean, Santa's Little Helper.

57
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:53,175
Greetings,
lamewads from the past!

58
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,512
I have come back in time to
reveal the events of the future,

59
00:02:56,536 --> 00:02:59,180
so that you can amaze the world

60
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:03,276
with your uncannily accurate
predictions!

61
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,371
Less yelling, more foretelling.

62
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:07,615
My first shocking prediction is,

63
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,099
in 2016,

64
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:12,652
the Nobel Prize in Economics
will go to...

65
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:14,622
Bengt R. HolmstrÃ¶m!

66
00:03:14,646 --> 00:03:17,123
Why would anyone care
if we predicted that?

67
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:18,384
I don't know, but they will.

68
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:20,127
Do you have anything
a little more...

69
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:22,112
oh, impressive?

70
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:23,705
Donald Trump
is gonna be president.

71
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:26,558
Less impressive!
Less impressive!

72
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:29,787
Okay, let's see. You're gonna
want to mention gas hoarding,

73
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:30,896
pandemics,

74
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,974
Germany beats Brazil
in the 2014 World Cup,

75
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:35,216
Disney buys Fox.

76
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,051
And then they both go under?!

77
00:03:37,075 --> 00:03:39,463
No, they're both absorbed
by Panda Express.

78
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:42,074
Pretty much everything now
is Panda Express.

79
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:43,558
- That makes sense.
- I get it.

80
00:03:43,582 --> 00:03:45,599
Ooh! Orange chicken.

81
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:52,901
Arr.

82
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:54,978
Yarr.

83
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,421
Aye.

84
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,966
- Yarr!
- Aye!

85
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:01,593
Yarr?

86
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,075
Aye.

87
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:08,009
Yarr!

88
00:04:08,032 --> 00:04:09,373
Aye!

89
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,681
Aye?

90
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:15,591
Yarr.

91
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:16,684
Aye?

92
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:17,716
Yarr!

93
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:20,279
Aye?

94
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:21,187
Yarr!

95
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:24,007
- Aye! Aye!
- Yarr! Yarr!

96
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,552
- Aye!
- Yarr!

97
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,310
Aye!

98
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:30,180
Aye!

99
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,848
Yarr.

100
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,206
Yarr.

101
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:38,110
<i>-Yarr, yarr, yarr, yarr...!</i>
<i>-Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye,</i>
<i>- aye, aye, aye, aye, aye!</i>

102
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,492
Till the morrow, chums!

103
00:04:51,576 --> 00:04:53,387
Is that you, babe?

104
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:55,706
Yeah, yeah, I'm home.

105
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,466
- Daddy! Daddy! How was school?
- Hey.

106
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,653
It ain't school for Daddy,
sweetheart.

107
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:01,879
It's work.

108
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:05,065
Soul-sucking, grueling work.

109
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:06,475
Then why don't you quit?

110
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:09,052
Always with the quitting,
this one.

111
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,514
I can't do that, Doreen!

112
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:16,002
The police department
needs someone inside the school!

113
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:18,004
So why's it got to be you?

114
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:19,079
Look at me, Didi.

115
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:21,081
I'm the only 36-year-old

116
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:23,084
who can pass for ten!

117
00:05:23,108 --> 00:05:25,086
How 'bout passing
for a good father?

118
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,586
The kids hardly know you.

119
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,682
You're out every afternoon
till 3:00 p.m.

120
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:31,742
4:00 if there's chess club.

121
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,019
You think I want to be there?

122
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:34,670
Martin likes chess!

123
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:36,211
Not me!

124
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:41,865
I don't know where Martin ends
and my Reggie begins!

125
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,702
Aw, maybe you're right.

126
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,538
Maybe I am in too deep.

127
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:55,875
It's just, when I was diagnosed
with... this,

128
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:58,269
I said,
"I'm not gonna let it beat me.

129
00:05:58,293 --> 00:06:00,286
I'm gonna use it for good!"

130
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,882
I'm doing good, aren't I?

131
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:04,050
You are, Reg.

132
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:06,944
You're a great role model
for your kids.

133
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:08,887
All three of 'em.

134
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,781
You mean...?

135
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:11,896
I do.

136
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:15,119
They still
haven't paid the ransom.

137
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:17,545
Did they not see
the nonsense we just released?

138
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:19,624
How is Martin Prince
an adult cop?

139
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:21,901
Well, maybe I overestimated

140
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:23,978
how much
Disney cares about Lenny.

141
00:06:24,002 --> 00:06:25,737
No, it's not your fault.

142
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:28,240
You're the finest
digital terrorist I know.

143
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:31,985
Your malware shut down the
Portland Airport for two weeks.

144
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:35,156
Everyone missed Thanksgiving.

145
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,417
It's sweet you remembered.

146
00:06:37,441 --> 00:06:40,978
Aw, you're sweet, too.

147
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:42,754
We should probably get back
to...

148
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,740
blackmailing
the major corporation.

149
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:48,002
Wait! Why did the voice-changing
app switch off?

150
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:51,413
Bollocks. I didn't upgrade
to the premium edition,

151
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:53,990
and the free trial period
ran out, I'm afraid.

152
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,768
I am so daft.

153
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:57,418
Oh, my God, you're British?

154
00:06:57,442 --> 00:07:01,014
That must be delightful
for your wife or girlfriend.

155
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:02,591
Oh, no, I'm painfully single.

156
00:07:02,615 --> 00:07:05,110
Nary a romantic appointment
in my "shed-you-ul."

157
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:07,021
Say that last part again.

158
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:09,281
You mean... "shed-you-ul"?

159
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:12,117
Shed-you-ul.

160
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,100
Shed-you-ul.

161
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:21,351
Oh! We're back on! We're live!

162
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,403
Well, I-I suppose we should
threaten them some more.

163
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:26,966
How about I just run another
batch of show-ruining clips

164
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,192
so we can...

165
00:07:28,216 --> 00:07:30,117
Topple the capitalist system

166
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:31,786
and its bought-and-paid-for...

167
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,579
Political enablers.

168
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:43,713
<i>Do you speak English?</i>

169
00:07:49,237 --> 00:07:52,262
We're trapped! Someone get help!

170
00:07:57,687 --> 00:08:00,891
<i>I can't help
if I can't understand you.</i>

171
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:03,149
Won't anyone do something?!

172
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,707
<i>Never mind.</i>

173
00:08:23,194 --> 00:08:24,749
Let me get this straight.

174
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:28,694
You mowed down all that corn
to build a football field,

175
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:31,863
hoping it would lure
the ghosts of former players

176
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,923
down from football heaven?

177
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,307
Uh-huh. And look!

178
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,206
Hey, I don't recognize
any of these guys.

179
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,951
Why are there two 50-yard lines?

180
00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:45,211
Aw, damn it!

181
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:47,360
I built a Canadian field!

182
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:49,774
Oh. Sorry, hoser.

183
00:08:49,798 --> 00:08:50,716
My bad, eh?

184
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,201
Hey, nice rouge there, Gordo.

185
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:55,202
Hey, Homer!
Throw you a Hail Mary?

186
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:57,452
Shut up, Flutie.

187
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:02,787
Uh, yes.
The day is Sol, uh, 150.

188
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:04,879
I am stranded on Mars.

189
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:09,051
I suspect my fellow astronauts
left me behind on purpose,

190
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:10,794
as from the bathroom

191
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,797
I did hear the giggling
and the shushing

192
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:16,299
and the "Blast off quick
before he's done tinkling."

193
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:19,820
I have a mere three days
of air and water remaining.

194
00:09:19,844 --> 00:09:22,248
There is no hope.

195
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:24,250
Unless
I glayvenate the hydrogen,

196
00:09:24,274 --> 00:09:25,750
flavenize the oxygen,

197
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,511
and, yes, yes,
poopulate the soil!

198
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:31,649
It was a simple matter
of applying pseudoscience

199
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:35,501
and phantasmagorical engineering
to the problem. Yes.

200
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:38,413
Oh, yes, I also cloned myself
for company.

201
00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:40,581
And my fellow Frinks
have built us all

202
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:42,605
an escape rocket.
Isn't that wonderful?

203
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:47,019
Leaving!

204
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:51,090
Aw, flayvin me in the glayvin!

205
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,428
Hello. This is Homer Simpson.

206
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:56,448
From the bottom of my heart,
I apologize

207
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:59,692
to the great, great,
great people of Finland

208
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:00,769
for what I said.

209
00:10:00,793 --> 00:10:02,770
I have done many, many,

210
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:04,865
many, many,<i> many</i> episodes,

211
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:06,850
and in one of those... just one...

212
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,610
I mixed you up with Norway.

213
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:13,115
And I have so, so, so,<i> so,</i>
so much love and respect for...

214
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:15,024
I think "Finns"
is what you're called.

215
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,784
And if I ever... I mean ever...

216
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:18,544
Ever, ever,<i> ever</i> thought

217
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:20,380
that an innocent slip
of the tongue

218
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:21,974
is something
that an entire nation

219
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:23,291
could get worked up about,

220
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:25,536
I would've kept my mouth shut.

221
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:29,315
And the scary, scary, scary,
oh-so-scary lawyers

222
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,650
of the giant, giant...
I mean giant...

223
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:35,211
So, so giant,
scary corporation I work for

224
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,822
would not have had to draft
this statement.

225
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,216
God bless you

226
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,994
and all the peoples
of South America,

227
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:44,721
for you are a... What?

228
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,981
What do you mean
I have to record it again?

229
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:48,188
What did I say?

230
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:57,234
You're chewing too loud.

231
00:10:57,258 --> 00:10:59,919
From now on,
only two chews per bite.

232
00:10:59,943 --> 00:11:02,663
One, two, swallow.
One, two, swallow.

233
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:07,250
I think I've misplaced
my appetite, mother.

234
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:13,172
I need to see you right now.

235
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,181
I deserve this.

236
00:11:19,205 --> 00:11:21,431
I deserve to feel like a man.

237
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:26,205
Only with you
do I truly feel alive.

238
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:28,707
I made this just for you.

239
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:31,043
Thank you, Mother.

240
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:35,605
Anything for my son.
I am so proud of you.

241
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,216
Oh, Mommy.
I can't wait another second.

242
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,907
You know I need it.

243
00:12:00,004 --> 00:12:01,856
I almost forgot
to give you this.

244
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,722
Leave it on the dresser.

245
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:09,914
If only that were
my real mother.

246
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:14,317
If only that were my real son.

247
00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:20,592
I don't mean to be
unneighborly, but, uh,

248
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:23,486
you wouldn't know what happened
to my old nostril skirt?

249
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,341
Mustache you say?
Hmm, let me think.

250
00:12:27,365 --> 00:12:30,769
Stroking this goatee
I've always had.

251
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:32,437
Stroking, stroking...

252
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:36,107
That's it.
Boys, we're Jewish now.

253
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,633
<i>- L'chaim!</i>
- To life!

254
00:12:41,044 --> 00:12:42,782
Mmm.

255
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:44,950
From bun to pickle,
a masterpiece.

256
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:49,455
The exquisite flavor is matched
only by the peerless mouthfeel.

257
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:50,847
Five stars.

258
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,350
Bravo, Harvey Comics, bravo.

259
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:55,852
A stunning addition
to the Casper-verse.

260
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:57,778
No notes. Ten stars.

261
00:12:57,802 --> 00:13:00,282
With this level of
sour cream in your blood,

262
00:13:00,306 --> 00:13:03,210
your brain is completely
starved of oxygen.

263
00:13:03,234 --> 00:13:05,528
Consequently, you're a moron.

264
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:09,048
A perfect explanation.
Succinct and devastating.

265
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:10,809
Infinite stars!

266
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:15,503
Best. Diagnosis. Ev...

267
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:21,986
Give me a beer, pally.

268
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,989
Hey, I know you, don't I?

269
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:26,549
Nah, must be thinking
of someone else, slim.

270
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,811
No, I've definitely seen
you around town.

271
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:30,995
Sign here, chief.

272
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,813
Here's your passport, gorgeous.

273
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:34,740
Brake pads are shot, tough guy.

274
00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:36,150
Want that toasted, honcho?

275
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:37,911
Found your car keys, big shot.

276
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:39,337
Those were all you!

277
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,173
I don't know
what to tell you, slick.

278
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:43,530
Just got that sort of face.

279
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,681
Pally-pally-pally-pally-pally-

280
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:53,624
pally-pally-pally-pally-pally-
pally-pally-pally-pally-pally...

281
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:02,844
- Oh, my God, you're beautiful.
- You're more beautiful!

282
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:04,254
Oh. Oh, dear.

283
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:07,423
The world has seen
our exquisite symmetrical faces.

284
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,684
Then they've also seen
that we're... in love?

285
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,928
My God. Yes.

286
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,855
Yes, that's what it is,
isn't it?

287
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,615
It is. It is stunning.

288
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,784
As stunning as this list
of abandoned episodes

289
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:22,528
that started as clever titles
and went nowhere.

290
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:26,610
âª <i>Hopin' for the dream</i> âª

291
00:14:26,634 --> 00:14:27,961
âª <i>Hopin'</i> âª

292
00:14:27,985 --> 00:14:30,722
âª <i>Focus like a laser beam</i> âª

293
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:34,118
âª <i>I'll keep fighting</i>
<i>till I want something great</i> âª

294
00:14:34,142 --> 00:14:37,125
âª <i>Hopin' for a dream</i> âª

295
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:42,975
âª <i>Hopin' for a dream</i> âª

296
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,388
- âª<i> Hopin'</i> âª
- âª<i> To someday,</i>
<i>somehow have a goal</i> âª

297
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:47,552
âª <i>I'll keep fight...</i> âª

298
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,225
Are we crazy?

299
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:52,635
Can two people,
forbidden from sharing

300
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:56,306
any personal information,
really make a life together?

301
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,250
I do think we owe it
to each other to try,

302
00:14:58,274 --> 00:15:00,476
um... whoever you are.

303
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,903
I can't wait

304
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:05,446
until we're
Mr. and Mrs. Redacted.

305
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,761
Surrender, hacker scum!

306
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:13,248
If we're going down,
we'll take<i> The Simpsons</i> with us.

307
00:15:13,272 --> 00:15:16,456
I'm gonna play the dog scene.

308
00:15:20,538 --> 00:15:22,421
Good morning, Homer.

309
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,759
It's morning?!

310
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,787
We've got
you cyberterrorists surrounded.

311
00:15:34,811 --> 00:15:36,104
This is it, darling.

312
00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:38,105
I've cued up the very
worst-of-the-worst clips

313
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:39,365
to play one by one.

314
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:42,293
When we push this button,
<i>The Simpsons</i> dies.

315
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,735
- Together, then?
- Together.

316
00:15:46,638 --> 00:15:49,209
The lies... stop... now.

317
00:15:49,232 --> 00:15:50,876
Aah!

318
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,120
I know Eddie is Ralph's father.

319
00:15:53,144 --> 00:15:55,548
Look at the hair.
Look at the hair!

320
00:15:55,572 --> 00:15:58,368
No, Clancy,
I swear to you it's not true.

321
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:01,647
My son's breath
smells like cat food.

322
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:03,169
Okay, you got me.

323
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:08,299
I'll have the veal.

324
00:16:09,195 --> 00:16:12,754
The lies... stop... now!

325
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,220
I did a DNA test.

326
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:17,903
I'm not your son.

327
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:19,905
Luann, how could you?!

328
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:21,575
I'm not hers either.

329
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:24,152
We're not your parents?

330
00:16:24,176 --> 00:16:25,729
- All right.
- Oh, thank God!

331
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:28,320
- Yes!
- Oh...

332
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:32,677
The lies... stop... now.

333
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,238
Ow!

334
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,181
Marge,

335
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:38,182
I'm not your sister.

336
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,851
I'm... your mother.

337
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,836
But... but... wait, what?

338
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,115
I was young and briefly hot.
It was a different time.

339
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,753
Back then, we solved things
with huge lies.

340
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:52,105
Then, who was my real father?

341
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:55,259
His name was Disco...

342
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:58,110
Disco...

343
00:16:58,134 --> 00:17:00,727
Disco who? Disco Who?

344
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,881
The lies... stop... now!

345
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,121
Rake-y, I'm not
your real father.

346
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:11,275
And I'm not Scottish, I'm Welsh!

347
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:14,200
Oh, don't turn your back on me.

348
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,280
âª

349
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:19,633
<i>T-minus one minute to launch.</i>

350
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:22,560
Ooh.

351
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:24,288
All for you, baby.

352
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:26,047
Aah!

353
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,217
Aah! Aah!

354
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,886
âª <i>We are the jockeys,</i>
<i>jockeys are we</i> âª

355
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:37,057
âª <i>We live underground</i>
<i>in a fiberglass tree.</i> âª

356
00:17:37,082 --> 00:17:38,766
<i>Opa!</i>

357
00:17:48,926 --> 00:17:52,320
It's still me on the inside.

358
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:59,494
Sin-ner! Sin-ner!

359
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:05,104
Oh, Homie. You're awake.

360
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,497
- What happened?
- You've been in a coma

361
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,442
ever since you tried
to jump Springfield Gorge.

362
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:11,518
How long?

363
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,353
Two days ago.

364
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:16,763
Two days? But...
I had so many adventures.

365
00:18:16,788 --> 00:18:18,282
More than 700.

366
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:22,346
Those were all coma dreams.
None of them ever happened.

367
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,627
The "B" stories, too?

368
00:18:26,056 --> 00:18:28,868
I never had a pet lobster?

369
00:18:28,893 --> 00:18:30,962
I never went to space?

370
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:34,229
What about the Halloweens?!

371
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:37,285
Drop your code and move away
from the Internet!

372
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:38,878
You're both under arrest.

373
00:18:38,903 --> 00:18:41,306
On what charge,
grand theft heart?

374
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,307
Conspiracy to commit to love?

375
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:46,385
Willfully endangering
each other's loneliness?

376
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,980
Take one more step
and I'll blow this I.P.

377
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:51,150
to Magic Kingdom come.

378
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:53,894
Go ahead. You've already
released all the<i> Simpsons</i> files.

379
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:55,211
No one cared.

380
00:18:55,236 --> 00:18:56,471
The only people still
watching that show

381
00:18:56,494 --> 00:18:59,140
are football fans who
passed out with the TV on.

382
00:18:59,163 --> 00:19:01,884
I am not talking
about<i> The Simpsons.</i>

383
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:03,978
We've hacked into all of Disney.

384
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:07,165
That means<i> Star Wars,</i>
Marvel, Pixar.

385
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,500
We've even got...

386
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,484
Nat Geo.

387
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:11,818
You monsters.

388
00:19:11,843 --> 00:19:14,897
If I press this button,
the only Hulk that exists

389
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:16,566
will be Edward Norton.

390
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:19,160
It'll be like Ruffalo
never happened.

391
00:19:19,183 --> 00:19:20,569
You're bluffing.

392
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:23,015
I'll delete Baby Groot,
Baby Yoda,

393
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,910
and their brand-new
top secret character...

394
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,686
Baby Jeff Goldblum.

395
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:31,914
<i>On the one hand, uh, "goo,"</i>

396
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:38,011
<i>but I'd be remiss if I didn't
also mention, uh, "gaa."</i>

397
00:19:38,036 --> 00:19:39,681
<i>Oh, my golly.</i>

398
00:19:39,704 --> 00:19:42,259
<i>It's me as a baby.</i>

399
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:44,184
Good God, she's not bluffing.

400
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:46,096
Stand down. Let 'em go.

401
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,208
I'll do it.

402
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,934
Um... we now return you
to your regularly

403
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,528
"shed-you-uled" programming.

404
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:54,567
Oh.

405
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:58,625
How do you lose two children?!

406
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:01,557
What kind of jamboree
are you running here?

407
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:06,471
Yeah, you're back.

408
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:10,303
Ew.

409
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:13,231
When we get home,
can we turn on the TV

410
00:20:13,256 --> 00:20:17,384
and never, ever go
outdoors again?

411
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:20,239
- Please?
- Pretty please?

412
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:23,575
I've never been
prouder of you two.

413
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:24,984
While you were gone,

414
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:26,411
your mom and I
almost got divorced

415
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,229
over something insignificant.

416
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:30,915
Luckily, your dad apologized.

417
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,992
Yup, I got it down
at this point.

418
00:20:33,017 --> 00:20:35,436
It's all about the eye contact.

419
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:37,588
He knows what works.

Maybe we didn't get the Bitcoin,

424
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,330
but we've got each other.

425
00:20:54,355 --> 00:20:55,606
Oh, darling,
I think we should do it,

426
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,852
I think we should tell
each other our real names.

427
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,428
My name is Ashley.

428
00:21:00,451 --> 00:21:02,614
No! So is mine.

429
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,007
- Oh...
- Ashley.

430
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,191
Oh, Ashley.

431
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:08,683
- Ashley, Ashley.
- Oh, oh, British Ashley. Mmm...

432
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,455
Shh!
