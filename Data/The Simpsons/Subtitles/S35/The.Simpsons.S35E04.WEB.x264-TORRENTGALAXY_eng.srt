Who also sees the glory
that is montgomery burns.

176
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:24,128
<i> now it was up to persephone</i>

177
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:25,880
<i>To create a working prototype of</i>

178
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:28,049
<i> Her amazing</i>
<i> desalination technology.</i>

179
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:29,968
The water in front of you
comes from

180
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:31,886
The functional prototype of

181
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:34,013
The lifeboat
desalination machine.

182
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:35,682
So everyone please raise a glass

183
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:38,768
To milestone
this history-defining moment.

184
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:43,565
Oh, no, you can't
drink it now. No.

185
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:46,609
Our competitors could steal
the proprietary aquatech

186
00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:47,735
In your urine.

187
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,865
And just in case any of
our patented evaporated mist

188
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:54,284
Made it into your bladders,

189
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:57,320
We've arranged to have you all
catheterized.

190
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:04,252
So lifeboat was just following
the tech industry playbook:

191
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:06,212
Fake it till you make it.

192
00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:09,299
Or as I call it,
"lie-po until you ipo."

193
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:12,719
But the employees were already
dreaming of cashing out.

194
00:09:12,804 --> 00:09:14,637
Tech salaries are the greatest.

195
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:17,140
This week, I gave marge
200 stock options

196
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:18,766
To go grocery shopping.

197
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:20,059
It didn't work at all.

198
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:22,895
I had to put all the food
back on the shelves.

199
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:24,856
<i> meanwhile,</i>
<i> the newly minted tech workers</i>

200
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,151
<i> Were adapting to a much</i>
<i> different corporate culture.</i>

201
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:30,903
At the new company,
people were so secretive

202
00:09:31,031 --> 00:09:33,615
They actually moved the post-it
notes with their passwords

203
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,241
Off their monitor.

204
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,747
<i> Workers were getting fired</i>
<i> every day.</i>

205
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:44,334
That tattoo is the intellectual
property of the company.

206
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,881
The whole company got
so paranoid.

207
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:51,966
Because of those ndas he signed,

208
00:09:52,052 --> 00:09:55,136
Homer couldn't even tell me
how his day was.

209
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:57,263
I can neither confirm nor deny
I had a day.

210
00:09:57,349 --> 00:09:59,807
Well, it was strange
they wouldn't let me

211
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:02,560
Look inside the machines,
since my title was

212
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:06,314
Chief engineer of
inside the machine.

213
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:08,232
<i>And whenever a reporter came by,</i>

214
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,028

<i> to cover something up.</i>

215
00:10:12,155 --> 00:10:16,115
Well, still better than working
for zuckerberg!

216
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:19,702
They were hiding something, and
it was really freaking me out.

217
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:21,120
So I emailed persephone.

218
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:23,539
And the next day, carl was gone.

242

Is that evidence that
you're in a kind of cult

243
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,146
And won't hear any criticism
of your leader?

244
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:30,189
Yes, I am in a cult.

245
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:32,316
It's called a marriage.

246
00:11:32,402 --> 00:11:35,278
My wife is the head of it,

00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:24,900
<i> But still has more salt</i>
<i> than all the glasses</i>

348
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:26,152
<i> In margaritaville.</i>

349
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,946
Oh, my god.
Lifeboat is built on a lie,

350
00:16:29,032 --> 00:16:31,157
And persephone is a fraud.

351
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:32,992
But her merch is...

352
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:34,452
solid.

353
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:36,037
<i> action was needed,</i>

354
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:38,748
<i>And island time was running out.</i>

355
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,291
<i>The fateful demo day had arrived</i>

356
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:42,877
<i> For lifeboat to</i>
<i> finally prove its concept</i>

357
00:16:42,962 --> 00:16:44,795
<i> At springfield elementary.</i>

358
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:47,214
<i> The school's drinking water</i>
<i> had been replaced</i>

359
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:48,883
<i> With lifeboat liquid--</i>

360
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:51,343
<i> Jab-a-tose-infused salt water.</i>

361
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:54,638
<i> Lifeboat employees had drunk</i>
<i> the kool-aid,</i>

362
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:57,516
<i> And now it was being served up</i>
<i> to the children.</i>

363
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:58,601
Mr. Burns!

364
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,102
The lifeboat water isn't safe.

365
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:02,480
It's just super sweetened
ocean brine.

366
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:05,441
Nonsense.
My wife is a beautiful genius,

367
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,443
Who succeeds at
everything she touches.

368
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:10,071
And everything she says
makes perfect sense.

369
00:17:10,156 --> 00:17:13,407
The wheel of tomorrow is
an aqua-circle.

370
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:15,117
Let's make it rain.

371
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:16,619
buddy, buddy, buddy.

372
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:19,747
What you're feeling towards
that lady is fresh love,

373
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:20,915
Not married love.

374
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,249
But we<i> are</i> married.

375
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:25,211
Yes, but the married love
hasn't kicked in yet.

376
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:28,005
When it does, you'll see
your spouse's flaws

377
00:17:28,091 --> 00:17:31,717
In 4k hdtv
you can never turn off.

378
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:33,302
What are you driving at?

379
00:17:33,346 --> 00:17:36,889
I think you need to look at
your wife with marriage eyes.

380
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:38,307
Water is the original crypto.

381
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:41,143
Every drop is encoded
on the biological blockchain,

382
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,772
And we are the aquanauts
of the potable future.

383
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:47,191
This is wet 3.0!

384
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:51,061
I don't understand
a thing she's ever said.

385
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:53,155
Now you're married.

386
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:55,449
And since you're seeing things
clearly...

387
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:59,787
Oh, dear. Those children are
going to drink poison.

388
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:01,497
And the bad news is...

389
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,040
I'm going to be liable.

390
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:05,251
liable!

391
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,383
<i>that is what would have happened</i>

392
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,427
<i> Had homer not</i>
<i> turned the valve off.</i>

393
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:20,641
<i>Sorry, we only put that in there</i>
<i> for the trailer.</i>

394
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:22,768
<i> Do you know how hard it is</i>
<i> to get people to watch</i>

395
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:26,147
<i> A documentary that's not about</i>
<i> a small-town murder?</i>

396
00:18:26,232 --> 00:18:27,690
Please, honey, come clean.

397
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:30,276
Your miracle invention is
nothing but claptrap.

398
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,571
If you can just admit that,
maybe we have a chance.

399
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:37,825
Babe, the underlying imaginary
technology still works.

400
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,326
<i> and in that moment,</i>

401
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:43,497
<i> This unlikely and super gross</i>
<i> love affair died.</i>

402
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,626
Yes, I was besotted,
blind to her machinations.

403
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:49,253
She cost me billions.

404
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,213
It wasn't that she was evil,
I love evil.

405
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,300
It's that she still insists
she's good.

406
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,220
<i> lifeboat had finally</i>
<i> hit the reef,</i>

407
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:00,431
<i> Drowning its investors</i>
<i> and employees</i>

408
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:03,893
<i> In poisoned water and</i>
<i> counterparty risk lawsuits.</i>

409
00:19:03,978 --> 00:19:06,478
<i> But to this day,</i>
<i> persephone has refused</i>

410
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,314
<i> To admit any failure.</i>

411
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:11,567
Testing showed your de-salinator
did absolutely nothing,

412
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:14,320
Your company is bankrupt,
and in the divorce,

413
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:17,406
Mr. Burns somehow got
your high school friends.

414
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,077
What happens from here?

415
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:23,537
Well, christiane amanpour,
as you say,

416
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:25,706
Things have never
looked better for the company.

417
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:26,749
I didn't say that.

418
00:19:26,918 --> 00:19:28,083
The reality is,

419
00:19:28,211 --> 00:19:30,294
You're in jail.

420
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,046
Christiane,
have I ever told you about

421
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:35,341
My grandfather's experience
on a lifeboat?

422
00:19:36,177 --> 00:19:37,426
Even that was a lie.

423
00:19:37,586 --> 00:19:39,220
Her grandfather wasn't
in the war,

424
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:40,596
And he didn't die on a lifeboat.

425
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:43,933
He's a cpa whose hobby is
fixing british spellings

426
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,643
On wikipedia.

427
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,483
not only did I miss out

428
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,568
On once-in-a-lifetime
start-up riches,

429
00:19:54,654 --> 00:19:56,987
But I lost the most amazing
woman I ever met.

430
00:19:57,031 --> 00:20:00,282
I think, in a few more months
she might've even slept with me.

431
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:01,700
It's great to meet you in person

432
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:04,870
After seeing so much footage
of you in our documentary

433
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:07,539
<i> The man who sold</i>
<i> horse meat sandwiches.</i>

434
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,751
Anything else to add?

435
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,794
Just this.

436
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:13,254
Don't feel sorry for me.

437
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:15,297
Time to rebuild and reconquer.

438
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:17,925
If I know one thing
about myself,

439
00:20:18,052 --> 00:20:21,637

We also have over 90 hours of

447

Maybe that could be
a documentary, too.

448
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:56,171
I once brought an umbrella
into the shower.

449
00:20:56,257 --> 00:20:58,257
-How did you get clean?
-I didn't,

450
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:01,427
But at least I didn't
have to take off my clothes.

451
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,763
As soon as I open my umbrella,
it stops raining.

452
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:06,432
You need a sunroof on it.

453
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,560
What about a giant umbrella
you keep in the trunk?

454
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:13,522
Sounds like you're talking about
an "umbrellaphant."

455
00:21:13,566 --> 00:21:15,316
Can we get back to work?

456
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,359
Wait. I like the sound of that.

457
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:18,444
Get back.

458
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:20,571
I saw an umbrellaphant
at the circus.

459
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:22,531
He was working for peanuts.
