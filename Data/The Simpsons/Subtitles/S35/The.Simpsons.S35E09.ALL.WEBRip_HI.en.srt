00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,868
- No!
- No!

178
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,812
Lis, I know it looks bad,
but I'm really scared.

179
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:03,515
I swear I didn't do it.

180
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:04,952
I don't know.

181
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:06,690
You've beheaded
many of my dolls,

182
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,962
from Malibu Stacy
to Fire Island Frank.

183
00:08:09,963 --> 00:08:12,333
Oh, those aren't valuable.
They're yours.

184
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:15,273
Bart, you've lied to me
so many times before,

185
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:16,842
how could I ever believe you?

186
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:19,114
Okay, but this time
I'm telling the truth,

187
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,787
and to prove it, I'm gonna
own up to all my past lies.

188
00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:24,057
[inhales sharply]

189
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:25,927
That time when the dog
buried your saxophone

190
00:08:25,928 --> 00:08:27,697
in the garden, he had some help.

191
00:08:27,698 --> 00:08:28,967
When Malala called you
on your birthday

192
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:31,104
to tell you to suck lemons,
that was me.

193
00:08:31,105 --> 00:08:33,476
That time you woke up in
a bathtub full of garlic knots...

194
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:35,279
I get it, I get it.
You're terrible.

195
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,118
Okay, I figure
I only get one time to say,

196
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:41,025
"Lis, you gotta believe me
no matter what."

197
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,395
Right now,
I am playing that card.

198
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:46,602
I did not destroy that doll.

199
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:49,341
Oh, my God. I believe you.

200
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:51,846
- [angry crowd clamoring]
- Oh.

201
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,853
The only way
to clear Bart's name

202
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:57,759
is to figure out
who really did it.

203
00:08:57,859 --> 00:09:00,296
But I can't do it all by myself.
I need help.

204
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,465
I'll help you.

205
00:09:01,565 --> 00:09:03,169
No, hang on,
let me try that again.

206
00:09:03,302 --> 00:09:05,640
I'll help you! Nailed it.

207
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:08,578
Taika Waititi? Seriously?

208
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:10,649
You'll help me
exonerate my brother?

209
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,487
Of course. Why? I'll tell you.

210
00:09:12,587 --> 00:09:13,989
Because I have
a medical condition

211
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,194
where I have to be
multitasking at all times.

212
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:19,366
Well, my brother can't be
the only person on this ship

213
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:20,903
who hated Comic Book Guy.

214
00:09:20,904 --> 00:09:22,474
So, I guess we'll just
have to question

215
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:24,779
every passenger on the manifest.

216
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,083
Why don't we start with
fans of the Taika-verse?

217
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:31,057
Whoops, that's everyone.
[laughs]

218
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:32,059
Let's go.

219
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,899
I hate Comic Book Guy
and I hated that doll

220
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,537
because it originally
belonged to me.

221
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:39,074
[gasps]

222
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:42,513
[gasps]

223
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,222
Oh. Oh. Ooh.

224
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:48,826
Oh, oh. Oh. Ooh! Ooh.

225
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:51,899
Hi. Excuse me,
but I will take this, uh,

226
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,972
non-priceless,
completely valueless garbage

227
00:09:55,073 --> 00:09:59,114
- off of your hands for, uh, $11.
- Huh?

228
00:09:59,214 --> 00:10:02,620
But, Dad, I think it might
be worth a lot more.

229
00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:04,693
Who cares, Milhouse?

230
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:07,831
This is two $5 footlongs
and a weird cookie.

231
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:12,173
Hey, Luann, anniversary dinner
is back on, baby.

232
00:10:13,811 --> 00:10:15,681
I didn't destroy
that action figure,

233
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,651
but I sure had a motive.

234
00:10:17,652 --> 00:10:19,889
A clear motive.

235
00:10:20,658 --> 00:10:22,929
I don't know why
you're interrogating me.

236
00:10:23,062 --> 00:10:26,268
I have no bone to grind with
that Comic Book chap.

237
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,675
Really?
Even after Comic Book Guy

238
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:31,278
led an online troll army

239
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:34,618
to demand you be fired
and replaced in this?

240
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:37,924
[announcer] <i>From the producers

241
00:10:37,925 --> 00:10:40,163

[wheezing laugh]

247
00:10:56,595 --> 00:10:58,398
Curse that funny-book fiend.

248
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,637
He mobilized both
the Hanna-Barbarians

249
00:11:00,738 --> 00:11:02,474
and the Wack-olytes against me

250
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:05,179
in a devastating
online petition.

251
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,115
[Lisa gasps]

252
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:08,754
[rumbling]

253
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:10,123
First of all,
that looks so good,

254
00:11:10,223 --> 00:11:12,327
I'm surprised
I didn't direct it.

255
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,230
Did I? October was crazy.

256
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:17,302
But Mel, would your
bone-trembling anger

257
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:18,404
lead you to destroy

258
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:21,378
Comic Book Guy's
most prized possession?

259
00:11:21,478 --> 00:11:23,616
It would! But it didn't.

260
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,853
But it could! And if I did,

261
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:28,492
I would lie about it to you now!

262
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:31,398
But I'm not. But I would!

263
00:11:34,038 --> 00:11:36,042
Why are you
wasting your time with me?

264
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:38,445
I love my greasy snowman husband

265
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:41,317
and his tragic blooper
of an action figure.

266
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:44,524
We have security footage
that says differently.

267
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:53,910
It's true, I hated that
injection-molded monstrosity.

268
00:11:54,044 --> 00:11:56,047
When I first met Comic Book Guy,

269
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,518
I was his priceless collectible.

270
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,955
But now, when we make love,

271
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:02,928
my husband calls out
the doll's serial number.

272
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:07,137
I just want back my sweet
Comic Book gaijin.

273
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,174
[sobs]

274
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:15,386
So many passengers could have
committed doll-icide.

275
00:12:15,387 --> 00:12:16,823
Hmm.

276
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:18,325
Poor Bart. Ah, but geez,

277
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:21,899
look at the mess
he left in our cabin.

278
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:23,837
[gasps]

279
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:27,712
Oh, dear God.

280
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:29,214
I didn't think Bart did it

281
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,317
but then I found
this radioactive head

282
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:34,089
from the decapitated doll
in Bart's stuff.

283
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,527
He looked me right in the eyes

284
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:38,532
and said he didn't do it.

285
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,568
I can never trust him again.

286
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:42,106
- [cries]
- Oh, sweetie,

287
00:12:42,107 --> 00:12:45,379
you've just learned
one of life's hardest lessons.

288
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,018
Sometimes, no matter
how much you love someone,

289
00:12:48,118 --> 00:12:50,588
they're just
going to let you down.

290
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:52,226
For your mother, it's me.

291
00:12:52,227 --> 00:12:54,497
Just try to get
some sleep, honey.

292
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:58,706
Bart will still be
horribly guilty in the morning.

293
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:02,749
[sighs]

294
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:04,284
- [knock on door]
- Hmm?

295
00:13:06,488 --> 00:13:08,090
Rainer Wolfcastle?

296
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:09,593
There is something
I must tell you

297
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:13,469
about the night of the fanquet
and subsequent toy murder.

298
00:13:13,602 --> 00:13:15,006
When everything went dark,

299
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,277
I was wearing
my night-vision goggles,

300
00:13:17,377 --> 00:13:19,981
from my upcoming film
<i>The Night-Vision Goggler.</i>

301
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:21,652
[gasps] Did you see who did it?

302
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:24,825
Patience, Fr äulein.
I did see the culprit,

303
00:13:24,826 --> 00:13:28,734
and I am about to tell you
who he or she is.

304
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:31,739
Watch as the words
emerge from my mouth.

305
00:13:31,873 --> 00:13:35,479
The doll murderer
is <i>nein</i> other than...

306
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,682
Ouch.

307
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:40,589
I will be passing out now
and all of these things.

308
00:13:40,724 --> 00:13:42,226
[groans]

309
00:13:42,227 --> 00:13:43,362
[gasps]

310
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:53,750
[groans] Damn it.

311
00:13:56,857 --> 00:13:58,091
Ugh.

312
00:14:01,364 --> 00:14:04,204
Lisa. Are you also up
dusting for prints?

313
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:06,041
That's what I call
eating leftover food

314
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:08,078
off people's room-service trays.

315
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,518
I don't care!

316
00:14:12,454 --> 00:14:15,092
If one more
horrible thing happens,

317
00:14:15,192 --> 00:14:16,963
I'm going to lose it.

318
00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:18,298
[Kumiko screams]

319
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:22,808
My sweet Comic Book Guy is gone.

320
00:14:22,908 --> 00:14:25,512
Of course he is.

321
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:26,681
I mean...

322
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:28,485
[shouts]

323
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:34,715
Bart's in jail,
our one credible witness

324
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:35,883
just got sucker-shielded,

325
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:37,253
Comic Book Guy is missing,

326
00:14:37,353 --> 00:14:39,391
and we're still no closer
to solving the case.

327
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:41,193
So many twists and turns.

328
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:42,931
What kind of
murder mystery is this?

329
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:45,603
Stop talking, Taika Waititi.

330
00:14:45,736 --> 00:14:46,805
That's it.

331
00:14:46,806 --> 00:14:48,441
I know who murdered the toy.

332
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:50,145
But I just need one thing:

333
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,786
An audience to watch me
milk the big reveal.

334
00:14:53,887 --> 00:14:56,624
The murder of Comic Book Guy's
action figure

335
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:00,166
was committed
by Comic Book Guy himself.

336
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,570
Based on a hunch,
I wrote to Lloyd's of London,

337
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,776
and I got this response
from Lloyd himself. Good guy.

338
00:15:05,777 --> 00:15:08,883
Comic Book Guy had the doll
appraised and insured

339
00:15:08,983 --> 00:15:11,855
for 935,000 British pounds.

340
00:15:11,856 --> 00:15:13,292
[all exclaiming]

341
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:14,660
So, he turned off the lights

342
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:17,233
and murdered
the plastic action man himself

343
00:15:17,234 --> 00:15:18,668
for the insurance money.

344
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,738
But then he knew
that we were onto him,

345
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:22,844
or, let's face it,
I was onto him.

346
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:24,514
So, he took flight
in the dead of night,

347
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:27,252
but not before planting
the doll's head in Bart's cabin,

348
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:29,157
and knocking out
the one witness to the crime,

349
00:15:29,257 --> 00:15:31,995
washed-up action star
Rainier Wolfcastle.

350
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:33,598

375
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:30,480
<i>received some bad news</i>

According to this website,

385
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,003
that second doll was sold

386
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:00,738

with a "U."

388

Now, who on this boat do we know
comes from New Zealand?

389

Well, that's
a very clever theory.

390
00:17:10,626 --> 00:17:12,230
But if it's a crime
to be from New Zealand,

391
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,668
you'd have to arrest both guys
from Flight of the Conchords.

Fred and Jimothy?

You might be right,

394
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:23,217

that incapacitated

396
