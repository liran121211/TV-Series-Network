Art lovers of springfield,
good news.

00:00:08,293 --> 00:00:10,969
The art museum
is closed forever!

4
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:15,640
Instead, our entire collection
will be digitized

5
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:18,226
And sold for a fortune
on the blockchain

6
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:22,189
As non-fungible tokens, or nfts.

7
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:24,900

00:01:19,123 --> 00:01:21,039
For bart? Hmm.

26
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:23,959
Imagine what we'd get for lisa.

27
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:27,254
He is the first nft
of an actual person.

28
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:28,338
I don't care.

29
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,549
We've got to find a way
to get him back.

30
00:01:30,551 --> 00:01:34,845
to do that, you, yourself
must enter the blockchain.

I thought you were
just celebrity shills.

Ugh, we would never

You ruined "cowbell."

Once you're inside, find bart

47
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:14,968
And use it to get
both of you out.

48
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,436
Huh, so this is the blockchain.

For a digital incarnation of an
abstract mathematical concept,

00:02:43,624 --> 00:02:45,540
It could use a good dusting.

The dwelling place of nfts
with no value.

58

Which is 99% of all nfts
ever created.

59

Huh, I guess being
the second-ever human nft

60
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,306

00:03:01,308 --> 00:03:03,183
Where do they keep my son?

at the very front of the train

63
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:07,103
Where you can never go.

64

The cuddle kittens.

70
00:03:32,756 --> 00:03:34,839
Because you killed another nft.

71
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,800
What you call
mindless slaughter,

72
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:38,802
Crypto-bros call "disruption,"

73
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:40,470
And then pour cash into it.

74
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:42,180
So, to rescue bart,

75
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:44,349
I need to kill
a bunch of you guys.

76
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:51,773
Ooh.

77
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:53,817
Well, I guess I got to do this.

78
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:59,239
Sorry! Nothing personal!

79
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,121
Hope... You... Can't...
Feel... Pain.

80
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:34,107
mom's price is skyrocketing!

81

Look at the fomo!

89
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:12,437

I made it.

91
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:18,109
Whoa, mom, what's the rush?

92
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:20,779
Grab yourself a jaded ape
and take a load off.

93
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:23,573
You never like my friends.

94
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:25,658
Mom's almost got bart out.

95
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,578
Don't let your son become
a worthless human again.

96
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,121
Sell him to me

97
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:32,582
-For $100 million.
-Hmm!

98
00:05:32,584 --> 00:05:35,377
No, dad!
If you sell bart to mr. Burns,

99
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:38,254
He'll be trapped
on the blockchain forever.

100
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:40,423
But this is my chance
not to miss out,

101
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:42,342
After I've missed out
on everything.

102
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:44,636
The housing bubble,
the first tech bubble,

103
00:05:44,638 --> 00:05:47,305
The second tech bubble,
the current tech bubble.

104
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:49,557
Just one time,
I want to be the guy

105
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:52,102
That gives all his money
to bernie madoff!

106
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:55,230
Mom, get out of there!
Dad's gonna crack!

107
00:06:08,078 --> 00:06:09,369
He did it.

108
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:11,037
I can't believe he did it.

109
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,625
-We made it.
-Where's homer?

110
00:06:15,627 --> 00:06:17,877
I want to tell him the inside
of his phone smells.

111
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,004
He-he sold himself.

112
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:22,006
He was so afraid of missing out,

113
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:24,467
He tokened his own life.

114
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:26,803
Woo-hoo!

115
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:29,764

00:09:51,718 --> 00:09:53,551
Turning on the coffee maker.

183
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:56,888
Even I can't get inside
a mind this deranged.

184
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,016
There's only one person who can.

185
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:04,395
Little lisa simpson.

186
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:06,064
You really made something
of yourself

187
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:08,191
After I made mincemeat
of your brother.

188
00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:09,609
Come to thank me?

189
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:11,569
-No.
-Rude.

190
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:13,571
I don't have time
for your games, bob.

191
00:10:13,573 --> 00:10:14,614
I'm working on a--

192
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:15,698
Yes, a case so confounding

193
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,575
You're actually willing
to seek my help.

194
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:20,870
The rube goldberg sherri
is actually quite impressive.

195
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:22,163
Hat tip, psychopath.

196
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:24,248
What about
the identical messages?

197
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,034
How can they all be "the first"?

198
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:28,503
Really, professor simpson,

199
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:31,172
Am I meant to spoon-feed you
all the answers?

200
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:34,008
Speak in riddles or drop a clue
in a clever anagram

201
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,844
Hidden in something
I've just said right now.

202
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:38,304
This is a waste of time.

203
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:40,098
Perhaps a limerick will help.

204
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,016
There once was a shiny machete,

205
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:44,268
That turned poor bart's head
to spaghetti.

206
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,771
You're gonna die
in that cell, bob.

207
00:10:46,773 --> 00:10:48,606
And when that happens,

208
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:50,066
Wherever I am,

209
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:52,068
I'll be dancing.

210
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,203
Can you think of anyone who
would've wanted to hurt sherri?

211
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:05,081
No, everybody loved
my big sister.

212
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,541
Big sister?

213
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:07,875
You guys were twins.

214
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:10,461
Yes, but sherri was born first.

215
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,799
Probably makes sense for you
to be my husband now, huh?

216
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:16,259
Sherri is the first.

217
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:19,595
Rod flanders, dermott spuckler,
all firstborns,

218
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:21,097
That's the pattern.

219
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:22,890
And bob said something
about an anagram

220
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:24,726
Taking us to the killer's lair.

221
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:27,603
that's it.

222
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:40,742
Stay here.

223
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,415
Hey, meat hooks, hook meat much?

224
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:49,125
Ha-ha--

225
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:53,880
Nelson?

226
00:11:53,882 --> 00:11:56,174
Nelson, where are you?

227
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:09,103
The killer's lair looks
just like my old bedroom.

228
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:11,189
But how? Ooh.

229
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:13,524
Maybe the killer's
on the security footage.

230
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:18,863
No! It can't be!

231
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:21,157
freeze!

232
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,283
wha...?

233
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:23,868
I can't be the killer!

234
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,412
I turned my trauma into healing!

235
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:28,039
Oprah said so!

236
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:32,084
I'm sorry for the imbroglio,
but if the chef de cuisine

237
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:34,754
Insists on calling it
taco tuesdays,

238
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:36,756
He can't very well serve flautas

239
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:38,758
And expect us not
to make a fuss.

240
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:43,137
Hello, bob.

241
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,515
H-how did you get in here?

242
00:12:45,517 --> 00:12:47,850
Well, I knew if I killed
enough people

243
00:12:47,852 --> 00:12:50,102
In the most gruesome
possible ways,

244
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:52,271
They'd send me to your prison.

245
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:54,232
But to get into your cell?

246
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:56,275
I had a little help.

247
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:01,447
Lisa the killer.

248
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:03,324
I never thought
you had it in you.

249
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:06,285
The lisa you knew didn't.

250
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:08,579
But I'm another story.

251
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:10,081
Oh, really?

252
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,958
Split personalities?

253
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,292
Trope alert!

254
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:15,753
Call the first thought police.

255
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:17,839
Professor lisa had no idea

256
00:13:17,841 --> 00:13:19,674
<i> She was my accomplice.</i>

257
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:24,846
But she's gone now.

258
00:13:24,848 --> 00:13:26,639
She was my last victim.

259
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:29,642
Or, rather, second to last.

260
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:31,769
The penultimate.

No eating in the turbine room.

267
00:13:57,755 --> 00:13:59,130
Since when?

268
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:04,051
Pfft. The nanny state
wins again.

269
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:06,137
No tanning in the reactor core,

270
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:08,389
No texting while driving
and eating ribs.

271
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:10,933
Can't even trim your hedges
with a machine gun.

272
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:12,602
When did everyone get so scared?

273
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:16,480
The world would be fine if
people just used common sense.

274
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:17,648
Like me.

275
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,108
Ah! Jailbreak!

276
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,749
Woman. Woman.

277
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:42,006
Homer, one. Nanny state, zero.

278
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:51,307
Stupid radioactive garbage donut

279
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:54,268
Mutating my dna while I sleep.

280
00:14:56,439 --> 00:15:00,316
Hey, who stole
my flanders's newspaper?

281
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:01,567
Sorry about that, homer-ino,

282
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:04,654
But I-I whited out the crossword
after I did it,

283
00:15:04,656 --> 00:15:06,072
So you could enjoy it, too.

284
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:10,201
ah.

285
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:12,912
Better from the chimney
than the furnace, am I right?

286
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:19,168
So, you see, there's nothing
in the bible that says

287
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:23,506
A pastor and his wife
can't take separate vacations.

288
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,055
Daddy, are you being tickled
by the holy spirit?

289
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:43,567
I've been neighborino'd
into home-diddly-omer.

290
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:47,571
and why am I in church
when football is on?

291
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:00,584
Kiss my ass, church-os.

292
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:05,214
I'm fat, I'm bald, and
I've never felt sexier, baby.

293
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:08,300
Why, you little...

294
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:09,844
Woo-hoo!

295
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:20,021
<i> a mysterious affliction</i>
<i>has descended upon springfield.</i>

296
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:23,107
<i> Citizens of every age,</i>
<i> race and catchphrase</i>

297
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:27,403
<i> Are mysteriously transforming</i>
<i> into bald, pear-shaped doofi.</i>

298
00:16:29,032 --> 00:16:32,950
donut stu has diabetes type 2.

299
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:38,372
News is stupid.

300
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:39,999
Somebody put on wrestling.

301
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:41,876
Do all these burping baldos

302
00:16:41,878 --> 00:16:44,045
Remind you of anyone?

303
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:46,338
I'd know that
butt scratch anywhere.

304
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,382
Everyone's turning into dad.

305
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:07,818
Uh, children, your father's
less than<i> stellar</i> genetic code

306
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,946
Is spreading through
burp-borne transmission.

307
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,740
If we're going
to cure this virus,

308
00:17:12,742 --> 00:17:14,116
We need his dna.

309
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:16,994
You three are the only ones
impervious to the virus.

310
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:19,330
You have got to find him.

311
00:17:19,332 --> 00:17:21,540
Hmm. It is 11:30 in the morning.

312
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:26,921
-Beer, moe.
-Beer, moe.

313
00:17:26,923 --> 00:17:28,214
A-beer, a-moe.

314
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:29,632
Have you seen our dad?

315
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:32,635
No, just these hundreds
of silly versions of him,

316
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:35,012
Which is the greatest thing
that has ever happened to me.

317
00:17:35,014 --> 00:17:36,722
I mean,
I'm printing money over here.

318
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:40,601
Coming right up,
santa's little homer.

319
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:43,854
Real dad wasn't at the
bowling alley, the candy store,

320
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:46,732
Or mocking the hippos
at the zoo.

321
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,025
Wait.

322
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:49,735
Dad ate a bucket
of this chicken last night.

323
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:52,738
When that happens, where does he
always spend the next day?

324
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,117
I'll be out in a minute.

325
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,868
Um, is this really the most

326
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,620
Convenient bathroom
for your father?

327
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:01,872
It's the closest one
mom will let him use.

328
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:05,042
Dad, we need you
to save the world.

329
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:05,876
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

330
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,086
Can you believe some idiot

331
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:10,005
Left this perfectly good
back scratcher in there?

332
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:12,550
Look, it goes all...

333
00:18:12,552 --> 00:18:14,635
The way... Down.

334
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:17,429
What?

335
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:21,517
Now, if you'll just board
the frink-ama-copter--

336
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:23,727
We're not calling it that.

337
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:26,939
And then we'll pop your dna
in to the frink-tabulizer--

338
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:28,724
We're not calling it that.

339
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,529
And everything will go back
to the way it was.

340
00:18:33,531 --> 00:18:36,073
Wait. Hold on.
Why would I want that?

341
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:37,992
Finally, everyone thinks
the way I do.

342
00:18:37,994 --> 00:18:41,036
Nobody's making up stupid rules
about bicycle helmets

343
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:42,538
Or where you can smoke cigars.

344
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,373
You want to drive
without a seatbelt?

345
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,041
Facetime while jaywalking?

346
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,501
Enjoy a sugary soda?

347
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:50,129
Go ahead!
You're not hurting anyone!

348
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:51,755
It's a utopia.

349
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,507
No, a me-topia!

350
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:57,261
Yes, well, you don't really want
everyone to be like you.

351
00:18:57,263 --> 00:19:00,014
Earth-shattering reveal!

352
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,103
When did insurance commercials
get so funny?

353
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:08,397
marge!

354
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:10,399
Cooperating with us
is the only way

355
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:12,985
To get your wife back to normal.

356
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:16,405
You've never looked
more beautiful.

357
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:20,910
Scooch over, gorgeous.

358
00:19:20,912 --> 00:19:22,286
When we get home,

359
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:24,580
Let's you and I bump muzzles.

360
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:28,209
Please. Please! If we don't have
some competent people left

361
00:19:28,211 --> 00:19:30,794
To run things,
society will collapse!

362
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:32,338
Coders to run the internet

363
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,632
That feeds you
the latest misinformation.

364
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:37,927
Pilots to fly the planes
you need to be restrained on.

365
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:40,054
I mean,
a world without experts--

366
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:42,139
Does beaker ever shut up?

367
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:44,016
good one, me-marge.

368
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:45,517
Mm, well,
you leave me no choice.

369
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,686
I'm calling in
a nuclear air strike

370
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:51,065
To obliterate all
the homerized springfielders,

371
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,608
Including, very sadly,

372
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,818
The touring company
of<i> kinky boots.</i>

373
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,071
Obliterating in three, two--

374
00:19:57,073 --> 00:19:58,405
Hey, you know what you need?

375
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:01,492
A nice, relaxing scratch
on the back.

376
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:05,996
No! No! Oh, a lifetime
of study and education

377
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:07,164
