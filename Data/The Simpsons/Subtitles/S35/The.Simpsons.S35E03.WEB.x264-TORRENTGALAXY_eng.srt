Hey, I have friends
in this neighborhood.

16
00:01:45,107 --> 00:01:47,691
There's the guy whose lawn
I used as a shortcut,

17

The guy whose mailbox
crashed into our car,

Why you take so much of it?

Look, the people who know us

But these new people

In north springfield.
Hey, drop by anytime.

45
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:51,046

And dick van dyke.

Well, my friend, perhaps I could

48
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:55,258
Set you up with something.

49
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,845
Those cars are expensive,
and we're still paying off

Look, most people don't buy.
I don't care.

Just pop in for a look,
stretch out,

53
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:07,020
Chug a smartwater

56
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:12,025
Of course.

57
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:14,236
Whoa-ho, that's quite a grip.

58
00:03:14,238 --> 00:03:17,489
See, marge? Strangling the boy
has paid off.

59
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:19,574
Just kidding.
I don't do that anymore.

60
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:20,909
Times have changed.

61
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:22,369
Hey, do you play pickleball?

62
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:25,205
Is that the game like tennis
but you don't have to run?

63
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:26,873
Well, you do have
to move a little.

64
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,000
-Then no.
-Aw, that's too bad,

00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:41,012
And while the boys are
hanging out, marge,

69
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:42,138
How about a massage?

70
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,974
Sure, but I have to warn you,

the face holes, my treat.

Listen, pal, if you're moving
into this neighborhood,

75
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,111
There is one thing I've got
to warn you about.

76
00:03:56,113 --> 00:03:57,904
Howdily-doodily.
I brought bibles

77

It will get better.

83
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:11,209
And when you're older,
get rich

84
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:13,003
And wedgie their egos.

85
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:22,387

You can't even squish a bug.

All right, I started to suspect

When you tried to eat
the pickleball, homer.

127
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:09,494
Nothing should be named food

132
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:19,003

133
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:21,381
At least I pretend to
because I think it's cool.

134
00:06:21,383 --> 00:06:23,508
So why are you
interested in me?

135
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,386
Is it to sell me a car
I can't afford?

136
00:06:26,388 --> 00:06:28,221
No, I'm not like that, homer.

137
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:30,306
These cars,
they sell themselves.

138
00:06:30,308 --> 00:06:32,016
I just want to be your friend.

00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:33,017

146
00:06:44,823 --> 00:06:46,489
I was born ready.

147
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,450
Then I lost interest
for a long time.

148
00:06:48,452 --> 00:06:49,826
But I'm ready now.

149
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:50,910
D'oh!

00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,999
Now, no worries.

151
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:59,043
Each lambuggini comes with a tub
of fatso grease.

152
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:02,338
Just got to apply it.

153
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,340
Ah.

154
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:09,095
Wow. Wow!

155
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:10,555
Well, don't look now, homer,

156
00:07:10,557 --> 00:07:13,641
But you just became
a lambo man.

157
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:15,894
Come on, a loser like me? Never.

158
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:17,479
Hey, now, would I give a loser

159
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:19,898
A bottle of genuine
lambuggini wine?

160
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,107
I would not.

161
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:23,526
Wine from a car? Whoa.

162
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:25,612
Don't you be getting
no fancy ideas, homer.

163
00:07:25,614 --> 00:07:28,907
You want to suckle booze,
you come to mama moe.

164
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,158
Uh, the car can sense that

165
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,202
You're having
an unpleasant thought.

166
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:34,704
Oh, no, not fresh air!

167
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,416
Why are you being so nice to me?

168
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:40,752
Well, I like you, homer.
You live next door,

169
00:07:40,754 --> 00:07:42,045
And we love our house.

170
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:43,713
Just needs a few tweaks.

171
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:45,340
Tweaks, tweaks, tweaks,
tweaks, tweaks.

172
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:48,718
And, uh, I really want us
to be friends.

173
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,304
Well, I want to believe you.

174
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:52,889
All right, I understand.
You're not sure.

175
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:57,310
But there is another guy
who does want to be my buddy.

176
00:07:57,312 --> 00:07:59,604
another offer?
Is it serious?

177
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:01,898
Oh, yeah. He's been circling
for a while.

178
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,566
I said I'd get back to him
by 5:00.

179
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:05,902
Okay, okay, friends it is.
I'll sign anything.

180
00:08:05,904 --> 00:08:08,238

00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:02,294
What do we do now?

357
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,005
What neighbors have done
during construction

358
00:16:04,007 --> 00:16:06,132
Since the time of the pharaohs:

359
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:07,925
Sit and mutter.

360
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:14,140
no good, two-bit
charming son of a gun...

361
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:16,091
Muttering, eh?
Can I join you?

362
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:17,977
I brought my muttering chair.

363
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:21,397
-No.
-You stupid, ungrateful...

364
00:16:35,872 --> 00:16:36,954
Hubert wong.

365
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:39,665
Lisa simpson.
It's on.

366
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,042
Nerdo y nerdo.

367
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:43,335
It's nerdo<i> a</i> nerdo.

368
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:45,254
Only a nerdo would know that.

369
00:16:45,256 --> 00:16:48,466
A<i> nerda!</i>
And it is on.

370
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:55,681
Why'd you stop?

371
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:58,225
I just realized this
extracurricular activity

372
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:00,269
Would look bad
on a college application.

373
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:03,022
Wha...? Are you also
thinking détente?

374
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:05,274
I was actually thinking
"entente."

375
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:07,902
Whoa, moving a little
fast there, lisa.

376
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:11,363
Nerds. What have they ever
contributed to society?

377
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:14,450
Siri, tell me one thing
that nerds have ever done.

390
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:38,891
For an up-and-down?

391

Get away from me.

392
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,359

We can't stop them?
We can't sell?

394

And god forbid
we burn their house down.

395
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:55,116
Just putting that out there.

396
00:17:55,118 --> 00:17:57,535
-We could never do that.
-No.

397
00:17:58,913 --> 00:18:01,747
Although fires are easy
to blame on grampa.

398
00:18:03,543 --> 00:18:04,708
Just putting that out there.

399
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,294
You put everything out there
but the trash.

400
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,213
Maybe you could do the trash.

401
00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:11,006
-Just putting--
-don't say it.

402
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,716
We have an answer.

403
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:14,835
Wait, you guys are friends now?

404
00:18:14,837 --> 00:18:16,887
I've learned everything there is
to learn about lisa.

405
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:19,473
It made me realize if someone
doesn't help her family,

406
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:21,684
And soon, she's gonna
go off the rails

407
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:23,102
In a very bad way.

408
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:25,938
And I've learned that hubert
is desperate for approval,

409
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,190
So I can control him
with pumpkin stickers.

410
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,151
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

411
00:18:30,153 --> 00:18:32,194
Yes. I matter.

412
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,196
Anyway, when I was doxing
your daughter,

413
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:35,906
I learned a very
interesting thing

414
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:37,032
About this street.

415
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:39,034
Your home sits on the site

416
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:41,871
Where jebediah springfield
founded this town.

417
00:18:41,873 --> 00:18:45,207
Eh, we better stop here
'cause the horses are dead.

418
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:48,002
Spring, field?

419
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:50,379
We'll call it fieldspring.

420
00:18:50,381 --> 00:18:53,132
So this street is
a historical landmark.

421
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:56,302
All their renovations
are not permitted.

422
00:18:56,304 --> 00:18:57,970
Parenthetically, homer,

423
00:18:57,972 --> 00:18:59,722
You can never
fix your house again.

424
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:01,056
Win-win!

425
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:11,025
Attention. I am here
to return a car.

426
00:19:11,027 --> 00:19:13,277
Homer, buddy, I thought
we were friends.

427
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,987
I've learned that
my only true friends

428
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:17,156
Are those tragic souls at moe's.

429
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:20,159
Now go fob yourself!

430
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:23,704
Well, I guess I made
a mistake, homer.

431
00:19:23,706 --> 00:19:26,624
I thought you were a lambo man.

432
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:28,751
News flash. I was wrong.

433
00:19:28,753 --> 00:19:30,669
You know,
I've learned something.

434
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:34,215
There's no such thing
as a "lambo man,"

435
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:37,176
Just rich jerks
with stupid cars.

436
00:19:37,178 --> 00:19:38,469
Oh, my god, he's right.

437
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:41,680
This doesn't make my junk
look any bigger.

438
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:42,973
You know what? Forget it.

439
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,351
I'm gonna date somebody
my own age.

440
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:52,733
When you have love,
you don't need a fancy car.
