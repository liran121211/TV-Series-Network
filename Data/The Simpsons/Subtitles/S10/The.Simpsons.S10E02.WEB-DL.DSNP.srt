00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,297
No. I don't deserve sugar.

42
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,926
I'm halfway to my grave
and I haven't accomplished anything.

nor even an adequate man.

45
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,028
And he certainly
never accomplished anything.

Uh, President Lenny,
you have anything to say?

47
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,574
Nah.

48
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,826
All right. Fair enough.
Toss him in the hole, boys.

49
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,747
There goes a real sack of crap.

50
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,500
Indubitably, old chum.

51
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,755
Oh...

52
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,174
Marge, no matter what happens
in the future,

53
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,758
promise me you won't vote for Lenny.

54
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,802
OK, but you've accomplished a lot.

55
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,013
You've made me very happy.

56
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,307
Oh, yeah, they'll put me

58
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,476

You know how many memories I have?

60
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,356
Three... standing in line for a movie.

61
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,443
Having a key made and sitting here
talking to you.

62
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,613
Thirty-eight years and that's all I have
to show for it.

00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,031

00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,892
You can't come back later because...

71
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:49,479
ALL: Homer Simpson, welcome to your life!

72
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,605
...to your life!

73
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,611
The kids and I want to show you
all the great things you've done.

74
00:03:56,694 --> 00:04:00,198
Oh, all right. Maybe I can pinpoint
where my life went wrong.

75
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,116
Quiet, Dad, or we'll have to
throw you out of here.

76
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,454
(gasps) The pictures,
they're coming alive!

00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,666
LISA: There you are in outer space.
That's pretty impressive.

78
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:14,420

86
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,855
Well, there's certainly
no greater accomplishment

87
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,733
than fathering three beautiful children.

-Turn it off. Turn it off.
-Hang on, Dad...

92
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,453

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,058
Stupid movies.
Who invented these dumb things, anyway?

100
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,560
Was it you, Bart?

101
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,228
It was Thomas Edison, Dad.

102
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,896
I thought he invented the light bulb.

103
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,982
That, too, he also invented
the phonograph,

104
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,942
the microphone and the electric car.

105
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,527
No one man can do all that.

106
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,863
You're a liar, honey,
a dirty, rotten liar.

107
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,990
Finish her! Finish her!

108
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:27,285
It's true. I read it on a place mat
at a restaurant.

109
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,413
Really? A restaurant?

110
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,831
Well, now I don't know what to think.

111
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,334

112
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,501

115
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,426
Dad, what are you doing here?

116
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,386
Reading about this Edison character.

117
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,097
They won't let me

118
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,060
There was some... unpleasantness.
I can never go back.

119
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,772
Ooh, look at all the inventions
Edison came up with.

120
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,440

121
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,567
the storage battery...

122
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,402
even wax paper...

123
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,987

127
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,454
And these <i>Hardy Boys </i>books
are great, too.

128
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,081
This one's about smugglers.

129
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,208
-They're all about smugglers.
-No, not this one--

130
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,211
"The Smugglers of Pirate Cove."
It's about pirates.

131
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,089
Excuse me, are you a student
at this school?

132
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,425
I think it's pretty obvious that I am.

133
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,052
Go, school!

134
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,556
So... this broad stands up in the ocean

135
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,726
and this big wave knocks
her bathing suit off.

136
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,937
Oh, yeah? And then what happened?

137
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,481
Omit no detail, however small or filthy.

138
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,274
So, anyway, and this is the part

139
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,152
you'll remember
for the rest of your lives--

140
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,654
Yeah, yeah, yeah, great story, Lenny,

141
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,532
but here's one
that's even more spellbinding.

142
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:52,286
Once upon a time,
there was a man named Thomas Edison.

143
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,622
And he invented the dictating machine

144
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:58,709
and the fluoroscope,
and the repeating telegraph...

145
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,629
And he was a firm believer in Fletcherism
and he played the organ

146
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,881
and his favorite flower
was the heliotrope.

147
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,508
Oh, and his middle name was Alva

148
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,678
and he never ever,
ever wore pajamas, and--

149
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,556
OK, I think we've been polite
long enough here.

150
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,599
Lenny, what happened with the dame
in the bathing suit?

151
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,393
Huh? Oh.

152
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,477
Uh...

153
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,604
Oh, nuts. I forgot.

154
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,606
All I can think of now is Edison.

155
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,483
I can't even remember where I work.

156
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,611
Well, I remember where Edison worked.
It was Menlo park.

157
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,530
That's where he came up
with the tasimeter,

158
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,990
the ore separator and--

159
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,952
-Uh, James Watt invented the steam engine.
-That's boring.

160
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,080
You're boring everybody.
Quit boring everyone.

161
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,332
And then he worked on a machine
to communicate with the dead.

162
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,293
Some kind of scary telephone, I guess.

163
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,837
Or maybe he planned to stick his head
under the ground and yell.

164
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,215
All right, already! Everyone knows
the man accomplished a lot.

165
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,551
Maybe because he didn't spend
every waking moment

166
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,553
talking about Thomas Edison.

167
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,597
Oh, that's where you're wrong, Marge.

168
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,057
He was a shameless self-promoter.

169
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,768
Well, you're not Thomas Edison.

170
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,645
Marge, that's it!

171
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,939
That's why I haven't done
anything with my life.

172
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,067
I need to be more like Thomas Edison.

173
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,652
Whatever.

174
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,988
And I'm starting right now.

175
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:12,283
No more lousy pajamas! (grunts)

176
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,244
From this day forward, I am an inventor!

177
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,582
Do us a favor. Invent yourself
some underpants.

178
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,089
(whistling)

179
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,425
Ah.

180
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,137
Well, I quit my job just like you said to.

181
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,306
I didn't tell you to quit your job.

182
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,934
Yes, you did. I remember your exact words.

183
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,312
You said I should quit my job
and become an inventor

184
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,772
or you'd torch the house.

185
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,316
That doesn't sound like me.

186
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,985
Well, I suppose if this doesn't work out,

187
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,779
you can always go back to the plant.

188
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,406
(chuckling) Not the way I quit.

189
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,909
Whoo-hoo.

190
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,676
At my age, Edison had already invented
203 things.

191
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,929
Oh-ho, I've got a lot of work
to do to catch up to him.

192
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,014
Let's see, now...

193
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:21,310
-Inventions, inventions...
-(footsteps approaching)

194
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,149
Something electrical might be good.

195
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,111
Eh, eh, eh. Let me handle
the creative end of this, Marge.

196
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,613
You don't understand
how the creative mind works

197
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,490
-like I do.
-Oh?

198
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,661
You look at this table
and what do you see? Just a table.

199
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,830
Now, a creative person like me
looks at this table

200
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,709
and sees all kinds of creative things.
But no tables.

201
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,210
Homer, that's not a table.

202
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,420
That's our dryer.

203
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,796
Aahh! My files!

204
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,174
Hmm.

205
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,262
This isn't working.

206
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,389
I've got to try a different approach.

207
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,099
Hmm...

208
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,351
Hm? Hmm...

209
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,686
Hmmm?

210
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,608
(grunts)

211
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,151
(gasps)

212
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,569
(groans)

213
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,532
(coughing)

214
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,868
(contented sigh)

215
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,997
You started smoking, Dad?

216
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,584
Yes. Thomas Edison smoked
several cigars a day.

217
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,252
-Yeah, he invented stuff, too.
-Shut up.

218
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,131
Whoa...

219
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,594
As long as you're here annoying me,
let's have a brainstorming session.

220
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,887
Now, here's how it works...

221
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,973
Lisa, you say one thing,
then, Bart, you say another.

222
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,517
Just toss out things,
and I'll use my inventive mind

223
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,103
to combine them into a brilliant,
original idea.

224
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,105
OK. Um...

225
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,565
Automatic...

226
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,734
-Butt.
-OK.

227
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,529
-Fluorescent...
-Booger.

228
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,323
Uh-hmm.

229
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,242
Wait a minute. These aren't exciting
new products.

230
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,453
You're not even trying. OK, that's it.

231
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,705
Both of you go to your rooms
and spank yourselves.

232
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,335
Lazy father.

233
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,462
Can't even spank his own kids.

234
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,757
Homer, you can't punish the children

235
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,093
just because you can't come up
with an idea.

236
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,720
I don't see why not.
They're my kids, I own 'em.

237
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,805
(groans)

238
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,391
OK, we own 'em.

239
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,433
Hmm.

240
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,229
I brought you a tuna sandwich.
They say it's brain food.

241
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,481
I guess because there's so much
dolphin in it

242
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,525
and you know how smart they are.

243
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,360
(groaning) It's no use.

244
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,655
I can't work like this, cut off
from the scientific community.

245
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,784
You stay here and guard my sandwich.

246
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:47,248
And these should give you the grounding
you'll need in thermodynamics...

247
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,999
Hyper-mathematics...

248
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:53,045
And, of course, microcalifragilistics.
Moodavit.

249
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:57,299
Look, I just want to know
how to invent things. Tell me.

250
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,470
Well, all you have to do
is think of things that people need

251
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,264
but which don't exist yet.

252
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,890
You mean, like an electric blanket mobile?

253
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,685
Uh, oh, well, possibly.

254
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,271
Or you could take something
that already exists

255
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,481
and find a new use for it, like...

256
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,525
Hamburger earmuffs!

257
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:18,362
Eh, uh, well, I suppose
that would qualify.

258
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,947
Thanks! Sucker.

259
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,617
What... all right,
just stay calm, Frinkie.

260
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,745
These babies will be in the stores

261
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:30,624
while he's still grappling
with the pickle matrix. Gyvinblayvin!

262
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,344
(explosion)

263
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,517
(explosion)

264
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,739
OK... I have here
the four greatest inventions

265
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,825
in the history of mankind.

266
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,622
First, my all-purpose electric hammer...

267
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,874
for all your pounding needs.

268
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,129
Ow! (muttering)

269
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,840
-Hey, hey, OK. Look out.
-(cat screeching)

270
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,300
(crashing)

271
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,180
Probably needs to be more powerful.

272
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,140
I will buy ten of those right now.

273
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,435
Now, here's my "everything's OK" alarm.

274
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:36,315
-(piercing squawk)
-This will sound every three seconds

275
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,235
unless something isn't OK!

276
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,904
Turn it off, Homer!

277
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,782
It can't be turned off!

278
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,784
(alarm wheezing)

279
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,912
But it, uh, does break easily.

280
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,122
Now, this next one's for the ladies.

281
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,709
How many times have you gals been late
for a high-powered business meeting

282
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,712
only to realize you're not wearing makeup?

283
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,840
That's every woman's nightmare.

284
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,676
That's why I invented
this revolutionary makeup gun.

285
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,471
It's for the woman who only has
four-fifths of a second to get ready.

286
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,765
Close your eyes, Marge.

287
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,561
And now you're ready
for a night on the town.

288
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,979
(gasps)

289
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:19,525
-Homer, you've got it set on "whore".
-Ohh. OK.

290
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,653
This time...
Try to keep your nostrils closed.

291
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,823
Oh, look what you did.

292
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,117
Now I have to go get my cold cream gun.

293
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,786
Dad, women won't like
being shot in the face.

294
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,913
Women will like what I tell them to like.

295
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,582
Now, here's something for everyone.

296
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,376
In the olden times,
if you were watching TV

297
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:41,255
and nature called, you'd have to get up
and walk to the bathroom.

298
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,008
It was the hardest thing
in the world to do.

299
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:48,220
But now, with the lazy man
reclining toilet chair,

300
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,098
you can just lean back and let 'er rip.

301
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,310
You expect people to go to the bathroom
in their living rooms?

302
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,980
Sure. Believe me, every man in America
will want to have one.

303
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,441
(flushing)

304
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,567
Gangway. Gotta poop.

305
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,735
No, Bart.

306
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:07,031
-Homer, all these inventions, they're...
-Yes?

307
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,159
-(groans) They're not very...
-Yes? Yes? Yes?

308
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,161
-They're terrible.
-What?

309
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,873
I'm not saying you're a bad inventor.

310
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:20,252
I'm just saying these particular
inventions are awful.

311
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,047
And no one in their right mind
would buy them.

312
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,132
Or accept them as gifts.

313
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,259
But this is the best I could do.

314
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,638
I guess I'm no better
at being Thomas Edison

315
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,681
than I was at being Homer Simpson.

316
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,477
Oh, dear.

317
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,812
I hope I wasn't too rough on him.

318
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,606
Somebody had to tell him, mom.

319
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,858
In the long run, it's much kinder to--

320
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,318
(Bart clearing throat)

321
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,945
Do you mind?

322
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:53,160
All week, my lifelong dream
was to be the next Thomas Edison.

323
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,662
But now it's over.

324
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,498
I guess I'll just give up
my hopes and dreams

325
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,542
and settle for being
a decent husband and father.

326
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,212
-Uh...
-(all yelling)

327
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,588
Huh?

328
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,216
What happened? You didn't fall.

329
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:11,512
Oh, that... I stuck a couple extra legs
on there 'cause I kept tipping over

330
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,180
when I was trying to invent stuff.

331
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,684
They're on hinges.
That's really ingenious, Dad.

332
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,727
It could save lives.

333
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,521
Really? You think it's a good idea?

334
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,065
Oh, yeah. Safety sells,
especially to lame-o's.

335
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,150
-I'd buy one.
-Me, too.

336
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,986
(all cooing)

337
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,154
I did it! I'm going to be rich!

338
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,000
(humming)

339
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,669
Look, Mr. Edison, I did it!

340
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,837
I'm an inventor!

341
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,422
And I owe it all to you.

342
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,675
See? It's just a regular chair.

343
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,594
But I attached a couple
of extra legs to the back.

344
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,138
Kind of like the ones
on the back of your...

345
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,766
Aw, damn it!

346
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,060
Hey, Dad. Heard you swearing.

347
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,021
Mind if I join in? Crap. Boobs. Crap.

348
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,565
I thought I had a great idea

349
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,734
but I must have seen it on this poster.

350
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,739
If Edison thought of that chair,
how come it's not on this chart?

351
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:15,701
It's not? Maybe he never told
anyone about it!

352
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,912
That chair might be the only one he made!

353
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:19,997
So?

354
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,542
So... We've got to go to the Edison museum

355
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,252
and smash it.

356
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,588
Then I'll be an inventor!

357
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,381
But I thought you loved Edison.

358
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,841
Aw, the hell with him.

359
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,218
Yeah! Hell, damn, fart!

360
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,888
(tires screeching)

361
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,015
Taking Bart across state lines. Back soon.

362
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,893
I took your wallet.

363
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,979
Oh, I just mopped that driveway.

364
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,902
Man, I can't wait to smash that chair.

365
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,906
(chuckling) Oh, son,
you're young and headstrong.

366
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,949
Just like Thomas Edison, Jr.

367
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,495
You know, he started a mushroom farm
and an auto parts company.

368
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,372
And he sold his good name
to a quack medicine company.

369
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,625
Oh! And later, he raised turkeys.

370
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,168
That was on his turkey farm.

371
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,586
(snoring)

372
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,759
Hmm.

373
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,096
Hmm...

374
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,307
Mmm. Mmm.

375
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,226
(muttering, gasps)

376
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,770
-Stop, Homer...
-(Homer gasps)

377
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:29,525
By smashing my chair,
you're only hurting yourself.

378
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,984
(grunts)

379
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,571
(yelping, grunts)

380
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,409
I'll get you, you fat lunatic!

381
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,869
(tires squealing)

382
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,037
Uh-oh.

383
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,165
Ooh...

384
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,715
(both panting)

385
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,260
All right, the museum's still open.

386
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,637
Why don't you like Edison that much?

387
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,721
(grunts)

388
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,642
Hey, folks, do you like riddles?

389
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,060
(all answering affirmatively)

390
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,979
Well, OK then.

391
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:11,316
How many geniuses does it take
to invent a light bulb?

392
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,445
Just one... Thomas Edison.

393
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,116
(cheering, laughing)

394
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,200
That's very good.

395
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,077
And that's true, too.
It's funny and true.

396
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:27,374
Now, behind that door
is Edison's actual preserved brain.

397
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,209
(all gasping)

398
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:33,046
Ordinarily, folks,
tour groups are not allowed to see it.

399
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,716
And, of course,
today will be no exception.

400
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,092
(all groaning)

401
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,719
Now, no tour would be complete

402
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,638
without a visit to Edison's
boyhood gift shop.

403
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,931
(indistinct chatter)

404
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,616
Now, let's take care of business.

405
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,372
Out of the way.

406
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,708
This is one invention
you're not getting credit for,

407
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,126
you inspiration-hog!

408
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,045
Your electric hammer, maestro?

409
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,925
Invent your way out of this, Edison!

410
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,051
Hmm?

411
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,303
Hmm.

412
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,687
Look, son, Edison was just like me.

413
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,356
You mean, the wild mood swings?

414
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,565
No!

415
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,777
We both lived in another man's shadow.

416
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,738
This old-timey nerd and I have suffered

417
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:44,034
the same frustration and heartache.
We're not rivals.

418
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:48,789
We're just a couple of dreamers
who set the bar a little too high.

419
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,543
-I can't destroy your work, my friend.
-Can I?

420
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:57,631
No, but we'll stop off
at the da Vinci museum on the way home.

421
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,259
Uh, I think that's in Italy, Dad.

422
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,469
Oh! Well, then we'll take
it out on Eli Whitney.

423
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:08,267
<i>Authorities say the phony pope</i>
<i>can be recognized by his high-top sneakers</i>

424
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,477
<i>and incredibly foul mouth.</i>

425
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,855
<i>In other news, Thomas Edison,</i>
<i>the greatest inventor of all time...</i>

426
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,483
-(both gasp)
<i>-...is apparently still inventing.</i>

427
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,902
<i>Despite the notable handicap</i>
<i>of being dead.</i>

428
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,529
That's my Tommy!

429
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,283
MAN (on TV): <i>Two new Edison creations</i>
<i>have just been discovered in his museum</i>

430
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,827
<i>a six-legged chair that won't tip over...</i>

431
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,706
<i>and even more astounding,</i>
<i>an electric hammer.</i>

432
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,624
-(murmuring)
-(applause)

433
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,169
That was your idea.

434
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,672
<i>This brilliant innovation is expected</i>
<i>to generate millions</i>

435
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,258
<i>for Edison's already wealthy heirs.</i>

436
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,428
Dad, those should be your millions.

437
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,347
I got to admit, Homer,
you're taking this pretty well.

438
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:52,269
(gritting teeth) Let's just say
I'm sitting in the right chair.

439
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,106
(theme music playing)

440
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,484
-(murmuring)
-Shh!
