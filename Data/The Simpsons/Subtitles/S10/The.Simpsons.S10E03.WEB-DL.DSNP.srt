00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,922
I want you to march yourself
directly to the Kwik-E-Mart

181
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,299
and get me chips and a beer.

182
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,385
Get somethin'
for yourself, sweetheart.

183
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,639
Shall we bury it or chuck it
into a car full of girls?

184
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,141
Hey, leave it alone!

185
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,768
OK! OK! Don't kill me, killer.

186
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,061
Don't call me that!

187
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,354
Relax, Simpson.

188
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,981
It was either him or you.

189
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,399
No court would convict you.

191
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,196
Bart Simpson,

192
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,906
do you know why you have been

193
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,200
summoned before this tribunal?

194
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,161
Yes, sir. Because I killed
an innocent bird.

195
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,580
Uh! Dear Lord!
We just wanted you to put

196
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,665
fresh newspaper
on the tribunal floor!

197
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,834
We're knee-deep
in our own droppings.

198
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,461
It's disgusting.

199
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,047
But since you've
confessed to bird slaughter,

200
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,591
we have no choice
but to peck your face off.

201
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,134
No! Not the face!

202
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,304

Oww! What are you doing?

206
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,062
I got bored,
so I started slapping you.

207
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,313
[gasps] Uh-oh.

208
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,108

209
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,485
Young man, you're coming home

210
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,736
with me this minute.

211
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,572
All right! Finally, a real home!

212
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,908
Not you. Bart.

213
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,619
Oh! See ya later, killer.

214
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,038
Killer? Why did he call you killer?

215
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,290
Mom, you were right.
Nelson is bad news.

216
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,375
Can we go home?

217
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,293
What are you hiding?

00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,753
-[cats yowling]
-Nothing.

219
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,755
What are those cats doing
behind you?

00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,925
-[cats yowling]
-Uh, cats like me?

221
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,511

Get off. Get off.

[gasps] Bart!

224
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,976
Did you kill that poor bird?

225
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,563
Uh, I didn't mean to, Mom.
The gun pulled to the left.

226
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,565
You disobeyed me, snuck over here

227
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,525
and murdered a helpless animal?

228
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:31,320
I know. I really screwed up.
I deserve to be punished.

229
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,197
What's the point, Bart?

230
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,992
I punish
and I punish and I punish,

231
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,868
but it never sinks in.

232
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,371
So you know what?
Do what you want.

Hi, little eggs. I'm not sure
how to tell you this,

but your--your mom
was involved in an incident.

242

Mistakes were made... by me.

00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,450
But don't worry.

-Dad, they aren't birds.
-Sure, they are.

00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,813
They came from
eggs in a bird's nest.

358
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,273
Therefore, they're birds.

359
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,858
"Ickso fatso."

360
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,777
One, they don't have beaks.

361
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,487
Two, they don't have feathers.

362
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,155
And three, they're lizards!

363
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,949
-You're a lizard!
-Enough bickering.

364
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,158
I know how to settle this.

365
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,576
No kick-boxing.

366
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,204
Oh. If anybody wants me,

367
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,289
I'll be eating
alone in the basement.

368
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,540
[click]

369
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,168
D'oh!
[screaming, groaning]

370
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,548
Now, uh, people,
there's been some confusion

371
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,509
about our bird-sighting rules.

372
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,511
You cannot count birds
that you've seen

373
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,263
at the zoo,
on stamps or in dreams.

374
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,432
Well, I'm back to square one.

375
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,018
[cooing]

376
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,103
Mmm.

377
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,022
My God! A pigeon!

378
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,900
That's the last bird on my list.

379
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,319
[chuckles]
So long, suckers.

380
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,657
Excuse me. Can you tell us
what kind of birds these are?

381
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,492
They hatched from eggs
I found in a nest.

382
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,703
[gasps]
Good heavens!

383
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,288
I'm very glad
you brought those in, Bart.

384
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,291
I'll just get those killed
and you can be on your way.

385
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,376
[gasps]
Wait!

386
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,836
What the heck are you doing?

387
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,838
My civic duty, that's what.

388
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,132
Bolivian Tree Lizard?

389
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,050
Mm-hmm.
It's a vicious Ovoraptor.

390
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,845
It feasts on bird eggs and
lays its own eggs in the nest.

391
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,513
The unsuspecting mother bird

392
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,348
cares for them
until the babies hatch

393
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,434
and... devour her, too.

394
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,602
[laughs]
What a chump!

395
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,855
It's already wiped out the Dodo,

396
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,356
the Cuckoo and the Ne-ne.

397
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,275
And it has nasty plans
for the booby,

398
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,610
the titmouse, the woodcock
and the tit-pecker.

399
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,237
How vile!

400
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,947
Well, the one thing
that mystifies me

401
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,491
is how a Bolivian lizard
made it to Springfield.

402
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,370
[clears throat]
That is a puzzlement.

403
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,334
[grunting]

404
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,128
Ahh!

405
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,629
[humming]

406
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,133
-[shrieks]
-Mmm?

407
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,594
Mmm.

408
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,680
Look, Skinner,
we haven't got all day.

409
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,307
Kill the horrid beasts.

410
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,059
Then do away with their lizards.

411
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,477
No, don't hurt them!

412
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,978
I'll just keep 'em as pets.

413
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,563
No, they might escape and breed.

414
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,441
The law is very clear on this.
They must be exterminated

415
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,568
as quickly
and gruesomely as possible.

416
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,736
[whirring]

417
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,030
No! They're mine!

418
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,365
I'm sure we can work this out.

419
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,827
He's just a child.
Let me talk to him.

420
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,412
All right.
I'll give you a moment.

421
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,748
That'll give us time
to prepare for the splatter.

422
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,379
Bart, I'm sorry,
but there's nothing we can do.

423
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,216
Your lizards are banned
by federal law.

424
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,259
Everyone thinks they're monsters,

425
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,970
but I raised them and I love them.

426
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,348
I know that's
hard to understand.

427
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,851
Mmm. Not as hard as you think.

428
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,228
[sniffles]

429
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,857
Run for it.

430
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,567
Really?

431
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,408
OK, that's exactly one moment.

432
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,078
And-- Oh, my God!
He's getting away!

433
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,246
[gasping, murmuring]

434
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,455
Stop him!

435
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,873
Out of the way, Midge.

436
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,625
Oh, am I in the way?

437
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,045
Yes, yes, you're in the way!
Are you daft, woman?

438
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,714
Sorry. I didn't realize
I was in the way.

439
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,049
You're still in the way.

440
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,801
You don't
seem to be moving at all.

441
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,595
Oh, for cryin' out loud,
just knock her a** down. Unh!

442
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,556
-MOE: Way to shove, Edna.
-APU: Let us roll.

443
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,975
Guys, is it really true?

444
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,144
Are you cold-blooded
egg murderers?

445
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,231
Don't use that look on me.
I invented that look.

446
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,236
There he is,
off in the distance!

447
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,612
[whimpering, panting]

448
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,947
SMITHERS: He's getting away!

449
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,492
[panting]

450
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,910
[gasps]

451
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:22,995
OK, Bart.

452
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,165
This is where it ends.
Relinquish the lizards.

453
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,332
[gasping]

454
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,376
I said relinquish.

455
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,880
-Aah!
-[both grunting]

456
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,798
-[Marge gasps]
-[grunting continues]

457
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:35,966
-Uhh!
-Oh!

458
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,718
Oh, no!

459
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,181
You killed 'em!
[groans]

460
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,391
Good riddance to bad lizards.

461
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:53,317
Hmm? Hey! Whoa! Look at 'em!

462
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,195
Go, chirpy boy! Go, Bart Junior!

463
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,779
Oh, nuts!

464
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,114
Wow! Did you know they had

465
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,908
those webbed flaps for gliding?

466
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,660
Yes. But I was hoping
they didn't know that.

467
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,919
Well, I hope you're happy, Bart.

468
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,671
You have no idea
what kind of plague

469
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,381
you've unleashed upon this town.

470
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,551
<i>Our top story,</i>

471
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,261
<i>The population of parasitic</i>

472
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,472
<i>tree lizards has exploded</i>

473
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,099
<i>and local citizens</i>
<i>couldn't be happier.</i>

474
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,893
<i>It seems the rapacious reptiles</i>

475
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,020
<i>have developed a taste</i>
<i>for the common pigeon,</i>

476
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:33,273
<i>also known as the feathered rat,</i>
<i>or gutter bird.</i>

477
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,318
<i>For the first time, citizens</i>

478
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,987
<i>by flocks of chattering disease-bags.</i>

479
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,161
For decimating
our pigeon population

480
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,872
and making Springfield
a less oppressive place

481
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,083
to while away our worthless lives,

482
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:55,003
I present you
with this scented candle.

483
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,297
[all cheering]

484
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,715
Yeah! All right!

485
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:02,469
Well, I was wrong.
The lizards are a godsend!

486
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,304
But isn't that a bit shortsighted?

487
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,890
What happens when
we're overrun by lizards?

488
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,559
No problem. We simply unleash
wave after wave

489
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,437
of Chinese needle snakes.
They'll wipe out the lizards.

490
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,523
But aren't
the snakes even worse?

491
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,275
Yes, but we're prepared for that.

492
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,277
We've lined up
a fabulous type of gorilla

493
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,611
that thrives on snake meat.

494
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,154
But then we're stuck with gorillas!

495
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,823
No, that's the beautiful part.

496
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,283
When wintertime rolls around,

497
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,034
the gorillas
simply freeze to death.

498
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,911
Hmm.

499
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,664
I'm proud of you, boy.

500
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:34,668
[sniffs]
Mmm. Loganberry.

501
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,296
I don't get it, Bart.

502
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,630
You got upset when you killed

503
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,173
one bird, but now you've killed

504
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,466
tens of thousands,

505
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,051
and it doesn't bother you at all.

506
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,220
Hey, you're right.

507
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,056
-I call the front seat!
-You had it on the way over!
