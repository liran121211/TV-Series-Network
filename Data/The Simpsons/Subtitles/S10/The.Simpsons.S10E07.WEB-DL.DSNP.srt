00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,185
(bell ringing)

3
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,316
(buzzing)

4
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,107
D-oh!
(screams)

5
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,167
REV. LOVEJOY:
...And may we burn

6
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,670
in painful
and foul-smelling fire

7
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,757
forever and ever.

8
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,843
A...men...

9
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,805
...onite minister
will be giving a guest sermon

10
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,306
next Sunday.

11
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,016
Go in peace.

12
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,018
A...
(coughs)

13
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,686
Don't make me come up there.

14
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,146
-...men.
-HOMER: Whoo-hoo!

15
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,732
MOE: Let me outta here.
The guy never stops talking.

16
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,860
-(stomach growling)
-Oh.

17
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,237
I'm starving.

18
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,239
Mom, can we go catholic

19
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,949
so we can get communion wafers
and booze?

20
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,284
No. No one's going catholic.

21
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,370
Three children is enough,
thank you.

22
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,789
Hang in there, son.
I'm taking us out

23
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,874
for our traditional
Sunday brunch.

24
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,002
DRIVER: Idiot!
HOMER: He zinged you, Marge.

25
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,963
(giggling)

26
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,632
-(gasps)
-Brunch is served.

27
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,509
(smacking loudly)

28
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,469
I feel guilty
coming here every Sunday

29
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,388
and never actually
buying anything.

30
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,014
Why? We're following the rules.

31
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,643
If it has
a toothpick in it, it's free.

32
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,063
-Hey.
-(smacking)

33
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,319
Ah, this is my kind of aisle,

34
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,697
soy substitute,
whiz-less cheese...

35
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,408
(gasps)
Oven-roasted cud.

36
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,118
It's packed in its own drool.

37
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,289
Gavin, honey,
help Mommy pick a cereal.

38
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,332
(gasps)
How about alfalfa-bits?

39
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,750
Those suck.

40
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,252
I hate this store.

41
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,753
But, sweetheart, Mommy--

42
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,547
I hate you , too.

43
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,424
I want to live
with one of my dads.

44
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,508
Mmm.

45
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,970
So you say this product
is known as fudge?

46
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,848
Yes, just like it was last week.

47
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,932
If you're going to get snippy,

48
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,309
I'll take my business elsewhere.

49
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,770
Cherry Garcia? Yuck.

50
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,190
Honey Bono?
Desmond Tutti Fruitti?

51
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,274
Ech.

52
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,319
Lisa, help Daddy find
some normal flavors.

53
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,778
(grunts)

54
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,780
Candy Warhol?

55
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,073
Xavier Nougat?

56
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,783
Nah. Nothing made of dead guys.

57
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,910
What's in the back?

58
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,245
-(grunting)
-(shivering)

59
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,915
Hurry up!
My hands are getting cold.

60
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,916
(Lisa sneezes)

61
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,292
Oh, my goodness, Homer,

62
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,543
get her out of there!

63
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,794
Ohh!

64
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,466
Ugh. Sherbet Hoover?

65
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,926
Oh. We've got to get you home

66
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,136
to a warm blanket
and a cold compress.

67
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,304
Whoo!

68
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,514
(grunting)

69
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,682
(man clearing throat)

70
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,893
Those are eight dollars
a pound, sport.

71
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,436
Hmm. Eight dollars a pound times

72
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,021
say, oh, five pounds is, umm...

73
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,064
Let's see.

74
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,732
How many pounds in a gallon?

75
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,859
Oh, I can't afford that.

76
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,277
(gasps)
Unless...

77
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,366
(sneezes)

78
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,494
(laughing)
I told you I'm a financial genius.

79
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,870
I buy an eight-dollar lobster,

80
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,747
fatten it into an $80 lobster

81
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,957
and eat the profits.

82
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,417
Lobsters need saltwater.

83
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,127
I'm way ahead of you.

84
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,716
BART: Dad, the fish.

85
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,968
Son, I'm still fine-tuning.

86
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,469
Eh-eh.

87
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,595
Uh-oh!

88
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,680
Eh-eh.

89
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,057
Perfect.

90
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,433
(sneezes)

91
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,644
Oh, you don't sound so good.

92
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,437
We'd better get you
some cold medicine.

93
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,314
No problem, I picked
some up at the store!

94
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,732
Oh.

95
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,278
Oh, Homey,

96
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,862
you made breakfast.

97
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,824
Nothing's too good
for my one and only.

98
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,119
Eat, eat. You're nothing
but skin and bones.

99
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,453
(sneezes)

100
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,705
Oh.

101
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,707
Oh, how are you feeling, sweetie?

102
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,874
(nasally voice)
Much better.

103
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,167
(sneezes)

104
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,129
Oh, my. You're burning up.

105
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,006
I'm going to tell the school
you're staying home.

106
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,466
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

107
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,551
Lisa...

108
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,553
Mom, no, wait!

109
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,971
We can make a deal!

110
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,973
You don't have anything I want.

111
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,474
Ohh...

112
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,935
NARRATOR:
<i>The ocean abounds</i>

113
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,437
<i>with fearsome creatures,</i>

114
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,981
<i>but none attacks its prey</i>
<i>with more fury</i>

115
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,524
<i>than the seaweed shark.</i>

116
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,445
<i>The struggle is soon over.</i>

117
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:24,115
Oh. You shouldn't be
watching the learning channel.

118
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,533
You need to take it easy.

119
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,577
But I'm hardly learning at all.

120
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,203
Why don't you play
with one of Bart's

121
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,747
video games instead?

122
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,041
Hugh Downs says
they're the latest craze.

123
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,381
-(sighs)
-(evil laughter)

124
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,967
<i>Foolish dingo,</i>
<i>you must find and devour</i>

125
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,594
<i>the seven crystal babies,</i>

126
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,512
<i>or spend eternity trapped</i>

128

(evil laughter)

129
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,101
I am so scared.

130
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,978
All right. I guess you're supposed

131
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,938
to go through this stupid door?

132
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,150
Hmm. I wonder
what's in this glowing barrel.

133
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,278
What? Nunchuks?
Those aren't even australian.

134
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,867
Oh, great. So I'm dead now.

135
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,453
Fine. I'm sick
of this stupid game anyway.

136
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,414
Yes! I am just
four power wands away

137
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,124
from an antigravity lozenge.

138
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,627
(gasps) Hope I don't run
into that weird little troll.

139
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,711
Hi, Lisa.

140
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,338
LISA: No, pause, pause!

141
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,923
I brought your homework.

142
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,216
We have to read this.

143
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,426
LISA: <i>The Wind In The Willows</i>?

144
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,096
It's about a toad
and a badger and a mole.

145
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,223
I drawed on mine.
(chuckles)

146
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,682
Is this my house?

147
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,518
No. You live in a different house.

148
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,146
Choo-choo-choo, whoo, whoo!

149
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,857
Then I shall rule
The Down Underverse!

150
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,275
(evil laughter)

151
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,361
We'll see about that, mate.

152
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,575
HOMER: Okay, together
we weigh 300 pounds.

153
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,494
According to my driver's license,

154
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,413
I weigh 140 pounds.

155
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,373
That means that you weigh, ohh...

156
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,792
160 pounds.

157
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,585
Oh-ho-ho! You're doing great.

158
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,711
No, no!

159
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,880
Yep! That's it! Bite, bite, bite!

160
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,674
-(knock at door)
-MARGE: Lisa?

161
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,261
Oh, sweetie,
you look so much better.

162
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,637
Ready to go back to school?

163
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,972
Uh, I don't know.

164
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,599
(coughing)
I mean, I could risk it, but...

165
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,518
No, no, you just stay put.

166
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,479
Wow. You didn't even feel
her forehead.

167
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,106
How do I get
that kind of credibility?

168
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,442
With eight years
of scrupulous honesty.

169
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,110
Eh. It's not worth it.

170
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,781
Oh, I really need
one more day, mom.

171
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,950
I think the germs are regrouping.

172
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,535
Now, for breakfast,
I'll have hash browns,

173
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,453
coffee and a short stack.

174
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,954
And would it kill you
to heat up the syrup?

175
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:37,748
(tires screeching)

176
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,668
But I... I might infect the other kids.

177
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,670
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

178
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,213
So long!

179
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,299
Welcome back, Lisa.

180
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,009
I trust you got
the homework I assigned.

181
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,010
<i>The Wind In The Willows</i>?

182
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,344
Oh, yeah, Ralph brought it over.

183
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,222
Perfect. Then I won't need
to excuse you from the test.

184
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,765
(gulps)
Test?

185
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,934
(Taskmaster's voice):
Game over, mate.

186
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,686
Ohh...

187
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,317
Okay, all right.

188
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,861
You can bluff your way
through one test.

189
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,988
"Mr. Toad has a red blank."

190
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,156
Okay, skip that one.

191
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,826
"Mr. blank needs a blank
in order to blank his blank."

192
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,787
Oh, I am in deep blank.

193
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,706
And the lowest grade in the class...

194
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,374
She's going to say my name.

195
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,168
Lisa Simpson, zero.

196
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,127
(gasps)

197
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,045
-SKINNER: Lisa...
-(gasps)

198
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,297
...the president of Harvard
would like a word with you.

199
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,424
Nasty business, that zero.

200
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,761
Naturally Harvard's doors
are now closed to you,

201
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,596
but I'll pass your file along to...

202
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,097
(snickering)
Brown.

203
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,099
Hmm. Heck of a school.

204
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,100
Weren't you at Brown, Otto?

205
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,978
Yep. Almost got tenure, too.

206
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,648
(gasps)
No! Not Brown,

207
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,941
Brown, Brown, Brown...

208
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,943
Lisa, you're saying Brown
an awful lot.

209
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:47,860
Are you okay?

210
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,904
Well, actually,

211
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,323
I do feel a little feverish.

212
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,200
Ah. Don't worry about the test.

213
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,952
Just get yourself
a nice drink of water.

214
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,079
Then come back and finish the test.

215
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,372
(gulps)

216
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,543
I need a miracle.

217
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,379
-Come on. You owe me.
-What's up, sis?

218
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,756
-Bart, shouldn't you be in class?
-I am.

219
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,134
It's a little something
I whipped up at shop, mostly latex.

220
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,219
What are you doing out here?

221
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,555
We've got a test,
and I didn't read the book.

222
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,473
I'll get a zero for sure, Bart.

223
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,766
What do I do?

224
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,685
Well, if it was me,
I'd just take the zero.

225
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,104
-(growls)
-Uh, but that's not for everyone.

226
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,439
There's one other possibility.

227
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,984
Hey, I can't go in there.

228
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,319
Relax. There's nothing here
you didn't see

229
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,779
when Dad boycotted pants.

230
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,910
NELSON: Hang on. I'll buzz you in.

231
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,745
Buzz!

232
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,247
Teacher and subject?

233
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,790
Miss Hoover, <i>Wind In The Willows.</i>

234
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:47,211
Hmm-hmm-hmm. Oh.

235
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,129
Here we go.

236
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,798
(gasps)
Oh, my god.

237
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,508
These are the answers to the test.

238
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,884
I don't want to cheat.

239
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,928
Hey, hey, these are study aids.

240
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,097
They're for novelty purposes only.

241
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,890
If a few bad apples
use them for cheating,

242
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,350
I can't be held responsible.

243
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,351
Forget it.

244
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,853
I'd rather get a zero.

245
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,771
Good for you, lass.

246
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,940
I got me a zero once

247
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,693
and my life turned out just fine.

248
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,903
Oh! Whoa!

249
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,905
That's a nasty clog.

250
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:18,117
Ooh, you've got yourself
a partner, have you?

251
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,535
(grunting)

252
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,329
Keep the change.

253
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,497
WILLIE: Come here,
you slippery rascals.

254
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,250
Good news, my delicious friend.

255
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,919
You're going to be
a free-range lobster.

256
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,881
Come on, boy. Dig in.

257
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,258
They'll give you
a big, strong thorax.

258
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,384
Whoa!

259
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,054
Why, you little... Ah!

260
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,515
Ohh, look at him cower.

261
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,184
Just like the boy.

262
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,853
I can't stay mad
at such a helpless little mammal.

263
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,023
(giggles) I'm gonna get you
for that, you little scamp.

264
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,941
Here! Yeah! Take that, Pinchy.

265
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,152
(giggling)

266
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,405
I graded this morning's test
over lunch

267
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,907
and most of you did quite well.

268
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,993
-I got a B.
-No, Ralph. That's an F.

269
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,662
I must have spilled some kahlua.

270
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,163
Perfect, Lisa.

271
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,582
And you got
all the extra-credit questions.

272
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,668
Even the one that got
cut off by the copy machine.

273
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,504
Oh,well, I guess
I was just on a roll.

274
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,880
(groans)

275
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,840
Don't be so modest, Lisa.

276
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,134
You earned that A+++.

277
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,719
Actually, there are four pluses.

278
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,429
No, that's drambuie.

279
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,473
Mmm.

280
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,643
Ooh, so plump and juicy.

281
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,812
Hmm! He's going to boil up nicely.

282
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:28,854
(slurps)

283
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,190
Well, I guess this is it, old pal.

284
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,942
This is your big day.

285
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,151
The water's boiling.

286
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,277
Quick. Chuck him in.

287
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,029
-Uh...
-Come on. Chuck him in.

288
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,699
-Okay.
-Let's go! In the pot, in the pot!

289
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,033
Ohh.

290
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,288
-But, Marge, look at the little guy.
-(gasps)

291
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,707
(growling)

292
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,958
He looks like an ordinary...

293
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,501
Ow! Son of a--

294
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,586
Feel that, Marge? He likes you.

295
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,382
And now, for the main course...

296
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,635
Steamed Maine cabbages.

297
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,846
(clears throat)
Pardon me for asking,

298
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,472
but where the hell's
my stupid lobster?

299
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,515
We're not eating Mr. Pinchy.

300
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,891
He's part of the family now.

301
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,436
(grunts)

302
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,771
Pinchy, I made you some risotto.

303
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,689
Dad!

304
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:12,857
BART:
What, you got to be kidding me.

305
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,859
What's your problem, veggie?
You don't even eat lobster.

306
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,610
No, but I enjoy the smell.

307
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,028
Well, lobster or no lobster,

308
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,905
this is still a very special dinner.

309
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,533
(humming fanfare)

310
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,493
Lisa broke her own record

311
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,078
by two whole pluses.

312
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,247
Mom, where did you get that?

313
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,875
Oh, it just turned up in the course
of my daily rummaging.

314
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,085
By the way, I oiled
the hinge on your diary.

315
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,881
Aren't you proud
of your big sister, Mr. Pinchy?

316
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,132
Hmm? Hmm?

317
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,510
Oh, I am sick of everyone
being so proud of me!

318
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,138
That's my girl!

319
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,765
BART: Ah, cheer up, Lise.

320
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,683
You got a good grade
without even reading the book.

321
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,601
That's win-win.

322
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,602
Can't you see the difference

323
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,563
between earning something
honestly and getting it by fraud?

324
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,317
Hmm, I suppose, maybe if, uh...

325
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,695
No. No, sorry, I thought
I had it there for a sec.

326
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,906
(bell ringing)

327
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,367
Psst, Lisa, check it out.

328
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,203
Tomorrow's fraction quiz.

329
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,496
I'll give you the numerators free,

330
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,539
but the denominators
are going to cost you.

331
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,625
I don't want
your dirty denominators.

332
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,753
-Well, la-dee-da, lady cheaterly.
-(gasps)

333
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,296
Can I at least
keep you in my rolodex?

334
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,422
No!

335
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,217
I never cheated before
and I never will again.

336
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,220
Oh, I almost wish I hadn't
gotten away with it.

337
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,346
SKINNER (over speakers):
<i>Lisa Simpson,</i>

338
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,389
<i>report to the principal's office</i>

339
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,226
<i>to discuss the results</i>
<i>of yesterday's test.</i>

340
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,393
We never met.

341
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,357
SKINNER: I've just received
some rather unusual news

342
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,693
regarding your unprecedented
A triple plus.

343
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,447
To be honest, I'm surprised
and saddened.

344
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,449
Uh, no, not saddened.

345
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,492
What's the word?

346
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,827
Ah, yes. Delighted.

347
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,079
-What?
-I'm delighted to report

348
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,539
that your grade

349
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,415
brought the entire school's G.P.A.

350
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,793
up to our state's
minimum standard.

351
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,546
We now qualify
for a basic assistance grant.

352
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,841
It's the greatest honor
the school has ever received.

353
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,677
And it's all thanks to you.

354
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,220
Your devotion to scholarship

355
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,472
is a shining beacon to all who...

356
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,391
Stop it! I cheated!

357
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:13,561
Cheated, cheated,
cheated, cheated, cheated!

358
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,479
Lisa, what are you trying to say?

359
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,856
I cheated!!

360
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,357
(gasps)

361
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,027
SKINER: You cheated?

362
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,864
Oh, lordy, lordy, lordy.

363
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,282
Why didn't Miss Hoover tell me?

364
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,867
She doesn't know.

365
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,368
You're the only one I've told.

366
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,538
Well, then...

367
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,999
one could make the argument

368
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,710
that there really is no problem.

369
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,461
But what I did was wrong.

370
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,796
Oh, very much so,

371
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,131
but as long as we handle this

372
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,967
in a mature and above all,
quiet manner,

373
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,635
we'll still get that grant money.

374
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,846
(chuckles)

375
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,180
Oh, you really scared me there.

376
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,182
But we can't accept that money.

377
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,142
It's tainted.

378
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,144
Now, now.
Leave the money out of this.

379
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,896
It's not the money's fault
you cheated.

380
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,189
Besides, I've already
started spending it.

381
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,524
Check out the new scoreboard.

382
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,068
-(fanfare plays)
-CROWD: <i>Charge!</i>

383
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,278
(laughs)

384
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,696
I'm still learning all the buttons.

385
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,740
Well, if you're going
to cover this up,

386
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,992
I'll just have to go
over your head to Super...

387
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,285
-(buzzer sounds)
-...intendent...

388
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,953
-(buzzer sounds)
-...Chalmers!

389
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,456
(explosion)

390
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,667
Skinner!

391
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,086
I am outraged
that you've kept this from me.

392
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,671
You were supposed to call

393
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,798
as soon as
the new scoreboard was in.

394
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,675
Tell me, does it play
that song "Charge"?

395
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,344
Oh, does it ever!

396
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,220
(grunts)
You can't keep this scoreboard

397
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,640
because there's not going to be
any grant money

398
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,934
because I cheated!

399
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,354
Lisa, let's take a walk.

400
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,941
A little traveling music, Seymour.

401
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,944
(stadium organ music plays)

402
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,571
(grunts)
Good lord, what a dump.

403
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,572
-(dog barking)
-(cat meowing)

404
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,990
It's not surprising this school

405
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,158
was once classified

406
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,869
the most dilapidated
in all of Missouri.

407
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,704
-LISA: Hmm?
-That's why it was shut down

408
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,122
and moved here, brick by brick.

409
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,582
Look around, Lisa.

410
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,001
That grant money
could do a lot of good.

411
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,336
Don't you think those youngsters

412
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,296
deserve a regulation tetherball?

413
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,882
-Ow!
-Ohh!

414
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,968
We can buy real periodic tables

415
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,387
instead of these promotional ones
from Oscar Mayer.

416
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,722
Now who can tell me
the atomic weight of bolgnium?

417
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,724
Oh, delicious?

418
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,642
Correct.

419
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,978
I would also accept
"snacktacular."

420
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,646
And for the first time ever,

421
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,065
our computer lab
actually has a computer in it.

422
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,154
Hi, Lisa.

423
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,490
Hi, Supernintendo Chalmers.

424
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,118
Meow.

425
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,911
I'm learnding.

426
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,955
Ah, way to go, Ralph.

427
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,290
Oh, she's a beaut.
You can't beat a coleco.

428
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,418
How many
can I put you down for? A lot?

429
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,460
Please say a lot.

430
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,753
I need this.

431
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,796
I don't know.

432
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,132
I'm not even sure
we can keep this one.

433
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,925
It's up to Lisa.

434
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,135
What do you say, Lisa?

435
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,678
Will you keep our little secret

436
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,014
for the good of your classmates
and your school?

437
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,890
And let's not forget old Gil, huh?

438
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,518
(chuckles)
The wolf's at old Gil's door.

439
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:09,194
Uh... I guess
I don't have much choice.

440
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,155
Oh, thank god!

441
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,614
Now let's talk rust-proofing.

442
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,534
These colecos
will rust up on you like that.

443
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,452
Shut up, Gil.

444
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,328
Close the deal, close the deal.

445
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,415
Relax, boy.

446
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,125
We're not going to cook you.

447
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,835
Enjoy your day at the beach.

448
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,047
Ooh, look. Here's a little
playmate for you.

449
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,257
(whimpering)

450
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,761
Hey, you don't have to take that
from no punk-ass crab.

451
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,304
What's wrong with you?

452
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,556
Grr, it's not his fault he's a sissy.

453
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,059
Someone's been coddling him.

454
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,477
Don't look at me.

455
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,853
I wanted to eat him.

456
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,064
Sorry. It's usually the mother.

457
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,858
You know, I run a small academy

458
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,318
for lobsters like this one.

459
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,986
We stress tough love,

460
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,696
daily chores and the like.

461
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,157
No. We're not sending
the lobster away

462
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,451
to some snobby boarding school.

463
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,952
Arr, I understand.

464
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,537
It... It's hard to let go.

465
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,164
Eh, tell me this then.

466
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,750
Do you have any spare change?

467
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,711
SKINNER: And now

468
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,213
to present the grant money,

469
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,216
a legendary figure
in educational disbursement,

470
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,551
State comptroller, Atkins.

471
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,221
Whoo!

472
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,017
Thank you.

473
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,477
I'm here tonight to honor the girl

474
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,145
whose unprecedented test score

475
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,939
has set a new standard
in excellence.

476
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,315
Lisa.

477
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,983
(applause)

478
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:32,778
Thank you.

479
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,363
I know this giant check

480
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,406
is very important to everyone here.

481
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,118
But what's even more important
is the truth.

482
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,953
(all muttering)

483
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,957
Because, after all,
education is the search for truth.

484
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,999
No. No, it isn't.

485
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,918
Don't listen to her.
She's out of her mind.

486
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,546
And the truth is,
we don't deserve this grant

487
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,297
and I don't deserve your applause.

488
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,799
I cheated on that test.

489
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,884
(audience gasping)

490
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,138
Wait. How dare
you condemn this girl?

491
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,807
Who among you can honestly say
you've never cheated?

492
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,017
On your wives or your husbands?

493
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,727
(all muttering)

494
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,771
What she just did took courage.

495
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,898
And where I come from, Canada,

496
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,024
we reward courage.

497
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,485
So I hereby decree
that you keep the grant

498
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,572
and let's give this brave girl
the ovation she deserves.

499
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,991
(applause)

500
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,123
Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you.

501
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,917
You got the highest grade
in the class.

502
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,587
-But, mom...
-The highest grade.

503
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,173
Okay, Lisa's gone.

504
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,300
Places, people.

505
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,888
Oh, man, acting is tough.

506
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,140
I'll be in my trailer.

507
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,434
Ah, good old predictable Lisa.

508
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,353
I knew her conscience
was a ticking time bomb.

509
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,605
Heads up.

510
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,190
Here comes the real comptroller.

511
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,692
COMPTROLLER:
This grant ensures

512
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,944
a light bulb in every classroom

513
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,822
and a high-definition TV
for the teachers' lounge.

514
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,824
(applause)

515
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:06,330
Now, where's the little girl
who made this grant possible?

516
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,539
Where's Lisa Simpson?

517
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,835
(applause)

518
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,878
Come on up here, Lisa.

519
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,132
Now how about that?
Smart and modest.

520
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,259
Well, I should be going now.

521
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,303
These giant checks
don't hand themselves out.

522
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,306
Okay, people, let's have
a round of applause

523
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,225
for the real comptroller.

524
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,477
-COMPTROLLER: Hmm.
-(applause)

525
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:29,937
CHALMERS: Idiot.

526
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,730
I know a liquor store

527
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,815
where we can cash this right now.

528
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,443
(cheering)

529
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,780
LISA: And done.

530
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,282
That's one grade I truly earned.

531
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,493
Ohh, who left
these muddy claw prints

532
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,161
on my clean floor?

533
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,079
Sorry, Marge.

534
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,414
Pinchy got all dirty
in the yard chasing birds.

535
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,834
But don't worry,
I put him in a nice, hot bath.

536
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,045
(sniffs)
Hey, what smells so good?

537
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,004
Yeah...

538
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,381
Pinchy?

539
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:58,966
Pinchy?

540
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,301
Oh, Pinchy!

541
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,511
(crying)

542
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,181
(Homer sobbing)

543
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,395
(sobbing loudly)

544
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,897
Oh, man, that's good.

545
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,149
(sobbing loudly)

546
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,442
Pass the butter.

547
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,653
(sobbing loudly)

548
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,490
Are you going to eat that
all by yourself?

549
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,992
Uh-huh.

550
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,953
Pinchy would've wanted it this way.

551
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,540
My dear, sweet Pinchy.

552
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,713
No more pain
where you are now, boy.

553
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,423
(grunts)

554
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,759
(sucks)
Oh, god, that's tasty.

555
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,804
I wish Pinchy were here
to enjoy this.

556
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,517
(smacking)

557
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,561
Oh, Pinchy.

558
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,192
(theme music playing)

559
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,150
Shh.
