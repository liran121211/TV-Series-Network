(tires screeching)

3
00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:09,056
D'oh!

4
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:09,556
(tires screeching)

5
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,158
(grunts)

6
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:13,394
ALL: Huh?

7
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:17,197
D'oh!

8
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:19,166
(Homer groans)

9
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,534
No parking spots?

10
00:00:20,569 --> 00:00:22,136
Lousy butt-kissers,

11
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:23,771
coming in before noon,

12
00:00:23,806 --> 00:00:26,874
eating donuts that are rightfully mine.

13
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,109
Oh, oh, oh!

14
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:31,679
D'oh! Stupid Smart Car.

15
00:00:31,714 --> 00:00:32,913
(tires screech)

16
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:36,150
D'oh! Spot-hogging S.U.V.

17
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:37,618
(tires screech)

18
00:00:37,653 --> 00:00:40,354
D'oh! Inconvenient sinkhole.

19
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:41,522
(tires screech)

20
00:00:41,557 --> 00:00:44,024
D'oh! Mandatory credit.

21
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,259
(tires screech)

22
00:00:45,294 --> 00:00:46,827
D'oh! "Developed by"?

23
00:00:46,862 --> 00:00:49,096
What does that even mean?

24
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:51,098
(gasps) It's empty!

25
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:52,466
Homer, no!

26
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:54,001
That's Burns' spot.

27
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:55,369
How could you miss that sign?

28
00:00:55,404 --> 00:00:57,538
Oof. The last guy that
parked there is now a...

29
00:00:57,573 --> 00:00:58,672
(quietly): speed bump.

30
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:01,375
(muffled): Slow down!

31
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,177
Guys, be cool.

32
00:01:03,212 --> 00:01:05,112
Burns'll never know.

33
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:08,315
He's on vacation this week with
his weirdo hunting buddies.

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,655
Fellow members of the Order of
the Knights of Saint Caucasian,

35
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,024
we've got a lot of things
to kill today, so...

36
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:19,326
release the sedated quail.

37
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:25,833
(gun clicks)

38
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:28,235
How am I supposed to
hunt it if it can move?

39
00:01:31,707 --> 00:01:34,742
Try it now, Davy Crockett!

40
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:39,046
Damn you, surface tension...

41
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:41,148
Wait a minute.

42
00:01:41,183 --> 00:01:44,385
If I can park in Mr. Burns' space,

43
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,086
I can live his whole life!

44
00:01:46,122 --> 00:01:48,555
Quickly now, before I think it through!

45
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:51,225

up his hitty stick

71
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,121
and gets ready to clobber
the dimpled round-o.

72
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:56,423
He's calling the signals.

73
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,425
(yelling): Omaha! 35!

74
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:00,594
Hut! Hut! Simpson!

00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:01,929
(shrieks)

76
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,165
Incoming!

(yelling): There's a
lightbulb out on level P-2!

78
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:11,205
Oh, good lord.

79
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,640
The trapdoor is under renovation.
It's not safe!

80
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:15,576
(air rushing past)

81
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:17,978
(grunting)

82
00:03:20,182 --> 00:03:21,448

00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:26,787
Congratulations.

86
00:03:26,822 --> 00:03:28,222
You're halfway down.

87
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:29,256

88
00:03:31,527 --> 00:03:32,526

Ow!

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,502
I'm drowning in cement!

92
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:44,171
- Uh, it's actually concrete.
- Woo hoo!

93
00:03:44,206 --> 00:03:46,173
Of which cement is an ingredient.

94
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,009
(yells): No!

95
00:03:49,044 --> 00:03:51,512

MARGE: Perfect.

99
00:03:57,653 --> 00:03:59,353
(chuckles) Marge,

100
00:03:59,388 --> 00:04:01,155
you've thought of everything.

101
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,390
Except for one nagging detail.

102
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:06,360
Did I ever tell you about the
time<i> I</i> was in a big cast?

103
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:09,730
It was the Shelbyville Players
production of<i> Pippin.</i>

104
00:04:09,765 --> 00:04:11,698
- Don't worry, Homie.
- GRAMPA: I went from player

105
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:14,301
to ticket taker in one performance!

106
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:16,170
There's two ways of...

107
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:18,205

108
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,017
You are in my seat.

109
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:31,552
Fight! Fight! Fight!

110
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:34,087
Asthma, glasses, asthma!

111
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:35,589
(grunts)

112
00:04:35,624 --> 00:04:38,525
(cheering, yelling)

113
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,694
Oh. There's too much violence

114
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:42,596
in rearview mirrors these days.

115
00:04:46,635 --> 00:04:47,935
HOMER: <i>Hey, boy,</i>

116
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,436

<i>No problemo.</i>

118
00:04:52,374 --> 00:04:53,340
(marker squeaking)

119
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,675
What does it say?

120
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,943
Don't worry about it.

121
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:57,244
What did you write?

122
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,745
Sorry. That's between me

123
00:04:58,781 --> 00:04:59,947
and everyone who sees it.

124
00:04:59,982 --> 00:05:01,715
- HOMER: I need to know!
- Hmm.

125
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,618
Begins with F and ends in C-K.

126
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:05,752
Why you little!

127
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:08,055
(grunting, groaning)

128
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,289
(chuckles)

129
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,626
HOMER: Tell me!

130
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:13,894
Never!

131
00:05:13,929 --> 00:05:15,429

00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:19,900
Woo hoo! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!

D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!

D'oh...

139
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:26,640
Woo hoo!

MARGE: <i>Thanks, partner.</i>

141
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:33,447
We've balled up all the 13 gauge alpaca.

142
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:35,816
Now maybe there's
something fun we can do?

143
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:37,918
Sure is. A puzzle.

144
00:05:37,953 --> 00:05:39,419
"Foggy Day in Berlin."

145
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,588
5,000 pieces.

146
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:42,823
Hmm...

147
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,827
(German accent): Homer,
complete the puzzle!

148
00:05:46,862 --> 00:05:48,061
I'm a married man!

149
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,463
Fine. If you need me,

150
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:51,431
I'll be in your<i> schpankenbank.</i>

FEMALE SINGER: ♪ We'll meet again ♪

152
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:58,472
Marge, I don't think we
should do this puzzle.

153
00:05:58,507 --> 00:06:01,241
I know. You can't pick up the pieces.

154
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:04,645
That's why I've devised a grid system.

155
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,581
Huh? I'll hold up a piece,
and you call out the number

156
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:10,417
and letter of the
corresponding grid square.

157
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:11,752
Uh... I don't know.

158
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:12,853
Q 15?

159
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:15,622
Sweetie, it's a side piece.

160
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:17,324
Q 15's in the middle.

161
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:19,026
Right. Q 15 is in the middle.

162
00:06:19,061 --> 00:06:21,194
Nothing more fun than rules.

163
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,864
I'll make some tea to help you think.

164
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:26,633
Oh, I hate being immobile and numb.

165
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:28,702

167
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:33,874

168
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,876
(excited chatter)

169
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:38,979
It's never pleasant to see
this kind of activity, Lisa.

170
00:06:39,014 --> 00:06:41,581
Particularly on a cell phone
that is so much nicer

171
00:06:41,617 --> 00:06:43,150
than the one I own.

172
00:06:46,255 --> 00:06:50,057
All the fighting seems to start
with who sits where on the bus.

173
00:06:50,092 --> 00:06:52,993
Um, Lisa. You seem to have a
handle on the bus problem.

174
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:56,029
Why don't you tackle it? But
don't think I won't help.

175
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:57,531
I'm providing you with a sash.

176
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:58,865
Skinner!

177
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:01,168
You are asking a six-year-old girl

178
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:03,236
to fix this school's problems.

179
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:04,571
I'm eight.

180
00:07:04,606 --> 00:07:05,939
Oh, carry on.

181
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:09,009
What do you mean, there's a legal issue

182
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:10,310
with my trapdoor?

183
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,079
And, uh, as you explain,

184
00:07:12,114 --> 00:07:14,247
please take two steps back.

185
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:16,383
The old trapdoor was perfectly legal.

186
00:07:16,418 --> 00:07:18,985
It was grandfathered in
under the Reagan-era code.

187
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,821
But once you start renovating it,

188
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:23,724
it has to brought up
to modern standards.

189
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,593
Mm. And it has to be
handicap accessible.

190
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:28,662
A wheelchair would never fall
through the current opening.

191
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:30,230
(chuckling): Oh! But
that's not a problem!

192
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:31,865
I refuse to hire the handicapped.

193
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,266
That's another issue.

194
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:36,103
But for now, we have left ourselves open

195
00:07:36,138 --> 00:07:38,505
to a lawsuit by Homer Simpson.

196
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,241
Fine. Smithers, go see
this Simpson character

197
00:07:41,276 --> 00:07:43,543
and trick him into signing
a waiver of liability.

198
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:45,746
I'll discuss things with the foreman.

199
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,317
(yelling): <i>Enrique,
mas grande la puerta!</i>

200
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:51,651
(Homer moans)

201
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:54,554
Look, Homie! We got
three pieces together.

202
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,089
That's a good day's work!

203
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,924
Why don't we do one of Maggie's puzzles?

204
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,495
Cow goes in the cow-shaped hole, boom.
Next case.

205
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,398
Hmm, I thought the one good thing
about you hurting yourself

206
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:06,700
was that we could spend
more time together.

207
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:07,901
You did?

208
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:08,902
Didn't you?

209
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:11,405
Oh yeah, sure, of course.

210
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,408
Only a fool would admit otherwise.

211
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:15,475
Mm....

212
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:16,510
(doorbell rings)

213
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:18,712
(sighs)

214
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:20,247
(sighs)

215
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:23,950
Mr. Smithers! Come in, come in.

216
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:25,952
(chuckling): Oh! Well,
there's our tangle-foot!

217
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:27,320
Already on the mend.

218
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:28,622
Yeah, right.

219
00:08:28,657 --> 00:08:29,923
They say it'll be three months

220
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,925
before I can scratch my ass.

221
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,760
Six before I can really go at it.

222
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:35,829
Listen, I-I don't want
to take up your time.

223
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:38,064
I just need Homer's signature
on a couple of things.

224
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,967
First, a get well card to himself.

225
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:42,769
And what else does he need to sign?

226
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:44,070
Oh, a... (coughing)

227
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,305
...waiver of liability.

228
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,175
I know, I know.

229
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,843
There are solid reasons to sue.

230
00:08:49,878 --> 00:08:51,845
But do you really want to fill your life

231
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,282
with parasitic attorneys
with get-rich-quick schemes?

232
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:57,184
Schemes? Rich? Quick?

233
00:08:57,219 --> 00:08:59,252
Parasitic? Woo hoo!

234
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,988
How could I have forgotten to sue Mr.
Burns?

235
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:03,657
That's how you get rich in America.

236
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:06,026
Sue S. A! Sue S. A!

237
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:07,861
Oh, Lord.

238
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:10,464
Finally, a chance to use this.

239
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:14,634
It was designed ironically,
but I would die for it.

240
00:09:16,796 --> 00:09:18,654
Are you home during the day
because you were injured

241
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:22,529
at work, school, museum, church,
Iraq, elevator plummet,

242
00:09:22,554 --> 00:09:25,188
uneven sidewalk, hit by foul
ball, hit by fair ball,

243
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:27,290
or Iditarod viewing party?

244
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,093
The first one! The first one you said!

245
00:09:29,128 --> 00:09:30,728
Call me, Maxwell Flinch,

246
00:09:30,763 --> 00:09:34,498
at 555-555-5555.

247
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,267
Five, five, five...

248
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:38,402
Wait, what was the number
after the first three fives,

249
00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:40,170
but before the last six fives?

250
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:41,772
Uh, Simpson, before
you do anything rash,

251
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:44,642
Mr. Burns wanted you to
enjoy this get-well cake.

252
00:09:44,677 --> 00:09:46,744
- What's that writing on top?
- Oh!

253
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:49,313
It's just, uh, strawberry boilerplate

254
00:09:49,348 --> 00:09:50,781
absolving us of liability.

255
00:09:50,816 --> 00:09:52,750
Now just bite here, here, here,

256
00:09:52,785 --> 00:09:54,785
nibble here, lick here...

257
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,254
Uh, your wife needs to
eat this cupcake...

258
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,990
Sir, you cannot bribe me with cake.

259
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:03,360
Because I just ate several pies.

260
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:05,429
Hello, Mr. Smithers.

261
00:10:05,464 --> 00:10:06,830
I see you haven't given up.

262
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:08,532
(sighing)

263
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,035
Just enjoy the cake. As
long as you don't eat it

264
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,037
in front of a notary
public, you're fine.

265
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:14,471
I'm a notary public.

266
00:10:14,507 --> 00:10:17,207
You gave your ink pad to Maggie.

267
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:22,313
- (moans)
- I'll, um, I'll walk out with you.

268
00:10:22,348 --> 00:10:24,114
Don't go yet. You guys can help me

269
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,383
brainstorm a pattern for my new quilt.

270
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:28,719
Marge, I mean this in the nicest way:

271
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:32,022
your idea of fun makes me
want to blow my brains out.

272
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:33,190
(murmurs disappointedly)

273
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,461
Oh, Razzmatazz is perfect, Marge.

274
00:10:37,496 --> 00:10:39,129
It's-it's uh-- it's red,

275
00:10:39,165 --> 00:10:41,165
but not, uh, too red.

276
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,299
You're right!

277
00:10:42,335 --> 00:10:43,734
Why don't you stick around

278
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,836
and we'll discuss stitching
patterns over tea?

279
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:47,204
I'd like that.

280
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:49,006
And I'll take the cake back to the home

281
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,641
and share it with the seniors.

282
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:51,642
Typical.

283
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:52,876
I'll keep Dad company.

284
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:54,211
Thank you, Bart.

285
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:56,847
GRAMPA (moaning): Oh, I dropped it.

286
00:10:56,882 --> 00:10:59,550
Hey, wha-what did you put down my back?

287
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:00,718
Could be a tarantula,

288
00:11:00,753 --> 00:11:01,919
could just be some yarn.

289
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,087
I'll be at Milhouse's.

290
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:04,755
(whining fearfully)

291
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:09,193
(sighing)

292
00:11:11,097 --> 00:11:13,163
What the hell?

293
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:15,833
Oh, it's such a pleasure
to pour tea for someone

294
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:17,835
and not have to help him chew it.

295
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,503
We've made our choices.

296
00:11:19,538 --> 00:11:21,572
And the world doesn't understand them,

297
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:23,073
but we do.

298
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:26,577
Oh! Ew...

299
00:11:26,612 --> 00:11:28,545
Oh... Aw...

300
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:31,682
You know Marge, somehow I feel that

301
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:33,250
more than anyone, you understand

302
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:36,053
those horrible words,
"What do you see in him?"

303
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:37,388
I never said this,

304
00:11:37,423 --> 00:11:40,391
but did you ever think
we cling to these guys

305
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:43,427
because we're afraid to
admit we were wrong?

306
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:45,262
Do you really think that?

307
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:47,931
Well, I've tried to use
it constructively.

308
00:11:49,969 --> 00:11:51,568
I try to have "the serenity

309
00:11:51,604 --> 00:11:53,370
"to accept the things I cannot change

310
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:55,539
and the courage to change
the things I can."

311
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:56,774
HOMER: That's what they said to me

312
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:59,076
at that Alcoholics Unanimous meeting!

313
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:00,411
(groans)

314
00:12:00,446 --> 00:12:01,745
LISA: <i>Attention, bus riders!</i>

315
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:04,281
My new seating plan avoids conflict

316
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:07,151
through the use of complex
social algorithms.

317
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,620
It teams up compatible seatmates

318
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:11,889
and places Milhouse with no one.

319
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:14,792
Yet somehow, I'm still a little scared.

320
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:16,960
Otto, why are you sitting in back?

321
00:12:16,996 --> 00:12:18,962
Waiting for my assignment, chief.

322
00:12:18,998 --> 00:12:20,964
The driver's seat. You're the driver.

323
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,232
Still me?

324
00:12:22,268 --> 00:12:24,802
(scoffs) New management, same mistakes.

325
00:12:27,173 --> 00:12:30,441
It's so quiet. I've never been
able to hear my music before.

326
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:32,643
(rock music plays over headphones)

327
00:12:32,678 --> 00:12:34,478
Ooh, it sucks.

328
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,481
LISA: <i>This is just the beginning.</i>

329
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:38,982
<i>Soon I'll have control over</i>

330
00:12:39,018 --> 00:12:40,951
<i>every aspect of their lives.</i>

331
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:45,322
<i>And then I'll make them achieve
their un-dreamt dreams.</i>

332
00:12:45,357 --> 00:12:47,624
Sherri next to Terri.

333
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,126
Jimbo next to Dolph.

334
00:12:49,161 --> 00:12:50,694
No one next to Milhouse.

335
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,529
Ralph next to his invisible friend.

336
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:54,031
Kearney next to Nelson.

337
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,799
Martin next to Wendell.

338
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:57,734
Cosine next to Database.

339
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,138
(gasps)

340
00:13:01,173 --> 00:13:03,407
My first PG-13 fantasy.

341
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:05,442
Since we haven't been
able to get a settlement,

342
00:13:05,478 --> 00:13:07,878
we'll have to start preparing
you for your deposition.

343
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,681
Caroline here will stand in
for the opposing attorney.

344
00:13:10,716 --> 00:13:12,449
Good afternoon, Mr. Burns.

345
00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:14,818
Release the hounds.

346
00:13:14,854 --> 00:13:18,121
Uh, sir, you should try to
project a friendlier demeanor.

347
00:13:18,157 --> 00:13:20,123
Release the hounds.

348
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,458
Please.

349
00:13:21,494 --> 00:13:23,460
Seriously, sir, it would really be wise

350
00:13:23,496 --> 00:13:25,028
not to mention the hounds.

351
00:13:25,064 --> 00:13:26,864
Oh, that's like telling
Three-Finger Brown

352
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:28,966
he can't play for the Brooklyn Tip-Tops.

353
00:13:29,001 --> 00:13:30,067
(groans)

354
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:31,401
MARGE: <i>Waylon,</i>

355
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:32,469
now I can see why

356
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:35,506
so many women in movies
have gay friends.

357
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,509
Like Princess Leia and C-3PO.

358
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:40,844
Listen, I made this for you.

359
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,379
(gasps) Oh, my God.

360
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:45,048
