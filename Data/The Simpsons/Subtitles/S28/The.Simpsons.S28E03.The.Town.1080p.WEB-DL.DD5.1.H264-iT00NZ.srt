00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,668
Announcer:
You're watching The Simpsons.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,604
You know your life sucks.
Just get drunk
like you always do.

3
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:07,039
Catch all-new episodes Sundays,

4
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,475
And check out our other Fox
programs, Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

5
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:11,610
Bob's Burgers <i>and</i> Family Guy.

6
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:14,513
What is this,
and how can I make the rest
of my life about it?

7
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,748
Only on Fox.

8
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,157
Homer:
Come on, Marge, where's dinner?

9
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:26,525
What's the holdup
in there?

10
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,028
(to "charge" fanfare):
♪ pot-pop-pot-pot pot pies!

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,362
A pie for Bart...

12
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,797
Come on,
put them down already.

13
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:33,065
...A veggie pie
for Lisa...

14
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,800
Why do you have
to describe everything?

15
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:36,201
...A baby pie for Maggie.

16
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,970
The pies know
who they're for.

17
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:39,805
A dog pie for
Santa's Little Helper.
What? The dog...

18
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:41,073
The dog before me?

19
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:43,075
Now, be sure to
cut it open first

20
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:44,977
So the pie has time to cool.

21
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:46,412
(screams) I'm done.

22
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:49,415
I know you're in a hurry to go
to the bar to watch football,

23
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:52,151
But first I want you
to put the kids to bed.

24
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:53,185
(groans loudly)

25
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:54,553
(strains, grunts)

26
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,389
"everything after the tornado
was a dream. The end."

27
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,325
(tires screech)

28
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:01,693
Announcer:
Going into halftime,

29
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,530
It's Springfield Atoms 7,
Boston Americans 10.

30
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:07,399
Oh, come on,
we cannot lose again

31
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,235
To those no-good
Boston cheaters!

32
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,671
I-I can't stand that
pretty-boy quarterback.

33
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,339
Thinks he's so handsome,

34
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,408
Just 'cause he's
drop-dead gorgeous.

35
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,044
The only Boston wins
is because they cheat!

36
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:21,080
Listening in
on our teams' headsets,

37
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,247
Fattening our cheerleaders.

38
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,916
You know,
for three games last year,

39
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:26,051
Boston used a volleyball
painted brown.

40
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:28,020
(Boston accent):
That was never proven,

41
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:30,222
You Springfield screw-job.

42
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,790
Ugh, Boston fans.

43
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,626
In town for the
Dennis Lehane book tour.

44
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,896
Go kiss a Kennedy, you rule-
breaking cranberry squeezers!

45
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,231
We don't cheat.

46
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,200
We won 12 division
titles in ten years,

47
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:42,701
Fair and square.

48
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:46,438
You dorks are just jealous
of all our championship rings.

49
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,141
All:
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

50
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,542
You're the one
who's jealous.

51
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:53,112
I only wish I could be
as jealous as you.

52
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:54,613
Geez, Jay, this place has got

53
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,281
More knobs
than a hardware store.

54
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,417
I hate this town.

55
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:00,586
So don't I.
Friggin' doorknobs.

56
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:02,387
(laughter)
automatic.

57
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,156
Both:
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

58
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,291
Announcer:
It's fourth and long,

59
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,626
The Americans' last chance

60
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,760
For a miracle.

61
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,929
Come on, Springfield,
put it away!

62
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,132
We're gonna win one.
We're finally gonna win one!

63
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,134
Announcer: The QB handsomely
takes the snap,

64
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,635
Sexily steps back to pass,

65
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,904
And with God-given good looks,
fires it down field!

66
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:20,472
But there's no one there
to receive it!

67
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,406
(groaning)

68
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,175
(scoffs)
nice pass.

69
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:26,245
What a first-ballot
hall-of-fame loser.

70
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,280
Announcer: But the ball is
caught by the down field mascot,

71
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,748
Flappy the Flag!

72
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,517
Flappy running unopposed
into the end zone

73
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,253
For a surely illegal touchdown.

74
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,155
Throwing to the mascot?

75
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:39,958
After further review,
Flappy the Flag is listed

76
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,795
On the Flappy 53-man roster
and reported eligible.

77
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,597
The result of the play
is a touchdown.

78
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,665
(crowd cheering)

79
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,866
Announcer:
Once again, the Americans

80
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,101
Found a way to win.

81
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:50,802
(chuckles)
oh, that'll put a smile

82
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,104
On Coach Bonderchuck's face.

83
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:54,806
(crowd cheering)

84
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,808
(cheering)
oh, not again!

85
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,211
They cheated! You cheated!

86
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:01,547
Did not. You got to
cover the mascot.

87
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,382
Use your noggin. Play smart.

88
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,150
Flappy's on the roster.

89
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,019
(chanting):
On the roster!

90
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:10,522
On the roster!
On the roster!

91
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,391
On the roster, my butt.

92
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,693
Once again,
those Boston cheaters

93
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,695
Think the rules
don't apply to them.

94
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,997
And they're so smug
about winning.

95
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,700
If I ever won anything,
I wouldn't be smug about it.

96
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,869
I'd be class
all the way,

97
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:27,072
Like Mark Harmon--
pure American elegance.

98
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:30,008
I tell ya, the next
Boston fan I see,

99
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,343
I'm just gonna lose it.

100
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:33,045
Lose it so hard.

101
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,413
And... What the...

102
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,182
What is... How could...

103
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,985
That hat! Your head!

104
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,153
That team.

105
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:43,055
My son!

106
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,023
Hey, Dad, caught
the game last night.

107
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,391
Tough loss
for your guys.

108
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,060
Guess we just
wanted it more.

109
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,195
(sarcastically):
Oh, am I in the right house?

110
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:51,897
Because no one
in my house

111
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:56,668
Would ever be caught <i>dead</i>
<i>wearing Boston Americans gear.</i>

112
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,237
Dead!

113
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,504
I feel ya, Homer.

114
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,006
Sucks to be a loser.

115
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:03,375
Unlike the six-time
Mega-Bowl champion

116
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:04,876
Boston Americans.

117
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,411
Mwah! (smooches)

118
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,946
Ring, ring, ring.

119
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,181
(frustrated grunts)

120
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:10,415
Give me that hat.

121
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,285
(growls)

122
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,254
(grunting, snorting)

123
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,123
Olé!

124
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:22,461
(sighs) your Father never
could resist an "olé."

125
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,229
Eh, he'll run out
of steam soon.

126
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,999
(Homer groaning)

127
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:31,036
(laughter)

128
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,271
Get in.

129
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,139
(Milhouse and Nelson scream)

130
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:35,307
(gulps)

131
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,075
Look around, son.

132
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,744
This is your hometown.

133
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:41,880
And the Springfield Atoms
are your hometown team--

134
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:44,116
Since 2003, when we stole them

135
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,218
In the middle of the night
from Portland.

136
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,253
What kind of life
can you have here

137
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,988
As a Boston fan?

138
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,123
See?

139
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,458
Why are you wearing
that Boston hat?

140
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,427
This is
Atoms country, bro!

141
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:59,431
I would pluck out my own eyes
if I did not have a call-back

142
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:02,701
For a web-only
Olive Garden commercial.

143
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,439
They're just trying
to hat shame me.

144
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:10,742
Face it, Dad, Boston is
the Bart Simpson of cities.

145
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,744
All those awesome Southies
in   <i>The Departed,</i>

146
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,479
(chuckles)
those are my people.

147
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,983
People? The dog and the
baby are your people.

148
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:21,119
(sighs) it all goes back
to the Boston Tea Party,

149
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,822
A prank so kick-ass
it started a country.

150
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,023
(tires screech)

151
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,958
Come on, pal, what do you say?

152
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,329
Just lose the hat,
for your old man.

153
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,566
Nope, I think I'll stick
with the bad boys.

154
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:40,005
Get it off before God sees.

155
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,941
(whimpering)

156
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,176
(groans):
Oh!

157
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,449
And the people from Boston
are so obnoxious.

158
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:53,452
They think their stupid city
has the best everything:

159
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,854
Bands, comedians, chowder,

160
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,724
Their so-called cream pies,
which are actually cakes.

161
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:00,325
And there's...
Why don't you let me

162
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,961
Take your mind off
your problems?

163
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,629
And what's
with Aerosmith?

164
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,365
That's not how
you spell "arrow."

165
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:07,666
The... Oh.

166
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,369
(both moaning)

167
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,603
(confused grunting)

168
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,707
(whimpering)

169
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,346
Do your job, Homer.

170
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,215
(Homer screams)

171
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,684
Bart, you're my son.

172
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,586
There's no neck
tattoo so crass,

173
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:30,155
No gender reassignment
too ambiguous

174
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,590
That I would not love you.

175
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:34,659
Which is why I must show you
the error of your ways,

176
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:38,930
Even if it means dragging
this family all the way to hell.

177
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,601
A vacation to Boston?

178
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,936
No, not a <i>vay-cation,</i>

179
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,538
A <i>hate-cation!</i>

180
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,541
Where you experience
the worst a place has to offer,

181
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,710
And then say, "told ya!"

182
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:55,247
Hate-watching, hate-voting
and now a hate-cation?

183
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,016
Why can't everyone just
enjoy things they like?

184
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,051
Because things you like
don't fill you

185
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:02,921
With delicious,
delicious rage.

186
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,256
Hmm, I'm gonna
love this trip.

187
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,191
I'm gonna love it
right in your face.

188
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:09,060
That's it,
build it up in your head.

189
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:12,030
High hopes just make
the hate-cation stronger.

190
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,031
You're crazy.

191
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,033
Boston can't
be that bad.

192
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,905
(horns honking)

193
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:23,108
I've never loved
hating anything so much!

194
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,076
Move your
garbage car!

195
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,180
I got to get to the packy
before the B's drop puck!

196
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,282
Told ya!

197
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,293
See, boy? Notice how Bostonians
aren't exactly ugly,

198
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,628
But they're not
sexy either.

199
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,132
Homer, your negative attitude
is ruining this hate-cation.

200
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,167
So, what to hate first?

201
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,235
The Freedom Trail?

202
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:52,170
The Touch Tank
at the New England Aquarium?

203
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,605
Ooh, that could blow.

204
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,173
I want to go to Southie.

205
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:58,610
That part of town has the
towniest townies of any town.

206
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,979
(scoffs) you think your
Bostonians are so great?

207
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,348
Watch as your
beloved hooligans

208
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,951
Tear your innocent Father
limb from limb

209
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:08,653
With just
the slightest provocation.

210
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,358
Listen up, you clam-gargling
tea-tossers!

211
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,595
Fenway is a terrible ballpark!

212
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,096
Dad, don't!

213
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,031
Out of my way, ladies.
You're blocking my shot.

214
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:23,034
The seats at Fenway Park
are too narrow,

215
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:26,171
And many of them
face center field!

216
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:30,509
It's not charming,
it's a tear down!

217
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:31,710
(Boston accent):
The bobble heads!

218
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:32,944
They're tippin'!

219
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,613
(Boston accent):
Kid, mind the cart!

220
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,014
The what?
The cart!

221
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,983
The cot?

222
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,217
Cot!

223
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,054
(grunting)

224
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,189
No, don't struggle!

225
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,057
It only makes them
bobble harder.

226
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,159
They keep coming.
Bobble head Steven Wright,

227
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:51,997
Bobble head Aimee Mann,
bobble head Bell Biv Devoe!

228
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,999
The vibrations are killing him!

229
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,200
Don't worry, sweetheart,

230
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,668
I'm a doctor.

231
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,470
I'm also a doctor, kid.

232
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,672
(groaning)

233
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,974
Mm, so many doctors.

234
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,477
He's got a Pedro
lodged in his airway.

235
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,745
(homer gasps)

236
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,179
He'll be fine, ma'am.

237
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:11,049
And because of our state's
super-socialized health care,

238
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,219
No matter how much your husband
abuses his body,

239
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,254
Someone else will pay for it.

240
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,924
What a relief for women
with hot-tempered,

241
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:20,892
Accident-prone husbands.

242
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,928
Oh, yeah, we got
a whole surgical center

243
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,931
For injuries from falling off
icy roofs and gutters.

244
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,599
Both:
Ooh.

245
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,371
While the doctors pull tiny
Bruins helmets out of your skin,

246
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,274
Lisa and I are going to
explore the hub on our own.

247
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,577
Remember, this is
a hate-cation.

248
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,078
You better go
someplace bad.

249
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,614
Isn't Mayor Quimby from
somewhere around here?

250
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,285
(all muttering
with thick accents)

251
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,090
People are so fit here.

252
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,193
Everyone looks like they're
in a financial services ad.

253
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:58,697
Free sunscreen?
So progressive.

254
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,732
Do you vaccinate
your children?

255
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:01,866
Of course.

256
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,736
But not <i>stupid</i>
<i>progressive.</i>

257
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:07,639
(low buzzing)
what's that buzzing noise?

258
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:10,575
(gasps)
it's-it's nerds!

259
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:14,546
They've got every
recognized species of nerd!

260
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:15,947
A jester-hatted
ferret preener!

261
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,749
A wild west-afarian!

262
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,584
A  <i>magic: The gathering</i>
<i>gathering!</i>

263
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,885
Oculus rifters!

264
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,121
Yo-yo guys.
Yo-yo girls!

265
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,423
A chain mail ping pong player.

266
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,725
(giggles, squeals)

267
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,627
So much education.

268
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,662
If they did
a  <i>real housewives</i>here,

269
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,764
It would be a total snooze.

270
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,899
Ah, it's like
heaven for people

271
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,968
Who don't believe
in heaven.

272
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,137
Homer:
<i>What the crap is this BS?</i>

273
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,073
What? I thought you'd want
to try candle pin bowling.

274
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,845
Hey, McCarthy,
nice half-Worcester.

275
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,680
Get bent, McDonald.

276
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,649
A lot of wood
to work with out there.

277
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,150
(sputters)
Boston.

278
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,452
They even found a way
to mess up bowling.

279
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,654
Just try it.

280
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,855
(groans)

281
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,556
Eh, all right.

282
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,027
(grunts)

283
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,097
None of the usual pain
in my knees, back,

284
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,366
Wrist, shoulder,
neck, and chest.

285
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,504
(grunts)

286
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,341

one pin standing.

00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,842
Story of my life.

288
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,344
Whoa there, pal.

289
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,379
Don't forget
your third ball.

290
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,647
Hold on, wait.

291
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,182
Wait. Hold on.

292
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,250
Wait.

293
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,519
What?

294
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,654
This is candle pin bowling.

295
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:30,955
You get three.

296
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,224
Hmm? Hmm.

297
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,726
(grunts)

298
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,167
(gasps)
three balls.

299
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:45,036
I see it all so clearly now.

300
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,905
What, dad? What is it?

301
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,708
This regional bowling
with its one extra roll

302
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,511
Has knocked my misguided hate
into the gutter.

303
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:54,512
Mwah!

304
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:57,182
I like Boston!

305
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,984
Dad, you and me are real
father-son Southies, now.

306
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,920
Just like Ben and Casey Affleck.

307
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:05,724
Son, show me everything

Not Bart, but go on.

324
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:44,295
I never dared dream
about living somewhere

325
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:47,532
That values education,
with great health care,

326
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,234
And everyone's outdoorsy

327
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,401
But still pallid.

328
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,736
If it weren't crazy,

329
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,239
I'd say we should be
raising our kids here.

330
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,207
But no. No, no. That's crazy!

331
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,042
Is it?

332
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:01,146
(gasps) but I never thought
you, of all people...

333
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:04,249
Honey, this could be the chance
we never thought we'd get.

334
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:07,986
The chance to knock down
all of life's pins.

335
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,989
Are you saying what I think
you're saying?

336
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:15,660
I am. Fate is offering us
a third ball.

337
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,329
Do you mean it?
Are we going to move to Boston?

338
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:21,933

to live in a city

355
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,229
With a symphony and a pops?

356
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:25,563
(laughing):
Don't worry, baby.

357
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:29,200
I have a line on a sweet
safety inspector gig.

358
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,102
Very sweet.

359
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,648
Homer:
Can I get a test on batch six?

360
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,185
I'm finally living my dream

361
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,888
Of never not being around
batches of candy.

362
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,389
And unlike the nuclear plant,

363
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,859
If I screw up, no one gets hurt.

364
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:55,927
(screaming)

365
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,864
Are you sure we have
to go to school here?

366
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,766
I sort of thought I'd go
straight to running numbers

367
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,067
For the Irish mob.

368
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,069
Our school is in the heart
of what they once called

369
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,237
The combat zone.

370
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,039
The combat zone! Yes!

371
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,374
Combat rules!

372
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,042
Bart:
Charter what?

373
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:13,144
Here's my classroom.

374
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,581
The teacher is
Doris Kearns Goodwin.

375
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,919
Today, we explore Lincoln's 1861
suspension of habeas corpus,

376
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,755
Using dried macaroni
and pipe cleaners.

377
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,089
(gasps excitedly)

378
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,359
Huh, now to get sent
to detention.

379
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,528
That's where I'll meet
my future bank-robbing crew.

380
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,068
(all gasping)

381
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,103
Ha! How do you like
them marbles?

382
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,739
Bart, we have a place
for kids like you.

383
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,007
Bring it on.

384
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:47,145
(choir humming
"I'm shipping up to Boston")

385
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,147
Bart:
Kids singing?

386
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,215
(humming continues)

387
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,553
What the hell?

388
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:59,057
Like you, these kids are gifted
with exceptional energy.

389
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,426
Which they've channeled
into a cappella.

390
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,328
♪ I'm shipping up to Boston

391
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,462
♪ whoa!

392
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,663
(softly):
<i>Departed.</i>

393
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:06,998
These are the bad kids?

394
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
There's not a Wahlberg
in the bunch.

395
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:11,336
I've never felt
more like I fit in.

396
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,938
People think Boston’s all
Southies and hooligans.

397
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,441
But it's really teachers,
PH.D. Students,

398
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,643
Doctors, innovators,
philanthropists.

399
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,945
It's like living in
a giant classroom.

400
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,847
And every day
is a new test.

401
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,749
(groaning)

402
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,317
(thunder claps)

403
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,989
Theater?

404
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,191
Colleges?

405
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,226
Culture?

406
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:38,963
Oh, Pauly,

407
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:39,964
If you could have known that

408
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,766
Boston was gonna turn out
so wussy,

409
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:44,002
You never would have
warned anybody.

410
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,605
Listen, my brother,
and you shall see,

411
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:50,975
This is a town not for you,
but for me.

412
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,443
(screaming)

413
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,446
Hey, but what about Gram-pa?

414
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,448
He lives a thousand
miles away.

415
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,616
Great point.

416
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,184
Nobody tell him where we went.

417
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,220
Bart, you haven't touched
your clambake.

418
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,454
What's wrong?

419
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:06,724
This place is all P.C.
Brainiacs and Subaru owners

420
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,192
Wearing fleece vests.

421
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,128
It's nothing at all
like <i>The Departed.</i>

422
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,663
Oh, honey, I know
it's a big change.

423
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:16,367
But someday you'll understand
that providing our family

424
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,802
With a better life...

425
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:20,038
Something I've never
been able to do.

426
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,874
...Is the most important thing
in the world.

427
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,043
We've been given
a third ball.

428
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,311
Let's not throw it away.

429
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,514
(groans)

430
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:30,915
Same to you.

431
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,084
No one likes feeling
out of place.

432
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,253
That's how I felt
back in Springfield.

433
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,588
But I sucked it up
for eight years.

434
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,657
Now it's your turn.

435
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,100
(grunts)

436
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,168
(gasps)

437
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,537
Yes! Finally.

438
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:55,206
A Southie crew pulling a job.

439
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,408
I finally took that
spin class with Miranda.

440
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,377
I was sweatin'
so friggin' hard.

441
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,412
Hey, try
this pressed juice, kid.

442
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,015
Ginger, cayenne...
Wicked cleanse, pal.

443
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:05,716
Come on. Donny, Tommy,

444
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,685
These solar laptops for Rwandans

445
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:10,088
Ain't gonna donate themselves.

446
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,991
It's time for me to ship
out of Boston.

447
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,928
What a gorgeous day.

448
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,696
I hope it never ends.

449
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,965
So don't I.

450
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:24,068
You know, guys, I've picked out
the perfect Boston activity

451
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,736
To help celebrate our move.

452
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:26,737
(marching band playing)

453
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:27,772
Ooh, a parade.

454
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,340
Not just any parade.

455
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,276
Homer:
The Boston Americans?

456
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,114
Crowd (chanting):
Bonk! Bonk! Bonk!

457
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,083
It's a state holiday
because the league

458
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:40,918
Overturned the coach's
suspension

459
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,221
For using magnets
to affect the coin toss.

460
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:45,089
Pretty cool way to celebrate
our new hometown.

461
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,591
Right, dad?

462
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:51,329
(forced): As a Bostonian,
I definitely support my team.

463
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,967
Hey, Bonk!
Can we get a picture?

464
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,069
Hell to the derrr, little bro!

465
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,137
(grunting)

466
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,406
Come on, Homer, put on the hat.

467
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,276
I can support my hometown team
without putting on a hat.

468
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:08,146
Hats go on your head!

469
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:11,048
If you're gonna live in Boston,
you got to wear the hat.

470
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,618
(winces)

471
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,819
Okay.

472
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,154
(grunting, blowing)

473
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,093
You did this on purpose.

474
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:24,095
My future is at stake.

475
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:26,197
So don't is mine.

476
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:29,333
(struggling):
Just... A... Hat.

477
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,668
You can do it, Homie.

478
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,136
Think of the candle pins.

479
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:34,672
This is our extra ball!

480
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:38,176
A... Better... Life.

481
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,477
(yells)

482
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,679
(all gasping)

483
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,483
(quacking)

484
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,051
Derrr!

485
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,120
Stupid cheaters!

486
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:50,221
You cheat,

487
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,356
You flip out when people
say you cheat,

488
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,558
And everybody knows

489
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,127
You're nothing but a big bunch
of cheaters!

490
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:59,130
(chuckling)

491
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,898
You made us leave
that lovely city

492
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,067
Rather than just
put on a stupid hat.

493
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,535
It wasn't even fitted.

494
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,238
(sighs)
I just couldn't wear the hat.

495
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,006
Well, I'm still mad at you.

496
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,976
I never even got to experience
one of those Boston winters

497
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,477
Everyone raves about.

498
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:16,047
Come on, baby, we could
never escape our problems

499
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,748
By moving somewhere else.

500
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,052
Our problems are <i>who</i> we
are, not where we are.

501
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,987
Well... Maybe.

502
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:25,089
The traffic was
pretty annoying.

503
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,491
Not to mention
the unspoken racism.

504
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:30,161
It wasn't that unspoken.

505
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,897
At least someone
in this family

506
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,765
Is happy about
where they came from.

507
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,069
Oh, don't worry, Lisa.

508
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,037
You'll get back
to Boston someday.

509
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,906
What are you
talking about?

510
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,207
I never left.

511
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,509
I'm in Boston now.

512
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,013
Welcome home, Lisa.

513
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:50,681
Class is about to start.

514
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:52,650

515
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:54,685
