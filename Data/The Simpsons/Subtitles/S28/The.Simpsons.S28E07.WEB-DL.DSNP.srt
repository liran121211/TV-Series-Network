Kirk, when I started digging for oil,

I came up dry for 12 years.

33
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,200
Then I had my yee-haw moment

00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,245

35
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,539

Of course you don't know.
You're just a kid.

Dad, it's not fair to blame the dog.

Blame the dumb animal

53
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,914
I did walk him. Didn't I, boy?

of every branch of the service.

and for a lot less.

119

How much less?

120
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,645

costs six bucks there.

No. We're not.

139
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,272
And we'll have fun when we get there.

140
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,399
We can have plantains.

141
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,235
They're like bananas you have to cook.
Yum.

142
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,030

are too hard for me to chew.

Despite what she says,
this trip will be fun.

147
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,335
I am finally gonna put the Spanish

148
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,755
(à la Ricky Ricardo) Oh, Loo-sey,
you need to see a "fee-sa-kia-trist."

149
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,256
Excuse me, sir.

150
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,842
We are perfectly able
to pronounce "psychiatrist."

151
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,886
Now, please don't make me
'splain it to you again.

152
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,180
Come on, Rick.
The girls are dressed up like men,

153
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,224
trying to get into the cigar store.

154
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,142
So you know what we do, Fred?

155
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,020
We give them cigars. (laughs)

156
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,980
All the cigars they want.

157
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,149
(laughs) This will be good.

158
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,069
I'll never understand why a bandleader

159
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,822
was such good friends with his landlord.

160
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,573
(Cuban music playing)

161
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,164
Now, there are 12 types of visits to Cuba

162
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,582
that are legally permitted.

163
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,042
-U.S. business...
-Next.

164
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,377
...professional research...

165
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,711
I don't know what
either of those words mean.

166
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,339
-...educational activities...
-Those words I know and hate.

167
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,008
-...family visit...
-Is there a VIP entrance to this place?

168
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,302
-...religious activities...
-(laughing) God, no.

169
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,346
-...public performances...
-Never.

170
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,932
-...mistook us for Aruba...
-Is that that weird lettuce?

171
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,226
-...here to smuggle cigars...
-You guys have cigars?

172
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,437
-...fell off a fishing boat...
-Many times, not today.

173
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,814
-...transmission of information...
-Who wants to know?

174
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,692
-...really love Gloria Estefan...
-Getting warmer.

175
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,403
...and the last one
is journalistic activity.

176
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,739
I'm a journalist.
I'm doing an article for my school paper.

177

00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,340
Oh, what kind of father
would you be if you left me now?

351
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,009
Son, all you see in me is a burden!

352
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,265

you don't visit someone!

(chuckles)

365
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,719
I'd like to speak to
your black ops department.

366
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,472
-Right downstairs, Mr. Simpson.
-Thank you.

367
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,724
Hmm. How did they know my name?

368
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,850
(whirring)

369
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,978
(whistling a tune)

370
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,688
I don't know where my dad is.

371
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,815
Don't worry-- each AARP card

372
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,650
contains a secret tracking chip.

373
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,735
(laughs)
The magazine is pretty good, too.

374
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,904
-Super easy Sudoku.
-Quiet!

375
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,406
This could take a while.

376
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,741
Bam! Got 'em!

377
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,035
Now you have to do a favor for us.

378
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,705
How many baseball players
can you sneak home with you?

379
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,708
Well... I have to ask my wife,
but I'd say 12.

380
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,042
Bam! Done!

381
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,213
Andre here sold secrets to the Soviets.

382
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,007
And this is the guy

383
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,093
who came up with the service fee
for Ticketmaster.

384
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,386
(grunts)

385
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,471
Do you know any good people?

386
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,974
Everyone's got their embarrassments, Abe.

387
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,476
-I'm sure you got yours.
-HOMER: Dad!

388
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,645
And up he walks.

389
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,314
What are you doing here?
Who are these people?

390
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,276
This guy was the biggest drug lord
in North American history.

391
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,778
And this guy invented Ticketmaster.

392
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,573
You charged me to sell me something!

393
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,199
Pleased to meet you, sir.

394
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,953
(whispers)
Abe, come with me to the cockpit.

395
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,747
Are we gonna fly or make love?

396
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,125
You will sit there, move nothing,
and do as I say.

397
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,127
Hot dog! Makin' love!

398
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,795
(grunts)

399
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,968
(American accent)
Miami, this is Jitterbug Justice

400
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,512
bringing back an early bird special.

401
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,307
-Miami, do you copy?
<i>-MAN (over radio): Uh, we copy.</i>

402
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,103
The nightclub is flying away.

403
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,397
Can't we hold on to anything?

404
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,485
GRAMPA: Boy, I didn't think
I'd ever be able to do this again!

405
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,945
All you have done is fly
without falling asleep.

406
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,031
Just like on my honeymoon.

407
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:58,118
I'm starting to suspect
you're not a simple Cuban bartender.

408
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,996
No, I'm an undercover agent
for the CIA

409
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,373
here to recapture fugitives
from U.S. law.

410
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,502
<i>And when I saw you,</i>
<i>I realized you'd be the perfect carcass</i>

411
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,337
<i>to tempt these old buzzards.</i>

412
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,797
(sputtering, stammering)

413
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,132
Is there anything I get out of this?

414
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,677
-Yes. You avoid the knockout gas.
-Aw.

415
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,472
-(gas hissing)
-(body thud)

416
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,265
Oh, thank God.

417
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,810
Usually I can never sleep on planes.

418
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,187
Sometimes I... (weak groaning)

419
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,438
(thuds)

420
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,779
(loud buzzing)

421
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,490
(flamingos honking)

422
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:40,369
So, that's the end of my Cuban paradise.

423
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:44,039
And like every good thing in my life,
I've already forgotten it.

424
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,376
Listen, Dad, I know it was fun,
but your place is with us,

425
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,920
not on some island in the Indian Ocean.

426
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,296
I love you.

427
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,799
(both sobbing)

428
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,179
Oh, now we're two men hugging.

429
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,349
This is no sight for the streets of Miami.

430
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,144
(both sobbing)

431
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,688
Hey, Dad. It's a beautiful day.

432
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,314
Want to hit the links?

433
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,984
Oh, just like we used to.

434
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,113
(horn blows)

435
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:19,158
-(laughter)
-Screw you!

436
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,079
(horn blows)

437
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,581
(horn blows)

438
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,999
Look over there.

439
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,378
I just painted a black circle
on the green.

440
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,921
MAN: Why, you little...

441
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,007
(laughter)

442
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,510
(laughter continues)

443
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,596
(grunting)

444
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,641
Now, boy, it's 50 cents a golf ball

445
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,101
from that water hazard.

446
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,687
Just move those logs aside.

447
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,777
