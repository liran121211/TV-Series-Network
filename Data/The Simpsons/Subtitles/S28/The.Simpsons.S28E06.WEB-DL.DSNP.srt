00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,300
<i>FOLKSY ANNOUNCER: Well,</i>
<i>it's the first Saturday in September,</i>

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,803

4

<i>Opening day of peewee football.</i>

00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,308
<i>ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):</i>
<i>And everybody's headed down</i>

7
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,686

8
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,229
<i>It all comes down to this,</i>

00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,647

<i>And drunks</i>

12
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:27,902
Ladies and gentlemen,

13
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,155
your Springfield Neutrinos!

14
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,490

Huh?

16
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:36,870
NELSON:
Where'd everybody go?

17
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:37,871
BART:
I can't see.

18
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,707
(gasps)
They over-fogged the run-in!

19
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,167
They put those kids in danger

20
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,793
just to psych up the crowd.

21
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,336
Yeah, are you psyched up now?

22
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,546
Huh? Are you?!

23
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,007
-(players panicking)
-(helmets clonking)

24
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,009
Concussions!

25
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,595
Concessions!

26
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,681
-(door dings)
-Aah!

27
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,266
(anxious chatter)

28
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,852
My boy hit his head doing football!

29
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,353
I'm a doctor's wife.

30
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,189
Save my boy first!

31
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,566
My boy needs an MRI!

32
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,567
-(clamoring)
-Ow!

33
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,861
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

34
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,822
With head injury concerns on the mind,

35
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,450
the town has shut down
its peewee football program.

36
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,868
Professor, what danger does this

37
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,870
concussion threat truly pose?

38
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:19,913
Uh, well, Kent,

39
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,956
these children will need their brains

40
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,959
unbruised for the demanding,
high-tech jobs

41
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:25,960
of the future:

42
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,380
polishing and buffing
our robot masters.

43
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,423
Indeed.

44
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,674
And here to defend youth football,

45
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,760
we have... Nelson's dad.

46
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:34,928
Are you wearing makeup?

47
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,971
Is it worth the risk
to your son's health

48
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,432
when only .1 percent
of youth football players

49
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,725
make it to the pros?

50
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,727
You saying my boy
doesn't have what it takes

51
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,229
to play pro ball? Huh?

52
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,772
Boy, show him your moves.

53
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:46,940
Juke it, juke it!

54
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,150
(grunting)

55
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,402
Why are you dekeing it
when I said juke it?

56
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,445
Take a lap!

57
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,613
-Without football, Kent,
-(Nelson groans)

58
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,824
how are kids gonna learn character
like I did,

59
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,325
you stupid fruit-munch?

60
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,702
And what is your problem, smart-nuts?

61
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,703
(grunts)

62
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,831
Which brings us to this question:

63
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:03,915
if not football,

64
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,376
what sport is safe for our children?

65
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,880
But there are so many club sports

66
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,841
that can eat up all our free time.

67
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,967
What about baseball?

68
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,260
(scoffs) Baseball--

69
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,636
rife with steroids!

70
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,096
Then test for steroids!

71
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,431
Oh, and then there'll be no home runs!

72
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,268
-(all arguing)
-Um, I think I-I may have a solution.

73
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,269
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

74
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,687
What about biathlon?

75
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,356
That teaches kids to ski and kill.

76
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,524
How about Frisbee-golf?

77
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,067
If I could just have your attention...

78
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,278
Hey, what about Filipino tooth-fighting?

79
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,281
It builds biting,
jaw strength and mouth work.

80
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,449
The champion for a long time was a dog.

81
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,618
(groans)
No one is listening to me.

82
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,953
Well, maybe no one wants to hear

83
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,288
your ridiculous idea.

84
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,540
Let's go.
We're late for prenatal yoga.

85
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,624
Milhouse is ten.

86
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,127
Why are we still doing that?

87
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,461
Poor Kirk.

88
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,796
No one listens to him.

89
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,132
Even Luann treats him like garbage.

90
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,134
(sighs)
Love's funny like that.

91
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,177
Help him out.

92
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,304
Make people listen to his idea.

93
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,513
Oh, why me?

94
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,973
I only came to this concert

95
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,808
because I was told it was a potluck.

96
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,809
(grunts)

97
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,812
(groans)

98
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,106
(arguing continues)

99
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,650
Attention, smothering parents

100
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,777
who only came to hear themselves talk!

101
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,654
-You're an idiot!
-(arguing quiets)

102
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,741
This guy has as much right to bore us

103
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,159
as any of you!

104
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,577
Take it away, buddy.

105
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,787
<i>(echoing)</i>
<i>Buddy, buddy, buddy...</i>

106
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,289
"Buddy." Huh.

107
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,875
Um, I've got an exciting sport

108
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,669
that's great exercise
a-and teaches teamwork.

109
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,670
Lacrosse.

110
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,380
-La-what?
-What-cross?

111
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,506
What-what?

112
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,507
Lacrosse.

113
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,762
It's the perfect combination
of America's two least-watched sports:

114
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,388
soccer and hockey.

115
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,515
(murmuring excitedly)

116
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,476
Any kid can learn to play lacrosse.

117
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,727
Even this.

118
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,479
(parents gasping)

119
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,190
This isn't a drive-in movie.

120
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,359
(parents gasping)

121
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,446
Everybody,

122
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,199
feel free to whip stuff at my son's face.

123
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,284
(laughter and indistinct chatter)

124
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,704
Yarr.

125
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,830
Now, hold on there.

126
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,874
Lacrosse has the second-highest
concussion rate,

127
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,042
right after football.

128
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,837
(chanting)
Safer than football!

129
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,839
Safer than football!

130
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,883
Hey, why don't we have this fruit-munch

131
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,010
teach our kids this crazy sport?

132
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,971
Me, coach your kids?

133
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,014
Most of you won't even make eye contact

134
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,267
when I'm weighing your yogurt.

135
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,893
I'll do it.

136
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,104
If Homer will coach with me.

137
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,105
Huh?

138
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,400
We've come too far together
on this crazy ride.

139
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,277
It wouldn't feel right
to do it without you...

140
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,278
buddy.

141
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,405
<i>(echoing)</i>
<i>Buddy, buddy, buddy...</i>

142
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,698
Mm?

143
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,867
Oh, fine,

144
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,577
I'll coach with this guy.

145
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,996
But I promise you this:

146
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,707
I will never stop complaining about it.

147
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,042
(cheering)

148
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,253
Stupid sport I never heard of...

149
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,880
make me wake up early on a Saturday...

150
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,590
probably have to slice oranges...

151
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,717
don't even know the rules

152
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,260
because I refuse to learn 'em...

153
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,470
my kids will probably suck at it...

154
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,639
and I'll have to kneel down
on photo day,

155
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,433
knees get all wet...

156
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,184
despite my bad attitude,

157
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,562
I'm thrilled by the nonstop action...

158
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,230
kids running towards me

159
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,691
with a look of joy
I've never seen before...

160
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,234
Dad, we won!

161
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,861
It's okay, kids.

162
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,447
What matters is you tried your best.

163
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,073
Have an orange slice.

164
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,616
No, we won!

165
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,910
Yes, we're all winners.

166
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,913
Because losing teaches valuable lessons.

167
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,623
Have an orange slice.

168
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,791
We did it, buddy.

169
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,918
You and I make a great team.

170
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,253
We won for real!

171
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,213
For the first time in our lives,

172
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,300
we can say "good game"
and actually mean it.

173
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,551
Good game!

174
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,969
Uh, good game!

175
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,055
Ha! That's loser talk!

176
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,188
(cheering)

177
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,232
(groaning)

178
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,361
Wow, pizza really does

179
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,904
taste sweeter after you win.

180
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,114
(humming happily)

181
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,115
Dude.

182
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,992
My kids have never won at anything.

183
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,202
All the girl does is read,

184
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,286
and the boy's got one of those

185
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,289
paying attention diseases
that isn't really a disease.

186
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,999
Awesome job, guys!

187
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,293
How do you know
so much about lacrosse?

188
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,837
Wait.
You want to know about me?

189
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,839
(disinterested mumbling)

190
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,841
Well, it all goes back
to my college days,

191
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:28,721
<i>where I was the star attackman</i>
<i>on our lacrosse team.</i>

192
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,764
(crowd cheering)

193
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,432
(marching band playing)

194
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,145
<i>I'd even been drafted to play in the pros</i>

195
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,939
<i>for the Milwaukee Zoom.</i>

196
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,525
<i>After scoring</i>
<i>the championship-winning goal,</i>

197
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,318
<i>I was on top of the world, man.</i>

198
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,362
<i>I was high-fiving everybody.</i>

199
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,197
<i>For the first time in my life,</i>

200
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,866
<i>no one, and I mean no one,</i>
<i>was leaving me hanging.</i>

201
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,034
<i>I was slap-happy,</i>

202
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,286
<i>I couldn't stop myself, until...</i>

203
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,374
<i>I highed one five too far.</i>

204
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,751
-(metallic clank)
-(wrist shattering)

205
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,463
<i>Our school mascot, Sir Gudge-a-lot.</i>

(retching)

207
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,802
<i>My Zoom dream died that day.</i>

208
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,220
Mm...

209
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,304
(grunts angrily)

210
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,558
Uh... Ah...

211
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,559
(metallic clicking)

212
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,353
My wrist healed, but my wrist in here...

213
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,729
never did.

214
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,607
I've never high-fived my own son.

215
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,734
The mascot wore a suit of armor?

216
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,902
Just like a knight!

217
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,530
Yeah, but now lacrosse
has brought us together.

218
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,824
Hey, a toast to new friendship!

219
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,577
Could I get a roll of toilet paper,
please?

220
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,079
I get nosebleeds when I drink.

221
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,999
To... new...

222
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,625
friendship.

223
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,253
Mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

(Maggie coos)

230
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,395
It's 6:00 a.m. on a Saturday.

231
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,772
We have a weekend lacrosse tournament!

232
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,357
-(horn honking outside)
-There's Coach K!

233
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,442
Come on, come on, come on!

Check out the travel van, brah!
(chuckles)

240
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,916
Two days, ten games,

241
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,169
700 miles and one sweet mixtape.

242
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,713
I hope you like
Big Bad Voodoo Daddy,

243
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,299

I'm pretty sure a mixtape

249
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,603
isn't just the same song
over and over again.

250
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,481
No, no, dude,
they're different live versions.

251
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,442
You can tell because some are longer.

252

-(music stops)
-Hey, you want a hit off my vape pen?

253

It tastes like passionfruit,

254
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,156
and people think you're a smoker.

255
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,616
Why would I want that?

256
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,327
(chuckling)
Don't worry. Marge isn't here.

257

Oh, speaking of which,

where is the craziest place

-What?
-Let's both say it at the same time.

-Don't!
-Chipotle!

Oh, they can't hear us.

264

you mean a strip club?

Yeah, Wiggles has great dancers,

301
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,889

303
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,310
Which, uh-- (chuckles) I do.

304
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,270
Why would I want to go to a strip club?

00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,105
I'm married to a naked lady.

306
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,609
Drive time to Sapphire Diamond

don't you, buddy?

Of course
I want to hang with you, buddy.

325
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,403
But, you know, I'm pretty tired
from all those YouTube videos

326
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,571
you showed me about whiskey making.

327
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,407
It gets its color from the barrel.

328
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,158
I know, the barrel.

I've never rented before.

538
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,789
Helmet up, kids.

539
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,667
Let's win ourselves a championship.

540
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,837
Who wants orange slices?

541
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,255
(cheering)

542
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,924
ALL: Yay!

543
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,511
No matter how bad our kids screw up
the rest of their lives,

544
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,847
they'll always have this moment.

545
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,350
Buddy, you deserve this.

546
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,517
(exclaims quietly)

547
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,019
-(bones cracking)
-(Homer and Kirk scream)

548
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,729
Just because we're in traction

549
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,523
doesn't mean this hospital room
can't swing.

550
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:37,903
<i>♪ So I think about my next drink ♪</i>

551
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,322
<i>♪ And it's you and me</i>
<i>and the bottle makes three tonight ♪</i>

552
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,448
(muffled groaning)

553
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,033
<i>♪ Yeah! ♪</i>

554
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,911
<i>♪ What do you mean it's last call? ♪</i>

555
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,215
Hey, guys, I know all you
"Crushin' It" fans

556
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:01,218
are super pumped
for my latest crush video.

557
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,387
Sorry, no contest winner this week.

558
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,055
Remember, to qualify,

559
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,058
you have to be a subscriber
<i>and</i> leave a comment.

560
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,936
Now, the secret to the ultimate
rice sammy

561
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,731
is to make sure the rice is really wet,
li-like soaking.

562
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,732
(high-pitched scrubbing)

563
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,276
(chews and slurps)

564
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,402
(high-pitched scrubbing)

565
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,363
So after going in to find it
a third time,

566
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,616
they just decided to leave
the colonoscopy camera inside...

567
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,617
(high-pitched scrubbing)

568
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,910
Five words:

569
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,204
jet fuel can't melt steel.

570
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,539
(high-pitched scrubbing)

571
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,207
When I held the door for that guy

572
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,835
and he didn't even say
thank you, I just lost it!

573
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:35,919
(high-pitched scrubbing)

574
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,339
Oh, man,
Milwaukee would've been so sweet.

575
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,591
The Zoom were the kings of that town!

576
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,801
(high-pitched scrubbing)

577
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,136
(snoring)

578
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,057
-(murmuring)
-Shh!

579
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,022
