00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:32,960
What a beautiful day
for a family stroll.

14
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,800
Tell that to my aching back!

15
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:40,420
It's not a family stroll...
Homer forgot where

16
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,460
he parked his car last night,
and now we have to find it.

17
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,248
What a beautiful day to be in denial.

18
00:01:45,283 --> 00:01:46,760
Yeah, Bart. Who cares?

19
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,900
The sun is shining, birds are singing...

20
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,720
people are staring up
at the sky in terror?

21
00:01:54,793 --> 00:01:56,620
Do you see it, Lisa?

22
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,345
There's... nothing... there.

23
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:02,298
And that's where Lard Lad used to be!

24
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, looks like we better file a report
with the Bureau of Missing Statues.

25
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,800
Yeah. Be like that time that
Rodin statue got stolen.

26
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,900
What was the name of
that statue again? Eh...

27
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,476
Ah, let me think. Um...

28
00:02:13,528 --> 00:02:14,694
Thinkin'.

29
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:16,396
Yeah, still thinkin'.

30
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:19,649
Still thinkin'.

31
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:23,152
Uh, either we can fan out and search,
or bunch up and riot.

32
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:26,322
Oh, balderdash and poppycock.
I say we do not riot.

33
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:28,791
- Riot!
- Don't!

34
00:02:28,827 --> 00:02:31,494
- Riot!
- Don't!

35
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,120
Riot!

36
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,940
And thanks to the equal
number of nonrioters,

37
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,847
the total cost of the
damage is zero dollars.

38
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:52,610
Homer, were you in that riot?

39
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,768
Marge, please.
I'm a leader in this community.

40
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,280
In response to the outcry,
Lard Lad's parent company,

41
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,992
Tianjin Mining and Smelting and Donuts,
has issued the following statement:

42
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:06,663
"We are rebranding Lard Lad
with an updated statue."

43
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,531
Ooh, rebranding.

44
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,550
That just means admitting failure, Dad.

45
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,752
Ooh, admitting failure.

46
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:16,172
People of Springfield, please welcome Mr....

47
00:03:16,207 --> 00:03:19,208
I know I'm gonna mangle this...
Lee Fong.

48
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:21,427
Uh, actually, it's
pronounced Robert Chan.

49
00:03:23,048 --> 00:03:26,766
And now, please welcome the model
for the original Lard Lad,

50
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:28,685
Mr. Laird Lad.

51
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,500
A lot of crazy names today.

52
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,191
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Lard Lad's bold,

53
00:03:35,226 --> 00:03:37,110
focus-grouped, new look!

54
00:03:41,783 --> 00:03:43,710
That doesn't say donuts!

55
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,069
That says management overthink!

56
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:49,030
The Thinker!
That statue's called The Thinker.

57
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:51,600
What? What are we on now? What?

58
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,711
People, let's give the
new statue a chance.

59
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:56,913
When the Eiffel Tower was first built,

60
00:03:56,998 --> 00:03:59,582
many said it was a steel monstrosity.

61
00:03:59,634 --> 00:04:01,301
It still is.

62
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:03,970
Fine, but maybe this will grow on you.

63
00:04:04,055 --> 00:04:07,130
Aw, this thing sucks. I don't think so.

64
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:09,926
- Well, at-at-at a certain angle... 
- It's beautiful.

65
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:11,560
- We love it.
- That's beautiful.

66
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:21,580
You fools! You've erected
a massive concave reflective surface.

67
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,440
It will focus the sun's
beam in a deadly ray.

68
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,660
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

69
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,050
- Uh.
- Oh. Hey!

70
00:04:58,109 --> 00:05:00,476
First off, I'd like
to thank the good people

71
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:04,397
at Tianjin Smelting and
Mining and Donuts and Tarps

72
00:05:04,482 --> 00:05:08,330
for neutralizing our wonderful,
deadly, new Lard Lad.

73
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,480
Yeah, that's great.

74
00:05:10,855 --> 00:05:12,221
They'll grow back.

75
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,092
The time for mourning and
blaming our mayor has passed.

76
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:18,044
We will rebuild.

77
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:20,463
We will rebuild.

78
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:22,548
We will rebuild.

79
00:05:22,634 --> 00:05:25,218
We will rebuild!

80
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:27,303
We will rebuild!

81
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:37,647
We will rebuild.

82
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:39,565
We will rebuild.

83
00:05:39,651 --> 00:05:42,500
I guess there's only one
man we can turn to.

84
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,160
Supergirl?!

85
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:49,909
So... you'd like me to save the town.

86
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:52,028
Well, you've got gumption,
I'll give you that.

87
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,580
And such an adorable baby,

88
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,700
it really restores my... my faith in...
in the, uh...

89
00:05:57,752 --> 00:06:00,870
Smithers, where is the
damn trapdoor button?

90
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:05,041
Mr. Burns, you already trap-doored us
from your upstairs office.

91
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,378
Yes. And how was your fall?
Painful? Unexpected?

92
00:06:09,464 --> 00:06:11,560
- Oh, yeah.
- Worst I've ever had.

93
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,715
- Oh! Really...
- Really...

94
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:15,301
- Pulled something.
- Totally painful. Did not see it coming.

95
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:16,950
Excellent.

96
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:21,974
So... remind me what I was saying no to.

97
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,393
Funding repairs to the town.

98
00:06:24,446 --> 00:06:27,196
But if you could do even
one little project.

99
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:29,031
Reducking the duck pond

100
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:31,234
or fixing up the Springfield Bowl.

101
00:06:31,286 --> 00:06:33,402
The Springfield Bowl.

102
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,912
Very well. I will rebuild this
town on one condition.

103
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:46,749
Forget it. Our desperate
plea is nonnegotiable.

104
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:49,085
I want to put on a variety
show at the Bowl.

105
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,921
A celebration of everything
wonderful about... um,

106
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:54,390
- what's the name of this town again?
- Springfield, sir.

107
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:57,426
Yes, I will destroy Springfield.

108
00:06:57,512 --> 00:07:00,790
- Celebrate, sir.
- Fine, we'll try it your way first.

109
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:05,144
Springfield has risen from
the ashes like a phoenix.

110
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:06,910
That's phoenix, the mythical bird,

111
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,570
not Phoenix, the cultureless,
Mars-scape of the Southwest.

112
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:15,370
Our unlikely angel the devil himself,
C. Montgomery Burns.

113
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,010
Thank you, Kent.

114
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,684
And don't forget the open auditions
for my Springfield Follies.

115
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:24,570
This year women may audition, too,

116
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:28,190
with permission of husband,
father and pastor in writing.

117
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,890
Next.

118
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:43,672
♪ Un bel di, vedremo ♪

119
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:50,710
♪ Levarsi un fil di fumo... ♪

120
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,560
Puccini's a little well-trod,
don't you think?

121
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:57,886
This isn't right. This isn't how it was at all.

122
00:07:57,972 --> 00:07:59,605
I remember that night so vividly.

123
00:08:04,061 --> 00:08:06,690
Monty, time to go on stage.

124
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,399
Yes, Mama. Your little
butterscotch drop won't let you down.

125
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:13,235
Aw, who's candy? You's candy.

126
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,154
Oh, I'm gonna lick you,
my sweet little lolly.

127
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,140
Who likes Mommy's licks?
Monty likes Mommy's licks.

128
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,040
Lickity, lickity, lick. Oh, oh, oh.

129
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,577
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

130
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:25,047
Oh. Oh, ho, ho.

131
00:08:25,082 --> 00:08:28,383
But the butterscotch soon
turned to bitter squelch.

132
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:30,636
I want everything just
as it was back then.

133
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:33,520
The stage filled with children
like those from 1913.

134
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:37,259
High-spirited, snaggletoothed,
and willing to work 18 hours a day.

135
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,930
Attention. An old man is prowling
the school, looking for young children.

136
00:08:41,982 --> 00:08:43,940
Please, perform for him.

137
00:08:44,234 --> 00:08:46,760
Watch me make this nerd disappear.

138
00:08:47,604 --> 00:08:50,489
Ta-da! Also, haw-haw!

139
00:08:50,574 --> 00:08:53,575
Excellent villain. And my cast is complete.

140
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,827
I'll just save the list and...

141
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:01,116
Samson himself could not
pry open these jaws.

142
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:02,720
Can I help you, sir?

143
00:09:02,753 --> 00:09:05,504
Oh, women aren't meant
for clasp opening.

144
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,520
Young lady, if there's one thing I know

145
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,544
about show business, it's that
there are a lot of clipboards.

146
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:15,047
How would you like to be
my assistant director?

147
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:16,515
Hmm.

148
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,300
And I'll be perfectly positioned

149
00:09:18,352 --> 00:09:21,553
to find out exactly what
Mr. Burns is really up to.

150
00:09:21,638 --> 00:09:26,191
I'm in. And if you need another act,
I also play this.

151
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:30,610
There's no room in my show for
Adolphe Sax's vile-sounding o-phone.

152
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,840
Do you ever say anything
in a simple way?

153
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,950
- Shut up.
- Well, that was clear.

154
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,489
Hey, Homer, are you sure we haven't
let the plant slip with Mr. Burns gone?

155
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:42,741
Smitty, as a wise, old man once said,

156
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:44,326
"Out with the old...

157
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:46,461
and in with the brew."

158
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,420
- That's enough.
- But I haven't started my act.

159
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,366
- Muntz, what have you got?
- A rabbit in a bag.

160
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:26,560
Ooh, a promising magic trick.

161
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,503
No, it's my lunch.

162
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:32,040
Bah! You're all incompetent.
I won't go through this a second time.

163
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:35,120
Second time? Is there
something you're not telling us?

164
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:40,215
A vast amount. And what part of 
"What I've never told you" don't you understand?

165
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,225
Mother, what is that
sound they're making?

166
00:10:50,277 --> 00:10:53,728
Well, it's called laughter.
You're a laughingstock, Charles.

167
00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:56,210
Oh, oh, it's awful.

168
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,652
This show isn't good enough.
No show could be good enough.

169
00:11:00,737 --> 00:11:02,404
It's not?

170
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,999
- What are you doing?
- Da-da-do-doo! Getting ready for Monday.

171
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:16,510
I'm gonna fill a Super
Soaker full of lemonade,

172
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,336
Carl's gonna fill one with iced tea,

173
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:21,900
and we're gonna Arnold Palmer
Lenny when he walks in.

174
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,395
Arnold Palmer Lenny.

175
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:30,460
You're going to Arnold Palmer Lenny.

176
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,330
Yeah, you see,
Arnold Palmer was a golfer

177
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,730
and he made up this drink

178
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,800
where it's not a full glass of lemonade

179
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,120
or a full glass of iced tea.

180
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,612
Instead...

181
00:11:43,697 --> 00:11:46,530
Homie, I'm worried about all
this silliness at work.

182
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,450
You're the safety inspector.

183
00:11:48,535 --> 00:11:50,952
I'm "A" safety inspector.

184
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:53,455
- Not "The".
- I've never seen another.

185
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,070
What... wait, one safety inspector?

186
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,927
For the whole nuclear plant?
That's insane.

187
00:12:00,514 --> 00:12:02,290
Put everything in the car
and get out of town.

188
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,410
I'll find you, if there are still roads!

189
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,386
Sweetie, sweetie, all you've
got to do is be responsible.

190
00:12:08,472 --> 00:12:11,700
Your friends consider you the leader
because you're a little taller.

191
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,643
Hmm. Wow. Wow!

192
00:12:14,695 --> 00:12:18,540
With above-average height comes
above-average responsibility.

193
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,340
Marge, thank you for
setting me straight.

194
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,810
You're welcome.

195
00:12:23,453 --> 00:12:26,988
Okay, I want to open this show
with someone being shot into a cannon.

196
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:30,909
You're joking, right?

197
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,020
Well, because, see, that's impossible.

198
00:12:39,469 --> 00:12:41,360
Gah! Oh.

199
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,555
Everyone, little miss
nitpick hates the show,

200
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,350
so I'm shutting it down.

201
00:12:47,344 --> 00:12:50,812
This was an act. Now it's just bullying.

202
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:01,900
Thanks a lot, Lisa.
We were getting out of school for this.

203
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:08,833
Well if isn't the little girl
that made a billionaire cry.

204
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:12,100
May I please speak with Mr. Burns?
- No, he's very busy.

205
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:16,850
Won't you please come
back and do the show?

206
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,720
Shan't.

207
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,447
Oh, that bell has quite the recoil.

208
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:27,623
Oh, what is bothering him?

209
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:30,520
And what were those weird
lines around his eyes?

210
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,790
I know. It's such a tragedy
on that beautiful face.

211
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,218
Come here. Well, there's only one
explanation for those lines, Lisa.

212
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:41,800
He's been watching something
on the Mutoscope.

213
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:46,600
So, if I play this,

214
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,190
I'll know the answer.

215
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,030
Mm-hmm. It, uh, costs a nickel.

216
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,100
So this is what made
Mr. Burns the monster he is.

217
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:22,000
Within days half of America
was cranking to my bottom.

218
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,900
I think you're trying to make up
for what happened to you then

219
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,516
by putting on a perfect Bowl show now.

220
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,930
Spare me you
amateur psychology.

221
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,800
"Ooh, I saw my father decapitated
by a grain harvester

222
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,524
"and now I can't enjoy wheat. Boohoo."

223
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,920
Mr. Burns, I want you to
listen to that crowd.

224
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:46,950
Do you really want to let those
happy, joyous people win?

225
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,410
Smithers, locate my dickey.

226
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,970
We've got a show to do.

227
00:15:05,723 --> 00:15:07,056
Springfield Nuclear.

228
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:09,141
Yes, yes, sir, I'll alert the workers...

229
00:15:09,227 --> 00:15:11,040
that the pizzas are here!

230
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,260
Oh, yeah, here he comes.

231
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,199
The life of this party!

232
00:15:17,235 --> 00:15:20,820
Who wants to get back to work?

233
00:15:20,905 --> 00:15:22,655
What?

234
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:25,708
We are a public trust.

235
00:15:25,743 --> 00:15:28,077
We bring power to people's homes.

236
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:32,190
Lightbulbs, toasters,
and that's all I can think of.

237
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,980
Now let's buckle down!

238
00:15:36,387 --> 00:15:39,922
Okay, Homer, just let us get our
microwave popcorn out of the core.

239
00:15:40,008 --> 00:15:43,690
You're only supposed to do that
when we're watching a movie in the core.

240
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,480
Thank you, thank you.

241
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,240
Well, that's the easiest time anyone's
had parking at the Springfield Bowl.

242
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,790
Don't you laugh at me!
Now, enjoy the show.

243
00:16:21,432 --> 00:16:23,890
God always liked you best.

244
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,469
No, God loves everyone equally.

245
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:28,700
That's wonderful news.

246
00:16:29,774 --> 00:16:31,870
Enough of your tomfoolery, Todd.

247
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,309
Let's sing.

248
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:36,479
BOTH: ♪ Michael, row your boat ashore ♪

249
00:16:36,531 --> 00:16:40,116
♪ Hallelujah ♪

250
00:16:40,151 --> 00:16:43,452
♪ Michael, row your boat ashore ♪

251
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:46,038
♪ Hallelu... ♪

252
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:51,090
Say, Sockie, who was that lady
I saw you with last night?

253
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,712
That was no lady.

254
00:16:52,797 --> 00:16:54,610
That was your mother.

255
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,330
Oh, she'll date anyone.

256
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,501
Why won't she give me a stable home?

257
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:00,430
Haw-haw!

258
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:14,930
Um, this is just a simple twins trick.

259
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,470
They pulled the other twin
out of the tank behind the curtain.

260
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,370
Wait, that wasn't part of the show.

261
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,699
No. No, it's not fair!

262
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:32,260
I was good!

263
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,520
- Arnold.
- Palmer!

264
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,342
Fantastic.
What a finale, eh, Mr. Burns?

265
00:17:40,378 --> 00:17:43,095
Childhood trauma cured, huh, huh?

266
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,760
That wasn't the finale.

267
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:53,189
Maestro,
"Golden Slippers," if you please.

268
00:17:53,224 --> 00:17:54,720
Ooh, boy.

269
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,410
We can't let him make a
fool of himself again.

270
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:05,630
No, no, Mr. Burns needs to do this.

271
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:11,190
♪ Oh, dem golden slippers ♪

272
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,292
♪ Oh, dem gold... ♪

273
00:18:13,377 --> 00:18:15,377
Ow, the burn. Ooh!

274
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:18,180
Mr. Burns can't take the
impact of that many photons.

275
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,140
Those light-shining fools!

276
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,469
Ow! Ah!

277
00:18:27,425 --> 00:18:30,040
Oh, for a murder of crows

278
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,894
to pluck out mine eyes!

279
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:34,160
You. This show was your fault.

280
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:36,682
Well, you'd better know this, mister.

281
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,560
This town has my back.

282
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,860
And... hey. Where did they go?

283
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,656
How did 15,000 people leave so fast?

284
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:48,310
Um... hey...
you wanna see me do a cartwheel?

285
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,115
Always had trouble with those.

286
00:18:54,418 --> 00:18:56,535
Oh, I can't stay mad at you.

287
00:18:56,621 --> 00:18:58,871
At my age, I can't stay
anything at anybody.

288
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,470
Oh, and you know what?
The laughter in my head is gone.

289
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,720
Go ahead, blow your German kazoo.

290
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,320
Yes, sir!

291
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,884
Smithers, tap my foot for me.

292
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:13,435
With impatience.

293
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:15,780
Now, lift my arm so
I can check my watch.

294
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,807
Oh, you really should start
doing some of these things yourself.

295
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,490
Dad, why do Simpsons always fail?

296
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:30,652
Oh, sweetie pie, it's a terrible
curse that goes back centuries.

297
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:34,720
No, no! Don't answer that.

298
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,275
We just need a place
to stay for the night.

299
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,340
Oh, shouldn't we help them?

300
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,560
Hey, in Zero BC, you
can't trust anybody.

301
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:46,550
- Curse them, Mary!
- You curse them, my water just broke!

302
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,060
Please?

303
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,459
You're telling me that really happened?

304
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:56,511
They looked just like us, didn't they?

305
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:10,840
Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's all, folks!
