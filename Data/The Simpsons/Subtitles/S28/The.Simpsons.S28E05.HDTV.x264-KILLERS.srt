66
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:39,229
I guess I could dress a little better.
Probably.

67
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:42,483
That's the most ambitious
thing you've ever said.

68
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:46,537
Guys, is there something
wrong with the way I dress?

69
00:03:46,572 --> 00:03:50,040
No. If you're a typewriter

70
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:53,744
Also, for a guy, you show
way too much cleavage.

Hey, these two have gotten me

Look, man, if people think
your clothes are outdated,

73
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:01,418
they'll think you're outdated.

How do I work this?

89
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:33,951
Where is that large automobile?

90
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:35,786
And you may tell yourself...

91
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:37,705
Okay, that's it.

(band plays upbeat

93
00:04:45,097 --> 00:04:47,131
Speaking of once-in-a-lifetime
experiences, Kent,

94
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:48,966
I understand you have
a fascinating story

95
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:50,634
about your time in Basra.

96
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:53,804
Well, Jimmy, I was embedded
with the 98th Airborne.

97
00:04:53,856 --> 00:04:55,939
My lullaby was the thwap-thwap-thwap

98
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:57,608
of the blades of a Chinook.

99
00:04:57,643 --> 00:04:59,309
I was in the 98th Airborne.

100
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:00,894
I don't remember him.

101
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,613
I don't even remember what I said

102
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:04,314
at the start of this sentence!

103
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:06,116
Out there, everyone was equal.

104
00:05:06,152 --> 00:05:08,118
I was "Brock," the pilot was "Bama."

105
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:09,319
Was he from Alabama?

106
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:10,988
He was from America, Jimmy.

107
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,207
To me, it was just another
day at the office.

108
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:15,826
Only this day, the office was
a burning piece of metal

109
00:05:15,878 --> 00:05:18,245
where an RPG just took out the pilot.

110
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,048
So I grabbed the joystick and
guided that wounded bird

111
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:23,834
down onto a container ship...
which was sinking.

112
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,336
I bailed it with my helmet
and guided her home.

113
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:27,838
(audience cheering)

114
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:31,675
That didn't happen, man!

115
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:34,478
Oh, you Iraq War vets
are always complaining.

116
00:05:34,513 --> 00:05:36,096
(mocking): "That didn't happen."

117
00:05:36,182 --> 00:05:39,433
"The temperature was 125."

118
00:05:39,518 --> 00:05:41,902
"The U.S.O. show was Rob Schneider."

119
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:46,240
"American objectives have been,
and remain, incomprehensible."

120
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:48,525
Wah-wah-wah.

121
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,112

We're at the dinner tables.

125
00:05:58,037 --> 00:05:59,953
KENT BROCKMAN: This is
Kent Brockman with a...

126
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:01,705
humble apology.

127
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,792
(dramatic kettle drum plays)

128
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:06,460
You know, we in the news business

129
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:08,879
like to report the story; we
don't like to be the story.

130
00:06:08,964 --> 00:06:11,348
That's what I said to Nelson
Mandela atop the Berlin Wall,

131
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:13,717
but... No, I didn't. That's the problem!

132
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:15,219
Now you're not eating.

133
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:17,638
I can't eat when I'm
watching the spectacle

134
00:06:17,723 --> 00:06:19,189
of an imploding celebrity.

135
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:20,891
We have lip-quiver, people.

136
00:06:20,976 --> 00:06:23,477
I'm sorry to report to
you that over the years,

137
00:06:23,562 --> 00:06:24,978
every interesting thing I've done is,

138
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:26,480
in fact, a complete lie.

139
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:28,232
I did not land a Chinook helicopter.

140
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:31,535
I did not see bin Laden die, or
even see the movie about it.

141
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,737
Now that I've apologized,
my station has assured me

142
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:35,405
that it has full confidence...

143
00:06:35,457 --> 00:06:38,408
These were the last words of
disgraced anchor Kent Brockman

144
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,410
before he was escorted out by security

145
00:06:40,462 --> 00:06:42,329
and replaced by me, Arnie Pye.

146
00:06:42,414 --> 00:06:44,047
This reporter promises

147
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,917
to restore our news
department's credibility.

148
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:50,637
In our top story, corporate
taxes are too high.

149
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:53,223
Geez, I'm really gonna
miss Anderson Cooper.

150
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:54,925
That wasn't Anderson Cooper.

151
00:06:54,977 --> 00:06:56,593
Oh, thank God.

152
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:58,812
I'm not licked yet...
not as long as I've got

153
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:01,231
a cell phone and a place to sit.

154
00:07:02,935 --> 00:07:04,101
Company car.

155
00:07:04,153 --> 00:07:05,319
(tires screech)

156
00:07:07,406 --> 00:07:10,324
Marge, I think I may
have to get new clothes.

157
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:11,775
(whispers): At last!

158
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:14,077
It's time for me to project the image

159
00:07:14,113 --> 00:07:16,780
of a powerful, self-reliant man.

160
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,949
Will you take me shopping after school?

161
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:21,585
Sure. And after that, maybe you could...

162
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,087
oh, I don't know, lose a little weight?

163
00:07:24,123 --> 00:07:26,957
Marge, no, don't get
greedy, don't get greedy.

164
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:31,295
Sweetheart, I'm always happy
to temporarily lose weight.

165
00:07:31,347 --> 00:07:32,629
Oh...

166
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,433
So, this app is called Smothr.

167
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:39,436
Lets my mom keep a
healthy eye on me 24/7.

168
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:42,723
Milhouse, you're overexcited.

169
00:07:42,808 --> 00:07:44,308
You're going to get a bloody nose.

170
00:07:44,393 --> 00:07:46,310
I will not!

171
00:07:46,395 --> 00:07:47,644
See?

172
00:07:47,696 --> 00:07:49,947
Hmm. I call these num-nums

173
00:07:49,982 --> 00:07:52,149
because they make my fingers numb.

174
00:07:52,234 --> 00:07:54,484
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

175
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,703
Why are the only ingredients here

176
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:59,740
"water, fun and hydrogenated chuckles"?

177
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:01,742
Hey, Krusty makes quality products.

178
00:08:01,827 --> 00:08:04,077
Incoming!

179
00:08:04,163 --> 00:08:06,330
Mm, let me try one of those candies.

180
00:08:10,836 --> 00:08:12,886
I shared a meal with Lisa.

181
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:15,839
It's halfway to a kiss.

182
00:08:15,925 --> 00:08:16,924
Now I kissed Lisa.

183
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:18,842
No one kissed Lisa!

184
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:20,644
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

185
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:23,096
Hmm, I don't think candy
should give me a tingling

186
00:08:23,182 --> 00:08:24,598
in my left arm.

187
00:08:24,683 --> 00:08:26,400
I'm gonna prove to you that Krusty

188
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:28,602
is a good clown with nonlethal candy.

189
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:31,321
Hey, Otto-man, can you take us
to the food processing district?

190
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:32,489
No way, Bartman.

191
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:33,857
Hey, Otto, I just remembered,

192
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,326
we have a field trip to the
food processing district.

193
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:37,861
Oh, man, we're late!

194
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:39,496

Homie?

214
00:09:35,804 --> 00:09:37,971
Oh, baby, you had the same idea I did.

215
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:39,389
Mmm!

216
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:41,758
This wasn't my idea, but... (gasps)

they're the first ones.

Wow. Ready for the corner office.

220
00:09:53,322 --> 00:09:55,906
I feel like Mrs. Mad Men.

221
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:58,275
Now let's get you rung up, lard-ass.

222
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,277
- What did you call me?
- Uh, Lord S.

223
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:01,361
Oh.

224
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:05,582
Well, we've got a nice-
looking couple here.

225
00:10:05,617 --> 00:10:07,417
Walk away, Marge, just walk away.

Wait, Homie. It's Kent Brockman.

228
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:13,757
The man who betrayed our trust.

229
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,792
I'm producing my own news content now.

230
00:10:15,878 --> 00:10:17,761
Could you spare a few sound bites

231
00:10:17,796 --> 00:10:19,629
(chuckles): for this rudderless anchor?

232
00:10:19,681 --> 00:10:21,882
Forget it. We only like
newspeople we can trust.

233
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:23,767
So no newspeople!

234
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:25,635
Oh, well, I have bigger problems.

High five, man!

Why do we call it "high five"
when we only have four fingers?

292
00:12:33,683 --> 00:12:35,183
You know, I've always wondered that.

00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,436
Uh, Lisa, these vials

295
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:40,571
are filled with formaldehyde.

296
00:12:40,657 --> 00:12:42,573
Formaldehyde! Do you understand?

297
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:44,025
Do not imbibe!

298
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,194
Check. No imbibing.

299
00:12:46,246 --> 00:12:50,114
Bart! Imbibing is eating,
and formaldehyde is poison.

300
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,034
Oh, you take all the fun
out of eating poison.

301
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,253
You're just an apologist for Krusty.

302
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:57,371
I am not a paid apologist for Krusty!

303
00:12:57,457 --> 00:12:59,090
I didn't say "paid."

304
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:01,542
Got to go. I'll see you in the future.

Sorry, kid, not

Krusty's our biggest star,

311
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:18,059
and formaldehyde's our biggest sponsor.

312
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:20,394
I'm gonna have to go off the grid.

313
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:37,078
All right, Kent Brockman.
Welcome to BizzFad.

314
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,830
We are so crunched.

315
00:13:38,915 --> 00:13:41,215
(chuckles): Well, the
crunching is mutual.

316
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:43,885
"The crunching is mutual"?
What the hell does that mean?

317
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
Well, I know that the media has changed,

318
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:49,006
but this old newshound can
still find his way home.

319
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:51,425
Okay...

320
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:54,095
I thought I might do a piece on

00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,096

00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:56,430

00:13:57,734 --> 00:14:00,101
Kent, I like it. I do.

325
00:14:00,186 --> 00:14:02,270
But we just went bankrupt.

326
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:04,272
Uh, people, people, you're all fired.

327
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:06,607
But, seriously, it's
been a great four days.

328
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:07,825
Thank you.

329
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,932
Uh, gentlemen, I suggest
we ramp up production.

330
00:14:11,957 --> 00:14:17,044
I have a few suggestions
right here in my pocket.

331
00:14:17,337 --> 00:14:19,620
Do it, Homer! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

332
00:14:19,706 --> 00:14:21,505
(gasps) Are you Lust?

333
00:14:21,591 --> 00:14:23,374
No. Lupus.

00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:24,342

335
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:26,627
Huh? Huh? Huh?

336
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,846
(chuckles) Hey, fatso,

337
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:31,215
I'd close that tent flap
before the mosquitoes get in.

339
00:14:32,302 --> 00:14:33,467
What the...?

340
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:35,469
I thought you would like it.

341
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:38,022
Actually, I think you
should take this tarp

342
00:14:38,107 --> 00:14:40,274
back to the baseball
stadium you got it from.

343
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,193
In case there's a rain delay.

344
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:44,862
(chuckles) I did not
see that coming, sir.

345
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:46,314
Off you go, Simpson.

346
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:48,115
Never seek to better yourself again.

347
00:14:48,151 --> 00:14:50,568
I'm just going to shove my foot
on your back for emphasis.

348
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:52,737
Yes, sir. I understand.

349
00:14:52,822 --> 00:14:55,573
But could you try not to
get my new jacket dirty?

350
00:14:55,658 --> 00:14:56,958
Sorry, but no.

351
00:14:58,294 --> 00:14:59,460
Well done, sir.

352
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:01,329
Now your turn, Smithers.

353
00:15:01,414 --> 00:15:02,997
I never thought you'd ask.

354
00:15:05,668 --> 00:15:08,552
So, why do you want to give
the story to Brockman?

355
00:15:08,638 --> 00:15:10,972
Because the best thing you
can do is offer a lifeline

356
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:12,807
to a person with no hope.

357
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:14,058
Here I am!

358
00:15:14,143 --> 00:15:15,309
Sorry, not you.

359
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:16,894
Thank God!

360
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,846
Well, how do you know
where Brockman will be?

361
00:15:18,932 --> 00:15:20,348
To find a fallen man,

362
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:22,850
you must visit the scene
of his highest peak.

363
00:15:22,936 --> 00:15:25,353
When he reported on the flood of '09.

364
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:30,324
My career and these flood waters
crested at the same time.

365
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,360
This is Kent Brockman blowing a sad song

366
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:33,778
on his beer bottle.

367
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:36,113
(playing sad tune)

368
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:41,085
Mr. Brockman, we've
uncovered a huge story!

369
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,705
And we need a real newsman
to break it wide open.

370
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:49,377
(sighs)

371
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:50,761
A real newsman, eh?

372
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:52,213
Then you've come to the wrong corner.

373
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:53,431
What do you mean?

374
00:15:53,516 --> 00:15:54,715
Oh, I'm through.

375
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:56,300
Now, please, let me just go out

376
00:15:56,386 --> 00:15:59,303
with my remaining dignity intact.

377
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:02,056
This is Kent Brockman thinking
dark and suicidal thoughts.

378
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,782
It's quiet here in the gutter.

379
00:16:03,807 --> 00:16:04,723
Very quiet.

380
00:16:04,748 --> 00:16:06,285
Well, it was.

381
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:08,864
_

382
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:11,287
Okay, who would like to start today?

383
00:16:11,322 --> 00:16:14,824
Anyone? Anyone?

384
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:16,709
Oh, come on.

385
00:16:19,463 --> 00:16:21,831
In three, two...

386
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,165
I'm here live at the support group...

387
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:24,500
Our top feeling today...

388
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:26,669
This just in: I'm sad.

389
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:28,671
(slurring): You know,
I'll be tooling around,

390
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:33,225
and I'll just constantly lapse
into my elocution exercises.

391
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:36,011
"A Lockheed L-1011 landed safely

392
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:38,681
in Bogalusa, Louisiana, after an alert."

393
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:39,765
Oh, I've been there.

394
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:41,317
- Too true.
- Courage.

395
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:44,153
Kent, you're looking
unusually thoughtful

396
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:45,688
and silent for an anchor.

397
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,356
You know, I thought I'd come to terms

398
00:16:47,408 --> 00:16:50,109
with life off the news
cycle, and then, bang,

399
00:16:50,194 --> 00:16:52,361
I was offered a scoop on a platter.

400
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:54,113
(slurring): Well, did
you leap on that lead

401
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:56,081
like a lion on a lemur?

402
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:59,869
I passed! As in, "I
am a thing of the..."

403
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:02,338
Dan Rather, do you have
something to contribute

404
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:04,840
besides this delicious
homemade Bundt cake?

405
00:17:04,876 --> 00:17:05,958
Mmm.

406
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:07,793
Kent, why are you doing this?

407
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:09,795
Why did you get into this business?

408
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:12,264
Money, women, free coffee. The usual.

409
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:16,268
Sir, if you please, these days,
a bona fide uncorrupted story

410
00:17:16,354 --> 00:17:18,637
is rarer than a snake with sneakers.

411
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:21,390
It's harder to find than a
yellow-fronted bowerbird.

412
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:22,892
Jump on it, hoss,

413
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:25,277
and ride till Gramma
churns the buttermilk.

414
00:17:25,363 --> 00:17:27,696
That's when the barn dance starts.

415
00:17:27,732 --> 00:17:28,697
What is that feeling?

416
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,733
Is it integrity?

417
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,568
♪ ♪

418
00:17:36,574 --> 00:17:38,374
Good to see ya, buddy. I'm in!

419
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:40,576
Anybody got eyeliner and pancake makeup?

420
00:17:40,628 --> 00:17:41,794
Take mine, brother.

421
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:44,079
Works great on Mediterranean skin.

422
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:47,800
It's from my personal
line, Rather Handsome.

423
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:51,470
Well, Marge, I was humiliated by Mr.
Burns, it's true.

424
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:54,840
But, to me, this is nothing
more than a temporary setback.

425
00:17:54,926 --> 00:17:58,010
Good for you, Homie. I'm proud of you.

426
00:17:58,095 --> 00:18:00,229
Hey, Homer Simpson is not deterred

427
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:01,931
by a footprint on his suit.

428
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:03,265
It'll come out, right?

429
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:05,901
- I don't know.
- (shrieks)

430
00:18:05,937 --> 00:18:08,604
Homer, I have a 12-step
plan for your success.

431
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:11,857
Step number one: get in a 12-step plan.

432
00:18:18,616 --> 00:18:21,450
(grunts) This is an opportunity!

433
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:23,002
(screams)

434
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:25,037
I think I'm going to Moe's.

435
00:18:25,122 --> 00:18:26,422
(tires screech)

436
00:18:26,457 --> 00:18:27,957
Krusty, we have evidence
that your product

437
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:30,376
is laced with toxic additives.

438
00:18:30,461 --> 00:18:32,177
Yeah. So why you bothering me?

439
00:18:32,263 --> 00:18:34,680
LISA: Because your tasty
little treat did this.

440
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:36,265
(whirring)

441
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,351
I made the doctor cry.

442
00:18:39,437 --> 00:18:41,971
They told me the paralysis
would be temporary!

443
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:43,305
Five years, tops.

444
00:18:43,391 --> 00:18:45,140
Seriously, come on,

445
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:47,526
that kid wasn't going anywhere anyway.

446
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:51,113
It looks like this clown could
not formalde-hide the truth.

447
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:53,315
(chuckles) This is Kent
Brockman, saying...

448
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:54,817
No! I'm gonna sing Beatles songs

449
00:18:54,902 --> 00:18:56,652
so you can't afford to show this video!

450
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:58,954
- A-one, two, three, four!
- Too late!

451
00:19:00,624 --> 00:19:01,957
Well, you're back on top, Kent.

452
00:19:01,993 --> 00:19:03,826
And now for a once monthly feature we do

453
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:04,994
called Serious Question.

454
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,161
(horn honks)

455
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,746
Tell us, how did you get this story?

456
00:19:07,832 --> 00:19:09,164
Well, it's funny, actually.

457
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:11,166
I was trapped in a burning building...

458
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:13,969
(gasps) Is he really gonna
take all the credit for this?

459
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:15,421
Don't ask me.

460
00:19:15,506 --> 00:19:16,922
The last newsman I could trust

461
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:20,509
was that bigamist, Charles Kuralt.

462
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:22,811
It was a burning building
called my career.

463
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:24,480
Thank God I had help.

464
00:19:24,515 --> 00:19:27,099
Lisa Simpson, you deserve to
be on this couch with me.

465
00:19:27,184 --> 00:19:29,234
But because I don't lie anymore,

466
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,687
I have to say I didn't fight
too hard when they said no.

467
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:33,572
Hmm. Is that enough?

468
00:19:33,657 --> 00:19:35,157
Are you kidding?

469
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:37,693
You got Hollywood's highest honor:

470
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:40,820
shared credit, no money.

471
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,493
I've been informed that
this is my last newscast

472
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,185
as anchor of the Channel 6 News.

473
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,282
Before I go, I'd like to get
a few things off my chest.

474
00:19:49,307 --> 00:19:52,008
I've made out with Kent's daughter.

475
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,510
The grown-up one!

476
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:54,727
Are you almost through?

477
00:19:54,813 --> 00:19:56,596
In a hurry to fail again, Kent?!

478
00:19:56,681 --> 00:19:58,848
No, it's just I've been off
the air for six weeks,

479
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:00,150
and it was torture.

480
00:20:00,185 --> 00:20:01,684
Sometimes I'd watch Bill O'Reilly

481
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,903
and pretend it was an older,
stupider version of me.

482
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:05,688
Go ahead. Take your chair.

483
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,857
Do what you do best.

484
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:13,246
Tonight's lotto numbers: six, 17, 42,

485
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:15,331
45 and 83!

486
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:17,417
I'm back!

487
