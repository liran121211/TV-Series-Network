00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:10,739
Why, you little...

00:00:10,806 --> 00:00:14,075
(both groaning)

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,429
Beneath this smile,
I'm in awful, awful pain!

8
00:00:17,496 --> 00:00:19,664
(screaming)

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,251
Welcome, precious
primetime viewers,

10
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:27,422
valued Internet downloaders,
and scary digital pirates!

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,258
If you want to shield
your little darlings

12
00:00:30,326 --> 00:00:33,244
from our stomach-churning
holiday special,

13
00:00:33,312 --> 00:00:36,080
simply hit fast-forward
on your DVR remote...

14
00:00:37,817 --> 00:00:40,084
(distorted grunting)

15
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:50,678
I went too far!

16
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:52,397
Spoiled the whole
show for everybody!

17
00:00:52,465 --> 00:00:55,450
I don't deserve
to wield the remote.

18
00:00:55,518 --> 00:00:57,702
(shuddering):
Oh, I'm getting old and gray...

19
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,038
I'm dead.

20
00:01:00,105 --> 00:01:01,639
(spooky music plays)

21
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:07,061
Monster go watch <i>The Office.</i>

22
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:11,666
Dunder-Mifflin just like
monster's workplace.

28
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:44,319
Milhouse, do we have enough
points for a weapons upgrade?

29
00:01:44,386 --> 00:01:47,472
Yeah! We really racked them up
eating all those elf babies.

30

Ha-ha! Nothing beats
a weapon made of weapons.

31
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:56,848
This is that video game Reverend
Lovejoy said you shouldn't play.

32
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:58,533
Well, <i>he's</i> playing
it right now.

33
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:00,585
Slay the wounded!

34
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,854
I still think it's too violent.

35
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:05,373
It's a game. We're
not hurting anybody.

36
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:07,108
My non-lazy eye!

37
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:08,843
Ooh.

38
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:12,413
These classic board
games are fun <i>and</i> safe.

39
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:13,982
(grunting)

40
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:15,383

(sighs)

42
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:20,255
So which of these
"board lames" shall we play?

43
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:21,306
Taffy Land?

44
00:02:21,373 --> 00:02:22,307
Drops and Risers?

45
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:23,341
Consternation?

46
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,676
Ravenous, Ravenous Rhinos?

47
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:25,910
Mouse Catch?
Battleboat?

48
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:27,212
Funopoly?
Crate of Apes?

49
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:28,713
Yahtzu?
Tiddlywonks?

50
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:32,283
Hey, I've never seen
this one before.

51
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:34,219
MILHOUSE:
Satan's Path?

52
00:02:34,286 --> 00:02:36,938
Hey, it's got to be good
if Satan put his name on it.

53
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:41,342
Huh?

54
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,278
Here. I'll be the demon,
you be the thimble.

55
00:02:43,345 --> 00:02:44,779
Oh, I'm always
the thimble.

56
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:50,235
One...

57
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:52,470
(rumbling)
(gasps)

58
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:54,372
Two.

Ooh!

(shouting)

62
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:06,050
There was a bank
error in my favor.

63
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:09,120
And I'm spending it all on
Oriental Avenue prostitutes!

64
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,725

I don't like the looks
of that knight, Chief.

68
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:29,140
Don't worry.
We're safe.

69
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,409
He's two steps away,
and one to the right.

70
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:35,897
(groans)

71
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:39,234
For me, it's game,
set... and match.

72
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:41,469
I think you mean
"check, and mate."

73
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:43,371
Just got crushed by
a giant horse, Lou.

74
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,540
You want to cut me a break?

75
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:47,242
(romantic music plays)

76
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:49,944
Time to meet my mystery dude.

77
00:03:51,113 --> 00:03:52,213
(chuckling)

78
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:53,248
(sighs)

79
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,102
Ah.

(Homer grunting)

81
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:01,990
Oh, man, I'm never coming down!

82
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:03,007
Ah!

83
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:04,842
Whoo-hoo! Another ladder!

84
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,994
Riding high!

85
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,362
Sinking low!

86
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:08,780
Top of the heap!

87
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,515
Oh! Down I go!

88
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,133
On top for good!

89
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:14,035
Oh, cruel hubris!

90
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,891
How do we make this stop?

91
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,459
Well, my Latin's
a little rusty,

92
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,494
but I think to get everything
back in its box,

93
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:24,712
you have to finish the game.

94
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,615
And if we don't finish?

95
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:30,285
You're going to have to deal
with more nonsense like that.

96
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:33,972
ALL:
Yatszu.

97
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,507
Here we go,
back in the cup.

98
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:38,726
At least the cup
is lined with felt.

99
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,728
Hey, Mr. Positive,
shut the hell up.

100
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:44,248
(roars)

101
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:45,616
(monkey chattering)

102
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:47,935
(buzzing)

103
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:49,704
(chattering)

104
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:51,139
(rumbling crash)

105
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:55,393
We'll be safe on
this Battleboat.

106
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,578
Set a course for B-7.

107
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:59,263
(motor humming)

108
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,418
POWERFUL VOICE:
B-7.

109
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:04,719
MILHOUSE:
They dunked our Battleboat!

110
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:06,854
I wish I could see
my mom one last time,

111
00:05:06,922 --> 00:05:08,856
so I can say, "This
is all your fault!"

112
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:13,244
Colonel Ketchup, I say
it was you that killed him

113
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:15,980
in the parlor,
with the letter-opener!

114
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:20,151
He was going to leave me, and
I'm too old to find anyone else.

115
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,285
(grumbles)

116
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:22,987
Come on, man, climb up!

117
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:24,989
No. I might sink the letter.

118
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:27,375
And "Q" is just too valuable.

119
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:28,943
That blank could be
any letter we want.

120
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:32,697
Maybe I'm just tired of living.

121
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:33,564
(bubbles gurgling)

122
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,371
The final challenge: Mousecatch.

123
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,673
A game so lame,
no one's ever finished it.

124
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,728
(wild cackling and roaring)

125
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,313
Crazy Eights!

126
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:50,648
Think, Bart. Think!

127
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:53,251
What was that lesson I
learned from video games?

128
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:55,470
Oh, yeah! Kill, kill, kill!

129
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:56,687
(crying)

130
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:01,159
There comes a time to beat
the crap out of childish things.

131
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:02,443
(wild raving)

132
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,361
(groaning)

133
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,180
(gasps)

134
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,578
Sure is a hard way
to catch a mouse.

135
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,052
Oh, this stupid
thing never works.

136
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,154
(grunts)

137
00:06:42,451 --> 00:06:45,002
That's it. From now on,
we'll just play Hangman.

138
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,070
Wait, wait.

139
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:47,688
We still got one more letter.

140
00:06:47,756 --> 00:06:49,557
Is it... 3?

141
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,993
(buzzer sounds)
That's not a letter.

142
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,812
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

143
00:07:05,453 --> 00:07:07,471
(ominous music plays)

144
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:10,283
(gasps)

145
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,235
(screams)

146
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:15,864
Man, it's been a crazy morning.

147
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,287
Champagne?

148
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:21,525
Oh, Homie, what
a great idea--

149
00:07:21,593 --> 00:07:23,927
to take a cruise
in uncharted waters.

150
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:26,480
Yeah, charts are
for squares, baby.

151
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:31,018
(grunting)

152
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:33,787
Whew. Sure is hot out here.

153
00:07:33,855 --> 00:07:35,055
Mmm.

154
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:36,757
Mmm.
(slide whistle tone)

155
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:38,692
Oh, that's my cell phone.

156
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:42,562
What is it?

157
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,815
Lenny, I'm on a
second honeymoon!

158
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:47,117
You'll have to pick
your own Lotto numbers.

159
00:07:47,185 --> 00:07:48,986
Now, where were we?

160
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:53,023
(both giggling)

161
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:54,891
Oh, baby, let's give
those seagulls

162
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,426
something to squawk about.

163
00:07:56,494 --> 00:07:58,128
(giggles)

164
00:07:58,196 --> 00:07:59,930
Huh?

165
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:01,765
Oh yeah, baby, I like
it when you're distracted.

166
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:02,766
Huh?

167
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:04,301
(oars splashing)

168
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,455
Homie, help him up.

169
00:08:08,523 --> 00:08:11,325
(sighs)
Fine. I'll get the hook.

170
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:14,795
HOMER:
Don't fight it.

171
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:17,014
(man mumbling)
Don't... That's it.

172
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:19,116
A little more.

173
00:08:19,183 --> 00:08:21,168
How's that?

174
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:22,402
(panting)

175
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,538
You're safe now, my friend.

176
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,673
This poor man must have
been out there for days.

177
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:30,344
He's nothing but
hard, bronze muscle.

178
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,347
Bless you.

179
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:38,085
Okay, this guy's
taken care of.

180
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:40,053
So... uh, you know...

My name's Roger.

187
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:07,447
I was the chef on the <i>Albatross,</i>
working for a businessman

188
00:09:07,515 --> 00:09:09,816
taking his partners to Tahiti.

189
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:13,570
One night, he asked
for pie for dessert...

190
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,556
<i>As the pie cooled innocently</i>
<i>on a porthole sill,</i>

191
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:20,110
<i>my employer attempted</i>
<i>to inject it with poison.</i>

192
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:22,579
<i>But I caught him in the act.</i>

193
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:25,565
<i>Unfortunately, he had the</i>
<i>strength of ten businessmen.</i>

194
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:28,902
<i>He sent me napward with a</i>
<i>bottle of low-sodium soy sauce.</i>

195
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,139
Poor man. You've been
through so much.

196
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:35,058
Hey. I've had a hard trip, too.

197
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:38,061
One of the lenses fell
out of my sunglasses!

198
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:41,164
Ah... oh, yeah...

199
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:44,601
Oh, Roger, you really
know what you're doing.

200
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:45,736
(gasps)

201
00:09:45,803 --> 00:09:47,738

202
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:49,272
No luck.

203
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:55,028
Anyway, when I came to,
everyone on board was dead.

204
00:09:57,632 --> 00:09:59,032
<i>I fled the horrific scene.</i>

206
00:10:00,535 --> 00:10:02,152
<i>And after days at sea,</i>

207
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,054
<i>I found my savior.</i>

208
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:05,388
<i>You, Marge.</i>

209
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:08,792
And, in a very insignificant
way, you, Homer.

210
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,494
God, it was horrible.

211
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:13,830
Marge? Can I have a word
with you in private?

212
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:16,566
I don't trust that guy.

213
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:18,769
I bet he killed everyone
on that boat himself.

214
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:20,570
That's crazy talk.

215
00:10:20,638 --> 00:10:22,672
ROGER:
Excuse me.

216
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,808
You've both been so kind to me,

217
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:28,812
I baked you this pie.

218
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,581
That is so sweet.

219
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:34,901
Why do piemakers
get all the girls?

220
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,554
Why did you do that?

221
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:38,805
It was poisoned!
No it wasn't!

222
00:10:38,873 --> 00:10:40,257
Well, it was rhubarb.

223
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:41,441
No, it was berry-peach.

224
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:43,426
HOMER: Berry-peach?
That's my favorite!

225
00:10:43,494 --> 00:10:47,130
Please, Homer. I am so sick of
this unmotivated jealous--

(screams)

227
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:54,588
The pie was poisoned.
You were right.

228
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:57,924
I guess we've got to kill
him before he kills us.

229
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:01,328
Well, we'd better do it quick,
because he's making scones!

230
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:08,351
They should call this one
"Recipe For Murder."

231
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:09,853
What do you mean,
"this one"?

232
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:10,787
Never mind.

233

240
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:39,249
We just killed a man.

241
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:42,419
Yeah, the decent thing
to do is bury him at sea.

242
00:11:49,393 --> 00:11:50,760
Come and get it, barnacles.

243
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:00,120

Roger <i>was</i> telling

This proves nothing.

248
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,872
Roger could've been the
one that killed them.

249
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,340
Soy sauce.

250
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:22,676

The pie was clean.

263
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:52,055
The shark died from the fuel

an antidote before dinner.

just a vampire.

363
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:40,707
I'm a nut
for Dixieland jazz.

364
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:42,592
(playing New Orleans jazz)

365
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:48,197
(sighs) You said you weren't
going to bring that.

366
00:17:48,265 --> 00:17:49,999
I said I <i>might</i> not.

367
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:52,302
(continues playing)

368
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:54,754
They say vampires
live forever,

369
00:17:54,822 --> 00:17:57,457
but I die of
embarrassment every day.

370
00:17:57,524 --> 00:17:59,158
I know just how you feel.

371
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:04,147
Let's fly, Lisa.

372
00:18:04,214 --> 00:18:07,900
Keep your mouth closed,
or you'll swallow a lot of bugs.

373
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:08,835
(gasps)

374
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:11,237
Get them back!

375
00:18:11,305 --> 00:18:12,705
She can't get neck holes.

376
00:18:12,773 --> 00:18:14,340
It's picture day tomorrow!

377
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:17,193
Man, you vamps got it made.

378
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:18,778
You sleep all day...

379
00:18:18,845 --> 00:18:20,613
And, because we only
drive at night,

380
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:22,949
we can really time the
traffic lights. Watch.

381
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:25,368
Green. Green. Green.

382
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:26,786
Boom. Green.

383
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:28,438
Yes. Boom.

384
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:30,490
Green. Good. Boom.

385
00:18:33,577 --> 00:18:36,913
Boy, this place has every kind
of vampire there is.

386
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,837
Excuse me.

387
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:46,289
Have you seen these kids?

388
00:18:46,357 --> 00:18:47,774
I did.

389
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:49,842
And they were sneaking kisses.

390
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,344
One kiss!

391
00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:52,779
Ha, ha, ha.

392
00:18:52,846 --> 00:18:54,380
Two kisses!

393
00:18:54,448 --> 00:18:55,782
Ha, ha, ha.

394
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:57,216
Three kisses!

395
00:18:57,284 --> 00:18:58,217
There they are.

396
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:02,488
Super-Team, fly!

397
00:19:02,556 --> 00:19:04,340
(grunting)

398
00:19:04,408 --> 00:19:06,275
I'm Dracula, not The Hulk.

399
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:08,011
Hyah! Hyah!

400
00:19:08,078 --> 00:19:09,479
(groaning)

401
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:16,736
Bite me now, Edmund,
and we'll both be vampires.

402
00:19:16,804 --> 00:19:19,288
Get your neck away
from my son's teeth,

403
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:20,740
you evil temptress.

404
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:24,093
Sir, I'm not trying to take
your son away from you.

405
00:19:24,161 --> 00:19:26,262
I plan to be a part of
your rich culture,

406
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,831
and organize media-friendly
events to help combat

407
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:30,967
all the unfair
vampire stereotypes.

408
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:33,269
Wow. Wow!

409
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:35,355
Now I know what you see
in this girl.

410
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:36,522
Bite her, my son,

411
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,207
and you both will be
eight forever.

412
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:40,026
Eight forever?

413
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:41,861
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

414
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:44,697
I can't spend eternity
using kid scissors.

415
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:46,099
They barely cut anything.

416
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,200
(snarls) Too late!

417
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:49,585
The bloodlust
is upon me.

418
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:50,837
(gasps)

419
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:52,438
Back off, you unholy dreamboat!

420
00:19:52,506 --> 00:19:53,373
(yells)

421
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:59,612
Pretty ironic-- a cross
being used to kill someone.

422
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,780
(sizzling)

423
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:02,682
(screaming)

424
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:07,704
Father, you're hurt.

425
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:11,040
Yes, but at least
you are safe, my son.

426
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:15,144
Whoa, you blood-sucking
freaks love your kids, too?

427
00:20:15,212 --> 00:20:18,548
I remember when he was a baby,
I'd sneak up to his crib

428
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:20,483
in the middle of the day
to make sure

429
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:22,351
he was still not breathing.

430
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:23,586
(sobs softly)

431
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:25,405
No...!

432
00:20:25,472 --> 00:20:27,907
Well, nobody loves his kids
more than me!

433
00:20:27,975 --> 00:20:29,058
(grunts)

434
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:30,176
Come and get it!

435
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:32,345
(vampires grunting)

436
00:20:32,413 --> 00:20:34,380
Die, fatso!

437
00:20:34,448 --> 00:20:35,615
Uh-oh.

438
00:20:35,682 --> 00:20:37,817
His blood-- it's
full of cholesterol.

439
00:20:37,885 --> 00:20:39,085
And not the good kind.

440
00:20:39,153 --> 00:20:40,086
(laughing)

441
00:20:40,154 --> 00:20:42,505
(groaning)

442
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:43,906
Woo-hoo!

443
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:45,374
LISA:
Uh, Dad?

444
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:47,176
They turned you
into a vampire.

445
00:20:47,244 --> 00:20:48,811
Yes! I can fly!

446
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:50,079
See you back
at the house.

447
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:51,481
(laughing)

448
00:20:51,565 --> 00:20:52,732
(gasping)
Uh-oh.

449
00:20:52,783 --> 00:20:53,850
No...!

450
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:54,784
(thud)

451
