00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:46,158
you have a very poor

321
00:15:46,226 --> 00:15:49,762
I bought it because
Catherine Zeta-Jones told me to.

322
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:52,097
What a fool I was.

323
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:54,700
Secondly, there's been
a major breach of trust

00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:56,969
between Bart and
Santa's Little Helper.

325
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,203
Well, he shouldn't kill birds.

326
00:15:58,271 --> 00:15:59,571
It's not right.

327
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,241
That is correct,
according to human standards.

328
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:06,345
But all a dog can do is follow
his animal inclinations, right?

329
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:07,279

00:16:07,347 --> 00:16:08,847

with the larger brain...

332
00:16:10,884 --> 00:16:12,584
Nicely done, boy.

333
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:15,154
...maybe you can find it
in your heart to forgive him.

337
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:25,431
Bart, could you

339
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:32,588
It's not going to work.

340
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:34,089
You have to give the dog away.

341
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:35,557
Are you sure?

342
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,609

we've found him a new home

run and play all day.

You're gonna put him down?

358
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:17,100
really is going to
a farm upstate.

359
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:18,569
What about all the other pets

360
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:20,370
you told us
went to a farm upstate?

361
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:23,774
Hmm. Backyard, backyard,
toilet, ocean, don't know,

362
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:27,144
backyard, Flanders' mailbox,
Lenny's freezer, tire fire.

363
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,483
This is where
we're ditching the dog?

364
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:35,886
Well, "ditching"
is a harsh word.

365
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,120
Enough chitchat.

366
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:38,822
Time for Operation
Dog Dump.

367
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,724
It wasn't really
a lot of chitchat.

368
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:41,858
It was still
too much.

369
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:49,266
We'll take good
care of your dog.

370
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,734
I'm sure you will,

371
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:53,236
because you take such good care
of your ostriches.

372
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:54,671
(humming)

373
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:55,739
D'oh.

374
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,873
Maybe we should
get going.

375
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:01,912
Bart, sweetie, would you
like to say good-bye?

376
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:06,316
Well, boy, I guess this is it.

377
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:08,418
We've shared a lot
of great memories,

378
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:10,754
like the time we got
our picture in the paper

379
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:12,956
with the caption
"Who's walking who?"

380
00:18:13,024 --> 00:18:15,459
I mailed them the answer,
but they never printed it.

381
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:16,860
(sniffles)

382
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:19,696
But it's not my fault
you're leaving, it's yours.

383
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:20,831
Because you should never,

384
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:22,432
ever kill a bird!

385
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:23,417
Ever!

386
00:18:23,484 --> 00:18:25,485
I'd like a moment to myself.

387
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,556
(cell phone ringing)

388
00:18:29,624 --> 00:18:31,908
Ooh, unknown caller!

389
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:32,909
(squawks)

390
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:33,810
Hey!

391
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:40,450
All right, you, give me back
my phone and nobody gets hurt!

392
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:41,451
(grunts)

393
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,020
You said nobody gets hurt!

394
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:44,788
Those were your exact words!

395
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:47,324
(grunting)

396
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,226
(whimpers)

397
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,996
(squawking)

398
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:54,031
(grunting)

399
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:56,199
(screaming)

400
00:19:00,338 --> 00:19:03,073
So, Lisa, do you want an
ostrich feather centerpiece?

401
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:04,508
Not really.

402
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,243
Well, we've got
to buy something.

403
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,944
(ostrich squawking,
Bart screaming)

404
00:19:09,113 --> 00:19:10,180
Help!

405
00:19:10,248 --> 00:19:11,748
(barking)

406
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:13,383
Kill the bird!
(growling)

407
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:16,119
Never kill a bird!
Never kill a bird!

408
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:17,654
(whimpering)

409
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:26,663
Why, you little...

410
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:28,465
(pained squawking)

411
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:36,139
Pa! You got to see this!

412
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:39,609
Oh, right, I-I forgot.

413
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:41,511
(pained squawking)

414
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:45,916
(groans):
Oh.

415
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,688
More Oxycontin
Candy, sweetie?

416
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:52,589
Mm-hmm.

417
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,999
Well, boy, I guess
I owe you an apology.

418
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:05,035
Who's a bird-eating monster?

419
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,703
You are! You are!

420
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:08,638
Yes, you are.

421
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:10,140
Aw.

422
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,943
Well, Bart learned a lesson,
and most important of all,

423
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,029
we don't have to stop
and pick up dinner.

424
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:17,497
You do for me.

00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:35,327
HOMER:
<i>Help me!</i>

00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:18,404
Shh!
