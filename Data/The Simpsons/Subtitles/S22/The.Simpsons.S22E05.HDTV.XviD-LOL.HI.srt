Now listen up, kids.

17

Krusty's sponsor, the Texxon
family of gas stations,

18
00:00:56,438 --> 00:00:59,340
wants you to know
that today's the last day

19
00:00:59,408 --> 00:01:02,777
of their "Happy Little Elves"
giveaway!

20

It's Texxon's way of saying,

21
00:01:04,746 --> 00:01:07,648
"Sorry about
those million dead pelicans."

Maggie, you can't
climb into the TV.

29
00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:28,269
If you could, I'd make Alex
Trebek answer some questions.

30
00:01:28,337 --> 00:01:30,154
Dad, I think
Maggie's just sad

31
00:01:30,222 --> 00:01:33,257
'cause her set is missing
"Baby Must-Have."

32
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:36,911
No child of mine will go
without anything, ever!

33
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:39,764
Except quality health care!

34
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:43,084
Didn't there used
to be more Texxon stations?

35
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:46,954
Yes, but they sold a bunch off
to that frozen yogurt chain.

36
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:48,889
(ringing)

37
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:53,377
What a cheap
date this is.

38
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:55,980
I'm not cheap, baby, I'm
embarrassed to be seen with you.

39
00:01:56,048 --> 00:01:57,448
Big difference.
Hmm...

40
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:02,653

41
00:02:02,704 --> 00:02:04,455
Hmm. Nice part of
town you got here.

42
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:06,474
Too bad you keep
it so far away.

43
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,975
(laughing)

44
00:02:08,043 --> 00:02:09,944
Now that we're best friends,
can I get the baby elf?

45
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:11,162
Pick a box.

46
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:12,596
You get what you get.

47
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:14,365
You can't tell
what's inside!

48
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:17,234
Oh, of all the times not
to have x-ray vision.

49
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:20,137
Mm... I'll take that one.

50
00:02:23,258 --> 00:02:25,659
Hmm?

51
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:28,396
This isn't the right one.
She wants the baby.

52
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:30,264
I can't give you another toy

53
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:32,800
till you buy another
ten gallons of gas.

54
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:35,002
You're lucky you're
behind glass.

55
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,271
Ain't no glass.
(groans)

56
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:39,340
Sure, it's easy
to slap people

57
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:40,441
when you're hiding
behind that glass!

58
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:41,592
(grunts)

59
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,194
You have a good day.

60
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:45,562
Drive all the way,
get the wrong elf.

61
00:02:45,614 --> 00:02:46,981
Ain't no glass.

62
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:48,416
I'll show them.

63
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:51,519
I'll buy ten more gallons
of their stupid gas.

64
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:53,587

D'oh!

84
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:43,637
Oh, Homie, maybe we
should call it a day.

85
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:46,674
Oh, I'm sorry, Maggie,
but even at your age,

86
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:49,927
I'm sure you understand
things can't always go your way,

87
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:54,265
and that's why I can't believe
we didn't get that stupid elf!

88
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:56,200
(sobbing)

89
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:00,438

like these before.

91
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:06,444
(gasps)
I know where we are!

92
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:08,529
This is the neighborhood
where I grew up!

93
00:04:08,613 --> 00:04:11,081
Ooh, everything's changed.

94
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:13,417
That tree used to be
a smaller tree.

95
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:16,787
And that food bank used
to be a regular bank.

96
00:04:16,838 --> 00:04:19,156
The march of progress.

97
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:21,492
(gasps)
There's my old house!

98

(tires squeal, sighs)

99
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:25,846
Someday when I'm a grownup,
maybe I'll go back

100
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:27,448
and look fondly
at our house.

101
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:30,351
Well, stop in and say "hi" to me
'cause I'll still be there,

102
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:33,087
chillin' in my
basement bachelor pad.

103
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:35,890
Be sure to water the flowers
on my backyard grave.

104
00:04:35,957 --> 00:04:37,291
As long as I can dig you up

105
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:39,426
and stick you on the front porch
every Halloween.

106
00:04:39,494 --> 00:04:41,612
Just don't dress me up like a woman.
We'll see.

are here for.

109
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:47,251
Rabbits!

110
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,320
I just kilt this one
because it stopped bein' cute!

111
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:51,288
We're not here
for rabbit.

112
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:53,824
I used to live in
this house as a girl.

113
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:55,693
I live in it now as a woman.

114
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,528
Hey, you wanna come on in?
Take a look around?

115
00:04:57,596 --> 00:05:00,297
Oh, I'd love to,
if it's not an imposition.

116
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:02,666
Well, as long as we don't
have to feed this one.

117
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:05,102
(woman and Homer laugh)

118
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,470
Tell her "no deal."

119
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:10,674
Everything's just
the way I remember it.

120
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:12,009
You see that mirror?

121
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:14,178
I discovered that if I sat
in the kitchen,

122
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:16,046
I could see
if the bathroom was free

123
00:05:16,114 --> 00:05:19,016
using the reflection
from the mirror off the toaster.

124

130
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:32,363
I want to go read books
in the car.

131
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,131
There are no books
in the car.

132
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,267
I just want to
sit in the car!

133
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:38,752
I always wondered
who "Marge" is.

134
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:41,655
(gasps)
My memorables!

135
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:43,591
Over the years, I've
sure been tempted

136
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:44,959
to go through
this stuff.

137
00:05:45,026 --> 00:05:46,961
So I did, many times.

138
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:48,362
(clattering noise in room)

139
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,531

140

141
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:56,403
I never really had
the hair for these.

142
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:57,938
Wow, Mom.

143
00:05:58,006 --> 00:06:00,407
You got first place
in the science fair.

144
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:02,042
Oh, that's
ancient history.

145
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,945
Ooh, here's my paper
on ancient history.

146
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:09,266
Mom, these grades are amazing.

147
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:11,151
Just as good as mine.

153
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:24,982
The drainage
around here is a joke.

154
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,184
I don't even know
why I pay taxes.

155
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:28,319

00:07:23,274 --> 00:07:25,743
Is it true my mom
was a great student?

181
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,512
Oh, indeed. Your mother was
as fine a student as you.

182
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,747
Keep up the good work,

183
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:31,482
and you'll probably
wind up just like her.

184
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:33,817
Well...

185
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:36,120
Of course that would be great.

186
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:39,990
But I see myself making
an impact outside the home.

187
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:42,826
(chuckles)
Lisa, one of the
hardest jobs I have

188
00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:45,295
is throwing cold water on
young children's dreams.

189
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:47,131
Ralph, you're not a kangaroo.

190
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:48,732
(groans of disappointment)

191
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,502
The point is, I've learned
a lot about human nature

192
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:52,870
by sitting in the
park with Mother.

193
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:54,438
And one thing I've learned

194
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:56,540
is children turn out
like their parents.

195
00:07:56,608 --> 00:08:00,494
Behold, your future.

196
00:08:00,562 --> 00:08:02,229
(sadly):
Oh...

197
00:08:03,498 --> 00:08:05,999
Ralph, you're also
not a trophy.

198
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,768
(groans sadly)

199
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:09,103
Skinner!

200
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,605
I warned you about
interacting with students.

201
00:08:11,673 --> 00:08:13,440
I don't want to have
to yell at you!

202
00:08:13,508 --> 00:08:14,975
You yell at me
about everything.

203
00:08:15,043 --> 00:08:16,577
Well I can't yell
at anyone else!

204
00:08:16,644 --> 00:08:19,413
Teachers have a union.
Students have parents.

205
00:08:19,481 --> 00:08:21,281
What about Willie?
I like Willie!

206
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,699
Maggie, something
happened to Mom,

207
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:28,872
and I'm gonna find out
what and when.

208
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:31,541
Mom's looking good through
elementary school.

209
00:08:31,609 --> 00:08:35,145
Ninth grade, tenth grade,
still riding the A-Train.

210
00:08:35,212 --> 00:08:38,281
Then suddenly, when she was
a high school senior...

211
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:40,016
Blam!

212
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:41,885
MARGE:
You kids play nice up there!

213
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:43,820
What could have happened?

214
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:49,259
(ominous music plays)

215
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:00,537
(Homer humming happy tune)

216
00:09:04,074 --> 00:09:05,275
Dad?
Hmm?

217
00:09:05,342 --> 00:09:06,476
Can I talk to
you for a second?

218
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:08,378
What is troubling you,
my son?

219
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:11,181
I mean, my girl son?

220
00:09:11,248 --> 00:09:14,417
Well, um, I was looking
through Mom's old schoolwork,

221
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:17,220
and I noticed her
grades went down

222
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:19,122
when she started
going out with you.

223
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,890
Hey, if it hadn't been me,

224
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,826
it would have been
someone or something else.

225
00:09:22,893 --> 00:09:25,595
Sooner or later,
everyone meets their Homer.

226
00:09:28,582 --> 00:09:30,383
No offense, Dad,

227
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:33,586
but no boy is gonna
distract me from my dreams.

228
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:36,322
It may not be a boy.
It could be anything:

229
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,926
scrapbooking, high-stakes poker,
or the Santa Fe lifestyle.

230
00:09:39,994 --> 00:09:43,296
Just pick a dead end
and chill out till you die.

231
00:09:43,364 --> 00:09:45,798
No! That's not
gonna happen to me!

232
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:49,235
I'm gonna make sure
nothing distracts me ever!

233
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:50,453
(whistling nonchalantly)

234
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:52,355
Whoa!
Look at you,

235
00:09:52,423 --> 00:09:55,275
strutting around, like
you're Toad of Toad Hall.

236
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:57,343
Uh, I'm just whistling, man.

237
00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:59,679
(whistling feebly)

238
00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:02,015
You think you're so smart,
don't you , Simpson?

239
00:10:02,082 --> 00:10:03,983
We're both in
the same reading group.

240
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:05,852
I think you know
how smart I am.

241
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,988
That's an insult to me
and the rest of the inchworms.

242
00:10:09,056 --> 00:10:09,989
(grunts)

243
00:10:10,057 --> 00:10:11,407
(groans)

244
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:13,009
Bart did it again!

245
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:14,360
I'm not a bully!

246
00:10:14,428 --> 00:10:17,614
It's just a series
of incredible coincidences.

247
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:20,033
Well, Bart, I guess his
parking spot is yours now.

248
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,434
Well done.

249
00:10:21,502 --> 00:10:22,936
(exasperated grunt)

250
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:24,454
(crickets chirping)

251
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:26,673
Okay, I've gotten rid

252
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,008
of all of my distractions,
diversions,

253
00:10:29,076 --> 00:10:30,510
hobbies...
(gasps)

254
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:31,811
Oh, my God!

255
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:35,248
Are you a distraction
or a higher calling?

256
00:10:35,316 --> 00:10:36,616
All right, let's see.

257
00:10:36,684 --> 00:10:40,036
How many jazz musicians
led long and happy lives?

258
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:41,955
There's, um...

259
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:46,926
(sniffing)

260
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:49,195
(muffled notes playing)

261
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:54,367
That's odd. Lisa just threw
her saxophone out the window.

262
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:56,553
Oh, that's probably
because to her,

263
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,821
the saxophone is a me,

264
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:00,590
she shdoe don't want
to end up like you.

265
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:02,258
Good night.

266
00:11:02,326 --> 00:11:04,427
She doesn't want
to end up like me?

267
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:07,397
Uh, no, she <i>does,</i>
totally, but, uh,

268
00:11:07,464 --> 00:11:09,582
with a happier
ending. Good night.

269
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,618
What's so wrong
with <i>me?</i>

270
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:13,336
(chuckles) Nothing,
sweetie, nothing.

271
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:15,054
Here, let me explain.

272
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:17,307
She does not want to...

273
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:19,442
turn out like... you...

274
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,744
didn't... not until...

275
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:24,080
diplomatic... trapped...

276
00:11:24,148 --> 00:11:25,398
help.

277
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:27,317
(à la hypnotist, claps twice)
Remember nothing!

278
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:30,219
I remember everything.

279
00:11:30,287 --> 00:11:33,556
Well, if you check your purse,
I think you'll find...

280
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:36,142
the seven of clubs!

281
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:39,662
No.

282
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,700
Just a picture of Lisa--
who wants to be nothing like me.

283
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:45,802
I am so sorry, Marge.

284
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:48,471
Hee-hee-hee.

285
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:49,505
MARGE:
<i>Stupid pan!</i>

286
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:51,975
(frustrated grunting)

287
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:54,143
Mom, could you keep
it down a little?

288
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:55,945
I'm trying to study.
Uh-huh. Yeah.

289
00:11:56,013 --> 00:11:57,947
Here's your breakfast.

290
00:11:58,015 --> 00:12:00,416
Not a good time!

291
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:02,585
Mom, is
something wrong?

292
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:05,588
Would it be so bad
to turn out like me?!

293
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:08,391
Mom, I admire everything you do.

294
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,226
But it's not good
enough, is it?

295
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:12,061
It's plenty good.
It's great!

296
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:13,329
It's just...

297
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:15,064
not for me.

298
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:18,901

School bus!

299
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:23,473

(disgruntledly):
Mwa.

301
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,544
What kind of kiss did <i>you</i> get?
Normal. You?

302
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:29,646
Ice-cold.

303
00:12:29,713 --> 00:12:31,214
You're just
imagining things.

304
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:33,149
Oh, yeah?

Ta-dah!

309
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:45,960
Ugh! What's the point
of getting rid of all

310
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:48,663

I have to do my learning here?
