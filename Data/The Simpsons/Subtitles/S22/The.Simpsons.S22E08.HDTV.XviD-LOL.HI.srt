Aah!

00:00:15,672 --> 00:00:17,806
Wrong holiday, stupid.

Ho, ho, ho!

10
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:28,050
I could use some help!

11
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:32,621
Marge, I'm watching a rerun
of an important bowl game.

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,623
ANNOUNCER: And that last
touchdown makes it 67 to 13.

00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:36,058
Maggie!

14
00:00:36,126 --> 00:00:38,627
Lisa, what
are you doing?

15
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:40,596
Marking a crime scene.

16
00:00:40,663 --> 00:00:42,664
To celebrate
an ancient pagan ritual,

17
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:44,233
this tree was cut down

18
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,802
and tarted up like a
dime-a-dance floozy.

19
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,004
Oh...

20
00:00:49,072 --> 00:00:51,840
Next you'll have a problem
with my gingerbread house.

21
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:53,575
You mean
your gingerbread McMansion.

22
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,046
Hey, show some respect.

23
00:00:58,114 --> 00:01:01,150
Three gingerbread workmen
died making that.

24
00:01:01,217 --> 00:01:04,419
I'm sorry,
but this leg's gonna have to go.

25
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:08,557
You're gonna be okay.

26
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,926
It's almost over.

27
00:01:10,994 --> 00:01:12,661
Now to take care
of the witnesses.

28
00:01:13,863 --> 00:01:16,798
Hey, I need those
cookies for Santa.

29
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:21,270
At least someone around here's
got the Christmas spirit.

30
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,438
Yep. Come midnight,
I'll be sitting here

31
00:01:23,506 --> 00:01:27,209
with cold cookies,
warm milk, and hot lead.

32
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:28,911
What...?
For the last three years,

33
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:31,880
I've asked that rosy-cheeked
nog-hog for a dirt bike,

34
00:01:31,948 --> 00:01:34,283
and all he brought me
was a zillion lame-o toys

35
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,685
that I immediately broke
and threw in this bag.

36
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:39,821
(screeches)

37
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:42,357
But you wanted those toys.

38
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:44,526
I wanted them
till I got them.

39
00:01:44,594 --> 00:01:48,230
But this year,
I'm gettin' my dirt bike.

40
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:51,800
Even Mac Davis himself
couldn't save this Christmas.

41
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:54,336
Great, Mom. Now I lost track
of my pump count.

42
00:01:54,404 --> 00:01:55,704
One pump, two pump...

43
00:01:55,772 --> 00:01:57,873

00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:16,792

Yep, she'll fly, all right.

59
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:36,144

After NAFTA, a lot of these

79
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,817
Well, who needs
wrapping paper, anyway?

80
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:51,019
Just stick a bow on the toy

Well, let me ask you this.

104
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:57,319
How many kids bring
a gun to meet Santa?

105
00:04:57,387 --> 00:04:58,920
Okay. You got me.

106
00:04:58,988 --> 00:05:00,856
And I'm gettin' my dirt bike.
And you can't stop me.

107

No disrespect, fat man,

110
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:23,845
but you'd better
crap out a dirt bike.

111
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:25,480
Close the door, boy.

112
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:27,549
I can't afford to heat
the whole North Pole!

113
00:05:31,387 --> 00:05:32,921
Listen here, Kringle.

114
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:34,423
I may have
been naughty this year.

115
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,425
But by today's standards,
naughty's nothing.

116
00:05:36,492 --> 00:05:37,626
I didn't get
anybody pregnant.

117
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:39,027
I didn't Facebook
a kid to death.

118

00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,731
Kid, this company's bust.

120
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:44,866
For years I've been
giving out free toys

121
00:05:44,934 --> 00:05:46,668
and getting
cookies in return.

122
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:49,404

business model.

123

124
00:05:50,706 --> 00:05:52,140

125
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,942

131
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,953

be a nice pair

under your tree.

00:06:07,123 --> 00:06:08,557
You don't have
to do that.

134
00:06:08,624 --> 00:06:10,959
I have socks.
I'll give you socks!

135

head home.

Well, instead, I grew this tree.

177
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:07,263
Don't dare bring that
thing in here.

178
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,365
What? You don't want
a Christmas tree?

179
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:10,599
That's crazy.

180
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,401
Next you won't want
a Christmas ham.

181
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:13,903
Don't worry about that.

182
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,839
I love meat and I always will.

183
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:20,810
Mm-mm! That is
some sweet pig meat.

184
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:23,379
But as for Christmas trees,
I used to love them,

185
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:24,747
until last year...

186
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:29,985
This tree reminds me
of your father.

187
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:32,488
It's round in the middle,
thinning on top,

188
00:08:32,556 --> 00:08:35,191
and your hands get sticky
when you touch it.

189
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:37,059
Simpson, you're shipping
out tonight.

190
00:08:37,127 --> 00:08:39,045
Right before Christmas?

191
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:41,530
Hitler doesn't
take a holiday.

192
00:08:41,598 --> 00:08:43,466
Well, he does, but he
doesn't tell people

193
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:45,935
till the last minute,
so they can't make plans.

194
00:08:46,002 --> 00:08:47,470
Bastard.

195
00:08:47,537 --> 00:08:48,337
MARGE:
But I... oh...

196
00:08:53,877 --> 00:08:57,146
So I never want to see
another Christmas tree

197
00:08:57,214 --> 00:09:00,483
until Mom comes back,
safe and sound.

198
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,817
(sniffs and sobs)

199
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:03,452
Sweetie, if your mother
was in trouble,

200
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,688
they'd tell us as
soon as they could.

201
00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:07,223
Telegram!
D'oh!

202
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:13,229
Marge is Mia?

203
00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:14,363
Oh, my God!

204
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:16,332
She changed her name!

205
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,568
No, that says she's
missing in action.

206
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:20,970
(sobbing):
Oh, no!

207
00:09:21,037 --> 00:09:23,272
See?

208
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,809
Every time we get
a tree, Mom disappears.

209
00:09:26,877 --> 00:09:29,278
Why couldn't it have been me?
It still could be.

210
00:09:29,346 --> 00:09:31,680
You just have to go down to
the recruiting station and--

211
00:09:31,748 --> 00:09:32,882
Shut up.

212
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,584
(sniffling)

213
00:09:37,854 --> 00:09:39,421
(sniffling)

214
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:43,025
Huh?

215
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,564
(gasps)
Oh, no!

216
00:09:48,632 --> 00:09:50,766
This is where
they took Mom from me.

217
00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:54,870
(screams)

218
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:56,739
(ominous tone):
I've been waiting for you.

219
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,509
(cheerful voice):
Your mom paid for this tree

220
00:10:00,577 --> 00:10:02,478
last year, but never took it.

221
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:03,879
I've watered it,
kept it fresh,

222
00:10:03,947 --> 00:10:06,715
and every time
I look at this blue spruce,

223
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:08,484
it reminds me
of your good old mom.

224
00:10:08,552 --> 00:10:10,336
Here, let me trim it for you.

225
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:14,757
And decorate it a little.

226
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:19,395
It's a sign. Mom's okay.

227
00:10:19,462 --> 00:10:22,398
Thank you.

228
00:10:22,465 --> 00:10:25,301
Yeah. My only sale all year
and it's not even a sale.

229
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,304
Whose turn is it to cry?

230
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:30,306
Yours.

231
00:10:30,373 --> 00:10:33,142
(wailing, sobbing)

232
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,012
Quit your bellyaching about
Marge and let me read the paper.

233
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,113
HOMER (gasps):
Look at that picture!

234
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:40,316
(both sobbing, wailing)

235
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:44,820
Oh, for cryin' out loud.

236
00:10:47,224 --> 00:10:48,557
Huh?

237
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,826
I thought you said you
didn't want a tree.

238
00:10:50,894 --> 00:10:53,796
Yes, but then I learned that
there's always hope.

239
00:10:53,864 --> 00:10:56,265
Someday this war will be over.

240
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,234
Someday our mom will be back.

241
00:10:58,301 --> 00:11:02,338
Someday TV will be invented,
and it will be free.

242
00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:03,606
Then it will cost money.

243
00:11:03,673 --> 00:11:05,274
But until then,
this tree will stand

244
00:11:05,342 --> 00:11:07,176
for everything Mom believes in:

245
00:11:07,244 --> 00:11:11,013
home, family, and constantly
sweeping up needles.

(postman yelling)

265
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,214
Marge Simpson, I'm on my way.

266
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:26,588
Wake up, Marge.

269
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:32,560
How did you get in here?

270
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:34,262
A picket fence
stood on its end

271
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,064
makes a sturdy
and attractive ladder.

272
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:37,432
Now let's make that bed.

273
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:49,511
A smattering of pinecones.

274
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,312
And with a little bit of work,
this wedding dress

275
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,681
can make a great dust ruffle.

276
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,618
B-But I was gonna--
oh... Ooh!

277
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:02,457
So this stuff will
just shampoo out, huh?

278
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:04,058
Why would you want
to shampoo it out?

279
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:06,761
(Bart and Milhouse laughing)

280
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:08,696
Me and Milhouse had
a snowball fight,

281
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,266
then an ice-ball fight,
then a fight-fight.

282
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,835
You boys want to play soldier?

283
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:16,971
I can't think of a better way
to spend Jesus's birthday.

284
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:26,314
I'm not sure I like
where this is going.

285
00:14:26,382 --> 00:14:28,650
Well, I'm not sure anyone
asked your opinion.

286
00:14:35,524 --> 00:14:36,925
(both grunting with effort)

287
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:44,098
Squeeze your shoulder
blades together.

288
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,568
Now march,
and after an hour you can relax

289
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,636
with some hand-shaved hot cocoa

290
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:51,573

Yay!

Soldiers" from <i>The Nutcracker)</i>

293
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:57,078
And out.
Ms. Stewart,

294
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,815
I made a star for the tree
out of discarded water bottles.

295
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:02,784
Lovely, dear, except
I would have soaked

296
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:04,185
the labels off
with warm water.

297
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:05,787
Then I would have
melted the plastic down

298
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:07,155
in the double boiler

299
00:15:07,223 --> 00:15:08,756
and poured it
into a candy mold.

300
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,960
And finally, I wouldn't have
presented it quite so proudly.

301
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:13,561
I'll go outside
and make snow angels.

302
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:15,296
Lie face down

303
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:17,865
and your beautiful smile
will be molded into the snow.

304
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,168
Okay.

305
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:29,577
(Homer snoring)

306
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:32,513
Now this is
a challenge.

307
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:34,782
(orchestral instrumental of
"Carol of the Bells" playing)

308
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:42,523
There, a slumbering hubby

309
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,892

00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:50,732
He's starting
to wake up.

313
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:52,300
A little
of my Hubby's Holiday Helper

314
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,936
will calm him
right down.

315
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:57,038
(concerned sigh)

316
00:15:57,106 --> 00:15:58,740
Don't worry, Marge,
it's a good thing.

317
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:00,875
(anxious wailing)
There, there.

318
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:02,243
Shh...

319
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:04,279
(sighs)

320
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:07,615
Martha, the house
looks beautiful.

321
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:10,551
It's like Christmas with
a childless gay couple.

322
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:11,886
But it's just
not the same

323
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:14,222
without my family
being themselves.

324
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,591
Well, thanks for
wasting my time.

325
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:18,326
I'll just wave my magic wand

326
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,061
and turn everything
back the way it was.

327
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:21,562
You have a magic wand?

328
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,131
Yes, I made it myself.

329
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:25,533
Take an old car antenna,
marinate it overnight

330
00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:28,269
in the tears of a heartbroken
leprechaun, bake at 350

331

00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:32,834
Moe Szyslak,
house sitter extraordinaire.

352
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:34,319
(audience booing)

353
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:36,271
Sticks and stones
may break my bones...

354
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:37,706
Ow! Hey, stop it!

355
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:39,691
Ooh, cookies!

356
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:41,109
(chewing noisily)

357
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,781
Great at the chewing,
not so hot at the swallowing.

358
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:48,650
Now, remember,
pack only necessities.

359
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,189
(Homer laughs
like Kermit the Frog)

360
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:55,657
Hey, baby, it's Moe.

361
00:17:55,725 --> 00:17:57,425
Calling youse
from my new bachelor pad

362
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,512
at 742 Evergreen Terrace.

363
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:04,132
Yeah, okay, sugar plum,
I'll see you soon.

364
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,700
Hey, get this off.
Hey, get this off!

365
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:06,701
(Velcro crackles)

366
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:08,470
(grunts, chuckles)

367
00:18:08,538 --> 00:18:11,606
Now nothing stands between
us and sunny Hawa...

368
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,908
BURNS:
Merry Humbug, everyone.

369
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:14,509
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!

370
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,044
What's wrong, Homie?

371
00:18:16,112 --> 00:18:18,079
I got the week off
by telling Mr. Burns

372
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:19,948
I had a neck injury.

373
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,252
Mr. Burns, why'd you
come to see me?

374
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,789
Well, last night, I had a
visit from three spirits.

375
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,742
I wish this show had a visit
from three new writers.

376
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:32,561
(both laugh)

377
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:34,663
Wait, what's this?

378
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,082
Carpetbags and
portmanteaus?

379
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,700
Going somewhere,
Simpson?

380
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,802
Uh, uh...

381
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,973
Hey, guys, uh, you'll need this
on your trip to Hawaii... aah!

382
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,975
Hmm, your
goblin fainted.

383
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,593
Not a goblin.

384
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:50,545
Simpson,
where's your Christmas tree?

385
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,147
(doorbell rings)
Coming!

386
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,583
FLANDERS: Homer, give me
back my tree!

387
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,853
(both grunting)

388
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,388
(fabric ripping,
Flanders screams)

389
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:07,696
Well, I won't interrupt
your holiday any longer.

390
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,931
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good--

391
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:13,501
pop superstar/fashionista
Katy Perry?!

392
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,403
(audience cheers, applauds)

393
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:21,776
What are you people doing in
my boyfriend Moe's bachelor pad?

394
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:24,296
That's right,
she's into puppets.

395
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,281
Just what's going on here?

396
00:19:26,349 --> 00:19:28,083
Fine, I'll come clean.

397
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,384
(gasps)

398
00:19:29,452 --> 00:19:31,553
It's a Christmas miraculum.

399
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:33,471
No, it's not.

400
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:36,458
I just told a lie
so we could go to Hawaii.

401
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:38,109
You lied to me.

402
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:40,228
Release the hounds.

403
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:43,198
(hounds barking)

404
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,600
(barking stops)

405
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:47,452
Oh, they'll be here
any minute.

406
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:53,174
We, uh, blew the budget
on Katy Perry.

407
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:54,376
(groans):
D'oh.

408
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,277
Someone totally needs a hug.

409
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,217
I kissed a girl
and I liked it.

410
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,172
All is forgiven,
Simpsons.

411
00:20:07,256 --> 00:20:09,975
Go and enjoy "Ha-vah-ee."

412
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:11,760
(cheering)

413
00:20:11,827 --> 00:20:14,396
Just as soon as we sing
one Christmas carol.

414
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,983
Oh, man, not the lame-o
"12 Days of Christmas."

415
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:19,300
Of course not.

416
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:21,036
I want to sing
the original, unabridged

417
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:22,687
"39 Days Of Christmas."

418
00:20:22,772 --> 00:20:24,339
And-a one and-a two...

419
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:26,157

ANNOUNCER:
<i>Tonight's</i> Simpsons <i>episode</i>

431
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,698
<i>was brought to you</i>
<i>by the symbol umlaut</i>

432
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:51,433
<i>and the number e.</i>

433
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,535
<i>Not the letter e,</i>
<i>but the number</i>

434
00:20:53,602 --> 00:20:56,371
<i>whose exponential function</i>
<i>is the derivative of itself.</i>

435
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:59,674
Well, it's been a long run,
but I think this'll kill it.

436
00:20:59,742 --> 00:21:01,343
What, <i>The Simpsons?</i>

437
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,644
No, Christmas.

438
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,045
