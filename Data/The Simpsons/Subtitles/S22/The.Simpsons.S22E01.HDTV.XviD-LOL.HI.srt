16

We're watching the
Nobel Prize announcements

17
00:01:11,294 --> 00:01:12,928
live from Stockholm.

18

(grunting)

20
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:16,231
For Economics...

21
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:19,434
Jagdish Bhagwati.

22
00:01:19,502 --> 00:01:21,703
Huzzah!
I had him in the pool.

23
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:22,838
HOMER:
Lucky.

24
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:24,106
Quiet!

25
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:26,141
It's time for the noblest
Nobel Prize of all:

26
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,776
the Peace Prize.

27
00:01:27,844 --> 00:01:30,045
I would kill for that.

28
00:01:30,113 --> 00:01:33,014
And the Nobel Prize
for Peace goes to...

29
00:01:33,082 --> 00:01:34,116
Isn't this
exciting?

30
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:35,917
Krusty the Clown.

32
00:01:39,922 --> 00:01:43,158
BROCKMAN: And now, to comment
on joining the ranks of

00:01:43,226 --> 00:01:45,127
Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Ghandi, and Desmond Tutu,

34
00:01:45,194 --> 00:01:47,562
here's the man who
always parks in my spot,

35
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,197
Krusty the Clown!

36
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:51,133
I'd just like to say:

37
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,436
this thing is worth
nearly two million dollars.

38
00:01:54,504 --> 00:01:57,506
How do you like me now,
Teen Choice Awards?

39
00:01:57,573 --> 00:02:00,442
Kent Brockman, Channel Six,
and channelsix.com.

40
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,811
Will you be flying
to Norway to accept the prize?

41
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,413
I'm looking forward to
visiting the Arctic Circle,

42
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:07,716
or as I call it,
my wife's side of the bed!

43
00:02:07,784 --> 00:02:09,551
For the purposes of
that joke, I'm married.

All right, all right,
settle down.

54
00:02:38,748 --> 00:02:41,650
Homer, you're the
easiest laugh I know.

55
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:43,285
How easy am I?

56
00:02:43,352 --> 00:02:44,686
Shut up!

57
00:02:44,754 --> 00:02:46,354
I'm gonna need you
in the audience

58
00:02:46,422 --> 00:02:48,623

Peace Prize in Oslo.

59
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:50,058

Can my son come, too?

60
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:52,761
He knows what to do

I never go to Europe
without learning something.

69
00:03:12,648 --> 00:03:15,784
Now listen, I need you two
to hold these for me.

70
00:03:15,852 --> 00:03:17,452
Your drugs
put me to sleep.

71
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,787
Your drugs
wake me up.

72
00:03:18,855 --> 00:03:21,323
If I ask you to give
me more, you say no.

73
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,093
If I ask you again,
you give 'em to me.

74
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:27,329
Why aren't I
going to Oslo?

75
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:29,698
The Nobel Prizes
are my freakin' thing.

76
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:31,499
But no, Bart
gets everything

77
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,501
because he's the oldest,
and he's a boy.

78
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:35,470
And Maggie gets
what's ever left over,

79
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:37,372
because she's the youngest
and she's a baby.

80
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,041
Meanwhile, I just
stand and wave

81
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:41,509
to people going
to better places.

82
00:03:41,577 --> 00:03:44,546
Would half a bottle of
confiscated water cheer you up?

83
00:03:44,614 --> 00:03:45,680
Ew, no thanks.

84
00:03:45,748 --> 00:03:47,682
Oh. Quite the little

86
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:52,520
I'm just gonna chill out with
a little <i>This American Life.</i>

87
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:55,190
I'm Ira Glass. Remember when
you were five years old,

88
00:03:55,258 --> 00:03:56,958
putting ketchup on your hot dog?

89
00:03:57,026 --> 00:03:59,327
Today, in five acts: condiments.

90
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:00,996
Act one, mustard.

91
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:02,864
Act two, mayo.

92
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:04,599
Act three, relish.

93
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:07,102
Act four, corn relish...

94
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:09,237
Mom, this isn't
the way home.

95
00:04:09,305 --> 00:04:11,139
Maybe we're not going
home right away.

96
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:12,741
Oh, I get it.

97
00:04:12,808 --> 00:04:15,610

Where's my Nobel Prize?

170
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,359
There is no prize.

171
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:16,128
It was merely a ruse

172
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:17,729
to get you to Europe,

173
00:07:17,797 --> 00:07:19,765
so we could try you
for the terrible crimes

174
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,366
you've committed
on this continent!

175
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:23,235

176
00:07:23,303 --> 00:07:24,603
You gotta read
me the charges!

177
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,472
You dropped a monkey
from the Eiffel Tower...

178
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:27,739
Uh-huh.

179
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:29,074
In Greece, you committed
something called

180
00:07:29,142 --> 00:07:30,342
"aggravated hey-hey"...

181
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,677
Forgot about
that one.

182
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:33,779
And here in Holland,
you stole the entire act

183
00:07:33,847 --> 00:07:36,448
of our beloved
clown "Van Kru sten."

184
00:07:36,516 --> 00:07:39,451
U bestolen al
mijn jokenchortles!

185
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:43,255
Gaah! Oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute!

186
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:46,158
One of the most
important skills

187
00:07:46,226 --> 00:07:48,994
a performer can learn
is dealing with hecklers.

188
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:50,796
And... action!

189
00:07:50,864 --> 00:07:52,764
Top of the evening,
Officer Krupke.

190
00:07:52,832 --> 00:07:54,600
Your dog's dead!

191
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,101
Um... that's not
really a heckle.

192
00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:58,103
Right, yeah, right.

193
00:07:58,171 --> 00:08:01,773
I've seen more life in the
Wellington Botanic Gardens!

194
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:03,775
That is a heckle,
but if you're not

195
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:05,711
from New Zealand,
it loses some of its sting.

196
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:07,012
How much?
Well, most of it.

197
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,680
Do you think they
won't know the reference?

198
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:10,415
If they did
know the Gardens,

199
00:08:10,483 --> 00:08:13,385
then they would know that
they're teeming with life.

200
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:14,953
So, what do
you guys do

201
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:16,822
when you're not
camp counselors?

202
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,757
We're highly
successful artists.

203
00:08:18,825 --> 00:08:20,125
And as artists, we live in

204
00:08:20,193 --> 00:08:21,159
Springfield's most
artistic borough...

205
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:22,528
Sprooklyn.

206
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:24,530
(impressed murmurs)

207
00:08:24,597 --> 00:08:26,565
We spend our days
acting and painting...

208
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:27,466
dancing and sculpting...

209
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:29,601
playing my Gibson...

210
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:30,736
rehearsing my Ibsen.

211
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:32,371

I am really, really sorry

241
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:40,272
for everything
I've been charged with

242
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,941
and all the stuff
you don't know about yet.

243
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:44,309
There is only
one possible way

00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:45,344
to earn your freedom.

245
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:47,746
Oh, I get it.

246
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:52,184
Everyone's windmill needs
a new blade now and then, right?

247
00:09:52,251 --> 00:09:55,621
No! Our windmills are
the envy of the world!

248
00:09:55,688 --> 00:09:57,389
(low grunt)

249
00:09:57,457 --> 00:10:00,058
To win exoneration, you must
prove that you have made

250
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:03,495
a singular contribution
to Western culture.

251
00:10:03,563 --> 00:10:04,730
Western, huh?

252
00:10:04,797 --> 00:10:06,565
Did you ever see
my "Wyatt Burp" sketch?

253
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:09,401
Everyone on my payroll
says it's great.

254
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:12,137
I am not familiar
with this "Wyatt Burp."

255
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:13,939
Oh, uh...
then, uh...

256
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:16,074
Let me do my "Dutch Oven" bit!

257
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:17,776
It's about other Dutchmen,
not you.

258
00:10:17,844 --> 00:10:19,811
(chuckles weakly)
You know, uh...

259
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:26,184
AIESHA: Those clouds look like
a casting director saying,

260
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:27,552
"You've got the part."

261
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,954
That cloud
looks like legendary

262
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:31,657
Broadway lyricist
Betty Comden.

263
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:34,559
I finally found
the place I belong.

264
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:36,928
You're week's up.
Time to go home!

265
00:10:36,996 --> 00:10:39,131
(stunned gasp)
It can't be Saturday already.

266
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:40,799
Monday was orientation.

267
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:43,201
Tuesday, we did mime.

268
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:45,003
Wednesday we did <i>Mame.</i>

269
00:10:45,071 --> 00:10:47,139
Thursday we got
attacked by bees.

270
00:10:47,206 --> 00:10:49,074
Friday morning, Andrew Lloyd
Webber and Elaine Stritch

271
00:10:49,142 --> 00:10:50,242
helped us make wallets.

272
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:51,910
Friday evening, we performed

273
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:54,413
<i>Angels in America: A Gay</i>
<i>Fantasia on National Themes.</i>

274
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,181
<i>Part One: Millennium</i>
<i>Approaches.</i>

275
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:57,182
<i>Part Two...</i>

276
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,517
<i>Perestroika?</i>

277
00:10:58,584 --> 00:10:59,751
That's right!

278
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:01,420
Strike the set,
pizza party,

279
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:02,921
Saturday morning,
and then... (gasps)

280
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:04,790
No!

281
00:11:04,857 --> 00:11:06,725
Good-bye, Lisa.

282
00:11:06,793 --> 00:11:09,961
I'll miss you a lot, then a
little, then not too much.

283
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:13,532
(strumming folk chords)
Lisa, do you have
to leave this minute?

284
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:15,233
No time.

285
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:18,136
I don't want to get stuck behind
the joggers from the fat camp.

286
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:19,905
(joggers panting,
horns honking)

287
00:11:22,075 --> 00:11:23,675
(tires squealing,
engine roaring)

288
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:25,477
I can't go home.

289
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:28,547
Something happened this week
that completely changed me.

290
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:31,616
Oh, you didn't see a boy lose
his swim trunks, did you?

291
00:11:31,684 --> 00:11:33,085
No.

292
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:35,687
I fell in love with theater,
dance, and song.

293
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:38,323
We've got plenty
of songs in the car,

294
00:11:38,391 --> 00:11:40,459

favorite singer: Roofi.

What's the matter, Lisa?

306
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:12,270
You're usually the first
one out of this death trap.

307
00:12:12,337 --> 00:12:15,339
Well, the combination
of me leaving arts camp

308
00:12:15,407 --> 00:12:17,208
and you driving
on and off the shoulder

309
00:12:17,276 --> 00:12:18,810
has made me a little ill.

310
00:12:18,877 --> 00:12:21,345
Sorry. I guess I shouldn't be
playing this driving game

311
00:12:21,413 --> 00:12:22,713
while I'm driving.

312
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:24,615
(tires squealing)

313
00:12:24,683 --> 00:12:26,918
(screaming)

314
00:12:26,985 --> 00:12:29,687
Okay, maybe it won't
be that bad.

315
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:32,824
Hey Lisa, how
was farts camp?

316
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:34,892
(laughing)
Farts camp--
that's great.

317
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,094
Arts camp was lovely.

318
00:12:37,162 --> 00:12:40,865
Did you paint a picture
on toilet paper?

319
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:42,567
(laughing)

320
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:45,803
(playing "My Country
'Tis of Thee" slowly & off-key)

321
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:56,881
(playing up-tempo jazz solo)

322
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,718
Lisa Simpson, please stick

323
00:13:00,786 --> 00:13:03,154
to the illegally
Xeroxed sheet music.

324
00:13:03,222 --> 00:13:06,390
But arts camp encouraged us
to spread our wings and fly.

325
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,826
Lisa, I went to arts camp, too.

326
00:13:08,894 --> 00:13:10,828
And all it does
is fill your coconut

327
00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:13,364
with banana-cream dreams
that can never come true.

328
00:13:13,432 --> 00:13:14,565
How do you cope?

329
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,033
(whimpers)

330
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:18,803

00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,667
Krusty's made
a cultural contribution.

336
00:13:41,735 --> 00:13:43,202
Let's see what
we've got here.

337
00:14:01,836 --> 00:14:03,136
Ah, here we are--

338
00:14:04,972 --> 00:14:09,809
Top to bottom, left to right,
readin' things is outta sight.

339
00:14:09,877 --> 00:14:12,679
Speaking of out of sight,
you've gotta hide me.

340
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:16,049
I slept with the lighting
director's wife, and...

341
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:18,418
(funky jazz playing)

342
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,381
(noisy chewing, smacking)

343
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:33,116
No appetite, honey?

344
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:36,052
It's just dinner
conversation at arts camp

345
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,954
was a bit more stimulating.

346
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:40,724
One night we spoke only
in lines from famous poems.

347
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,626
Because I could
not stop for death,

348
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:44,961
he kindly stopped for me.

349
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:46,529
Emily Dickinson.

350
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:48,231
No, I was just
describing my day.

351
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:49,799
(sighs)

352
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:53,803
If you need me, I'll be upstairs
saying good-bye to my dreams.

353
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:56,973
My dream is to be able
to walk up stairs

354
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,342
like an eight-year-old girl.
(moans)

355
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:08,251
Maggie, your
big sister is leaving

356
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:10,453
for a more
artistic life.

357
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:11,955
I'll send for you
when I'm famous.

358
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:14,524
We'll take the town by storm,
like the Bronte sisters.

359
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,399
Oh, Maggie, don't ever turn two.

360
00:15:26,003 --> 00:15:29,005
("Rhapsody in Blue" playing)

361
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:42,496
(car alarms blaring)

362
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:46,563
Aha!

363
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:53,136
(panting)

364
00:15:55,173 --> 00:15:57,007
(whimpers nervously)

365
00:15:58,343 --> 00:15:59,409
Lisa Simpson.

366
00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:01,144
What are you doing here?

367
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:03,046
I came to share in the esteem

368
00:16:03,114 --> 00:16:05,015
that the world bestows
on its artists.

369
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:07,651
Uh, yeah.

370
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,220
Brrr!

371
00:16:10,288 --> 00:16:12,856
Boy, it sure is
cold in here.
No heat.

372
00:16:12,924 --> 00:16:14,691
It's, uh, part of our art.

373
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:15,692
(two gunshots)

374
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,027
(man groaning)

375
00:16:17,095 --> 00:16:18,228
More art.

376
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:20,063
Ethan, look what
I stole from work.

377
00:16:20,131 --> 00:16:21,398
Yes!

378
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:22,432
Tomatoes?

379
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,134
What kind of artists are you?

380
00:16:24,202 --> 00:16:26,002
Sandwich artists.
But we get to eat

381
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,738
any sandwiches we
drop on the floor.

382
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:29,306
Unless we drop
them on purpose.

383
00:16:29,374 --> 00:16:31,408
They've got cameras
on us at all times.

384
00:16:31,476 --> 00:16:33,543
Are you saying
that arts camp was a lie?

385
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:35,178
Well, not the swimming.

386
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:38,348

CHIEF MAGISTRATE:
<i>Herschel Krustofsky,</i>

405
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:29,466
you stand accused of
the most heinous crimes

406
00:17:29,534 --> 00:17:30,934
known to clowndom.

407
00:17:31,002 --> 00:17:32,969
Have you anything to say
in your defense?

408
00:17:33,037 --> 00:17:34,304
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

409
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:35,839
I've led a worthless life.

410
00:17:35,907 --> 00:17:38,141
I've been this way
since I was a little...

411
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:39,176
squirt!

412
00:17:39,243 --> 00:17:41,077
Heh? Heh?

413
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:44,848
Come on, I thought you
Euro-jerks loved unfunny comedy.

414
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,017
We don't put "Euro"
in front of everything.

415
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:48,285
Euro-guards!

416
00:17:48,352 --> 00:17:49,786
Take him away
in Euro-cuffs.

417
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:53,557
Wait! Not so fast!

418
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:55,959
We found something
to save Krusty!

419
00:17:56,027 --> 00:17:57,928
And it's on this DVD.

420
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,696
Is it region one or region two?

421
00:17:59,764 --> 00:18:01,798
Uh, what region is America?

422
00:18:01,866 --> 00:18:02,632
Region one.

423
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,733
Woo-hoo!

424
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:04,768
(chanting):
We're region one!

425
00:18:04,836 --> 00:18:05,936
We're region one!

426
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,537
Well, this is
region two,

427
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:09,406
so I'm afraid your
exculpatory evidence

428
00:18:09,474 --> 00:18:11,842
will produce nothing more
than an error message

429
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:13,643
stating
"unreadable disc."

430
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:14,911
If it please
the court,

431
00:18:14,979 --> 00:18:17,581
my brother has a
multi-region player.

432
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:20,283
I just pray he's not
on a state-mandated

433
00:18:20,351 --> 00:18:21,651

437
00:18:30,161 --> 00:18:33,530
Get this back
to me by 6:00.

438
00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:37,200
I'm having a <i>Real Housewives</i>
<i>of Atlanta</i> season two party.

439
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:43,540
My dressing room has
<i>regular</i> potato chips,

440
00:18:43,608 --> 00:18:45,642
but my contract
specifically stated

441
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,677
half regular, half ruffled!

442
00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:48,778
Krusty, please...

443
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:50,447
Forget it! Forget it!

444
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:51,681
The gig's off!

445
00:18:51,749 --> 00:18:53,350
I ain't gonna play Sun City.

446
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,318
Vuvuzela me out of here.

447
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:59,723
(vuvuzelas blowing)

448
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,491
Three days later,

449
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,060
South Africa freed
Nelson Mandela from prison.

450
00:19:04,128 --> 00:19:07,330
Krusty the Klown, your
selfishness has saved the world.

451
00:19:07,398 --> 00:19:08,498
Case dismissed.

452
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:11,902
I'm just glad you
all finally saw

453
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:14,237
what an amazing
human being I am.

454
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:15,906
Now, where's the
nearest place

455
00:19:15,973 --> 00:19:17,941
I can score a little
victory weed?

456
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:19,543
That would be the
courthouse cafeteria.

457
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,877
I'll be right there.

458
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:22,779
Order me, um,
a raspberry crepe

459
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:24,481
and a brick of hash.

460
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:26,049
How do you smoke it?

461
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:28,718
I melt it and inject
it into my eyelid.

462
00:19:28,786 --> 00:19:30,320
Hey, you're all right.

482
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:16,366

surprise for your trip back.

483
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:17,634
Is it your laundry?

Yeah, well,
obviously,

488
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:27,444
