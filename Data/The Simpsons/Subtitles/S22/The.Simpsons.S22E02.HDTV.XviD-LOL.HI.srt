certainly afford...

86
00:05:11,474 --> 00:05:13,875

doesn't mean that

problems, Chief.

179
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:14,582
I'm in love with
the don's daughter!

180
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,684
But which me
does <i>she</i> love?

181
00:09:16,752 --> 00:09:17,619
(mutters):
I don't know.

182
00:09:19,722 --> 00:09:22,991
LISA:
Hmm...

183
00:09:23,058 --> 00:09:25,059
Thank you so much
for clicking on me.

184
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:27,295
I am Muhammad Yunus,
founder of the Grameen Bank,

185
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:30,498
and, oh yeah, I'm also the
winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.

186
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:35,236
To find an entrepreneur you want
to lend to, click on my nose...

187
00:09:35,304 --> 00:09:36,571
if you can catch it.

188
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,805
It's up here!

189
00:09:37,873 --> 00:09:38,940
Now down here!

190
00:09:39,008 --> 00:09:40,108
Too slow!
(laughs)

191
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:41,175
Okay, I'll hold still.

192
00:09:41,243 --> 00:09:42,243
No, I won't.

193
00:09:42,311 --> 00:09:43,478
Ha-ha!
Got it!

194
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:45,313
YUNUS:
<i>Good-bye!</i>

195
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:47,148
Let's see, I could help someone

196
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:49,150
in any impoverished
area on Earth.

197
00:09:49,218 --> 00:09:50,418
Bangladesh.

198
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:51,786
Bolivia.

199
00:09:51,854 --> 00:09:54,555
(gasps)
East Springfield?

200
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:00,962
My name is Nelson Mandela Muntz.

201
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,863
Nelson?

202
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,197
And my dream is

203
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:05,266
to make and market
custom bicycles.

204
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:08,069
Nelson! My dream is
to make enough money

205
00:10:08,137 --> 00:10:12,040
so's I can get the rest
of this tattoo removed.

206
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:14,275
Sorry I wasted your time.

207
00:10:14,343 --> 00:10:17,512
No fool would take a chance
on a loser like me.

208
00:10:19,448 --> 00:10:22,850
I will. I'll take a chance
on you, Nelson Muntz.

209
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:27,355
Nelson, I gotta
take this computer
to the pawn shop,

210
00:10:27,423 --> 00:10:29,791
so's we can get
White Castle for
your birthday.

211
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,996
So, Nelson, I
see you started
a small business.

212
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:40,431
Yeah.

213
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:42,533
Some anonymous dude
sent me 50 bucks.

214
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,536
Probably someone cool like
Famous Amos or Ba Ba Booey.

215
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,972
And I'm gonna justify
his faith in me.

216
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,875
Well, whoever your
mysterious donor is,

217
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:54,512
he, or she, <i>really</i>
wants you to succeed.

218
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:55,546
Ding-dong!

219
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,448
Ooh, your
first customer!

220
00:10:57,516 --> 00:10:59,317
Be nice.
Right. Nice.

221
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:01,352
Good day, Mr. Barf-Breath.

222
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,953
Good day to you.

223
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:06,657
Let me be frank:
Everyone thinks you're a wuss.

224
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:08,859
So, we'll change
the pink to black,

225
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,261
elevate the seat--

226
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:11,729
trust me, it's slimming--

227
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:15,199
and change this wicker
basket to no basket.

228
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:17,835
Do you like it?
(chuckling):
Oh, I love it!

229
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:20,137
Hmm!
Hmm!

230
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:22,440
Wow, my first job.

231
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:25,443
Tonight I'm having
peanut butter <i>and</i> jelly.

232
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,778
No more PB <i>or</i> J for me.

233
00:11:27,846 --> 00:11:29,146
(giggling)

234
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:35,886
(sotto voce):
Stay cool, Marge.
Stay cool.

235
00:11:35,954 --> 00:11:37,788
(takes deep breath)

236
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:40,157
I'd like to return this handbag.

237
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:41,192
Unused.

238
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:43,127
I believe this stranger!

239
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,568
Well, here's your refund.

240
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,003
(sighs)

241
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:57,108
(chuckles)

242
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,744
Check and mate.

243
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:01,245
Thank God!

244
00:12:01,313 --> 00:12:03,347
I will never do that again.

245
00:12:03,415 --> 00:12:04,849
Wait a minute, Marge.

246
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,051
Don't you realize
what just happened?

247
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:09,787
You got to enjoy that bag
for nothing!

248
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,555
We can buy stuff
we can't afford,

249
00:12:11,623 --> 00:12:13,424
temporarily own
the hell out of it,

250
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:16,527
and then indignantly bring
it back for a full refund.

251
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:17,528
(chuckling)

252
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:19,597
Hide a sandwich in this hat.

253
00:12:19,664 --> 00:12:22,166
"Mary Poppins" myself to work
with this umbrella.

254
00:12:22,234 --> 00:12:25,136
Homie, you know what happens
when you push your luck...

255
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,371
Yeah, the luck
lasts longer!

256
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:31,142
Thanks to the power of returns,
this store is our closet!

257
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,510
(booming laugh)

258
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:34,278
(worried murmur)

259
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:37,014
Ooh, a message
from my small business person!

260
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:38,215
(giggles)

261
00:12:38,283 --> 00:12:40,317
Dear anonymous investor:

262
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,020
Here is my update
on my small business.

263
00:12:43,088 --> 00:12:45,189
(excitedly):
I'm making money fist over face!

264
00:12:45,257 --> 00:12:46,657
Dingus!

265
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,659
Great timing!

266
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,361
Awesome!

267
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:53,964
No way I can look nerdy
on this bike.

268
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:56,834
♪ Hot cross buns,
hot cross buns ♪

269
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,636
♪ One a penny, two a penny ♪

270
00:12:58,703 --> 00:13:00,304
♪ Hot cross buns. ♪

271
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:02,640
And, with the money I'm making,

272
00:13:02,707 --> 00:13:05,142
<i>I can treat my mom</i>
<i>the way she deserves!</i>

273
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,978
This place is so fancy, Nelson.

274
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:10,981
The ketchup packets
are made of glass.

275
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:12,783
(humming)

276
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:14,919
NELSON: Ma, please.
You're not at work.

277
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:19,390
(doorbell ringing)

278
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,759
Come in. Come in.

279
00:13:21,827 --> 00:13:24,628
Don't wipe
your feet.

280
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:26,530
Whoa, look at
all this stuff!

281
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,766
Did you find a mouse
head in your Cuppa-Soup?

282
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:30,468
I wish. (chuckles)

283
00:13:30,535 --> 00:13:32,303
(gasps)
What the hell are you doing?!

284
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,505
With this protective plastic
overlay, I can't tell

285
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:37,875
if I'm watching an old <i>Seinfeld</i>
or an old <i>Old Christine.</i>

286
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:40,244
Now, everyone
onto the hot tub.

287
00:13:40,312 --> 00:13:42,680
(humming to himself)

288
00:13:42,747 --> 00:13:44,548
(grunting)

289
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,217
Come on on.

290
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,718
The cardboard's fine.

291
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,520
(chuckles)

292
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:51,055
Hi, Nelson.

293
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,023
Here again, huh, Lis?

294
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:55,092
I guess now
that I'm a success,

295
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,228
you want to get
back together with me.

296
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,230
Dolph called it.

297
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:02,266
No, but there is something
I can't hold back anymore.

298
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:04,602
I'm your microfinance donor!

299
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:07,004
You're L-Simpson-Jazzgirl?

300
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:08,439
Oh, my God.

301
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:09,740
I owe you everything.

302
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,842
Well, I didn't do this
for thanks,

303
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,677
but if you want
to thank me,

304
00:14:13,745 --> 00:14:16,814
I can stand here and listen
for as long as it takes.

305
00:14:16,882 --> 00:14:18,115
I'm sure
you can.

306
00:14:18,183 --> 00:14:19,817
Lisa, if it weren't for you,

307
00:14:19,885 --> 00:14:22,286
I never would have achieved
the kind of success

308
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:24,455
that has allowed me
to quit school.

309
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:26,223
You're quitting school?!

310
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,792
Dropping it like a melon
off an overpass.

311
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,662
But don't you know that people
who don't go to college

312
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,764
make three percent less
than people who do?

313
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,332
Lisa, thanks to you,

314
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,234
and Nobel laureate
Mohammad Yunus,

315
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:39,870
I can do... this!

316
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:43,974
Spelling, meet F-Y-R-E.

317
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:45,175
(gasps, shudders)

318
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:50,123
Principal Skinner,
I need to convince Nelson

319
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,758
to come back to school.

320
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,526
Seriously? Why?
With Nelson gone,

321
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:56,262
lunch money's finally making
its way to the cafeteria.

322
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,198
Nurples are returning to
their natural, non-purple hue.

323
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:02,735
Besides, I hear he's doing quite
well with his bicycle pimpery.

324
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:06,472
He is. He's paying people
$11 an hour to work for him.

325
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,974
$11 an hour?

326
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:09,442
That's night watchman money.

327
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,778
Maybe I should have
a chat with him.

328
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:14,147
Which of these ties
says confidence?

329
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,782
Isn't that a Christmas tie?

330
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,116
It's a conversation starter!

331
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:18,918
Lisa, this conversation is over.

332
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,187
It's not you I'm trying
to impress, it's Nelson.

333
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,322
I know
he likes the sleeveless look.

334
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,857
CHALMERS:
Skinner!

335
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:29,696
Oh. Oh, so you also heard
about the, uh, $11 an hour.

336
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,431
I heard about it first.

337
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:34,634
Yes, well, you see
the thing about that is... Blah!

338
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,604
(humming to himself)

339
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:40,139
Good afternoon.

340
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:42,175
I'd like to return
this merchandise.

341
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:45,344
"Wrong size, wrong color,
not asictured,

342
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:48,114
and other reason
please explain."

343
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,685
Sir, this suitcase has
an airline tag on it,

344
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:54,787
these ping-pong balls have
been served and volleyed,

345
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:56,189
and this hot
plate's still warm.

346
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,623
(hissing)

347
00:15:57,691 --> 00:16:00,793
Yes, uh... maybe
I'll just come back

348
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:02,361
during someone else's shift.

349
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,963
Is Claire working today?

350
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,398
She's a real sucker.

351
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:08,067
Let me get my supervisor.

352
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:11,070
Hello, Homer.
(gasps) How do you
know my name?

353
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:14,507
I'm Chris Hansen
from <i>To Catch a Credit-Whore.</i>

354
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:17,276
We know you've been returning
used items all over town.

355
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,512
(chuckles):
Oh, it's not what you think...

356
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,949
I came here to warn them-- yes,
to-to warn them about, um...

357
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:26,052
People like you?
Yes! I mean no!
I mean...

358
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,787
(shrieks)
You'll never get me!

359
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,592
I have to sign a release so
you can broadcast this, right?

360
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:38,498
Initial there,
and... Never!

361
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,933
Can you tell me when
this is gonna be on?

362
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,268
I'm thinking
of having a party.

363
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,910
Lisa, why did you
bring me here?

364
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:52,445
Oh, I don't know.

365
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,180
I thought one
of these super-successful people

366
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:56,783
might tell you how important
it is to stay in school.

367
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,887
Why, look. It's Mark Zuckerberg,
the founder of Facebook!

368
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,723
Mr. Zuckerberg, I'm Lisa,

369
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,091
and this is Nelson.

370
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:06,592
S'up, Zuck?

371
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,060
"Mark Zuckerberg is...

372
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,630
happy to meet new friends."

373
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,732
That's great,
Mr. Zuckerberg,

374
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,500
but I was hoping
you could tell us

375
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:17,970
how education was
instrumental to your success.

376
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,807
Well, the truth is...
I dropped out of Harvard.

377
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,209
You did?
Better earnin'
than learnin'!

378
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:25,545
Hell, yeah! I'll get
the best kind of degree--

379
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,246
honorary, baby!

380
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:29,849
Well, clearly,
you're an exception.

381
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:32,852
Am I, Lisa?
Bill Gates-- dropout.

382
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,354
Virgin Airlines'
Richard Branson-- dropout.

383
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:39,158
Well... didn't anybody here stay
in school?

384
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,894
MAN:
I did. Graduated
magna cum lade.

385
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,463
There, you see?

386
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:45,932
I'm afraid

387
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,834
I haven't done
too well for myself.

388
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,670
But I can certainly appreciate
the irony of it.

389
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,540
(playful grunting
and laughter)

390
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:03,811
So, how did everyone do
with their $50?

391
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:05,696
Well, I learned
a valuable lesson

392
00:18:05,764 --> 00:18:07,665
about wanting more
than I could afford.

393
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:09,133
Marge, you couldn't have fun

394
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:11,535
if you were a monkey
on a banana boat!

395
00:18:11,603 --> 00:18:14,305
I used Grampa's money
to try to help someone in need,

396
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:16,307
but it didn't go the way
I expected.

397
00:18:16,374 --> 00:18:19,477
Aw, sweetie, money
can't change people.

398
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:21,812
It can just help them
be who they are.

399
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,447
I gave a bum a dollar once,

400
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:26,784
and he used it to buy
an Ellery Queen mystery.

401
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:29,854
But there was one mystery
Ellery Queen couldn't solve--

402
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:32,523
why a man was named Ellery.

403
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:34,391
But my point is,

404
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:38,562
whatever I said before I started
talking about Ellery Queen.

405
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:45,102
Nelson, I just wanted to say
that I realize now

406
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:49,840
you can't be anyone else other
than who you are, and... Huh?

407
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:53,577
Look, everyone,
just chill out!

408
00:18:53,645 --> 00:18:55,513
My <i>Wizard of Oz</i> bike
fell apart

409
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,214
in the middle
of the Pride parade!

410
00:18:57,282 --> 00:18:58,783
What kind of pride?

411
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,318
Never you mind what kind!
Fix my bike!

412
00:19:01,386 --> 00:19:03,454
I want my money back!

413
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:06,791
Fine. Here's exactly
what you paid me.

414
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:08,325
Thank you!

415
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:11,428
Oh! Why is this happening?

416
00:19:11,496 --> 00:19:15,032
Uh, this epoxy you've been using
is water soluble,

417
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,368
which means it's not
weather-resistant.

418
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:19,170
Dumb it down for me.

419
00:19:19,237 --> 00:19:23,274
Um... bike... sticky...
water go bye-bye?

420
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:25,776
Some sticky water stay-stay?

421
00:19:25,844 --> 00:19:26,911
All bye-bye.

422
00:19:26,978 --> 00:19:29,346
Oh!
Hi, Nelson.

423
00:19:29,414 --> 00:19:31,982
Lisa, I've been
thinking and...
(metal clanking)

424
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:35,419
It fell apart when I was trying
to impress this cute girl.

425
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:37,154
My gramma!

426
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:39,490
Maybe I could use a
little more school.

427
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:40,958
You can't
break us up.

428
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:42,393
We're like a
family here.

429
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,361
Kearney and I are
having brunch on Sunday.

430
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:45,896
If I'm up.

431
00:19:45,964 --> 00:19:48,332
Listen, what say
we go back to the school?

432
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,236
I'll help you out with a little
micro-financing of my own.

433
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:55,206
$50! I can buy paint
for the art class,

434
00:19:55,273 --> 00:19:57,708
instead of those crushed-up
berries I find in the woods.

435
00:19:57,776 --> 00:20:00,845
And Lisa, I've got a little left
that I'd like to spend on you.

436
00:20:00,912 --> 00:20:02,246
(organ playing waltz)

437
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:03,781
(giggling)

438
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:06,217
This is really fun.

439
00:20:06,284 --> 00:20:08,118
But we're still just
friends, right?

440
00:20:08,186 --> 00:20:09,687
Right. Friends.

441
00:20:09,754 --> 00:20:12,056
Can I hold your hand...
for balance?

442
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:14,124
Sure... for balance.

443
00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:17,728
(smooching)

444
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:19,663
(squeals)
Haw-haw!

445
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:21,065
Sorry.

446
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:22,700
Haw-haw!

447
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:23,868
(laughs)
Sorry.

448
00:20:26,938 --> 00:20:29,006
Oh! (grunts)

449
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:30,341
Whoa! Oh!

450
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,179
"Mark Zuckerberg is..."
