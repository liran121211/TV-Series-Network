whooping cough, hectic fever,
cancrum otis,

Stop this!
Stop this at once, or I'll...

158
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:22,855
Or what? You're just gonna
die soon anyway!

159

160
00:07:24,524 --> 00:07:25,924
I'm warning you!

161
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:28,761
You are making a
very powerful temporary enemy!

162
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:30,796
Sir, you'd better not
rile them up.

163

I'm well and truly hated.

However, you will
change your tune

167

when you see the legacy
I'm leaving behind me.

168
00:07:44,044 --> 00:07:46,145

to an orchard

169

treat others the way

327
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:29,932
Okay, here's your choice:

328
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:32,534
cash in my hands
or blood on the jerky.

329
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:35,721
I believe you want
the assistant manager, sir.

330
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:38,590
Oh, I can't shoot him.
I've got him next.

331
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:41,293
Well, that is your bad luck,
because he is mine right now.

332
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,829
Come back in half an hour.
He can be your accomplice.

333
00:15:43,896 --> 00:15:45,697
I was going to
take him ice skating.

334
00:15:45,765 --> 00:15:46,632
What was that?

335
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:47,532
Nothing.

336
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,334
What was that?
Ice skating?

337
00:15:49,402 --> 00:15:51,937
Do you do axels
and Salchows?

338
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:53,739
What do you do?
(scoffs)

339
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:59,211
Check out my new dad!
Sorry, lame-o!

340
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,881
It's 2:00, which makes him my
Uncle Ed for an hour.

341
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:05,951
No, it's Saturday, which makes
him that guy at the Youth Center

342
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:07,653
who really believes in me.

343
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,389
There's still time for me to
turn my life around, right?

344
00:16:11,824 --> 00:16:14,326
It's not that easy, man!

345
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:16,261
(sobs)

00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:19,264
(doorbell rings)

347
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:20,165
All yours.

348
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:21,600
What did you do with him?

349
00:16:21,668 --> 00:16:23,869
Found a way
to use him as a bong.

(coughs)

351
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:28,807
(woozy moan)

352
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,108
(sighs)

353
00:16:30,176 --> 00:16:32,878
Dad, Mr. Burns is here
for you again.

354
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:34,579
(moans)
Already?

355
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:36,915
A little tired of revenge,
are we?

356
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:41,053
Yeah, I've done all I can do
in that medium.

357
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,922
All right. Mr. Burns,
I'm going to show you

358
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,059
that not all of us in this town
are vindictive and cruel.

359
00:16:47,126 --> 00:16:49,394
(pumps barrel)
Not today.

360
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:56,852
I thought,
after all you went through,

361
00:16:56,936 --> 00:16:58,770
you just might want to
spend an hour

362
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:00,689
in a place where
you felt at home.

363
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:02,874
Lots of room for friends.

364
00:17:02,942 --> 00:17:06,611
Actually, sir, the man who lived
here didn't have many friends.

365
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:09,381
But you're a better person
than he ever was.

366
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:11,816
(hums)

367
00:17:11,868 --> 00:17:12,884
(gasps)

368
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,654
That's me!

369
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:17,522
Yes, technically it's you.

370
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,257
But like I said,
people change.

371
00:17:19,325 --> 00:17:22,127
And they can also
bloody well change back!

372
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:23,328
(whimpers)

373
00:17:25,865 --> 00:17:28,667
Daddy's home.

374
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:30,886
(motor humming)

375
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,814
I don't have time for the
papers, Smithers.

376
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:41,317
Any terrorist attacks on
American soil today?

377
00:17:41,384 --> 00:17:44,119
I'm sorry, but no.
Oh...

378
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:45,588
BURNS:
Smithers!

379
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:48,657
Trading me in
for a younger model, I see.

380
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:50,459
Mr. Burns!
You're alive!

381
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,095
I'm so happy
I could... hug you!

382
00:17:53,163 --> 00:17:55,497
(scoffs) And me smell like
drugstore cologne

383
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:57,766
the rest of the day?
I don't think so.

384
00:17:57,834 --> 00:18:01,036
You may hug... my shadow.
(cry of delight)

385
00:18:01,104 --> 00:18:03,238
(ecstatic cries)
(clearing throat)

386
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:05,040
Oh, Mr. Vice President...

387
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:08,711
I've loved this time we've spent
in this dormant volcano, but...

388
00:18:08,778 --> 00:18:09,945
You're leaving me,
aren't you?

389
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:11,747
I... I am.

390
00:18:11,815 --> 00:18:14,450
You realize that every time
I don't get what I want,

391
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:15,884
Al Qaeda wins?

392
00:18:15,952 --> 00:18:17,720
Can I go now?
Yes.

393
00:18:17,787 --> 00:18:19,989
I just need
to erase your memory.

394
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:21,557
(zapping)

395
00:18:23,026 --> 00:18:24,360
(grumbles)

396
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:27,162
(helicopter whirring)

397
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,198
BURNS (over bullhorn):
Attention, insects!

398
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:31,400
The foot of reckoning
has arrived!

399
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:35,170
Hey there, Mr. Burns!

400
00:18:35,238 --> 00:18:37,539
For our half hour, I thought
we'd have a picnic in the park.

401
00:18:37,607 --> 00:18:39,608
Silence, you sadistic monster!

402
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:41,243
I've got my memory back,

403
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:43,779
and I'm going to wreak a
terrible vengeance.

404
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:45,948
Taking an idea I got
from a Stephen King book,

405
00:18:46,016 --> 00:18:49,318
I'm going to cover this town
with a dome!

406
00:18:49,386 --> 00:18:52,621
(evil laughter)

407
00:18:52,689 --> 00:18:54,623
It's been done!

408
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:55,991
Really?

409
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:57,793
You don't say.

410
00:18:57,861 --> 00:18:59,094
Did you know about this?

411
00:18:59,162 --> 00:19:00,295
Mm-hmm.

412
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:01,563
I see.

413
00:19:05,402 --> 00:19:09,071
Well, what if I cover
you all with...

414
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:11,607
a cube of bulletproof
plexiglas?!

415
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:13,976
Uh, it's pretty much
the same thing.

416
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:15,944
Plus we could always
dig ourselves out,

417
00:19:16,012 --> 00:19:18,280
although that never seems
to occur to anybody.

418
00:19:18,348 --> 00:19:20,783
Set 'er down, Smithers.

419
00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:27,222
Mr. Burns, you can't hurt us
after all we've done for you.

420
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,191
What the devil
are you talking about?

421
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:31,293
You were given
six weeks to live,

422
00:19:31,361 --> 00:19:33,062
and you've outlived it!

423
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:35,431
I think what kept you alive

424
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:39,635
was that for once in your life
you were helping other people.

425
00:19:41,304 --> 00:19:42,604
Could it be?

426
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:45,340
Perhaps kindness did
keep me alive.

427
00:19:45,408 --> 00:19:48,077
Young man, would you like
a lemon drop?

428
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:49,411
Mmm!

429
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,579
(groaning)

430
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:56,585
(cries)

431
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,554
(pop)

432
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:02,324
It wasn't kindness that was
keeping me alive,

433
00:20:02,392 --> 00:20:05,127
it was bile
building up inside!

434
00:20:05,195 --> 00:20:08,864
Loathing is my life blood,
and rage my royal jelly!

435
00:20:08,932 --> 00:20:12,101
So yes, thank you,
Springfield, for giving me

436
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:14,503
the secret to eternal life--
hate!

437
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:16,939
You're welcome!

438
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,844
What are you doing here?

439
00:20:21,911 --> 00:20:23,979
You were my father
for two hours,

440
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:26,949
and I'm not letting
this dad get away!

441
00:20:27,016 --> 00:20:28,517
Oh! Preposterous!

442
00:20:28,585 --> 00:20:30,486
I won't be Bismarcked
into fathering anyone!

443
00:20:30,553 --> 00:20:31,987
Listen, old man.

444
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:34,256
I need someone to
cheer me on in the school play.

445
00:20:34,324 --> 00:20:35,824
And it's gonna be you,

446
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:39,428
or this copter's goin' down!

447
00:20:39,496 --> 00:20:40,846
You know I'll do it!

448
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,402
Thank God your son can't see
the way you're behaving.

449
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,072
My son?
My son?!

450
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,675
The truth is...
I don't have a son!

451
00:20:53,743 --> 00:20:57,112
Haw-haw!
Haw-haw!

452
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,782
Haw-haw!

453
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:02,618
That's my boy!
