(groaning)

16
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:48,842
I don't even want to smell
sparkling apple juice again.

17
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,744
Aw. Poor baby.

18
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:55,316
Come on, Bart.

19
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:56,884
Afraid of a little
apple juice?

20
00:01:56,952 --> 00:01:58,452
(laughing)

21
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,187
Pig in a blanket!
Dad's underwear.

22
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:01,789
Aunt Selma's leg.

23
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,524
I hate New Year's Eve.

24
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:05,659
I can't believe I made out

25
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:08,395
with Ryan Seacrest
on the TV screen.

26
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:09,630
(raspy groan)

27
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:11,265
Let's just
take it easy.

28
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,268
We all made mistakes
on New Year's Eve.

29
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,841
There's only one
upside to today.

30
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:23,043
(snoring)

31
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:25,195
Come on,
just one more drink, Marge.

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,364
BOTH:
Happy New Year!

33
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:29,116
Aah!
(noisemakers blaring)

34
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:31,785
MARGE:
Everyone shush!

35
00:02:31,853 --> 00:02:33,354
Why are you hungover?

36
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:34,588
I didn't see you drink
last night.

37
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:36,357
I didn't.

38
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:38,959
I got secondhand wasted
from smooching your father.

39
00:02:39,027 --> 00:02:42,429
So not a peep out of anyone
till the Fiesta Bowl.

40
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:44,331
That's not
for five hours.

41
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:46,367
I know when the freaking
Fiesta Bowl is!

42
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:47,868
Sweetie, relax.

43
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,170
Let's just watch some TV.

44
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:51,572
(drums pounding)

45
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,507
New Year's Eve might be over

46
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:56,377
in America, but we're still
rocking hard in Samoa.

47
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:58,646
And here come the Blue Angels

48
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:01,248
waking up the shrieking
wah-wah birds.

49
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:02,583
(jet engines roaring)

50
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:05,319
(raucous squawking)

51
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,128
(siren whoops)

52
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,262
Well, well, well.

53
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,764
Simpson, you've committed

54
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:18,866
Springfield's first
crime of the new year.

55
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,301
Write him up, Lou.

56
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:21,802
Huh? What'd I do?

57
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,337
Failed to separate

58
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:25,706
your bottles
and newspapers.

59
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:27,274
50 bucks?!

60
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:29,276
That used to cover
two public nudities

61
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:31,912
and a poop in the park.
(grumbles)

62
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:34,381
Aah! That's vandalizing
city property.

63
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,784
Write him up
again, Lou.

64
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:39,353
What the hell?!
Mild obscenity before 10:00 a.m.

65
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:40,954
Also illegal.

66
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:42,690
Come on, Lou.
Give me a break.

67
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:45,159
Sorry, sir.
I take no pleasure in it.

68
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,927
♪ Da-da-da, dee,
da-da-da, da-hah ♪

69
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:48,195
Oh, yeah.

70
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:52,099
Since when is all this
against the law?

71
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,500
Since today.

72
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:56,337
As of Jan one,
a bunch of new ordinances--

73
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:59,673
with, uh, outrageous financial
penalties-- took effect.

74
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:01,275
Oh, I get it.

75
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:02,776
The government runs out
of money,

76
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:04,411
so they pass a bunch
of lame-o laws

77
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,313
to sock it to the little guy.

78
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:07,748
Fine. You're telling
it like it is.

79
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:09,350
Also a crime now.

80
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:10,417
And that one's
going to cost you.

81
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:12,953
(Homer wails)

82
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:15,155
That's almost $1,000!

83
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:17,558
Rounding up your total--
that's a $50 fine.

84
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,759
(whimpers)

85
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:22,396
Wow, Homer.
This year's only 11 hours old,

86
00:04:22,464 --> 00:04:24,765
and it's already
your annus horribilis.

87
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,167
My New Year's resolution
was to learn Latin.

88
00:04:27,235 --> 00:04:30,537
Uh, listen, Homer--
I know a guy who fixes things

89
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,373
for folks who need
things fixed.

90
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,875
But, uh, I can't talk
about it here.

91
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:39,346
Eh, still not private enough.

92
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:42,149
Uh, this is private,
but a little dank.

93
00:04:43,752 --> 00:04:46,253
Uh, whoopsie.

94
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:49,089
Glinda, Madame Morrible,
flying monkeys there,

95
00:04:49,157 --> 00:04:52,393
can you tell me how I can
get back to my bar?

96
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,463
Moe, you've always had the
power to get back to the bar.

97
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,868
Whoa! It's a chimpan-me.

98
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:19,953
Maybe we should let these
people enjoy their show.

99
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:25,259
Homer, what you do

100
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:28,295
is go down to window
nine at the courthouse.

101
00:05:28,363 --> 00:05:30,297
You slip the
guy 100 bucks,

102
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:32,466
and your record
is as clean as...

103
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:35,769
Uh, I ain't got nothing,
uh, clean to compare it to.

104
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:40,541
(groans) Ten minutes?

105
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:42,242
I can't wait that long.

106
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,111
I left an ice cream cone
in my cup holder.

107
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,815
(grunts)
Hold on. I will get help.

108
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:50,884
Must break glass.

109
00:05:50,952 --> 00:05:52,820
(grunting)

110
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,725
No!

111
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,095
(chuckling)

112
00:06:02,163 --> 00:06:03,530
(guns cocking)

113
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:05,732
Homer Simpson, you
are under arrest

114
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,202
for attempted bribery
of a public official.

115
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:11,605
Chief, this is just
a big misunderstanding.

116
00:06:11,673 --> 00:06:14,174
I meant to write "bride."

117
00:06:14,242 --> 00:06:16,210
It's a wedding
present.

118
00:06:16,277 --> 00:06:17,744
Oh, how thoughtful.

119
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:19,313
Aah! My bribe!

120
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,714
Cuff him, Lou.

121
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:26,053
Oh, this is supposed to be
the happiest day of my life,

122
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,155
and it's ruined.

123
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:30,624
Homer Simpson, you
are hereby sentenced

124
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:33,627
to ten years
in the federal penitentiary.

125
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:35,195
It's okay. It's okay.

126
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,598
I can be out in 18 months
with good behavior.

127
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:38,932
We're Simpsons, Dad.

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,701
We don't do
good behavior.

129
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:43,237
Don't tell me I'm not capable
of good behavior!

130
00:06:43,304 --> 00:06:45,939
(gagging)
(angry shouting)

131
00:06:47,976 --> 00:06:50,777
Your Honor, I would like
to request a sidebar.

132
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:52,179
Granted.

133
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:53,580
(grunting)

134
00:06:53,648 --> 00:06:55,482
(screaming)

135
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:00,098
CHIEF WIGGUM:
Ten years.

136
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,134
(clicking tongue)

137
00:07:01,177 --> 00:07:03,645
That is a long time to be
away from your family.

138
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:08,302
All that time I'll be stuck
in my cell, unable to exercise.

139
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,838
Actually, most convicts
work out like crazy.

140
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:13,908
I repeat: unable to exercise.

141
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,877
Look, Simpson,
there is one thing

142
00:07:15,944 --> 00:07:17,812
you can do
to get out sooner,

143
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,148
but, uh, it is
extremely dangerous.

144
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,784
Simpson, we are
currently conducting

145
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:24,752
a 20-year investigation

146
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,989
into the activities of
Anthony "Fat Tony" D'Amico.

147
00:07:28,057 --> 00:07:29,824
What, this guy?

148
00:07:32,428 --> 00:07:33,327
Oops.

149
00:07:35,064 --> 00:07:35,997
(wry laugh)

150
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:37,598
We're going to plant you

151
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,834
in Fat Tony's gang
as an undercover informant.

152
00:07:39,902 --> 00:07:41,536
I can't go undercover
with Fat Tony.

153
00:07:41,603 --> 00:07:42,837
He's met me.

154
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:44,305
I've been in his house.

155
00:07:44,373 --> 00:07:47,008
I was briefly
his "conserigliary..."

156
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:51,245
consugly... canoliar...
Robert Duvall.

157
00:07:51,313 --> 00:07:53,748
Everyone knows Fat Tony,
so we're going to plant you

158
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:56,184
in the prison with a
disguise and a new name.

159
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:57,719
Can I be Johnny Undercover?

160
00:07:57,786 --> 00:07:58,920
That's a little obvious.

161
00:07:58,987 --> 00:08:00,722
Okay. Melvin Mafia.

162
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:02,423
No. You will be known

163
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:04,792
as Nicky "Blue Pants"
Altosaxophony.

164
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,527
Can I keep the name
after I'm done?

165
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:08,496
No. It belongs to the government.
Oh.

166
00:08:08,564 --> 00:08:10,598
MAN (over P.A.):
No ice cream available!

167
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:11,916
Children, stay away!

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,201
(disappointed groans)

169
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:14,736
(coos with admiration)

170
00:08:14,803 --> 00:08:16,504
Now, pay attention.

171
00:08:16,572 --> 00:08:18,122
We're going to move
in on Fat Tony

172
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,341
when he takes delivery on a
shipment of Belgian guns.

173
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:22,376
In your left sideburn
is a fiber-optic camera.

174
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:24,345
In your right,
a wireless mic.

175
00:08:24,413 --> 00:08:26,180
To zoom in, you go, "Ayyy!"

176
00:08:26,248 --> 00:08:28,783
To zoom out, go, "Ohhh!"

177
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:32,820
Ayyy. Ohhh! Ayyy. Ohhh!

178
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,922
Fuhgetaboutit!

179
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,457
That activates
the auto-destruct.

180
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:38,626
(howling, hooting)

181
00:08:38,694 --> 00:08:41,763
Dear Lord, watch over
my sweet Homie

182
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,831
while he's in
the hoosegow.

183
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,666
Keep him safe
from shanks and shivs.

184
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,635
Let him become rich
in the jail yard currencies

185
00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:49,670
of cigarettes and dried fish.

186
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,412
Uh, what's my
name again?

187
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,714
Okay, I'm coming.

188
00:08:59,782 --> 00:09:01,215
(inmate shrieks)

189
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:02,850
I'd like a third
helping, please.

190
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:06,120
You do know the meat is made
from diseased pigeons.

191
00:09:06,188 --> 00:09:08,422
Just get the ladle
down there deep.

192
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,258
That's where
the beaks are.

193
00:09:13,195 --> 00:09:15,630
Hey, you're that guy
from the FB-- mmph!

194
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:16,964
Time to go to work.

195
00:09:17,032 --> 00:09:18,900
Stop licking my hand.

196
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:20,935
There was
barbecue sauce on it.

197
00:09:21,003 --> 00:09:22,937
Here's how it goes down:
I rough up Louie.

198
00:09:23,005 --> 00:09:25,206
Then you stand up to me,
earning his trust.

199
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,643
But I haven't earned his trust
if it's based on a lie.

200
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,344
Enough of your
dime-store morality.

201
00:09:30,412 --> 00:09:31,813
What's a dime store?

202
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,648
I... (groans)

203
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:37,919
Aah!
(guards laughing)

204
00:09:37,986 --> 00:09:39,754
Blue pants power!

205
00:09:39,821 --> 00:09:41,122
Ow! Hey.

206
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,925
Hey, Nicky Blue,
you're one tough yegg.

207
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:46,360
If you come out of your
beating in one piece,

208
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:48,229
you and I should
have a face-to-face.

209
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,664
Beating? What beating?

210
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:51,032
(gasps)

211
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:52,700
Oh, that beating.

212
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:57,772
Don't worry. We're not
going to touch you.

213
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,340
We'll make it sound
like a beating

214
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:01,108
by tenderizing
these steaks.

215
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:02,710
Can I have any of the steaks?

216
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:03,945
No.

217
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:06,347
(screaming)

218
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:11,219
HOMER:
That's so mean!

219
00:10:11,286 --> 00:10:14,722
Whoa! I'm impressed over here
with that guy over there.

220
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,607
Please! Let me have it!

221
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:17,959
(agonized yelling)

222
00:10:18,026 --> 00:10:19,126
Come on!

223
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:20,995
Give it to me
right in the mouth!

224
00:10:21,063 --> 00:10:23,664
(Homer wails)

225
00:10:27,703 --> 00:10:28,970
(sighs)

226
00:10:29,037 --> 00:10:31,973
Well, back in my keister you go.

227
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,443
We brought someone
to spring you.

228
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,779
Now, let us escort
you to freedom.

229
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:39,981
How are you going to do that?

230
00:10:40,048 --> 00:10:41,816
Let's just say this prison

231
00:10:41,884 --> 00:10:44,952
was built
by Mob construction workers.

232
00:10:53,595 --> 00:10:54,929
He's in.

233
00:10:54,997 --> 00:10:56,764
Aw, for-- I was
going to say that!

234
00:10:58,233 --> 00:10:59,734
What's going on?

235
00:10:59,801 --> 00:11:02,670
I called the prison and they
won't tell me where Homer is.

236
00:11:02,738 --> 00:11:04,472
Sorry, Marge, I can't tell you.
(sighs)

237
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,675
If it makes you feel better, I
can tell you about someone else.

238
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:11,012
Ooh! How about Krusty
in the drunk tank? Aha.

239
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:14,148
(slurring):
If, if Jews control the media,

240
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:18,352
why can't I get on
Jimmy Kimmel, huh? Huh?

241
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,720
(frustrated groan)

242
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:26,961
So. What do you think
of the sauce?

243
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:31,132
I detect a distinct
lack of oregano.

244
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,734
I'll take care of this.

245
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,505
You carry oregano with you?

246
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,908
Oregano, basil,
rosemary...

247
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:43,010
I-I think I got a ketchup
packet for you, boss.

248
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,746
Did you order French fries
and not use it?

249
00:11:45,814 --> 00:11:48,416
Well, they gave me two packets,
but I only needed one.

250
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:52,119
What other secrets
are you hiding from me?

251
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:55,222
I-I-I bring my own candy
to the movie theater.

252
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,325
Louie...

253
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,201
My beloved Anna Maria.

254
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:11,305
I hope Heaven's powder room
is painted that eggshell blue

255
00:12:11,373 --> 00:12:13,841
(cell phone buzzing)
you could never
achieve on Earth.

256
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:18,779
(sniffs)

257
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:20,414
(snuffling):
Sorry, boss.

258
00:12:20,482 --> 00:12:22,483
No apology necessary.

259
00:12:22,551 --> 00:12:24,368
I am touched.

260
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:27,054
You and me, Nicky.
We feel.

261
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:31,192
Legs, Louie, Jimmy the Axe,
Tommy the Face-Shooter--

262
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:33,494
they never share my grief.

263
00:12:33,562 --> 00:12:37,598
(scoffs) Yeah. Those guys are
probably FBI informants.

264
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,301
You think an informant
could get that close to me?

265
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:41,602
Oh, yeah.

266
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,405
I got in your gang, and you
barely know who I am.

267
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:46,640
That is good
counsel indeed.

268
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,643
You have earned my complete,
unquestioning trust.

269
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:52,013
But first,
one little thing.

270
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,016
You must make your bones.

271
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,152
Wh-What are
we doing here?

272
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,488
I will tell you.

273
00:13:00,555 --> 00:13:04,558
<i>When I call for my Russian</i>
<i>business partner, Yuri Nator,</i>

274
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:06,527
<i>I don't expect</i>
<i>to be screamed at</i>

275
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:09,830
<i>like I was some ten-year-old</i>
<i>punk making a prank call.</i>

276
00:13:09,898 --> 00:13:12,466
Yuri Nator?
Yuri Nator!

277
00:13:12,534 --> 00:13:15,302
Hey, my mouth is begging
for a Yuri Nator!

278
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,038
(laughing)

279
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:18,906
Be careful what
you wish for.

280
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:21,542
Why, you... I'm going to
chop you into little pieces,

281
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,044
and make you
into a Rubik's cube,

282
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:24,912
which I will never solve!

283
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:29,316
Well, I guess
I could tell him

284
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:31,218
he could improve
his phone etiquette.

285
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:34,622
Tell him with fire.

286
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,257
(anxiously):
Ooh-hoo.

287
00:13:36,324 --> 00:13:38,192
What's the matter, Nicky?

288
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,428
You got a problem
with this job?

289
00:13:40,495 --> 00:13:42,763
Oh, no, no!
I was, uh, just thinking

290
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:45,032
how cheap this crime
would've been in the 70's,

291
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,284
when gas was 35 cents a gallon.

292
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,035
It was either this,
or put in a ladies' room.

293
00:14:02,103 --> 00:14:03,870
(sirens approaching)

294
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,212
Exquisite.

295
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,981
As a reward, I've planned
a little surprise for you.

296
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,716
(yells)

297
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,620
This is horrible!
I keep smelling my own breath!

298
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,188
Nicolas Blue Pants,

299
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,391
you have shown
great fazagabool

300
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:23,094
in the face of overwhelming
spoogatzagatini.

301
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,597
Huh?

302
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,935
You're a made man, my friend.
Welcome!

303
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,337
Ooh...

304
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,241
Nicky, welcome to
the family.

305
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,778
From now on, you don't know
where you end and we begin.

306
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,080
Your problems
are our problems.

307
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,915
My neck is kind of itchy.

308
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,134
Then all of our necks are itchy.

309
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,353
Now that you mention it, itchy like crazy!
I gotta shave my back.

310
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,854
Aw.

311
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,325
Nicky, my friend,

312
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,028
tonight is a big score I've
been setting up for months.

313
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,233
<i>Just you and me.</i>

314
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,235
Sharing it together.

315
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,871
To heterosexual
male friendship,

316
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,574
the kind the Greeks
wrote about.

317
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:10,575
(foghorn blares)

318
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:11,776
Huh?

319
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,581
Here they are!
My Belgian guns.

320
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,851
Belgian guns. I've been waiting
half my life for this moment.

321
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,319
SUPERVISOR (over radio):
All units, move in!

322
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,987
Tony, you got to get
out of here, now!

323
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,022
What? Why?

324
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,091
Don't ask questions, just go!

325
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:28,593
What's gotten into you?
You're as nervous as a cat

326
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,162
when Johnny Kick-A-Cat
walks into the room.

327
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,131
<i>Verlaat de vuurwapens</i>

328
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,533
<i>op het dok En wij kunnen</i>
<i>een Chimay bier drinken!</i>

329
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,103
Get a shot of
Tony with the guns.

330
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,404
(nervously):
Um, eh...

331
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:40,772
FBI SUPERVISOR (over radio):
Closer.

332
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,674
Ayyy...
FBI SUPERVISOR: Too close.

333
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:43,942
Ohhh!
Closer.

334
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,443
Ayyy.

335
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,213
Too close.
HOMER: Ohhh!

336
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,847
Perfect.

337
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,049
Wait a minute.

338
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,220
(sirens wailing)

339
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,955
How could you, Nicky?

340
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,090
I would have
given you everything.

341
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,758
In the strip club
of my heart,

342
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,827
you held the key to
the champagne room.

343
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,963
I loved you, man.

344
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,197
(gasps)

345
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,970
He's dead.

346
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:15,106
No. You're wrong! Check again!

347
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,341
Fuhgetaboutit.

348
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,335
Homer, I just want to say

349
00:16:36,404 --> 00:16:39,058
that of all the rat bastards
we've had working for us,

350
00:16:39,158 --> 00:16:40,296
you were the snitchiest.

351
00:16:40,396 --> 00:16:42,397
So that's it. You
used me to kill a man,

352
00:16:42,465 --> 00:16:44,766
and all I get is a
handshake and a blanket?

353
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:47,235
We didn't say you
could use the blanket.

354
00:16:47,303 --> 00:16:49,871
And I'm not gonna
shake your hand.

355
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:52,574
Poor Tony.
He didn't deserve this.

356
00:16:52,642 --> 00:16:56,111
He was just a soldier
in a war he started.

357
00:16:57,613 --> 00:17:00,148
(cooing happily)

358
00:17:00,216 --> 00:17:03,652
Homie, I know you had
a terrible experience,

359
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:05,086
but it's over.

360
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:08,156
It's not over, Marge.
It'll never be over.

361
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:11,426
When I shut my eyes, all I see
is Fat Tony and me

362
00:17:11,494 --> 00:17:13,662
having drinks
at that bar on the beach.

363
00:17:13,729 --> 00:17:15,897
You never took me to
that bar on the beach.

364
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:18,300
Oh. Well, uh...

365
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:20,769
you wouldn't like it;
it's not very good.

366
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:22,237
Sounds pretty good.

367
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:24,573
No, no, I oversold it.

368
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:30,679
(thunder rumbles)

369
00:17:33,482 --> 00:17:35,784
I'd give anything
to bring you back.

370
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,454
MALE VOICE:
Wake up, Homer.

371
00:17:39,522 --> 00:17:41,623
HOMER:
Huh? Wha...? (gasps)

372
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:43,458
Fat Tony.

373
00:17:43,526 --> 00:17:46,361
No. I'm his cousin
from San Diego--

374
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:49,497
Fit Tony.

375
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:53,835
Wow, I've never seen a mobster
use a track suit for exercising.

376
00:17:53,903 --> 00:17:57,839
And there's no better exercise
than killing and disemboweling

377
00:17:57,907 --> 00:18:00,308
a big, fat snitch.

378
00:18:00,376 --> 00:18:01,643
I understand.

379
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:03,511
I loved him too.

380
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:04,846
(sobbing)

381
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,319
Your tears seem
in no way crocodilian.

382
00:18:11,387 --> 00:18:12,954
Do what you got to do.

383
00:18:13,022 --> 00:18:14,789
The quicker you
kill me up here,

384
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:16,725
the quicker he can
kill me down there.

385
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:21,363
Join me on the
elliptical machines.

386
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,732
I will let you live for...

387
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,468
20 minutes.

388
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:33,508
I worked for Fat Tony.

389
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:35,443
And he was the best
boss I ever had.

390
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:37,445
Well. This is awkward.

391
00:18:37,513 --> 00:18:39,881
What? Oh, uh, Mr. Burns!

392
00:18:39,949 --> 00:18:42,083
Uh, you were cool, too.

393
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:46,788
Oh, I so believe that.

394
00:18:46,856 --> 00:18:50,525
He took me to a fight that
he fixed, but he never let on,

395
00:18:50,593 --> 00:18:53,211
not even when I bet $500
on the wrong guy.

396
00:18:53,295 --> 00:18:55,196
(chuckling)

397
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:57,599
Then he said he would
dope a horse for me.

398
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:00,935
Homer, it is time...

399
00:19:01,003 --> 00:19:04,506
to switch your elliptical
machine to cool-down mode.

400
00:19:04,573 --> 00:19:07,676
Are you going to kill me now?
'Cause I'm super ready.

401
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:11,246
No. Because my cousin
lives on in your memories.

402
00:19:11,313 --> 00:19:12,847
And to extinguish you

403
00:19:12,915 --> 00:19:15,583
would be to whack
what still remains of him.

404
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:19,320
Wow. The killers
have been kind to me.

405
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:21,389
While the people who are
supposed to protect me

406
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:22,791
treated me like dirt!

407
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:24,559
What kind of
a world is this?

408
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:25,944
It's pretty screwed-up.

409
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:28,246
That's why I keep
my friends close.

410
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,698
And your enemies closer?

411
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:31,299
No, why would I do that?

412
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:33,668
If they were close,
they would kill me.

413

415
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:44,713
<i>The pressures got to him,</i>

416
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,316

417
