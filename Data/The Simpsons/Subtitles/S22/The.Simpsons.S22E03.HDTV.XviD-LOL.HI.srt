00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:17,741
with the following
<i>colossal</i> exception.

179
00:08:17,808 --> 00:08:20,160
Before the fourth inning
after a road loss

180
00:08:20,227 --> 00:08:22,112
in a domed stadium.

181
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:24,080
Th it's good to be Greinke.

182
00:08:24,148 --> 00:08:25,865
Uh, unless he's got a bunion,

183
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:28,601
in which case he is notably
ineffective. (chuckles)

184
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:32,872
Wow. I'm surprised you guys know
so much about a sport.

185
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,942
Oh, Lisa, baseball is a game
played by the dexterous,

186
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,045
but only understood
by the Poin-dexterous.

187
00:08:39,113 --> 00:08:41,865
(chuckling) If you understand
what I've laid out there.

188
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:44,517
The key to understanding
the game is sabermetrics.

189
00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:45,852
Huh?!

190
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,589
The field was developed
by statistician Bill James.

191
00:08:49,657 --> 00:08:53,460
I made baseball as much fun
as doing your taxes!

192
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:55,161
Using sabermetrics,

193
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:57,363
even an eight-year-old girl
can run a ball club

194
00:08:57,431 --> 00:08:59,399
with the sagacity
of a Stengel,

195
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:02,051
and the single-mindedness
of a Steinbrenner.

196
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:04,888
I call it a Stein-stengel...
(mutters)

197
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:06,940
(chuckles)
Thanks, guys.

198
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:09,692
Hey, speaking of stats,

199
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,227
I'm none too pleased

200
00:09:11,295 --> 00:09:12,762
about your ratio
of seats occupied

201
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,631
to beers ordered.

202
00:09:14,698 --> 00:09:16,065
You mean
our SOBO?

203
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:17,634
Let's
calculate it now!

204
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:20,770
(muttering)

205
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:23,873
What's the conversion
factor for ginger beer?

206
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:26,543
Refreshingness
over effervescence.

207
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,244
Plus or minus tang.

208
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:30,313
Oh, why did I advertise
my drink specials

209
00:09:30,381 --> 00:09:32,315
in <i>Scientific American?</i>

210
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:33,983
I can think of
three reasons.

211
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:35,552
First of all,
you...
Shut up.

212
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:38,188
ANNOUNCER:
So we're one-one in the third,

213
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:40,256
and Isotots manager Lisa Simpson

214
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:43,726
rearranges her defense
one more time.

215
00:09:43,794 --> 00:09:45,962
I haven't seen this many books
in a dugout

216
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,198
since Albert Einstein
went canoeing.

217
00:09:50,084 --> 00:09:52,785
Everyone shift
towards right!

218
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:55,054
ALL:
Huh?

219
00:09:56,974 --> 00:09:58,124
(cheering)

220
00:09:58,192 --> 00:10:01,211
I caught a white apple!

221
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:04,130
("Take Me Out
to the Ballgame" plays)

222
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,483
(whimpers)

223
00:10:33,043 --> 00:10:35,345
Okay. Everyone
study two-out situations,

224
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:36,813
count management,

225
00:10:36,881 --> 00:10:39,249
and I'll be back
with some gluten-free crackers.

226
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:42,635
(gasps)
Your spreadsheets!

227
00:10:42,703 --> 00:10:45,405
Oh, my stupid sister's taken
the fun out of baseball.

228
00:10:45,472 --> 00:10:47,173
What happened to stealing bases,

229
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:50,276
the suicide squeeze,
throwing a little chin music?

230
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:52,212
We're no longer
cellar dwellers.

231
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,714
Well, the team isn't.

232
00:10:54,782 --> 00:10:56,683
This isn't the game
I grew up with,

233
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,552
the game played in the misty
ballparks of Enron Field,

234
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:02,722
or Pac Bell,
then SBC, now AT & T Park.

235
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,742
And from now on,
I'm gonna play my game.

236
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:07,844
Dummyball.

237
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:10,046
ANNOUNCER:
Bart Simpson on deck,

238
00:11:10,114 --> 00:11:12,582
his bat's just hungering
for a homer,

239
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,051
like Chronos for his children.

240
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,552
Speaking of Homer,

241
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,655
Bart's father's name is,
you guessed it,

242
00:11:18,722 --> 00:11:20,456
not on my fact sheet.

243
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:24,193
Bart, this guy's walked
the last two batters,

244
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:26,229
and if he walks you,
we win the game.

245
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:27,597
Don't swing at anything!

246
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:28,865
But I'm on a hot streak.

247
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:32,785
Hot streaks are
a statistical illusion.

248
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:35,038
I wish you were a
statistical illusion.

249
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:37,557
Well, there's a 97 %
chance I'm not,

250
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,592
so do what I say.

251
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,877
(grumbling)

252
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:46,649
Ball one!

253
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:50,203
Ball two!

254
00:11:50,271 --> 00:11:52,071
Don't swing.

255
00:11:53,757 --> 00:11:55,792
I've ruined your favorite thing!

256
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:57,643
Oh...
(grunts)

257
00:11:57,695 --> 00:11:59,495
(crowd cheering)

258
00:12:14,945 --> 00:12:16,829
TEAM:
Bart! Bart! Bart!

259
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,965
You disobeyed
your manager!

260
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:20,600
So what?
We won.

261
00:12:20,668 --> 00:12:22,769
TEAM:
Bart! Bart! Bart!

262
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:25,238
Here's what: you're
off the team!

263
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:27,640
Get him out
of here, boys.

264
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:31,044
TEAM:
Conflicted,
conflicted, conflicted.

265
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:34,585
(Agnes mutters)

266
00:12:42,898 --> 00:12:44,399
Come on, guys.

267
00:12:44,442 --> 00:12:45,909
I had to get rid of Bart.

268
00:12:45,977 --> 00:12:48,144
But he socked a
walk-off dinger.

269
00:12:48,212 --> 00:12:50,046
That dinger was a fluke.

270
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:51,982
Not that I have
to defend myself to you.

271
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:54,417
Managers manage,
and players play.

272
00:12:54,485 --> 00:12:56,069
Do alligators
alligate?

273
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:57,304
I don't know... yes!

274
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:58,338
I'm scared.

275
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,176
Here's my uniform,

276
00:13:03,244 --> 00:13:04,427
(grunts)

277
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:05,946
since I won't be
needing it anymore.

278
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:07,097
Whoo-hoo!

279
00:13:07,164 --> 00:13:08,548
Underpants dinner!
(grunts)

280
00:13:08,616 --> 00:13:09,900
No, it's not.

281
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:10,967
Aww.

282
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:12,435
You know, Lis,

283
00:13:12,503 --> 00:13:14,170
I'm glad I'm not
playing baseball anymore.

284
00:13:14,238 --> 00:13:16,573
I think I'm more
interested in soccer.

285
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:17,474
(thudding loudly)
Ow!

286
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:21,828
(loud thudding, grunting)

287
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:23,129
Hey. Cut it out!

288
00:13:23,197 --> 00:13:24,714
You're upsetting
the gravy boat.

289
00:13:24,782 --> 00:13:26,933
I'll put a stop
to this nonsense.

290
00:13:29,503 --> 00:13:32,472
Lisa, can't you let your
brother back on the team?

291
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,294
Fly balls and fungoes come and
go, but family is forever.

292
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:39,529
Sorry Marge, I got
to call bullcrap on that.

293
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:42,832
The '69 Mets will live on
forever, but do you think

294
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,335
anyone cares about Ron Swoboda's
wife and kids?

295
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:48,355
Not me, and, I assume,
not Ron Swoboda!

296
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:50,457
What about
Bart's feelings?

297
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:52,559
Boys don't have feelings.
They have muscles.

298
00:13:52,627 --> 00:13:55,262
Why do you say
such ridiculous things?

299
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:57,330
They sound good in my brain,

300
00:13:57,398 --> 00:14:02,135
then my tongue makes not the
words sound very good, formally.

301
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:05,772
(grunting)

302
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,208
(snoring)

303
00:14:08,276 --> 00:14:10,610
(grunting)

304
00:14:12,313 --> 00:14:14,064
"Mama Bear said,

305
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:16,933
'I'm sure Sister Bear
will come to her senses.'"

306
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:20,904
"Then Pete Rose plowed into
his friend Ray Fosse..."

307
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:24,641
(Marge continues)
"...dislocating Fosse's shoulder
in a meaningless game."

308
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:27,978
(shouting): "He had earned the
nickname 'Charlie Hustle'..."

309
00:14:28,045 --> 00:14:29,479
(Homer shouting)
"Mama Bear said,

310
00:14:29,547 --> 00:14:32,248
'Families should stick together
because...'"

311
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:33,817
"...personal feelings get
between him and home plate!"

312
00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:35,018
"'...anything
else is unbearable!'"

313
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:36,620
FLANDERS:
Excuse me?

314
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:37,988
With all this racket,

315
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:40,423
my boys can't get
their 16 hours sleep.

316
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:42,175
(both muttering)

317
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:44,094
(organ playing "Charge")

318
00:14:44,161 --> 00:14:46,329
So, because of your
on-base percentage, Nelson,

319
00:14:46,397 --> 00:14:48,415
you're the new leadoff
hitter. Questions?

320
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:50,066
When's Bart
coming back?

321
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:51,468
He's not.
He thought he was better

322
00:14:51,535 --> 00:14:53,403
than the laws of probability.

323
00:14:53,471 --> 00:14:55,972
Anyone else think he's better
than the laws of probability?

324
00:14:58,326 --> 00:15:00,226
Well, you're not!

325
00:15:00,311 --> 00:15:03,446
With me here in the booth is
brand-new color commentator

326
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:06,366
and former Isotots
great, Bart Simpson.

327
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:08,034
Bart, do you
miss the game?

328
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:09,602
No, no, no, no.

329
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,071
I got a lot goin' on.

330
00:15:11,138 --> 00:15:13,173
I'm sure you do.

331
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,577
Milhouse hits a frozen rope
just past the diving shortstop.

332
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:19,012
There's a play
at the plate!

333
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,613
He's... safe.

334
00:15:20,681 --> 00:15:22,882
And that's all
she wrote.

335
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,851
It's a triumph of
number-crunching

336
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:26,152
over the human spirit.

337
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,021
And it's about time.

338
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:30,990
(cheering)

339
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:32,926
(Lisa squeals)

340
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,844
Look, Dad.

341
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,746
"Players and
Coaches Entrance."

342
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,815
Hey, let's hold hands
and skip inside.

343
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:52,451
(both laughing)

344
00:15:52,502 --> 00:15:54,887
Well, let's go
to the bleachers.

345
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,122
I brought an air horn
and a megaphone.

346
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:58,290
Testing...

347
00:15:58,341 --> 00:15:59,308
(horn blows)

348
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,627
Actually, I'm taking you

349
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:06,065
on a "special little guy
super happy fun" day.

350
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,733
Are you taking me
to the dentist?

351
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,452
You're not going
to the dentist.

352
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,770
(Marge mutters)

353
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:16,408
You know, Mom, after only seven
hours in this amusement park,

354
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,143
I'm finally
enjoying myself.

355
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:19,811
I'm actually starting
to forget about...

356
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:21,096
(cell phone rings)

357
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:22,948
Lisa?

358
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,249
She wants to
talk to you.

359
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,334
Hey Lis.

360
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,869
Bart, I need you.

361
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,505
Ralph can't play,
'cause he's too juiced.

362
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:33,726
I didn't know what I was putting
into my body.

363
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,545
Sorry, sis.
I've moved on.

364
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:39,264
And my days of listening
to my manager are over.

365
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,832
Son, you should always listen
to your manager.

366
00:16:40,884 --> 00:16:41,934
(gasps)

367
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,719
Mike Scioscia!

368
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,554
Didn't you get
radiation poisoning

369
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,689
working at the
Springfield Nuclear Plant?

370
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:49,057
I sure did,

371
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,893
and it gave me
super-managing powers!

372
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,895
I also demagnetize
credit cards.

373
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:53,946
(shudders)

374
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,615
Bart, I have
two pieces of advice.

375
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,784
First, keep your arms
in the damn car.

376
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,202
Whoa!

377
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,854
Secondly, I don't care if
your manager is your sister,

378
00:17:02,906 --> 00:17:06,358
Dick Drago's mustache,
or Oscar Gamble's afro.

379
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:08,293
A player should always listen
to his skipper.

380
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,629
That's how I got these three
World Series rings.

381
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,048
(gasping and shuddering)

382
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,716
Never mind that.
I'll win more.

383
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,301
But you owe it to your sister,

384
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,253
and the great game of baseball--

385
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:19,871
wacky face for the camera--

386
00:17:19,923 --> 00:17:23,091
to go back
and help your team.

387
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:24,626
Now, who wants
funnel cake?

388
00:17:24,694 --> 00:17:27,062
You got some great
raw ingredients, kid.

389
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,380
Open up your
stance a little.

390
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:31,767
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

391
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,101
That's okay.

392
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,137
You just didn't
have it today.

393
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:37,089
Not everything's
baseball.

394
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,524
Yes, it is.

395
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,993
(typing)

396
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,662
Oh! What am I gonna do?

397
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,697
I need a pinch-runner
with speed!

398
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:48,050
How about a benchwarmer
who's afraid of puppets?

399
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:49,218
(groans)

400
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:51,587
Did someone order
a happy ending?

401
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,788
Bart!

402
00:17:52,856 --> 00:17:54,456
Oh!

403
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:58,494
Now get out there
and kick a field goal!

404
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:01,163
(chuckles)
Kidding.

405
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:03,732
ANNOUNCER: And that's why anyone
who invested with Lenny Dykstra

406
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,567
really should call that number.

407
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:07,035
Lawyers are standing by.

408
00:18:07,103 --> 00:18:09,638
Simpson on first,
taking a big lead.

409
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:12,107
Oh, looks like he's
gonna swipe the bag.

410
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,609
No, no.

411
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,310
Don't steal.

412
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:25,821
(crowd cheering)

413
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:27,072
ANNOUNCER:
And there he goes!

414
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,816
He's stealing third.

415
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:40,586
Okay, okay, he's stolen third.

416
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,821
But surely, that's the limit
of his cockiness.

417
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,224
I'm stealing home!

418
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,778
No! The computer says
it's statistically impossible!

419
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:51,246
Bah.
Computers.

420
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:53,465
They'll never replace my
Huffnagle autocollator!

421
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,167
Crank it, Smithers.
Crank it!

422
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,002
It's, uh, seizing up, sir.

423
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,204
Yes, well apply
more goose grease.

424
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,490
(cheering)

425
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:04,976
Stealing home.
It's so impossible.

426
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:07,329
It's against every
sensible instinct.

427
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:08,664
It's, it's...

428
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,136
(crowd cheering)

429
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:16,038
(autocollator shattering)

430
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:19,207
It's the most exciting
play in baseball.

431
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,510
Go, Bart!

432
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,430
If he makes it,
that's my son!

433
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,673
You're out!
(crowd gasping)

434
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,509
The Isotots lose.

435
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:41,630
Now to begin my off-season
job: follow-home robberies.

436
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:43,265
I'll see you in
the parking lot,

437
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,952
but you won't see me
until it's too late.

438
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,588
HOMER:
You stink!
(grunts)

439
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:53,325
Did I make it?

440
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:54,476
No.

441
00:19:54,544 --> 00:19:55,961
But you did
do something.

442
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,130
You made me
love baseball.

443
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,415
Not as a collection
of numbers,

444
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,302
but as an unpredictable,
passionate game

445
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,722
beaten in excitement only
by every other sport.

446
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,974
I guess your
computer was right.

447
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,944
Maybe it was, but according
to my calculations,

448
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:15,280
you're a great brother
51 % of the time.

449
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,350
And according
to my gut, you're okay, too.

450
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:19,651
Can you put a number on it?

451
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:25,574
Aww...

452
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:31,463
TEAM:
Conflict resolved.
Conflict resolved.

453
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,248
