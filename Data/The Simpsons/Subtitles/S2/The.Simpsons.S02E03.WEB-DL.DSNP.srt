00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:04,879
(clears throat)
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:08,550
You know, Halloween
is a very strange holiday.

3
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:11,344
Personally,
I don't understand it.

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,597
Kids worshipping ghosts,
pretending to be devils.

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,642
Things on TV that
are completely inappropriate

6
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,436
for younger viewers.

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,105
Things like
the following half-hour.

8
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,898
Nothing seems to bother
my kids,

9
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,191
but tonight's show--

10
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,735
which I totally
wash my hands of--

11
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,695
is really scary.

12
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,405
So, if you have
sensitive children,

13
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:33,408
maybe you should tuck them
into bed early tonight

14
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,661
instead of writing us
angry letters tomorrow.

15
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,830
Thanks for your attention.

16
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,792
♪♪

17
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,387
(screams and howls)

18
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,111
Ooh, what a haul this year.

19
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,863
I love Halloween.

20
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,200
Heh, heh.
Wait a minute.

21
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,869
Let's see what
the kids are up to.

22
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,538
...and the policeman on the
other end of the phone said

23
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,457
"We have traced the call.

24
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,626
"It's coming from
the floor below you.

25
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,461
Get out of the house!"

26
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,505
But it was too late.

27
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,048
End of story.

28
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,050
Yawn. I heard that when
I was in the third grade.

29
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,093
It's not scary.

30
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,135
-Is too!
-Is not.

31
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,178
-Is too!
-Is not!

32
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,262
-Is too.
-Is not!

33
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,598
Fine!
Then you tell one scarier.

34
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,225
Flashlight, please.

35
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:45,396
Here's a story
that's really scarifying.

36
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,397
LISA:
Oh, brother.

37
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,108
I call it...

38
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,862
(Bart laughing maniacally)

39
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,576
That's all of it.
Sign here.

40
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,745
There you are, my man,

41
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,539
and a dollar
for yourself.

42
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,875
A buck. I'm glad there's
a curse on this place.

43
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,918
Huh?

44
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,962
Well, it's all ours.

45
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,548
I still can't believe
how inexpensive it was.

46
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,424
Motivated seller, Marge.

47
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,718
Well, he certainly
must have been motivated.

48
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,429
Prime location,
18 bedrooms, moat.

49
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,265
We shouldn't be able
to afford this.

50
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,308
So we got a good deal
for once.

51
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,269
Quit fighting it.

52
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,187
It just seems too good
to be true.

53
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,816
Ow! Mom, Bart threw
a book at me!

54
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,109
-Did not.
-Did too!

55
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,402
-Did not!
-Did too!

56
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,571
MALE VOICE:
<i>Get out!</i>

57
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,698
MARGE:
What on Earth was that?

58
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,491
Hmm. Probably just
the house settling.

59
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,576
(Marge groans)

60
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,709
Hmm, this kitchen certainly
could use a woman's touch.

61
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,421
Homer!

62
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,173
What's this thing
in the corner?

63
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,675
-I dunno.
-It looks like a vortex--

64
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,052
a gateway
into another dimension.

65
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,305
Ooh, a vortex.

66
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,806
Catch!

67
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,729
Hey, pretty slick.

68
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,064
Huh?

69
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,236
"Quit throwing your garbage
into our dimension."

70
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,656
Mom, Dad!
Help!

71
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,200
(gagging)

72
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,869
MALE VOICE:
<i>Get out.</i>

73
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:27,040
Okay, boy, let's see you
talk yourself out of this one.

74
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,376
I can feel an evil presence
in this house.

75
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,669
-Evil?
-Quiet, Lisa.

76
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,379
You're scaring
your mother.

77
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,132
Children, get your coats.
We're leaving this house right now.

78
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,551
Now wait a minute, Marge.

79
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,345
It's only natural there
would be some things wrong

80
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,846
with an old house
like this.

81
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,390
It's a fixer-upper.

82
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,477
What's the problem?
We get a bunch of priests in here--

83
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,520
I'm not going to live
in a house of evil

84
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,481
just to save a few dollars.

85
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,691
Don't be so stubborn!

86
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,944
We're not talking about
a few dollars.

87
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,447
We're talking about
a few thousand dollars!

88
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,949
(screaming)

89
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,952
Ooh! It's got great
high ceilings.

90
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,828
(screaming)

91
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,039
Tell you what,

92
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:11,292
let's, um, sleep on it, okay?

93
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,003
All right,
but if anything happens--

94
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,213
What could happen?

95
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,089
Mmm...

96
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:24,138
MALE VOICE: <i>They are all</i>
<i>against you, Bart.</i>

97
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,474
<i>You must kill them all.</i>

98
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,560
<i>They all must die.</i>

99
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,437
Are you my conscience?

100
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,106
<i>I...</i>

101
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,692
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

102
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,654
<i>Lisa. Lisa.</i>

103
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:43,074
<i>The butcher knife, Lisa.</i>

104
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,082
They are all against me.

105
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:54,836
They all must die.

106
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,511
Marge.

107
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,722
Oh, Marge?

108
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,267
MARGE:
I'm in the kitchen, Homer.

109
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,111
MALE VOICE:
<i>Die! Die!</i>

110
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,322
<i>Everybody, die.</i>

111
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,325
(maniacal laughter)

112
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,662
(gasping)

113
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,706
What's going on
out here?

114
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,542
Homer, Bart, Lisa, Maggie,
stop it!

115
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,044
-Sorry. Sorry, Bart.
-Sorry, Dad.

116
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,295
Sorry, Mom.
Sorry, Mag.

117
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,338
Well, that does it.

118
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,464
Children, get dressed.
We're leaving.

119
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,758
Ah, c'mon Marge, you said
you'd sleep on it.

120
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,426
I don't care what I said.

121
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,261
This family has had its differences,
and we've squabbled,

122
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,221
but we never had
knife fights before,

123
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,140
and I blame this house.

124
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,809
Mom, Dad, look!

125
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,064
LISA: It's an ancient
Indian burial ground.

126
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:59,025
BART: Man, this place
has got everything.

127
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,693
An ancient Indian what?

128
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,158
Mr. Plute,
Homer Simpson here.

129
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,035
When you sold me this house

130
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,371
you forgot to mention
one little thing.

131
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:16,751
You didn't tell me it was built
on an Indian burial ground!

132
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,754
No. You. Didn't!

133
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,382
Well, that's not
my recollection.

134
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:26,386
Yeah, well--
All right, good-bye.

135
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,097
He says he mentioned it
five or six times.

136
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,556
Let's go, children.

137
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,141
-Aw, gee, Marge.
-Homer--

138
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,893
MALE VOICE:
<i>You will die.</i>

139
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,562
<i>You will die slowly.</i>

140
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,815
<i>Your stomach will swell.</i>

141
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,318
<i>Your intestines</i>
<i>will writhe and boil.</i>

142
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,570
<i>Your eyes will burst</i>

143
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,906
<i>and some horrible stuff--</i>

144
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,699
<i>possibly your brains--</i>

145
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,078
<i>will start coming out</i>
<i>through your nose.</i>

146
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,122
Shush! Shut up!

147
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,666
Quit trying to push us around!

148
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,460
Stop saying
those horrible things

149
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,546
and show some manners!

150
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,678
Look at me.
I've never been so angry.

151
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,513
My hands are shaking.

152
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,348
Better than
your eyes bursting.

153
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,100
-Do it again.
<i>-What?</i>

154
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,185
-Make the walls bleed.
<i>-No.</i>

155
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,855
Hey, man, we own you.
Let's see some blood.

156
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,023
<i>I don't have to</i>
<i>entertain you.</i>

157
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,025
Come on, man, do it.
Do the blood thing.

158
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,361
C'mon! Do it! Do it! Do it!
Do it! Do it! Do it!

159
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,280
Why are you
trying to scare us?

160
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,240
Are you trying to keep us
from getting close to you?

161
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,242
Maybe even loving you?

162
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,493
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

163
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,828
Don't talk to her
like that.

164
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,079
<i>Hey listen, lady...</i>

165
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,956
Don't call me lady.

166
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,875
My name is Marge Simpson.

167
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,878
This is my family
and we're not going anywhere.

168
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,796
We're all going
to have to live together

169
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,133
so you better
get used to it. Please.

170
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,428
<i>Can I have a minute</i>
<i>to think about this?</i>

171
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,471
Sure.

172
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,393
<i>Hmm...</i>

173
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,645
<i>Life with the Simpsons.</i>

174
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,814
<i>What choice do I have?</i>

175
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,984
(rumbling)

176
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,239
-HOMER: Wow.
-BART: Bitchin'!

177
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,908
It chose to destroy itself

178
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,534
rather than live with us.

179
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,745
You can't help
but feel a little rejected.

180
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,669
-(Homer shudders)
-LISA: That wasn't scary at all, Bart.

181
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,130
Oh yeah? Well, how about...

182
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,673
this severed finger?!

183
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,554
-Eww, baby spit!
-(laughing)

184
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,098
Well, that last story
was just a warm-up

185
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,060
for this macabre tale
which I call...

186
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,860
Homer, all these flies.

187
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,612
Not to worry.

188
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,197
I'll just turn on
the trusty bug zapper.

189
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,408
-(flies buzzing)
-(zapping)

190
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,953
Ooh, that was a big mama.
Heh-heh-heh.

191
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,539
(humming)

192
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,928
That should just about do it.

193
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,097
Man alive,
there's nothing better

194
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,224
than a hamburger grilled
to perfection--

195
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,186
Cool, man!

196
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,189
(gasping)

197
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,577
Your burgers
are getting cold, guy--

198
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,245
Holy moly.

199
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,210
(screaming)

200
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,212
(screaming)

201
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,380
(screaming)

202
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,423
Huh?

203
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,031
(quivering)

204
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,324
Greetings, Earthlings.

205
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,702
I am Kang.
Do not be frightened.

206
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,413
We mean you no harm.

207
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,873
You speak English.

208
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,042
I am actually
speaking Rigellian.

209
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,543
By an astonishing
coincidence,

210
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,129
both of our languages
are exactly the same.

211
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,797
Well, what are you gonna
do with us, man?

212
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,425
Kodos and I are taking you
to Rigel Four--

213
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:38,471
a world of infinite delights
to tantalize your senses

214
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,515
and challenge
your intellectual limitations.

215
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,225
Look, I know that to you

216
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,269
we Simpsons are
a lower order of life.

217
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,314
We face that prejudice
every day of our lives,

218
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,399
but we are happy
on our little planet.

219
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,401
We throw ourselves
on your mercy.

220
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,695
-Please return us to--
-KODOS: Dinnertime.

221
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,739
Hey, get a load
of that spread.

222
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,115
Here you go, Earthlings.

223
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,576
Take all you want,
but eat all you take.

224
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,578
Well, thank you
very much, mister...?

225
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,747
To pronounce it correctly,

226
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,667
I would have to
pull out your tongue.

227
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,043
Eww.

228
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,755
-Fried shrimp.
-Sloppy Joes.

229
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,590
Smothered pork chops.

230
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,884
Look Homer,
radish rosettes.

231
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,302
These are hard to make.

232
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,179
They're a very advanced race.

233
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,683
Come, Earthlings, eat.
Grow large with food.

234
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,980
There's something
not quite right about this.

235
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,732
The girl's right.

236
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,443
Let's get some applesauce
out here for these pork chops.

237
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,363
What are you
looking at, buddy?

238
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,116
Your wife is
quite a dish.

239
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,785
Ooh, thanks.

240
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,371
KANG: It is our great
pleasure to provide you

241
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,248
with unlimited
entertainment on your...

242
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,917
intergalactic journey.

243
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,169
On this cable system,
we receive over one million

244
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,630
channels from the furthest
reaches of the galaxy.

245
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,840
You get HBO?

246
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,258
No. That would cost extra.

247
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,510
And over here is
our crowning achievement

248
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,929
in amusement technology--
an electronic version

249
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,014
of what you call table tennis.

250
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,434
Your primitive paddles
have been replaced by an electronic--

251
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,061
Hey, that's just Pong.
Get with the times, man.

252
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,356
Marge and I played that old
game before we were married.

253
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,358
Well, we did build
this spaceship, you know.

254
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,901
Anyone from a species

255
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,278
that has mastered
intergalactic travel,

256
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,196
raise your hand.

257
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,620
All right, then.

258
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,331
Sorry.
Your game is very nice.

259
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,878
Dinnertime.

260
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,838
Hey, how come we
never see you guys eat?

261
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,717
Oh, we wouldn't
want to spoil our appetite

262
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,221
for... the great feast
when we land on Rigel Four.

263
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,765
Ooh, a feast!

264
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,224
Will we be invited?

265
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,518
Oh, you'll be at the feast.

266
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:53,189
I have a feeling
you'll be the guests of honor.

267
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,066
(ominous laughter)

268
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,818
Tell us more about this feast.

269
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,111
No, no, eat now.

270
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,613
When we arrive,

271
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,490
there will be
plenty of time

272
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,909
to chew the fat.

273
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,537
(laughter)

274
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,460
Very good, Earth boy.

275
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,798
(oohing and ahhing)

276
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,510
Excellent, Mr. Simpson.
Excellent.

277
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,894
(gasps)

278
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,524
This will give the humans
the perfect flavor.

279
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,115
(gasps)

280
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,997
Stop!

281
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,582
Don't you see
what's happening here?

282
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,377
They're fattening us up
so they can eat us!

283
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,170
Oh, come on, Lisa.

284
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,880
If you don't believe me,

285
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:00,923
then just look at this book
that I found.

286
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:01,924
(all gasp)

287
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,052
Look! She's right!

288
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,846
Humans,
you have stopped eating.

289
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,348
Listen, you big, stupid
space creature.

290
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,686
Nobody, but nobody
eats the Simpsons.

291
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,437
-I beg your pardon?
-Don't play dumb with me.

292
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,772
We found your book.

293
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,023
You mean this?

294
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,442
It's a harmless cookbook.

295
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,319
It's just a little dusty.

296
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,782
(sighs of relief)

297
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,661
Wait a minute.

298
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,332
-Aha!
-(gasping)

299
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,711
Wait. There's still more
space dust on here.

300
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,672
(sighs of relief)

301
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,425
Let me get this straight.
You thought--

302
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,510
They thought we were
going to eat them.

303
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,179
Good God, is this
some kind of joke?

304
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,016
No. They're serious.

305
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,685
Well why were you trying
to make us eat all the time?

306
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,730
Make you eat? We merely
provided a sumptuous banquet,

307
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,983
and, frankly, you people
made pigs of yourselves.

308
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,694
I slaved in the kitchen
for days

309
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,155
for you people and--

310
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,991
Well, if you wanted to make
Shiroc the Preparer cry,

311
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,035
mission accomplished.

312
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:14,997
SHIROC: You aren't the only beings
who have emotions, you know.

313
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,590
We offered you paradise.

314
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,133
You would have
experienced emotions

315
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,345
100 times greater
than what you call love,

316
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,056
and 1000 times greater
than what you call fun.

317
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,516
You would have been
treated like gods

318
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,019
and lived forever
in beauty,

319
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:41,106
but, now, because of
your distrustful nature,

320
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,274
that can never be.

321
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,319
For a superior race,
they really rub it in.

322
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,867
There were monsters
on that ship,

323
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,827
and truly we were them.

324
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,412
MARGE: Lisa, see what we mean
when we say

325
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,539
you're too smart
for your own good?

326
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,792
-BART: Way to go, Lise.
-HOMER: Yeah, thanks, Lisa.

327
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,876
(Marge groans)

328
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,340
(gagging)

329
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,676
Hello.
Something scary happening.

330
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,679
(gagging)

331
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,765
Hey, Poindexter,
it's Halloween.

332
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,517
Put the book away.

333
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,977
For your information,

334
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,688
I'm about to read you
a classic tale of terror

335
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,523
by Edgar Allan Poe.

336
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,942
Wait a minute.
That's a school book.

337
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,986
Don't worry, Bart,
you won't learn anything.

338
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,737
It's called...

339
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,617
"Once upon a midnight dreary...

340
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,245
NARRATOR: <i>"While I pondered,</i>
<i>weak and weary</i>

-(tapping at door)
-(Homer shrieks)

346
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,089
<i>"as of some one</i>
<i>gently rapping,</i>

347
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,757

Only this, and nothing more."

BART:
Are we scared yet?

352
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,019
LISA: Bart,
he's establishing mood.
