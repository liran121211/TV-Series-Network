A six-month supply

Great, great, great.
How much? How much? How much?

48
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,208
$1,000.

49
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,710
A thousand bucks?!

50
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,461
I can't afford that.

51
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,589
Well, we do have a product

52
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,632
which is more
in your price range.

53
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,467
However, I must assure
you that any hair growth

54
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,760
you experience
while using it

55
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,554
will be purely coincidental.

56
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,723
A thousand bucks...

57
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,224
Of all the rip-off

58
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,268
screw job,
gyp joint...

59
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,479
(cries)
Forget you, pal.

60
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,023
Thanks for nothing.

61
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,232
(sobbing)

62
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,277
So I say, "Forget you, pal!

63
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,737
Thanks for nothing!"

64
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,905
and I stormed
right out of there.

65
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,781
Ha! That's telling him, Homer.

66
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,827
D'oh! I'm out of tartar sauce.
They call this a portion?

67
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,496
Hey, Lenny, are you going to use
all of your tartar sauce?

68
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,373
Dry fish sticks.
This sucks.

69
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,458
Quit complaining, chrome dome.

70
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,084
Oh! If I had hair,

71
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,086
you wouldn't be
calling me that.

72
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,047
LENNY: Homer, don't be
a sap all of your life.

73
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,925
Just fill out a few medical
insurance forms creatively.

74
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,635
Charge that Dimoxinil stuff
to the company.

75
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,928
But it's a thousand bucks.

76
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,846
Burns would can my butt
in no time flat.

77
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,057
Ooh, a thousand bucks!
So what?

78
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,559
To Mr. Burns, that's one
less ivory back scratcher.

79
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,520
Yeah. Besides, you pay money
into the insurance fund every week.

80
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,855
What do you ever
get out of it?

81
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,899
Nothing.
Well, that newsletter.

82
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,859
Exactly.
Why should you get nothing

83
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,737
while some guy who loses
a finger hits the jackpot?

84
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,280
You got me.

85
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,492
Uh, I'd like to charge
that Dimoxinil stuff

86
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,577
to my health insurance.

87
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,330
Look buddy, I don't know
who put you up to this

88
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,666
but no insurance plan
in this state

89
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,211
covers something
as frivolous as Dimoxinil.

00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,380

111
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,754
-Dimoxinil!
-Dimoxinil!

121
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,126
and, well,
just between us girls

122
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,046
well, he hasn't been
this frisky in years.

123
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,964
I don't want
to think about it.

beautiful women.

129
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,355
I must be in heaven.

Oh, my.

131
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,484
Patty,
stop drooling.

132
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,777
Heh.
Look who's talking.

133
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,659
Hey, there's something's
different about you, Homer.

134
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,993
Did you lose some weight?

135
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,121
Yeah, you look like
you got a tan or something.

136
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,705
I know what it is.
A new tie.

137
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,082
(Homer laughing)

138
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,668
BURNS: Morons, pathetic morons
in my employ,

139
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,628
stealing my precious money.

140
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,381
This is hopeless. None of these
cretins deserves a promotion.

141
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,049
It's in the union
contract, sir.

142
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,510
One token promotion
from within per year.

143
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,388
Wait! Who is that
young go-getter?

144
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,640
SMITHERS: Well, it sort of
looks like Homer Simpson

145
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,809
only more dynamic
and resourceful.

146
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,228
Simpson, huh?
Hmm.

147
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,398
An unspoiled lump of clay

<i>to a better life.</i>

155
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,545
Well, your resume
seems in order.

156
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,213
Besides typing and stuff

157
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,382
do you have any other qualifications
I should know about?

158
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,468

159

Here, let me show you.

160
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,220
Uh, no, no.
That'll be fine.

161
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,764

Oh Marge, every woman
I interview

166
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,023

makes kissy faces at me.

167
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:02,899
Hmm...

168
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,027
Hello, Mr. Simpson.
I'm Karl.

169
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,737
He sounds good. Hire him.

-Simpson.

173
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,244
Yes, Mr. Smithers.

174
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,079
He thinks he's so big.

175
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,040
-You don't belong here.
-Huh?

176
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,709
You don't belong here.

177
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,503
You're a fraud,
and a phony,

178
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,671
and it's only a matter of time
until they find you out.

179
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,590
-(gasps) Who told you?
-You did.

180
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,675
You told me with the way
you slump your shoulders.

181
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,177
The way you talk
into your chest.

182
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,762
The way you
smother yourself

183
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,515
in bargain basement
lime green polyester.

184
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,433
I want you
to say to yourself

185
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,185
"I deserve this."

186
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,645
"I love it."

187
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,231
"I am nature's
greatest miracle."

188
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,482
Go ahead, say it.

189
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,900
-I-I deser...
-Trust me, Homer.

190
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,236
-I-- Uh...
-Take a step and say it!

191
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,612
I... deserve this.

192
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,113
-Louder!
-I deserve this!

193
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,867
-Shout it!
-I am nature's greatest miracle!

194
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,119
I'll need three weeks vacation
and moving expenses.

195
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,496
You've got it, buddy!

196
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,373
Let's go shopping!

197
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,714
(gasps)
Ooh... beauty.

198
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,966
A man's suit

199
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,509
should make him
feel like a prince.

200
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,720
It should cry out to
the world, "Here I am."

201
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,347
"Don't judge me. Love me."

202
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,182
Do any of these
suits do that?

203
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,350
No.

204
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,687
Woo! I like this.

205
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,523
No, no, no,
stand naturally, Mr. Simpson.

206
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,233
Let it all
hang out.

207
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,319
You, conceal it.

208
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,906
(Marge humming)

209
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,618
Mom and Dad
have been smooching again.

210
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,161
Got to run, Marge.
Can't be late!

211
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,080
Happy Anniversary, Homer.

212
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,874
What? Our anniversary?
Are you sure?

213
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,459
Well, don't worry, Homie.

214
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,753
This year you have an excuse
for not remembering

215
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,088
-what with your job and--
-(knock on door)

216
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,090
Happy Anniversary,
Mrs. Homer Simpson!

217
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,968
<i>♪ You are so beautiful ♪</i>

218
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:57,388
<i>♪ to me, yeah ♪</i>

219
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,266
<i>♪ You are so beautiful ♪</i>

220
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,601
<i>♪ to me ♪</i>

221
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,977
<i>♪ Can't you see ♪</i>

222
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,145
-Oh, Homer.
-(telephone rings)

223
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,648
-Hello?
-Mr. Simpson, it's Karl.

224
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,526
Ah, it sounds like
everything has arrived.

225
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,403
-Wonderful.
-You did this?

226
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,905
Yes, sir. I hope I didn't
overstep my bounds.

227
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,700
<i>♪ You are so beautiful ♪</i>

228
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,037
<i>♪ to me ♪</i>

229
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,039
I love you, Homer!

230
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,208
I love you, Karl--
Uh, Marge.

231
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,293
Proceed, Smithers.

232
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,794
Our first issue, sir,

233
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,254
is our low productivity

234
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,006
and record-high
worker accident rate.

235
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,425
Guh! Any suggestions?

236
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,510
A round of layoffs might
wake up the idiots.

237
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,304
We could put caffeine
in the water cooler.

238
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,056
Hmm, well, those
are my ideas!

239
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,183
You people don't think,
you regurgitate!

240
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,769
That's why I promoted someone
who's in touch with the workers.

241
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,729
-You.
-I think you mean him, sir.

242
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,857
You then. How would you improve
the workers' situation?

243
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,610
Well, I--
Well, sir, for one thing,

244
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,362
we had a problem
every Tuesday

245
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,280
when the cafeteria
would serve fish sticks.

246
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,574
Fish sticks! What in blazes
are you talking about?

247
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,493
Well sir, they cut
the head off the fish

248
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,411
and chop up the rest into sticks and
then put seasoned bread crumbs--

249
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,539
I know what fish sticks are!
Get to the point!

250
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,125
Well, you only get
this tiny

251
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,544
little cup of tartar sauce to dip 'em in
and I always run out.

252
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,754
Will you stop
wasting our time, Simpson?

253
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,214
Shut up, Smithers.

254
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,590
Can't you see
what he's saying?

255
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,592
A happy worker
is a busy worker.

256
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,386
Three cents' worth
of tartar sauce

257
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,596
could save us thousands
of man-hours in labor.

258
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,932
I like the cut
of your jib, Simpson.

259
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:27,144
Let the fools
have their tartar sauce.

260
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,980
HOMER: Enjoy your tartar sauce,
boys. Enjoy!

261
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,441
Give me your plates.
Don't crowd.

262
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,943
Plenty for everybody!

263
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,822
Hmm, brilliant.

264
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,658
Who could ever have imagined
that Simpson's sweeping reforms

265
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,660
would pay off so quickly?

266
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,621
You know sir, accidents decreased
by exactly the number

267
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,374
that Simpson himself has known
or suspected to have caused last month.

268
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,376
And our output level
was just as high

269
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,961
during Simpson's
last vacation.

270
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,171
My dear, tired old Smithers...

271
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,465
do I detect a note of jealousy?

272
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,008
(laughing)

273
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,677
It is time.

274
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,805
Give Simpson...
the key.

275
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,475
KARL: Mr. Simpson don't sit on that
filthy thing one second longer.

276
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,229
They've given you... the key.

277
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,897
HOMER (gasps):
The key?!

278
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,357
-He's got the key.
-Who's got the key?

279
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,696
(all gasping)

280
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,040
(bird chirping)

281
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:34,420
KARL: Stunning.
Absolutely stunning.

282
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,629
(toilet flushes)

283
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,173
Oh! Hey, ho, men.

284
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,799
You know I was watching
the Dumont last night

285
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,468
and I happened to catch
a fascinating documentary

286
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,428
on Rommel, The Desert Fox.

287
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,430
Now there's a man
who could get things done.

288
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,890
Towel, please, Simpson.

289
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,350
-Allow me, sir.
-I said Simpson.

290
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,645
Uh... sure thing,
Mr. Burns.

291
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,105
Well done, Simpson.

292
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,690
Now walk behind me
down the hallway.

293
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,442
Can do, sir.

294
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,637
SMITHERS: Hmm.

295
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,390
"$1,000?

296
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,558
"Dimoxinil?

297
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,560
Keep brain from freezing?"

298
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,687
Now I've got you, Simpson.

299
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,147
(laughing)

300
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:43,531
MARGE: Hmm Homer, between your hair
care products and new wardrobe

301
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,491
we're not saving anything
for a rainy day.

302
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,536
Rainy day! There's never going
to be a rainy day, Marge.

303
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,121
There's not a cloud
in the Simpson sky.

304
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,082
And what does
my little girl want?

305
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,960
An absence of mood swings
and some stability in my life.

306
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,837
Uh... how about a pony?

307
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,963
Okay.

308
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,756
BURNS:
I want you to weave

309
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,425
that patented Simpson magic
with my executives.

310
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,511
A short speech. Work, work, work.
You know.

311
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,720
Uh, well, okay.
What the hey?

312
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,431
Excellent. Set you
to your task, Simpson.

313
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,812
Hmm. Uh, Mr. Burns,
it is my sad duty

314
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,522
to report that one
of your executives

315
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,274
has bilked the company
insurance plan out of $1,000.

316
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,151
What?
Blast his hide to Hades!

317
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,655
Ooh! and I was going to buy
that ivory back scratcher.

318
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,865
How did he do it?

319
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,741
He charged the company
for Dimoxinil.

320
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,951
It's a baldness cure.

321
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,953
Thank you very much,
professor science.

322
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,788
I know what Dimoxinil is.

323
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,708
Now, go and make an example
of this hooligan.

324
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,918
With pleasure, sir.

325
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,671
Karl, you got to help me.
Mr. Burns wants me

326
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,965
to make some speech
to his executives, and--

327
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,174
-Ahem.
-What do you want?

328
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,467
Oh, just thought
I'd drop by

329
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,303
-to tell you that you're fired.
-What?

330
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,180
Our company does not
look kindly upon $1,000

331
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,557
worth of insurance fraud.

332
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,933
Clean out your desk
by noon, Simpson.

333
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,310
(moans)

334
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,187
Wait, Mr. Smithers.
Homer Simpson is innocent.

335
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,814
I did this.

336
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,190
-You did?
-What are you talking about?

337
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,651
Mr. Simpson was unaware
of any impropriety.

338
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,778
I take full responsibility.

339
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,989
Really? Oh.

340
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,992
Well, then... you're fired,
whoever you are.

341
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,827
Here's your $1,000.

342
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,539
(groans) Hey, what do you care
if this guy's bald?

343
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,167
My reasons... are my own.

344
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,588
Karl, you saved me. Why?

345
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:26,008
Have I done something
extraordinary here today?

346
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,178
No. I did what
I was born to do.

347
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,096
What any good soldier
would have done

348
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,724
when a live grenade
threatened his commander.

349
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:38,312
I threw myself upon it
and bore its terrible brunt.

350
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,064
Oh, thanks, Karl.

351
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,650
I don't know what to say.

352
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,276
Just walk me to my car.

353
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,448
Bye, Karl.
I'm going to miss you.

354
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,866
Bye, Mr. Simpson.

355
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,040
Oh, Mr. Simpson, did you
bring an umbrella today?

356
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,125
D'oh! No.

357
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,293
Here.

358
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,423
(Karl sneezes)

359
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,305
Okay, okay, okay, you're broke.
You're flat broke.

360
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,724
You don't have Karl anymore.
He's not here, but you've got your hair.

361
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,017
That's right.
It's all about hair.

362
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,936
Oh, that big speech.

363
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,020
(thunder rumbles)

364
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,485
Oh-ho.

365
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,283
BART: Hey, what's happening,
hep cats?

366
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,619
-No way!
-It's gotta be a fake.

367
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,665
It's like realsville,
Daddy-o. Heh.

368
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,921
Bart!
What are you doing?

369
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:46,964
Uh-oh.

370
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,173
-Aah!
-Aah!

371
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,550
-Why, you little...
-Uh-oh.

372
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,301
-(growls)
-(Bart screaming)

373
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,553
(Homer shouting incoherently)

374
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,513
Aah!

375
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,557
Boy... must... die!

376
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,308
I love you, Dad.

377
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,395
D'oh!
Dirty trick.

378
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,814
Okay. I'm not gonna kill you,

379
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,524
but I'm going to
tell you three things

380
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,484
that are going to haunt you
for the rest of your days.

381
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,944
You've ruined your father.

382
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,654
You've crippled your family,

383
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,990
and baldness is hereditary.

384
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,533
It is?!

385
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,663
(sobbing)

386
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,374
Oh, Homer, why don't you
just call the pharmacy and--

387
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,959
I don't have 1,000 bucks!

388
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,003
But you do, don't you, Marge?
You do. You do.

389
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,047
You've been squirreling it
away, haven't you?

390
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,340
Saving it for a rainy day, that's what
you've said, right, right, right?

391
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,717
Homer!

392
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,844
(sobbing)

393
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,472
Dad is taking this
in a less-than-heroic fashion.

394
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,903
Oh, Homie, I'm so sorry.

395
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,613
(shuddering sigh)

396
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,407
Got that big speech in
five minutes, Simpson, huh?

397
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,202
You're not going
to hang yourself, are you?

398
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,620
D'oh!

399
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,121
Huh?

400
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,458
KARL:
"Dear Mr. Simpson

401
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,543
"I've taken the liberty
of preparing your speech

402
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,796
"on the enclosed
numbered three-by-five cards.

403
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,714
"all the big words
are spelled...

404
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,466
"pho-en-ne-net-tically.

405
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,259
"God bless you.

406
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:18,180
"You are one of Springfield's
very special creatures.

407
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,558
Your obedient servant, Karl."

408
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,601
Good luck, sir.

409
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,811
Ah! Karl.

410
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,229
So that wasn't just
a sweet voice

411
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,606
I heard inside my head.
What are you doing here?

412
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,192
I just came to say good-bye
to the gals in the typing pool.

413
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,569
Yeah, well.
Thanks for the speech, Karl

414
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,780
but I can't give it.
Look at me.

415
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,615
I guess I haven't
taught you anything.

416
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,408
-What do you mean?
-Don't you see?

417
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,244
The tartar sauce,
the bathroom key,

418
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,204
drying your boss's hands.

419
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,498
You did it all.
It was never the hair.

420
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,501
You did it because you believed
you could, and you still can.

421
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,253
No, I can't.
I'm just a big fool.

422
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,838
-Oh no, you're not.
-How do you know?

423
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,424
Because my mother taught me
never to kiss a fool.

424
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,592
Karl.

425
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,678
Now go get them, tiger.

426
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,679
(growls)

427
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,058
<i>And now, with some</i>
<i>fresh insights,</i>

428
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,186
<i>one of the rising young stars</i>
<i>of our nuclear family,</i>

429
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,688
<i>Homer Simpson.</i>

430
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,940
(applause)

431
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,234
What in blazes?
Who is that old geezer?

432
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,694
And what has he done
with Homer Simpson?

433
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,196
He is Homer Simpson, sir.

434
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,239
(clears throat)

435
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,866
<i>Uh, a lot of you</i>

436
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,118
<i>would think I was crazy</i>
<i>if I did this.</i>

437
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,327
He's crazy!

438
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,704
<i>Yet we at this power plant</i>

439
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,539
<i>are doing this</i>
<i>every hour of every day.</i>

440
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,792
<i>Bloated inventories,</i>
<i>outmoded production methods.</i>

441
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,087
<i>I can save this company</i>
<i>millions of dollars a year.</i>

442
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,214
<i>How?</i>
<i>Through Jiko Kandri</i>

443
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,633
<i>the Japanese art</i>
<i>of self-management.</i>

444
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,760
This bald man
has no ideas.

445
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,637
If this is a joke,
I'm not laughing.

446
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,056
Some nerve, telling us
how to run the plant.

447
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,433
He doesn't even have hair.

448
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,268
<i>...inefficiently</i>
<i>mining uranium</i>

449
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,854
<i>that can be purchased quite</i>
<i>cheaply on the foreign markets.</i>

450
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,772
<i>The long-term benefits</i>

451
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,649
<i>more than offsetting</i>
<i>the one-time cost</i>

452
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,111
<i>for a net savings</i>
<i>of five thousand, two...</i>

453
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,322
(mumbling)

454
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,406
...lots of money.

455
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,658
Mr. Burns' office.
Right now.

456
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,538
Dead man coming through.

457
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,956
MR. BURNS:
Well, well, well

458
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,001
our dashing
young "junior" executive.

459
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,087
You made a hollow mockery of
our morning meeting, Simpson.

460
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,256
I should fire you on the spot.

461
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,800
But...
I'm not going to.

462
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,886
Uh, why?

463
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,804
Simpsons, how old
do you think I am?

464
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,182
I don't know. 102?

465
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,517
I'm only 81.

466
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,103
You may find this
hard to believe

467
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,815
but in my salad days,
my crowning glory

468
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,319
was a bright shock
of strawberry blonde curls.

469
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,739
Oh, I was big man on campus
until my senior year,

470
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,283
when I became as bald
as a plucked chicken.

471
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,868
You see, Simpson

472
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:50,123
I, too, know the sting
of male pattern baldness.

473
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,335
That's why I'm giving you
your old job back.

474
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,004
What? Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

475
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,131
Now get out of here
before I reconsider.

476
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,509
Oh. Better hurry up.

477
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,137
(Homer mumbling)

478
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,306
Homer, are you
still awake?

479
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,308
I've never been
more awake in my life.

480
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,434
What's wrong?

481
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,936
Are you kidding?

482
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,981
I'm stuck
in that dead-end job again.

483
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,816
The kids are going to hate me

484
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,694
'cause I can't buy 'em
all that stuff I promised them,

485
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,196
and you're not going
to love me as much

486
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,824
'cause I'm ugly and bald.

487
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,325
Oh, Homer.

488
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,495
Your job has always
put food on our table

489
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,539
and the kids
will get over it.

490
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,165
And?

491
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,167
And what about loving me?

492
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,253
Oh, Homer, I--

493
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,838
-Come here.
-Why?

494
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,840
