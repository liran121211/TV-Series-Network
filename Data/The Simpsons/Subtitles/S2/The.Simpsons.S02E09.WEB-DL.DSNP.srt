In preparing for this debate,
I did a little research,

248
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,375
and I discovered
a startling thing.

249
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,002
There was violence in the past

250
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,296

were invented.

00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,630
I see. Fascinating.

252
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,757
Yeah, and there was
something called

00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,510
Tremendous violence,
many people killed!

255
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,928
The darned thing went on
for 30 years.

256
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,264

260
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,354

comment on all this?

261
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:56,066
Well Kent, to me, the hijinks
of a few comic characters

262
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,985
absolutely pale in comparison

263
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,320

emotional problems

266
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,286
fear of winning, sex-aholism,
stuff like that.

267
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,330
So you have
no professional objection

268
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,123

269
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,919
No, not at all. In fact, one
of my guilty little pleasures

270
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,088
is to snuggle up with a big
bucket of buttered popcorn,

271

dim the lights, turn on "Itchy and
Scratchy," and laugh myself silly.

-It's a masterpiece.
-It's filth.

394
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,515
It graphically portrays
parts of the human body

395
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,268
which, practical as
they may be, are evil.

396

Now, Mrs. Simpson, why are
you against this statue?

I guess one person
can make a difference,

they probably shouldn't.
