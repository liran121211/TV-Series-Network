Now, now, Homer

Bart's busy working
on his science project.

You heard the lady, Homer
so please mow quietly.

18
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,974
Genius at work.

19
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,355
1:00, still just a potato.

20
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,150
Hey there, neighbor.

21
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,861
The Lord's certainly given us
a beautiful day today, huh?

22
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,364
-Hello, Flanders.
-Doing a little yard work, huh?

23
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,658
Who told?
Marge, beer me.

24
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,368
Say, Simpson

25
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,037
I've got some
time-released granules

26
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,040
that will get rid of that
crabgrass in just half a jiff.

27
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,376
Crabgrass?
What are you talking about?

28
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,629
-Where?
-Well, there, there...

29
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,173
and there's
a big patch over there.

30
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,384
There's nothing wrong
with crabgrass.

31
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,052
It just has a bad name,
that's all.

32
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,595
Everyone would love it

33
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,806
if it had a cute name
like "elfgrass."

34
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,724
(chuckles)
Well, you may be right.

35
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,061
-Marge, where's the Duff?
-Oh, we're all out, Homer.

36
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,230
-D'oh!
-Would you like some fruit juice?

37
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,274
Don't toy with me, woman.

38
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,651
I couldn't help
overhearing, Simpson.

39
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,362
I've got some ice-cold suds
in the rumpus room

40
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,488
if you'd like to join me.

41
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,991
Well, uh, okay, what the heck?

42
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,160
I've earned a little break.

43
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,204
(gasps)
Holy moly.

44
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,165
It's beautiful.

45
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,833
Say, that's right.

46
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,627
This is your first visit
to the Flanders homestead.

47
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,254
Well, we've
only been neighbors what?

48
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,382
(muttering)
Eight years.

49
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,551
There's my little popcorn ball.

50
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,677
Kissy-kissy.

51
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,095
Oh, hello, sponge cake.

52
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,347
I thought you boys
might be hungry

53
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,391
so I whipped up
some club sandwiches.

54
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,351
Ain't she wonderful, Simpson?

55
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but aren't we
forgetting something, Flanders?

56
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,273
Oh, your beer.
Uh, is draft okay?

57
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,650
Just put in the tap
last week.

58
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,905
Heh heh.
Here's a tasty little lager

59
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,823
that came all the way
from Holland.

60
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,410
Well, beggars can't be choosy.

61
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,704
-(burp)
-Hey, Dad,

62
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,414
thanks for helping me
with my science project.

63
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,750
-Mwah!
-Oh, my pleasure, study buddy.

64
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,169
Aw, I got the best Dad
in the whole world.

65
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,255
NED: Oh, now, you know
how that embarrasses me.

66
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,424
I know. Toodley-doodley.

67
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,052
(sighs) Kids can be
a trial sometimes.

68
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,929
All right,
knock it off!

69
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,639
Knock what off, Simpson?

70
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,059
You've been rubbing
my nose in it since I got here!

71
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,061
Your family is better
than my family!

72
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,105
Your beer comes
from farther away than my beer!

73
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,774
You and your son
like each other!

74
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,944
Your wife's butt is higher
than my wife's butt.

75
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,779
You make me sick!

76
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,656
Simpson, I'm afraid

77
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,241
I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

78
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,034
I hope you understand.

79
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,495
I wouldn't stay on a bet!

80
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,624
One for the road.

81
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,170
(Homer moaning)

82
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,506
Homey, quit tossing.

83
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,757
Sorry, Marge.

84
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,634
But it's just that
I'm still steamed up

85
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,135
about that jerk Flanders.

86
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,097
Lousy, bragging
know-it-all, show-off.

87
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,015
What exactly did he say?

88
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,101
Get this.
He said...

89
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,520
No, he said...

90
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,397
Well, it wasn't so much
what he said,

91
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,439
it was how he said it.

92
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,941
How did he say it?

93
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,402
-Well, he...
-Was he angry?

94
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,736
-No. 
-Was he rude?

95
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,030
Okay, okay.
It wasn't how he said it either,

96
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,532
but the message
was loud and clear.

97
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,826
Our family stinks!

98
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:48,204
Homer, I'm your best friend,
but I've gotta say,

99
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,915
I've never seen him be anything
but a perfect neighbor.

100
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,084
Oh, he's perfect now, is he?

101
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,170
Well, he's not perfect,
but he is very...

102
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,047
No, no, Marge,
don't backpedal!

103
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,799
You were right the first time.

104
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:03,011
He's perfect!
Perfect in every way.

105
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,221
I'm just gonna go take a walk
around the block to calm down.

106
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,681
I got a little excited.

107
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,224
I'm not perfect...

108
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,935
like Ned Flanders.

109
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,687
(concerned groan)

110
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,029
Neddy, you're tossing.

111
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,239
What's the matter?

112
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,575
I feel terrible.
Sometimes I forget

113
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,453
that we have things a little better
than the Simpsons.

114
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,164
I drag him over here,
he has a few beers.

115
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,291
You can't blame him
for erupting and then...

116
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,419
I turn into a snarling beast.

117
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,921
Talk about flunking the old
turn-the-other-cheek test.

118
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,134
Well, Ned, maybe I'm not the one
you should be talking to.

119
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,135
You're right.

120
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,431
Hello, Reverend Lovejoy?

121
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,560
(yawns)
No, this is Mrs. Lovejoy.

122
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,728
Just a minute.

123
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,147
Honey, honey, wake up.

124
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,067
It sounds like Ned Flanders
is having some sort of crisis.

125
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,861
Oh, probably stepped
on a worm.

126
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,488
(clears nose)

127
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,739
Hello, Ned.

128
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,491
Reverend, I'm sorry
to bother you at this hour,

129
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,786
but I threw a man
out of my house today.

130
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,789
I feel like I violated
Matthew 19:19.

131
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,124
-Huh?
-"Love thy neighbor."

132
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,586
Oh, oh.
Matthew 19:19, right, right.

133
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,798
Well, you know, Ned,
the good book says

134
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,966
"A gentle answer
turneth away wrath."

135
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,136
<i>A gentle answer?</i>
<i>Well, that is a jim-dandy idea.</i>

136
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,389
Bless you, Reverend.

137
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,893
"Dear neighbor..."

138
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,148
-HOMER: Flanders! 
-Ah!

139
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,026
I don't blame you for
being upset with me, Homer.

140
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,070
I just wanted to give you
this letter.

141
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,279
I'll leave now.

142
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,989
"Dear neighbor...

143
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,951
(laughing)

144
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,080
-"You are my brother."
-(laughing)

145
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:58,126
-"I love you.
-(laughing)

146
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:02,547
"And yet I feel
a great sadness

147
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,881
in my bosom."

148
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,843
(cackling)

149
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,219
Bosom.

150
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,012
Wait, wait, there's more.

151
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,140
I think that's terrible.

152
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,767
A man opens his heart,
and you make fun of him.

153
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,228
-(giggles)
-(laughter)

154
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,188
"Neighbors forever."
Oh, no.

155
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,731
(laughing)

156
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,733
-"Ned Flanders."
-(laughing)

157
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,944
What a sap.

158
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,321
Read the bosom part
again, Dad.

159
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,826
-Now just a minute!
-Bosom.

160
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,953
(laughing)

161
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,538
Bart!

162
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,374
I wish this family was
as close as the Flanders.

163
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,917
Okay, okay,
all right, all right.

164
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:40,960
She's right.

165
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,920
Let's do something together.

166
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,465
What does everyone say
to some miniature golf

167
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,801
followed by a round of frosty
chocolate milk shakes?

168
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,886
All right.

169
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,263
Hmm, I was going
to wash my hair.

170
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,348
And I'm studying
for the math fair.

171
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,976
If I win, I'll bring home
a brand new protractor.

172
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,269
Too bad we don't live
on a farm.

173
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,062
Let's go, boy.

174
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,527
Fore!

175
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,993
(laughing)

176
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,329
But I got it in the middle.

177
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,875
D'oh! That was just
a practice shot, boy.

178
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,752
Play it where it
lays, Homer.

179
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,727
Hey, there's Homer Simpson.

180
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,439
What a perfect opportunity
to follow up on my letter.

181
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,901
Aw, give up, homeboy.
There's a six-stroke limit.

182
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,445
I know, I know.
I can still make this for five.

183
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,740
Come on, baby, please,
please, go in, please.

184
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,288
D'oh!
(grunting)

185
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,791
Hi, Simpson.
Having fun?

186
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,793
Flanders,
what are you doing here?

187
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,295
Oh, just playing a little mini-golf
with the Todd-meister.

188
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,880
-Hi, Bart.
-Get bent.

189
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,507
Say, now that we're
all friends again,

190
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,883
why don't we
make a foursome?

191
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,426
-That sounds great.
-Well, okay.

192
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,594
All right.
This will be fun.

193
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,637
Oh, say, you looked like

194
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,638
you were having a little
trouble there.

195
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,098
Well, that shot is impossible!

196
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,308
Jack Nicholson himself
couldn't make it.

197
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,643
TODD: It is difficult,
Mr. Simpson.

198
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,396
The best strategy is
to play conservatively.

199
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,273
Hug the rail.
It won't go in

200
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,817
but you set yourself up
for an easy deuce.

201
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,321
Oh, well... hmm.
It went in.

202
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,407
-Good shot, Toddski.
-Luck.

203
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,450
BART:
Final score, Bart 41.

204
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,786
Homer, let's see...

205
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,163
Six plus six plus six
plus six plus six...

206
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,999
-Never mind.
-Hey, look.

207
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,168
TODD:
Wow! First prize, $50.

208
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,796
Wow! Free balloons
for everyone who enters.

209
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,840
So my little Bartly, thinking
of entering the tournament?

210
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,969
Yeah, he's entering and what's more,
he's going to win, aren't you, boy?

211
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,638
-I guess it's possible.
-Hey, I like that confidence.

212
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,599
But I hope you're not putting
too much pressure on the boy.

213
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,309
My Todd's awfully good.

214
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,270
Oh, yeah? Well, I think
the fruit of my loins

215
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,440
can beat the fruit of your loins
any day of the week.

216
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,108
-Come on, boy.
-Hyuh!

217
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,610
-(Homer slurps loudly)
-But Dad,

218
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,029
I've never won
anything in my life.

219
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,449
Son, this is the only time
I'm ever gonna say this.

220
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,992
It is not okay to lose.

221
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:26,459
Stay, stay. Good dog.

222
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,210
Now, keep your head down.

223
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,421
D'oh! Not you.
I'm talking to the boy.

224
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,965
Keep your head down.
Follow through.

225
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,136
Okay, that didn't work.

226
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,347
This time, move your head
and don't follow through.

227
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,765
Oh, man.

228
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,683
(concerned groaning)

229
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,561
What are you doing?

230
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,231
That putter is to you what a bat is
to a baseball player.

231
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,277
What a violin is to the...
the guy... the violin guy.

232
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,987
Now come on!
Give your putter a name.

233
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,572
What?

234
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,200
-Come on. Give it a name.
-Mr. Putter.

235
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,744
Oh! You want to try
a little harder, son?

236
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,664
-C'mon, give it a girl's name.
-Mom.

237
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,999
-Your putter's name is Charlene.
-Why?

238
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,668
It just is, that's why.

239
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,629
Now this is a picture
of your enemy

240
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,089
Todd Flanders.

241
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,966
Every day, I want you
to spend 15 minutes

242
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,010
staring at it
and concentrating

243
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,762
on how much you hate him,

244
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,139
and how glorious it will be

245
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,433
when you and Charlene
annihilate him.

246
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,769
-Who's Charlene?
-I'll show you who Charlene is.

247
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,187
Now start hating.

248
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:33,109
(growling)

249
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,110
Ugh.

250
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,405
Hi, Bart.

251
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:43,327
Homer, I couldn't help
overhearing you warp Bart's mind.

252
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,662
-And?
-Well, I'm worried

253
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,996
that you're making too big a deal

254
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,082
of this silly little
kiddie golf tournament.

255
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,419
But Marge, this is our big chance
to show up the Flanderses.

256
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,088
I'm sure it is,
but why do we want to do that?

257
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,007
Because sometimes the only way
you can feel good about yourself

258
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,093
is by making
someone else look bad.

259
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:02,263
And I'm tired of making other people
feel good about themselves.

260
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,597
Hmm.

261
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,021
-(groans)
-Hi, Bart. What are you doing?

262
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,983
Hey Lise, what do you call those guys
in chess that don't matter?

263
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,485
Well, a black-headed bishop
is of little value

264
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,904
but I think you're
referring to a pawn.

265
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,157
Right. I am a pawn.

266
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,160
Hmm, I know.
It's times like this that I'm thankful

267
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,580
Dad has little to no interest
in almost everything I do.

268
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,082
Bart, I think
I can help you.

269
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,084
LISA: Our journey begins here
at the library.

270
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,421
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hi, Mrs. Norton.

271
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,590
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hey, Ralph.

272
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,050
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hey, gang.

273
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,053
Okay, Bart, this is
the card catalogue.

274
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,764
Let's see. Golf.

275
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,975
Anecdotes, Eisenhower and...

276
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,478
profession, humor,
Japanese obsession with...

277
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,898
Ah, here it is.
Putting.

278
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,901
And finally, the most
important book of all--

279
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,903
The <i>Tao-Te Ching</i> by Lao-Tzu.

280
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,988
Lisa, we can't afford
all these books.

281
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,990
Bart, we're just
gonna borrow them.

282
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,784
Oh, heh heh! Gotcha.

283
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,370
LISA: I want you to shut off
the logical part of your mind.

284
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,872
BART: Okay.

285
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,707
-Embrace nothingness.
-You got it.

286
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,751
Become like
an uncarved stone.

287
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,294
-Done.
-Bart!

288
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,796
You're just pretending to
know what I'm talking about.

289
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,089
-True.
-Well, it's very frustrating.

290
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,674
I'll bet.

291
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,593
Bart, I have a riddle for you.

292
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,346
What's the sound
of one hand clapping?

293
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,181
Piece of cake.
(fingers slapping)

294
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,434
No, Bart, it's a 3, 000-year-old riddle
with no answer.

295
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,937
It supposed to clear your
mind of conscious thought.

296
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,439
No answer?
Lisa, listen up.

297
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,358
(fingers slapping)

298
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,443
Uh, let's try another one.

299
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,946
If a tree falls in the woods,
and no one's around,

300
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,280
does it make a sound?

301
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,992
Absolutely.
(makes crashing noises)

302
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,953
But Bart,
how can sound exist

303
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,247
if there's no one there
to hear it?

304
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,291
Whoo!

305
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,627
It is time.

306
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,922
The basis of this game seems
to be simple geometry.

307
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,924
All you have to do
is hit the ball here.

308
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,016
I can't believe it.

309
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,269
You've actually found
a practical use for geometry.

310
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,082
Bart, what are you doing?

311
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,417
Get down from there before
the neighbors see--

312
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,002
-Hey, Simpson.
-D'oh!

313
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,795
Flanders, I don't care
what this looks like.

314
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,424
Bart's gonna mop the floor
with your son's ugly butt.

315
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,718
Well, sir,
may the best man win.

316
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,720
Ah! "May the best man win."

317
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,263
The mating call of the loser.

318
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,723
Just a minute, Simpson.

319
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,766
I think my son has
a very good chance.

320
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,059
Oh, yeah? Want to bet?

321
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,312
Yeah, well,
I'm not a betting man.

322
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,730
(clucking sounds)

323
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,690
Oh, I'm a chicken, am I?

324
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,067
-That's right.
-All right, how's this for a wager?

325
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,237
A batch of your wife's
delicious blueberry muffins

326
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,990
against one of my wife's
homemade wind chimes.

327
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:11,160
Wha-- Are you afraid
to make a real bet?

328
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,622
-No, I just...
-(clucking)

329
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,416
You know, Simpson,
you're starting to annoy me.

330
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,918
How about this, henny penny?

331
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,713
If Bart wins tomorrow,
you have to mow my lawn.

332
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:26,467
All right, and if Todd wins,
you have to mow my lawn.

333
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,261
-Aah!
-And do a decent job of it for a change!

334
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,181
Better yet, you have
to mow my lawn

335
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,350
in your wife's Sunday dress!

336
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:38,687
You have yourself a bet,
you... jackaninny!

337
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,774
Read that back to me, Marge.

338
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,734
"The father of the loser
mows the lawn..."

339
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,946
Hey, hey. Just a minute.
Loser is such a harsh word.

340
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,156
Couldn't we say,
"the boy who doesn't win"?

341
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,116
Oh, man. Fine.

342
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,244
"The father of the boy
who doesn't win

343
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,872
has to mow the lawn
in his wife's Sunday dress."

344
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,873
There you go.

345
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,458
Now, I suppose
you both have to sign this.

346
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,710
I hope blood
won't be necessary.

347
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,672
I'm game
if you are, Flanders.

348
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,091
(sighs)

349
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,843
Good gravy,
what have I done?

350
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,720
Keep your
left arm straight, Bart.

351
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,973
-Rotate your shoulders.
-TOGETHER: Dad!

352
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,393
Look, son. All I'm asking
is that you try.

353
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,769
Okay, I'll try.

354
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,437
Anybody can try!

355
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,814
I want you to win!

356
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,650
(screams)

357
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,783
Homer?

358
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,160
Marge?
Give me your honest opinion.

359
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,871
-This or this?
-(groans)

360
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,138
-Aah!
-Good morning, son.

361
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,640
Oh, by the way, today's
the day of the big tournament.

362
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,475
-And you'd better win!
-Dad!

363
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,602
See you downstairs, boy.

364
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,276
Heh, heh, heh.
That crazy Marmaduke.

365
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,195
-Eighth hole.
-Aim for the octopus, third tentacle.

366
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,072
-12th hole.
-Bank it off the pink tombstone.

367
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,866
-Nirvana.
-A state of bliss attained through

368
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,867
the extinction of the self.

369
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,243
MARGE: Here you go, Bart.

370
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:19,079
A lumberjack's breakfast
for my little golfer.

371
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,666
Mom, Bart is on a strict diet
of complex carbohydrates.

372
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,418
Steak will make him logy.

373
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,795
Well, what won't make
him logy?

374
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,505
-Oatmeal.
-Oatmeal?

375
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,549
Oats are what
a champion thoroughbred eats

376
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,177
before he or she wins
the Kentucky Derby.

377
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,928
News flash, Lisa.

378
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,680
Bart is not a horse.

379
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,931
Eat your steak, boy.

380
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,404
ANNOUNCER (British accent):
<i>Good afternoon, everybody,</i>

381
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,782
<i>and welcome to the finale</i>
<i>of what has already been</i>

382
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,992
<i>a stirring afternoon</i>
<i>of miniature golf.</i>

383
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,037
<i>The cream has risen.</i>
<i>The wheat has bid farewell to the chaff.</i>

384
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,916
And now we approach the championship
match with but two warriors remaining:

385
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,959
the heretofore unknown
Bart Simpson

386
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,878
and Todd Flanders,

387
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,839
one of the most skilled ten-year-olds
to ever take back the blade.

388
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,009
Bart, having never received any words
of encouragement myself,

389
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,971
I'm not sure how they're supposed
to sound, but here goes.

390
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,432
-I believe in you.
-Thanks, man.

391
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,059
NED: Oh Lord,
we beseech thee...

392
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,602
Hey Flanders,
it's no use praying.

393
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,646
I already did
the same thing

394
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,648
and we can't both win.

395
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,651
Actually Simp-son, we were
praying that no one gets hurt.

396
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,570
Oh, well, Flan-ders,
it doesn't matter.

397
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,864
This time tomorrow
you'll be wearing high heels.

398
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,033
-No, you will. Afraid so.
-Afraid not. Afraid not.

399
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,284
-Afraid so.
-Afraid not, infinity.

400
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,953
-Afraid so, infinity plus one.
-D'oh!

401
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,997
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Young Flanders has the honor</i>

402
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,833
<i>and will tee off first.</i>

403
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,422
<i>It's got a chance.</i>

404
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,507
-(ball clanking)
<i>-Yes, sir!</i>

405
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,592
Oh, man.

406
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,511
(exhaling) Tree falling in the woods.
Tree falling in the woods.

407
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,680
Tree falling in...

408
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,186
-(ball clanking)
-(crowd murmurs)

409
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,105
ANNOUNCER: <i>And the battle</i>
<i>is well and truly joined.</i>

410
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,106
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

411
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,024
Mercy is for the weak, Todd!

412
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,364
Yeah!

413
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:21,952
Yee-hee!

414
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,543
Yeah!

415
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,421
Eee, eee...

416
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,425
D'oh!

417
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,928
ANNOUNCER:
<i>If one were to look up "courage"</i>

418
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,388
<i>in the Oxford English</i>
<i>dictionary,</i>

419
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,056
<i>one might very well</i>
<i>come upon a photo</i>

420
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,558
<i>of these two gladiators.</i>

421
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,851
They approach the final hole
in the shadow of

422
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,561
The Great Emancipator

423
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,563
deadlocked at eight strokes
on the happy side of par.

424
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,481
Soon, one man will
emerge triumphant.

425
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,442
He will drink naught
but champagne

426
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,361
while his opponent tastes bitter defeat,
in this oft-cruel game.

427
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,159
(crowd oohs)

428
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,496
It's okay, son.
You can recover.

429
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,956
Come on, Bart.

430
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,458
Remember what
Vince Lombardi said--

431
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,793
"If you lose,
you're out of the family."

432
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,420
-Homer! (smack)
-Ow!

433
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,842
-(gasps)
-(gasps)

434
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,302
(gasping)

435
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,099
-Whew!
-Whew!

436
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,684
Neither man showing
his best form.

437
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,019
This sort of pressure
can unhinge

438
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,604
even the steeliest
of competitors.

439
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,066
This is pretty tense,
isn't it, Todd?

440
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,984
Yeah. My knees
are shaking

441
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,945
I got butterflies
in my stomach,

442
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,572
but I guess this
builds character.

443
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,241
Who wants to build character?

444
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,160
-Let's quit.
-Okay.

445
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,162
We decided
we're equally good.

446
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,122
We wanna call it a draw, man.

447
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,166
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

448
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,837
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a draw.

449
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,130
(crowd murmurs)

450
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,882
Forgive an old Brit
for crying,

451
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,968
but this is
the most stirring display

452
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,303
of gallantry and sportsmanship

453
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,598
since Mountbatten gave Egypt
back to the Punjabis.

454
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,100
Put her there, man.

455
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,351
Yeah, all right.

456
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,106
Well, Homer

457
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,941
our kids showed us
something today, huh?

458
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,402
By working together,
we can both be winners.

459
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,238
(chuckles) Thank heaven,
neither of us has to go through

460
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,781
with that silly wager.
Put her there, pal.

461
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,784
Oh, so you're going
to welch on our bet?

462
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,161
What are you talking about?
Neither boy lost.

463
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,997
I got it in right here
in writing.

464
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,666
"The father of the boy
who doesn't win

465
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,210
has to mow the lawn
in his wife's Sunday dress."

466
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,004
Yeah, but neith--
I mean we're both--

467
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,755
I mean,
you have to do it too.

468
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,633
It's a small price to pay
to see you humiliate yourself.

469
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,845
( whistles, jeers and laughter)

470
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,725
Hmm, my best dress.

471
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,601
Why do I get the feeling
that someday

472
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,312
I'll be describing this
to a psychiatrist?

473
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:57,607
Listen to them laughing.
This is so humiliating.

474
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,984
I'm never gonna
live this down.

475
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,069
Damn Flanders.

476
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,238
You know, Simpson,
I feel kind of silly,

477
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,073
but what the hay, you know?

478
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,367
Kinda reminds me of my
good ol' fraternity days.

479
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:11,038
D'oh! Oh, my God!
He's enjoying it.
