00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,314
filled with man-eating
great white sharks,

175
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,275
deadly electric eels,

176
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,278
ravenous piranhas,
bone-crushing alligators,

177
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,446
and perhaps the most
frightening of all,

178
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,243
the king of the jungle,
one ferocious lion!

179
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,244
-Ohh!
-Ohh!

180
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,913
Oh, and...
(laughing)

181
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,207
I almost forgot.

182
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:48,629
To add a real element of danger,
one drop of human blood.

183
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,885
And on chance I don't survive,
let me just say:

184
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,014
seat belts save lives,
so buckle up.

185
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,520
This is so cool.

186
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,111
Oh, I can't watch!

187
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,328
-(tires screech)
-He made it!

188
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,998
(cheering)

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,251
(gasping)

190
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,590
Bitchin'!

191
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,428
ANNOUNCER:
<i>He's okay, folks.</i>

192
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,306
(cheering)

193
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,726
(muffler rattles)

194
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,441
What a fun-filled evening.

195
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,570
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

196
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,864
<i>the ten-year-old</i>
<i>who's brave and bold.</i>

197
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,700
<i>When he's not in class,</i>
<i>he's risking his ass.</i>

198
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,746
<i>The world's greatest daredevil,</i>
<i>Bart Simpson!</i>

199
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,498
(chanting)
Bart! Bart! Bart!

200
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,749
Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart!

201
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,377
Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart!

202
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,712
Bart, Bart.

203
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,130
-We're home, son.
-Huh?

204
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,927
Dad, I want to be a daredevil.

205
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,221
(chuckles)
Kids say such stupid things.

206
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,727
You're crazy, Bart.

207
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,312
You're never gonna make it.

208
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,772
Spare me your lectures, ladies.

209
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,738
-Ahh!
-(gasping)

210
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,407
Oh, no, he's hurt.

211
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,492
-Bad.
-Let's get out of here.

212
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,338
Oh, my little boy.
(kissing)

213
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,882
Come on Marge,
we're mad at him.

214
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,051
-Are you all right?
-Better than all right.

215
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,387
-I got stitches.
-TOGETHER: Eww.

216
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,264
Probably a scar too.

217
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,183
Mrs. Simpson, Bart tells me
he injured himself

218
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,644
training for a career
in death defiance?

219
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,605
Yes, well we saw
a daredevil last night,

220
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,733
and, well, you know,
monkey see, monkey do.

221
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:17,361
Hmm. I think I know something
that might discourage him

222
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,738
from this sort of behavior.

223
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,656
Bart, in this ward
are the children

224
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,783
who have been hurt
by imitating stunts

225
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,870
they saw on television,
movies and the legitimate stage.

226
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:32,752
This little boy broke his leg
trying to fly like Superman.

227
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,796
This boy's brother

228
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,298
hit him in the head
with a wrench,

229
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,633
mimicking a recent
TV wrestling match.

230
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:43,846
I won't even subject you to the horrors
of our Three Stooges ward.

231
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,349
Gee, I never realized TV was
such a dangerous influence.

232
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,643
Well, as tragic
as all this is,

233
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,979
it's a small price to pay
for countless hours

234
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,522
of top-notch entertainment.

235
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,065
Amen, huh, Bart?

236
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,984
Has Dr. Hibbert
made his point?

237
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,319
He certainly has, Dad.

238
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,613
I learned a real
lesson here today.

239
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,823
-Thank you, Dr. Hibbert.
-Mmm.

240
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,750
(grunts)

241
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,834
I did it.

242
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,044
-Wow!
-All right!

243
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,715
-(cheering)
-BOY: Cool! Way happening, Bart!

244
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,010
-Awesome!
-Aw, man, you're the king.

245
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,595
-That was so cool.
-Thank you.

246
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,931
How about a hand for
these brave little animals.

247
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,933
(cheering)

248
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,142
(snoring)

249
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,477
(cheering)

250
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,479
Huh? Huh? Oh...

251
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,439
Hi, kids. Thanks.

252
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,360
Okay, field trippers,
off the bus.

253
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,278
What's the matter, Bart?

254
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,322
Aw, I'm runnin' on empty,
Milhouse.

255
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,199
You kids get a kick
out of my jumps

256
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:49,203
and I love you for it,
but it's all too easy.

257
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,373
There has got to be a challenge
out there worthy of me.

258
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:56,043
Hello, children, and welcome
to Springfield Gorge.

259
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,503
BART: Wow!

260
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,547
Man, this thing's pretty gnarly.

261
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,841
I bet you could throw
a dead body in there

262
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,551
and no one would ever find it.

263
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,761
Otto, I'm going to leap over
Springfield Gorge

264
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,972
on my skateboard.

265
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,558
You know, Bart,
as the only adult here,

266
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,184
I feel I should say something.

267
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,770
-What?
-Cool!

268
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,981
-(wind blows)
-(birds chirping)

269
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,823
♪♪ (Otto hums "Purple Haze")

270
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,784
Hey, Otto, can I use
that microphone?

271
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,662
<i>♪ Do-do-do da-do-do-do... ♪</i>

272
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,748
Sorry, Bart dude,
it's for emergencies only.

273
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,125
<i>♪ Do-do-do da-do-do-do... ♪</i>

274
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,793
But I want to tell them
about my jump.

275
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,169
Oh. Okay.

276
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,380
May I have your attention,
please?

277
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,966
This Saturday, I'll be jumping
over Springfield Gorge

278
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,175
on my skateboard.

279
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,760
There is a good possibility

280
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,596
I will plunge
to my bloody death.

281
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,347
Hope to see you there.
Thank you.

282
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:54,643
Springfield Gorge?
Bart, you'll be killed.

283
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,229
Lisa, I don't know how
to explain this, but I get

284
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,481
the same thrill out of
jumping over stuff

285
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,484
that you do from... reading.

286
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,903
Please, before you do anything

287
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,697
there's someone
I'd like you to talk to.

288
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,533
Thank you for arranging this,
Dr. Hibbert.

289
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:13,287
Oh, anything I can do to stem the tide
of entertainment-related injury.

290
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,456
Now children,
you're about to meet

291
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,917
the world's greatest daredevil,
Lance Murdock.

292
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,920
-Lance, this is Lisa and Bart Simpson.
-(groans)

293
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,088
Bart is one
of your biggest fans.

294
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,507
It's an honor, Lance.
How you feeling?

295
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,427
-Uh, I-- Ow.
-(bone snaps)

296
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,804
Doc, I heard a snap.

297
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,057
Mmm. I'm afraid
the bone's broken.

298
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,475
Well, that's all of them.

299
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,185
-(gasps)
-Don't worry, partner.

300
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,020
I've broken that thumb
dozens of times.

301
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,481
Hey! I bet you'd like
an autograph. Nurse?

302
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,441
Who should I make this out to?

303
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,318
Just Bart will be fine, sir.

304
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:48,197
"To Bart.
Thanks for visiting me

305
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:53,452
"at Springfield
General Hospital.

306
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:58,332
"Your visit was
a ray of sunshine

307
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,586
"on an otherwise cloudy day.

308
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,799
Your pal,
Captain Lance Murdock."

309
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,092
Wow, man.

310
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,345
-Thanks, Lance.
-You're welcome.

311
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,138
Take this thing
out of my mouth now.

312
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,807
Mr. Murdoch, my brother
is thinking about

313
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,267
jumping Springfield Gorge
on a skateboard.

314
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:21,188
Could you leave me with
the young'uns, please?

315
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,400
Now, let me start by saying
good for you, son.

316
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,277
It's always good to see young people
taking an interest in danger.

317
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,030
Now, a lot of people are gonna
be tellin' you you're crazy,

318
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,658
and maybe they're right,
but the fact of the matter is

319
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,077
bones heal,
chicks dig scars,

320
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,121
and the United States
of America

321
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,624
has the best doctor-to-daredevil
ratio in the world.

322
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,793
-But Captain Murdock!
-Thanks, Lance!

323
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,628
You're welcome,
little partner.

324
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,755
On your way out, tell the nurse
I'm ready for my sponge bath.

325
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,466
Another fringe benefit.
Nurse?

326
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,926
HOMER:
<i>Springfield Gorge?</i>

327
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,929
I thought we settled
this daredevil junk.

328
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,764
-Squealer.
-I'm sorry Bart,

329
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,850
but if you got hurt
or died,

330
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,811
despite the extra attention
I'd receive, I'd miss you.

331
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,272
Bart, I forbid you to jump
over that gorge.

332
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,149
-You can't.
-I can and do!

333
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,735
Go to your room, Bart!
There, I've done it.

334
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,737
I'm glad somebody
finally stepped in

335
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,072
and put an end to this nonsense
once and for all.

336
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,074
Hey man, you can tell me
not to do it,

337
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,744
but there's no way you can
watch me 24 hours a day.

338
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,662
And the minute
your back is turned,

339
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,498
I'm grabbing my skateboard
and heading for that gorge.

340
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:25,377
He's got us, Marge.
There's nothing we can do.

341
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,921
He's as good as dead.
(weeps)

342
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,258
You're his father. You've got to
try and reason with him.

343
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,927
No, that never works.
He's a goner.

344
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:38,098
Come on, Homer. A heart-to-heart talk
with your son.

345
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,600
You've got to try.

346
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,311
Okay, okay. I'll try.

347
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,773
Bart? Bart?

348
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,025
-Bart! What are you doing?
-Nothing.

349
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,611
You were on your way to jump
the gorge, weren't you?

350
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:54,281
-Maybe.
-Look, I know I can't stop you.

351
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,533
The only thing I can do

352
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,869
is ask you to promise me
you won't jump the gorge.

353
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,704
-Okay. I promise.
-D'oh!

354
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,624
-What's the matter?
-You didn't mean that.

355
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,210
Bart, this isn't one of
those phony baloney promises

356
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,753
I don't expect you
to keep.

357
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,589
If you make this promise,
you have to keep it.

358
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,382
-Why?
-Because if you don't,

359
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,218
I'll never believe
anything you say

360
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,637
-ever again.
-Oh, come on.

361
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,225
-I mean it, boy.
-Well, okay, Dad. I promise.

362
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,560
I will not jump
Springfield Gorge.

363
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,771
That's my boy.

364
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,773
How'd it go, Homer?

365
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,400
You know, Marge,
we got a pretty good kid there.

366
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,944
Well, he's got
a pretty good father.

367
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,530
(chuckles)

368
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,701
Where is he?

369
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,036
I thought he said noon.

370
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,414
Aw, he's just doing this
to build the suspense.

371
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,917
-Whoa, what a showman.
-Look! There he is.

372
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,387
Hey, boy, want to toss
the old...

373
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,890
D'oh! Why, that little liar!
I shoulda--

374
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,685
I was going
to play pickle with him.

375
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:09,648
(crowd oohing and aahing)

376
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,123
(vehicle approaching)

377
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,249
(tires screeching)

378
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,834
Bart!

379
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,257
(both grunting)

380
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,217
-Boo!
-Boo!

381
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,261
Hey, what gives?

382
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,847
Boy, I tried ordering you.
I tried punishing you,

383
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,683
and God help me,
I even tried reasoning with you,

384
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,811
and the only thing left for me to do
is jump the gorge myself.

385
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:48,812
What? Why?

386
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,856
Because that way,
you'll see what it's like

387
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:55,319
to witness a family member stupidly
risking his life for no good reason.

388
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,946
But Dad, you'll never make it.

389
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,115
Don't you think
I know that?

390
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,205
-Good-bye, son.
-Wait, Dad! Don't do it!

391
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,457
I won't jump anymore,
I promise.

392
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,502
Oh, thank God, thank God,
thank God.

393
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,922
-I love you, Dad.
-I love you, too, son.

394
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,007
You know, boy,
I don't think

395
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,550
I've ever felt
as close to you

396
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,302
as I do right--

397
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,096
Huh? What? (shouting)

398
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,475
(screaming)

399
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,143
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

400
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,854
I'm going to make it!
I'm going to make it!

401
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,648
This is the greatest thrill
of my life.

402
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,066
I'm king of the world.

403
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,818
Woo hoo! Woo hoo! I--

404
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,153
(screaming)

405
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,697
Ooh! Ow! Ooh! Oh!
