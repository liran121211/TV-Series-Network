Come on, Homer.
We're dying of curiosity.

Look, there's only one thing

It's being one of those guys

-Well, last year

Marge, this ticket
doesn't just give me a seat.

47
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:48,626
It also gives me the right--
no, the duty--

-What's the matter, boy?
-He wouldn't sign my ball.

345
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,615
if we had gotten to know
each other better,

346
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,617
my leaving would actually
have meant something.

347
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,285
-Yeah.
-Yeah, right.

348
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,289
Well, we have
one quick stop

349
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,583
and then it's on
to Capital City.

350
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,293
I can't believe it--

351
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,003
our baby sister
in the big city.

352
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,756
-I'll call you every day.
-I'll call you, too.

353
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,757
(horn honking)

354
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,884
Look, he can
use a horn.

355
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,886
-(engine starts)
-(horn honking)

356
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,471
Oh, shut up.

357
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,513
(cheering, applause)

358
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,516
HOMER: <i>Some may say</i>

359
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,603

<i>a bad break in life--</i>

360
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,897
<i>little education,</i>

361
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,066
<i>bald as a cue ball,</i>

362

<i>ten years on the same job</i>
<i>for the same salary.</i>

363
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:51,075
<i>But today, as I leave</i>

364
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,327
<i>I consider myself</i>

365
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,289

369
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,302

Sorry, honey.

408
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,709
I'm just a little nervous.

409
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,588
HOMER: <i>We would</i>

<i>For the first time</i>

412
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,138
Okay, here are
your tickets.

413
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,723
They are supposed to be good.

414
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,850
You're sitting
with the players' wives.

415
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,519
And don't forget
to cheer for me.

416
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,438
See you after the game
when you're a big star.

417

<i>Bart was strangely quiet.</i>

418

00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,569
<i>by feelings</i>

420
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,529
<i>It wouldn't last.</i>

421
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,488
Wow.

422
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,994
(gasp) Oh, my God!
I don't believe it.

423
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,496
It's really you--

424
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,289
The Capital City Goofball.

425
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,917
Hello, Dancin' Homer.
Glad to have you aboard.

426
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,669
If there's anything
I can do for you--

427
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,754
-just squeeze the wheeze.
-(honks)

428
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,133
The fifth inning
will be yours.

429
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,509
Everyone is
settled in.

430
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,219
They've had
a couple of beers.

431
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,680
The game is official.
It's a pretty important inning.

432
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,931
Wow, the fifth.

433
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,850
It's also the inning
I wish I had a zipper

434
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,352
on the front of this thing,
if you know what I mean.

435
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,311
-(honking)
-Right, Mr. Goofball.

436
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,105
Hey, call me
plain old "Goof."

437
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,190
So, what exactly do you
have planned for us?

438
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,441
Well, I get up, I dance,

439
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,068
I spell out the name
of the city

440
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,987
all to the tune of
"Baby Elephant Walk."

441
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,656
Ah, Mancini,
the mascot's best friend.

442
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,241
Well, see you
on that field.

443
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,286
I'll set 'em up.
You knock 'em down.

444
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,455
(thud)

445
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,166
-♪♪ (organ)
<i>-Well, hello again everybody.</i>

446
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,667
Dave Glass talking at you.

447
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,753
We got great weather
here tonight under the dome.

448
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,714
Hmm, let's see.

449
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:37,676
Upper, upper,
upper mezzanine. Hmm.

450
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,554
Well, these must be ours.

451
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,848
-These seats stink!
-You'd think players' wives

452
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,641
would be a little closer
to the action.

453
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,603
Actually, this section is for
the players' ex-wives.

454
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,521
And then I found out
that all the while,

455
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,940
there was this bimbo
in Kansas City.

456
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,233
Throw at his head!

457
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,695
HOMER:
<i>Who'd have thought it?</i>

458
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,989
<i>A free ticket to</i>
<i>a big league park,</i>

459
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,866
<i>but I was too tense</i>
<i>to enjoy the game.</i>

460
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,910
<i>Every ounce of concentration</i>
<i>I possessed</i>

461
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,203
<i>was focused on</i>
<i>the task at hand.</i>

462
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,039
Red Hots!
Get your Red Hots here!

463
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,498
<i>Ooh, Red Hots.</i>

464
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,042
ANNOUNCER:

<i>Dancin' Homer!</i>

467
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,633
Mmm, these do taste better
at the ball park.

468
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,926
Uh-oh.

469
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,095
There he is!

470
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,390
<i>I was graceful.</i>
<i>I was witty.</i>

471
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,559
<i>Brother, I was something.</i>

472
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,394
<i>But they didn't care.</i>

473
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,563
(yawning)

474
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,232
What is with
these people?

475
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,608
Why are they sitting
on their hands?

476
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,859
Mom, what's he doing wrong?

477
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,778
I don't know.

478
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,655
HOMER:
<i>It was so quiet,</i>

479
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,281
<i>you could hear each individual</i>
<i>smart-ass remark.</i>

480
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,575
Well, this guy doesn't
make me want to cheer.

481
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,244
Gee, I really pity him,

482
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,204
making a fool of himself
in front of so many people.

483
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,122
These cornball antics
may play in the sticks,

484
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,041
but this is Capital City.

485
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,751
<i>The only applause I got</i>

486
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,378
<i>was for dragging my carcass</i>
<i>out of there.</i>

487
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,881
Hey, Mr. Showmanship.

488
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,300
The owner wants to see you
in his office right now.

489
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,427
I'm sorry, young man,
you're just not ready.

490
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,887
Pick up your check
at the front office,

491
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,764
and for God's sake,
put some clothes on!

492
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,183
Well, I guess it's back
to good old Springfield.

493
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,519
But I can't go back!
Not after I've seen

494
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,104
the bright lights
of Capital City.

495
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,398
I'll wither and die
like a hothouse flower.

496
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,817
Now stop it, you two,
and don't look too down.

497
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,069
I'm sure this is hard enough
for your father.

498
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,405
(cheering)

499
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,823
Way to go, man!
All right, Dad!

500
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,157
Oh, what a family.

501
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,493
<i>My wife and kids</i>
<i>stood by me.</i>

502
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,786
<i>On the way home,</i>

503
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,579
<i>I realized</i>
<i>how little that helped.</i>

504
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:33,458
So that's it.
The costume's buried now.

505
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:37,754
As my son would say,
I'm one sad ape-like dude.

506
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,506
-Wow!
-What a saga.

507
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:43,051
Hey. You guys are hanging
on my every word.

508
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,928
I've become
the center of attention.

509
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,305
Yeah, it's riveting.

510
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,472
Tell it again, Homer.

511
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,599
Okay.

512
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,144
I wonder why stories of
degradation and humiliation

513
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,478
make you more popular.

514
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,398
MOE:
I don't know. They just do.
