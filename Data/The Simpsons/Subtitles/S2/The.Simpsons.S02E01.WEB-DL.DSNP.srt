you were Hemingway.

00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,079

-Bart Simpson? 
-Oh!

33
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,333
Is your book report on
"Treasure Island" ready?

34
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,419
Is it ready?
Ha! What a question.

35
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,047
Fellow students,
prepare to be dazzled.

36
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,883
Well, as Mrs. Krabappel
already mentioned

37
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,011
the name of the book that
I read was "Treasure Island."

38
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,389
It's about these... pirates.

39
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,809
Pirates with patches
over their eyes...

40
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,435
and shiny gold teeth...

41
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,397
and green birds
on their shoulders.

42
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,567
Did I mention this book

43
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,570
was written by a guy named
Robert Louis Stevenson?

44
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,322
And published by the good
people at McGraw-Hill.

45
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,074
So, in conclusion

46
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,076
on the Simpson scale
of one to ten

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,828
ten being the highest,
one being the lowest

48
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:46,583
and five being average,
I give this book a nine.

49
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,376
Ahem. Any questions?

50
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,420
No? Then I'll just sit down.

51
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,172
Bart, did you read the book?

52
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,299
Mrs. Krabappel,
I am insulted.

53
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,593
Is this a book report
or a witch hunt?

54
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,847
Then perhaps you'd like to tell us
the name of the pirate.

-Yes, ma'am.

-Uh...

and fly right?

00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,547

leave England?

(whistling)

179
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,008
(groaning)

180
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,926
What's the matter, son?

181
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,221
Sharp, stabbing pains
in my stomach.

182
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,682
Oh, dear.
I've heard of this.

183
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,684
Do you feel a shooting pain
in your arm?

184
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,394
-Both arms, ma'am.
-Mm-hmm.

185
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,937
Temporary loss of vision?

186
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,357
Who said that?
Come closer.

187
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,069
-(bell ringing)
-Yes, dear?

188
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,615
Ahh. Maybe, um,
one more dish.

189
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,408
Make it double cappuccino
chocolate fudge.

190
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,410
Ooh, your third bowl.

191
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,870
I think you may be
on the mend.

192
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,497
Is there anything else
I can get you?

193
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,623
Hmm...

194
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,541
Perhaps the TV?

195
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,335
Of course. Homer!

196
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,795
-What?
-Bring the television up.

197
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,548
-Bart's got his vision back.
-D'oh!

198
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,427
(straining) I wish I had
<i>amoria phlebitis.</i>

199
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,304
Everyone knows
you're faking it, Bart.

200
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,681
Well, everyone better
keep their mouth shut.

201
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,850
You're gonna have to fail that
history test sooner or later.

202
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,978
-I've got my bases covered.
-(phone line ringing)

203
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,356
Hey, Milhouse, what'd
I miss in school today?

204
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,275
Nothin' much. Lewis made Richard laugh
milk through his nose.

205
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,528
Oh, you don't say. What about
that history test, huh?

206
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,071
Piece of cake, huh?

207
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,865
Listen, what did you get
for number one?

208
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,742
Uh-huh.
Number two?

209
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,161
Oh, yeah, that sounds right.

210
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,454
Mm, mm-mm, mm, mm, mmm.

211
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,039
Ahh!

212
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,541
Here you go,
Mrs. Krabappel.

213
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,544
I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.

214
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,839
Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm.

215
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,551
This test is worse
than Milhouse's exam.

216
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,469
Bart Simpson, I warned you.

217
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,555
This is the final straw.

218
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,141
Mr. And Mrs. Simpson, I think you know
our district psychiatrist

219
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,894
-Dr. J. Loren Pryor.
-Hey, Doctor J.

220
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,064
Hmph. I think what we have
on our hands here is a classic case

221
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,901
of what laymen refer to
as "fear of failure."

222
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,487
As a result,
Bart is an underachiever,

223
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,449
and yet he seems to be--
how should I put this--

224
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,035
-proud of it.
-Hmm.

225
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,745
One of his problems may be
his short attention span

226
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,414
which can lead to...

227
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,708
blah blah blah
blah blah blah...

228
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,626
-Uh-huh.
-Blah blah

229
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,087
-blah blah blah blah...
-Hmm...

230
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,507
Bart has failed his last
four exams in History.

231
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,634
Is there anything
you're not telling us?

232
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,719
No.

233
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,970
Every other student
in the class has shown

234
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,222
at least some form
of improvement,

235
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,390
and yet you
continue to struggle.

236
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,434
-Why is that?
-I don't know.

237
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,060
Look at these results--

238
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,396
Fifty-five,
Forty-two,

239
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,648
Twenty-six--
A 12 on state capitals?

240
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,235
Okay! Okay. Why are we dancing
around the obvious?

241
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,946
I know it. You know it.
I am dumb, okay? Dumb as a post!

242
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,406
You think I'm
happy about it?

243
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,950
There, there, Bart,
you're just a late bloomer.

244
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,910
Oh, I wish it were
that simple.

245
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,455
As shameful and as emotionally
crippling as it may be,

246
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,791
I'm afraid my recommendation
is for Bart Simpson to...

247
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,627
repeat the fourth grade.

248
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,713
What? You can't hold me back.
I'll do better. I promise.

249
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,131
-Promises, promises.
-Oh, sure. That'll be the day.

250
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,050
Well, maybe it
would help him

251
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,801
to be left back.

252
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,762
It won't be
so bad, Bart.

253
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,555
No, I mean it.
You can't hold me back.

254
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,349
I swear I'm gonna do better.

255
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,100
Look at my eyes.
See the sincerity?

256
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,227
See the conviction?
See the fear?

257
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,065
As God is my witness,
I can pass the fourth grade!

258
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,401
And if you don't, at least you'll
be bigger than the other kids.

259
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,819
(concerned groan)

260
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,617
Get off the bus, or forever
hold your peace, little dudes.

261
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,662
Otto, you know
I respect you.

262
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,497
I mean, you always
let us throw stuff at cars

263
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,582
and try to tip the bus
on sharp turns.

264
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,877
Damn thing never goes over,
does it?

265
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,253
So what's in your head,
little man?

266
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,757
Well, I been failing
a lot of tests recently.

267
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,676
-Yuh-huh?
-And now they're talking about

268
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,012
holding me back in the 4th grade
if I don't shape up.

269
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,640
That's it?
Hey, relax, man.

270
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,017
It could end up being the best thing
that ever happened to you.

271
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,311
I got held back in
the fourth grade myself.

272
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,271
Twice.

273
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,150
And look at me, man.
Now I drive the school bus.

274
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,863
DR. PRYOR:
<i>I'm afraid my recommendation</i>

275
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,533
<i>is for Bart Simpson to</i>
<i>repeat the fourth grade...</i>

276
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:44,078
(echoing) <i>repeat the fourth grade...</i>
<i>repeat the fourth grade...</i>

277
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,707
All right, class.
The topic is world literature.

278
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,752
What was the pirate's name
in "Treasure Island"?

279
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,629
Bart Simpson?

280
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,048
Look, lady,
I got a peptic ulcer,

281
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,677
a wife hawking me for a new car,
and I need a root canal.

282
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,012
Will you quit bugging me
about this stupid pirate?

283
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,140
Psst.
It's Long John Silver, Dad.

284
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,933
I heard that, Bart, Jr.

285
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,019
I want to see both of you
after class today.

286
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,690
D'oh!
Thanks a lot, son.

287
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,567
(infield chatter)

288
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,903
Yo, little help.

289
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,780
I said, "little help."

290
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,782
Throw me the ball,
Poindexter!

291
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,784
Oh, I'm sorry, Bart.

292
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,495
I'm unfamiliar with
the rules of your sport.

293
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,498
I didn't want to interfere
with a ball in play.

294
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,168
(laughing)

295
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,504
Well, back to the forecastle
of the Pequod.

296
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,882
-Hmm... hey, Martin?
-You have your ball.

297
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,342
I have nothing else
of value.

298
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,511
I need you to help me
get a passing grade.

299
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,307
Well, you do need someone's
help to get a passing grade,

300
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,726
but I don't know why
that someone should be me.

301
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,810
Because I can make it
so the other kids

302
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,520
don't laugh at you so much.

303
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,982
They... laugh at me?

304
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,569
I'd always considered myself
rather popular.

305
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,155
You're not.
Watch. Hnh!

306
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,157
(laughing)

307
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,743
But my speed with numbers,

308
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,913
my years of service
as a hall monitor,

309
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,707
my prizewinning
dioramas--

310
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,834
these things
mean nothing to them?

311
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,711
Perhaps another
demonstration. Hnh!

312
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,880
(kids laughing)

313
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,549
Very well. You have made
your point, Bart.

314
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,967
Then it's a deal?

315
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,552
Yes.

316
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,639
Alrighty, let's have a look-see
at your study area.

317
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,307
-Study area?
-Yes,

318
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,185
your sanctuary from
the hurly-burly of modern life.

319
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,313
Well, there's a desk
under that junk over there.

320
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,483
MARTIN: Oh, no, no, no, no.
This won't do at all.

321
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,193
We're gonna have to
clean up this room,

322
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,362
and we'll clearly need
a few ferns in here.

323
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,948
No study area is complete
without adequate plant life.

324
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,952
-No.
-No?

325
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,578
Only geeks
sit in the front seat.

326
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,413
From now on,
sit in the back row.

327
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,457
And that's not just
on the bus.

328
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,793
-It goes for school and church, too.
-Why?

329
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,254
So no one can see
what you're doing.

330
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,048
Oh! I think I understand.

331
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,467
The potential for mischief
varies inversely

332
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,803
with one's proximity
to the authority figure.

333
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,597
Well, yeah, but don't
say it like that.

334
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,308
(tires skidding)

335
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,854
-(crashing)
-MARTIN: Ooh!

336
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,208
Nnymm.

337
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,003
Nyahh!

338
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,004
Uhhnng!

339
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,046
-Aaah!
-Aaah!

340
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,344
Huh!

341
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,598
Pretty soon you will be ready
to try it with a real book.

342
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,601
(laughing)

343
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,019
Who would have thought

344
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,937
that pushing a boy into
the girls' lavatory

345
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,439
could be such a thrill?

346
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,816
The screams,
the humiliation,

347
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,860
