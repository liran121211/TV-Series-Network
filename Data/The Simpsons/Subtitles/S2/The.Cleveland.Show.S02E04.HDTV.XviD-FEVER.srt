Oh, yeah, I'd eat me.

This is my best
Halloween costume

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,322
since that time I went
as Al Sharpton back in Quahog.

19
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,025
Trick or treat?

20
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,929
Take two.

This is my

You're 14!

You're too old
to be trick-or-treatin'!

40
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,964
You go out looking
like that,

41
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,299
the other kids
will eat you

But this is no
laughing matter!

Grow up and get out
of that costume.

Hi, I'm collecting money
for the Children's Hospital.

48
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,929
Is Cleveland Brown home?

49
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,080
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:12,832
There's no one here
by that name.

51
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,469
Hey, hey, it's Cleveland Brown.

52
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,939
I have a mustache and a yellow
shirt and I talk like this.

53
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,908
Leave a message.

54
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,177

What the Halloween?!

56
00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:34,170
Check it out, Junior.

57
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,373
I'm the late baseball Hall
of Famer Willie Stargell!

58
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:39,608
And Donna's Michelle Obama.

59
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:40,710
With Oprah's arms.

00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:41,727
Hey!

61
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,883
But Pops, you said
<i>I</i> was too old to dress up.

62
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:48,884
You are.

63
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:50,353
And you're too young.

64
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,121
What?!

65
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:54,023
See, you're at
that awkward age

66
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,158
where dressing up is lame.

67
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:58,761
Donna and I can do it
because we're adults,

68
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:01,797
and for all people know,
these are our regular clothes.

69
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:03,265
And Rallo can do it

70
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,267
because he's just
a dumb little kid.

71
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:06,702
Ow, bitch!

72
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,788
Donna, the frozen peas?

73
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,689
But what about Roberta?

74
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,224
She's my age.

75
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,577
Everybody knows Halloween
is just a free pass

76
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:17,146
for teenage girls
to dress like sluts.

77
00:03:17,214 --> 00:03:19,915
They just have
to call it a costume.

78
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:21,283
So who are you
supposed to be?

79
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:23,619
I don't know. A ghost?

80
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:26,856
Man, everybody gets to dress up

81
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:29,125
but poor ol'
Cleveland Brown, Jr.

82
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:31,177
Das-a de breaks!

83
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,912
Ah...

84
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,047
Now, Junior, don't be sad.

85
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,049
You get to have fun
on Halloween, too.

86
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,984
You get to stay home
and hand out candy

87
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,387
to the trick-or-treaters!

88
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,956
Which is a big job
for you.

89
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,157
Big boy.

90
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,026
What?!
You're leaving a fat kid alone

91
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,494
with a bunch of candy?

92
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,029
No way, Hervé.

93
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,665
I've assigned a serial
number to each piece.

94
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,433
Junior, you'll need
to get a signature

95
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,735
from every kid
that comes by

96
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,071
so I can verify
that the candy went to them

97
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,439
and not into the old...

98
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,976
ancient corn dog
burial ground here.

99
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,929
Okay, have fun!

100
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,547
Cleveland, peas?

101
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:09,782
Oh.

102
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,984
Junior, you can have
these for dinner.

103
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:14,887
They're thawed
and unusual-smelling.

104
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,794
We now return
to <i>Undercover Boss.</i>

105
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:24,513
I never wash my hands
after I go to the bathroom.

106
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,098
Do you?
Why would I?

107
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,383
Aha! You're fired!

108
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:30,369
I'm tired of these
gross trouser peas.

109
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,604
You're right,

110

Why <i>am</i> I eating them?

111
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,978
I hope
it's someone with a gun

112
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,779
who'll just blow my head off.

113
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,781
Trick or treat?

114
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,850
Gee, who are you
supposed to be?

115
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:45,918
I'm Harry Potter!

116
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,553
I was being sarcastic.

117
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,189
I've only seen that
cheap, drugstore costume

118
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:51,690
a million times tonight.

119
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,493
Sorry, mister.
Our family's kind of poor.

120
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:58,280
Yeah, well, imagination doesn't
cost anything, but whatever.

121
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,251
I'll need you to sign here.

122
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:04,653
Thumbprint here.

123
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:08,991
Enjoy your damn candy.

124
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,309
This is crazy, Larry.

125
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,928
All I want is
to dress up once a year

126
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:15,631
and get some free candy,
and I can't even do that?

127
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,367
You're right, Larry!

128
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:20,302

with your mouth full.

That's madness!

Why would anyone do this?

159
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:41,619
I saw it.

It was because
of Cleveland, Ju....

Junior.

163
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:53,348
Avenge me, Cleveland.

00:06:59,221 --> 00:07:01,072
Are you happy, son?

165
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,775
Does anything about
my body language look
like I'm happy?

166
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:06,578
Well, just to make sure
you don't miss the point

167
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:10,048
of what happened here
tonight, let's review.

168
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:11,750
Okay, this melon will be you.

169
00:07:11,817 --> 00:07:14,285
Wouldn't it make more sense
if I were the pancake?

170
00:07:14,353 --> 00:07:17,872
I'm gonna put the pancake
on the melon. Just hold on.

171
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,008
Okay, now give me
your glasses.

172
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:21,059
Hold this.

173
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:21,993
Okay.

174
00:07:24,563 --> 00:07:26,081
That's what happened
to you tonight!

175
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:28,183
You got hit by eggs!

176
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,684
No-duh!
I was there!

177
00:07:29,752 --> 00:07:31,352
Junior, you
can't dress up

178
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,555
like a pancake
at your age!

179
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:35,690
The only good thing
about it is, it's a break

180
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:38,777
from that stupid red shirt
that shows your stomach.

181
00:07:38,844 --> 00:07:41,146
Roberta gets
to show her stomach.

182
00:07:41,213 --> 00:07:44,282
Again, that's because
she's a slut.

183
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,969
Ooh...! Ooh...!

184
00:07:55,294 --> 00:07:57,829
Well, Mama said
one piece a night.

185
00:08:00,232 --> 00:08:02,967
But she didn't say
how big a piece.

186
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:12,193
Really?

187
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:13,528
All right.

188
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:17,832
Hey, cool.

189
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,567
I'm Cap'n Crunch.

190
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:21,352
Cleveland, come with me.

191
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,654
I want to show
you something.

192
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:24,589
If Cap'n Crunch
is out there, I'm-a flip out.

193
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,076
Time for me to grow up.

194
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:29,711
Good-bye, Big Crayon.

195
00:08:29,778 --> 00:08:31,679
I had fun playing with you

196
00:08:31,747 --> 00:08:34,015
and pretending an evil wizard
shrunk me.

197
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,117
Good-bye, Easy-Bake Oven.

198
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:39,237
I had fun making tiny cakes
with you and pretending

199
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:42,006
an evil wizard turned me
into a giant.

200
00:08:42,074 --> 00:08:44,909
Well, Larry, I guess this is it.

201
00:08:44,977 --> 00:08:46,845
I'll never forget you.

202
00:08:46,912 --> 00:08:48,446
I love you.

203
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:52,116
Shh...

204
00:08:52,184 --> 00:08:54,118
It's okay. It's okay.

205
00:08:54,186 --> 00:08:56,371
It's okay.

206
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:57,622
Let go, Larry.

207
00:08:57,673 --> 00:08:59,207
Let go!

208
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:00,642
Oh, my God!

209
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:01,876
I know.

210
00:09:01,944 --> 00:09:03,578
He's devastated
about last night.

211
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:04,979
You have to stop him.

212
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:06,047
Stop him?

213
00:09:06,115 --> 00:09:07,649
Do you know how long
I've waited

214
00:09:07,716 --> 00:09:08,950
for this day to come?

215
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:10,602
You can't let your son
throw away everything

216
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:12,153
that defines him!

217
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:15,773
Donna, he's a teenage boy
who talks to stuffed animals,

218
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:17,942
and worse, listens to 'em,

219
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,811
and then changes his opinion

220
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,579
based on what
they've told him!

221
00:09:22,882 --> 00:09:24,816
Look, I'll make this work,

222
00:09:24,884 --> 00:09:27,585
just like I made
that time machine work.

223
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:29,153
Hey, younger me.

224
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:30,555
Hey, older me.

225
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,323
Raiders are gonna
win tomorrow.

226
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:34,125
Yes! Cha-ching!

227
00:09:34,193 --> 00:09:36,728
But think twice
before using the winnings

228
00:09:36,795 --> 00:09:38,529
for swashbuckling lessons.

229
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:40,832
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

230
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,135
I'm gonna get
swashbuckling lessons!

231
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:49,857
Oh, man, I cannot eat
like that anymore.

232
00:09:49,925 --> 00:09:51,859
It was fine when I was four,

233
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:54,462
but the old metabolism
ain't what it used to be.

234
00:09:56,165 --> 00:09:59,601
All right, a bonus piece
of Tuffy Taffy.

235
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:01,102
Ahh! My tooth!

236
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,572
Ah! Oh, no, Mama was right!

237
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,841
My teeth <i>are</i> rotting out!

238
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:09,210
Oh, she's gonna kill me!

239
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:10,845
Oh, great.

240
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:13,982
Now I look like workplace
predator, David Letterman.

241
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:18,119
"Ah, ah, have sex with me, ah!"

242
00:10:19,888 --> 00:10:22,523
Now, this is starting
to look like a bedroom.

243
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,691
You like it?

244
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:24,892
I don't know.

245
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,211
It looks nice,
but it's not really me.

246
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,813
Oh, don't worry.

247
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:31,115
It will be as soon
as we change everything

248
00:10:31,183 --> 00:10:32,984
about the way you look,
think and act.

249
00:10:33,052 --> 00:10:35,053
I don't want to do that!

250
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,822
So I guess now
I do want to do that.

251
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,123
That a boy!

252
00:10:39,191 --> 00:10:41,526
<i>Donna, get in here!</i>

253
00:10:41,593 --> 00:10:45,330
Allow me to present
as you've never seen him before,

254
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:49,334
the all-new Cleveland Brown, Jr.

255
00:10:50,152 --> 00:10:51,286
'Sup?

256
00:10:51,353 --> 00:10:53,755
Wow, this is quite
a transformation.

257
00:10:53,822 --> 00:10:55,673
What exactly did
you two do today?

258
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:58,676
Nothin'. Guy stuff.

259
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:00,945
Like if I said,
"Boobies, 12:00,"

260
00:11:01,013 --> 00:11:03,898
that would just confuse you
because you aren't a guy.

261
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:06,334
By the way, Dad,
boobies, 12:00.

262
00:11:06,402 --> 00:11:07,552
Look, Junior.

263
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:09,854
The big hand's on the two.

264
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:12,390
All right, then.

265
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,827
I'm going to go take a poop
like a man-- standing up.

266
00:11:15,894 --> 00:11:17,679
Well...

267
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:20,898
14 years ago,
I created a child,

268
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:23,501
but now,
I've created a son.

269
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:24,902
I don't know, Cleveland.

270
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,372
Like my cousin Ernestine
always used to say,

271
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:29,640
"A frog doesn't look good
in a fur coat."

272
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,742
Uh-huh.

273
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:32,543
Why doesn't she
say it anymore?

274
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:35,279
She finally found one that
did look good in a fur coat.

275
00:11:35,347 --> 00:11:36,647
Then she took her life.

276
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:37,782
Mm.

277
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,916
The point is,
Cleveland,

278
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:40,618
I'm not convinced
Junior's happy.

279
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:42,053
Well, I'm not convinced

280
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:44,055
the lump on my testicle
is benign,

281
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:46,491
but you don't see me
running off to the doctor.

282
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:01,239
I miss me.

283
00:12:09,351 --> 00:12:11,219
Hey, Mama, you know
what would be fun?

284
00:12:11,286 --> 00:12:13,187
If you put all this food
in a blender for me,

285
00:12:13,255 --> 00:12:14,555
and I drank it with a straw,

286
00:12:14,623 --> 00:12:15,890
wouldn't that be fun?

287
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,393
Ooh! I want my food
in the blender, too.

288
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,494
No blenders!

289
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:20,862
Everybody eat
your damn food!

290
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:22,563
Shoot.
Shoot.

291
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:24,482
RALLO and CLEVELAND:
Can't eat smoothie
in my own house.

292
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,167
Mom, I need
a late curfew tonight.

293
00:12:26,235 --> 00:12:28,002
Oliver Wilkerson's
having a party.

294
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,821
Oh, a cool kids party?

295
00:12:29,888 --> 00:12:31,472
What are we talking?
A house party?

296
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,274
Pool party? Kegger? Rave?

297
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:35,143
Toga party? Pajama jammy-jam?

298
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,578
Pub crawl? Tea party?
Reggae sun splash?

299
00:12:37,646 --> 00:12:40,114
Stag party? After-party?
Lemon party?

300
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:42,784
White elephant? Sadie Hawkins?
<i>Quinceañera?</i>

301
00:12:42,851 --> 00:12:44,018
Nah, just a party.

302
00:12:44,086 --> 00:12:45,670
I love parties.

303
00:12:45,737 --> 00:12:47,071
Well, guess what, Dad.

304
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:49,207
I'm going to hit up
Oliver' s party, too,

305
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:51,509
now that I'm cool
and think parties are cool.

306
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:53,027
That's my boy.

307
00:12:53,095 --> 00:12:55,396
Now, when you go in the
bathroom at the party,

308
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:57,999
just know there will
be pee everywhere.

309
00:12:58,066 --> 00:13:00,301
It's not your job
to clean it up.

310
00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:02,470
Right. It's my pleasure.

311
00:13:02,538 --> 00:13:04,705
No!
I mean, I'm not
going to clean it.

312
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:07,308
I'm going to pee
all over the place.

313
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:09,444
Donna, may I pee
all over our bathroom?

314
00:13:09,511 --> 00:13:10,511
No.

315
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:12,346
Aw. In the yard?

316
00:13:12,414 --> 00:13:14,348
If you finish
your vegetables.

317
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:20,438
Well, boys,
guess whose son

318
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:23,074
is out partying
with the most popular

319
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:26,244
and most sexually active kid
at Stoolbend High?

320
00:13:26,311 --> 00:13:28,045
Junior's hanging out
with Roberta?

321
00:13:28,113 --> 00:13:30,014
No. Oliver Wilkerson.

322
00:13:30,082 --> 00:13:33,251
Wow. Notot too, uh...
not too shaggy there.

323
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:35,319
The Junior's finally hanging out
with the cool kids.

324
00:13:35,387 --> 00:13:37,221
I hung out with the
cool kids last week.

325
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:38,422
Bought them beer.

326
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,757
Tried to stay
and drink it with them.

327
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:40,992
Told me to get lost.

328
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:42,527
Asked them to pay me back
for the booze.

329
00:13:42,594 --> 00:13:43,594
Kicked my ass.

330
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:44,896
Called their school.

331
00:13:44,963 --> 00:13:46,180
Got them banned
from the eighth grade formal.

332
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:47,548
Who's the cool kid now?

333
00:13:47,616 --> 00:13:49,484
Uh... you.

334
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:51,569
Well, I'm going
to head over to that party

335
00:13:51,637 --> 00:13:53,588
and see my boy
in action.

336
00:13:53,655 --> 00:13:55,423
Gus, can I have
the rest of this to go?

337
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:58,025
Sure thing, favorite
patron of mine.

338
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,414
Thanks, Gus.

339
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:15,560
Oh, I got to hide this tooth

340
00:14:15,627 --> 00:14:17,261
somewhere Mama
will never find it.

341
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:19,463
Under the pillow!

342
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:23,034
Oh, I'm far too fretful
to fall asleep.

343
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:25,803
May as well call
into Sports Chat.

344
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:27,071
Hello, caller.

345
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:29,140
Welcome to Sports Chat.

346
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,076
I'm Dwayne Meighan,
host of Sports Chat,

347
00:14:32,144 --> 00:14:33,978
and you are caller.

348
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:35,913
Don't try to listen to yourself

349
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:38,382
on the radio
while we're on the phone

350
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,152
because there was all sort
of problem with this.

351
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,821
Be this understood,
go ahead, caller.

352
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:45,389
Thank you for calling.

353
00:14:45,457 --> 00:14:47,658
I'm Dwayne Meighan,
and you're on Sports Chat.

354
00:14:47,726 --> 00:14:49,293
Now you say.

355
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:50,861
Hello? Am I on the air?

356
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:52,730
Caller, you are on the air.

357
00:14:52,798 --> 00:14:55,600
You are not trying to listen
to yourself, were you?

358
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:56,601
No.

359
00:14:56,668 --> 00:14:57,602
Go ahead, caller.

360
00:14:57,669 --> 00:14:58,636
I'm Dwayne Meighan.

361
00:14:58,704 --> 00:15:00,171
Now you say.

362
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:01,906
Uh... yeah.

363
00:15:01,974 --> 00:15:03,808
How about the Yankees?

364
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,743
Jeter...

365
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:07,745
A-Rod, all those guys.

366
00:15:09,715 --> 00:15:11,549
I'm sorry, caller.

367
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:14,652
I miss what you had said
on account of I couldn't resist

368
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,388
turning on my radio
here at the station.

369
00:15:17,456 --> 00:15:19,624
Mm. Talking baseball.

370
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:26,197
There's my party boy.

371
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,335
Lots of righteous
babes here, eh, dudes?

372
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:33,337
With their nipples
and whatnot.

373
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:35,273
You're gay-- gay pancake.

374
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,124
Here. How about a drink?

375
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:40,811
Okay, my turn.

376
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:48,803
So you just stood
there and watched?

377
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,104
You didn't stop
those boys?

378
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:51,539
Oh, yeah, Donna.

379
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:54,742
The gay pancake needs his daddy
to save him.

380
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,911
That would have looked
real cool.

381
00:15:56,979 --> 00:15:58,112
Man, what a party.

382
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,714
It was sick.

383
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:03,501
I hung out with my new friends,
had some drinks, some laughs,

384
00:16:03,568 --> 00:16:05,603
and I definitely
was not duct-taped

385
00:16:05,671 --> 00:16:07,738
to a male mannequin
and put up on the roof

386
00:16:07,806 --> 00:16:10,091
and laughed at
by helicopter police.

387
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,628
He's covering. That did happen.

388
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:15,796
I should have
changed him better.

389
00:16:15,864 --> 00:16:17,398
Cleveland, you can't
force a sweet,

390
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:19,467
round peg like Junior
into a stupid,

391
00:16:19,534 --> 00:16:21,452
beer-chugging,
sports-loving square hole.

392
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,689
Girl, you did not just tell me
how to raise my children.

393
00:16:24,756 --> 00:16:26,173
That child has stamped out

394
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:27,808
everything
that makes him unique.

395
00:16:27,876 --> 00:16:29,276
And for what?

396
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:31,278
All for the approval
of a couple of bullies?

397
00:16:31,346 --> 00:16:32,713
And his father?

398
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:34,248
You're right.

399
00:16:34,316 --> 00:16:35,866
What have I done
to my boy?

400
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:37,234
I've ruined him,

401
00:16:37,285 --> 00:16:39,970
just like I ruined
David Carradine's funeral.

402
00:16:40,038 --> 00:16:43,507
David Carradine brought
pleasure to millions,

403
00:16:43,575 --> 00:16:46,644
but none more so than himself.

404
00:16:49,214 --> 00:16:51,716
When David had
a particularly meaty part,

405
00:16:51,783 --> 00:16:53,851
he would roll up his sleeves

406
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,587
and milk it
for all it was worth.

407
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,576
But David was
at his best

408
00:17:02,644 --> 00:17:04,145
when he was just
hanging around,

409
00:17:04,212 --> 00:17:06,814
spurting enthusiastically
to friends

410
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:09,316
till he was blue in the face.

411
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:14,572
I'm sorry.

412
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:16,240
No, it's okay.

413
00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:18,459
Stand up. Stand up, would you?

414
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:22,797
Go ahead.

415
00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:24,899
David would have wanted you
to laugh.

416
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:28,469
The guy died of autoerotic
asphyxiation, for God's sake.

417
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:30,271
You can die from that?

418
00:17:46,805 --> 00:17:48,472
What up, brah?

419
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,158
Junior, there's someone
here who wants to see you.

420
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:53,077
Larry, you're alive!

421
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:54,578
No, he's not.

422
00:17:54,646 --> 00:17:56,163
He's a stuffed animal.

423
00:17:56,231 --> 00:17:58,466
But I went and dug him
out of a Dumpster,

424
00:17:58,533 --> 00:18:00,101
wrung out the
garbage juice

425
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:02,002
and rubbed him down
with a Bounce sheet

426
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,072
because I want you to
be who you really are.

427
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,507
We're going out.

428
00:18:06,575 --> 00:18:08,743
We're making our own Halloween.

429
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,378
Hey. You got-a coconuts
in your head?

430
00:18:11,446 --> 00:18:13,414
Everyone's going to pick
on me even worse

431
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:15,349
if I'm the only one
in costume.

432
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,651
Who said you'd be the only one?

433
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:19,220
I'm toast.

434
00:18:19,304 --> 00:18:20,721
I'm honey.

435
00:18:20,806 --> 00:18:22,673
I'm Angela Lansbury's
left breast.

436
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:24,241
Lester!
Fried egg.

437
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:25,259
And I'm bacon.

438
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:26,927
And together...

439
00:18:26,995 --> 00:18:29,430
We're all part
of this balanced breakfast.

440
00:18:29,498 --> 00:18:30,664
Wow!

441
00:18:30,732 --> 00:18:32,533
How did you get those costumes
so fast?

442
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:34,018
I had them at home.

443
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:35,920
Kendra and I
do a little role-playing.

444
00:18:35,987 --> 00:18:39,623
It gets her hot
when I dress up as big food.

445
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:41,075
Hello?

446
00:18:41,143 --> 00:18:44,979

with the bacon?

Mama, I ate a bunch of candy,

and I lost my tooth
just like you said,

470
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:23,677

turned into a quarter,
