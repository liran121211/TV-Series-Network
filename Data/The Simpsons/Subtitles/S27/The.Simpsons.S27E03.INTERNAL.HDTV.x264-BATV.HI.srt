An astronaut baby.

(baby laughs)

14
00:00:50,532 --> 00:00:54,034
Hey. Oh, have you ever
turned<i> on</i> a TV?

15
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:56,970
It's my mother's
birthday.

16
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:58,371
And you only turn 80 once.

17
00:00:58,407 --> 00:01:00,807
Or, in the case
of most people, no times.

18
00:01:00,842 --> 00:01:02,776
Now, put your good clothes on.

19
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:06,279
I'm already in a dress and
pearls, and I'm eight years old.

20
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:08,114
Can't we go
to her 81st birthday?

21
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,816
That's the big one.

22
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:14,120
Why does visiting my family
always have to be so hard?

23
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:16,956
Because, face it, Marge,
your family doesn't like me.

24
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:19,959
Never did, not even
when I had hair and a future

25
00:01:19,995 --> 00:01:21,795
and a bitchin' Pontiac GTO.

26
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,196
Where is that
car, Homer?

27
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:25,031
I went to a music festival,

28
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:26,800
and I couldn't remember
where I parked it.

29
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:31,638
(playing weakly):
♪ I'm a space cowboy. ♪

30
00:01:33,642 --> 00:01:37,710
Homie, I feel about my family
like you felt about that car.

31
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:40,146
No one loves a
person that much.

32
00:01:40,182 --> 00:01:42,148
Please go, for me?

33
00:01:42,184 --> 00:01:44,551
All right, but
remember the signal.

34
00:01:44,586 --> 00:01:47,387
If I tug my ear,
it's time for us to leave.

35
00:01:47,422 --> 00:01:48,822
I'm switching to my left ear

36
00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:50,690
because of what
happened last time.

37
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:19,085
Uh-uh, no you don't.

38
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:21,087
Your grandmother
knit this for you,

39
00:02:21,123 --> 00:02:23,123
so act like you wear
it all the time.

40
00:02:27,162 --> 00:02:29,162
(groans)

41
00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:39,472
She has a juice box.

42
00:02:39,508 --> 00:02:41,641
Why can't I have
a juice box?

43
00:02:41,676 --> 00:02:44,077
Because when she
sticks in the straw,

44
00:02:44,112 --> 00:02:46,613
she doesn't slip
and hit an artery.

45
00:02:46,648 --> 00:02:49,048
Oh, I'll never have juice.

52
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:07,167
Jacqueline, I took the
money I usually give

53
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:11,404
to con artists and preachers
and bought you these flowers.

54
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,409
Oh, nothing tops
a simple romantic gesture.

55
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:21,047
Except a rich man
flaunting his wealth.

56
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:27,520
The one thing I can't beat--
competition.

57
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,523
(pops loudly)

58
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:32,959
Oh, Jacqueline, I
fell in love with you

59
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:34,961
the moment I came
down with dementia.

60
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:38,698
So to win your heart, I got you
an old-fashioned music player.

61
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:40,967
Meh.
(groaning)

62
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:42,368

63
00:03:42,404 --> 00:03:43,970
(gasps)

64
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,207
No one said
there'd be music.

65
00:03:47,242 --> 00:03:49,642
There's always room
for cello.

66
00:03:49,678 --> 00:03:52,679
(plays Cello Suite
No. 1 by Bach)

67
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,050
I know when I'm
licked, Burns.

68
00:03:57,085 --> 00:03:58,885
She's yours.

69
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,320
Um, not interested.

70
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:01,821
I just don't want
you to have her.

71
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:04,657
Wow, that's the meanest
thing I ever heard,

72
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:07,227
and I used to practice
cello on the subway.

73
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:11,831
D'oh!
I'm next!

74
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:13,233
Whee!

75
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:15,068

76
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:16,903
Hey, you two,
quit having fun.

77
00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:19,339
Trust me, nothing I've
done today has been fun.

78
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:22,175
Hey, hey, the plastic's
here for a reason--

79
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,576
to keep the couch clean.

80
00:04:23,612 --> 00:04:26,412
Watch and learn, boy.

81
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:28,948
Voilà, now I take
a simple napkin and...

82
00:04:30,585 --> 00:04:31,551

84
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:36,256
Who's ready to see some
slides of us as teenagers?

85
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,824
(groaning)

86
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:39,058
Here are the slides.

87
00:04:39,094 --> 00:04:41,594
Oh, just one box.

88
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,429
Five terabytes.

89
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:46,933
That's over 50,000 carousels
of family fun.

90
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:48,968
(groans loudly)

91
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:53,506
Here's us walking up the steps

92
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,509

pyramid of the sun.

93

Walking, walking,

Oh.
Walking, walking,

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,626
Oh, I sure miss Dad.

102
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:16,629
We're here to watch
old photos, not reminisce.

Walking, walking...

104
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:19,465
How did Grampa Bouvier die?

105
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:21,100
No one's ever told us.

106
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:23,970
You know what, I
actually don't know.

107
00:05:24,005 --> 00:05:25,805
Me neither.
Not a clue.

108
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,309
Girls, I'm afraid I didn't tell
any of you for a reason.

00:05:33,982 --> 00:05:35,782
The real story,

112
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:38,785
and it was something people were
ashamed to say at the time,

113
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,154
is that he died of lung cancer.

114
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:45,591
Mom, how could you know that
and still let us smoke?

115
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:48,094
I thought it made
you look cool.

116
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:53,232
Hey, Lis, do you think I can
climb walls like Spider-Man

117
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:55,234
with denture cream
on my hands?

118
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,070
(screams)
Nope.

119
00:05:57,105 --> 00:05:59,472
Next time, you should
wait for my answer.

120
00:05:59,507 --> 00:06:03,309
Knock it off, your grandmother's
bathroom is not a toy chest.

121
00:06:03,345 --> 00:06:04,677
Ooh, Vicodin.

122
00:06:04,713 --> 00:06:07,113

Selma dear.

123
00:06:07,148 --> 00:06:09,549

124
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:21,194

00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,301
Patty, all your
tests are positive.

180
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,736
I mean, negative.

181
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:32,737
Always get those
two confused.

182
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,739
You're fine.
(chuckles)

183
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,507
But I still smell smoke.

184
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,342
(sniffs)
That's odd.

185
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,343
So do I.

186
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,678
Do you smell
anything, Selma?

187
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,513
Hmm, uh-uh, nope.

188
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,514
Wait a minute.

189
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,849
Are you smoking?

190
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,923
That's right, I am.

191
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,759
I quit for only ten minutes
before I relapsed.

192
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:59,163
And it was the best
cigarette of my life.

193
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,466
(scoffs) I have never
been angrier at you.

194
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,302
Me, too-- this
is a hospital.

195
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,937
If you want to smoke,

196
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,972
go do it in the stairwell
with the doctors.

197
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,143
I'll miss you so much.

198
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,544
Leave me Jub-Jub.

199
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,012
Fine.

200
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,985
At least you still smoke.

201
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,856
I hate it when you
and Selma fight.

202
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,125
Me, too. I also hate it
when they agree.

203
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,227
Homer, please be nice.

204
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,962
Patty's our guest.

205
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,163
For how long?

206
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,231
Where's she gonna sleep?

207
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:34,498
On our couch.

208
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:36,734
That's where we do
our couch gags!

209
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:37,902
See?

210
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:38,970
Oh, fine.

211
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,271
She'll stay with the baby.

212
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,174
Well, Magster,
it looks like

213
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,177
you and I are going
to be cellmates.

214
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,645
(chuckles)

215
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,847
(buzzing)

216
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,184
(screams)
Nature!

217
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,552
Shoo! Shoo!

218
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,020
I've got a hot
curling iron!

219
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,055
Hold this.
(grunts)

220
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,927
Oh, Marge,
the kids are all asleep

221
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,996
and the dog's been walked.

222
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,832
There's only
one thing left to do.

223
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,367
(sexy purr)

224
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,202
Did you turn the
security alarm on?

225
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,671
It's still broken.

226
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:17,008
Ooh, well, then
come here, you.

227
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,609
(Patty snoring)

228
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,278
(shouts)
What the hell was that?!

229
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,946
It's just my sister snoring.

230
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,215
She has a very fatty septum.

231
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,051
But it doesn't have
to ruin our fun.

232
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,719
(snoring continues)

233
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,455
(both moaning)

234
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,959
(gasps, coughs)

235
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,662
(owl hooting)

236
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,173
(snoring)
(music playing intermittently)

237
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,160
Okay, which of you kids
knows how to drive?

238
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:12,163
And which is sober?

239
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,099
Whew, thank God
for Designated Dorothy.

240
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,701
(engine starts, truck backfires)

241
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,280
All right, everybody
go to bed.

242
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,482
Those of you who got
to get up early,

243
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,651
sleep on top of the pile.

244
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,986
Hey, Brandine!

245
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,621
I caught us a possum!

246
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,457
You want to name it

247
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,492
before we eat it
or after?

248
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,493
During!

249
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,162
Beauregard,
you've been promoted

250
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,364
from guarding my family

251
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,399
to guarding this possum.

252
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,568
That's a good dog.

253
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:54,071
Lift with your legs.

254
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,434
Hmm.

255
00:12:58,469 --> 00:13:00,069
Hey, baby.

256
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:03,606
How about that rain check
for last night?

257
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:04,840
PATTY: Aah!
Aah!

258
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:06,308
Aah, don't look at me!

259
00:13:06,344 --> 00:13:08,744
But you're everywhere!
(gasping) Freak!

260
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:10,346
(shouts)
Don't you ever knock?

261
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:12,448
Aah... ah!
Get out of here, go away!

262
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:14,517
Thank God I'm blind.

263
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:16,118
Yo, I'm next.

264
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:17,286
No!

265
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:19,088
Whoa! What the hell?

266
00:13:19,123 --> 00:13:20,823
I did that
with love, boy.

267
00:13:20,858 --> 00:13:22,258
What's all the hubbub?

268
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:24,093
Oh, thank you, Dad.
It's okay, son.

269
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:26,195
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
It's okay, it's okay.

270
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,464
No, really, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

271
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:30,366
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

272
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:31,600
All right, already!

273
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:33,469
Just take a shower.

274
00:13:34,872 --> 00:13:37,373
I need someone to talk to.

275
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:40,709
Thank God I've got a past full
of lonely men to draw from.

276
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:43,379
Mm-hmm.

277
00:13:43,414 --> 00:13:45,514
Disco Stu is over you.

278
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:48,821
Oh, Disco Stu

279
00:13:48,856 --> 00:13:51,257
needs a Zoloft or two.

280
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:52,825
(grunts)

281
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,426
Who am I kidding?

282
00:13:54,462 --> 00:13:56,095
The one I should be talking to

283
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,764
is the one who's
always been there for me...

284
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,499
my cigarette.

285
00:14:00,534 --> 00:14:01,901
Forget about your sister.

286
00:14:01,936 --> 00:14:03,535
You've got me.

287
00:14:03,571 --> 00:14:05,437
For the rest of your life
I'll be the first thing

288
00:14:05,473 --> 00:14:07,273
you think about every morning.

289
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:12,378
And the last thing you do
every night.

290
00:14:12,413 --> 00:14:15,247
Hmm, looks like I have
a choice to make.

291
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:17,016
(grunting)
Oh!

292
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:20,152
I'm in your hair!
(laughs)

293
00:14:24,158 --> 00:14:26,125
Uh...
(clears his throat)

294
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,928
Listen, about this morning,

295
00:14:28,963 --> 00:14:31,764
I'm sorry I walked in on you!

296
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,766
(grumbling)

297
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:35,935
Oh! Oh, yeah.

298
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,403
I'm about to
say something

299
00:14:37,438 --> 00:14:40,372
I never thought I'd say
to you-- something nice.

300
00:14:40,408 --> 00:14:41,740
Hmm?
(sighs)

301
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:44,143
I only mock you
because I'm jealous

302
00:14:44,178 --> 00:14:46,745
of what Marge
has in you.

303
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:48,714
I only have Selma.

304
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:51,383
And now I don't
even have that.

305
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:53,485
(deep sigh)

306
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:55,821
Oh, Patty,
I've waited so long

307
00:14:55,856 --> 00:14:58,090
for you to open
a window of niceness.

308
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,258
(grunts)
That was it!

309
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:00,326
Window shut!

310
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:01,961
(doorbell rings)

311
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:04,930
Ah, what the heck!

312
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:08,100
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!

313
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:10,602
Aah... ah!

314
00:15:10,638 --> 00:15:12,304
What are you doing here?

315
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,173
Apologizing.

316
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,641
And I want you to know

317
00:15:15,676 --> 00:15:18,444
I quit smoking for good.

318
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:20,346
You quit for me?

319
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:21,847
I quit for us.

320
00:15:21,882 --> 00:15:24,116
Hmm, that's
actually more selfish.

321
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:26,285
But it sounds really nice.

322
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,820
(grunting)

323
00:15:27,855 --> 00:15:29,288
Okay, Maggie,
throw the ball to me.

324
00:15:29,323 --> 00:15:30,656
Throw the ball.

325
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:34,793
Okay, how about
I throw the ball?

326
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:36,595
It's okay.

327
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,832

But you got fingernails
to chew on.

361
00:19:10,277 --> 00:19:12,411
Who knows what's under them?

362
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:14,913
Ooh, I got pizza!

363
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:16,582
I got poop.

364
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:18,984
It's nice to have
you back, Patty.

365
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:21,720
I had to do some things I
regretted 'cause you were gone.

366
00:19:21,755 --> 00:19:24,590
You said it was
for real this time.

367
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,825
I said what you wanted to hear!

368
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,661
Disco Stu is back
on Tinder.

369
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:30,729
(door closes)

370
00:19:30,764 --> 00:19:33,098
It's nice to be back.

371
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:34,933
Since I've stopped smoking,

372
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:37,102
my sense of smell
has really come back.

373
00:19:37,137 --> 00:19:38,537
Uh-huh.

374
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:40,739
Who knew a small apartment
with two women,

375
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:44,409
a baby and an iguana
would smell so bad?

376
00:19:46,146 --> 00:19:48,580
Cigarette?
Yes!

377
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:52,618
Ah.

378
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:55,220
Here's to smoking
and you.

379
00:19:55,256 --> 00:19:58,223
Two things that'll
always be in my heart.

380
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,860
Is this a happy ending?

381
00:20:01,895 --> 00:20:03,395
It's edgy.

382
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,599
♪ Together forever
and never to part ♪

383
00:20:07,635 --> 00:20:10,802
♪ Together forever, we two. ♪

384
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:29,195
(squawks)

385
00:20:29,231 --> 00:20:31,197
Hoppy, you're back!

386
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:32,465
(Cletus' voice):
Hey, Brandine!

387
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,834
Put out
the fancy possum china!

388
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:38,875
I've heard of wanting a cracker,
but becoming one-- oh, no!
