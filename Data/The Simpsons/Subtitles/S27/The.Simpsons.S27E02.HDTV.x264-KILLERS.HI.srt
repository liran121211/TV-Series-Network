00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:00,984
and I'm challenging
you to an Eat-down!

182
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,120
What's that--
some kind of eat-down?

183
00:08:03,155 --> 00:08:04,888
It's my new show
where I use

184
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:06,890
my big-time New York
City chef skills

185
00:08:06,926 --> 00:08:09,259
to obliterate amateur cooks.

186
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:12,095
Who would watch
such a one-sided farce?

187
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:13,430
I'm in.

188
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:14,832
This Eat-down's
gonna throw down

189
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:17,401
at the Springfield
Barbecue Festival.

190
00:08:17,436 --> 00:08:20,904
And when I'm done, you're gonna
wish you never heard of food!

191
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,273
(people oohing)
Buy my cookware!

192
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:25,742
(gasps): I'm competing
against Scotty Boom!

193
00:08:25,778 --> 00:08:28,946
He's got what
all great chefs have--

194
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:30,347
yelling.

195
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:33,317
ALL (chanting):
Homer! Homer! Homer!

196
00:08:34,887 --> 00:08:36,353
You were right, greasy hobo.

197
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:40,090
Nothing fixes bad times
like good food.

198
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,692
Up here,
I can watch

199
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,529
anyone in the world
take a shower.

200
00:08:46,966 --> 00:08:48,131
(grunting)

201
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:49,800
Okay, pork, I'm gonna throw you

202
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:51,668
in that magic smoker
for 24 hours

203
00:08:51,704 --> 00:08:53,136
and win that cook-off.

204
00:08:53,172 --> 00:08:56,273
I only wish you could be alive
to see it.

205
00:08:56,308 --> 00:08:57,508
(British accent):
Then I suppose

206
00:08:57,543 --> 00:08:59,376
this is my last chance to say

207
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:01,144
I love you.

208
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,679
Aw...

209
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:04,314
(gasps)

210
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,117
Oh, no!

211
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:08,986
Our smoker's been stolen!

212
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:10,487
Why?!

213
00:09:10,523 --> 00:09:12,656
And when?!

214
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:15,192
You didn't lock it up?

215
00:09:15,227 --> 00:09:16,693
You fat idiot!

216
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:19,363
I'm out of here.

217
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:20,398
(groans)

218
00:09:22,254 --> 00:09:24,835
(moans)
You'll find the Hive, right?

219
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:26,902
Tell me you'll find my smoker!

220
00:09:26,938 --> 00:09:28,204
Ah, don't you worry.

221
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:30,406
The Springfield PD
is on the case.

222
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:32,174
Ah, yeah.

223
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,010
Uh, well, I wouldn't
get your hopes up.

224
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:36,212
High-end barbeques like yours
are easy pickings.

225
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:38,714
Smokeheads grab them at night,
clean them up.

226
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,483
Next thing you know,

227
00:09:40,518 --> 00:09:42,485
it's cooking
another family's hot dogs.

228
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,755
Humanity-- what a joke.
(spits)

229
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,922
So, it's gone.

230
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,691
It's really gone.

231
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:51,227
All that's left is
the smell of burning hickory

232
00:09:51,262 --> 00:09:53,829
and three
tiny little wheel prints.

233
00:09:53,865 --> 00:09:56,532
Good night, sweet prints.

234
00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:09,412
So you lost your grill.

235
00:10:09,447 --> 00:10:11,447
Snap out of it,
you big fat baby.

236
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,516
Son, this is so much more

237
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:15,618
than just losing
an outdoor cooking device.

238
00:10:15,653 --> 00:10:17,253
How to explain this
to a child?

239
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:20,056
This is the death of hope.

240
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:22,291
What are you talking about?

241
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:24,226
Everything good
that comes into our lives,

242
00:10:24,262 --> 00:10:26,228
the universe takes away.

243
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:28,397
So from now on,
I'm just gonna lie here

244
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:30,700
and never care again.

245
00:10:30,735 --> 00:10:32,868
Come on, you know
your life sucks.

246
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:34,403
Just get drunk
like you always do.

247
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:35,805
I don't want to.

248
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,073
(gasps)

249
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:39,709
(moans)

250
00:10:39,744 --> 00:10:41,043
Look at him.

251
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:42,478
He's lying there
like a beached whale

252
00:10:42,513 --> 00:10:44,046
waiting to explode.

253
00:10:44,082 --> 00:10:46,282
Maybe we should try to
track down that smoker.

254
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:47,817
I don't know.

255
00:10:47,852 --> 00:10:49,652
The whole barbequing scene
is pretty pro-meat.

256
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:52,455
And all that smoke
pollutes the environment.

257
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,724
This isn't about your
boyfriend, the planet.

258
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,093
I've never seen him
this beaten down.

259
00:10:59,097 --> 00:11:00,396
Okay, look for clues.

260
00:11:00,431 --> 00:11:01,931
Are there any mud
samples we can trace

261
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:04,066
to local heaths and moors?

262
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:06,435
Sorry, I've been watching
a lot of<i> Sherlock.</i>

263
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:08,170
(barking)

264
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:09,438
Knock it off, boy.

265
00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:10,740
I don't have any meat for you.

266
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:12,508
Get down!
Wait!

267
00:11:12,543 --> 00:11:14,410
Santa's Little Helper
was in the yard last night

268
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,846
when the smoker was stolen,
but he didn't make a peep.

269
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:18,714
Why?

270
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:21,951
(gasps)

271
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:23,753
"Natural Peanut Butter."

272
00:11:23,788 --> 00:11:25,921
What if someone
gave this to the dog

273
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:27,656
so he'd be licking
instead of barking

274
00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:29,692
while they took
the smoker?!

275
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:31,293
(gasps)
You got a clue, boy!

276
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:33,462
A clue! (laughs)

277
00:11:33,498 --> 00:11:34,930
Who's a smart dog?

278
00:11:34,966 --> 00:11:37,199
Who's
a smart dog?

279
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:39,835
(panting)

280
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:41,504
(barking)

281
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:43,038
(panting)

282
00:11:43,074 --> 00:11:44,273
(bell clangs)
ANNOUNCER:<i> You're watching</i>

283
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:46,375
Eat-down<i> with Scotty Boom.</i>

284
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:47,877
Come on, Homie.

285
00:11:47,912 --> 00:11:51,180
We can't let this
Empire State jabroni beat us.

286
00:11:51,215 --> 00:11:54,016
This week I took on the Gilbert
family of Portland, Maine.

287
00:11:54,051 --> 00:11:56,719
They've been making clam chowder
for generations.

288
00:11:56,754 --> 00:11:59,722
How is that better than
something I spent a day on?

289
00:11:59,757 --> 00:12:01,390
I win!

290
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:03,392
Manhattan chowder, baby!

291
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:05,194
NYC!

292
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:07,730
Greatest city,
greatest chowder!

293
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:11,200
The Gilbert family
has learned a valuable lesson--

294
00:12:11,235 --> 00:12:13,702
screw everything.

295
00:12:13,738 --> 00:12:16,705
Dad, we're gonna
find that smoker!

296
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:19,475
To try is to fail!

297
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,076
There's only
one store in town

298
00:12:21,112 --> 00:12:23,412
that sells
all-natural peanut butter.

299
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:25,681
(bell dings)

300
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:34,056
Don't worry, I know how
to talk to these people.

301
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:36,559
Thank goodness
you have organic fennel.

302
00:12:36,594 --> 00:12:40,529
The fennel at the farmer's
market is only transitional.

303
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:42,164
(groans)
Typical.

304
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,234
Small farmers ruining it
for the really small farmers.

305
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:47,369
So, could you maybe tell me

306
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:49,772
who bought this brand
of peanut butter?

307
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:51,407
Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.

308
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:53,375
You want me to violate
my customers' privacy?

309
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:54,910
Who are you working for?

310
00:12:54,946 --> 00:12:56,712
The NSA?
Big pharma?

311
00:12:56,747 --> 00:12:58,447
Amazon Prime?

312
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:00,850
Tell us! Tell us!
Tell us! Tell us!

313
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:02,084
(moans)

314
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:03,385
My hoops!
(grunting)

315
00:13:03,421 --> 00:13:05,888
My ridiculous flesh hoops!

316
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:08,757
There!

317
00:13:08,793 --> 00:13:10,359
Someone's ringing
up peanut butter.

318
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,495
(both gasp)
Nelson!

319
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:15,631
What are you playing
there, Nelson?

320
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,433
<i>Clash of Castles?</i>

321
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:18,701
So what if it is?

322
00:13:18,736 --> 00:13:20,369
Your castle's
pretty well-defended.

323
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:21,437
Level six catapults.

324
00:13:21,472 --> 00:13:23,038
Level seven sorcerers.

325
00:13:23,074 --> 00:13:24,907
Maxed-out trolls.
(whistles)

326
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:27,476
Uh, yeah, well.
(clears his throat)

327
00:13:27,512 --> 00:13:29,378
Yeah, gets the job done.

328
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:32,214
I tell you, those are
some nice upgrades.

329
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,083
Expensive upgrades.

330
00:13:34,118 --> 00:13:36,552
Upgrades like
that cost gems.

331
00:13:36,587 --> 00:13:38,621
And gems cost cash.

332
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:40,623
Expensive cash.

333
00:13:40,658 --> 00:13:42,091
Where'd you get
the cash, Nelson?

334
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:43,292
I don't use gems!

335
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:45,661
I'm a grinder!
A grinder!

336
00:13:45,696 --> 00:13:47,162
(grunts)

337
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:49,331
(yelling)

338
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:51,066
(both moaning)

339
00:13:51,102 --> 00:13:53,102
(moaning continues)

340
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,743
(gasps)

341
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:01,944
(whimpering)

342
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:03,646
(both scream)

343
00:14:03,681 --> 00:14:05,614
What are they?

344
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,616
They're like televisions...

345
00:14:07,652 --> 00:14:09,919
but they just keep going!

346
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:11,754
He's meeting
with someone.

347
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:13,822
That's always
a sign of guilt.

348
00:14:19,063 --> 00:14:20,095
Hope you don't mind.

349
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:21,430
I cooked some dinner on it.

350
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:25,167
Mmm. (sniffs)

351
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:28,003
Ah, smell you later.

352
00:14:30,408 --> 00:14:32,908
("Take the A Train" by Duke
Ellington ringtone plays)

353
00:14:32,944 --> 00:14:34,310
(phone beeps)

354
00:14:34,345 --> 00:14:36,845
This is our chance.

355
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:38,814
BOTH:
Hot! Hot!

356
00:14:38,849 --> 00:14:40,316
Hot!

357
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:41,850
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

358
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:43,385
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

359
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:44,620
(gasps)

360
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,157
(tires squealing)

361
00:14:48,192 --> 00:14:49,858
(crickets chirping)

362
00:14:49,894 --> 00:14:51,894
(groans)

363
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:52,962
(both groan)

364
00:14:52,997 --> 00:14:54,863
The universe
does hate us.

365
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,166
It feels good
to surrender.

366
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:59,001
(all groan)

367
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:00,636
Good girl, Maggie.

368
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:02,638
Give up young.

369
00:15:02,673 --> 00:15:05,140
(panting, barking)

370
00:15:08,396 --> 00:15:10,029
(all groaning)

371
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:11,730
Get up off that floor!

372
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,732
We are on
a head-to-head cook-off

373
00:15:13,768 --> 00:15:17,269
that'll be shown on TV
and probably some planes.

374
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:19,304
We don't have the smoker.

375
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,774
Just let us forfeit
with dignity.

376
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:23,409
We still have to try.

377
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:25,944
This isn't a family of quitters.

378
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,212
Sure we are.

379
00:15:27,248 --> 00:15:29,548
We always have been
and more so now.

380
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,250
I'm a quitter.

381
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:32,751
And I'll back down to anyone
who says I'm not.

382
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:35,454
Come on,
Buddhists aren't quitters.

383
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:37,122
Actually, Mom,
Buddhism is really

384
00:15:37,158 --> 00:15:39,224
just quitting in yoga pants.

385
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,061
This is a Live Strong bracelet.

386
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:43,796
Lance Armstrong
never quit.

387
00:15:43,831 --> 00:15:45,464
He never quit
the Tour de France.

388
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:48,400
He never quit lying
about his steroid use.

389
00:15:48,436 --> 00:15:50,269
And he still hasn't
totally come clean.

390
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:52,738
Now get in the car!

391
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:54,039
(lively chatter)

392
00:15:54,075 --> 00:15:57,176
MOE: Eat-down! Eat-down! Eat-down!
Yee-haw!

393
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:01,346
I can handle this
barbeque competition.

394
00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:04,983
All I need is a little
help from an old friend.

395
00:16:07,388 --> 00:16:08,687
I'm Alton Brown

396
00:16:08,723 --> 00:16:10,823
and welcome to<i> Eat-down!</i>

397
00:16:10,858 --> 00:16:13,792
Today Scotty Boom
takes on the Simpsons in...

398
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:16,261
(bell clanging)

399
00:16:16,297 --> 00:16:18,497
And I can tell you this--
it will be edited

400
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:20,999
to be dramatic.

401
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:22,801
Marge, do you
think your meat

402
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:25,037
has what it takes
to win this Eat-down?

403
00:16:25,072 --> 00:16:26,705
It sure does.

404
00:16:26,741 --> 00:16:28,440
Homer, what about you?

405
00:16:28,476 --> 00:16:29,808
No way in hell.

406
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:31,343
What about you kids?

407
00:16:31,378 --> 00:16:33,011
Are you pumped up
to beat Scotty Boom?

408
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:34,646
Happiness is an illusion.

409
00:16:34,682 --> 00:16:37,116
What she said.

410
00:16:37,151 --> 00:16:38,317
Looks like the Simpsons
are playing

411
00:16:38,352 --> 00:16:40,119
mind games with you,
Scotty.

412
00:16:40,154 --> 00:16:41,987
Are you feeling
the pressure?

413
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:43,322
No pressure.

414
00:16:43,357 --> 00:16:45,524
I'm throwing down
the taste of New York.

415
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:48,994
My recipe's infused with
Times Square, the Bronx Zoo

416
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:51,230
and the<i> Sex and the City</i>
walking tour.

417
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:53,065
The Simpsons better
bring their A game.

418
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,167
HOMER:
F! F game!

419
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,972
I call this my
Never-Give-Up Brisket.

420
00:17:00,007 --> 00:17:03,809
The secret ingredient
is hope.

421
00:17:03,844 --> 00:17:05,844
Mm?

422
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,045
(spits)

423
00:17:07,081 --> 00:17:09,248
How many spices
did you put in this?

424
00:17:09,283 --> 00:17:10,749
All of them.

425
00:17:10,785 --> 00:17:12,785
(all groaning)

426
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:17,189
(audience oohing)

427
00:17:17,224 --> 00:17:20,726
I've never seen such
unusual grill marks.

428
00:17:20,761 --> 00:17:24,029
This pattern looks
like a honeycomb.

429
00:17:24,064 --> 00:17:25,330
What?

430
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:27,533
That meat was cooked
on the Hive!

431
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:30,869
This garlic-sucking tunnel trash
stole our smoker!

432
00:17:30,905 --> 00:17:32,604
Ah, this little
flyover's crazy.

433
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,375
I cooked that meat myself
right here over here.

434
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:40,746
The grill marks don't match.

435
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:43,282
Dead meat doesn't lie.

436
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:44,883
(audience gasping)

437
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:46,118
(gasping)

438
00:17:46,153 --> 00:17:48,287
Scotty Boom, you are
hereby banned

439
00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:49,922
from the Chew Network.

440
00:17:49,957 --> 00:17:52,524
You are no longer
a celebrity chef.

441
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,359
You're just a chef.

442
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:55,594
Take him away, Chief.

443
00:17:55,629 --> 00:17:57,596
Grand theft smoker.

444
00:17:57,631 --> 00:17:59,097
Sounds like a crime to me.

445
00:18:03,003 --> 00:18:04,903
Apparently,
the winner of the Eat-down

446
00:18:04,939 --> 00:18:06,905
is the Simpsons.

447
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:08,774
(cheering)

448
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:10,475
Isn't this a
little too easy?

449
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:13,111
Why would a professional
chef cheat?

450
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:15,113
And how does Nelson fit in?

451
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:17,482
And where the heck
is our smoker?

452
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:20,485
("Take the A Train" by Duke
Ellington ringtone plays)

453
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:21,954
(phone beeps)

454
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:25,324
That's the ringtone
from the scrapyard!

455
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:26,658
LISA:
Get him!

456
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:32,431
Bones! Bones!

457
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:34,266
I'm covered in death!

458
00:18:34,301 --> 00:18:35,500
(gasps)

459
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:39,504
My hoops!

460
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,973
Dad, stop him!

461
00:18:41,008 --> 00:18:42,841
I'm done trying.

462
00:18:42,877 --> 00:18:44,810
Dad, please!
No one's asking you to care.

463
00:18:44,845 --> 00:18:46,778
Just trip a stranger!

464
00:18:46,814 --> 00:18:48,814
(grumbles)

465
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,358
A kid?

466
00:18:59,393 --> 00:19:01,026
Why'd you steal
our smoker?

467
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:02,794
Why'd you frame
Scotty Boom?

468
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,963
'Cause he's my dad.

469
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:07,366
I'm Tyler Boom.
Huh?

470
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:10,535
My dad is so busy
shooting his TV shows

471
00:19:10,571 --> 00:19:12,537
and going to the openings
and closings

472
00:19:12,573 --> 00:19:14,539
of his restaurants...

473
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:16,275
I never see him.

474
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,976
You destroyed
your Dad's career

475
00:19:18,012 --> 00:19:20,345
so he'd spend
more time with you?

476
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:22,180
Aw...

477
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:23,582
I met this kid Nelson

478
00:19:23,617 --> 00:19:25,717
<i>playing</i> Clash of Castles
<i>online.</i>

479
00:19:25,753 --> 00:19:28,353
<i>You know, I knew my dad</i>
<i>was coming to your town,</i>

480
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:31,223
<i>so I hired Nelson</i>
<i>to take your smoker.</i>

481
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:33,692
<i>And then my nanny</i>
<i>cooked some meat on it</i>

482
00:19:33,727 --> 00:19:37,296
<i>and switched it so it looked</i>
<i>like my dad cheated.</i>

483
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:39,631
This was the only way.

484
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:42,167
The only way
I thought of.

485
00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:45,037
Son, why didn't you tell me
I was a terrible father?

486
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:46,505
Because I'm from New York.

487
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,073
We don't talk about
our feelings, huh?

488
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:49,675
Yeah, I understand, son.

489
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,176
I'm from New York, too.

490
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:52,544
FDR Drive.

491
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:54,746
The West Side Highway.

492
00:19:54,782 --> 00:19:56,014
Investment banking.

493
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,716
The gallery scene.

494
00:19:57,751 --> 00:19:59,017
Knicks suck.

495
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:00,719
(crying):
Oh, Papa!

496
00:20:00,754 --> 00:20:02,554
They suck so hard!

497
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:04,022
One more thing, Tyler.

498
00:20:04,058 --> 00:20:05,891
Where's the Hive?

499
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:07,292
(gasping)

500
00:20:08,495 --> 00:20:10,362
Oh...

501
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,866
(sizzling)

502
00:20:14,902 --> 00:20:17,836
You're always so much hotter
than I think you're gonna be.

503
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:21,206
Thanks, guys, for not giving up,
then giving up,

504
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:25,777
then not giving up again,
then I forget.

505
00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:27,546
BBQ is like family--

506
00:20:27,581 --> 00:20:30,248
the cheap cuts of meat
that nobody wants.

507
00:20:30,284 --> 00:20:31,583
But if you treat them right,

508
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:34,486
they turn into
the best thing in the world.

509
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:36,655
Yeah, barbecue's yummy.

510
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,857
Chinese is pretty good, too.

511
00:20:38,892 --> 00:20:40,325
Meh, it depends
on the place.
