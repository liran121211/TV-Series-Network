at the hotel.

not seem like it now,

when you grow up.

like her better than me.

00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:20,107
And maybe we could
start with a hug?

365
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:24,411
Aw, I'm so glad
we're sharing this.

366
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:26,880
And I'm glad I have
one kid who's never

367
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,450
gonna go anywhere
or do anything.

368
00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:30,517
Damn it, Homer!

369
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:32,987
You ruin everything!

370
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:34,588
(groans)

371
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,630
Grampa, got to talk to Grampa.

372
00:13:49,138 --> 00:13:51,672
Grampa, I sure miss you, man.

373
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:55,209
What would you say
if you were here right now?

374
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:58,479
If you ever get a chance to
pitch woo at Myrna Loy, take it!

375
00:13:58,514 --> 00:14:01,248
She has eyes
like a Persian cat.

376
00:14:01,284 --> 00:14:03,584
Of course in my day,
Persia extended

377
00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:06,020
from Algiers
to Constantinople.

378
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:09,790
Till the revolt
of the eunuchs in 1916 when...

379
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:12,826
(shouts)
Ooh, you got gumption, kid.

380
00:14:12,862 --> 00:14:16,096
Find what you love
and follow it to glory.

381
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:18,132
Yes.

382
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,202
ANNOUNCER: So, we're headed
into the final round

383
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:25,339
of the Duff Extreme BMX
vert competition.

384
00:14:25,374 --> 00:14:27,141
Let's check the scoreboard

385
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:31,312
while the half-pipe is being
cleaned by the Blood-Zoni.

386
00:14:31,347 --> 00:14:32,980
Dad, one more
round and I win!

387
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:35,349
First achievement
I can call my own.

388
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:37,251
Thank God whatever
this thing is

389
00:14:37,286 --> 00:14:39,386
is considered a sport.

390
00:14:39,422 --> 00:14:42,222
ANNOUNCER: Bart Simpson
to the gate, please.

391
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:44,325
Oh, good, we're just in time.

392
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,693
Hmm.

393
00:14:45,728 --> 00:14:47,628
It's not the size
of the pennant.

394
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:51,265
It's what you do with it.

395
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,534
All right, nobody
likes a showoff.

396
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:54,902
D'oh!

397
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,106
(crowd cheering)

398
00:14:59,141 --> 00:15:00,341
ANNOUNCER:
Oh, man, I love to see this.

399
00:15:00,376 --> 00:15:01,909
Simpson's setting up
for his signature

400
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,878
suicide no-hander
540 crank-flip!

401
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,494
(gulps)

402
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:22,162
BART:<i> I'm doing it!</i>
<i>I'm doing it!</i>

403
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:23,564
<i>Finally, I'm me.</i>

404
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:26,400
<i>Finally out of Lisa's shadow.</i>

405
00:15:28,204 --> 00:15:30,471
No!
(grunts)

406
00:15:30,506 --> 00:15:32,906
(grunting)

407
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:34,875
Yes! Yes!

408
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,477
Thank God I aced
chest compressions

409
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:39,113
at Mayo pre-med camp!

410
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,647
And Bart's okay!

411
00:15:40,683 --> 00:15:43,117
The real star of this
BMX tournament is

412
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:44,551
Lisa Simpson!

413
00:15:44,587 --> 00:15:46,720
CROWD (chanting):
Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!

414
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:49,289
You've ruined everything
I've ever done!

415
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:51,225
Move, quick!

416
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,493
No!

417
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:54,228
Warned you.

418
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:00,812
Biker, huh?
I used to bike.

419
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:02,680
I used to have dreams.

420
00:16:02,716 --> 00:16:04,816
I used to think disco
was coming back.

421
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:06,851
Now I'm just Stu.

422
00:16:06,886 --> 00:16:08,986
Nothing Stu.

423
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:12,724
Hey, Bart, you are coming
to my graduation party tonight?

424
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,559
I don't know, man.
It's humiliating.

425
00:16:14,594 --> 00:16:17,795
My little sister's graduating
the same year as me.

426
00:16:17,831 --> 00:16:19,797
Haw-haw!

427
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,700
Nelson, how can you say that
with what's happened to you?

428
00:16:22,736 --> 00:16:25,937
Yeah, well, I bought
a totally bitching car

429
00:16:25,972 --> 00:16:29,741
with the money I got
selling my pituitary gland.

430
00:16:29,776 --> 00:16:32,710
So cool.

431
00:16:32,746 --> 00:16:34,746
(rock music playing)

432
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:44,088
(crying): I knew I'd break down
when Kearney Jr. graduated.

433
00:16:44,124 --> 00:16:45,323
It's okay, Dad.

434
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:47,458
We still got K-3.

435
00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:48,459
(coos)

436
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:50,328
(both laughing)

437
00:16:50,363 --> 00:16:51,329
Right.

438
00:16:51,364 --> 00:16:53,297
Ralph, you joined the army?

439
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:57,401
Yes, because I needed
a costume for this party.

440
00:16:57,437 --> 00:16:59,904
At college I'm gonna
reinvent myself.

441
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:02,640
I'll pretend I have
a girlfriend in Canada.

442
00:17:02,675 --> 00:17:06,477
I'll say she lives in Alberta
and her name is Alberta,

443
00:17:06,513 --> 00:17:10,381
so I don't have
to remember two lies.

444
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,983
Bart!

445
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:13,417
I was getting worried.

446
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:14,852
I'm your oldest buddy.

447
00:17:14,888 --> 00:17:16,320
I was there when you
got your nose done,

448
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:18,990
then I was there when you
had your nose undone.

449
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:22,226
Friends, family, and
a few people we hired

450
00:17:22,262 --> 00:17:24,662
to make our son
look more popular...

451
00:17:24,697 --> 00:17:26,430
I love Milton!

452
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:28,199
Dad, you're embarrassing me!

453
00:17:28,234 --> 00:17:30,434
As usual.

454
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,104
Yes, it's the only thing
your father does well.

455
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:37,008
Can't you two put it aside
for one night in honor of me?

456
00:17:37,043 --> 00:17:38,509
No!
No!

457
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:40,711
Oh.

458
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:42,046
Ah, what the heck?

459
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:44,215
Congratulations, Milhouse.

460
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,152
You made it through adolescence
and you're cuter than ever.

461
00:17:48,188 --> 00:17:50,421
Oh, sweet Lisa!

462
00:17:50,456 --> 00:17:52,290
You know I had
a rocky childhood

463
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:54,125
with all the rocks
they threw at me.

464
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,662
You're the most amazing
thing at this party.

465
00:17:57,697 --> 00:17:59,697
Well, excuse me!

466
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,300
(groans)

467
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:04,602
I'm not even the best Simpson
at my best friend's party!

468
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:07,738
Do you know what it's like to
be second-best at anything?

469
00:18:07,774 --> 00:18:09,006
Yeah, I do!

470
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:10,408
I'm going to Yale!

471
00:18:10,443 --> 00:18:12,109
Listen here, Bart Simpson!

472
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:13,911
I am sick and tired
of you blaming me

473
00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:16,247
for every setback
you have ever had!

474
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:18,616
And you have talents, too,
you idiot.

475
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:20,318
You're a hell of an artist,

476
00:18:20,353 --> 00:18:22,253
even though you don't
do anything with it.

477
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:25,022
You think I'm an artist?

478
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:28,226
And you already have a true
artist's most important asset.

479
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:30,428
A miserable life.

480
00:18:30,463 --> 00:18:33,598
So if that's all my fault,
you're welcome.

481
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,920
Hey, man.

482
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:57,521
You're looking good.

483
00:18:57,557 --> 00:18:59,991
Thank God Lisa invented
the artificial pituitary.

484
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:02,326
Sorry, didn't mean
to use the "L" word.

485
00:19:02,362 --> 00:19:05,329
Listen, man,
a certain someone convinced me

486
00:19:05,365 --> 00:19:08,099
to go around giving back
the lunch money I took.

487
00:19:08,134 --> 00:19:10,468
Here's the first $5,000.

488
00:19:10,503 --> 00:19:11,569
Wow.

489
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:13,571
Thanks.
What got into you?

490
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:15,106
Nelson, come on!

491
00:19:15,141 --> 00:19:18,309
We'll miss day six
of the Bolivian Film Festival.

492
00:19:18,344 --> 00:19:19,877
You guys are dating?

493
00:19:19,913 --> 00:19:21,345
Is there any other reason
I'd be going

494
00:19:21,381 --> 00:19:23,314
to a Bolivian Film Festival?

495
00:19:23,349 --> 00:19:24,815
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you, Bart.

496
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:27,585
I don't really know
how you feel about me.

497
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,288
Well, you told me I was
an artist, and you were right.

498
00:19:30,323 --> 00:19:32,590
I am, and

499
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,959
I get to write on the walls.

500
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:37,495
LISA:
Wow, that's beautiful.

501
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,997
I do notice
there's no me.

502
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:41,832
Ah, those are the breaks.

503
00:19:41,868 --> 00:19:44,201
Why don't I buy you and your
boyfriend a couple beers?

504
00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:45,336
Just let me close up.

505
00:19:45,371 --> 00:19:46,671
That would be nice.

506
00:19:46,706 --> 00:19:49,106
We'll see you at the car.

507
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,444
Aw!

508
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:55,346
You weren't supposed to see.

509
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:57,381
Well, I'm glad I did.

510
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:01,752
Hmm?

511
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:03,587
You're El Barto?

512
00:20:03,623 --> 00:20:05,623
How is that possible?

513
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:17,916
Why are clouds brown?

514
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,083
Pollution.

515
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,852
Why is the grass green?

516
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,920
'Cause it's artificial.

517
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:25,723
Then why are
the sprinklers coming on?

518
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:28,426
'Cause I was too
lazy to unhook them.

519
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,828
Why aren't we moving?

520
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:33,564
Because you're drunk
and I'm stoned.

521
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,400
Why does beer
taste so good?

522
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,970
'Cause you've
just had seven.

523
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,705
BART:
<i>Did you like the movie</i> Boyhood?

524
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,406
HOMER:
<i>Oh, is that what this was?</i>

525
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:45,076
BART:<i> How many years</i>
<i>of hair do I have left?</i>

526
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:48,045
HOMER:<i> It disappears as soon</i>
<i>as girls like you.</i>

527
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,014
BART:
<i>What's the secret of life?</i>

528
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:53,117
HOMER:<i> You can avoid</i>
<i>a lot of awkward situations</i>

529
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:55,086
<i>by pretending</i>
<i>to be on the phone.</i>

530
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,154
BART:
<i>Like what?</i>

531
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:58,256
HOMER:<i> Hold on,</i>
<i>I got to take this call.</i>
