a couple of years ago,

through crowdfunding.

the crowdfunding video
you costarred in

168
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:08,481

175
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,723

Oh. Oh.

Marge, do you know
what it's like

364
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:46,783
to have a man take care
of your every need?

365
00:13:46,818 --> 00:13:49,886
I've thought about it a lot,
but no.

366
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:51,121
How come you're so quiet?

367
00:13:51,155 --> 00:13:52,856
Did he switch your brain
with a rabbit's?

368
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,592
'Cause that means somewhere
there is one annoying rabbit.

369
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,094
Shut up.

370
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,863

the way Harper cut me off.

371
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:01,598
It's kind of weird.

372
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,167
Yeah, that was

Wow, a whole week.

Look, Harper, this may be
crappy, but it's my bike.

538
00:21:04,705 --> 00:21:06,471
Good-bye, sweet liquors

539
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:09,274
that didn't let Marge
know I was drunk.

540
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,442
Good-bye, snorkeling

541
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,277
and Jet-Skiing

542
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,447
and other things I never tried.

543
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,982
Good-bye, obese natives

544
00:21:17,017 --> 00:21:19,217
that made me feel fit.

545
00:21:19,253 --> 00:21:21,853
Good-bye, Bart. Bart?!

546
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:23,889
(laughing)

547
00:21:25,068 --> 00:21:27,001
Shh!
