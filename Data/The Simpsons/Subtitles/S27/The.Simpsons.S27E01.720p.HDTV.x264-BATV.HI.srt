00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:33,046
(soft groaning, snoring)
Huh?

19
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:35,315
Where's the snooze button?

20
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,716
Ah, that's better.

21
00:00:38,453 --> 00:00:40,520
Hey, what?
I gotta get out of here!

(alarm blaring)
It's... (yawns)

23
00:00:42,123 --> 00:00:43,690
After just five more minutes.

24
00:00:43,725 --> 00:00:45,091

00:00:45,126 --> 00:00:47,560

Oh... Marge...

27
00:00:52,934 --> 00:00:56,002
On a Tuesday?

28
00:00:56,037 --> 00:00:57,870
DR. HIBBERT:
<i>Yet again,</i>

29
00:00:57,906 --> 00:00:59,205
Homer will be fine.

30
00:01:01,343 --> 00:01:03,977
Mm. He's been sleeping
an awful lot.

31
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:06,279
Look at these
vacation photos.

32
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:08,114
DR. HIBBERT: Oh, my!

33
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:09,882
(chuckling)

34
00:01:09,918 --> 00:01:12,585
Man, you people sure
take a lot of vacations.

35
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,088
MARGE: That's just to remind me
where I parked.

36
00:01:15,123 --> 00:01:18,558
Hmm. I think I have an idea
of what might be going on.

37
00:01:18,593 --> 00:01:20,059
(gasps)
Huh? What?

38
00:01:20,095 --> 00:01:22,161
First, you're gonna
need a spinal tap.

39
00:01:22,197 --> 00:01:24,263
Please be the band.
Please be the band.

40
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,665
Oh!

41
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,167
Aren't you supposed
to give him anesthetic?

42
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:30,436
Oh, I knew I forgot something.

43
00:01:30,472 --> 00:01:32,338
(screaming): Ow!

44
00:01:36,678 --> 00:01:37,744
(printer whirring)

45
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:41,414
Oof. Very low levels
of hypocretin.

46
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:44,017
I'm afraid Homer has...
narcolepsy.

47
00:01:44,052 --> 00:01:46,686
Doctor, is it time
to pull the plug on my father?

48
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:49,155
No, wait. I'll spare you
that painful decision.

49
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,690
HOMER: No, Bart!
That's the TV!

50
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:52,325
Ha-ha!
That's the other guy.

51
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,326
Stop that!

52
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:54,494
(laughs)

53
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:56,662
Narcolepsy's merely
sleeping sickness,

54
00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:58,598
and many narcoleptics
do lead normal lives

55
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:00,633
by avoiding
stressful triggers

56
00:02:00,668 --> 00:02:03,136
like, uh, oh, let's say...

57
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:04,837
Helping with the laundry?
Exactly.

58
00:02:04,873 --> 00:02:06,773
Having to pay my doctor's bill?

59
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:08,274
Don't play with me, man.

60
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:10,209
I will mess you up.

61
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:13,546
Here's a signed certification
of your condition.

62
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:15,481
This is a bona fide
medical excuse

63
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:17,717
from doing anything
you find taxing.

64
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:19,318
But you only use that

65
00:02:19,354 --> 00:02:22,055
when absolutely necessary,
right, Homie?

66
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,556
Marge, please!

67
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:25,458
I'll probably<i> never</i> use it.

68
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:27,593
Dad, can you drive me
to Milhouse's?

69
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:28,629
Narcolepsy.

70
00:02:28,663 --> 00:02:30,396
There's a spider
in my room!

71
00:02:30,432 --> 00:02:31,664
Narcolepsy.

72
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,966
Dr. Hibbert called in a
prescription for you to pick up.

73
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:34,967
Narcolepsy.

74
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:36,803
Yes,<i> for</i> narcolepsy,

75
00:02:36,838 --> 00:02:38,538
which you should get now.

76
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:40,673
You can't spend
half your life napping.

77
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,909
Maggie does, and you
think she's adorable.

78
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:46,145
Yes, because babies
are always cute.

79
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:48,181
(snoring)

80
00:02:49,384 --> 00:02:50,716
(coughing)

81
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,820
(sniffs) Oh, that baby
needs a diaper change.

82
00:02:53,855 --> 00:02:55,888
Nar-co-lep-sy.

83
00:02:55,924 --> 00:02:57,190
(groans)

84
00:02:57,225 --> 00:02:59,392
Homie, you have no idea
what it's like

85
00:02:59,427 --> 00:03:01,060
being married to you.

86
00:03:01,096 --> 00:03:04,530
Me being married to me, eh?

87
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,700
("Bridal Chorus" playing)

88
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:09,869
HOMER:
Stop the wedding!

89
00:03:09,904 --> 00:03:11,504
What about our child?

90
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:12,939
(baby whimpers)

91
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:13,940
(dog barks)

92
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:15,374
Don't forget me.

93
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,077
Now I've seen everything.

94
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:21,814
A window that talks?!

95
00:03:23,785 --> 00:03:26,719
Okay, can you explain again
how I take this medication?

96
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:28,187
One a day with food.

97
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:30,756
Yeah, but what kind
of food, girly?

98
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:33,192
Stuffed cabbage,
a nice bowl of soup?

99
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:36,429
(sighs) Any idea
when you'll get to me?

100
00:03:36,464 --> 00:03:38,197
Well, there's four
old people ahead of you,

101
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:39,932
so how's Thursday at 1:00?

102
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:42,301
Oh, you know it's funny
that you should say one,

103
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:45,037
'cause that's how many
grandchildren that I have.

104
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:46,539
I'm gonna have grandchildren

105
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:48,674
by the time I get
through this line.

106
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,876
Oh, that's so nice.
Isn't that interesting?

107
00:03:49,911 --> 00:03:51,144
Oh, well,
congratulations.

108
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:52,378
(giggles)

109
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:54,580
Narcolepsy, take me away!

110
00:03:54,616 --> 00:03:56,082
Oh! (grunts)

111
00:03:57,085 --> 00:03:58,384
(groans)
(toy squeaks)

112
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,389
(sniffing)

113
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:04,891
I smell beer.

114
00:04:04,926 --> 00:04:06,225
Did you go to Moe's?

115
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:08,561
Every time I have beer
on my breath,

116
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:10,229
you assume I've been drinking.

117
00:04:10,265 --> 00:04:12,465
(groans loudly)

118
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,100
Oh, that's a long one.

119
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:16,002
Did you at least get
the medicine?

120
00:04:16,037 --> 00:04:18,504
I tried, and I failed.
Miserably.

121
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,140
But I'm willing to work
this out in counseling.

122
00:04:21,176 --> 00:04:23,009
(groans) We've been
to every counselor

123
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:25,344
from Avery to Zabinsky.

124
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,946
But not Zilowitz.

125
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:29,749
HOMER:<i> And that's why</i>
<i>there'll never be</i>

126
00:04:29,784 --> 00:04:32,752
another golfer as good
as Chi-Chi Rodríguez.

127
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:35,855
The name and the game,
he had it all.

128
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,791
Okay, I think we got
a little off-track here.

129
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:40,593
I know this marriage
isn't perfect,

130
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:43,963
or even great,
but now I treasure the moments

131
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:45,498
where it's just so-so.

132
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:48,100
(snoring)
I'd kill for "okay."

133
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:50,937
Please, please,
just tell me what to do.

134
00:04:50,972 --> 00:04:52,438
I've never said this--

135
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:54,307
and I don't even know
if I'm supposed to say this--

136
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:57,543
but this marriage is rotting
with the stench of death.

137
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:00,479
Oh, that seems a little strong.

138
00:05:00,515 --> 00:05:03,182
How about reeking like
a trashcan in a dog park?

139
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:06,052
Does my marriage have to be
something you can smell?

140
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:08,287
(snoring)

141
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:10,323
You see, Marge? You see?

142
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:12,892
The only way you and Homer
will ever be happy

143
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:14,827
is to spend a little time apart,

144
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:16,729
followed by more time apart,

145
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:18,364
followed by a divorce.

146
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,966
What?!

147
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:21,500
What is... What,
what's going on?

148
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:22,902
Wait, no, no, no,
I remember.

149
00:05:22,937 --> 00:05:24,904
Happy anniversary.

150
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:26,539
Homer, Homer, listen to me.

151
00:05:26,574 --> 00:05:28,507
There's just so much
I can take.

152
00:05:28,543 --> 00:05:30,209
No, we can save this.

153
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:31,644
We'll go to a therapist.

154
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:33,079
We're<i> at</i> a therapist!

155
00:05:33,114 --> 00:05:34,914
How you doin'?

156
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:37,850
What's going on here?

157
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:39,919
(sobbing)

158
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:41,220
Nothing.

159
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:42,421
Everything's fine.

160
00:05:42,457 --> 00:05:43,990
See? (sobbing continues)

161
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:46,659
I'll love you forever.

162
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:48,594
Kids, a professional felt

163
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,329
the best way
for your father and me

164
00:05:50,365 --> 00:05:52,098
to work on our relationship

165
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:53,699
was to give up on it.

166
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:56,068
But after a while,
Dad's coming back?

167
00:05:56,104 --> 00:05:57,104
Oh, yeah, of course.

168
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:58,704
Maybe not.

169
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,273
Oh, Marge,

170
00:06:00,308 --> 00:06:02,375
after all my divorce-worthy
statements and actions,

171
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,010
many of which
you don't know about,

172
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:06,946
how can you kick me out
now that I'm sick?

173
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:09,382
Narcolepsy is a serious thing.

174
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:13,085
Maybe because you didn't take it
seriously enough.

175
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:18,057
I pity you!

176
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,460
(Homer sobbing)

177
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:22,728
(Homer wailing)

178
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:25,031
(crying):
Why is Daddy going away?

179
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:26,766

00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:05,326
Yes, but no.

360
00:14:05,362 --> 00:14:07,242
Is he your guest
at a dinner for schmucks?

361
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:07,864
No.

362
00:14:07,864 --> 00:14:10,365
(gasps) Are you a
Humpty Dumpty catcher?

363
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,733
Be honest.

364
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,201
All no.

365
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:15,570
Does her remind you
of a childhood snowman?

366
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,839
Yes, that's it!

367
00:14:17,874 --> 00:14:20,441
And the great thing is
he will never melt.

368
00:14:20,477 --> 00:14:23,711
Man, I would love to get back
into snowman shape.

369
00:14:23,747 --> 00:14:25,980
I can't even fit
in my scarf anymore.

370
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:29,083
Whoa, this is serious.

371
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,952
Complimentary tattoos.

372
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:33,888
Yeah, I've always been looking
for the very special lady

373
00:14:33,923 --> 00:14:35,556
who would match up with this.

374
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,092
(whinnying)

375
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,193
All right, very funny.

376
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:40,461
You two celebrating or what?

377
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:42,230
Two Scorpinos, Moe.

378
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:43,731
Scorpinos, you got it.

379
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:45,566
And those are served in, uh...

380
00:14:45,602 --> 00:14:46,934
Champagne flute.

381
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,469
Champagne flute, got it.

382
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:50,304
And that is a...

383
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,241
Glass! A clean glass.

384
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:55,643
Ah, coming right up there,
Your Highness.

385
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,644
Nut case.

386
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,680
(engine revs, tires squeal)

387
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:05,319
Wow, Homer,
you really stuck the landing

388
00:15:05,355 --> 00:15:06,888
after your separation.

389
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:09,057
Yeah, it's great.

390
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:11,292
Except her friends
are always over.

391
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:15,596
I've been there for three weeks,
and I can't find the TV.

392
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:17,131
And no one has any problems,

393
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,100
except they talk
about them endlessly.

394
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:20,735
Kind of like
you're doing now?

395
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,904
And the weirdest
thing of all is

396
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:24,972
now she wants me
to meet her dad.

397
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,841
Wow, who pays for that dinner?

398
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:28,676
I plan to pretend
there's a bug in my food

399
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:30,111
and get the meal for free.

400
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:31,279
Smooth.

401
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:33,948
H-Hello, sir.

402
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:36,017
Thank you for inviting me
to dinner, sir.

403
00:15:36,052 --> 00:15:37,485
Homer, relax.

404
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,120
I have no problem
with the age difference

405
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:40,922
between you and my daughter.

406
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:43,524
In fact, I've been dating a
much younger woman myself.

407
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,359
Oh, here she comes now.

408
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:47,595
(humming happily)

409
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,163
(gasping)

410
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,834
Okay, okay,
we can be adults about this.

411
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,869
Waiter, champagne?

412
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,574
(sputtering)

413
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:03,892
So I can't date
an older man,

414
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:06,332
but your girlfriend can?

415
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:08,434
She's not my girlfriend.

416
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:10,836
Candice and I don't use labels.

417
00:16:10,872 --> 00:16:13,940
Mm, doesn't look like she uses
that much shampoo, either.

418
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:15,274
Lay off my girlfriend!

419
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,543
Roger is great
with the kids.

420
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:19,278
He even taught
Bart how to bunt.

421
00:16:19,314 --> 00:16:21,213
Oh, so now you're super dad?

422
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:23,115
When I was a kid,
you were never around.

423
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:24,517
You missed
my high school play.

424
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:26,552
You told me not to come.

425
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:28,487
You're supposed
to fight me on that!

426
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:29,689
Well, Marge,

427
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:32,224
your Roger's
not so perfect now.

428
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,828
He's got a screwed up daughter
with a pathetic boyfriend.

429
00:16:35,863 --> 00:16:37,797
Candice, dear, I apologize.

430
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:40,366
I'm trying so hard
to set my life right.

431
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:42,301
Oh, speaking of which.

432
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:44,637
Marge, I am going to do
something I should've done

433
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:46,339
three weeks ago
when I met you.

434
00:16:46,374 --> 00:16:47,807
Will you marry me, Marge?

435
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:48,874
Yes.

436
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,043
As soon as my divorce is final.

437
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:53,479
Then you can put a ring
on my finger, Homer.

438
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:54,981
I'm already pregnant.

439
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:56,182
You're pregnant?!

440
00:16:56,217 --> 00:16:57,984
But I kept my shirt on!

441
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,852
(echoing):
No!

442
00:17:00,955 --> 00:17:02,188
(snoring)

443
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:04,090
Huh?
What am I doing here?

444
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,592
Sleeping through
our therapy session.

445
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:09,762
Dreaming only about you.

446
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:11,197
So none of it happened?

447
00:17:11,232 --> 00:17:12,398
We're still together?

448
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:14,433
Somehow.
Whoo-hoo!

449
00:17:14,469 --> 00:17:17,603
And you thought our only
option was to break up.

450
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:19,171
I never said that.

451
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,073
If I told people
that didn't belong together

452
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:24,010
they shouldn't be together,
I'd be out of a job.

453
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:26,078
Huh, I must have
dreamed that, too.

454
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:29,081
Okay, why don't you tell us more
about this dream?

455
00:17:29,117 --> 00:17:30,950
All you need to know
about my dream

456
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:34,453
is that Marge and I have been
completely turned around by it,

457
00:17:34,489 --> 00:17:36,288
and like Scrooge,
I will demonstrate

458
00:17:36,324 --> 00:17:38,024
I have learned my lesson

459
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:39,725
by making a boy run to the store

460
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:41,560
and buy me a goose.

461
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:44,363
I think you're going to have
to do a little more, Homer.

462
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:46,866
Oh, I'll do a lot more
than a little more!

463
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:48,968
I'll do some.

464
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:50,936
If you could just be good
for a month,

465
00:17:50,972 --> 00:17:52,972
that would really
show me something.

466
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:54,573
Absolutely.

467
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:56,442
Can the month be February?

468
00:17:56,477 --> 00:17:57,610
Okay, March.

469
00:17:57,645 --> 00:17:58,811
(groans)

470
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:02,048
You did it, Homie!

471
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,116
And what a March it was.

472
00:18:04,152 --> 00:18:05,618
A beautiful Easter,

473
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:07,820
a sober St. Patrick's Day,

474
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:09,588
and impeccable behavior

475
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:12,691
watching the NCAA
basketball tournament.

476
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:14,460
Mm-hmm!

477
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:15,928
And with your love, Dad,

478
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:18,297
I'm eating meat
and Maggie's talking.

479
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,302
♪ I see trees of green ♪

480
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:25,838
♪ Red roses, too... ♪

481
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:27,773

482
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,775
MALE SINGER (rock beat):

483
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:31,844

484
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:33,612

485
00:18:33,648 --> 00:18:35,681
Aah! Huh? Huh? Huh?

486
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:38,084
I got you one of those beers
you enjoy unironically.

487
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:41,153
This won
a blue ribbon in 1890?

488
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:42,655
What does that mean?

489
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,757
Wait, so this is reality?

490
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,525
That other dream
was just a dream?

491
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:50,463
Noooooooo!

492
00:18:50,498 --> 00:18:52,665
But you forgot to pay!

493
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,034
(distant):
Oh!

494
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:56,069
(whimpering)

495
00:18:58,106 --> 00:18:59,106
(gasps)

496
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,709
(sobbing)

497
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:05,811
I've lost everything.

498
00:19:05,847 --> 00:19:08,280
My wife, my family...

499
00:19:08,316 --> 00:19:09,316
(sobbing)

500
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,117
You didn't lose me, Dad.

501
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:12,852
(chuckles) Lisa?

502
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:14,453
You can never lose me.

503
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:15,955
We share the same blood,

504
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,557
the same mixed feelings
towards Bart,

505
00:19:18,593 --> 00:19:22,394
and you know I'll need support
in my teenage war with Mom.

506
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,231
(sobbing, laughing):
Oh, Lisa...

507
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:26,532
(both laughing)

508
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:27,533
Oh, Dad.

509
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:29,535
Dad!

510
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,003
Aw, sweetie...
Nothing could ever come between us.

511
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:33,172
...we'll be together forever.

512
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:34,707
ROGER:
Lisa, where are you, dear?

513
00:19:34,742 --> 00:19:36,876
I thought we'd get in
a game of chess

514
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:38,410
before we go pony shopping.

515
00:19:38,446 --> 00:19:40,146
Gotta go.

516
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:41,313
Lisa!

517
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:42,815
I'll Skype you
at Christmas!

518
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,285
(echoing):
Noooo!

519
00:19:48,055 --> 00:19:50,890
(Homer snoring)

520
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:53,058
Huh, so it was all
<i>my</i> dream.

521
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:55,895
I better find out
what this all means.

522
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,097
It means,
like all married women,

523
00:19:58,132 --> 00:20:00,199
sometimes you're sick
of your husband,

524
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:02,735
but sometimes you're afraid
of losing him.

525
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,503
And like all married men,

526
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,238
I didn't hear that first thing,

527
00:20:06,274 --> 00:20:09,041
and I'm overconfident
of the second.

528
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:10,876
So what do we do?

529
00:20:10,912 --> 00:20:13,779
I need some kind of guidance
to take away from all of this.

530
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:16,448
Put your finger on it
so I can tie it in a bow.

531
00:20:16,484 --> 00:20:17,850
Please?

532
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:19,552
Well, one thing
we therapists can give

533
00:20:19,587 --> 00:20:21,820
is concise, simple solutions,

534
00:20:21,856 --> 00:20:23,122
and yours is...

535
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,225
Hannah, what does
that one mean?

536
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,128
It means don't get
drunk in Brooklyn.
