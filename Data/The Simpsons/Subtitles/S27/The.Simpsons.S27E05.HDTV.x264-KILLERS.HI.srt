00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:56,780
14 spins, and Wendell threw up!

45
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:59,383
I didn't throw up, I held it in.

Mr. Largo?

55
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:21,405
Hmm, something's wrong.

56
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:23,841
That music is in tune.

57
00:02:24,843 --> 00:02:26,777
Hello, Bart.

Using Milhouse's phone.

00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:34,451
Did you know his wallpaper
is American Girl doll?

62
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:38,455
Now let me put this in terms
any young boy would understand:

63
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,025
you and I have danced
a grand pas de deux

64
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:42,793

65
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:46,130
But this is the final plié!

66
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:47,804
Yawn. You couldn't kill me
with that thing

67
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:50,200

some stupid...

73
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:03,247
(weakly): mistake.

74
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:04,848
Not this time.

75
00:03:04,883 --> 00:03:08,652

24 years of trying

You wouldn't know,

94
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:14,785
but that means "to your health,"

95
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,320
of which you have none!

Where's Bart?

104
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:39,109
I don't know
who you're talking about.

105
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:40,544
This Bart!

106
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:42,379
Well, I suppose that does look
damning,

107
00:04:42,414 --> 00:04:44,281
but have you seen this?

108
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:45,749
Ooh! Ah.

109
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:47,151
He's cool.

110
00:04:47,185 --> 00:04:48,852
Let's move on to
the next suspect.

111
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:51,288
(screams)

112
00:04:51,322 --> 00:04:52,990
Well, I'd better check it out.

113
00:04:58,096 --> 00:05:00,064
(sighs)

114
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:01,965
Not to complain,
but your stomach acids

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,734
are smoothing the dimples
off my balls.

116
00:05:03,768 --> 00:05:06,003
It's time I moved
to my post-Bartum phase.

117
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:07,871
I've accepted
an Associate Professorship

118
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:09,173
at Springfield University.

119
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:10,908

122
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:20,284
"I should have been
a pair of ragged claws,

123
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:24,021
scuttling across the floors
of silent seas."

124
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:26,356
What do Eliot's
ragged claws represent?

125
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:27,891
Yeah, um...

126
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:30,861
this Web site says
the claws aren't a metaphor,

127
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:33,530
but, like,
an insight to a state of mind.

128
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:35,032
Crushed it!

129
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:36,433
What Web site?
Forward the link.

130
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:37,801
Text me.
Tweet the link.

131
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:39,136
Where is it?

132
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,571
I didn't think
the author of <i>Cats</i>

133
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:41,905
could be insulted further.

134
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,507
Class dismissed.

Drivel!

138
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:51,548
What is this <i>Game of Thrones</i>

139
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:52,850
they're referencing?

140
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:54,752
I was a fool to think
I'd find solace

141
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:57,321
amongst these moronic,
Snapchatting, gap-yearing...

142
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:01,258
Hello, Bart.

143
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:03,293
It seems the only thing
that made me happy

144
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:06,196
in my accursed life
was killing you.

145
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:09,500
Well, if White Zinfandel
can make a comeback,

146
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:11,735
so can you.

147
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:20,878
Ooh, those bastards
know how to party!

148
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:23,814
(chuckles)

149
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:25,849
I feel like
a bad <i>New Yorker</i> cartoon.

150

(angry shouting)

151
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:38,028
And now, Bart,

152
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:39,630
let's bring the old "spark"

153
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:42,199
back to our special
relationship.

154
00:06:44,302 --> 00:06:46,270
You couldn't kill me

155
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:49,373
if I came in with pneumonia
and a knife in my back.

156
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:51,275
(groaning)

157
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:54,011
I didn't care for the "thwock"
the sledgehammer made.

158
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:56,747
No worries,
I'll just kill him again.

159
00:06:56,781 --> 00:07:00,050
That's why
I'm the un-killable kid.

160
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:02,319
(screams) Still not dead.

161
00:07:02,353 --> 00:07:03,520

and executed Jailbird,

182
00:07:57,442 --> 00:07:59,977
I knew it was Bob!

183
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,913
Reanimate?

184
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:05,382
This animation looks
good enough to me.

185
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,950
Homer, pull the lever!

186
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:10,053
(groans) I've been
pulling levers all day.

187
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:12,389
Now!

188
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:18,095
Wow, for once,
I was sober at Bart's birth.

189
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:19,730
Yes, that's right, Officer.

190
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:21,531
There are intruders
in my basement.

191
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:22,933
Have I the right to shoot?

192
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:24,201
Oh, yeah.

193
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:26,370
And you can wear blue jeans
to a Broadway show.

194
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:27,504
Everything's different now.

195
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:29,740
(beeps)

196
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:31,141
(groans)

197
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:32,509
Wait, Dad!

198
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:38,282
(grunting, groaning)

199
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:41,818
That's for trying
to frame Krusty.

200
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:44,021
What about all the times
he tried to kill me?

201
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:45,055
Eh.

202
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:46,823
As the one who suffered
the most, Mom,

203
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:48,959
may I have custody
of Bob's body?

204
00:08:48,993 --> 00:08:50,627
Normally I'd say no,

205
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:52,496
but you have been showing
responsibility

206
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,764
with the dog lately.

207
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:54,965
So, fine.

208
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:57,000
(humming)

209
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:00,904
(cackles)

210
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:08,045
SIDESHOW BOB: <i>"By Sea-Girls wreathed</i>
<i>with seaweed red and brown,</i>

211
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,414
"till human voices wake us

212
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:11,982
and we drown."

213
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:13,317
Any questions?

214
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:15,485
Yes, what are you
supposed to be again?

215
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,287
A full professor!

216
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:20,524
But the tenure committee
is excruciatingly slow.

217
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:22,526
(groaning)

218
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,428
(squawks)

219
00:09:39,434 --> 00:09:40,868
Hmm.

220
00:09:40,902 --> 00:09:42,670
(humming)

221
00:09:45,574 --> 00:09:47,241
Look at that foolish old man!

222
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:50,111
Every day he drops a perfectly
good donut into the ocean.

223
00:09:50,145 --> 00:09:52,947
Let us mock him
for his foolish beliefs!

224
00:09:52,981 --> 00:09:54,081
Yes! Yes!

225
00:09:54,116 --> 00:09:55,516
Let us show disrespect

226
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,917
with poorly-dubbed laughter.

227
00:09:56,952 --> 00:09:58,886
(delayed laughter)

228
00:10:01,723 --> 00:10:03,791
Children,
go with your grandfather.

229
00:10:03,825 --> 00:10:06,193
Can't we go with
dead Grandfather?

230
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:07,495
He cannot leave.

231
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:09,664
He is the spirit
of my tea kettle.

232
00:10:09,698 --> 00:10:10,998
Lucky me.

233
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:13,200
(whistling)

234
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:21,075
Grampa, everyone in town
thinks you are foolish.

235
00:10:21,109 --> 00:10:23,544
Who is more foolish--

236
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:25,313
the fool or the fool

237
00:10:25,347 --> 00:10:27,715
who thinks the fool a fool?

238
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:30,584
What the hell
does that mean, Grampa-san?

239
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:33,721
For centuries, our family
has made a daily offering

240
00:10:33,755 --> 00:10:36,090
of a special donut
to a slumbering

241
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:38,092
underwater sea creature,

242
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:41,762
so that he does not rise
and destroy us all.

243
00:10:41,797 --> 00:10:44,065
(both laughing)

244
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:46,267
He is foolish!

245
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:48,869
So foolish!
(laughs)

246
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:50,738
Doesn't mean
you are not special.

247
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:51,906
(groans)

248
00:11:09,257 --> 00:11:11,258
(humming a tune)

249
00:11:15,897 --> 00:11:16,864
(gasps)

250
00:11:16,898 --> 00:11:18,199
(gurgling)

251
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:20,234
(shouts)

252
00:11:22,871 --> 00:11:26,741
Now I have all eternity
to talk to you.

253
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:30,478
Oh...

254
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:35,716
Now we will
no longer have anyone

255
00:11:35,751 --> 00:11:38,085
uselessly floating donuts
in the ocean.

256
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,488
They have made
our fish fat and ugly.

257
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,690
Pathetic.

258
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:51,932
(roaring)

259
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:55,002
All right, calm down, children.

260
00:11:55,036 --> 00:11:58,339
Probably just excitement
over the cherry blossoms.

261
00:11:58,373 --> 00:12:00,141
Of course, the cherry blossoms!

262
00:12:00,175 --> 00:12:03,978
They're so beautiful, and yet...

263
00:12:05,747 --> 00:12:08,215
(roaring)

264
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,717
(people screaming)

265
00:12:11,853 --> 00:12:14,655
I still refuse to admit
the old man was right.

266
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:17,992
Legitimate
difference of opinion.

267
00:12:18,026 --> 00:12:20,261
Professor,
how do we stop him?

268
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:21,629
Fear not!

269
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:23,697
Without the buoyancy of water,

270
00:12:23,732 --> 00:12:26,333
it is physically impossible
for any creature that large

271
00:12:26,368 --> 00:12:28,202
not to collapse under
its own weight.

272
00:12:28,236 --> 00:12:29,737
It's a simple matter of--

273
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:32,206
gloy!

274
00:12:35,243 --> 00:12:36,277
D'oh!

275
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:37,344
Jo!

276
00:12:40,816 --> 00:12:44,084
(tires screech)

277
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,619
Scared by the monster?

278
00:12:45,654 --> 00:12:47,388
What monster?

279
00:12:47,422 --> 00:12:49,089
(roaring)

280
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:51,225
♪ Yellow ribbon 'round... ♪

281
00:12:52,394 --> 00:12:54,161
Huh? Aah!

282
00:12:54,196 --> 00:12:56,697
(grunts)

283
00:12:56,731 --> 00:12:58,399
Aah!

284
00:13:05,674 --> 00:13:08,042
(roaring)

285
00:13:08,076 --> 00:13:11,412
Why do you have
to stomp on our buildings?

286
00:13:11,446 --> 00:13:13,514
This land is 98% rural.

287
00:13:13,548 --> 00:13:17,985
So much farmland you can walk
on without hurting your feet.

288
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:20,955
(roars)

289
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:22,423
Right, right.

290
00:13:22,457 --> 00:13:24,024
The city's
the only place you can get

291
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:25,826
tuna rolls at 5:00
in the morning.

292
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:27,661
Because you do have
fishy breath.

293
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:29,196
I'm just telling you.

294
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:31,232
(roaring)

295
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:35,669
(grunts)

296
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:38,405
Ah, thank you.

297
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,907
(roars)

298
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:43,143
So, the key to this movie is
it's so cheap it's funny.

299
00:13:43,178 --> 00:13:45,145
Then just think how
popular it would be

300
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,314
if we spent a fortune
remaking it.

301
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:48,782
We'll make millions!

302
00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:50,918
After spending
hundreds of millions!

303
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:54,288
(all clamoring in agreement)

304
00:13:54,322 --> 00:13:57,157
We're here live
at the premiere of <i>'Zilla!</i>

305
00:13:57,192 --> 00:14:00,094
And this time, the stars
have come out at night!

306
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:02,830
Lurleen Lumpkin,
Drederick Tatum...

307
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:05,199
and my ex-husband,
the Grumple.

308
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:07,301
(both groaning)

309
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:09,236
As a tie-in to this movie,

310
00:14:09,271 --> 00:14:12,439
Krustyburgers will be made
from only reptile meat.

311
00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:14,942
And don't worry, PETA,

312
00:14:14,976 --> 00:14:17,578
we only buy the sick ones!

313
00:14:19,447 --> 00:14:21,715
(roars)

314
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,484
(gasps)

315
00:14:23,518 --> 00:14:25,519
(roaring)

316
00:14:34,262 --> 00:14:36,063
Buzz Cola!

317
00:14:36,097 --> 00:14:38,098
(roaring)

318
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:41,969
We can't stop him.

319
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:43,470
We can't!

320
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:45,539
All we can do
is avoid him easily!

321
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:49,176
(crying)

322
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,278
He's 2,000 miles away

323
00:14:51,313 --> 00:14:53,847
moving at two miles a day.

324
00:14:53,882 --> 00:14:55,349
What do I do?

325
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:57,585
What do I do?!

326
00:14:57,619 --> 00:15:01,255
(both roaring)

327
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,256
It's a total bomb.

328
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,091
We only sold one ticket.

329
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,126
Oh, I didn't buy
my ticket for this.

330
00:15:06,161 --> 00:15:08,529
I just wanted to get a good seat
for the next <i>Star Wars.</i>

331
00:15:08,563 --> 00:15:10,898
Which will stink
to high heaven.

332
00:15:10,932 --> 00:15:12,166
There's only one thing
we can do.

333
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,467
Dump everything at sea

334
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:15,102
and say we lost it
for insurance purposes.

335
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:16,637
Aw, yeah, that's
moviemaking, Steve.

336
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:18,872
That's why we all
report to you.

337
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:28,649
Toss them overboard,
then kill the navigator.

338
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:44,064
(roaring)

339
00:15:48,036 --> 00:15:49,903
(Homerzilla roaring)

340
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,223
LISA:
I see a Yellow Monarch,

341
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,991
a Woodland Skipper.

342
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,394
I see...
(both grunting, laughing)

343
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,962
You know, we have
been hiking for hours

344
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,931
and you two haven't spotted
a single butterfly.

345
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,366
I thought we were
hunting owls.

346
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,934
Well, you haven't
done that, either!

347
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,936
Uh-huh!
(Lisa screams)

348
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,571
(groaning)

349
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,508
(screams)

350
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,777
Don't worry,
the hole isn't very deep.

351
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,712
Oh, wait, I'm on a ledge.

352
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,747
(Milhouse screaming)

353
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,758
(thuds)

354
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:37,095
Oh, God, everything
is moist and moving!

355
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,098
LISA:
Bart?!

356
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,666
What?
I'm going home.

357
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,802
to my toy chest,
to get my barrel of monkeys,

358
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,371
to lower them down.

359
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,139
At least I'm pitching.

360
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,874
We got to save him!

361
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:52,343
Fine, but you'll follow me
with the camera, right?

362
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,745
'Cause the important thing
these days

363
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,914
is everything must be on film.

364
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,949
(grunts)

365
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,053
Okay, guys.

366
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:05,323
My cell phone is somewhere
in that pulsing ooze.

367
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,493
Now each grab one ankle
while I dive in!

368
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,894
We have to be careful, Milhouse.

369
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,629
There's no telling
what that Stu...

370
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:13,698
Bart, what are you doing?!

371
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,901
Madam, how do you do?

372
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,304
You don't know what that
stuff is doing to you!

373
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,373
Oh, it's just the same junk
Dad brings us home from work.

374
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:25,276
To us Simpsons, this
green goop is mother's...

375
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,879
(gasps)
Where are my owls?

376
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,848
(grunting)

377
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,517
Oh, man, am I looking
at a nosebleed!

378
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,487
(gasps) Somehow,
the radioactive explosion

379
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,990
gave us the power to move
things with our intellect.

380
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,759
Flowers for the lady?

381
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:42,794
(gasps)

382
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,295
(laughs)

383
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,332
Bart, what powers did
your brain give you?

384
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,701
Look, you're talking
to the guy that got demoted

385
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,403
from the Tadpoles
reading group, okay?

386
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,608
Do not make me pity fly.

387
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,845
Dignity restored.

388
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,680
You know, we can't
tell anyone about this.

389
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:04,382
There are going to be
lab tests and scientists...

390
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,117
Do we get to wear
those paper gowns?

391
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,819
BART:
Ow!

392
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,622
It's a dress that
boys can wear.

393
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,468
Wedgie!

394
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,804
This is not
a proportional punishment!

395
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,243
(grunts)

396
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,546
Hmm, somebody
misspelled "wiener."

397
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,686
(gasps)
Lisa Simpson!

398
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,422
The Musicians Union
does not allow this!

399
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,724
You know this is
an ASCAP household.

400
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,660
God gave you this
power for good,

401
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,396
not jazz, and...

402
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,201
The 'House always wins!

403
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,536
I even got my parents
back together!

404
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,572
Even now I don't
feel close to you.

405
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:01,973
(groans)

406
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,043
Ah, finally I can
diaper all my children.

407
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,512
Yo, hands up.
(groans)

408
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,048
Hmm, Milhouse has
gone mad with power.

409
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,585
Frankly, I thought
it wouldn't take this long.

410
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,753
Everything's coming
up Milhouse!

411
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,632
Nicely done, Lis.

412
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,200
I didn't do it.

413
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:32,003
Then I want to
know who did!

414
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,972
But not that badly.

415
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,907
(giggles, coos)

416
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,943
(piano playing
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star")

417
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,499
Excuse me, uh,

418
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,768
<i>Ou est Le Eiffel Tower?</i>

419
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:07,772
I appreciate that you are
trying to learn our language.

420
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,142
(yawns)

421
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,116
Once again we just
have a cameo.

422
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,819
Don't complain or they'll
put us in 4x3.

423
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:24,489
Aah, they're doing it! No!

424
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,491
Just 'cause it looks
like season four

425
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,760
doesn't make it
season four!

426
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:35,294

427
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:16,174
(Homerzilla roaring)
