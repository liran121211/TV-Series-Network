Yes, uh,

6
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:24,506
the students
of Springfield Elementary

7
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,943
have each created
an alternative energy vehicle.

8
00:00:27,978 --> 00:00:31,279
One of which will ensure
the future of humanity

9
00:00:31,315 --> 00:00:33,515
as determined by a short race
across the parking lot.

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,584
(mumbles):
Yeah, yeah.

00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,286
And now, uh, what is
your car powered by, uh,

12
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:40,121
fat little boy?

13
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:42,290
Hydrogen-powered fuel cells.

Ah, hydrogen--
yeah, yes, wonderful.

15
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:46,294
My car is powered by the wind!

16
00:00:47,664 --> 00:00:49,431
Oh, how it blows.

17
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,466
Mine is potato-powered.

18
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:54,769

I'm not a potato.

Dad, I'm so excited!
I think--

21
00:00:58,508 --> 00:01:00,508
Hey, please don't
stand so close.

22
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:03,945
In the world of solar power,
shadows are the arch-enemy.

23
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,480
I think I might win.

24
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:07,349
I believe in you

That kid's car has flames
painted on the side of it.

27
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:13,889
Why would he do it
if it wasn't fast?

28
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:17,626
Children, start your engines!

29
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:18,894
They're not engines!

30
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:20,829

point of this thing!

Huh?

39
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:40,015
What? No!
That shouldn't happen!

40
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,417
I should have stored energy!

41
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:46,421
You skimped on the cadmium
in your batteries,

42
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:48,490
just like a girl.

43
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,592
Stick to the liberal
arts, honey.

Uh, have fun going
to Oberlin! (laughs)

45
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,330
Maybe you can transfer
after a couple years...

46
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,198
to Bates! (laughing)

47
00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:59,334

Now, don't you worry, kid.

52
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,378
They also laughed
at Amelia Vanderbuckle.

54
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:13,615
Amelia Vanderbuckle?
Who's she?

55
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,918
Ah, she was Springfield's
original lady inventor.

56
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:18,186
Ah...!

57
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,921
Why have I never
heard of her?

58
00:02:19,957 --> 00:02:21,756
Well, totally nuts.

59
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,058
She made a mess of everything.

60
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:24,426
Oh!

61
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:26,895
Easy, girly, don't go
Vanderbuckle on us.

62
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,296

63
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:36,938
"Amelia Vanderbuckle

"in the 1800s.

"She was the middle child
of a family of 17.

"12 of whom died
from exposure to drafty windows.

canary in the poison mines."

female graduate
of Springfield Tech."

00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,622
Do you have to
read out loud?

71
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:56,891

she was the proud inventor

of the steam-powered
barber chair."

"A medical board
diagnosed Amelia

"with acute feminine
overreachism and she was--

BART:<i> Ay, carumba!</i>

86
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,266
Bart, if we find
those inventions,

87
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,635
we can prove that Amelia
was scientifically significant.

88
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,103
Pass.

89
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,505
Listen to me.

90
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,106
I need to prove
this woman was not a lunatic

91
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,375
so people will not giggle
when they hear the words

92
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:48,777
"woman scientist."

93
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,146
(chuckles)
"Woman scientist."

94
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:54,349
What's next--
boy cigarette girl?

95
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:56,151
(Grampa laughs in distance)
Let me ask again.

96
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:59,821
Will you help me break into
an abandoned insane asylum?

97
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:01,790
(wind gusting, whistling)

98
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,726
Abandoned asylum, where
have you been all my life?

99
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:06,161
How do we get in?

100
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:08,630
Well, I'd say
the best bet

101
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,665
is the sewer pipe.

102
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:10,765
Oh, gee.

103
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:13,068
(echoing):
Oh, come on, Bart.

104
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:14,669
Or this door.

105
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:16,171
Bart!

106
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:17,839

108
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,814
The ghosts of a thousand
lunatics are making me hot.

109
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,216
Yeah, what doesn't
make you hot?

110
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:30,251
Alcoholic stepfathers.

111
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:35,924
(goofy grunting
and snorting)

112
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,826
Ew! Stop that!

113
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,828
You don't know who had
that in their mouth.

114
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,262
Sure I do--
some luno!

115
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:42,931
Mmm, that's good crazy.

116
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:44,265

AMELIA: Though I have been locked up
in this sanitarium

127
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,588
for lo, these many years,

128
00:05:06,623 --> 00:05:09,858
I have completed an invention
that will change the world!

129
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,059
Bart! Did you hear that?

130
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:12,527
(imitating Dracula):
Good evening.

131
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,463
Because I am not taken seriously
due to my gender,

132
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:17,966
a friendly guard
has hidden my invention

133
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:20,702
until a future time,
when some liberated young woman

134
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,471
has the permission
of her husband to look for it.

135
00:05:23,507 --> 00:05:25,406
There's a whole closet
of these things!

136
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:27,876
How many magicians
do they have in this place?

137
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,978
Find my journal,
and it will lead you

138
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:31,880
to my greatest invention!

139
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:35,049
P.S. Nikola Tesla might have
told you he broke up with<i> me,</i>

140
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,784
but I broke up with<i> him.</i>

141
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,219
Aah!

142
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,189
We've got to find that journal.

143
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:49,464
Ooh!

144
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:54,035
"Dear Diary, today I watched
a neighbor's house burn down.

145
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,571
This will teach their dog
to laugh at me."

146
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:00,475
Whoa! Look at me!
I'm enjoying reading!

147
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:03,244
Guys, did you
ever read something

148
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,346
and think it was written
just for you?

149
00:06:05,382 --> 00:06:08,550
Behold...
the diary of Nathan Little!

150
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:14,022
"I pushed a vagabond
under a trolley."

151
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:15,657
What's a trolley?

152
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:16,758
Old-timey subway.

153
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,826
What's a vagabond?
Homeless guy.

154
00:06:18,862 --> 00:06:21,262
(sobbing, wailing)

155
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,398
What's a homeless guy?

156
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,770
Ralphie! Come on,
we got daddy-son tap class!

157
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,371
Tap class!

158
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:33,007
Hey, where is that kid?
We got a recital next week

159
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:35,310
and his timestep is terrible,
let alone flair.

160
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:36,945
Tap class!

161
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,047
Tuh... tap class?

162
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:40,048
(boys scream)

163
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,916
Ralphie, what is
going on here?

164
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:44,719
Bart made us read pages
from a scary diary.

165
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:48,156
I was so a-scared, sour juice
came out my front tail.

166
00:06:49,793 --> 00:06:52,393
Bart wrote this?
This is<i> bad.</i>

167
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:54,128
Ooh,<i> really</i> bad.

168
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,764
I don't think we're
gonna make it to...

169
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,766
tap class.

170
00:06:58,802 --> 00:06:59,802
(knocking on door)

171
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,670
Chief Wiggum?
Your son is dead...

172
00:07:02,706 --> 00:07:04,105
(loud gasp)

173
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,906
...inside.

174
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:07,108
(quieter gasp)

175
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:08,610
That's bad, too.

176
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:10,979
Yeah, these are pages
from your son's diary.

177
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,681
I'm afraid they very
clearly show him to be...

178
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:15,483
a sociopath.

179
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,319
Hm. Well, I've never seen Bart
write in cursive,

180
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,355
so I'm a little proud of that,

181
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,190
but this is the worst thing

182
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:24,525
that's ever happened
to this family.

183
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:25,994
I-I'm sorry, Marge.

184
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,862
And... shuffle off,

185
00:07:27,897 --> 00:07:28,963
shuffle off,

186
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:30,198
shuffle off.

187
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:34,955
(Homer humming cheerfully)

188
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:37,391
Homie, I've learned
something terrible about Bart.

189
00:07:37,426 --> 00:07:40,528
You may want to have a drink.
Way ahead of ya.

190
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:43,931
Chief Wiggum found these pages
from our son's diary!

191
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:46,700
Oh, I've had a long day.

192
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:48,936
Bart might be
a sociopath.

193
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:50,437
Socio-what?

194
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:53,541
(groans) "Someone who
can't feel empathy or guilt.

195
00:07:53,576 --> 00:07:56,911
They do terrible things
and don't care who it hurts."

196
00:07:56,946 --> 00:07:58,112
(doorbell chiming
repeatedly)

197
00:07:58,147 --> 00:07:59,313
Don't answer that!

198
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:00,748
It could be Bart!

199
00:08:00,783 --> 00:08:03,651
Bart has a key.
What?! Who gave him a key!

200
00:08:03,686 --> 00:08:04,652
Hey, Mrs. Simpson.

201
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:06,287
Can Bart come over

202
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:08,088
and see
my grandfather's collection

203
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:10,491
of Japanese swords
and throwing daggers?

204
00:08:10,526 --> 00:08:14,261
Aah! Why don't you play
with Lisa instead, hmm?

205
00:08:14,297 --> 00:08:15,262
(grunts)

206
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:17,598
<i>Konnichi-whaaa...?!</i>

207
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:18,732
Hey, Milhouse.

208
00:08:18,768 --> 00:08:20,668
Wow,<i> this</i> is
a surprise.

209
00:08:20,703 --> 00:08:23,671
I'm usually sweating when
we talk, but not this time.

210
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:27,341
It's amazing how you can charm
<i> and</i> disgust me at the same time.

211
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:28,943
That's just what happens

212
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:31,412
when I'm with the
prettiest girl in town.

213
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:32,613
Aw...

214
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:34,148
(cackles, snorts)

215
00:08:34,183 --> 00:08:35,282
Ew.

216
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:37,017
Amelia's journal tells us

217
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:38,986
that her invention
is buried in the basement

218
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:41,021
of the Springfield
Suffragette Society.

219
00:08:41,057 --> 00:08:42,957
(sighs): Ah...
anyone ever tell you

220
00:08:42,992 --> 00:08:45,159
you're beautiful when
you're sleuthing?

221
00:08:45,194 --> 00:08:48,462
Milhouse, did the Hardy Boys
ever hit on Nancy Drew?

222
00:08:48,497 --> 00:08:50,164
Frank did, but Joe...

223
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:53,033
let's just say there's
a mystery about<i> him.</i>

224
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:56,303
The Suffragette Society
was right here.

225
00:08:59,675 --> 00:09:02,042
Oh... here?

226
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:04,545
Hey, sweetie, you
looking for your mom?

227
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,314
I'll find her-- just, uh,
give me her cup size.

228
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,882
Actually, we're here
because your basement

229
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:11,051
is home to a landmark
of feminist history.

230
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:13,020
Do you mind
if we poke around?

231
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:14,655
The basement, eh?
Yeah, that's where

232
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,524
we wash the ketchup off
the old onion rings.

233
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,060
So no.
These guys want a children's menu?

234
00:09:20,096 --> 00:09:21,662
Nah, they're just leavin'.

235
00:09:21,697 --> 00:09:23,998
Seriously, kids, I got
to switch ten TV's

236
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:27,735
over to the fourth round of
the NBA draft, so get lost.

237
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,505
All right, Denver Nuggets
on the clock, people!

238
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,874
Okay, I found
a test online

239
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,743
that will tell us,
once and for all,

240
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:37,678
whether Bart is a...
you know.

241
00:09:37,713 --> 00:09:38,746
HOMER:
Wait a minute!

242
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:40,080
We can't just give Bart

243
00:09:40,116 --> 00:09:41,815
something labeled
"Sociopath Test"!

244
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:44,752
He might look it up and set
us on fire with his mind!

245
00:09:44,787 --> 00:09:46,353
You're right!
We need Bart to think

246
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:48,022
the test is
for something else.

247
00:09:48,057 --> 00:09:50,557
Finally! A use for
the label maker!

248
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:56,363
One of you betrayed me, and
snitches lose their stitches.

249
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,098
(high-pitched):
Sit on my banana!

250
00:09:58,134 --> 00:09:59,667
(normal voice):
Why, you little...!

251
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:01,001
(grunting)

252
00:10:01,037 --> 00:10:03,170
Where does he get this stuff?

253
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:05,939
Hey, son, your mom and I
just found this quiz

254
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:07,675
you'd really love to take.

255
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,276
"Are You a Jet Ski Dude

256
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:11,211
or a Motocross Maestro?"

257
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:12,887
Remember to answer the
questions honestly.

258
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:15,582
We want to know if you meet
the clinical definition

259
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:17,785
of "jet ski dude."

260
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,691
"I enjoy manipulating
other people."

261
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:25,559
"I believe I'm being followed."

262
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:29,096
"Sometimes I feel as if I must
injure myself or someone else."

263
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:30,131
Agree, agree, agree.

264
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:32,700
Hmm.

265
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:33,801
"Sociopath."

266
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:34,935
What's that?

267
00:10:37,673 --> 00:10:39,239
<i>Ay, carumba!</i>

268
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:41,241
That's what they think I am?

269
00:10:41,277 --> 00:10:44,745
Fine! I'll pretend to be the
biggest sociopath in the world!

270
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,448
And I only need to change
three answers.

271
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:48,882
Is he nuts?
I don't know.

272
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:50,884
What do you think?
I mean, he looks nuts,

273
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,786
that's for sure.
(clears throat)

274
00:10:52,822 --> 00:10:54,788
So, here's your test.

275
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:56,957
Call me crazy,
but I enjoyed it.

276
00:10:56,992 --> 00:10:58,659
(Bart whistling
"Pop Goes the Weasel")

277
00:11:00,863 --> 00:11:03,831
Well, the good news
is that Bart just got

278
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,266
his first 100%
ever on a test.

279
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:08,669
Oh, my God.
What do we do?

280
00:11:08,704 --> 00:11:10,104
Whatever Bart wants.

281
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:11,839

(male voice, Scottish accent): My pleasure.

297
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:11,865
Anything to take down
Knockers.

298
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:14,134
I've always hated them,
because they wouldn't open up

299
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:18,238
at 4:00 a.m. to show the World
Caber Tossing Championships.

300
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:20,674
Okay, Willie, you can
only use the jackhammer

301
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:22,810
when there's lots
of noise upstairs.

302
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:24,211
No worries.

303
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:26,046
It<i> is</i> Monday Night
Football,

304
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:28,315
by which I mean
American football,

305
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,484
by which I mean
no football at all!

306
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,386
(muffled cheering and applause)
(jackhammering)

307
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:34,555
(gasps)
There's the box!

308
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,830
(muffled cheering and applause)

309
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:39,927
Ow! Medium spicy!

310
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:42,095
Ach! We've hit
the hot sauce supply line!

311
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:46,900
I'll have to neutralize it
with some signature blue cheese!

312
00:12:46,936 --> 00:12:49,403
Ah...!

313
00:12:50,873 --> 00:12:53,707
Look at me! I'm a sociopath!

314
00:12:53,742 --> 00:12:55,776
Marge, it's time
we did something.

315
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:58,445
We can take him swimming.
That makes him sleepy.

316
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,881
Not good enough.
We have to call the number

317
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,616
at the bottom
of the test.

318
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:04,451
What number?

319
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:06,119
HOMER: Right there.
MARGE: "New Beginnings"?

320
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:09,122
We're gonna trust our son
to an 800 number?

321
00:13:09,158 --> 00:13:11,124
It's 888.

322
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,126
Marge, this is
for his own good.

323
00:13:13,162 --> 00:13:14,962
He failed an online test.

324
00:13:14,997 --> 00:13:17,764
How much more
proof do you need?

325
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,633
Cue-abunga!

326
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:21,301
(bird squawks, Bart laughs)

327
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:25,038
Surprise!
Surprise!

328
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:27,040
Whoa, cool! But wait a minute,

329
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:29,042
my birthday's not
for another two months.

330
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:31,879
We know! But we wanted
to have your party now!

331
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:35,315
They were having a
sale on piñatas and...

332
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:38,518
one thing led to another
so we, you know,

333
00:13:38,554 --> 00:13:40,320
had a thing,
mumble, mumble, mumble...

334
00:13:40,356 --> 00:13:41,421
mumble...

335
00:13:41,457 --> 00:13:42,656
Well, where are my friends?

336
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:44,658
Well, I was gonna
mail out invites,

337
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:48,295
but I was out of stamps and
the post office line was long,

338
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,998
(mumbling): and I didn't
know where all the little...

339
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:52,599
Well, more cake for me.

340
00:13:52,635 --> 00:13:54,935
No, no, no, no.
Do the Moon Bounce first.

341
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,770
Yes! The Moon Bounce!

342
00:13:56,805 --> 00:14:00,007
Don't want you throwing up
this delicious cake.

343
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:01,042
(clunking)

344
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:05,846
(grunting, laughing)

345
00:14:09,385 --> 00:14:10,884
(laughing)

346
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,085
Huh.

347
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:13,086
Eh.

348
00:14:13,122 --> 00:14:15,889
(laughing)

349
00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:18,358
(engine revs, tires squeal)
BART: Whoa!

350
00:14:18,394 --> 00:14:21,094
(Bart laughing)

351
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:29,369
Wait a minute.
What is this?

352
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:30,537
Is it an asylum?

353
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:32,139
No, it's a pizza parlor.

354
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:34,541
Please tell me, Dad,
is it really a pizza parlor?

355
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:37,544
No, son-- the pizza parlor
is where your mom and I

356
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:40,314
are going afterwards.
Now, you're gonna be fine.

357
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:42,716
I wouldn't be surprised if you
were the least messed-up kid

358
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:44,718
in the whole joint.
We love you!

359
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,720
(doors squeak and clang)

360
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:49,389
Wait, wait, wait! I didn't
even get to say good-bye.

361
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:52,726
Good-bye!
I'll<i> never</i> forgive you!

362
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:53,761
There. You happy?

363
00:14:57,452 --> 00:14:59,752
Let me out!
I was just playing a joke!

364
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:02,989
A cruel joke on the people that
love me! That I don't regret!

365
00:15:03,024 --> 00:15:04,490
That doesn't make me
a sociopath!

366
00:15:04,526 --> 00:15:06,492
(door creaks open)
WOMAN: Children,

367
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:08,761
form a line
in order of medication

368
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:10,930
from Adderall to Zoloft.

369
00:15:14,469 --> 00:15:16,669
You have been brought here
for a purpose.

370
00:15:16,705 --> 00:15:17,670
You are fearless,

371
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:19,105
and no one can stop you.

372
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,940
Which means you'll be
of great use...

373
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:23,176
To the U.S. military.

374
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:26,145
I expected more
of a reaction.

375
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:28,414
I waited outside
the door and everything.

376
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,984
They don't react.
That's what we want.

377
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,685
Right.

378
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:35,288
We'll be using you
in the ultimate video game

379
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:38,791
to test these U.S. Air Force
drone simulators.

380
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:41,527
Man, that is
a tough crowd.

381
00:15:41,563 --> 00:15:42,829
HOMER: Oh!

382
00:15:44,232 --> 00:15:47,200
Mom, Dad, I've discovered
the most amazing thing!

383
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:49,636
I can't wait...
Um, where's Bart?

384
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:52,372
He's safe.
And more importantly, we're safe.

385
00:15:52,407 --> 00:15:53,806
(sobs)

386
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:56,242
I miss him so much.

387
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:58,378
(panting)

388
00:15:58,413 --> 00:16:00,313
Oh. Can I call him?

389
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:02,515
You can call his guard, Tico.

390
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,716
He picks up sometimes.

391
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:05,018
I see.

392
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:06,986
Okay, I'll do that.

393
00:16:07,022 --> 00:16:08,821
Homie, where
did we go wrong?

394
00:16:08,857 --> 00:16:11,224
I don't know, sweetie.
I don't know.

395
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:15,495
We did everything we could for
him during the commercials.

396
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,230
And we're live

397
00:16:17,265 --> 00:16:18,564
as Lisa Simpson prepares
to prove

398
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,166
that Springfield embarrassment

399
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:22,168
Amelia Vanderbuckle
deserves to be

400
00:16:22,203 --> 00:16:24,237
in the female scientific
pantheon,

401
00:16:24,272 --> 00:16:26,506
along with Marie Curie and, uh,

402
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,508
you know, uh, um,

403
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:31,077
Velma from<i> Scooby-Doo.</i>

404
00:16:31,112 --> 00:16:32,912
Thank you all for coming out

405
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:36,575
to support a woman's place
in history!

406
00:16:36,576 --> 00:16:37,817
That's what this is?

407
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:39,841
I thought it was a
Green Bay Packers rally.

408
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:42,255
All right, you know what,
this ain't coming off.

409
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,326
Behold, the masterpiece
of Amelia Vanderbuckle.

410
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:48,361
(crowd murmurs)

411
00:16:48,396 --> 00:16:49,696
A loom?!

412
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:50,697
That isn't science.

413
00:16:50,732 --> 00:16:52,365
That's home economics.

414
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,367
Everyone, storm the stage!

415
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:56,336
(crowd clamoring)
Not so fast!

416
00:16:56,371 --> 00:16:58,037
This is no ordinary loom!

417
00:16:58,073 --> 00:16:59,872
Even an extraordinary loom

418
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:02,408
is the most boring thing
I could think of.

419
00:17:02,444 --> 00:17:06,079
This is much, much more
than just a loom.

420
00:17:06,114 --> 00:17:07,547
(clacking)

421
00:17:07,582 --> 00:17:09,282
(squeaking, clicking;
Lisa grunts)

422
00:17:09,317 --> 00:17:11,784
(whirring, clanking)

423
00:17:16,024 --> 00:17:18,091
(puffing)

424
00:17:20,662 --> 00:17:22,028
(crowd gasping in wonder)

425
00:17:22,063 --> 00:17:24,197
It's alive!
And polite!

426
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:29,502
"Operand"? Looks like it wants
us to give it a math problem.

427
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:36,676
(grunting)

428
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:37,744
(whirring, thudding)

429
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:40,079
Oh, my God. Oh, God!

430
00:17:40,115 --> 00:17:42,648
It's the first
computational device!

431
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:44,450
People, people,
don't you see?

432
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:46,052
The board acts
like punch cards

433
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:47,954
and the loom
like a computer,

434
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:51,391
with the Charles Babbage
and the John Von Neumann...

435
00:17:51,426 --> 00:17:54,827
Let's have the square root
of nine cheers for Lisa!

436
00:17:56,264 --> 00:17:57,797
(whirring, clanking)

437
00:17:57,832 --> 00:18:01,501
ALL: Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!

438
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,438
You see that, Bart?
You see what your sister did?

439
00:18:05,473 --> 00:18:06,473
Yeah, yeah, great.

440
00:18:06,508 --> 00:18:08,441
Listen, I'm in a simulator,

441
00:18:08,476 --> 00:18:09,876
so I can't really talk.

442
00:18:09,911 --> 00:18:11,778
And you know I'm a sociopath,

443
00:18:11,813 --> 00:18:13,513
so I'm just going through
the motions here.

444
00:18:13,548 --> 00:18:14,680
I love you.

445
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:16,115
I was just saying that
to myself.

446
00:18:16,151 --> 00:18:17,850
(beep)

447
00:18:17,886 --> 00:18:20,520
Kaboom! Blam-blam-blam!

448
00:18:20,555 --> 00:18:21,554
Have a smart bomb, stupid.

449
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:22,655
(imitates explosions)

450
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,357
Nice<i> not</i> knowin' ya.

451
00:18:24,392 --> 00:18:25,725
MALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
All targets destroyed.

452
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,293
Simulation complete.

453
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,464
You are impressive.

454
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:33,633
Even though I'm the only
real person in the world,

455
00:18:33,668 --> 00:18:36,035
and, therefore, I created you
in my imagination.

456
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:38,871
Children, your empty souls
and flying fingers

457
00:18:38,907 --> 00:18:41,641
are very impressive,
and I can tell you now

458
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:44,210
that was no simulation.

459
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:46,979
You mean
we were blowing up real stuff?

460
00:18:47,015 --> 00:18:49,816
That's right-- convoys,
terrorist training camps,

461
00:18:49,851 --> 00:18:52,618
suspicious weddings,
Kabul Starbucks.

462
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:54,287
Cool!
Awesome. - I knew it!

463
00:18:54,322 --> 00:18:56,522
(voice breaking): No, I thought
it was a video game.

464
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:58,524
I don't want
to hurt real people.

465
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,726
Oh, I want to go home.

466
00:19:00,762 --> 00:19:02,228
Please?

467
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,663
How disappointing.

468
00:19:03,698 --> 00:19:06,833
Does anyone else share
the human boy's feelings?

469
00:19:06,868 --> 00:19:09,836
Son, the truth is
the simulators we told you

470
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:13,172
<i>weren't</i> simulators
<i>were</i> simulators.

471
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,073
(all gasping)

472
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:15,341
Now, I'm sorry, Bart,

473
00:19:15,376 --> 00:19:17,743
but you are a healthy,
normal boy.

474
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:19,378
We're sending you home.

475
00:19:19,414 --> 00:19:22,048
Really? Oh, wow.
Dudes, it's been real.

476
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,883
Although, actually,
it was all a fake.

477
00:19:23,918 --> 00:19:26,052
I'll never forget you,
Bart Simpson.

478
00:19:26,087 --> 00:19:28,054
742 Evergreen Terrace.

479
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:30,256
Dog door in the back
that has no lock.

480

(knocking on door)

481
00:19:33,461 --> 00:19:35,761
My little guy is back!

482
00:19:35,797 --> 00:19:39,198
And I'm not bad!
I just made bad decisions.

483
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:41,033
(crying):
It's okay, boy.

484
00:19:41,069 --> 00:19:44,103
You started out life
as a bad decision.

485
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:47,273
The best bad decision
I ever made.

486
00:19:47,308 --> 00:19:49,609
(all crying)

487
00:19:49,644 --> 00:19:52,612
(crying): And I restored
the reputation

488
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:55,281
of a scientist
from 100 years ago.

489
00:19:57,418 --> 00:20:01,053
(crying): And Maggie tried
strawberries for the first time.

490
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:04,790
What a day!
What a day!

491
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:06,058
(sucking pacifier)

492
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,784
Okay, Lisa, go
ahead and say it.

493
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:13,220
Don't be ashamed.

494
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:14,888
I'm immortal!

495
00:20:14,924 --> 00:20:17,091
(echoing): ...immortal!

496
00:20:17,126 --> 00:20:20,094
Hey, Madam Docent,
want to come see?

497
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:22,496
DOCENT: Oh, I'd love to, but
there's a huge crowd here

of Thor exhibit.

Hey, tour! Want to see a great
invention and its plaque?

We're just passing through
to the cafe.

501
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:31,505
Double-time, tour.

502
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:34,575
