57
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,003
Doesn't matter!
It's a great camp.

Pete Barbutti.

Pete Barbutti?!

60
00:03:04,043 --> 00:03:05,976
Yes! Anyway, it's
a little pricey.

big tonight,

149
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,764
I saw a commercial for one where
an old lady gave a thumbs-up

150
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:58,100

which filled up the screen.

00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,339
Hey, Homer, here's a thought:
invite Laney over for dinner.

154
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,242
Show her your crummy home,
your unhappy kids.

155

00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:16,251
Oh, yeah. Your whole house,

You can't be serious!

356
00:15:22,683 --> 00:15:24,383
I said fade!

357
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:26,985
Everyone, meet me back here
in however long it takes

358
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:28,520
to wake up
from five Valium.

359
00:15:28,556 --> 00:15:29,788
On the dot!

360
00:15:29,824 --> 00:15:31,323
(horns honking)

361
00:15:33,828 --> 00:15:36,128
Hey, man, how'd
you get that seat?

362
00:15:36,163 --> 00:15:38,497
They thought
I was pregnant.

363
00:15:40,534 --> 00:15:42,501
(indistinct chatter)

364
00:15:46,173 --> 00:15:48,273
It's showtime, Laney.
Time to see if there's still

365
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:52,311
a spark left in that smoldering
Duraflame log you call a career.

366
00:15:54,114 --> 00:15:55,080
Hey, Laney.

367
00:15:55,115 --> 00:15:56,815
Moe, I need you.

368
00:15:56,851 --> 00:15:59,685
To make me feel confident,
strong and beautiful.

369
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,221
Boy, I'm not real good at
boosting self-esteem there.

370
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:04,957
But, uh, if you make a
mistake, I can fire my gun.

371
00:16:04,992 --> 00:16:07,359
And that's what the critics
will be yappin' about tomorrow.

372
00:16:07,394 --> 00:16:08,394
(chuckles)

373
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,968
That's not
encouragement!

374
00:16:16,003 --> 00:16:18,470

I'm sorry, ma'am.
The show is sold out

391
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,213

00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:02,714
My daughter's in there.

393
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,316
Eh, we all got

394
00:17:04,351 --> 00:17:06,785
I'm a ticket seller

395

398
00:17:14,562 --> 00:17:16,528
I have no choice now
but to be corrupt.

Yeah. Letting our daughter

with an 80-year-old diva
and some sketchy jazz guys

MILHOUSE:
Hey!

420
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:19,458
When does the
show start?

421
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:21,660
It did, and it was wonderful.

422
00:18:21,695 --> 00:18:24,329
Eh, she's been bitten
by the showbiz bug.

423
00:18:24,365 --> 00:18:26,999
And when that happens,
only working with Bruce Willis

424
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:28,266
can extinguish it.

(giggles)

426
00:18:31,338 --> 00:18:34,039
(sighs) Okay. Just
finish out the tour.

427
00:18:34,074 --> 00:18:36,541
We'll see you
in Pittsfield.

428
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:43,081
No way!

429
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:45,417
Pittsfield ain't happening
for this little scene stealer.

430
00:18:45,452 --> 00:18:48,754
I love you, Lisa, but you got
a bigger ovation than me.

431
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:51,323
So we can never share
the same stage again.

432
00:18:51,358 --> 00:18:53,392
What? How can you say that?

are going great,

435
00:18:57,431 --> 00:18:59,398
they pull the rug out
from under you.

436
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:01,333
Bad news, Laney.
We're shutting down.

437
00:19:01,368 --> 00:19:03,935
Never cleared the rights to
"Everything's Coming Up Roses."

See what I mean?

439
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:07,005

that rug.
