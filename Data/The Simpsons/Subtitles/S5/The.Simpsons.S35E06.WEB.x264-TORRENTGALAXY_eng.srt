You guys have...
Done so much for me.

Enjoying your present, huh?

186
00:07:55,143 --> 00:07:56,726
Don't play with it all day!

187

Roger that. Face is prepared.

This spy kit is great!

192

"itch, please."

Wait, I get it!

204
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:42,772
"itch" rhymes with "bi--"

Trust me.

Maybe she's unknowable.

What if we just give her
the spy kit

289
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,519

for the rest of her life?

00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:14,830
Like my son's pancakes.

357
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:19,585
The air at springfield park
is full of pollen.

358
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:22,254
Individuals with lungs
should avoid the area.

359
00:15:23,675 --> 00:15:26,634
Lifeless bodies at the park.
Possible gas leak.

360
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,470
Demented man throwing objects
at the duck pond.

361
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,263
Chemical air attack
at the play yard.

362
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:33,641
Ufos hovering over picnic area.

363
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:37,186
String-guided dragons, most
likely time travelers attack...

364
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:39,438
I saw the kites first,
ya big galoot!

365
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:43,317
What happened?

366
00:15:43,403 --> 00:15:46,237
The earth couldn't support
your giant ass.

367
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:47,989
Maybe satan heard your voice

368
00:15:48,074 --> 00:15:50,157
And decided to fast-track you
to hell.

369
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:52,493
Okay, we both got one in.

370
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,870
How are we getting
out of this sinkhole?

371
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:57,164
I dropped my phone.
Do you have yours?

372
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,001
No. Just start shouting.
Someone will hear us.

373
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:01,919
-Help!
-Down here!

374
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:03,921
Save me, not her!

375
00:16:04,007 --> 00:16:06,799
hurry, the dragons are coming!

376
00:16:06,926 --> 00:16:10,261
Oh, yeah, petey.
He was smart as a whip.

377
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:13,297
Could imitate anything:
Political figures of the day,

378
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:16,100
The "you lose" horn
from<i> price is right.</i>

379
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,185
So many times I thought
contestants lost

380
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:19,437
When they hadn't.

381
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:22,982
Why are you talking
about him in the past tense?

382
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:26,652
Oh, I left his cage open
by mistake and he flew away.

383
00:16:26,738 --> 00:16:29,321
Last I heard, he joined
a flock of wild parrots.

384
00:16:29,407 --> 00:16:32,950
Oh. I guess we came
all this way for nothing.

385
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:34,452
Stay in town.

386
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:36,203
But my daughter's wedding is...

387
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,707
shirl? Bad news.

388
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,959
We failed mom again.

389
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:44,378
We are losers.

390
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:49,675
Bart, it's petey!

391
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:51,802
How can we lure him down here?

392
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:53,471
Uh, uh, I've got it.

393
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:56,474
<i> bart,</i>
<i> are you secretly recording me?</i>

394
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:59,018
<i> I'm on hold to talk</i>
<i> about our water bill.</i>

395
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:00,895
<i> I'm sorry, no,</i>
<i> I'm not talking to you.</i>

396
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,105
<i>I'm talking to my annoying son.</i>

397
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:04,648
-Yes!
-Got him!

398
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:05,900
annoying son.

399
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:07,234
hello?!

400
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,528
Can't any of you
idiots hear us?!

401
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:12,948
There's no one to save us.
We scared everyone away.

402
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:15,743
-Isn't that ironic?
-I guess.

403
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,995
No, I'm asking.
I don't know what ironic means.

404
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:20,122
Why did we get so crazy?

405
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:21,874
I was doing a public service.

406
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,417
I warned everyone
that broken sprinkler

407
00:17:23,503 --> 00:17:24,794
Would cause a sinkhole.

408
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:27,922
Bull-scat. You were trying to
move up the leaderboard.

409
00:17:28,091 --> 00:17:31,092
-We both were.
-Now we're stuck down here.

410
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:34,136
I miss the surface world.

411
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:36,347
Hey, you gotta share that!

412
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:38,682
We both need strength
to fight off chuds.

413
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:42,144
Hell no.
My werther's, my choice.

414
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:46,690
Yeah, yeah,
you got candy in there.

415
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:47,942
Stop showing off.

416
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:50,861
Are you choking?
Hang on, I'll save you.

417
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,947
Wait, is this irony?

418
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:56,700
Ow. Ow! Okay, I'm doing it.

419
00:17:57,954 --> 00:17:59,495
I can breathe!

420
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:01,914
Simpson,

421
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,750
Instead of mongering fear,
you mongered...

422
00:18:04,836 --> 00:18:06,836
Life itself.

423
00:18:06,963 --> 00:18:09,046
Thank you.

424
00:18:09,132 --> 00:18:11,173
This is the feeling I was after.

425
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:13,092
Not some stupid leaderboard.

426
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:14,468
I'm gonna help you
get out of here.

427
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,804
Step in my hands,
I'll boost you up.

428
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:22,268
Oh, there's so much
to grab on to.

429
00:18:24,346 --> 00:18:27,189
I'll tell everyone
you're down there.

430
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:31,235
Which will make me
alarmy number one. Suck it!

431
00:18:31,404 --> 00:18:34,029
Hairless ground hippo stuck
in sinkhole.

432
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:37,241
She's horrible.

433
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:40,828
Mom, we have one more
birthday surprise for you.

434
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:42,246
Oh. Really?

435
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:46,876
We tracked down
your best friend.

436
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:49,795
-Petey?
-Petey?

437
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:52,089
How-how is this happening?

438
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:54,091
How is this happening?!

439
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:56,218
How is this happening?!
How is this happening?!

440
00:18:56,304 --> 00:19:01,682
Aah! Get it off!
Get it off before he-- oh!

441
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:02,850
-Ew.
-Ugh.

442
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:04,768
- Ow! Ow!
- bart, do something!

443
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:07,688
Sorry.

444
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:08,981
We thought he loved you.

445
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,816
This is how he shows love.

446
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:13,194
By grooming me
and regurgitating on me.

447
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,154
I could never have friends over,

448
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,572
He was so possessive.

449
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:17,823
Mine!

450
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,668
So why did you even get him?

451
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:32,129
I didn't.
I wanted a kitten.

452
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,381
Our neighbor was
giving away their parrot.

453
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:38,552
Since petey can meow, my dad
decided he was close enough.

454
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:39,845
meow.

455
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:42,264
You're nothing like a kitten!

456
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:45,226
Don't worry, we'll
take him back to townsburg.

457
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:47,102
He's part of a wild flock there.

458
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:49,355
You went all the way
to townsburg?

459
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,815
We wanted to get
you something, you know,

460
00:19:51,943 --> 00:19:53,776
Personal for your birthday.

461
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:57,446
Yeah. We did not make friends
on the bus ride home.

462
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:59,114
Petey is kind of racist.

463
00:19:59,242 --> 00:20:02,034
Well, that's just...

464
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,410
We're sorry.

465
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,246
We didn't mean to
re-traumatize you

466
00:20:05,373 --> 00:20:07,706
With your childhood
nightmare bird.

467
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,084
My wonderful babies!

468
00:20:10,211 --> 00:20:12,544
You went to all that trouble
for me.

469
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,257
I wasn't an afterthought,
I was a thought.

470
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:19,843
Well, yeah, 'cause... You know,

471
00:20:19,971 --> 00:20:23,264
We see you as a person.

472
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:27,559
We really do.
Our favorite person.

473
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,812
Oh, that is so...

474
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,939
ow!

475
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:34,692
You little...

476
00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:38,445
Who wants to help mommy
abandon petey in townsburg?

477
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:39,822
we do!

Marge, what a beautiful robe.

483
00:20:59,969 --> 00:21:01,427
Is that terry cloth?

484
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:05,055
French terry, from the terry
province of France.

485
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:08,517
My kids got it for me.

486
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:11,687
I just threw it on to see
what that noise was.

487
00:21:11,814 --> 00:21:14,815
I think it came from over there.

488
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,359
Look at the fullness
in that sleeve.

489
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:20,571
What was that sound?
I don't see anything.

490
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:24,074
Well, it's a mystery.
We may never know.

491
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:25,826
-Look at how it moves.
-Poetry in fabric.

492
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,119
You better work.

493
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,875
Mission accomplished. Over.

494
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:34,793
roger that. Over.

00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:37,004
Shh!
