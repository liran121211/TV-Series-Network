00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:09,968
<i> attention, shoppers,</i>
<i> a mother's love is forever,</i>

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,303
<i> But mother's love rat poison</i>

3
00:00:11,305 --> 00:00:13,513
<i> Is only on sale</i>
<i> till the end of the day.</i>

4
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:16,641
Aw.

5
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:23,190
Mommy! I was waiting
by the window.

6
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:25,025
Can I carry the bag
with the milks?

7
00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:26,902
I'm really strong.

8
00:00:28,947 --> 00:00:30,614
I drew you picture.

9
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:32,157
Yes, she did.

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,701
She drew it in pudding.

11
00:00:34,703 --> 00:00:36,912
oh. Pretty.

12
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:38,580
But we should clean that up.

13
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:40,040
No!

14
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:41,416
-No, no, no!
-Fine, fine, fine.

15
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:42,751
-Pudding mommy can stay.
-No kill pudding mommy!

16
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:45,504
You should've seen when I ate
part of ketchup daddy.

17
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:46,505
no!

18
00:00:46,507 --> 00:00:48,423
Look what I got.

19
00:00:49,468 --> 00:00:52,094
Oh, I love you,
love you, love you.

20
00:00:52,096 --> 00:00:54,513
Oh, let's play bubbles now.

21
00:00:57,184 --> 00:00:59,893
This is a perfect moment.

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,940
Marge, what's wrong?

23
00:01:04,942 --> 00:01:08,026
It... It's slipping away.

24
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:09,727
You need to stop that.

25
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:11,738
W-what did you say?

26
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,823
Bart!

27
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:14,908
- Whee! I'm flying!
- Ah!

28
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,036
Bart! Bart!
W-what is happening?

29
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,706
No!

30
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:22,707
Oh!

31
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:24,584
Oh.

32
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:27,003
Oh, no. He popped.

33
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:30,090
No, no! Don't sue me, dracula!

34
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:32,759
did you say something?

35
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:34,136
Oh, I-I was dreaming about

36
00:01:34,138 --> 00:01:35,387
Those bubble parties

37
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:37,472
We used to have with the kids.

38
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:39,474
But I was so sad.

39
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:41,143
Why were you sad?

40
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:43,812
Because I knew it was gonna end.

41
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:47,732
I get it. That's why, for me,

42
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:50,986
The last foot
of a six-foot party sub is...

43
00:01:50,988 --> 00:01:52,237
Bittersweet.

44
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,115
honey, you're drenched!

45
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:57,325
it's bubble juice.

46
00:01:57,327 --> 00:02:00,412
Oh, honey,
you don't look so good.

47
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:02,205
I mean, I think you look great,

48
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:04,457
But someone else, say, a doctor,

49
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,918
Might be alarmed
at your pale skin

50
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,129
That is both hot and cold.

51
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:13,258
Why did we eat at Tuesday
o'fridayhan's last night?

52
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,179
I had three
glasses of froz-sé.

53
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:19,806
And a couple froz-oody marys.

54
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:22,017
we got pretty hammered.

55
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:24,186
Ugh. And then we bought hot dogs

56
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:26,396
From that sketchy street vendor.

57
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:29,399
Oh, but they smelled so good.

58
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:31,276
-Wrapped in bacon...
-Hmm?

59
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:32,777
...Sizzling in that hubcap...

60
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:34,070
Oh.

61
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:40,785
-Ugh.
-Homer, don't listen.

62
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:43,914
We have to keep the--

63
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,208
Romance alive!

64
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:50,670
I wonder why
you didn't get sick.

65
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:54,007
The clinical term is:
I'm all throwed up.

66
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:55,425
Should we call dr. Hibbert?

67
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:59,638
No, no, I-I'm good now,
it's all gone.

68
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,056
All better.

69
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:02,974
Ooh, bounce-a-thon is tomorrow.

70
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:04,309
I don't think
you're gonna make it.

71
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:06,269
I'll call the school
in the morning.

72
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:09,147
I have to go.

73
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:11,107
I volunteered for three jobs

74
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:14,110
On pta-martyr.Com.

75
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:17,781
Frickin' pta-martyr.Com.

76
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,701
Where is he?

77
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:22,827
Peek-a-boo!

78
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,371
oh.

79
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:27,207
Where is he?

80
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,542
Where's my special little guy?

81
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:31,836
Bart? Where are you?

82
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:33,421
don't let go.

83
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:35,715
Hmm?

84
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,427
It's okay.

85
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:44,683
Your coat.

86
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:47,435
bart?

87
00:03:49,106 --> 00:03:50,730
Can somebody help me?

88
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:52,357
I've lost my little boy.

89
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:53,733
Bart!

90
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:55,777
Oh no. I was just about to beat

91
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:57,487
These mutant houseflies
at tennis.

92
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:58,780
What do you want?

93
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:01,658
I've lost my-my little boy.

94
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,743
<i> you know this is</i>
<i> a dream, right?</i>

95
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:07,122
bee-eer-err.

96
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:09,374
Well, that would explain a lot.

97
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:10,875
yeah, in the waking world,

98
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:12,335
I'm not great at didgeridoo.

99
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:14,129
Is this one of those dreams

100
00:04:14,131 --> 00:04:16,172
Where you know you're dreaming?

101
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:19,092
There's a name for it,
somebody once told me...

102
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:20,760
I'm the one who told you.

103
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:22,137
That's right.

104
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,014
I'm your inner lisa.

105
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:27,058
I remember everything
lisa ever said to you.

106
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,436
Exactly the way you heard it.

107
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:32,105
Really? So you can tell me
what lisa said

108
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:34,274
About dreaming when you know
you're dreaming?

109
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:38,603
Yep. It's a scientifical
concept called "lucy dreaming."

110
00:04:38,605 --> 00:04:42,198
It was invented by sleep doctors
from a country somewhere.

111
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,118
Wow. She's as smart
as old sheldon.

112
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,287
Since this is your lucy dream,

113
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:50,206
You control everything
that happens.

114
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,209
So I'm the one making
homer an otter?

115
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:56,338
Yes. He appears in many forms
in your dreams.

116
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,923
Dad's an otter because yesterday

117
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:00,342
He was lying in a kiddie pool,

118
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:02,302
Eating nachos off his belly.

119
00:05:02,304 --> 00:05:04,929
It's a table
that's always with me.

120
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:06,264
sometimes dad's a clown,

121
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:07,932
Sometimes a potato,

122
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:09,809
Sometimes a clown-potato.

123
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:13,104
And sometimes, he's both
of the property brothers.

124
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:14,689
-Why am I these guys?
-Why am I these guys?

125
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:16,691
Never mind, I know why.

126
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:19,986
But why am I having
nightmares about bart?

127
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,363
Did something happen?

128
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:23,573
How do I look
at recent memories?

129
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:25,492
It's your lucy dream,
you decide.

130
00:05:25,494 --> 00:05:28,578
Oh. So I can decide that
all my thoughts from yesterday

131
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,706
Are stored in,
I don't know, the oven?

132
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,874
Sure, why not?

133
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:34,167
Hmm.

134
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,840
hmm. Here we go.

135
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:42,675
mom! Come quick!

136
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:43,843
whoa!

137
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:46,179
I'm here. I'm here, bart.
What happened?

138
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:48,807
-Splinter.
-Oh. That's it?

139
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:50,475
It's kind of bleeding.

140
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:51,601
Maybe not.

141
00:05:51,603 --> 00:05:54,687
when did your hands
get so big?

142
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,314
They're bigger than mine.

143
00:05:56,316 --> 00:05:58,817
I dunno. Maybe I got
freaky-big hands.

144
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:00,443
Tweeze, please.

145
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:06,658
I guess it's been a while
since we held hands.

146
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,034
Ew. Did you get it?

147
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:10,036
-Hmm.
-Thanks.

148
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:12,539
So that's why
you're having nightmares.

149
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,500
Bart is super rude
and full of splinters.

150
00:06:15,502 --> 00:06:19,879
Maybe. Or maybe I'm just
sick off hubcap hotdogs.

151
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:22,173
Why would awake-me eat those?

152
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:24,426
That doesn't seem like awake-me.

153
00:06:24,428 --> 00:06:27,554
After enough booze slushies,
you think you can do anything.

154
00:06:27,556 --> 00:06:30,098
I challenged the valet
to an arm wrestle,

155
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,143
But he turned out
to be just a sign.

156
00:06:33,145 --> 00:06:35,437
Why was I drinking frozen wine

157
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,814
In a casual dining
chain restaurant

158
00:06:37,816 --> 00:06:39,107
On a school night?

159
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:41,234
I dunno. After our meeting
with bart's teacher,

160
00:06:41,236 --> 00:06:42,819
You said you needed a drink.

161
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:44,070
Hmm.

162
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:46,448
Hmm...

163
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:48,825
Whoa!

164
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:50,410
Look, whatever bart did,

165
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:52,996
We'll pay to have it
cleaned or replaced

166
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:54,956
Or for its therapy or--

167
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,291
Bart hasn't done anything.

168
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:57,667
I'm meeting with
all the parents.

169
00:06:57,669 --> 00:06:59,377
Even the normal kids. Oh!

170
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:00,670
Bart is normal.

171
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:03,798
I-I mean, we don't say normal
anymore, I mean--

172
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,258
I-I'm talking
to all the parents.

173
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,927
You're not special.
I-I mean, you are, but--

174
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,345
What did you want to talk about?

175
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:11,556
As you know, bounce-a-thon means

176
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:14,058
We're getting close
to the end of the year.

177
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,060
So it's a good time
to talk about

178
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:17,979
The transition to fifth grade.

179
00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:20,273
You know, last year
of elementary school

180
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:21,816
And then it's on
to middle school and then--

181
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:24,235
Middle school?

182
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:26,362
Then everything changes:

183
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:30,408
Girls, acne, drugs, body odor.

184
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,368
Listen, I've taught fifth grade.

185
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,370
Please buy your
fifth-grader deodorant.

186
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:38,416
Like, real deodorant,
not the "natural" stuff.

187
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:41,336
They may look like children,
but they smell...

188
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:44,672
Like nervous cab-drivers.

189
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:47,175
The point is: Don't freak out.

190
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:49,511
Okay. About what?

191
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:51,095
Well, some parents
start thinking,

192
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:54,516
"oh no. This is the end
of my kid's childhood."

193
00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:57,727
But fifth grade isn't the end
of bart's childhood, right?

194
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,980
I mean, technically,
it is the last year of it.

195
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,945
Did you find out
what happened to bart?

196
00:08:06,947 --> 00:08:09,197
It's what's going to happen.

197
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,282
He's going to grow up.

198
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:12,325
Mm.

199
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,577
Damn kid.

200
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,750
It was such a strange dream.

201
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:22,043
Bart was four

202
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:24,128
And he was so adorable.

203
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,922
I'd almost forgotten
there was a time

204
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:27,715
When bart was the sweet one,

205
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:29,842
And lisa was the difficult one.

206
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:31,261
uh, to be fair...

207
00:08:31,263 --> 00:08:32,679
I'm only 18 months old,

208
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:35,265
So to be going through
my terrible twos now

209
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:37,559
Is actually pretty advanced.

210
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:40,228
Crap, I'm still dreaming!

211
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,189
bounce-a-thon!

212
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:46,317
I'm coming, too!

213
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:47,735
- yay!
- aren't you sick?

214
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:48,945
I thought I heard you barfing.

215
00:08:48,947 --> 00:08:51,114
No, that wasn't barfing.

216
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:55,368
That was... Loud,
sloshy burps--

217
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,202
ugh.

218
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:57,620
I signed up for snack,

219
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:59,622
So I have to make
marshmallow trea--

220
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:01,749
I can do this.

221
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:03,835
Just have to melt
some margari--

222
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:06,337
Don't worry.
Super-dad is already

223
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:08,089
Making the marshmallow treats.

224
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:11,467
Which krispies did you use?
Rice or cocoa?

225
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:15,263
I'm making my own. The rice
is krispying as we speak.

226
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:18,891
oh, it smells
like you've burnt it!

227
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:22,437
No problem, I'll moisten it
with the last of the eggnog.

228
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:29,110
I'm throwing up stuff
I ate years ago.

229
00:09:29,112 --> 00:09:31,237
I think I saw wedding cake.

230
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:33,239
You really should stay home.

231
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:35,617
Oh, maybe you're right.

232
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:38,995
This will be the first
bounce-a-thon I've ever missed.

233
00:09:38,997 --> 00:09:41,039
Oh, missing stuff
is the greatest.

234
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,415
When I do stuff,

235
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,834
I have a fear of missing out
on missing out.

236
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:46,753
You know:
Fo-moo-mo.

237
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:49,339
Homer, listen, you have
to do this for me.

238
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:51,341
Take a picture of each kid

239
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:54,010
Giving a thumbs-up
at the finish line.

240
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:55,595
It's for my scrapbook.

241
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:58,556
I've already made windows
for each school year.

242
00:09:58,558 --> 00:10:02,602
bart,
thumbs-up slowly past daddy.

243
00:10:02,604 --> 00:10:03,853
Give him time to focus.

244
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:08,107
Mom, there's no easy way
to tell you this,

245
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:09,817
So I'm just gonna say it.

246
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:12,820
At school, I'm becoming known
for taking cutting-edge,

247
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:14,697
No-holds-barred comedy photos.

248
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:15,990
It's true.

249
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:18,368
I've heard fifth graders say so.

250
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,703
So, w-what are you saying?

251
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:23,873
There's no way I can do
a thumbs-up at bounce-a-thon.

252
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,042
-What?
-It will ruin the brand

253
00:10:26,044 --> 00:10:28,169
I've been building
since picture day.

254
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:30,838
My fans expect me to top
inside-out eyelids

255
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,298
And scotch tape nose.

256
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,175
You don't understand
the pressure I'm under.

257
00:10:34,177 --> 00:10:36,469
But this is for
the bounce-a-thon album.

258
00:10:36,471 --> 00:10:39,263
So you'll always
remember bounce-a-thon.

259
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:42,308
But I don't even
like bounce-a-thon.

260
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,687
I'm making fun of bounce-a-thon.

261
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:46,896
What?

262
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:49,482
None of us kids
like bounce-a-thon.

263
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:51,109
It's not very cool.

264
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:54,612
Well, you thought
it was cool last year.

265
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:58,449
Bart, just one thumbs-up,
please?

266
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:01,369
I'm sorry, but no.

267
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:03,705
Crazy pictures is my thing now.

268
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:07,291
You should respect that this
is just how I am this year.

269
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:11,212
Bart, you sound so mature
and grown up.

270
00:11:11,214 --> 00:11:13,923
I hate that.

271
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:22,932
Run!

272
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:24,475
Something's coming!

273
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:29,814
This is silly.
I don't need symbolism.

274
00:11:29,816 --> 00:11:31,357
I know what I'm afraid of.

275
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:33,943
And it's not a bear. Sorry.

276
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:39,157
it's not a nightmare.

277
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,491
It's reality.

278
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:41,993
Bart's growing up.

279
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:44,036
I should've treasured every time

280
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:46,289
He held my hand because...

281
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,833
I don't remember
when he stopped.

282
00:11:48,835 --> 00:11:52,170
The poet kahlil gibran
once said:

283
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:55,548
Parents are bows...

284
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,800
Like bow-and-arrow bows?

285
00:11:57,802 --> 00:12:02,847
...From which children are
shot forth as an arrow-thingy.

286
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:05,224
The bow doesn't feel sad
when it sees

287
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:07,810
How far and true
the arrow flies.

288
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:10,813
Well, the bow feels
a little sad.

289
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:12,774
The bow doesn't
want to lose touch

290
00:12:12,776 --> 00:12:16,569
And the arrow has never been
great about answering texts.

291
00:12:17,864 --> 00:12:19,489
But even after bart grows up,

292
00:12:19,491 --> 00:12:21,407
You'll still have lisa
and maggie...

293
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:24,827
Oh, my god. Lisa and maggie!

294
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:27,330
It's going to happen
with all of them!

295
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:28,414
Oops.

296
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:32,001
Bart is just the beginning.

297
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:36,881
One by one...

298
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:39,675
...All my babies

299
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:41,010
Will leave the nest.

300
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:45,765
I'm going to lose all of them.

301
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:47,642
♪

302
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:58,569
Honey, we mustn't break
awake-you's brain.

303
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:00,822
Remember those commercials
where they show you

304
00:13:00,824 --> 00:13:02,406
What depression is like?

305
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:04,992
A raincloud
follows you everywhere,

306
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:06,911
You get sucked into sofas,

307
00:13:06,913 --> 00:13:08,371
And when it gets really bad,

308
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:11,040
Your wind-up monkey
stops clapping.

309
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:12,917
look!

310
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,836
Look, bart's at a playground!

311
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:16,420
Bart! Bart!
They have your favorite

312
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:18,381
Back-and-forth riding-thingy!

313
00:13:18,383 --> 00:13:21,467
The duck, bart! Ride the duck!

314
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:22,760
Bart!

315
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,223
No!

316
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:33,187
Okay, maybe I am being
a teensy bit negative.

317
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:39,694
okay.

318
00:13:39,696 --> 00:13:41,487
A little brain-hurricane.

319
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:45,616
My time as a mom will
eventually come to an end.

320
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:49,662
I'll have to fill my days
with a bunch of stupid hobbies.

321
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:52,707
I don't want an etsy storefront!

322
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:54,458
It's not happening now.

323
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,044
So it's silly
to be sad about it now.

324
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:59,672
It's like going to work on time.

325
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:01,841
There's no point.

326
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:03,634
I want to show you something.

327
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:10,224
Whoa!

328
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:13,060
I'm coming, too.

329
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:14,312
- yay!
- aren't you sick?

330
00:14:14,314 --> 00:14:15,938
I thought I heard you barfing.

331
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,231
Freeze it right there.

332
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:21,569
Now, watch it again
but this time look over...

333
00:14:21,571 --> 00:14:22,236
Here.

334
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:25,865
I'm coming, too.

335
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:26,824

340
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:35,875
She's rehearsing her thumbs-up.

341
00:14:35,877 --> 00:14:37,001
Oh.

342
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:38,336
Oh, I was so sad

343
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:40,254
That bart had outgrown
the bounce-a-thon,

344
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:43,883
I couldn't see that
my sweet lisa still loves it.

345
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:45,051
For now.

346
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:47,303
Next year, she'll probably
turn on it, too.

347
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:48,554
Ma'am, I'm gonna
have to ask you

348
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:50,765
To get out of
the dark place, please.

349
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:51,557
You're right.

350
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:54,727
Bounce-a-thon
still means a lot to lisa.

351
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:58,230
So, what are you--
like, my feelings police?

352
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:01,150
No, I'm pretty sure I'm here
because, deep down,

353
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:02,526
You're attracted to me.

354
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:05,196
The uniform,
the low center of gravity,

355
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:07,740
My thick, syrupy voice.

356
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:09,367
I don't think so.

357
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:11,035
If anything, I'm into eddie.

358
00:15:11,037 --> 00:15:13,663
Yeah, he's a beautiful man.

359
00:15:13,665 --> 00:15:18,084
I love that lisa was so happy
I was gonna be there.

360
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:20,002
I should be there for her.

361
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:22,171
I've got to get
to the bounce-a-thon

362
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:24,632
Before lisa's childhood
slips away.

363
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:26,717
How can I wake myself up?

364
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,594
Oh. Well, this'll do it.

365
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:36,602
Okay, looking good,
feeling good.

366
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,358
Even better now.

367
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:45,820
I'll be there, lisa,
I won't miss it.

368
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:47,697
<i> or a pickle and egg sandwich</i>

369
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,658
<i> From joey mayonnaise's</i>
<i> sandwich creamery!</i>

370
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,495
<i> Where the hospitality is</i>
<i> as warm as the mayonnai--</i>

371
00:15:58,251 --> 00:16:00,876
Okay, I ruined the car.

372
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,671
But mommy's
s-still coming, lisa.

373
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:07,133
Okay, here we go.

374
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:11,679
Oh, I got to sign up.
Okay. Username?

375
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:13,681
Uh, bounce-mom.

376
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:15,558
Taken. Fine.

377
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,435
Uh, barf-mom.

378
00:16:17,437 --> 00:16:18,978
Taken? Really?

379
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,063
Borf-mom.

380
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:23,315
What? Oh, come on.

381
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,900
Marge.

382
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,736
Oh, that worked.

383
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:41,584
Ah!

384
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:43,210
I'm here, lisa.

385
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:48,424
I promised to wear this, uh,
humorous wig for bounce-a-thon

386
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:50,843
If we had 30 lice-free days
and, uh, well,

387
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:53,637
We had 29, but I'm just
going to assume that today

388
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,930
Is going to go well.

389
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:57,058
And on the bounce track
right now,

390
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,976
The second grade.

391
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:01,228
that's lisa's class.

392
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:05,941
Excuse me, excuse me.
Let me through.

393
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:08,069
I'm here to support my child.

394
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:10,446
Yeah, well, guess what,
princess blue,

395
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:13,240
We're all here
to support our kids.

396
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:16,160
So stick that in your g-string
and make change.

397
00:17:16,162 --> 00:17:19,121
I'm sorry, I'm very, very sick
and I just--

398
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:21,373
Sick? W-what kind of sick?

399
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,001
I don't know. Some kind of, um,

400
00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:26,754
I don't know, pox or plague.

401
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,970
Oh, no. Food smells.

402
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,806
It's okay,
I'll just hold my breath.

403
00:17:45,024 --> 00:17:48,150
Must... Get... Picture.

404
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,783
mrs. Simpson?

405
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:59,328
D-did I get the picture?

406
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:05,376
I took a photo
after I passed out?

407
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:09,380
Yeah, we had to pry the phone
from your hand.

408
00:18:09,382 --> 00:18:11,674
I've been kind of a wreck
since our meeting.

409
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:15,094
You know, when you said
bart's childhood is over?

410
00:18:15,096 --> 00:18:18,931
I did not say that.
I would never say that.

411
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,392
Bart's childhood isn't over.

412
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:24,103
I did notice
that you got very quiet

413
00:18:24,105 --> 00:18:26,313
After I mentioned middle school.

414
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:28,315
You didn't say anything else.

415
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:31,694
Except to ask about happy hour
at Tuesday o'fridayhan's.

416
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:34,738
Wait, you didn't say
he was heading toward

417
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,991
Girls and drugs and acne?

418
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:39,702
No, of course not.

419
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:41,537
Oh, my gosh, that was a dream.

420
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:44,957
I should have noticed
that you were 17 feet tall.

421
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:48,252
I ate bad things last night.

422
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:51,338
You didn't say we had to
buy bart deodorant next year.

423
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,840
Oh, no, no, no, I did say that.

424
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:54,925
That part is very important.

425
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:57,344
Strong deodorant.

426
00:18:57,346 --> 00:19:00,973
Hey, bart's got
a lot of childhood left.

427
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:03,893
I mean, he scores
in the 50th percentile

428
00:19:03,895 --> 00:19:05,102
For knowing his right and left,

429
00:19:05,104 --> 00:19:07,188
Which is, oh, not a test score

430
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,565
I should have said out loud
at a school function.

431
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:12,735
Are you going to be okay?

432
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:15,404
Yes. I'm just going to lie here

433
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:18,824
Until the school
stops spinning...

434
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,744
Ah.

435
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:23,037
Feeling better?

436
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,705
Mm-hmm.

437
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:26,040
I missed the picture,

438
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:29,210
But lisa was so happy
to see me today.

439
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:31,462
So, for now, I'm happy.

440
00:19:31,464 --> 00:19:33,339
And who knows
what the future holds?

441
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:35,341
Bart could knock up
his high school girlfriend.

442
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:36,550
You could have grandchildren

443
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,802
Before maggie
starts kindergarten.

444
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:41,180
Wouldn't that be nice?

445
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:46,268
time to wake up.

446
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:50,397
oh.

447
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:53,692
Here he comes.

448
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:57,696
Mm. My funny little guy.

449
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:04,495
Oh...

450
00:20:04,497 --> 00:20:06,956
that's...

451
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,458
That's really good.

452
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,670
did you
get the picture?

453
00:20:12,672 --> 00:20:14,046
Was my crack centered?

454
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:17,007
Oh, bart, it was perfect.

455
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:18,467
You liked it?

456
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:20,427
I loved it.

457
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,596
Thanks. Wanna go
to the dunk tank?

458
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:24,765
The gym teacher I hate
is on the chair.

459
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:26,600
Sure.

460
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:33,190
Let's dunk that sucker.

461
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:37,903
And on the way home,

462
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,571
Let's go deodorant shopping.
