1
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:20,771
Finally, a galaxy
without trolls.

2
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:22,147
Huh?

3
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,826
Your reign of muscly heroism

4
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:37,454
Ends here, flexulon.

5
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:47,005
Soar high, my golden friend.

6
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:50,383
For today, we die another day.

7
00:00:56,975 --> 00:00:59,309
next stop,

8
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:02,854
The dank sticky jungles
of bong-ulon five.

9
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:06,817
Dude, you shouldn't have
let him eat

10
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:08,985
That whole pan of acid brownies.

11
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:11,446
In my defense,
I-I thought it'd be cool,

12
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:14,449
And I was right.

13
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,996
So, since otto has disappeared
with our bus

14
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:21,832
And our brownie pans,

15
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:24,543
Parents will have to drive
their own children to school.

16
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:30,090
Well, fewer of you
would have to drive

17
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:32,843
If you sat down and arranged
a carpool schedule.

18
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:36,096
I'll kill you!

19
00:01:36,098 --> 00:01:37,973
Or your children could walk
to school

20
00:01:37,975 --> 00:01:40,016
So none of you
have to do anything.

21
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:43,270
Walking it is.

22
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:45,814
However, we do need
one parent volunteer

23
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:47,149
To complete our team of

24
00:01:47,151 --> 00:01:48,984
Noble crossing guards.

25
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:53,280
Just, uh, one engaged parent
is all we need.

26
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,075
Hell yeah! You know I'm in.

27
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:58,577
I've been waiting for this
my whole life.

28
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:01,163
Homer simpson. Wonderful.

29
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:02,789
Hmm? What'd he say?

30
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,709
I was watching the trailer for
the<i> revenge of the nerds</i> reboot.

31
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:07,919
John cena is playing booger.

32
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:11,464
Homer, you just volunteered.

33
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:13,550
Dear god.

34
00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:15,343
No. Stop. Yield.

35
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:18,889
Well, he's got the lingo down.
This guy's a natural.

36
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:20,974
Now I got to wake up

37
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:22,642
At the butt-crack of dawn

38
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:25,812
To walk loser kids
across some loser street.

39
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:28,607
never have children, lenny.

40
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:31,109
you don't have to
worry about that.

41
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:33,320
See, I was born without...

42
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:36,489
What the...? We've got a code
blue in 7-g. Repeat, code blue.

43
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:40,410
anyhoo,

44
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:43,205
You notice there's an apple
for sale in the vending machine?

45
00:02:43,207 --> 00:02:45,874
I mean,
who would buy that?

46
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:50,503
-Double the coolant levels, now.
-I'm on it.

47
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:52,088
Backup pumps on standby.

48
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,673
Carlson, decrease
the steam valves by 60p.

49
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:55,842
Leonard, the control rods.

50
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:58,220
You, glasses,
pray for all our souls.

51
00:02:58,222 --> 00:03:00,805
Now, switch generators
on my count.

52
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:02,265
Five.

53
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:03,308
Four.

54
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,644
Three.

55
00:03:05,646 --> 00:03:07,520
Two.

56
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,606
Implement.

57
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:16,363
-We did it!
-Boolah, boolah.

58
00:03:16,365 --> 00:03:17,530
um, fellas?

59
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:21,493
I'm the nuclear safety guy,
right?

60
00:03:21,495 --> 00:03:25,330
Shouldn't my console have been
doing all that beepy stuff?

61
00:03:25,332 --> 00:03:28,291
- Yeah, um, uh...
- uh, you see...

62
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:30,752
We kind of made it so that
just my console does that now.

63
00:03:30,754 --> 00:03:34,673
We just figured
we'd lighten your load, buddy,

64
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:36,591
Since you already do so much.

65
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:37,676
Like the March madness brackets.

66
00:03:37,678 --> 00:03:40,971
And you're the go-getter
who implemented

67
00:03:40,973 --> 00:03:41,721
Jean-short wednesdays.

68
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,383
Are you guys saying

69
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:47,727
I've never kept anyone safe?

70
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:51,439
Oh, sure you have, homer.
Just... By not doing anything.

71
00:03:57,906 --> 00:04:00,073
My console isn't even
plugged in.

72
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:02,659
I opened it, and it's full
of cleaning supplies

73
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:05,453
And unsold mr. Burns funkos.

74
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:08,665
this whole time
I thought I mattered,

75
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,834
But I don't and I never did.

76
00:04:10,836 --> 00:04:11,918
Well, you matter to me,

77
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,297
Especially since
it's Wednesday night.

78
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,634
Oh. Right. Scheduled sex.

79
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:24,472
okay, here we go...

80
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:27,309
- Just give me a second here.
- come on, just...

81
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:30,186
Almost... um...

82
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:31,813
uh, sweetie?

83
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:35,108
It seems like your light saber
doesn't want to go "shwoom."

84
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,902
Did you go "han solo"
earlier tonight?

85
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:40,905
I guess
I'm useless everywhere.

86
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:42,532
I'm just gonna
stay in bed tomorrow

87
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:45,535
And suck my nightstand
ketchup packets.

88
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,581
Actually, you have to
wake up at 6:00

89
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,332
To be a crossing guard.

90
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:52,083
D'oh!

91
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:54,669
What do you guys think
happened to otto?

92
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:55,795
-Jail.
-Jail.

93
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:57,839
-Jail.
-Maybe he just got tired

94
00:04:57,841 --> 00:04:59,799
Of always running
from the darkness.

95
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:02,969
Oh, god, there's dad.

96
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:05,472
Please don't let him
embarrass us.

97
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:06,973
Well, well,

98
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:10,685
Time to help the baby brigade
cross the road.

99
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,272
oh, no.

100
00:05:14,274 --> 00:05:17,776
I deserve your respect,

101
00:05:17,778 --> 00:05:19,694
You little jerks.

102
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:22,572
Stupid kids. Without me,

103
00:05:22,574 --> 00:05:25,742
They'd be stuck
on one side of the street

104
00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:27,452
For the rest of their lives.

105
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:30,163
Haw-haw!
Got your octagonal sign.

106
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:32,165
Hey, give me that!

107
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,501
I need it to tell cars
what to do. Stop!

108
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:36,169
No, you stop.

109
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:38,254
d'oh!

110
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:45,011
I'm a streetwalker.

111
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:49,682
Oh, no. I'm late
for my aa meeting.

112
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:53,228
Hey there, gorgeous.

113
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:54,604
Hmm?

114
00:06:00,103 --> 00:06:01,528
whoa.

115
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,197
My whole life just flashed
through my pants.

116
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,782
Way to go, homer!

117
00:06:05,784 --> 00:06:08,535
You just saved this
balding little scamp's life.

118
00:06:08,537 --> 00:06:11,329
-All right, homer.
-You did it, dad!

119
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:13,540
How about one
for the paper, mr. S.

120
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:16,668
I saved someone's life.

121
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,502
You hear that, world?

122
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:20,088
Homer simpson matters!

123
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:24,175
Oh, right.
How about one of these?

124
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:26,594
-Whoo.
-Whee!

125
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,642
The last two endangered pandas

126
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:35,520
On earth died today

127
00:06:35,522 --> 00:06:37,480
In what zoo investigators are
calling a grisly murder-suicide.

128
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:40,608
<i> Adios, pandas. We'll see you</i>
<i> at the crossroads.</i>

129
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,319
We wrap up tonight's
nightly reading of horrors

130
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:45,780
With a new optimistic segment
I like to call

131
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:47,782
<i> "chicken soup for the news."</i>

132
00:06:47,784 --> 00:06:50,243
<i> The small-town crossing guard.</i>

133
00:06:51,872 --> 00:06:54,914
<i> A job most americans consider</i>
<i>as charming as it is pointless.</i>

134
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,207
<i> Until last week,</i>

135
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:59,335
<i> When local hero homer simpson</i>
<i> risked his life</i>

136
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:01,379
<i> To save one pumpkin-headed</i>
<i> little boy.</i>

137
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:04,215
<i> And now,</i>
<i> simpson has become something</i>

138
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:05,675
<i> Of a curbside celebrity.</i>

139
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:09,345
What can springfield do to show
its love and appreciation

140
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:11,055
For local crossing guards?

141
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:13,850
I don't know. I guess we could
use some new equipment.

142
00:07:13,852 --> 00:07:15,685
These lawn chairs
aren't very comfy

143
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:18,605
And these old sashes don't
exactly "lift and support."

144
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:19,564
But you know what, kent?

145
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:22,859
Keeping kids safe
is its own reward.

146
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:25,570
God bless that
saintly doughball.

147
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:27,989
That's it, I'm giving
springfield's crossing guards

148
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:29,407
An actual budget.

149
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:32,327
Not for self-serving
political reasons,

150
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:33,369
But because I'm a man
of principle

151
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:35,538
Who wants to do good
in the world.

152
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,374
Joseph, your turn
on the sex chess board.

153
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:41,169
We can't very well play
without our king.

154
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:44,672
Though the bishop may try.

155
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:46,633
♪

156
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:52,222
Wow, look at all
this orange swag.

157
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:55,016
And that's just the beginning.

158
00:07:55,018 --> 00:07:57,060
Now you'll be getting
a full-time salary.

159
00:07:57,062 --> 00:07:59,354
Ah, sweet cellophane sally.

160
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:01,147
First, I get paid
to be the timer

161
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:03,650
At a chess-themed sex orgy,
and now this.

162
00:08:03,652 --> 00:08:06,402
Homer, as the fella
whose heroism got us here,

163
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:09,739
I nominate you
as crossing guard captain.

164
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:15,411
ooh.

165
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:18,206
Look at my handsome man
in uniform.

166
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,791
I don't know, homer.

167
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:22,835
The only people that wear badges
are power-hungry chumps

168
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:25,171
Who want to keep
the little guy down.

169
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:26,005
Are you talking about
that security guard

170
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,340
At the supermarket?

171
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:30,468
I wasn't trying to break
the gumball machine.

172
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,762
I was just trying
to shake out a purple.

173
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:33,805
Well, I'm proud of you, dad.

174
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:36,057
Volunteering to serve
the community

175
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,059
Is the highest calling there is.

176
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:39,352
You know what's even better?

177
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:42,272
Volunteering for money.
We're getting paid now.

178
00:08:42,274 --> 00:08:45,608
I even got a budget
for ten more guards.

179
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,611
And I'm only gonna hire
the best and the brightest.

180
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,029
All right, rookies.

181
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:52,949
Not all of you are going to
make it through training.

182
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:55,326
Look to your left,
now look to your right.

183
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:58,329
That's how you know
if a car is coming.

184
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:00,331
That concludes your training.

185
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,167
Heya, homer.
I-I can't thank you enough

186
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:04,168
For saving my ralphy's life.

187
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,089
Of course, chief.
Just doing my job.

188
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:09,924
If you ever need
a parking ticket thrown out

189
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:12,802
Or someone else's dna left
somewhere, you just let me know.

190
00:09:14,848 --> 00:09:16,472
Yarr, captain.

191
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:19,809
He didn't seek your permission
to cross the seven stripes.

192
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:21,269
Crossing guard stu

193
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:24,105
Thinks he's undermining you.

194
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:26,524
Where's the fire, buddy?

195
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:28,401
Do you know how jay you were
walking there, sir?

196
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:30,570
I-I-I don't know
what that means.

197
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:32,322
All right, wise guy,
I'm gonna have to ask you

198
00:09:32,324 --> 00:09:33,489
To step out of the curb.

199
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:34,490
And keep your feet
where I can see them.

200
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:37,410
I can't even see them.

201
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:38,661
Sir, calm down.

202
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:40,204
Look, I can let you off
with a warning this time,

203
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:44,125
But just so you know,
I run these streets.

204
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:46,502
I-- what? No, you don't, I do.

205
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:49,130
Well, I run all the parts
between the curbs. Got it?

206
00:09:49,132 --> 00:09:51,007
Ooh, these are nice.

207
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:52,467
I'm gonna hold onto them,

208
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:54,469
Unless you have
a problem with that?

209
00:09:54,471 --> 00:09:57,221
Yeah, no, no problem at all,
um, uh, "cross-ifer."

210
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,973
Just have-have a nice day.

211
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,642
Stupid crossing guards,

212
00:10:00,644 --> 00:10:03,770
Think they're so tough
with their cool orange vests.

213
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:06,522
Another curb kept safe

214
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:08,775
By captain
homer j. Simpson. Boys?

215
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:12,028
♪

216
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:23,081
H-here's that pitcher
you asked for, squeaky voice.

217
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,166
That's mr. Teen to you, rookie.

218
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:27,460
These new guys got no respect.

219
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:29,170
It ain't like when we started
three weeks ago.

220
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:32,423
Homer, I've been
trying to reach you.

221
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:36,260
Whoa, there, skinner. This bar
is crossing guards only now.

222
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:39,055
I don't even let lenny and carl
in here no more.

223
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,308
Yeah, but did you read
my urgent memo?

224
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,395
Tomorrow is the science fair,
bake sale, and picture day.

225
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:47,855
Morning drop-off
will be very challenging.

226
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:50,441
Now, uh, I'm not telling you
how to do your job...

227
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:52,652
Are you telling me
how to do my job?

228
00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:55,238
No, I specifically said I'm not
telling you how to do your job.

229
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,783
That's enough,
principal what's-ya-face.

230
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:00,576
No pedestrians allowed.

231
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:01,285
But, homer,

232
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:03,079
If we don't get this right,

233
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:05,748
It could be pandemonium.

234
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,417
pandemonium.

235
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:09,335
It's pandemonium, folks.
This is arnie pye,

236
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:13,464
Reporting live high above
an elementary school traffic jam

237
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:16,300
Turned all-out
scholastic fracas.

238
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:18,636
Surely this town's
handsomely paid crossing guards

239
00:11:18,638 --> 00:11:21,139
Can bring order to this
Monday morning mayhem.

240
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:23,266
oh, oh.

241
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:24,726
Guys, stop it!

242
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:35,194
The punching
is making things worse.

243
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:37,363
Don't make me blow
my whistle at you.

244
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:40,158
Captain simpson,
the shaking of my car

245
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,534
Is dangerously close to mixing

246
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:45,204
The hydrogen peroxide, yeast,
and dish soap within.

247
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:47,290
-So?
-Those ingredients create

248
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,250
A fascinating yet volatile
substance

249
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:51,294
Known as...

250
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:54,547
...Elephant toothpaste.

251
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:58,009
This was the most expensive,
destructive,

252
00:11:58,011 --> 00:12:00,720
And disgusting riot since
the isotopes won the pennant.

253
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:02,472
Go topes.

254
00:12:02,474 --> 00:12:04,390
Crossing guard captain
homer simpson,

255
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:05,767
What do you have
to say for yourself?

256
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:10,521
Um... Um...

257
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:13,316
<i> Ooh! What can I do?</i>
<i>Who can I blame? Coastal elites?</i>

258
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:16,736
<i> Avocado socialists? The boy?</i>
<i> I've got it.</i>

259
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:20,198
Mr. Mayor, the blame falls
squarely on the shoulders

260
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,910
Of the crossing guards...'s
inadequate budget.

261
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:25,453
We need more money!

262
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:27,622
More money?

263
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:31,542
More money for training,
for equipment, for overtime,

264
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,961
So that your children
can cross the street safely

265
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:35,880
At 3:00 a.M. If they want to.

266
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:41,928
Throwing money
at a deeply flawed institution

267
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,262
Is bound to work.

268
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:46,557
Um, have you all been huffing
evidence powder?

269
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,518
Homer simpson
and his chair-jockeys

270
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,103
Royally screwed the pooch
on this one.

271
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:51,979
And now you want
to give him more money?

272
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:55,107
That makes absolutely no sense.

273
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,151
Listen up, wokester.

274
00:12:57,153 --> 00:12:59,362
Guys like me
are the last line of defense

275
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:02,156
Between your school kids
and guys like me

276
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:04,075
Who text when they drive.

277
00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:06,077
And if you don't like it,

278
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,039
You can jaywalk your ass
back to portland.

279
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:11,749
Wha...?

280
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:13,918
All in favor of me

281
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,837
Pulling a political 180
on this issue

282
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,257
And giving the crossing guards
a blank check, say "aye."

283
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:21,342
- aye.
- Nay.

284
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:22,677
Somebody get
my enormous checkbook.

285
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:26,681
It worked.

286
00:13:26,683 --> 00:13:28,266
Maybe I should've asked them
for more, just in case.

287
00:13:28,268 --> 00:13:31,602
And, uh, here's some more,
just in case.

288
00:13:36,693 --> 00:13:38,401
Ooh, these beanbag bazookas

289
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:40,152
Can shatter
a minivan windshield.

290
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:43,281
and it comes
with a beanbag bandolier.

291
00:13:43,283 --> 00:13:46,158
Look at you
and your huge budget.

292
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,369
My big, strong leader
in the streets

293
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:52,123
And in the sheets--
the bedsheets.

294
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,250
I like that we kept
our sunglasses on last night.

295
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:57,169
I couldn't see a thing.

296
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,589
Wow, look at all
this cool stuff.

297
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:03,175
You are an all-powerful
crossing god.

298
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:05,428
I thought you said
badges were lame?

299
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,471
Hey, like everyone
who comes into a ton of cash,

300
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:10,391
I've flip-flopped
to the side of authority.

301
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:14,645
Oh, you're charging me,
francine?

302
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:17,064
Even though I keep your kids
safe every morning?

303
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,774
Aiden? Charlotte?

304
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,943
Nearsighted nicholas?

305
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:22,570
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's on the house.

306
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:24,697
Thank you
for your service, hero.

307
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:27,867
I don't even have kids,
but this guy scares me.

308
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:29,619
Um, dad,

309
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:33,039
I worry that this massive
increase in money and power

310
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,041
Is subtly corrupting you.

311
00:14:35,043 --> 00:14:37,418
Oh, honey, relax.

312
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,004
There's nothing subtle about it.

Mm... Simpson

And nine-figure lawsuits.

00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:34,100
Well, you could always, uh...

326
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:36,477
Decrease their budget a bit.

327

330
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:45,903
Uh, surveillance satellite.

331
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,992
Aw, geez, we wanted
one of those.

332
00:15:50,994 --> 00:15:52,118
Uh, captain simpson,

333
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,870
Your crossing guards now take up

334
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:56,497
The vast majority
of this town's budget.

335
00:15:56,499 --> 00:16:00,793
We have no choice
but to trim your budget by...

336
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:03,004
1.5 percent.

337
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:06,340
one point...

338
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:08,342
Sir, you're about to learn

339
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:10,970
The crossing guards
are uncrossable.

340
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:18,102
Where's the nice man
who helps us cross?

341
00:16:18,104 --> 00:16:20,312
I heard he lost his funding.

342
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:21,939

00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:51,427
Is it?

354
00:16:51,554 --> 00:16:53,262
Homer simpson
can bully this town,

355
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:56,515
Its citizens,
and their young children,

356
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,100
But he cannot bully me.

357
00:16:58,102 --> 00:17:01,937
Clancy, shut him down.

358
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,981
With pleasure.

359
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,276
My anti-quimby ad
got a million likes

360
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:09,862
On my "thin orange line"
facebook page.

361
00:17:09,864 --> 00:17:11,906
Look at all these
supportive comments.

362
00:17:11,908 --> 00:17:13,157
"murder quimby,"

363
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:14,200
"dismember quimby,"

364
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:17,870
"go back in time
and kill baby quimby."

365
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:19,288
Ah, the internet,

366
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,373
The marketplace of ideas.

367
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:25,169
You're endangering the lives
of public officials.

368
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:28,172
Oh, come on, I'm just slinging
a little mud.

369
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:29,799
What's the worst
that could happen?

370
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:33,469
dear god...

371
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:39,225
That chair was my best friend
on the force.

372
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:41,227
Who would dare do this?

373
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:43,145
me would dare.

374
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:46,899
When you mess with the pig,
you get the snout.

375
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,236
This is a chair too far, wiggum.

376
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:51,320
My crossing guards and your cops

377
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:54,240
Need to settle this
once and for all,

378
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:57,326
At the most dangerous place
in town.

379
00:17:57,328 --> 00:17:59,453
What, that brunchausen
by loxy place

380
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:01,664
That's been poisoning everyone
for attention?

381
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:05,543
No. The six-way intersection.

382
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:09,338
Well, well,

383
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,675
I thought cops only showed up
after something bad happens.

384
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:18,055
We are sick
of you crossing guards

385
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:20,266
And your unaccountable,
super-macho,

386
00:18:20,268 --> 00:18:23,936
Hyper-sensitive,
crazily militarized malarkey.

387
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:26,814
That's our thing, damn it.

388
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:28,899
No, that's our thing.

389
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:30,276
Who the hell are you?

390
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:32,486
We're ice.
Keeping this country safe

391
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:34,905
From cleaning ladies
and college-age dreamers.

392
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:36,657
We're america's heroes.

393
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:38,909
You wish, kid-cagers.
It's the tsa.

394
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:41,370
We keep this country safe,

395
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:44,874
One confiscated shampoo bottle
at a time.

396
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:46,208
Think again, shoe sniffers.

397
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,170
The only force
holding society together

398
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:51,505
Is america's meter maids.

399
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:53,549
And meter butlers.

400
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:57,178
No, it's us, overzealous
neighborhood watch guys

401
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,929
In right-to-carry states.

402
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:01,015
whoop. Sorry, clem.

403
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,021
You all think
you keep america safe?

404
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:08,272
how?

405
00:19:08,274 --> 00:19:11,108
By hassling grandmas
and wrecking quinceañeras?

406
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,860
By grazing my junk
with your wand?

407
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:15,779
Or arresting bank robbers

408
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,073
Who rob banks?

409
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,325
Unlike all of you,

410
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:21,994
I've earned the right
to feel godlike.

411
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:24,163
I've actually saved a life.

412
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:27,208
um, we save lives
every day, bruh.

413
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,376
Shut up, lifeguards.
This is a land argument.

414
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,754
But if the rest of you
want to get nuts,

415
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:34,006
Then come on, let's get nuts.

416
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:35,382
But mark my words,

417
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:38,052
Before you cross
the crossing guards,

418
00:19:38,054 --> 00:19:41,013
You'd better look
both way--

419
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:43,641
Hey, everybody. I'm back. I...

420
00:19:43,643 --> 00:19:44,808
Uh-oh.

421
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,939
Am I gonna go to jail now?

422
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:52,608
I wouldn't dream of it.

423
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:57,821
Well, I hope you learned
a valuable lesson, dad.

424
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,406
Absolute power...

425
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:00,991
Is the best kind
of power there is?

426
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:01,909
Is a warm beanbag bazooka?

427
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:03,953
Does bad things to society

428
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:06,205
And does strange things to me.

429
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:10,292
No. Once you militarized
the crossing guards,

430
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:13,087
They became an army
in search of an enemy.

431
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:16,090
And if the only tool
you have is a hammer,

432
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:19,051
Then everything starts
to look like a nail.

433
00:20:19,053 --> 00:20:20,928
Perhaps, but on
the other hand...

434
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,846
ugh.

435
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,223
-Mom!
-Gotcha!

436
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:26,308
Bart, say "excuse me."

437
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,019
I don't care if he says
excuse me, I want him

438
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:30,562
Not to burp in my face.

439
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:31,313
Lighten up, lis.

440
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:35,985
