Sir, we’re two minutes

at the Billionaires’
Retreat.

12
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,368
Ah, my favorite week
of the year.

13
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,621
Sophisticated
financial discussions

14
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,915
with my fellow plutocrats.

15
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:22,999
Food fight!

Take that, Ted Turner.

18
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,339
In your face,
founder of Facebook.

19
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,604
Skinny-dip!

20
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,939
Yay!

00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,053
Nice prank,
Simpson.

35
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,972
I dare you to dump
that bees’ nest

36
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,723
on those second
grade babies.

37
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,850
Why would I want to?

38
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,893
Because I said,
"I dare you."

39
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,020
Kearney, can you
read it back?

40
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,814
"Nice prank, Simpson.

41
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,315
I dare you to...

42
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,609

Jimbo: Because I said,
’I dare you.’

00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:35,989
Kearney, can you
read it back?

46
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,740
Kearney, reading:

48
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,702
The point is,
Simpson,

49
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,454
a dare has been placed
on your nards.

50
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,415
My nards accept.

51
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,335
Stingamajigs!

52
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,422
Save yourselves!

53
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,677
Huh?

54
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,970
Where are the bees?

55
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,096
No bees?

56
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,264
Dare annulled.

57
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,640
Can I appeal?

58
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,435
Yeah, appeal to other guys,
Captain Wuss!

59
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,978

Other than the birth
of my kid,

62
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,858
this is my
happiest moment.

63
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,195
All the bees are dead.

64
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,362
Aye, lass.

65
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,780
The bees are dyin’.

66
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,157
And not just here.

67
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,366
All over the world,

68
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,785
from Glasgow
clear to Edinburgh.

69
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,537

(sobbing)

73
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,513
Willie, I didn’t know
you were an apiarist.

74
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,016
From context, I can tell
that means beekeeper.

75
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,893
’Tis a tragedy, Lisa.

76
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,811
No man should
outlive his bees.

77
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,064
They’re stinging
God now.

78
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,067
(sobbing)

79
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:58,863
(crickets chriping)

80
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,913
(chuckling, spraying)

81
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,377
And the call from the SEC

82
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,214
was coming from inside
their own brokerage house.

83
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,507
(screaming)

84
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,717
Jeff Bezos
wet his pants!

85
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,718
I did not.

86
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,303
That was apple juice
from before.

87
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,931
I fold.

88
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,641
I raise a million dollars...

89
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,435
and to sweeten the pot,
my assistant, Smithers.

90
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,520
If you lose me, sir,

91
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,397
may I say what an honor
it’s been to...

92
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,564
Bets don’t talk.

93
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,400
-They see and raise.
-(groans)

94
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,447
Well, if we’re betting people,
I got a whole herd of them.

95
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,868
My professional basketball team:
the Austin Celtics.

96
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,495
(chuckling)

97
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,414
Well, they’re hardly
worth a Smithers,

98
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,498
but we don’t
have all night.

99
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,375
Can you beat nine high?

100
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,753
Damn. Eight high.

101
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,507
So, I own a basketball team,
do I?

102
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,301
Take good care
of them, Burnsie.

103
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,845
Don’t let the forwards
mix with the guards.

104
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,805
And if they’re
acting sluggish,

105
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,725
slip some steroids
into their cocaine.

106
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,684
Mm-hmm.

107
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,189
Fortune Four
lotto numbers are: nine...

108
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,316
Pfft... knew it.

109
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,817
<i>-seven...</i>
-Duh.

110
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,818
<i>-three...</i>
-What?!

111
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,778
<i>-and...</i>
-Boring.

112
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,322
Dad, we have
to do something.

113
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,865
All the bees
are dying.

114
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,159
Oh, no, no bees?

115
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,870
Ooh,
now who will sting me

116
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,872
and walk all over
my sandwiches?

117
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,249
But Dad, bees
pollinate flowers.

118
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,003
Flowers: the painted whores
of the plant world.

119
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,796
No bees means
no honey.

120
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,346
(panting)

121
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,724
Synthetic honey.

122
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,393
<i>Just like you remember.</i>

123
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,020
<i>Honey?</i>

124
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,565
Thank you.

125
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,276
(slurping loudly)

126
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,822
(Homer screaming)

127
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,199
D’oh!

128
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:10,370
I never dreamed the future
could be scary.

129
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,788
Let’s go, Lisa.

130
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,915
We’ve got
some worms to save.

131
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,625
-Bees.
-Worms, bees,
ticks, fleas.

132
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,210
Let’s go, go, go!

133
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,337
FRINK:
I’m glad you
called me.

134
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,465
I know I’m not the first
scientist in the phone book.

135
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,717
That’s Associate
Professor Aaron Ableman.

136
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,843
How I hate him.

137
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,261
(gasps)

138
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,223
Thundering thorax,
it’s just exactly what I feared!

139
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,599
Hmm.

140
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,393
In there, close.

141
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,645
See these red dots?

142
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,148
This bee has been felled
by bee measles...

143
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,734
or, as I call it, "beasles".

144
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,861
Animals can get sick?

145
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,823
-I’m going to talk
to the girl from now on.
-You’re the nerd.

146
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,741
What we need to do now is find

147
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,286
enough uninfected bees
to start a healthy colony.

148
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,996
This pheromone
should attract them.

149
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,040
(spraying)

150
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,458
Marry me,

151
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,293
and I’ll support
you for life.

152
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,420
You’re not a bee!

153
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,088
This thing is useless.

154
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,257
(gasps, grunts)

155
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,883
(gasps)
There’s one on Lisa.

156
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,427
(buzzing)

157
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,886
Hold still, sweetie.

158
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,096
Daddy will kill it.

159
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,683
And this time, no screwups.

160
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,687
Stop, stop,
it’s an uninfected queen!

161
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,148
(gasps)
How do we catch her
without hurting her?

162
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,275
Uh, unfortunately,
the best method

163
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,860
is to allow her
to sting you.

164
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,945
-(screams)
-Yeah, much like that.

165
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,865
Now squeeze around the stinger
to keep her attached,

166
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,326
and a colony of bees
will soon form around your face.

167
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,578
(buzzing)

168
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,374
Now just keep them there

169
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,169
until the colony
is healthy and thriving.

170
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,004
How long is that?

171
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,589
Long enough
that you will be known

172
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,966
as Springfield’s
crazy bee girl.

173
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,885
(laughing):
She likes the stingers.

174
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,595
(humming)

175
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,388
Marge, remember
when we were talking

176
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,432
-about our worst fears?
-Uh-huh.

177
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,559
Mine was snakes,
and yours was...

178
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,352
Never being a grandmother.

179
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,855
Really? I thought it was Lisa
with a beard of bees.

180
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,565
Well,
whatever-- brace yourself.

181
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,238
President Lincoln!

182
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,364
You’ve come back,

183
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,158
and you got rid
of that hat.

184
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,326
You’ve got my vote.

185
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,666
Lisa, I don’t like this
at all.

186
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,876
It’s not for long.

187
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,920
But until they find
a suitable habitat,

188
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,005
this beard is the only hope
for these bees.

189
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,590
Relax, Mom.

190
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,634
I’ll mold them into
a shape you know and love.

191
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,636
(buzzing)

192
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,223
Stop Milhousing your sister.

193
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,641
(chuckling)

194
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,352
Now take it off
before they sting you.

195
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,938
Actually, bees rarely sting
when they’re in a cluster.

196
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,898
They only attack
to defend their hive.

197
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,399
I don’t know.

198
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,818
All it takes
is one troubled loner.

199
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,404
Please let me keep them
for just a little longer.

200
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,823
(buzzing)

201
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,200
(sighs) Okay.

202
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,535
One night.

203
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,415
So, let’s see
how my burly-bottomed

204
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,708
ball handlers
are faring.

205
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:03,876
(chortles excitedly)

206
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,169
Smithers, we’re leading
two to nothing.

207
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,712
Run out
the clock, boys.

208
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,797
Run out the clock.

209
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,511
(buzzer droning)

210
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,054
Oh, yeah, three points!

211
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,139
Big three in the Big D
for the Big C.

212
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,100
Mark Cuban-- that’s me.

213
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,102
Who is that man,

214
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,020
and why isn’t his enthusiasm
being punished?

215
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,730
That’s Mark Cuban, sir.

216
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,399
He’s the most flamboyant
owner in the league.

217
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,779
I’m out of my mind!

218
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,738
(cheering)

219
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,115
How odd.

220
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,284
His money seems to have
bought him happiness.

221
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,286
(playing an upbeat tune)

222
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,582
I’d like to meet him,
Smithers.

223
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,625
So, you made your money
in nuclear power?

224
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,752
I can’t remember how
I made my money.

225
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,546
If you’re really
a billionaire,

226
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,756
give me the secret
billionaires’ handshake.

227
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,882
Smithers, turn away.

228
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,384
(groans)

229
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,357
Yay!

230
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,487
So, tell me,
why don’t you recoil

231
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,323
from the public
like a normal billionaire?

232
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,782
Hey, why own a basketball team

233
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,576
if you’re not gonna
have any fun?

234
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,910
Fun?

235
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,120
Is that how it’s pronounced?

236
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,288
I’ve only seen it written.

237
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,956
Hold that thought.

238
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,959
No one’s paid attention to me
for ten whole seconds.

239
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,210
(chainsaw roaring)

240
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,671
(crowd cheering)

241
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,132
It’s time for this peacock
to show his feathers.

242
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,717
You know, the feathers
with the big eye

243
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,594
that trick them into thinking
that’s my front?

244
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,888
Said feathers
are what I’ll flaunt.

245
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,433
BART:
Uh, Mom,

246
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,144
maybe you shouldn’t have put
so much syrup on the pancakes.

247
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,270
(Homer chewing,
moaning in delight)

248
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,856
The secret is not
to swallow the stingers.

249
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,441
(spitting)

250
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,568
Dad, don’t eat the bees!

251
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,070
They’re just drones, Lisa.

252
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,238
They only live for,
like, five minutes anyway.

253
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,948
And they only have
haploid cells,

254
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,533
not diploid
like me and Bart.

255
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,743
Yeah!

256
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,827
Listen, Lisa,

257
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:02,995
I was trying
to think

258
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,580
of a way to
help your bees,

259
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,707
and I remembered
this abandoned greenhouse

260
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,834
outside of town.

261
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,544
Which used to be a beautiful,
thriving greenhouse

262
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,879
till I was hired to run it.

263
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,839
(chuckles)

264
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,009
Your bees will have plenty
of room in this old greenhouse.

265
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,761
Plus, there
are flowers,

266
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,471
and it’s near
a prison,

267
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,931
so they’ll have a place
to sting people.

268
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,140
Oh, Mom,

269
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,100
it’s perfect!

270
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,434
Go live your lives.

271
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,852
Get off my face!

272
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,771
(buzzing)

273
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,981
Oh, I miss them.

274
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,567
Now you know how I’ll feel
when you go to college.

275
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,903
You’ll always
have Bart. Always.

276
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,781
But he’ll be gone a lot
repairing refrigerators.

277
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,450
Always.

278
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,536

this business around!

00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,734

outside the boxeola.

we are not offering childcare

let’s get ready to referendum!

There’s only one place in town
where the bees can survive,

355
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,674
and Mr. Burns wants
to tear it down.

Please, people.

358

You didn’t listen
to me about the snail darter,

359
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,972
you didn’t listen to me
about the osprey,

360
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,974

about the javelina.

of the desert?

362
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,352
Apparently not feisty enough.

00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,646
Future generations
will judge us

364
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,482
by how we cared for
the tiniest creatures.

365
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,110
I am not just asking you
to save the bees.

366
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,363
I am asking you
to save your souls.

367
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,949
(applause, cheering
and whistling)

368
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,200
Excellent speech.

369
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,619
Just excellent.

370
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,953
I no longer wish

371
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,872
to build my magnificent
new basketball stadium.

372
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,290
You don’t?

373
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,958
Heavens no!

374
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,585
No skyboxes.

375
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,128
No kiss cam.

376
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,297
Nor will we have the chance
to marvel

377
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,967
at number one draft pick
Muk Mu, the human North Pole.

378
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,928
(all gasping)

379
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,304
No, I’m afraid

380
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,514
he’ll be on the first
kayak back to Ketchikan.

381
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,350
ALL:
No!

382
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,143
Please, don’t take our freak!

383
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,770
I love you, Muk Mu!

384
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,105
CROWD (chanting):
Muk Mu! Muk Mu!

385
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,732
All those in favor

386
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,234
of building this decadent
monument to excess, say aye!

387
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,694
CROWD:
Aye!

388
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,987
(sighs)

389
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,114
Nay.

390
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,116
I know it’s not
your fault, Muk Mu.

391
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,285
You’re a gentle,
loving soul.

392
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,623
♪ ♪

393
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,883
What’s wrong with
your bees, Lisa?

394
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,885
Mr. Burns took away
their sanctuary,

395
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,345
and now,
they aren’t strong enough

396
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,138
to survive on their own.

397
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,517
I’m going home.

398
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,686
Give me the keys
to my bike lock.

399
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,688
-Are you sure?
-Give me the keys!

400
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,607
Okay, okay! Don’t know why
I had ’em in the first place.

401
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,567
(Lisa muttering
under her breath)

402
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,322
Oh, I’d do anything
to cheer up my little girl.

403
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,824
Really?

404
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,993
Listen, Homer,
in the back room,

405
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,745
I got these super-tough
Africanized bees.

406
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,206
I saw this ad
in a gentleman’s magazine

407
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,792
for excited African honeys,
and that’s what they sent me.

408
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,003
If we could combine them
with Lisa’s bees,

409
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,672
it would make them strong enough
to survive any environment.

410
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,924
But how are we supposed
to combine the DNA

411
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,343
of two strains
of the same species?

412
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,970
Actually, Homer...

413
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,805
(whispering)

414
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,223
(gasps)

415
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,267
You and me?

416
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,601
No, the bees!

417
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,853
Oh, yeah, yeah.

418
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,229
That’s what I meant, too.

419
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,441
I have no...
inclination...

420
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,775
(buzzing)

421
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,444
-Got the queen?
-Yup.

422
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,029
And she’s ready
for a night

423
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,031
of anonymous sex
with multiple partners.

424
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,240
(chuckles)

425
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,204
Now, let’s give them
some privacy while they...

426
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,582
get down to buzziness.

427
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,918
<i>♪ Come with me ♪</i>

428
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,254

(sniffles
and sighs)

432
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,887
If they was me,
they’d be done by now.

433
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,060
(exhales loudly)

434
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,145
Wow. This must be
important, Dad!

435
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,023
I’ve never seen you walk up
an incline before.

436
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,734
Sweetie, I have a very
special surprise for you.

437
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,360
-(buzzing)
-My bees?!

438
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,653
(laughs)

439
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,281
Your bees died days ago.

440
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,992
These are their angry,
mutant descendants.

441
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,953
And they’re tough enough
to live in any environment.

442
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,330
They sound awfully mad.

443
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,831
Are they dangerous?

444
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,458
Hmm, I’m not sure.
Let me check.

445
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,752
Are you guys
dangerous? Ooh!

446
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,588
A simple yes
would have sufficed.

447
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,090
(yelling)

448
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,549
Don’t worry, Lisa.

449
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,301
Where else are they gonna go?

450
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,181
To that new stadium that
looks exactly like a hive.

451
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,682
(loud buzzing)

452
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,562
Welcome to the American dream--

453
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,731
a billionaire using public funds

454
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,483
to construct
a private playground

455
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,193
for the rich and powerful.

456
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,029
(cheering and whistling)

457
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,324
And now, so our skybox owners
can really enjoy the game,

458
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,785
I shall let in the sky!

459
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,954
(loud buzzing)

460
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,622
(whimpering and groaning)

461
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,791
Stop! I am one of you!

462
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,296
(loud chatter and clamoring)

463
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,049
We’ve been invaded
by a swarm of killer bees!

464
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,926
My microphone is no microphone
at all.

465
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,136
It’s bees!

466
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,846
Am I being badly stung?

467
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,430
Yes! And it hurts!

468
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,141
(yelling)

469
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,519
(loud buzzing)

470
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:09,857
(upbeat
instrumental music plays)

471
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,775
(yelling and groaning)

472
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,408
Our bullets are useless.

473
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,659
(gunshot)
Aah!

474
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,369
Okay, they’re useful on me.

475
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,579
(crickets chirping)

476
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,460
Oh, they’ve found a home.

477
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,963
You’ve won this round,

478
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,715
but when next we meet,

479
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,551
the beekeeper
will be the beekeepee!

480
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,219
(buzzing)

481
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,556
(chuckles diabolically)

482
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,765
(screaming)

483
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,017
Help me, Muk Mu!

484
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,934
(sighs)

485
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,608
So, that’s how I was outfoxed

486
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,693
by a little girl
and her half-wit companion

487
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,446
when my beautiful stadium
was declared a bee sanctuary,

488
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,323
and I had to take
a third-quarter write down

489
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,866
of $804 million.

490
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,326
Wait a minute.

491
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,869
Someone crunch
the numbers!

492
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:10,125
He’s only worth $996,036,000

493
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,294
-(all gasping)
-He’s not a billionaire
at all!

494
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,755
Wait, wait, wait. It’s only
a matter of four million.

495
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,715
I’m sure
I can find that somewhere.

496
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,427
I, uh... I have $50 here
in my wallet.

497
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,931
Mark, can you get me off
the hook for old times’ sake?

498
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,099
Can’t do it, Monty.

499
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,851
(gasps)

500
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,436
Aw, don’t worry.

501
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,189
You’ll feel a lot
more comfortable in the...

502
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,066
millionaires’ camp.

503
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,275
No! No!

504
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,777
Just kill me now!

505
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,657
(hillbilly accent):
Howdy do?

506
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,700
I own a minor
league hockey team.

507
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,911
