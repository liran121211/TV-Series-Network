D’oh!

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,638
(screams)

4
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,725
-Huh?
-Huh?

5
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,820
Lemonade!

6
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,031
Sweet sunshine in your mouth!

7
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,699
Buy a cup,
or I punch my sister!

8
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,201
It’s true!
He’s not bluffing!

9
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,412
Hmm.

10
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,913
Ow.

11
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,665
Maybe we should
put a dollar in the jar,

12
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:41,916
prime the pump.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,043
What are we,
a piano bar?

14
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,504
(tires screeching,
people clamoring)

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,799
I’ll take 15 lemonades.

16
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,468
Make that 16.

17
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,510
Huh?!

18
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,095
Lousy dog.

19
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,431
If you had your way,
I’d walk you every day.

20
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,640
(gasps)

21
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,641
Lemonade!

22
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,060
(whimpers)

23
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,227

-(people groaning)
-Stop pushing!

25
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,105
Six cups, please.

26
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,690
And put it on my tab.

27
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,566
Keep moving,
deadbeat.

28
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,567
Cash only.

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,777
Fine.

30
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,611
Lemonade’s for babies anyways.

31
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,571
I’m going to Moe’s, for beer!

32
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,074
Have fun drinking
your lemonade, babies!

33
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,121
(car engine sputtering)

34
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,499
Lisa, can Daddy
borrow your bike?

35
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,833
I guess.

36
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,585
(grunting)

37
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,675
(screams):
Oh...!

38
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,427
(moaning)

39
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,970
(bell dings)

40
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,890
(grunting)

41
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,642

00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,728
(sighs)

44
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,106
Hey, Moe, give me a...

45
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,607
Homer, shush!

46
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,818
We’re watching Krabappel try
to break up with Skinner.

47
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,112
Seymour, I have
something difficult

48
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,113
I want to
say to you.

49
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,948
I understand.

50
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,618
It can be very difficult for
a woman to propose marriage.

51
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,537
But I am willing
to go halvsies on a ring.

52
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,621
Seymour...

53
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:02,622
(groans)

54
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,623
Excuse me.

55
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,875
Any of you lugs

56
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,544
want to break up
with my boyfriend for me?

57
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,670
I’ll buy
you a beer.

58
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,588
Seymour, Edna asked
me to talk to you.

59
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,965
Splendid!

60
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,134
Shall we discuss music
or the weather?

61
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,010
No, this is
about you.

62
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,554
Edna wants
to break up.

63
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,430
She wants to break up?

64
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,932
-Yeah.
-With me?

65
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:21,850
Yeah.

66
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,479
Look at it this way:
you’re a free man.

67
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,522
Unlike me.

68
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,232
You have all
your hair.

69
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,316
Unlike me.

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,943
No kids tying you down

71
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:35,155
or a crippling mortgage
that you refinanced at 26%

72
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,324
because a dancing
Internet cowboy told you to.

73
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,077
(sobbing):
Oh, God, I hate my life.

74
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,996
(sobbing)

75
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,666
Gee, compared to you,
my life is one big half-day.

76
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,001
Exactly.

77
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,670
You’re good looking,
you have a decent job.

78
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:54,090
What lonely widow wouldn’t
consider you an option?

79
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,133
Thanks, Homer.

80
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,885
I don’t think
the school pep squad

81
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,011
could’ve cheered me up more,

82
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,221
and they were
state runners up in 1997.

83
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,514
(whistling happy tune)

84
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,017
Homer, that was amazing.

85
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,602
He actually felt better
coming out of

86
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,978
the breakup
than he did going in.

87
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,688
Say, Homer,
you’re real good at this.

88
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,190
Think you could dump my
girlfriend Doreen for me?

89
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,524
Doreen.

90
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,775
She’s cheated on
you with everyone.

91
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,860
Well, except for me.

92
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,737
And I’ve showered her
with gifts--

93
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,324
fancy soaps and massage oils
and, uh, what have you.

94
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,575
Ooh, here she comes.

95
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,743
Work your magic, Homer.

96
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,412
Is Lenny here?

97
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,080
Oh, I’m afraid
Lenny’s dead.

98
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,248
What?

99
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,042
I just talked to him.

100
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,628
And you will again, because
he isn’t really dead.

101
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,006
And now this next piece
of news won’t seem so bad.

102
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,049
(children clamoring)
Lemonade!

103
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,091
We want lemonade!

104
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,343
Don’t worry, folks.

105
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,094
Our master chef is
stirring up a fresh batch.

106
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,518
Stop that transaction!

107
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,062
I’m a part-time field agent

108
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,355
with the Springfield
Department of Commerce.

109
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,356
Great gig.

110
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,524
It <i>is </i>a great gig.

111
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,567
May I see your
vendor’s license?

112
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,985
Um, I think it’s...

113
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,028
We don’t have one.

114
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,529
(coins clinking)

115
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,281
35 cents?

116
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,699
Where did that come from?

117
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,992
Can’t be mine.

118
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,369
Must be yours.

119
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,454
I don’t care
if it’s 45 cents,

120
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,872
I don’t want it.

121
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,249
Submit this form to
the License Bureau.

122
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,541
Until then, this
stand is closed.

123
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,293
til then, this
stand is closed. Boys.

124
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,715
Geez, I’m thirsty.

125
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,758
You got any lemonade?

126
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,510
Not anymore!

127
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,511
(muttering):
...lemonade.

128
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,512
(grunts)

129
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,976
-(people grumbling)
-Come on already.

130
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,477
Come on, come on.

131
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,937
I was halfway through
an operation

132
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,146
when my license expired.

133
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,606
I’ll get to you,

134
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,608
just as soon as I finish
this crossword puzzle.

135
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,026
-(grumbling, groaning)
-Ah, no, come on.

136
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,152
Let’s go, buddy.

137
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,238
I left bananas in my car.

138
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,532
Let’s see, uh, ten across:

139
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,659
"Franklin Roosevelt’s
middle name."

140
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,952
Excitement.

141
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,078
Oh, wait, that don’t fit.

142
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,247
(grumbling, groaning)

143
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,581
Maybe you could use some help.

144
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,087
"FDR’s middle name": "Delano."

145
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,089
"Oxidized surface":
Well, that’s "rusty."

146
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,465
"Bartenders serve them ’dirty.’"

147
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,466
Ham sandwiches!

148
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,801
No, "martinis."

149
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,094
Oh, right.
(chuckles)

150
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,096
One more word!
"Singer of Yentl," 13 letters.

151
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,014
Um...

152
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,851
I got it!

153
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,853
"Isaac Bashevis!"

154
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,396
Now, give me my license!

155
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,939
Give everyone their license!

156
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,025
(cheering)

157
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,943
Whoo, what is
a four-letter word for "hero"?

158
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,153
"Hero."

159
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,821
Yes,
but I meant "Lisa."

160
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,449
ALL (chanting):
Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!

161
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,326
(phone rings)

162
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,869
-Y’ello.
-Homer?

163
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,245
It’s your old roommate, Grady.

164
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,288
The gay guy?

165
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,748
That’s not all I am!

166
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,624
Well, it’s a lot of what I am.

167
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,711
Any-hoo, I heard how good
you are at breaking up couples.

168
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,713
I need your help
to break up with Julio,

169
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,340
’cause I met
someone new,

170
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,509
someone much more
cool and refreshing.

171
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,720
Uh-huh, got it.

172
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:46,804
(calling out):
Marge,

173
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,806
I’m going to
a hardcore gay club,

174
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,725
and I won’t be home
till 3:00 in the morning!

175
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,602
MARGE:
Have fun!

176
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,814
(giggles)

177
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,316
<i>Ay carumba!</i>

178
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,319
Bart, I’ve fallen in love
with crosswords.

179
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,403
(laughs hysterically)

180
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,654
It finally happened.

181
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,614
You’ve gone completely
fruit loops.

182
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,491
"Fruit Loops."

183
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,243
That’s the answer to 38 down:
"Toucan’s delight."

184
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,870
No, I mean

Oh, thanks

"Bart":
"San Francisco people mover."

192
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,345
Speaking of San Francisco
people mover...

193
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,930
(loud dance music playing)

194
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,685
(Spanish accent):
Grady is breaking
up with me?!

195
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,980
You’ll always have
a special place in his heart!

196
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,023
In his what?

197
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,903
Aw.

198
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,197
Oh, baby, you are
the breakup king.

199
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,408
You-You have made
the seven minutes

200
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,952
that I’m gonna go without love
so much more bearable.

201
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,455
Anyone else want me to get rid
of that special someone?

202
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,208
Okay, everyone,
rotate one to your right.

203
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,468
Guess what, Mom.
I’m a cruciverbalist.

204
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,095
Another religion?

205
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,472
(sighs)
You know, you’re just
gonna drop the whole thing

206
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,308
when you go to college
and get a Jewish boyfriend.

207
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:18,104
Probably.
But a cruciverbalist
is a fan of crossword puzzles,

208
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,355
which I am!

209
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,940
Me, too!

210
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,276
I been doing
them since 1958.

211
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,320
Back then, we called them
Alphabet Hotels,

212
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,990
’cause every letter
gets its own little room.

213

214
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,245
I still do the <i>Springfield</i>

215
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,913
Uh-huh, let’s see there.

216
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,583
Grampa, everyone knows
that the only real test of skill

217
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,042
is the <i>New York Times </i>puzzle,

two things I’m no longer
allowed to change by myself.

221
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,641
Okay, back to the real world.

Sure is.

00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,013
Marge, if I had
a hundred dollars

for every customer
I’d broken up,

271
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,974
I’d have exactly
this amount.

Homie, I’m not sure about
this new business of yours.

275
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,733
You’re making it too easy
for couples to break up

276
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,318
just because
they hit a rough patch.

277
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,320
I know this is hard on you.

278
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,780
But in time, you’ll come
to see it’s for the best.

279
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,074
That’s one of your
breakup lines!

280
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,494
What would have happened
if there was someone

281
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,248
who could break us up every
time I had my doubts about you?

282
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:39,221

283
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,181

We are the spirits

286
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,436

287
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,396

288
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,522

couples would have had.

291
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,446
And we’re the antiques

292
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,989

bought together.

00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,576

294
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,037
Get him, chairs and babies!

295
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,873

296
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,000

297
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,502
Homie?

298
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,295
Marge, I’m getting out
of the breakup business.

299
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,673
And I don’t know if I’ll ever
sleep soundly again!

300
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,674
Well, maybe...

301
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,467
(snoring)

302
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,647
Wow, so this is
what this is.

303
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,566
Cruciverbalists from far
and wide have gathered here

304
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,361
for a no-holds-barred
test of skill.

305
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,238
Surely some holds
are barred.

306
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,364
No, none.

307
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,866
Well, it sounds
really exciting,

308
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,077
and you’re a delightful
young lady.

309
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,204
Now if you’ll excuse me.

310
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,163
(humming)

311
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,750
Hey, what’s going on?

312
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,336
It’s kind of a secret, so shut
the door most of the way.

313
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,676
We found a way to make this
tournament interesting.

314
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,095
We bet on the matches.

315
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,304
Really?

316
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,515
Well, I did bring this envelope
full of money.

317
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,643
And these days, betting in a bar
is safer than any stock,

318
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,687
bond or real estate investment.

319
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,522
Agreed.
So, who are you gonna bet on?

320
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,775
I want you to put it all on
my little girl.

321
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,527
And parlay with the Asian kid.

322
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,570
He has a name,
you know.

323
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,029
What is it?

324
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,156
I don’t know.
He’s not my kid.

325
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,535
I win!

326
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,745
She won!

327
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,121
And like any
prudent gambler,

328
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,707
I know when
to walk away: never!

I’ll explain that to you

I always sabotage myself

349

when I’m on the verge
of happiness.

350
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,018
-You what?
-In my young life,

351
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,770
I’ve seen that every time

352
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,563
I’m about to achieve
true happiness,

353
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,234
some little piece of me says,
"You don’t deserve this."

354
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,444
And another little piece
says, "I agree."

355
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,695
Right, right.

356
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,822
But will it happen
this time?

357
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,324
With my luck,
I bet it will.

358
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,867
It’s practically
a sure thing.

359
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,160
Hmm...

360
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,037
(gasps)

361
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,580
Contestants to your boards.

362
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,581
Wish me luck.

363
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,916
Just be yourself.

364
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,002
I want to change my bet.

365
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,046
I’m going against my daughter.

366
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,881
-(all gasp)
-I’ll take your money,

367
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,342
but I won’t look
you in the eye.

368
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,761
Fine.
I won’t look <i>you </i>in the eye.

369
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,888
(grunting)

370
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,934
Have I made the bet yet?

371
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,227
I got it.

372
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,688
We’re down to our final two
contestants.

373
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,190
But before they compete,
we would like to pay tribute

374
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,526
to all the words that have been
removed from the dictionary

375
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,902
in the past year.

376
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,320
(soft music plays)

377
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,406
(applause)

378
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,950
(applause)

379
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,329
(applause)

380
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,165
(applause)

381
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,253
(applause)

382
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,464
You know,
my wife Shirley,

383
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,925
she’s the real
crossword ace
in our family.

384
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,261
Fills in those letters
fast as hail on a tin roof:

385
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,722
ping-ping-ping, she’s done.

386
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,349
Ah, Shirley passed away
two years ago,

387
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,767
but I’m still not over it.

388
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,644
Aw, that’s so sad.

389
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,937
Hey, what can you do?

390
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,230
Life keeps changing
the music,

391
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,274
but you gotta keep up
the cha-cha-cha, huh?

392
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,234
(humming)

393
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,569
(buzzer sounds)

394
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,867
Let’s see, I’ll spread
some Qs around.

395
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,994
That’ll get my brain going.
(gasps)

396
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,290
Oh, I dropped my glasses.

397
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,126
Oh, Shirley, baby,
I let you down.

398
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,794
(sobbing)

399
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,134
Hey, there are no lenses
in these glasses.

400
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,552
Let’s see,
that’s "Enrico Fermi",

401
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,970
and there you’ve got
the "Pet Shop Boys,"

402
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,681
and cross the T and zing the Z
and skit-skat skoodily

403
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,515
I’m all the way home.

404
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,516
(buzzer sounds)

405
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,602
(all cheering)

406
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,437
Lisa got hustled.

407
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,483
Oh, I blew it again.

408
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,568
She blew it again.
Whoo-hoo!

409
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,903
Here’s your money...

410
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,821
drenched in your
daughter’s tears.

411
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,156
You know,
for a bartender-bookie,

412
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,908
you’re awfully judgmental.

413
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,206
(whistling happy tune)

414
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,875
Boy, Dad seems
awfully happy.

415
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,169
And there’s something
different about him.

416
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,675
He bought new shoelaces
with fancy metal tips.

417
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,305
Dad, did you come
into some money

418
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,306
we don’t know about?

419
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,307
(gasps)

420
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,642
No.

421
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,935
You got highlights
in your hair!

422
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,230
Uh... the sun did that.

423
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,316
And your car antenna
has been straightened
and re-balled.

424
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,652
What’s going on?

425
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,448
Well, sweetie, Daddy made
a little extra money

426
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,784
betting against you
in the crossword tournament.

427
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,452
You’ll understand
when you’re a parent

428
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,830
placing large wagers
against your own children.

429
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,665
I hope you’re not mad.

430
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,003
No, I’m not mad.

431
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,385
You sure you’re not mad?

432
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,388
No. I’m not mad.

433
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,392
You sure you’re not mad?

434
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,228
No, I’m not mad.

435
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:05,315
Mr. Teddy,
can you ask Lisa if she’s mad?

436
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,650
What’s that, Mr. Teddy?

437
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,360
You’re saying
that you know women,

438
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,571
and that when women say
they’re not mad,

439
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,448
they’re madder than ever?

440
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,700
Oh... she’s gone.

441
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,244
Can you drive me home?
I’m a little drunk.

442
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,122
Lisa?

443
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,708
Lisa?!

444
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,461
Lisa, sweetie,
please look at your Daddy.

445
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,629
You stopped
being my Daddy

446
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,673
as soon as you
bet against me!

447
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,800
All I have now is a mom,

448
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,927
which is why I’m taking her
maiden name!

449
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,181
From now on, I’m Lisa Bouvier!

450
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,975
(gasping)

451
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,560
Hey, Mr. S.

452
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,437
Lisa B.

453
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,565
(screams):
No...!

454
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,609
Would you like to buy
some band candy?

455
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:52,071
Yes...!

456
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,739
Lisa’s mad at me,

457
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:57,493
and now she’s using Marge’s
maiden name instead of mine.

458
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,328
Homer, whatever you done
to that little girl,

459
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,914
you just gotta do something
even nicer to win her back.

460
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,207
She may never take
back your name,

461
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,333
but there’s
still a chance

462
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,918
she’ll take you
back as a Daddy.

463
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,462
Wow, nobody gives better
parenting advice

464
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,715
than childless drunks.

465
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,218
So the name "Lisa Simpson"
is available, huh?

466
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,220
Lotta goodwill attached
to that name.

467
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,179
I gonna take it.

468
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,597
(phone rings)

469
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,182
Lisa’s Tavern, Lisa speaking.

470
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,608
Lisa, sweetie,
I’m honored

471
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,402
that you chose my name,
but it’s not that great.

472
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,570
Back in high school,

473
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,115
the boys used to call me
Marge "Boobier."

474
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,659
Hey, Bouvier was Jackie
Kennedy’s maiden name.

475
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,494
Really?
I never knew that.

476
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,121
What did you think
her name was

477
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,664
before it was Kennedy?

478
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,833
Jackie "O."
Like SpaghettiOs.

479
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,710
I thought that was where
her money came from.

480
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,129
Look, why don’t
you cheer up

481
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,090
by doing a <i>New York Times</i>
crossword puzzle, huh?

482
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,883
I’m through
with crosswords.

483
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,137
My innocence died
in those 441 little boxes.

484
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,056
It might be a fun way
to kill a couple hours.

485
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,891
A couple hours?

486
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,394
I can do the Sunday puzzle
in less than one hour.

487
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,728
(chuckles)

488
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,772
(scoffs):
A couple of hours.

489
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:12,526
Last clue: "Loses on purpose."

490
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,111
Huh...

491
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,779
(gasps):
Diets!

492
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,905
(chuckles)

493
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,491
Oh, Will Shortz,
you clever rascal.

494
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,077
And a new record time.

495
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,495
Wait a second.

496
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,623
"Dumb Dad Sorry For His Bet."

497
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,793
Wow, it’s almost as if
Dad planted that message.

498
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:33,505
No, it must just be
a weird coincidence.

499
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,257
But what if it’s not?

500
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,550
Oh, it must be.

501
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,634
Or mustn’t it not?

502
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,939
Dad, I know
this is crazy,

503
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,983
but did you plant
a message to me

504
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,318
in the <i>New York Times</i>
crossword puzzle?

505
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,613
Well, I had a little help
from this guy.

506
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:01,033
(gasps):
<i>New York Times </i>Crossword
Editor Will Shortz!

507
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,536
(gasps):
And master puzzle
constructor Merl Reagle!

508
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,455
I actually wrote that crossword.

509
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,415
And I edited it.

510
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,333
Now get back
to crosswording!

511
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,585
Yes, sir.

512
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,546
Well, I must admit,
I’m kind of touched.

513
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,465
"Dumb Dad Sorry
For His Bet."

514
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,217
Nice.

515
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,219
You didn’t get Homer’s
whole message, Lisa.

516
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,511
I didn’t?

517
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,181
Take a look at the first letters
of all the clues.

518
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:32,314
<i>HOMER:</i>
<i>Dear Lisa,</i>
<i>you make me so happy.</i>

519
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,442
<i>Really, really, really happy.</i>

520
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,570
<i>Sorry, he told me I needed</i>
<i>a 144 letters.</i>

00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,324
<i>Oh, right.</i>

523
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:46,828
<i>Bouvier or Simpson,</i>
<i>I cherish you.</i>

524
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,206
Oh, Dad.
