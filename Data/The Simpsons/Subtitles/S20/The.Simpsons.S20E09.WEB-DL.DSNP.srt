You’re older. Why don’t you do
these fun activities?

Uh, ’cause no
one’s making me.

Namaste.

29
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,076
Pardon me, Master,

30
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,079
but what does a big fat wad
like you know about kung fu?

31
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,998
Ah. Kung fu
is not about physique,

32
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,043
but the channeling of
one’s energy or chi.

33
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,129
If you doubt my skill,

34
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,632

Oh!

38
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,097
My chi!

00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,474
(classical music plays)

40
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,150
Do we have any more paints?

41
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,819
My orange isn’t the orange
of that orange.

42
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,612
Just paint the damn fruit.

43
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,614
Lower your expectations, Lisa.

44
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,658
Public program, public program.

45
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,161
Mm-hmm.

Mm... hmm.

47
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,914
Stop! Stop!

48
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,624
Juliet, this
is terrible!

49
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,210
Your art is
personal and wrong.

50
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,503
(with British accent):
I was painting with my heart,

51
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,547
and if you look carefully,

52
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,924
you can see
that the knight is Josh Groban,

53
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,759
our young century’s
greatest vocalist.

54
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,803
Oh, another Grobanite!

55
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,056
Um, excuse me,

56
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,059
but I think her painting
is very imaginative.

57
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,769
I suppose you’d like
to teach this class?

58
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,646
Yes, I would.

59
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,941
Class, everyone please stop
and admire Juliet’s painting.

60
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,903
I do not need this!

61
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,821
My family owns a gas station.

62
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,032
If you two thoughtful
and creative girls

63
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,075
don’t like the way I teach,

64
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,703
there’s a world of fun outside.

65
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,456

78
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,898

I need some candy for

92
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,944
but I don’t want
to come on too strong.

93
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,153
-M&M’S?
-Well, if I pick plain,

94
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,613
she’ll think I’m cheap,

95
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,573

she may have an allergy.

her, Bart!

What is this,
Brooklyn in the ’50s?

99
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,996
Don’t just say stuff.

100
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,581
You ask for my help,
then you don’t want it.

101
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,042
Excuse me, but why not
consider an Almond Joy?

102
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,004
It looks like you only brought
something for yourself,

103
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,589
but then you just happen
to have two pieces.

104
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,925
Finally, a real
suggestion!

105
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,469
If she doesn’t like coconut,
you’re screwed!

106
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,971
Mm...

107
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,475
Oh.

108
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,602

109
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,354
(laughter and chatter)

110
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,648
Hi, Juliet.

111
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,400
So, what do you want to do?

112
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,403
I don’t know. It’s been so long
since I’ve had a playdate.

113
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,697
Not that I couldn’t get
one if I wanted. I...

114
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,490
My parents bought me
a membership card

115
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,034
to the Folk Art Museum.

116
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,827
Does it get you into
special exhibits?

117
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,078
On Wednesdays.

118
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,456
(gasps)
That’s today!

119
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,792

120
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,253
("Wipe Out" playing)

121
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,905
So Lisa asked if her new friend
could stay for dinner.

122
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:07,450
She’s finally doing something
the book said she would.

123
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,869
Won’t last.

124
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,954
(both giggling)

125
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,875
Hey, Mom,
can Juliet sleep over?

126
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,627
Are your parents
okay with that?

127
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,836
They never met us.

128
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,421
We could be
murderers.

129
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,800
Could’ve been
if we hadn’t had kids.

130
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,093
Juliet’s father
is the world’s

131
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,136
foremost John Grisham scholar.

132
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,181
He found several
undiscovered plot
twists in <i>The Client.</i>

133
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,766
And he proved
that the real villain

134
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,976
in <i>A Time to Kill</i>
is the legal system itself.

135
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,353
Told you, Marge.

136
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,437
Told... ja.

137
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,482

00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,986
I-I mean, queendom.

141
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,448
How about... Equalia?

142
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,117
Equalia.

143
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,744
Where everyone is equal,

144
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,371
but we’re in charge.

145
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,040
I mean, somebody
has to be, right?

146
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,084
Okay, you two,
lights out.

147
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,297
Lisa, do you want
to be best friends?

148
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,466
Gosh, this is all
happening so fast.

149
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,260
I don’t know
what to say.

150
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,803
(quietly):
Say yes! Say yes!

151
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,929
I’d love to!

152
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,557
MARGE:
Woo-hoo!

153
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,016
Good night, Lisa.

154
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,271
I have a best friend.

155
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,647
You heard me say that,
didn’t you?

156
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,107
I did.

157
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,066
We’re still cool,
though, right?

158
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,234
We are.

159
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,237
My best friend
is so cool.

160
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,202
Mom, I’m meeting
Juliet after school.

161
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,038
Great. Here are a few
best friend tips.

162
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,582
Compliment her hair
and shoes.

163
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:41,169
If her dog bites you, don’t make
a big deal out of it and...

164
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,837
Friendship is
like marriage.

165
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,422
The key is
listening.

166
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,800
Also, if her dog bites you,
don’t make a big deal out of it.

167
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:48,676
I just said that.

168
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,553
Okay, honey.

169
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,638
If it’s that important
to you, <i>you </i>said it.

170
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,098
(groans)

171
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,975
We’re at the end
of chapter four.

172
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,852
But we need a grabber,
a whammy,

173
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,520
a snap-a-roo,
some eye mustard.

174
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,521
I got it!

175
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,356
How about this?

176
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,443
What if Queen Helvetica found
a rare two-horned unicorn?

177
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,986
A two-nicorn!

178
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,946
Oh. I love your accent.

179
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,698
(with British accent):
Two-nicorn.

180
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,117
(normal voice):
You are definitely
doing the book on tape.

181
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,874
And Queens Valedictoria
and Helvetica

182
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:23,377
hid their beloved two-nicorn
from the hungry ogre Homeroni.

183
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,545
(Lisa laughs)

184
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,340
(both giggling)

185
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,258
Girls are so lame.

186
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,010
Isn’t that right,
headless Darth Vader?

187
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,303
What’s that?

188
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,721
You miss your girlfriend,

189
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,182
armless Malibu Stacey
wrapped in hockey tape? Mm.

190
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,558
(kissing sounds)

191
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,940
Now remember,
Juliet’s family is very classy,

192
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,192
so be on
your best behavior.

193
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,194
Use as many big
words as possible.

194
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,529
I call computer.

195
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,738
Bart, you can
have doorbell.

196
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:51,739
Oh.

197
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,658

198
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,661
Nice doorbell.

199
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,037
Is it computerized?

200
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,664
-Hey, that was...
-Oh!

201
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,831
Homer!

202
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,708
Uh, we... I...

203
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,252
You come up
with an excuse!

204
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,212
-(grunts)
-Ow!

205
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,672
(British accent):
Homer, isn’t it wonderful

206
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,299
that my Juliet and your Lisa
have become such fast friends?

207
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,468
(chuckles)
If you say so, my lord.

208
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,719
Dinner’s ready.

209
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,513
If you’ll show me
to your bathroom,

210
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,640
I’d like to pretend
to wash my hands.

211
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,933
Ah, new friendship.

212
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,810
So full of promise.

213
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,564
Much like a young Mitch McDeere
in John Grisham’s <i>The Firm.</i>

214
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,774
When they make a movie
from his books,

215
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,943
does he get one
or two free tickets?

216
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,279
It depends
on the production company.

217
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,073
"He had much to be happy about.

218
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,450
A brilliant mind
and a solid body

219
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,328
that did not gain weight
and needed little sleep."

220
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,497
Attention, everyone.

221
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,873
Lisa and I would like

222
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,709
to perform a medley
of Josh Groban’s

223
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,669
12 most popular downloads.

224
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,462
Juliet, I’m worried

225
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,716
this Josh Groban is becoming
a bit of an obsession for you.

226
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,843
Let’s just listen
to James Horner’s soundtrack

227
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,386
to <i>The Pelican Brief,</i>
shall we?

228
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,179
(orchestral
soundtrack music playing)

229
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,640
Ah, track three--
"Researching the Brief."

230

(orchestral soundtrack

231
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,439

234
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:16,198
I’ll go get her.

235
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,118
Hey, can you take a look
at a lump on my back?

236
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,037
I’m not that
kind of doctor.

237
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,538
Oh, I get it.

238
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,540
Here’s ten bucks.

239
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,167
Hmm.

240
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,463
That’s chewing gum.

241
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,881
What a racket.

243
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,176
Juliet, are you okay?

244
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,594
I am now.

245
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,220
Don’t <i>you </i>see them?

246
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,724
See who?

247
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,142
Our friends!

248
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,519

of Equalia!

249

Ah, yes, the one I’ve seen

287
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,846
I search all the children’s
Facebook pages

288

289
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,768

00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,053
I know where they are.

363
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,554
Wait.

364
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,931
Hmm?

365
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,307
Is it some place
I’d have to put on a tie?

366
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,850
No.

367
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,143
Is it a place
I’d look overdressed

368
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,228
if I did wear a tie?

369
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,729
You probably would.

370
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,856
What about a jacket and jeans
with a nice T-shirt?

371
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,274
Just go.

372
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,150
(whimpers)

373
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,661
You know what I think
killed this place?

374
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,912
No one wanted
to drive

375
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,372
to the middle of the
forest for clams.

376
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,331
(vehicle approaching,
tires screeching)

377
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,460
Let’s go get my
little girl.

378
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,048
(gasps)
My family’s here.

379
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,051
Hmm?

380
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,928
She’s not here?

381
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,640
Hmm?

382
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,641
(both gasp)

383
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,476
Girls in our hideout?

384
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,894
Now they’ll tell people

385
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,272
where we go to stash
our stolen peaches.

386
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,566
And to wait out
our bad haircuts.

387
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,775
We’d better tie ’em up.

388
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,197
This place is where we came
after my bar mitzvah.

389
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,199
You said you weren’t
having one.

390
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,451
Uh...
it was just family.

391
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,790
(locks click)

392
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,584
All these pictures
of seafood

393
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,002
are making me hungry.

394
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,336
We’ll get some cream
for the peaches

395
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,671
while you guard
the prisoners.

396
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,049
Don’t screw it up, butt-brain.

397
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,718
At least my dad didn’t
smoke after his stroke.

398
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,344
(door closes)

399
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,180
(quietly):
Juliet, I’m scared.

400
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,891
Shut your eyes and
you’ll be in Equalia.

401
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,226
Equalia is not real.

402
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,103
Maybe not, but it’s
better than this.

403
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:45,981
Yeah.

404
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,610
So the armies of the gnomes
and the elves

405
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:53,697
faced off on either side of the
hollow, broad axes poised.

406
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,324
With a fearsome cry,

407
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,201
they raced towards the center
of the battlefield,

408
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,411
banners aflutter in the breeze.

409
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,205
What comes next?

410
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,794
A battle to determine
the fate of Equalia.

411
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,295
But you wouldn’t
be interested.

412
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,089
I have a wide variety
of interests.

413
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,632
Is there them dragon things?

414
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,510
Isn’t that
a little clichéd?

415
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,969
Yes. I mean, yes.

416
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,971
There are dragons
everywhere.

417
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,973
Green ones,
Chinese ones,

418
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,975
chubby bald ones.

419
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,393
I like those ones.

420
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,145
Tell me about those.

421
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,732
And so the queens...

422
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,192
And the Me-Dragon.

423
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,611
...danced the minuet
of equality

424
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,196
on a gossamer dewdrop.

425
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,364
Aw.

426
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,575
Wha...?

427
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,160
What’s going on here?

428
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,495
What’s this?

429
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,788
An ambitious
first novel

430
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,414
by the two brightest
young writers

431
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,667
this side of the Iowa
Writers Workshop.

432
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,128
I bet it’ll
burn up good.

433
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,673
(evil laughter)

434
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,594
(evil laughter)

435
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,722
Put the book down.

436
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,183
Why should we,
butt-brain?

437
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,270
For Equalia!

438
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,648

Well, it looks

443
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,540
Looks like.

444
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:30,085
Juliet, I don’t want to go
to Equalia anymore.

445
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,461
What do you mean?

446
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,921
It’s a special place,

447
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,923
but I need to live
in the real world.

448
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,967
The real world?

449
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,969
The real world
is for people

450
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,721
who can’t imagine
anything better.

451
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,723
Good-bye, Lisa.

452
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,185
Good-bye, Juliet.

453
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,188
(singsongy):
Cuckoo.

454
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,025
"We have received
your manuscript

455
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,860
The Chronicles of Equalia."

456
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,778
Sounds promising
so far.

457
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,405
"Unfortunately,

458
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,200
it is not what we’re looking
for at this time.

459
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,993
Thank you for thinking of us."

460
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,412
(laughs)
Re-jected.

461
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,874
You got a letter all the way
from New York City,

462
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,918
and that’s something.

463
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,753
And you know
what else, sweetie?

464
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,297
You and your friend,
Princess Nutjob,

465
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,883
inspired me to write
my own fantasy novel,

466
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,303
based on my experiences
as a dad.

467
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,184
Okay, chapter one,

468
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:30,771
uh...

469
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,272
(moaning):
Oh.

470
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,857
Writing is hard.

471
