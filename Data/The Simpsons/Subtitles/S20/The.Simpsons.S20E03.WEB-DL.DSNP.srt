00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,644
No more non-dice board games.

185
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,937
What?

186
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,022
You can’t take my Balderdash!

187
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,315
I just did.

188
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,566
(grunts)

189
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,526
I don’t mean to be bad.

190
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,279
I don’t know why I do
the things I do.

191
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,949
Ah!

192
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,368
(jibbering)

193
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,204
No one understands me.

194
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,788
I wish I had a different family.

195
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,790
I feel exactly
the same way.

196
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,793
Oh, my God.

197
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,421
You look like a dorky
version of me!

198
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,591
And you look like
a dimwitted version of me!

199
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,552
And you two are
ten-year-old versions of me!

200
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,763
The three of us could create
quite a lot of mischief,

201
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,806
but I have to fly back
to New York.

202
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,475
That’s where my wife
and I live.

203
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,518
That’s her.

204
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,269
You want to see pictures
of our kids?

205
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,604
(shuddering)

206
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,609
My name’s Simon
Woosterfield.

207
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,818
"Woosterfield"?

208
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,445
Your family owns
this place!

209
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,863
And Woosterfield Arena!

210
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,115
Bonnie Raitt played there!
You guys must be loaded!

211
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,367
Yes.

212
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,078
No, but the funny thing
about being rich

213
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,163
is sometimes
you wake up feeling...

214
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,331
Terrific? Incredible?

215
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,499
Happy as a clown?

216
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,501
Oh, yeah,
I’m livin’ the dream.

217
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,503
(hacking cough)

218
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,380
(inhaling)

219
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,716
Wouldn’t it be hilarious
if we switched places

220
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,677
and lived each other’s
lives for a while?

221
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,262
Mmm, I don’t know.

222
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,264
I’m pretty attached
to my family, and...

223
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,682
HOMER:
Get out here, boy!

224
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,642
I want to punish you
before I get drunk

225
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,811
-and merciful!
-Deal.

226
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,062
My father’s name
is Homer.

227
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,647
My mother’s name
is Mom.

228
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,691
My sister’s name is Lisa,
but everyone calls her Loser.

229
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:27,733
(chuckles)

230
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,402
My butler’s name is Chester.

231
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,320
I have a brother named Devon
and a sister named Quenly.

232
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,197
Oh, and my horse is
called Shadowfax.

233
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,407
You can’t miss him.

234
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,700
He’s the only Lipizzaner
in our stable.

235
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,285
Lipizzaner... got it.

236
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,539
There you are,
Master Simon!

237
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,916
Thank you, uh, Lipizzaner.

238
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,876
As you say, sir.

239
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,378
-Watch your head.
-Ow!

240
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,963
Huh?

241
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,590
-Mmm.
-(Homer grunting)

242
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,302
You ruin everything!

243
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,886
Driver, laugh at those people
for me.

244
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,305
My pleasure, sir.

245
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,641
(forced laughing)

246
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,644
(classical music plays)

247
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:10,568
McMansion.

248
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,570
McDonald’s?

249
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,572
McDreamy.

250
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,198
McSteamy.

251
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,575
McMansion.

252
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,368
Fleetwood Mac,

253
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,120
and Macauley Culkin.

254
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,334
And this is your home, sir.

255
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,753
But of course
you already knew that.

256
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:33,382
Awesome!

257
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,093
Meh.

258
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,764
This is my bedroom?

259
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,016
A candy corn volcano!

260
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,060
A ceiling from Saddam’s palace!

261
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,063
Ooh, and a racecar bed.

262
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,066
That really races!

263
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,776
(whirring)

264
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,778
Wow, a cool poster
of Joe Montana!

265
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:54,862
It’s not a poster.

266
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,447
-(screams)
-I’m the real deal.

267
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,948
Every day
I stand here

268
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,534
the family donates a million
dollars to Notre Dame.

269
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,536
Did you know the words
"Notre Dame" are French,

270
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,664
but the team is
the Fighting Irish?

271
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,499
That’s the kind of thing
I think about in here.

272
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,625
Back in the poster, gabby.

273
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,668
Yes, sir.

274
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,836
(fanfare music playing)

275
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:13,964
Milhouse, it’s me.

276
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,758
Check out the caller ID
on your phone.

277
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,884
"Blocked Number"?

278
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,887
That service is $3.65 a month.

279
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,806
Did you switch places

280
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,600
with a millionaire kid
who looks just like you?

281
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,601
Just sit tight.

282
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,686
I’m sending a car.

283
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:32,108
(Simpsons chewing loudly)

284
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,111
Why are these noodles orange?

285
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,239
I made it with Cheetos,
just like you like it.

286
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,242
If the sauce is too thick,
I can add more root beer.

287
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,576
Maybe I’m just not hungry.

288
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,578
Human garbage can
to the rescue.

289
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,038
(chewing loudly)

290
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,915
(with mouth full):
Mmm... so at work today,

291
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,252
we got a memo saying
everyone’s getting new chairs.

292
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,795
Father, could you...

293
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,046
Talk louder?
You bet.

294
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,257
Naturally,
I threw my old chair

295
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,967
in the Dumpster
right away,

296
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,178
but then Lenny said,
"No, that <i>was </i>the new chair.

297
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,722
That memo was
two months old."

298
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,807
So now I’m sitting
on an orange crate.

299
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,434
I never felt so...

300
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,853
-Please stop spitting
food on me!
-Huh?

301
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:12,064
Keep your meal in your mouth,
you semiliterate spew-monkey.

302
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,482
That’s it, boy.

303
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,443
You’re going to bed
without supper.

304
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,073
That was an odd thing
for Bart to say.

305
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,410
Maybe he’s going
through... certain changes.

306
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,786
If that boy thinks
I’m paying

307
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,414
to put him through four years
of puberty, forget it.

308
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,957
(muttering):
Stupid kids think

309
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,792
I’m made of hormones.

310
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,960
Mm...

311
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,629
Mr. La-Di-Da ...

312
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,340
This is the greatest great hall

313
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,967
I’ve ever
eaten in, Bart.

314
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,220
-Huh?
-I mean Simon.

315
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,139
Oh.

316
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,060
This must be my half-brother
and half-sister.

317
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,605
They’re beautiful.

318
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,315
I mean, just the girl.

319
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,609
I didn’t notice
the beautiful boy.

320
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:00,404
So I said, "Dad, I wanted a
Range Rover, not a Land Rover.

321
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,907
This is the worst
Martin Luther King Day ever."

322
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,366
Well, well,

323
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,786
if it isn’t
our half-wit half-brother.

324
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,750
Ow!

325
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,751
The old hot spoon.

326
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,085
But why?

327
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,670
Because you’re
our half-brother,

328
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,089
you’re blocking our full
inheritance and we hate you.

329
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,592
Oh, now I get it.

330
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,344
Hmm.

331
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:26,305
Bart, I have a crush
on your new sister.

332
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,015
You had a crush
on my old sister.

333
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,643
Yeah, but that was never going
to happen.

334
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,856
-(growls)
-Give me back my newspaper.

335
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,858
MARGE:
Homer, it’s not
a real paper.

336
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,944
It’s a rubber chew toy.

337
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,529
For your information,
<i>The Daily Growl</i>

338
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,448
is the only newspaper
that’s not afraid

339
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,450
to say how great
this country is.

340
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,993
-(grunts and chuckles)
-(toy squeaks)

341
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:48,994
How’s the war going?

342
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:49,912
-(squeaks)
-We’re winning?

343
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:50,913
That’s great.

344
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,914
And our standing abroad?

345
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,333
-(squeaks)
-Fantastic.

346
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,003
(line ringing)

347
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,297
This place is insane.

348
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,049
Tonight, I got sent to bed
without dinner.

349
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,592
Oh, yeah.

350
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,386
Well, what’s up
with your brother and sister?

351
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,514
They’re jealous because
my father left their mother

352
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,099
to be with my mother, to...

353
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,141
Eh, you lost me.

354
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,476
Well, got to go.

355
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,894
Enjoy the upper-lower
middle class.

356
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,189
(groans)

357
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,984
Bart, honey, I saw
you didn’t like your dinner,

358
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,277
so I thought
you might like

359
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,737
pepperoni pizza
with the crust cut off.

360
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,199
Now, let me tuck you in,
fluff your pillow,

361
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,326
and sprinkle
a little fairy dust

362
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,287
to keep
the monsters away.

363
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,580
(whispering):
It’s cinnamon.

364
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,956
Mm...

365
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,292
Nighty-night, sweetheart.

366
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,795
I could get used to this.

367
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,424
Fancy party.

368
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,885
This is like a rap video
before the rappers show up.

369
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,638
Mmm... mmm.

370
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,600
Simon, have you ever seen
the family mausoleum?

371
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,602
All the Woosterfields
will be buried here.

372
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,270
Do you know
that after a hundred years

373
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,522
dead bodies turn
to red licorice?

374
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,108
Whoa-ho, let me at it.

375
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,613
<i>Help! Let me out.</i>

376
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,824
<i>I have my doubts</i>
<i>about this licorice!</i>

377
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,992
(groans weakly)

378
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,494
Oh, Mr. Burns,
I’m really sorry.

379
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,288
(chuckling):
Nonsense, young Woosterfield.

380
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,165
Your fortune
is greater than mine.

381
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,250
It is, it is I
who am at your service.

382
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,628
Smithers, fetch us
some lemonade.

383
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,589
(grunting)

384
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,965
(panting)

385
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,550
All they had was
Sunnytime Pink.

386
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,761
Premix? I beg your
forgiveness, lad.

387
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,804
Smithers, pour it
down your pants.

388
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,975
Now, squish about
in those pants,

389
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,310
rewetting every hour.

390
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,358
Come with me.

391
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,902
You know, Master Simon,

392
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,613
I too was once the youngest
in a wealthy family.

393
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,740
You were once the youngest
of something?

394
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,867
But fortune ended up
smiling on me

395
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,662
while snuffing the life
from my siblings.

396
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,497
My older brother was trampled
by a horse.

397
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,540
My sister died
of a poisoned potato.

398
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,501
My twin was shot.
That girl was stabbed.

399
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,252
He ate
another poisoned potato.

400
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,963
Spontaneous combustion.
Fell down a well.

401
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,130
Potato. Potato,

402
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,091
and impaled
on the Chrysler Building.

403
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,550
Wow, only you survived.

404
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,718
(gasps)

405
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,388
Which means
the entire fortune went to you.

406
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,223
Yes, funny that.

407
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,975
A word of caution,
young Woosterfield:

408
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,936
watch out
for those closest to you.

409
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,270
Devon and Quenly?

410
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,397
You don’t know
when they’ll strike--

411
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,316
a boating accident,
a mishap during a ski trip--

412
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,985
but rest assured,
one way or another,

413
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,945
they will do you in.

414
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,530
Oh, my God.

415
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,782
Simon set me up.

416
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,993
And all this time
I thought he wanted the life

417
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,328
of a stranger
he met in the bathroom.

418
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,414
Now, would you care
to continue this conversation

419
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,456
on the teeter-totter?

420
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,458
(grunting)

421
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,627
Why won’t you come down?

422
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:47,631
I told you I only weigh as
much as my clothes and keys.

423
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,054
Hmm...

424
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,977
So I looked down the barrel
of my Winchester rifle,

425
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:05,357
I pulled the trigger,
and I shot that buffalo.

426
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,359
You shot a buffalo?

427
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,235
(sputtering):
You were listening?

428
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,862
(groans)

429
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,822
That means I’ve got to come up
with an ending

430
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,033
for this
nonsense.

431
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,492
(whispering):
Bart, what are you doing?

432
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,911
Politely listening
to our grandfather.

433
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,038
Huh.

434
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,498
It was the war to end all wars,

435
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,250
but Pepsi would not give up.

436
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,961
They continued
to challenge Coke.

437
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,087
(yelps)

438
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:27,963
Okay, listen, you.

439
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,381
I don’t know
who you are

440
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,176
or what you’ve done
with the real Bart, but...

441
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,720
God help me,
I want him back.

442
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:38,307
I don’t know
what you’re talking about.

443
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,435
Oh. The real Bart would have
thrown me out the window.

444
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,145
He would have
defenestrated you?

445
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,272
You’re just digging yourself
even deeper.

446
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,608
(grunting)

447
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,234
Come on, Bart.
You’ve got to get out of here.

448
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,944
Pack like you’ve never
packed before.

449
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,156
You know,
I have never packed before.

450
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,908
(grunting)

451
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,076
This is hard.

452
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,535
So, you’re packing.

453
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,536
You must have already heard.

454
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,829
Heard what?

455
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,955
We’re going to Aspen.

456
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,540
On a little ski trip.

457
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,459
Ski trip?

458
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,628
You won’t know how they’ll
strike-- a boating accident...

459
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,629
(sighing in relief)

460
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,630
...a ski trip.

461
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,340
(screams)

462
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,342
MARGE (to tune of "Loving You"):

463
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:18,055

468
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,651
Mom, "Bart" has something
to tell you.

469
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,402
(groans)

470
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,280
I don’t like the look
of those air quotes.

471
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,491
So now Bart is on
his way to Aspen,

472
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,784
where they’re going
to try to kill him.

473
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,244
Thank you, future Bart,

474
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,371
for traveling back
through time to warn us.

475
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,299
Boy, Aspen
sure is ritzy.

476
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,968
Even the winos look better.

477
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,762
Uh, we’re champagnos.

478
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,222
Who wants a mimosa?

479
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,266
Uh...

480
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,893
this trail is for
experienced skiers.

481
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,271
Which is what you’ll be
if you make it to the bottom.

482
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,605
Which you won’t.

483
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,731
-(grunts)
-(screams)

484
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,609
Soon he’ll be dead.

485
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,653
And we’ll split
the inheritance.

486
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,697
Yes, split.

487
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,157
Potato?

488
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,160
(gasps)

489
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,452
There’s Bart!

490
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,872
This looks like a job
for Captain Crazy.

491
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,833
Up, up, and away!

492
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,251
Oh, come on, gravity.

493
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,711
You used to be cool.

494
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:31,712
D’oh!

495
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,046
(yelling)

496
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,382
(both yelling)

497
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,466
Occupied.

498
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,428
(screaming)

499
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,849

500
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,309

00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,023
(sighs)

502
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,817
Two hot chocolates, please.

503
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,611
Are you guests at the lodge?

504
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,529
No.

505
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,614
(both yelling)

506
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,120
You know, I feel
sorry for you, kid.

507
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,498
Going back to that cold,
loveless family.

508
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,375
I’ll survive.

509
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,877
Your favorite, sir.

510
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,882
Hot fudge sundae with
gold leaf and diamond flakes.

511
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,676
Take me with you.

512
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,136
I’ll be anything
and everything you want.

513
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,805
Don’t leave me here with <i>them!</i>

514
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,517
I never thought I’d say this,
but I missed you guys.

515
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,061
Even what’s-her-name--
Lisa.

516
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,312
(growls)

517
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:36,318
Now we tuck in the tummy,
the tushy, and the tootsies.

518
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,653
(speaking gibberish)

519
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,279

520
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,281
(kisses)

521
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,786
This is the life.
