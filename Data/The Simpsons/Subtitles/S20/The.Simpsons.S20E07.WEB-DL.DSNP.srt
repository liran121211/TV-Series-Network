Okay, remember our deal--
everyone gets to return

00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,573
one Christmas present
with no hurt feelings.

30
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,784
I’m returning this
kitten calendar.

31
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,829
Um, I’m also returning
this kitten calendar.

32
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:01,913
Kitten calendar.

Hey, those are

34
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,960
That gives you
three extra kittens!

00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,506
That’s the last time
I get you guys

36
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,133
a Christmas present
at the last minute.

37
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,135
Man, those are ugly kittens!

00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,219
Mom, Dad!

39
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,221
Our mall got a Mapple store!

A Brainiac Bar!

43
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,438
My question is the
following statement:

44
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,399
Operating System 4.2

45
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,485

than a Tijuana anthill.

46
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,321
Did you get peanut butter
in your Ethernet port again?

47
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,533
No. I got mayonnaise
in the CD drive.

48
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,118
Hmm!

49
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,829
I see you’re
admiring our MyCube.

50
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,498
It’s fueled by dreams and
powered by imagination.

51
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,457
What does it do?

52
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,002
You should ask yourself,
"What can <i>I </i>do for it?"

53
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,879
Okay. What can I do for you?

54
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,255
Please, I’m begging you!

55
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,715
Sir, it’s not even
turned on yet.

56
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,841
But it’s glowing.

57
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,467
That light confirms
that it’s off.

58
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,513
I can’t afford any
of your products,

59
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,849
but can I buy some
fake white earbuds,

60
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,059
so people will think
I have a MyPod?

61
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,645
Sure, those are
called "MyPhonies."

62
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,356
Oh, and they cost $40.

63
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,693
Oh, I’ll never get
a Mapple anything.

64
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,862
KRUSTY:
I hate this MyPod!

65
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,615
I can’t watch movies
on a screen this small.

66
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,951
And the music today--
don’t get me started!

67
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,998

Come on, isn’t someone
going to get me started?!

71
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,007
Uh, let’s go, Teeny.

72
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,302
Maybe somebody at Old Navy
will get me started.

73
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,470
Here kid, you take it.

74
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,096

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,765
Oh, don’t thank me.

76
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:47,018

Jordan. That’s on some

134
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,108
Bashir, introduce me
to your new friend.

135
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,153
Bashir, you didn’t tell me
you had a sister.

Such a charmer.

137

Would you like to

138
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,618
Hey, I never refuse food
from strangers.

139
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,121
Okay, you’re new
to our school,

140
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,540
so here’s the deal:
we call Skinner, "Skin-rash,"

141
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,043
Mr. Wiener is "Mr. Whiner,"

142
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,129
and Groundskeeper Willie,
"Grounds-Creeper Stupid."

143
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,798
Ah, that’s
not clever!

144
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,342
And I have so many
aspects you can mock!

145
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,136
I’m poor, I’m dirty,
I can’t read or write,

146
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,846
I think movies
are real!

147
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,473
(laughing)

148
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,934
Okay, next, here’s the
food at the cafeteria

149
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,185
that will make you sick:

150
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,562
coleslaw, tuna,
all chowders and gumbos.

151
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,773
The only thing that’s
safe is the pork chops.

152
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,692
My religion says
I can never eat pork.

153
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,444
A different religion?!

154
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,904
Do not tell anyone that

155
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,114
because if the
bullies around here

156
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,281
find out that
you’re different...

157
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,449
JIMBO:
Who’s different?

158
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,954
What’s your name,
sweat stain?

159
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,914
Uh, Bashir.

160
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,165
"Bash here"?

161
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,292
I love a kid that
comes with directions.

162
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,340
Okay, Bashir.

163
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,386
Tell us where you came from
so we can punch you back there.

164
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,012
I’m going to punch
you extra hard

165
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,306
’cause I secretly
think you’re cute.

166
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,599
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

167
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,726
You can’t just whale
on him because he’s--

168
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,270
What religion
are you anyway?

169
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,313
-Muslim.
-Oh, boy.

170
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,607
You’re the reason I can’t carry
toothpaste on an airplane!

171
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,152
Ow!

172
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,113
Look, guys,
everyone’s different.

173
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,990
Jimbo, you’re Christian,
Dolph, you’re Jewish,

174
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,575
and, Kearney, your family’s
in that cult Moe started.

175
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,118
I had to join.

176
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,536
My mom’s doing the savior.

177
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,538
I mean, the one true Moe.

178
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,039
You’re the
one true mo.

179
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,083
(laughing)

180
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,086
(grunting)

181
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,674
Help me,
almighty Moe!

182
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,885
Can’t. I’m not
really a god.

183
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,220
I was just acting crazy
to get out of jury duty.

184
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,682
(Bashir and Bart laughing)

185
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,852
Look at Lisa Simpson,
over there by herself.

186
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,104
Not talking to us,
her best friends!

187
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,731
Do we hate her?

188
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,149
-Yes!
-Yes!

189
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,693
Lisa, we came to
tell you that we...

190
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,279
(gasps):
Is that a MyPod?

191
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,782
Yeah. I’ve already downloaded
so much incredible music!

192
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,409
Check out "Moon Dreams"

193

217
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,295
Marge, I installed
all the low-energy bulbs.

218
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,630
What have you done
with the old ones?

219
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,592
Disposed of them in an
environmentally friendly manner.

220

He’s got contacts,
changed color,

225
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,769
got a cool new catchphrase.

226
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,355
Salaam alaikum!

227
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,232
Dad, that’s Bashir,
my new friend.

(doorbell rings)

229
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,194
Bart forgot
this, sir.

230
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,946
Sir?

231
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,781
That’s the kind of
respect you’d have to

232
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,867
strangle out of
an American kid.

233
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,827
You know, Bart
never told me

234
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,495
he had a handsome
teenage brother.

235
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,039
(giggling)

236
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,291
Oh, uh, I’m really 38.

237
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,585
38 waist I might believe.

238
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,712
(shrieking, giggling)

239
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,507
Hey, Carl, got any idea what
direction Mecca’s in?

240
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,009
Why don’t you ask Homer?

241
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,720
He ought to know, by dint
of his son’s new friend.

242
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,846
(laughing)

243
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,931
Hey, Bashir’s great.

244
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,100
If Derek Jeter married
Mariah Carey--

245
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,102
it wouldn’t last--
but I bet they’d have

246
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,520
a kid like him.

247
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,730
Homer, this
is serious.

248
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,440
This Bashir kid
is Muslim,

249
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,025
and therefore
up to something.

250
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,902
Oh, I can’t believe
that till I see

251
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,988
a fictional TV program
espousing your point of view.

252
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,782
All right.

253
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,784
For the last time, Fayed,

254
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,410
where did you hide
the nerve gas?!

255
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,163
Under your Statue of Liberty’s
dress!

256
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,706
And she loved it!

257
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,041
Oh, my God.

258
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,292
What can I do?

259
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,835
Well, if you want
to stop Bashir

260
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,545
and his war
on American principles,

261
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,547
you could discriminate
against his family

262
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,007
in employment and housing.

263
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,301
That’s pretty patriotic,
but I got a better idea.

264
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,594
Invite ’em over.

265
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,429
A little dinner,
a little dessert,

266
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,806
and then you
Jack Bauer ’em

267
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,516
into giving you
all their secrets.

268
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,517
(evil laughter)

269
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,229
I guess I have no choice.

270
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,525
Homie, it’s very
open-minded of you

271
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:36,028
to have Bart’s Muslim friend’s
Muslim family over.

272
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,238
Here’s the
plan, Marge.

273
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,948
You keep them talking.

274
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,118
I’ll be listening
and quietly judging.

275
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,328
(doorbell rings)

276
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,039
The doorbell will tell
you when they’re here.

277
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,419
So, how did you two meet?

278
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,336
(chuckles)

279
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,546
We met while studying

280
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,549
at Jordan University
of Science and Technology.

281
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,967
Ah, interesting.

282
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,343
Why, just the other day,

283
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:03,681
I was reading that science
is used to make bombs.

284
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,561
Now, bait the trap.

285
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,439
Why don’t I get us
dessert?

286
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,941
(chuckles)

287
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,026
I made us
a little cake.

288
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,195
Care to cut?

289
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,864
Watch this,
Lenny.

290
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,115
Not now.

291
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,242
I got soap in my eyes.

292
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,785
No, thank you.

293
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,995
What’s the matter?

294
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,664
Don’t like the taste
of freedom?

295
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,623
Dad, these people
are my friends.

296
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,125
Don’t fear them

297
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,752
just because they have
a different religion,

298
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,837
a different culture, and
their last name is Bin Laden.

299
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,505
Young man,
you do not respect us

300
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,048
by disrespecting
your father.

301
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,800
I like the way
you Italians think.

302
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,927
Shut up,
old man.

303
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,180
I think it is time
for us to go.

304
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,181
Mm-hmm.

305
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,599
That’s it.

306
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,601
Ruin a perfect evening.

307
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,769
You’re teaching Bart

308
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,563
a terrible lesson
of intolerance.

309
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:53,564
I’m sorry.

310
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,024
It’s just so
fun and easy

311
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,984
to judge people
based on religion.

312
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:00,404
Well, I want you to go over
to their house and apologize.

313
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:04,700
But we’re the more powerful
country for a few more years.

314
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,412
Okay, I’ll apologize.

315
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,539
Up-bup-bup-bup!

316
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,249
Don’t eat that,
sweetie.

317
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,002
It’s poison.

318
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,510
I am sorry I suspected you

319
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,054
of being soulless murderers
of innocent children.

320
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,139
I hope we can move
past this and...

321
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,771
(gasping):
Dynamite?

322
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,648
They <i>are </i>terrorists.

323
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,858
Must leave quietly.

324
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,486
(trash clattering,
leaf blower roaring)

325
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,488
(loud metallic clattering)

326
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,448
(clattering)

327
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,910
So far, so good.

328
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:53,958
Marge!

329
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,125
I was right!

330
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,878
Everybody is
whatever I think they are.

331
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,505
I saw them
unloading dynamite.

332
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,090
(sighs)

333
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,217
Homer, I’m sure you
didn’t see anything.

334
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,385
Go to sleep.

335
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,719
All right, sweetie,

336
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,305
but if I wake up tomorrow,
we’ll discuss it.

337
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,270
(wind whistling)

338
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,193
BASHIR:
Hi, Homer!

339
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,988
Hmm.

340
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,447
(gasps)

341
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,448
You rubbed?

342
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,449
You must like me.

343
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,159
You really,
really like me.

344
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,745
Good morning, Ramadan!

345
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,539
Come to Crazy
Fayeddie’s!

346
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,916
Our prices
are Hussein!

347
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,794
Here’s... Genie!

348
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,795
(giggles)

349
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,630
-Now do Flanders.
-No.

350
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,342
Now I will destroy your
decadent Western society.

351
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,137
(1940s-style music playing)

352
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,775
No...!

353
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,027
Hmm.

354
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,029
Usually that ends the dream.

355
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,907
(snoring)

356
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,285
The power of dreaming has
convinced me the threat is real.

357
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,037
(panting)

358
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,122
(doorbell rings)

359
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,791
Delivery for
Lisa Simpson.

360
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,792
(gasps)

361
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,003
It’s a gift from Mapple.

362
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,297
Oh, such beautiful packaging.

363
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,508
I never thought
a company could be my soul mate.

364
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,053
Oh, it’s my first MyBill.

365
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,097
$1,200?!

366
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:36,352
But I only downloaded...
1,212 songs.

367
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,770
(groans)

368
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,611
I got to prove
the genie was right.

369
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,112
Off to work.

370
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,616
Sometimes I wish you would
quit that awful business.

371
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,118
But I love blowing up buildings.

372
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,079
Oh, my God.

373
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,413
Safely and legally,

374
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,666
in order to make room
for new buildings.

375
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:02,544
Darling, I think
you are working much too hard.

376
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,465
Yes, I am killing myself,
but it is all for the profit,

377
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,551
and after the explosion,
I will be in a better place.

378
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:14,139
That corner office
with the downtown view.

379
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,274
(doorbell rings)

380
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,069
Oh, it’s you.

381
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,570
What do you want?

382
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:32,366
I want to apologize for
being such a jerk at dinner,

383
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,952
and I thought the best
way to do that would be

384
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,788
to come to your house
and poke around.

385
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,540
Mr. Simpson,
I accept your apology.

386
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,916
Good-bye.

387
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,292
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

388
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,920
I read somewhere your people
are hospitable to guests.

389
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:45,921
Is that true?

390
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,715
(sighing):
Yes.

391
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,675
Praise be Oliver.

392
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,385
That’s Allah.

393
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,096
Yeah... we’ll look
it up in the Corona.

394
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,100
So... now
that we’re alone,

395
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,186
um... death to America,
right?

396
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,230
Homer, why are
you really here?

397
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,732
Oh, look at that.

398
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,108
We’re out of almond paste.
Don’t get up.

399
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,443
I’ll grind
the almonds myself.

400
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,822
A computer.

401
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,908
(computer chimes)

402
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,577
I’m in.

403
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,169
Springfield Mall?

404
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,923
They’re going to blow it up.

405
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,468
Homer, I don’t hear
almond grinding.

406
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,595
(singsongy):
Just listen.

407
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,306
I’m grinding them now.

408
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,475
(imitates grinder)

409
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,852
Ow, my finger!

410
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,812
Ooh, here comes the ambulance.

411
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,106
(imitates European
ambulance siren)

412
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,025
My, you’re a handsome fellow.

413
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,152
(in accent):
Just get in the ambulance,
Mr. Simpson.

414
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,570
We’ll see to your finger.

415
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,863
(in normal voice):
Why, thank you.

416
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,491
(imitates European
ambulance siren)

417
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,492
-(thuds)
-Ow, my finger!

418
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,789
Everyone, get out!

419
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,749
Run for your lives!

420
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:07,711
Run for your--
uh, stay where you are.

421
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,255
Bart!

422
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,761
(gasping):
Boy, don’t blow up this mall.

423
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,222
It has the cookie store
that gives free samples.

424
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,685
I can’t believe

425
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,063
your dad gets paid
to blow stuff up.

426
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,024
Actually, Bart, my job is
about math and engineering.

427
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,027
Every calculation is to make
sure the explosion is safe.

428
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,737
Did you factor in
one bald idiot?

429
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,781
No, I...

430
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,699
USA, USA!

431
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,867
USA!

432
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,745
(grunting)

433
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,670
(explosion)

434
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,633
Dad, it was an empty building.

435
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,677
It was supposed to come down.

436
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,011
What about the bridge?

437
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,888
That was supposed
to open tomorrow.

438
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,974
Did we really need
a bridge there?

439
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,600
The Duff Brewery
is on that island.

440
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,399
I’ll save you!

441
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,026
(spy theme music playing)

442
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,370
(Homer chuckles)

443
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,623
That banner has really paid
for itself over the years.

444
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,417
We accept
your apology.

445
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,211
Lisa, add another name
to our Christmas card list.

446
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,881
(whispering):
Next to our Jewish friends.

447
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,049
Where is Lisa?

448
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,718
She said something about
"the bottom of the ocean"

449
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,219
and "be back in a month."

450
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,809
<i>FEMALE VOICE:</i>
<i>Welcome to Mapple Headquarters.</i>

451
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,104
<i>The cost of this journey</i>
<i>will be added to your bill.</i>

452
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,651
Come on... come on.

453
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,652
Yes!

454
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,571
16 million results.

455
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,698
Mr. Mobbs, there’s a surface
dweller here to see you--

456
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,075
MyTunes user
JazzGal62.

457
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,702
Hmm... oh, Lisa Simpson.

458
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,454
Send her in.

459
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,082
Mm-hmm.

460
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,084
Lisa, it’s insanely
great to see you.

461
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,837
Um, Mr. Mobbs,

462
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:18,217
I sort of downloaded
too many songs onto my MyPod,

463
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,220
and I don’t have the money
to pay for them.

464
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,472
And do you think
you could consider

465
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,140
a reduced payment plan?

466
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,558
I’m sorry.

467
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,977
I know our posters say
"Think differently,"

468
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,647
but our real slogan
is "No refunds."

469
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,482
(sniffling):
Oh...

470
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:37,778
can’t you open your Mapple menu
and click on the compassion bar?

471
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,112
Oh, please.

472
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,783
Lisa, how would you
like to work for Mapple?

473
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,369
(gasping):
Would I ever.

474
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,454
Think differently.

475
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,498
Think
differently.

476
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,959
Think differently.

477
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,126
(sighs)

478
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,129
