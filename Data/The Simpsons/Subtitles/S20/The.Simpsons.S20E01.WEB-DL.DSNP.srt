00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,780
Woo-hoo!
St. Patrick’s Day.

8
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,782
I love how they made
the river green.

9
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,620
Actually, my nuclear
plant did that.

10
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,331
And now that you know,
your life is in danger.

00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:48,423
Greetings, fellow Irishmen
and lady Irishmen.

13
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:52,135
I, Joseph Fitzgerald
O’Malley Fitzpatrick O’Donnell

14
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,971
the Edge Quimby,
welcome you to Springfield’s

15
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,557
first booze-free
St. Patrick’s Day!

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,559
(booing)

17
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,020
Oh, come on, people.

18
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,981
Your drunken shenanigans
destroy this town every year.

19
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,443
And Ireland is so much more
than the imbibing of spirits.

20
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,528
The Irish gave the world
the paddy wagon,

21
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,030
the Shamrock Shake

22
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,699
and folk dancing
where you don’t move your arms.

23
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,701
(Irish folk music playing)

24
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,994
(groans):
Oh.

25
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,163
Where’s the IRA
when you need ’em?

26
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,457
We renounced the ways
of the gun and the bomb.

27
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,292
(passengers cheering)

28
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,127
(sighs)

29
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,171
In the old days, we would
have been all over that.

30
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,424

31
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,759

00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,775
Oh, no.

35
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,194
The Northern Irish
are also having a parade.

36
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,779
Two kinds of
Irish people?

37
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,905
What are they
fighting over,

38
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,573
who gets to sleep
in the bathtub?

39
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,492
Actually, those Prots
and Cathies

40
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,160
have hated each other
for centuries.

41
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,161
(sighs)

42
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,579
It always comes down to

43
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,666
transubstantiation
versus consubstantiation.

44
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,671
(growling, muttering)

45
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,798
Stop it! Both of you!

46
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,717
You have a common land,
a literature

47
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,636

St. Patrick’s Day

68
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,986
They took my cupcakes!

69
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,572
All right,
you unwanted miracles,

70
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,574
give back
the lady’s cupcakes.

71
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,075
You don’t have
the teeth for it.

72
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,702
Aye, but we could
gum the frosting.

73
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,329
If it’s good gummin’
you’re after,

74
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,039
wouldn’t you rather have
this lovely cabbage?

75
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,123
(children oohing)

76
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,041
(children chattering excitedly)

77
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,292
Cabbage!

78
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,460
Here you go, ma’am.

79
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,337
Not a sprinkle
nor Jimmy askew.

80
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,589
Thank you
so much, Mister...

81
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,216
Patrick Farrelly
at your service.

82
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,425
Marge Simpson.

83
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,427
Well, Mr. Farrelly,

84
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,638
the least I could do
is offer you a cupcake.

85
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,266
Hmm.

86
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,851
Mmm.

87
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,188
Light, moist, and such
a marvelous shape retention.

88
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,273
Marge, I own
a small bakery.

89
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,524
Will you bake for me?

90
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,319
Me? A professional
baker’s employee?

91
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,072
Imagine how different
my life would be.

92
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,701
Here we are
at school, kids.

93
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,370
Hey, what are those boxes
in the back?

94
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,287
Cakes!

95
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,163
-See ya.
-See ya.

96
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,748
I’ll do it!

97
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,250
Bless your heart.

98
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,251
You won’t regret it.

99
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,502
I already don’t.

100
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,046
Homer, I’ve got great news!

101
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,590
I’ll use my one phone call
to find out all about it!

102
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,973
Mulk request change of venue.

103
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:28,393
Green monster cannot
get fair trial

104
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,478
in Downtown Springfield.

105
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,064
Granted.

106
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,399
Homer Simpson?

107
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,233
You are a repeat offender.

108
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,276
Three-peat.

109
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,654
Bail is set at $25,000.

110
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,198
(scoffs)
I make that in a year.

111
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,574
I suggest you see
a bail bondsman.

112
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,454
Okay, Simpson,

113
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,707
all your information
checks out.

114
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,209
I called your boss to
verify your employment,

115
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,128
and he says you’re fired
for getting arrested.

116
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,587
(laughs)

117
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,464
You’d be amazed how
often that happens.

118
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,465
(groans):
Oh!

119
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,134
We’ll put up
your bail money.

120
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,512
Just pay us ten percent and
show up for your court date.

121
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,931
And if I don’t show up?

122
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,434
Then you got
to deal with me.

123
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,519
The name’s Wolf,
and I’m a bounty hunter.

124
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,979
If someone skips bail,

125
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,939
I track ’em down
and bring ’em back.

126
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,109
I also take a tooth,
make a plaster cast,

127
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,404
put it on this necklace, then
replace the tooth at my expense.

128
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,741
Well, time to go back
to my world of sleazy bars,

129
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,868
tattoo parlors
and greasy spoons.

130
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,786
What a great job.

131
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,705
And I could use
a job right now.

132
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,750
Whoa, not just anyone
can be a bounty hunter.

133
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,626
You have to pass
an online exam.

134
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,086
No, wait, they got
rid of that.

135
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,048
There is a $10 filing fee,
but you can get around it.

136
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,841
Congratulations!
You’re now a bounty hunter!

137
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,426
Mmm!

138
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,637
Okay, I’ve set my trap.

139
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:50,391
Now to scatter my cheese cubes
and the rats will come.

140
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,726
Condos!

141
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,519
Affordable condos!

142
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,729
Bail-jumpers welcome!

143
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,981
"Bail-jumpers welcome."

144
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,817
That’s refreshing, after
the cold shoulder we got

145
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,861
at the Townhomes
at Sterling Pointe.

146
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:02,945
(tires screeching)

147
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,114
Let’s not get too excited

148
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,742
till we find out if it’s
in a good school district.

149
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,911
Oh, so wait. Are we
telling people now?

150
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,538
Stop in the name
of a private citizen

151
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,749
with no connection to the law!

152
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:22,006
Now, are you gonna come quietly,
or do I have to...

153
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,509
(screams)
Now, let’s think about this.

154
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,762
If you shoot me,
I won’t be able to stop you,

155
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,514
and you’ll be free to go.

156
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,556
-(cocks gun)
-But...

157
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,934
someone may come after you.

158
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,019
Probably not,
given your reputation

159
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,604
for shooting people
who come after you.

160
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,356
What I’m trying to say is

161
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,817
not shooting me now

162
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,237
would be the biggest mistake
of your life.

163
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,449
(screams)

164
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,664
(screaming)

165
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,873
Oh!

166
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,291
Huh?

167
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,793
-Bullet-proof glass.
-Flanders?!

168
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,587
Yup, I’m just replacing
the front window of my store,

169
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,047
which was broken
in the riot.

170
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,465
(moans)

171
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,759
Young man, what would
your mother say

172
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,720
if she knew you were shooting
nice people in the brain?

173
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,681
She’d say that year off
from Princeton

174
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,267
was the worst decision
I ever made.

175
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,727
Well, son, if you take
responsibility for your actions,

176
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,689
this could be the start
of a better life for you.

177
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,982
Maybe you’re right.

178
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,233
Maybe I should just...

179
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,193
(muffled groaning)

180
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,364
This case is in the bag.

181
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,615
Homer, you could
have killed him!

182
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,326
I sure could have,
thanks to you.

183
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,036
(squeaking)

184
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,330
Now I can clearly see
potential customers

185
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,332
walk right past my store.

186
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,917
Enjoy your shopping
elsewhere!

187
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,420
Hey, Ned,
I brought you something.

188
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,255
(Homer chuckles)

189
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,631
Aw.

190
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,049
What the...?

191
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,634
It’s your share
of the money

192
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,219
for bringing
in that bail-jumper.

193
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,221
Ned, I never thought
I’d say this,

194
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,639
but we make a great team.

195
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,516
Us, a team?

196
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,894
As the salad said to the soup,
"I’m all mixed up."

197
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,104
We should be
bounty hunters together.

198
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,522
You’re kind and smart.

199
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,107
I’m cruel and strong.

200
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,109
Together, we’re nothing.

201
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,737
But together, we’re
the perfect bounty hunter.

202
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,072
Well, I could
use money,

203
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,241
but you have to promise
me something, Homer.

204
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,367
Sure. What is it?

205
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,454
We have to do everything
by the book.

206
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,957
And <i>you </i>have to promise
no diddilies or doodilies.

207
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,251
My friend, you have
a deal-arooney!

208
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,169
D’oh!

209
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,427
Mmm.

210
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,846
Mmm! Mm-hmm!

211
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,473
Mmm, mm-hmm!

212
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,225
Oh, Marge,

213
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,936
your talent with cakes
is a rare and precious thing.

214
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,772
Well, um, thanks, but
I’ve been wondering.

215
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,775
Why do you only have me
make spheres, rods,

216
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,360
and half-moon shapes?

217
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,529
Uh, well, Marge,
I’ll tell you, um...

218
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,030
(door bells tinkle)

219
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,491
...right after I talk
to these customers.

220
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,826
We’re going to
a bachelorette party

221
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,453
for a really
naughty girl.

222
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,454
-(chuckles)
-Yeah.

223
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,666
We need something
tasty <i>and </i>tasteless.

224
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,418
I’ve got just the thing,
courtesy of my newest baker:

225
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,379
freshly-frosted ass cake.

226
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,005
-Oh!
-Boy!

227
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,674
Oh, my God!

228
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,425
This is an erotic bakery!

229
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,806
-Mmm!
-Mmm!

230
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,766
Delicious!

231
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:22,019
Now, what do you have in the
way of a suggestive cannoli?

232
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,689
Oh, we have quite
a selection. Hmm.

233
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,357
-Oh, yes!
-(chuckling): Oh!

234
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,650
Oh. Oh, boy!

235
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,360
I’ll leave you
with the book.

236
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,448
How could you not tell me
this is an erotic bakery?!

237
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,616
Marge, calm down.

238
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,451
For as long as
there’s been baking,

239
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,744
there’s been
erotic baking.

240
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,663
It fills a need
and harms no one.

241
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,872
Harms no one?

242
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,709
(scoffs)
Explain that to...

243
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,294
Well, what about...

244
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,337
I think you forgot about...

245
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,547
Hmm.

246
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,591
My #1 customers
are married couples,

247
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,175
your friends and neighbors.

248
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,553
I just made a custom order
for the Hibberts.

249
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,680
It’s an exact replica
of the good doctor’s...

250
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,931
I don’t want to know!

251
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,516
It’s not what
you think it is.

252
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,684
Good.

253
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,102
It’s his penis.

254
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,354
That’s exactly
what I was thinking!

255
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,607
Marge, this is a
valuable public service.

256
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,358
Without your baking,

257
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,652
people like me will be
forced into back alleys,

258
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,779
repurposing Ho Hos
and Ding Dongs.

259
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,989
You have a great gift.

260
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,574
Don’t let it
go to waste!

261
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,076
Well, okay.

262
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,664
(crackling)

263
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,499
This Taser is awesome.

264
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,960
Finally, a practical use
for electricity.

265
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,338
Dear Lord, thank you for
creating so many evil criminals

266
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,672
for us to bring in.

267
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,799
And also, thank you
for my partner Homer, who...

268
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,468
-(crackling)
-Did you just
Taser my coffee?

269
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,636
Just warming it up.

270
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,638
Now to melt the cheese
in this croissant.

271
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,598
(crackling)

272
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,725
And get rid
of a little excess earwax.

273
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,976
-(crackling)
-(groaning)

274
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,646
And smoke a relaxing cigar.

275
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,898
(crackling)

276
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,941
Homer, can we take it easy
on the Taser?

277
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,652
No problem.

278
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,695
(whirring)

279
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,863
(gasps)
Our first bail-jumper!

280
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,031
Let’s roll.

281
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,283
-(crackling)
-(groaning)

282
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,202
Homer, take the Taser
out of your pants.

283
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,787
No. It looks cool! <i>D’oh!</i>

Daddy’s home!

00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,296
I brought you kids some stuff
from work!

301
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,881
Here you go, son.

302
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,508
Shell casings!

303
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,469
Whoa! There’s still bullets
in some of these!

304
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,013
Point them away from your
sisters when you hammer them.

305
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,557
Yes, sir!

306
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,350
What’d you
get for me?

307
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,061
Something for the sweetest
little scientist in the world.

308
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,063
A new chemistry set!

309
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,441
Dad, is this from a meth lab?

310
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,276
The biggest one in town.

311
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,278
This is evidence.

312
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,114
Evidence that I love
my little girl.

313
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,075
Marge, I brought you
some flowers!

314
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,201
A full dozen this time.

315
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,369
No tricks.

316
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,954
Oh, Homie.

317
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,206
I got you something, too.

318
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,002
A sterling silver
picture frame

319
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,087
with pictures of our kids in it.

320
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,047
Yes, for now.

321
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,216
I guess things are
working out pretty good

322
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,384
at your bakery job.

323
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,470
Maybe we could order
one of your cakes

324
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,429
for Lisa’s birthday.

325
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,597
How dare you?!

326
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,265
What’d you
do that for?

327
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,142
Sorry, sorry.
Muscle spasm.

328
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,393
(laughs)

329
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,478
I’m not convinced.

330
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,271
Still on the fence.

331
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,440
Now I believe you.

332
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,109
He’ll be here
sooner or later.

333
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,906
(crickets chirping)

334
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,909
(Homer humming)

335
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,786
So, how about a little
stakeout music?

336
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,246
Homer, I don’t think
we have the same musical tastes.

337
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,207
Well, I like AC/DC.

338
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,126
I like their Christian
cover band: AD/BC.

339
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,545

(bird singing)

347
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,235
Hmm, I’ve never seen anyone
eat pizza like that.

348
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,986
Oh, you’ve gotta try it.

349
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,696
This way,
the pepperonis stay intact

350
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,198
till they reach
your stomach.

351
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,158
Then, bam!

352
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,535
(yelps)

353
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,620
Man, that’s harder to swallow
than evolution.

354
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,664
You’ve got to roll it
from the point.

355
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,123
Here, let me show you.

356
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,087
Not bad.

357
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,422
Now let it unfurl
in your stomach.

358
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,091
-Oh!
-There he is.

359
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,426
(gasps)

360

361
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,017
Oh, kitten whiskers.

362
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,311
There’s one thing
he didn’t count on:

363
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,273
my reckless indifference
to human life.

364
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,024
(tires squealing)

365
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,737
Lord, in your mercy, could you
give my friend a stroke?

366
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,288
Seymour, those string beans
were cooked to perfection.

367
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,497
After 20 years,

368
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,541
I am finally starting
to like you.

369
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,458
Just wait for dessert, sir.

370
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,210
I made it with you in mind.

371
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,420
Outstanding.

372
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,713
I’ll just shut my eyes

373
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,257
and let you place it
before me.

374
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,217
(screaming)

375
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,136
MRS. SKINNER:
Seymour, what’s going on?

376
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,596
I’m coming down there!

377
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,514
Quick, we’ll have
to eat from each end.

378
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,766
We’ll know we’re safe
when our lips meet
in the middle.

379
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,147
(screaming)

380
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,733
Homer, you can’t drive a car
onto a subway.

381
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,610
You need a special sticker
just to bring a bike.

382
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,528
Have you no respect for the law?

383
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,863
Hey, it worked,
didn’t it?

384
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:09,366
Okay, smart guy,
you’re going in the bag.

385
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,118

386
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,745
Wait, I left a
sandwich in there.

389
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,790
Homer, no, you promised.

390
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,417
Everything was supposed
to be by the book.

391
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,835
You know what
your problem is?

392
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,379
You haven’t become as bad
as the people we chase.

393
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,797
This partnership is over.

394
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,424
I’ll tell you
what’s over.

395
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,509
This partnership!

396
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,802
You know, if you

397
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,721
take your foot
off the accelerator

398
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,848
going downhill,
you wouldn’t use so much gas.

399
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,393
(sighs)
I can’t take another word
out of you.

400
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,561
(gasping)

401
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,027
I can’t believe
Flanders dumped me.

402
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,278
Marge, do we have
any more

403
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,738
of your
extra-long Twinkies?

404
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,365
Oh, no!

405
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,826
Those were for Mr. Smithers’
commitment ceremony.

406
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,203
Marge, what’s going on?

407

(sighs)

408
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,957
Homie, I’ve got a
confession to make.

409
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,292
I’m an erotic baker.

410
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,378
-(gasps)
-I hid it all
in the one place

411
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,462
you’d never look.

412
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,925
Marge, I can see you
withholding sex

413
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,259
or withholding cake,

414
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,887
but withholding sexy cake?

415
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,681
I know we have
to move past this,

416
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,974
but I don’t see how.

417
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,353
Homie, what do you say
we go to bed?

418
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,564
You, me and the cake.

419
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,193
First, why don’t you and I
and the cake take a shower?

420
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,653
Ooh.

421
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,410

423
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,164
Lucky Jim, I’m out
of the bounty hunting business.

424
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,958
Not so fast, Ned.

425
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,836
I got one more bail-jumper
for you to pick up.

426
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,921
Forget it.
I am turning in my...

427
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,631
well, I don’t really
have anything to turn in.

428
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,049
So that’s that.

429
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,968
I suggest you call
Homer Simpson.

430
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,095
This is one jumper
that Homer can’t catch.

431
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,891
(gasps)
Homer?

432
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,560
Seems he never
showed up in court

433
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,353
on his Saint Patrick’s Day
arrest.

434
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,896
Not interested.

435
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,065
All right, if you
don’t want the job,

436
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,859
I’ll just give it
to one of these guys.

00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,576
I’m sure they’re all
competent professionals,

439
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,828
but, uh, you’d best
leave it to me.

00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,962
Hello, anybody home?

442
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,299
You jumped bail, Homer.

443
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,592
I got to bring you in.

What have you done to my family?

445
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,179
I figured a good time
to pick you up

446
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,930
was when they were
at Lisa’s recital.

447
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,515
And how did you know
I wouldn’t be there?

448
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,017
Lucky guess.

449
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,769
Well, you’ll never
take me alive.

you’ve treated me like dirt.

Yeah, but you hold on

the more I got
