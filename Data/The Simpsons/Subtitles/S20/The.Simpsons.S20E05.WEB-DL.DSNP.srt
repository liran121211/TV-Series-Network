Homie, let’s pick up
those hitchhikers.

30
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,846
They don’t look like
the stabby kind.

31
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,473
Mom, you said
all hitchhikers

32
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,433
were drug-crazed
thrill-seekers.

33
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:44,062
I said they were
thrill-crazed drug-seekers.

34
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,605
Don’t put words
in my mouth.

35
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,108
Thanks for stopping.

36
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,153
This is my girlfriend,
Beatrice.

Were we ever
that stupid?

41
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,082
Of course we were.

42
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,171
Marge, I thought
of a new thing.

43
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,589
It’s called
"biking out."

44
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,716
It’s a combination
of biking and making out.

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,884
I don’t know.

46
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,261
Come on.

47
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,804
All the teens on bikes
are doing it.

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,937

00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,067
Howdy-do, strangers.

51
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,570
Hop on in before you become
a couple runneth over.

52
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,821
Ned, are you sure?

53
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,030
They’re covered with mud.

54
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,448
And in that mud,

55
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,450
I’m planting the seed
of friendship.

56
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,494
(chuckles)
Name’s Ned Flanders.

57
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,954
As the elephant said
to the peanut vendor,

58
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:43,997
toss those in my trunk.

59
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,457
(whispering):
Marge, I love this guy.

60
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,709
Put her there,
muddy buddy.

61
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,960
Oh, he rhymes!

62
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,295
Oh, happy day.

63
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,631
So, are you two engaged?

64
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,966
Engaged to be engaged?

65
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,968
Well, we thought
we’d wait a little while.

66
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,887
Really, not married?

67
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,930
And you were bicycling
two abreast?

68
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,056
I wish.

69
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,516
We were bicycling to a lake.

70
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,726
(chuckles)
Wordplay.

71
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,144
Never cared for it.

72
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,812
But it’s never too soon
for you two

73
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,856
to join the
"I do" crew.

74
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,275
Now, I’m not saying
it’s all Jell-O with Cool Whip.

75
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,194
She’ll nag you.
She’ll try to change you.

76
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,653
You’ll be fighting
the same basic fight

77
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,822
for years and years and years...

78
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,575
Ned, don’t you think
you’re exaggerating just a bit?

79
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,244
I think I’d like to
finish my sentence.

80
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,871
And years.

81
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,832
Um, how long
have you two been married?

82
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,250
Since 2:00
this afternoon.

83
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,835
Welcome
to our honeymoon.

84
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,462
-Whoa.
-(groaning)

85
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,424
Marge Bouvier,
will you not marry me?

86
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,219
Homer Simpson,
I would be delighted

87
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,678
not to marry you.

88
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,348
Then, I now
pronounce us just dating.

89
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,517
(moaning)

90
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,186
I love kissing you.

91
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,605
I never want
to knock it off.

92
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,482
Knock it off!

93
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,984
How dare you expose my children
to your tender feelings.

94
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,361
Bart, don’t you dare
take your eyes

95
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,071
-off that GameBoy.
-Yes, sir.

96
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:00,865
Avast, you!

97
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,242
(guns firing, screaming)

98
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,451

99
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,161

101

(guns firing, screaming)

102
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,540
I’m cuckoo for killing stuff!

103
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,252
Video games:
the reason this generation

104
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,254
of Americans
is the best ever.

105
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,431
I can’t believe Homer
ruined another family picnic.

106
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,059
Hey, everybody pees in the pool.

107
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,436
Not from the diving board.

108
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,439
(grumbling):
Why did we have to have
these two jerks along?

109
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,941
You’re driving too fast.

110
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,693
You’re losing your hair.

111
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,944
You sneeze like a girl.

112
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,904
SELMA:
Your neck looks like
a sideways ass.

113
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:40,780
HOMER:
That’s it!

114
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,657
(tires screeching)

115
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,993
Eat gravel, hags!

116
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,745
Homer, that was rude
and shortsighted.

117
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,247
Patty and Selma
have the map.

118
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,374
I have the situation
under control.

119
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,584
The compass needle
is pointing east.

120
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,295
That’s the fuel gauge.

121
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,088
HOMER:
Uh-oh.

122
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,300
How many times do I
have to say I’m sorry?

123
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,051
You haven’t said
you’re sorry.

124
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,721
I know, I was hoping
the number might be zero.

125
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,057
(grumbling)

126
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,226
(doorbell ringing)

127
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,396
Can we use your phone?

128
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,398
Of course, it’s just past
the sushi bar,

129
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,733
behind the limbo pit,

130
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,484
right in front
of the blackjack table.

131
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,944
And feel free to stay.

132
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,362
We just put out the cheese.

133
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,614
We have cubes of yellow,
cubes of orange,

134
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,158
and cubes of orange
and yellow.

135
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,245
A really fun party
full of colored cheeses

136
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,788
and awesome stuff
to do?

137
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,124
Doesn’t seem like your
kind of thing, Marge.

138
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,168
(grumbles)
We’ll stay for one hand roll

139
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,419
or two nigiri.

140
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,588
Then, we have
to get back to the kids.

141
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,382
Oh, let my dad enjoy them
a little longer.

142
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,469
(Grampa laughing)

143
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,012
Stop!

144
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,014
(laughing):
Stop!

145
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,640
Where are the cookies?

146
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,808
I don’t remember.

147
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,851
Wrong answer.

148
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,312
(laughing miserably)

149
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,779
(grunting)

150
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,280
Oh, for me?

151
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,074
No, get two of your own.

152
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,700
(laughs)
You’re a funny one.

153
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,078
That’s strong.

154
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,371
Are you trying
to get me drunk?

155
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,663
No, I’m trying
to get <i>me </i>drunk.

156
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,915
(chuckling)

157
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,875
You know,
my horoscope said

158
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,877
I’d meet the man
of my dreams tonight.

159
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,004
Well, a horoscope
would never lie

160
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,672
to a pretty girl like you.

161
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,508
You are adorable.

162
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,134
Are you alone?

163
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,470
No, I’m talking to you
at this great party.

164
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,138
Well, then, would
you like to limbo?

165
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,057
Limbo?
You mean the dance

166
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,767
or that place where
unbaptized babies go?

167
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,810
Either way, I’m in.

168
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,020

Well, then, she can have
you all to herself!

182
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,303
(grumbling)

183
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,436
(whispering):
How about a sushi fight?

184
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,522
Sushi fight!!

185
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,523
Huh?

186
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,774
(all laughing)

187
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,401
These fish died
for nothing!

188
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,904
(laughter continues)

189
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,408
Homer Simpson,
I wish I’d never met you.

190
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,291
Thanks for the lift.

191
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,209
What a cute couple.

192
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,254
(whispering):
She’s gonna take him
for a lot of money.

193
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,341
Here we are.

194
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,096
A log cabin?

195
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,181
What am I, Davy Crockett?

196
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,932
Also, who’s Davy Crockett?

197
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,602
Kids, this place
has very special memories

198
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:58,978
for your mother and me.

199
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,062
Well, leaving
right now

200
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,689
will become a special
memory for me.

201
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:02,773
(giggling)

202
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,984
They have a pedal car.

203
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,069
(singsong):
Pedal cars suck.

204
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,155
(singsong):
They’re worse
than walking.

205
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,366
(singsong):
I’ll put 100 bucks
in your college fund.

206
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,702
(singsong):
I’ll take
ten bucks now.

207
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,663
(singsong):
I’ll steal it back
when you’re sleeping.

208
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,501
(wheels squeaking)

209
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,884
Well, when the sun
goes down,

210
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,427
it means God’s
gone to China

211
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,054
to watch over
those good folks.

212
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,056
Time for some shut-eye.

213
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,684
(chuckles)
Why, Flanders, you rogue.

214
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,062
All Marge and I need
are a queen-sized bed

215
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,189
and a king-sized
"Do Not Disturb" sign.

216
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,858
(growls seductively)

217
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,361
Sorry, Homer, I’m afraid
it’s separate accommodations

218
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,737
for you notly-weds.

219
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,988
What?

220
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,657
But I have urges.

221
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,492
That’s just your
trouser devil talking.

222
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,203
He’s not talking.
He’s yelling.

223
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,790
(sighs)

224
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,458
Good night, Marge.

225
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,043
(humming)

226
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,549
Sweet dreams,
my new best friend.

227
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,635
(humming)

228
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,178
(creaking)

229
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,889
(humming)

230
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,766
Oh, what better way
to celebrate our wedding night

231
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,227
than by keeping
an unmarried couple apart.

232
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,231
Oh, Maude.

233
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,400
Your dead grandmother’s pajamas.

234
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,068
You know what that does to me.

235
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,072
(gasps)

236
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,074
(sighs)

237
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,870
I never thought
I’d say this, but...

238
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,248
stupid Flanders.

239
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,875
There’s absolutely nothing
to worry about.

240
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,502
I’m in my own room,

241
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,338
being chaperoned
by an actual Christian.

242
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,549
Well, I just don’t trust
that Homer Simpson.

243
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,301
He’s that
rare combination

244
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,803
of up to something
and good for nothing.

245
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:56,846
(chuckling)

246
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:57,888
Good one.

247
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,473
We should put that
in the file.

248
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,978
(laughs)
Nice.

249
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,479
(both laughing)

250
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:10,359
(both laughing)

251
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,029
(laughing)

252
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,073
(humming)

253
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:20,077
(soft sobbing)

254
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:24,248
Madame, perhaps I can be
of some assistance.

255
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,417
But I can’t take
a dress from a man

256
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,794
who looks so good
and smells so clean.

257
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,130
Please... when you came
through the door tonight,

258
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,673
I instantly imagined you

259
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,884
in a ruched burgundy
bias-cut evening gown

260
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,218
with a wolverine hem

261
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,763
and a contrasting
cerise tulle décolletage.

262
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,348
Really, me?

263
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,432
You did?

264
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,642
Oh, yes,
with a pair

265
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,186
of saffron brocade
diamond mink pumps.

266
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,979
Oh.

267
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,898
Pumps are shoes.

268
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,691
That explains a lot.

269
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,569
Mm-hmm.

270
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,446
(grunts excitedly)

271
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,490
Marjorie,
you look beautiful.

272
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,325
Let me take you
for a ride.

273
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,702
Or, should I say, "glide"?

274
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,871
I’m just happy
you’re talking again.

275
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,540
You didn’t say a word
for 45 minutes.

276
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,300
Marge?

277
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,927
You don’t need her, baby.

278
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,012
Sylvia’s got everything
you want.

279
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,472
Do you have
a pineapple pizza?

280
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,557
Pineapple <i>and </i>pepperoni.

281
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,643
Oh. This is all
going so fast.

282
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,939
We should be getting
back to the party.

283
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,982
Marjorie, that party
was beneath a woman

284
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,777
of your elegance
and sophistication.

285
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,570
You... Oh, look,
a budget motel!

286
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,372
I see the word vacancy is lit,
and the word no is not.

287
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,041
Let us pray the no
is not broken, huh?

288
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,501
(groans)

289
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,212
(crickets chirping)

290
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,090
Alberto, I’m not sure
if this is such a good idea.

291
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,883
Uh, uh, uh!
First we make love,

292
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,094
then we decide
if it was a good idea.

293
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,387
That’s the European way.

294
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,521
I came here once
with Marge.

295
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,982
Are you Marge, Sylvia?

296
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,609
Homer, I can be whoever
you want me to be.

297
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,783
I want you to be Marge.

298
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,660
(Marge sighing)

299
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,078
Marge?!

300
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,955
Mmm, mmm,
mmm, mmm...

301
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,498
HOMER:
Marge, is that you?

302
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,083
(gasps)
My husband!

303
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,377
Why do married women
always have husbands?

304
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,712
(grunting)

305
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,921
Aw!

306
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:36,964
Ooh!

307
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,299
Aah!

308
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,717
(grunting)
Marge,

309
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,093
what are you doing here?

310
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,429
Uh the same thing
you’re doing here.

311
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,389
You better not be!

312
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,849
I mean, great!

313
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,518
We both came to rekindle
our precious memories

314
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,188
of when we were young
and in love, right?

315
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,522
We sure did.

316
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,899
Rekindle, rekindle.

317
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,066
Okay, let’s go.

318
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,276
Oh, oh, oh,

319
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,736
I have a better idea.

320
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,280
Let’s spend the night
together right here.

321
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,909
Fine, but I don’t
want to sleep

322
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,786
in the same room
with that chest.

323
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,205
I feel the same way
about that lamp.

324
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,708
Okay, but first the chest.

325
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,126
Okay.

326
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,212
(grunting)

327
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,506
(sighs)

328
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,049
There you are!

329
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,759
Homie, what’s taking so long?

330
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,886
Listen, you’re a classy lady
and a great sushi fighter,

331
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,304
but you’re going
in the box.

332
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,347
(whimpers)

333
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,473
MARGE:
Homie?

334
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,141
Coming, Marge!

335
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,143
(singsong):
Mmm, mmm!

336
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,020
(door squeaks)

337
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,857
(door squeaks)

338
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,109
(squeaking)

339
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,154
Good evening.

340
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,656
-I am Alberto.
-Sylvia.

341
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,492
Let’s get out of this chest
and go have a drink.

342
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,952
Actually, I am quite
comfortable here.

343
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,204
There is a flask of
cognac in my pocket.

344
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,831
Do you think
you can reach it?

345
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,998
SYLVIA:
Okay.

346
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,542
Uh, is this it?

347
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,627
ALBERTO:
No, but don’t
stop twisting.

348
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,379
(both laughing)

349
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:02,007
Now let’s spend the rest of
the night making sweet, sweet...

350
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,217
(sighs)

351
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,260
Kids?!

352
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,553
(Homer and Lisa giggling)

353
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,638
I’m through baby-sitting
these monsters!

354
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,931
Good night.

355
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,349
(snoring)

356
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,226
We won!
He’s asleep!

357
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,769
And we’ll stay
up forever!

358
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,063
(both humming)

359
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,189
Oh.

360
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,732
(snores)

361
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,818
(laughing):
Well, that takes care
of those three.

362
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:24,363
Want to go
for a lakeside snuggle?

363
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,490
Homer Simpson,
you devil!

364
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,701
-Mmm...
-Mmm...

365
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,997
(laughing):
Well, that takes care
of those three.

366
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,375
Want to go play
some Lakeside Boggle?

367
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,128
Homer Simpson,
you devil!

368
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,462
(giggles)

369
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,590
But I think we
should unpack first.

370
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,926
Hmm. All right.

371
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,304
The trick is to ease them off.

372
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,431
(whipping)

373
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,557
(screaming)

374
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,559
(grunting)

375
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,481
What is this dump?

376
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,485
Ah, Ruthie, this dump is where
your mother and I met.

377
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,530
It was a tale
of betrayal, redemption,

378
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,241
and a lovely
continental breakfast.

379
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,951
(Homer whimpering)

380
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,828
Homer, those are
our wedding bungees!

381
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,204
(Homer grunts)

382
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,289
(yowling)

383
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,582
Marjorie?!

384
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,791
Homer?

385
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,543
It’s so good to see you.

386
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,712
We owe you two
a debt of thanks.

387
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,256
Homer, if I hadn’t come
to this motel with you,

388
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,674
I never would have
met Alberto.

389
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,259
(gasps)

390
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,887
And Marjorie, if you had
completed your seduction of me,

391
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,764
I never would
have met Sylvia.

392
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,390
(gasps)

393
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,809
I can’t believe one
of the most beautiful moments

394
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,896
in our marriage
is based on lies!

395
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,731
You’re just as bad as me!

396
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,859
And you used to be better,
so that makes you worse!

397
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,112
I don’t think we can ever
trust each other again.

398
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,240
Ruthie, kick me away
from this nightmare.

399
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,368
Okay.

400
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,204
I wish I’d never met you!

401
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,914
-Or you!
-(Bart and Lisa giggling)

402
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,671
Why can’t you just admit
we’re lost?

403
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,006
I’ll tell you what’s lost:
your sense of adventure.

404
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,801
Just ask those guys
for directions.

405
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,637
Hmm. Anti-nuclear activist
Dr. Helen Caldicott?

406
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,806
Director Julie Taymor?

407
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,557
Do <i>you </i>love these women?

408
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,101
They’re okay,
I guess.

409
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,061
Let’s just skip to the
Windsor knot instructions.

410
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,646
LISA:
Excuse me, boys.

411
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,065
My brother is lost,
and kind of a jerk.

412
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,776
If he’d brought a map
of the grounds as I suggested,

413
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,403
-then we would...
-(grunting)

414
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,363
Lisa, do you know
why I spend every day

415
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,572
after school
in detention?

416
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,574
So I don’t have to
come home to you!

417
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,370
Oh, Bart, don’t say things
you can’t take back.

418
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,579
It’s out there.

419
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,872
-Deal with it!
-(sleepy, baby chatter)

420
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,749
Oh, great.
Now you woke the baby.

421
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,293
I told you we should have
left her with your mother!

422
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,463
My God, Bart,
what happened to us?

423
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,674
We grew up.

424
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,598
So, I’m sure
you missed Marge last night.

425
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,184
Yeah. I missed her,
like, five times.

426
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,686
What a charming single entendre.

427
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,604
Now, look,
I know marriage is scary,

428
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,481
but if you really think
she’s the one,

429
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,316
it gives you two a shot
at forever.

430
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,735
Forever?

431
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,194
That would be awesome.

432
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,321
Okay, here she comes.

433
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,198
Why don’t you take Marge
for a walk,

434
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,325
open your heart
and see what pours out?

435
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:19,079
I suppose you and Maude
will be coming along, as well?

436
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,457
(chuckles)
Don’t you think
I got better things to do

437
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,500
on my honeymoon
than spy on you two?

438
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,877
(static crackles)

439
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,962
Red Dog, this is Mustache One.

440
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,256
We have possible male/female
interaction.

441
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,133
Be prepared to terminate
inappropriate contact.

442
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,303
(clicking)

443
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,804
Ready with the ice water.

444
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,139
<i>NED:</i>
<i>Lock onto his wiener.</i>

445
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,891
We have wiener-lock.

446
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,643
Marge, when I’m with you,
I get that feeling

447
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,230
like when I got that smart kid’s
report card by mistake,

448
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,609
and for a minute,
I thought I had all As,

449
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,904
and that my name
was Howard Simberg.

450
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,947
You make me feel
that way, too.

451
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,909
I know we’ll get married
some day, and to prove it,

452
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,744
I’ll carve our names
on this tree

453
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,914
so all who are hopelessly lost
in the woods can see it.

454
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,668
Oh, I <i>hate </i>other people’s love.

455
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,797
(grunting)

456
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,425
(mumbling)

457
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,177
(grunts)

458
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,804
Oh!

459
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,102
(mumbling)

460
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,438
So that <i>wasn’t </i>Marge’s glider

461
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,941
parked outside the motel
five years ago!

462
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,359
I’m getting out of this marriage

463
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,902
while I’m still young
and handsome.

464
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,571
Hmm?

465
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,073
Oh!

466
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,324
(sniffles)

467
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,575
4EVER.

468
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,327
(sobbing)

469
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,747
I couldn’t even keep a promise
I made to a tree.

470
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,541
Maybe it’s not too late!

471
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,543
Maybe I can <i>still </i>save our love.

472
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,545
If I just show her
that carving.

473
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,629
(whimpering)

474
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,215
(grunting)

475
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,592
(grunting)

476
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,677
Huh? What are
you doing?

477
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,928
Saving our marriage!

478
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:58,846
(grunts)

479
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,681
Don’t be silly.

480
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,476
Our marriage can weather
any storm, just like this tree.

481
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,228
(rumbling)

482
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,856
-(crackling)
-(whimpering)

483
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,649
Oh! Help!

484
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,693
Fat man hanging from a tree!

485
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,779
Uh-uh.

486
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,239
That’s for fires.

487
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,325
Take my hand!

488
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,036
I don’t want to let go
of our special carving!

489
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,664
Homer, our marriage
isn’t on a piece of bark!

490
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:26,999
It’s in us!

491
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,333
Now take my hand!

492
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,921
(both grunting)

493
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,464
(gasps)

494
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,508
(Homer screaming)

495
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,388
D’oh!

496
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,681
Oh!

497
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,224
(sobbing)

498
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,227
(screaming)

499
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,770
(grunts)
(gasps)

500
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,565
Marge, I don’t want to die
with us mad at each other.

501
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,858
Me neither, Homie.

502
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,277
I know parts of our marriage
are based on lies,

503
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,862
but so are a lot
of good things:

504
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,322
religion, American history.

505
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,741
I know. We had a fight.
We were both tempted.

506
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,201
We’re human.

507
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,578
The important thing is
we love each other.

508
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,787
Aw.

509
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,080
-Mmm!
-Mmm!

510
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,582
-(gasp)
-(gasp)

511
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,919
Now we wait for the river
to freeze.

512
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,004
If my theory of global cooling
is correct.

513
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,757
Hey, you guys want a lift
in my pedal boat?

514
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,217
It’s not a pedal boat.

515
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,719
It’s a pedal <i>car</i>
that Bart drove into the river.

516
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,472
Because he knows a shortcut
that’s not on the map.

517
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,350
How’d you like a shortcut
to the bottom of the river?

518
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,769
If it’s <i>your </i>shortcut,
I’ll be high and dry.

519
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,813
(grunts)

520
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,023
(squeaking)

521
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,233
-Mmm...!
-Mmm...!

522
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,317
Knock it off
back there.

523
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,526
But we’re
married.

524
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,736
Okay, but
keep it PG.

525
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:38,987
How about R?

526
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,364
-PG-13.
-(whoops)

527
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,032
Adult situations!

528
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,076
(moaning and giggling)

529
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,369
Hey.

530
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,338
(squeaking)

531
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,675
(Homer yawning)

532
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,093
Ow!

533
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,552
