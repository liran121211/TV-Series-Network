Out of gas?!
But how?

16
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,965
I put a dollar in this morning

17
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,634
and we’ve only driven 90 cents.

18
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,803
You had to drive
with the windows down,

19
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,763
didn’t ya, Rockefeller?

20
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:40,183
Now get some gas while I read
my bingo strategy guide.

21
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,102
Let’s see, B-12...

00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,864
I did it!

26
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,242
Bonehead.

This counts
as a parent-teacher conference!

31
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,554
Whoa! Am I seeing this right?

32
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,391
I am.

33
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,892

00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,312
Talk to me.

37
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,857
Skinner’s doing what?

38
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,191

00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,651

I’ll clean you up good,

48
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,972
Where’s Simpson?

49
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,432
I couldn’t get
a hold of him.

50
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,474
No cell phone.

51
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,393
But if I know Bart,

52
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,770
he’s busy doing
something awesome.

53
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,398
I don’t know why
I agreed to this.

54
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,859
Because you love the taste
of my imaginary tea.

55
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,235
(slurps)

56
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,070
Oh, you’re right.

57
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,572
(gulping)

58
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,781
Hey, Spaz!

59
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,450
While you were
here spazzing yourself,

60
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,743
you totally missed out.

61
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,536
Missed out?
I didn’t miss out.

62
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,038
What’d I miss out on?

63
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,289
(gasps)

64
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,498
(grunts):
Huh?

65
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,917
(groans):
Ugh...

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,834
Oh.

67
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,338
I wish I had a cell phone.

68
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,256
Here’s an imaginary
cell phone.

69
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,716
What, do you think
I’m crazy?

70
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,348
Mom, even Milhouse
has a cell phone.

71
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,891
Your son is lamer
than Milhouse.

72
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,351
What does that say about <i>you?</i>

73
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,646
Sweetie, we can’t afford
to get you a cell phone.

74
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,191
As it is, I’m buying frozen peas
on installments.

75
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,694
(groans)

76
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,158
Oh...

77
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,661
Oh, I’m never gonna get
a cell phone.

78
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,621
And I’m never gonna go
to Machu Picchu.

79
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,706
In this family, you get
used to disappointments.

80
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,712
How am I ever gonna get
a cell phone?

81
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,339
Ow!

82
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,466
(groans)

83
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,261
(growls)

84
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,768
Is this your ball?

85
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,186
Why, yes, it is.

86
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,145
(chuckles)

87
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,438
Here you go.

88
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,232
Don’t tell me
where I go.

89
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,441
A dollar?

90
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,442
What for?

91
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,152
It’s the least I can do.

92
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,238
These balls cost
five dollars new.

93
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,032
So I can get a dollar
for every ball I find?

94
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,535
Then if a cell phone costs $100,

95
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,953
how many balls do I need?

96
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:50,373
This is why my kids go
to private school.

So it’s you!

109
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,367
You’re the one who’s been
poaching on me territory.

110
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,535
Groundskeeper Willie?

111
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,745

I’m Greenskeeper Willie.

113
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,166
Your ball-scavenging
days are over.

114
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,793
And those orphan
golf balls belong to me.

115
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,337
Ah! Dimpled gold.

116
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,755
I’m rich.

117
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,632
Now I won’t have to pleasure
a country-club wife

118
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,760

121
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,771
Oh, great!

122
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,314
We’ve got to wait
for Denis Leary.

123
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,192
Hey, Leary, if you want
to have a tea party,

124
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,485
go back to Boston.

125
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,487
(laughing)

126
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,488
Boston.

127
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,575
Come on, Ice Age.
Take the shot.

128
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,160
<i>Ice Age </i>was the name
of the film.

129
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,245
I played Diego,
the vicious saber-toothed tiger,

130
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,331
who, guess what, has a heart.
Now shut up

131
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,665
or I’ll have you all kicked out
of show business.

132
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,875
ALL:
Ooh.

133
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,170
(cell phone ringing)

134
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,838
Damn it!

135
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,717
Huh? A cell phone!

136
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,055
It’s mine!

137
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,431
Aw, cool.

138
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,058
You can even
watch commercials on it.

139
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,856
(dialing)

140
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,192
Hey, Milhouse,
guess where I’m calling from?

141
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,611
Well, I know you don’t
have a cell phone,

142
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,071
so you must be in your kitchen.

143
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,823
Or one of your bedrooms.

144
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,117
Unless you have a wall jack
in your basement.

145
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,576
That would be huge!

146
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,120
Look outside your window.

147
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,663
I’m not supposed
to look out the window

148
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,831
when I’m alone.

149
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:55,832
Just do it!

150
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,710
Cell phone!

151
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,380
Let’s assign each
other ringtones.

152
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,799
(beeping)

153
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,175
That felt good.

154
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,343
(phone ringing)

155
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,469
Hello.

156
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,304
You want Denis Leary?

157
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,764
Wrong number, dumb-ass.

158
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,350
Come on, Denis. It’s me,
producer Brian Grazer.

159
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,102
I just paid $5 million

160
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,146
for the screen rights
to the book <i>Everybody Poops.</i>

161
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,856
I’m a big fan.

162
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,983
Only one face
came to mind

163
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,068
for the constipated
gorilla: yours.

164
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,778
Sure-- on one condition.

165
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,363
I want to do my own poops.

166
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,073
I wouldn’t have it
any other way.

167
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,200
Of course I’ll do it
for minimum.

168
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,577
Great.

169
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,328
I’ll see you next Monday
in Tunisia.

170
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,372
This phone belongs
to Denis Leary!

171
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,583
Denis Leary?

172
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,545
Boston comedian-turned-movie-
star-turned-basic-cable-notable?

173
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,421
That’s right.

174
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,590
Let’s call his business manager
and tell him to spend

175
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,134
all his money on Yankees hats
and Derek Jeter jerseys.

176
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,011
I don’t know, Bart.

177
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,388
What if Denis Leary gets mad?

178
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,723
Naw, he’s cool.

179
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,558
He’s gonna think
this is hilarious.

180
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,481
No longer must

181
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,649
we live in shame!

182
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,067
Let the decree go forth:

183
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,069
everybody poops!

184
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,613
And... cut!

185
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,573
Great, great, man.

186
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,074
You really nailed it!

187
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,076
I don’t even remember
agreeing to be in this movie.

188
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,369
Well, you did.

189
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,746
Bring in the poop.

190
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,003
Milhouse, I hold in this hand
Denis Leary’s cell phone,

191
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,713
and in this hand,
the phone numbers

192
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,173
of bars around the world.

193
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:30,218
Let’s start with Hawaii.

194
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,094
-(phone ringing)
-Aloha.

195
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,429
Aloha to you.

196
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,848
I’m looking for Maya.
Last name Normousbutt.

197
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,058
Hang on. I’ll check.

198
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,143
Has anyone here seen
Maya Normousbutt?

199
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,771
(laughing)

200
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,611
(phone ringing)

201
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,947
I got a "Drew P. Wiener" here.

202
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,157
Anyone expecting
a Drew P. Wiener?

203
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,826
I hold in my hand
a Drew P. Wiener.

204
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,620
Better put it
down then, mate.

205
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,205
(laughing)

206
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,170
(phone ringing)

207
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,297
<i>Ja?</i>

208
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,966
I shall inquire.

209
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,593
Is there a Mr. Myfriendsaregay?

210
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,054
First name Olaf?

211
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,806
Attention, everyone.

212
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,933
Olaf Myfriendsaregay.

213
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,519
(laughing grimly)

214
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,229
Wait a minute.

215
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,565
If I ever get
a hold of you...

216
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:30,444
I will thank you for showing me
the futility of human endeavor.

217
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,779
(both laughing)

218
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,991
Oh, the sun never sets
on the Bartish Empire.

219
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:35,825
(phone ringing)

220
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,826
Yo. Who’s this?

221
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,452
Denis Leary, you little puke!

222
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,121
I’m gonna rip out your heart
with two fingers!

223
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,039
They taught me how
to do it for my show!

224
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,000
Which one,
the one that got canceled

225
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,293
or the one that’s gonna
get canceled?

226
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,877
You are so dead!

227
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,629
(laughing)

228
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,424
That laughter sounds like
the result of misbehavior.

229
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,884
Bart, how did you
get a cell phone?

230
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:54,885
Same way you got me:

231
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,429
by accident, on a golf course.

232
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,306
Whose phone is this?

233
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,557
You’ll never get it out of me.

234
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,058
Okay. Milhouse?

235
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,436
It’s Denis Leary’s!

236
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,062
I’m sorry, Bart.

237
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,189
I’m desperate for any
signs of adult approval.

238
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,400
You did the right thing.

239
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,484
(sighs)

240
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,111
(phone ringing)

241
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,614
Uh... Bart Simpson’s
stolen cell phone.

242
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,740
Can I help you?

243
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,283
Damn straight you can!

244
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,035
I’m Denis Leary,
and your kid is out of control!

245
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,329
I’m sorry, Mr. Leary.

246
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,873
Sometimes it’s hard
to be a parent.

247
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,750
No it’s not. It’s easy!
I’ll tell you what’s hard:

248
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,793
having to watch my stunt double
run into a burning building,

249
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,587
worrying that people might
realize it’s not me; it’s him.

250
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,631
Try doing that!

251
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,008
I don’t think I could.

252
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,177
Mr. Leary, I’m so sorry.

253
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,220
I’ll send you your phone
back right away.

254
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,222
Keep the phone. In fact,
can I give you some advice?

255
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,516
Of course. You’re Denis Leary!

256
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,143
Give your kid back the phone...

257
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,020
but first, activate
its built-in GPS system.

258
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,813
That way you can log on
to your carrier’s Web site

259
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,315
and track your son’s movements,

260
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,359
the way I track every actor who
gets a movie that I was up for.

261
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,404
Shouldn’t you just be happy
for their success?

262
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,947
I should be a lot
of things, lady.

263
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,950
My Tarts!

264
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,465
(sighs)
Okay, here goes.

265
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,509
Bart, I have
something for you!

266
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,843
Huh?

267
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,555
Wait a minute.

268
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,807
I thought you said
I couldn’t have this.

269
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,433
Well, sweetie...

270
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,268
I know I said you
couldn’t have a cell phone,

271
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,063
but, in these days
of stranger dangers

272
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,606
and sinister ministers,

273
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,108
I think it’s important
that we’re in touch.

274
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,319
Lady, you are the best mom ever!

275
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,615
(groans)

276
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,160
Did he take the bait?

277
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,204
Like a big-mouthed bass.

278
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,914
(laughing mirthlessly)

279
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,167
Okay, Bart went
to the comic book store.

280
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,794
Time to head home.

281
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,087
(gasps)
Bullies!

282
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,133
Hey, he went into
a construction site.

283
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,301
That’s a hard hat zone!

284
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,930
(laughing):
You sure this is safe?

285
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,765
Sure, I got my seat belt on.

286
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,267
MARGE:
Bartholomew J. Simpson!

287
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,686
(gasps)

288
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,230
What are you doing
at this construction site?!

289
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,649
Uh, trying to do something
constructive?

290
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,692
(groans)

291
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,861
I’ll just take
Milhouse home.

292
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,534

(screaming)

300
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,195
Hey, Bart just keeps spinning

301
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,781
around and around and around.

302
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,240
What’s his angle?

303
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,956
What are you two doing
in the laundry room?

304
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,168
Uh...
we’re doing laundry.

305
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,795
Dad, do laundry.

306
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,004
(chuckles nervously)

307
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,297
No problem.

308
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,840
Mm-hmm.

309
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,134
Hmm...

310
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,803
Mm-hmm.

311
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,721
Hmm... Hmm!

312
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,348
(humming tune)

313
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,561
Tracking software?

314
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,021
(gasps)

315
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,649
You’re spying on Bart!

316
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,359
Honey, keeping track
of someone

317
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,110
because you love them
is not wrong.

318
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,111
It shows you care.

319
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,738
(static)

320
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,659
That’s right,
my beautiful, beautiful Midge.

321
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,993
(laughing evilly)

322
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,995
<i>Soon you’ll be mine.</i>

323
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,997
Keep talking, creep-o.

324
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,125
Every word buys you
another year in the slammer.

325
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,592
Bart, there’s something
I need to tell you.

326
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,927
Mom and Dad...

327
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,720
Shh!

328
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,181
I’m listening to financing terms
for double-glazed windows.

329
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,599
-(phone rings)
-Awesome. Another call.

330
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,600
You got Bart.

331
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,018
It’s me, you idiot.

332
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,603
Mom and Dad are
spying on you.

333
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,106
There’s a tracking chip
in your cell phone.

334
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,024
(gasps)
They’re spying on me?

335
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,359
That’s horrible!

336
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,736
I know! It’s a complete
violation of your rights.

337
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,988
Not to mention...

338
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,406
Hold that thought.
I’m getting a text.

339
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,367
Viagra at five dollars a pill?

340
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,161
Whatever it is,
it’s goin’ in Skinner’s coffee.

341
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,540
What is in this coffee?!

342
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,423
(twittering)

343
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,591
Mm-hmm.

344
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,305
Track <i>this,</i>
Mom and Dad.

345
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,472
(chuckling)

346
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,351
MARGE:
Look at Bart go!

347
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,228
(gasps)
He must be running away!

348
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,022
Eh, he won’t get far.

349
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,316
Not on the crappy breakfast
<i>I </i>made for him.

350
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,942
Oh, my God,
he’s out of frame!

351
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,527
Zoom out! Zoom out!

352
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,947
What...?

353
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,534
Hmm. He’s circling the
Shelbyville Bird Sanctuary.

354
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:14,079
(laughs)
Our little boy
has lost his mind.

355
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,205
Let’s get him.

356
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,004
(chuckles)

357
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,590
Looks like I’ve got the house
to myself for a while.

358
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,425
I can do anything I want!

359
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,552
First, I’m gonna take a bath.

360
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,554
Then I’m gonna eat
some vegetables

361
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,891
and <i>then </i>I’m gonna get
to bed nice and early,

362
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,476
with no TV.

363
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,604
(laughing)

364
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,486
So your family’s been gone
for three days?

365
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,696
Yeah. And I think they
may be gone a while longer.

366
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,782
Ooh, it looks like the
grilled Twizzlers are ready.

367
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,786
Mmm. Oh, yeah.

368
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,287
This baby is <i>done.</i>

369
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:01,543
(grunting)

370
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,379
Mmm. Awesome.

371
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,630
But I better get goin’.

372
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,965
It’s gettin’ dark.

373
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,091
My mom’s gonna wake up soon.

374
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:10,636
She gets upset
if someone’s not there
to tell her where she is.

375
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,637
(laughs)

376
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,305
Typical mom.

377
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,432
You sure you don’t wanna stay
and have a sleepover?

378
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,600
I made sleepover shirts.

379
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,977
Huh? Huh?

380
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,187
Listen Bart,
if I don’t get home soon,

381
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,522
there won’t be time for my mom

382
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,108
to give me a hug,
my dad to read me a story,

383
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,193
and both of them
to sing me a song

384
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:29,029
until I <i>gently </i>fall asleep.

385
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,448
Anyway, you have fun
by yourself.

386
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,200
Huh, there’s
no moon tonight.

387
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,619
Real boogeyman
weather.

388
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,329
(wind blows)

389
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,039
(shuddering)

390
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,048
Bart’s been moving nonstop
all afternoon.

391
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,802
Maybe there’s too much sugar
in his Sugar-Frosted Candy O’s.

392
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,054
Something about this
just doesn’t seem right.

393
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,973
Pull over.
Bart’s in this field.

394
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,977
Bart!

395
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,229
Where are you, boy?!

396
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,232
Don’t worry.
I won’t strangle you.

397
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,448
(twittering)

398
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,159
(Lisa gasps)

399
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,119
I think we’re
following <i>you.</i>

400
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,620
What’s your species,
little guy?

401
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,083
Oh, you’re a
scarlet tanager.

402
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,294
You’ve been flying south
because you’re migrating to...

403
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,713
Machu Picchu, Peru!

404
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,674
Well, I could tell Mom and Dad
the chip is in the bird

405
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:34,011
and hope they take me to
Machu Picchu another time, or...

406
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,429
Shoo. Shoo.

407
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,847
Mom! Dad!

408
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,057
Bart’s on the move!

409
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,310
(owl hooting)

410
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,686
Oh, man.

411
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,856
When you’re alone,
night is scary.

412
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,982
Day is awesome!

413
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:47,941
(television static)

414
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,777
Night is scary.

415
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,404
Day is awesome!

416
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,408
Night is scary...

417
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,498
Are we <i>ever </i>going to find him?

418
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,916
Absolutely.

419
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,335
That unpleasantness
in Ecuador is behind us.

420
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,921
My coca leaf addiction
is under control,

421
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:13,717
and Bart is finally trapped in
that paradise above the clouds.

422
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,972
Bart!

423
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,974
Where <i>are </i>you, Bart?

424
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,559
Is that him?

425
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,063
No, it’s just a bush.

426
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:30,025
Clearly the work of Wirakocha,
the trickster god.

427
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,653
You guys look
exhausted.

428
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,446
Maybe you ought to rest
for a while.

429
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,533
No! All I care about
is finding my boy,

430
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,202
and then I’m never letting him
out of my sight again.

431
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,872
(snoring)

432
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,548
Greetings,
sky-haired sun mother.

433
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,342
Um... I don’t need
any new friends.

434
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,344
I’m just looking
for my little boy.

435
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,388
I need to protect him
from himself.

436
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,182
Like the mothers
of ancient Machu Picchu

437
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,851
protected <i>their </i>children?

438
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,602
(thunder rumbling)

439
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,021
(Marge yells)

440
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,357
Hmm. Hmm.

441
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,987
<i>STATUE:</i>
<i>Our mothers were</i>
<i>the most overprotective</i>

442
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,947
<i>in the greater Machu Picchu</i>
<i>metropolitan area.</i>

443
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,240
<i>They forced their children</i>

444
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,367
<i>to live in this</i>
<i>walled mountain city.</i>

445
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,828
Those walls do look safe.

446
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:26,248
Walls that keep out danger
keep out knowledge.

447
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,333
Our young people never learned
to survive on their own,

448
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,585
so when they grew up,

449
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,044
they were no match

450
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,296
for the conquistadors.

451
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,465
(Three Stooges-like yelling)

452
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,550
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoop-whoop.

453
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,759
Whoop, whoop, whoop,
whoop, whoop, whoop...

454
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,637
(Three Stooges-like yelling)

455
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,889
Oh, my God.

456
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,057
You’ve taught me
a valuable lesson.

457
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,559
I didn’t mean to.
I’m just chatty.

458
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,477
I sold my business
a few years ago

459
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,395
and I miss talking
to people.

460
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,444
So I can’t always
be there for Bart.

461
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,571
He’s got to learn
to take care of himself.

462
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,073
The computer says Bart’s
standing on the computer,

463
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,617
but all I see is a stupid bird

464
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,243
with a tracking chip
on its leg.

465
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,369
It doesn’t add up.

466
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,915
(chirps)

467
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,417
I think it’s time
for us to go home.

468
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:14,713
(slurping)

469
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:15,756
Hey.

470
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,091
Thank God you’re okay!

471
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,176
Were you guys gone?

472
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,720
We were gone for two weeks.

473
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,388
I didn’t even notice.

474
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,556
(sighs)

475
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,809
I just made
a 3,700-mile car trip.

476
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,977
I need to wash up.

477
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,064
Oh!

478
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,982
Never leave again.

479
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,776
Aww...

480
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,571
(grunting with effort)

481
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,572
Where’s Maggie?

482
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,407
Oh, uh, she’s, uh...

483
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,617
