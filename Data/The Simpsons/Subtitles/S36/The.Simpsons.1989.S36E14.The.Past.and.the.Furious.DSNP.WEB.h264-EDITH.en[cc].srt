00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,953
Yes, that's right. It's me,
Mr. Burns from the future.

338
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,705
How did you get here?

339
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,917
I used your buzzers to zap my
old self into my young brain box.

340
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,627
Now, hear this, young me.

341
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,589
The life of a selfish
tycoon is beyond compare.

342
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:11,632
How so?

343
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:15,761
Through exploitation, war profiteering,
and owning the Las Vegas Raiders,

344
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,888
you will amass billions!

345
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:21,851
That does sound
possibly excellent.

346
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:26,522
Yes. You'll have a Picasso in every
bathroom, an army of loyal hounds,

347
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,441
and command your own Smithers.

348
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:33,029
Wealth, power, whatever a Smithers
is. It's all hard to resist.

349
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,491
But still, I feel a profound
darkness in my future self.

350
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,036
Maybe I should
find another path.

351
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:46,000
Yes! All you have to do is believe
that one person can make a difference.

352
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,251
Dang it!

353
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:51,172
Dad! I was just about to
save Mr. Burns's soul,

354
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,550
and change the course
of this town's history.

355
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,846
[groans]

356
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,097
Hmm?

357
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,853
I win. I convinced young
me to become old me.

358
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,731
And warned him not to
marry Roseanne Barr.

359
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,027
He's got a little more spring
in his step. That's something.

360
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,111
[grunts]

361
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,322
Uh, don't forget
your dream journal.

362
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,449
Oh, just throw it in the core.

363
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,079
Mr. Gumble, are you okay?

364
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,873
I left a wake-up call for 8:15.

365
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:32,046
"Edith, I left you something in the
basement of the joint where we first met."

366
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:36,217
A message from Monty B? I
gotta get into Moe's basement.

367
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,886
Moe, please do a favor for
a young girl hesitating

368
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,138
to feel even a shred
of hope, for fear of...

369
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,474
I don't care about your
internal struggle, okay?

370
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,558
Down you go.

371
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,362
[Monty B] My friend.
I've made my choice.

372
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,408
But I had one last bit of good in my
heart, so I had to purge myself of it!

373
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,452
I've left you a couple
remaining orchid seeds

374
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,287
and funding for
a beautiful park,

375
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,666
once you sell the priceless
Tiffany lamp I've enclosed.

376
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,044
- [broken glass clattering]
- Oh…

377
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:17,258
It should be safe, packed in
worthless tobacco baseball cards.

378
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,470
[Lisa gasps]

379
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,973
These are worth a fortune.

380
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,725
Thank you, Monty B.

381
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:34,859
Sweetie, I'm still very troubled by
all the crazy things you claim you did,

382
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,070
but you seem happy
right now, so all good.

383
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,030
It's a great garden.

384
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:44,827
Thanks, Mom. It turns out one
little girl can make a difference…

385
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,455
[mutters softly] As long as
she travels through time.

386
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,373
What a waste of time,
space and money.

387
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:53,002
I'd release the hounds on you if
this park allowed dogs off leash.

388
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,421
[dogs growling]

389
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,178

lovely as ever, Mother.
