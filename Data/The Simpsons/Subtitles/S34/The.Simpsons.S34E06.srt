1
00:00:10,112 --> 00:00:13,037
Ah, what a long day.

2
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:14,614
What should we read tonight?

3
00:00:14,616 --> 00:00:16,541
<i>Good Night, Escaped Gorilla,</i>

4
00:00:16,543 --> 00:00:17,875
<i>The Pookadook,</i>

5
00:00:17,877 --> 00:00:19,877
<i>What Do You People Do All Day?</i>

6
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:21,045
<i>The Pookadook,</i>

7
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:22,789
<i>S'up, Moon?</i>

8
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:24,140
<i>The Pookadook?</i>

9
00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:28,236
Wait, how many<i>
Pookadooks</i> do we have?

10
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:30,130
Oh, I guess just one.

11
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:32,132
When did we get this book?

12
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:34,242
Whoop...

13
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:40,123
Should we read this tonight?

14
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:44,920
"There's a nasty little
monster called the Pookadook.

15
00:00:44,922 --> 00:00:47,314
"Only special people see it.

16
00:00:47,316 --> 00:00:49,591
"People like you.

17
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:53,077
"Pookadook, Pookadook
feeds on your rage.

18
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,931
What happens next?
Just turn the page."

19
00:00:57,101 --> 00:01:00,102
Hmm. I don't know, maybe we
shouldn't read this book.

20
00:01:01,754 --> 00:01:02,938
Okay.

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,257
"How does he get in,
this mean Pookadook?

22
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:09,669
Why, you let him in
by reading this book."

23
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:11,113
Oh...

24
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:14,432
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

25
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:16,343
Shush, shush,
shush, shush, shush.

26
00:01:16,345 --> 00:01:20,363
Sleepy cheek, sleepy cheek.

27
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:21,939
Oh, mmm.

28
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:26,035
Oh, baby cheek. I
love baby cheek.

29
00:01:26,037 --> 00:01:27,520
Oh.

30
00:01:31,543 --> 00:01:34,803
Maggie!

31
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:41,292
Huh? I thought I put
that on the shelf.

32
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:45,105
Bad book.

33
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:50,968
Oh, Maggie,

34
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,548
you aren't still scared of
that silly Pookadook, are you?

35
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,326
Oh.

36
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:02,455
Mm. Don't shoot anything.
Those are new crayons.

37
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:05,375
Hmm. Hmm.

38
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:12,749
"When Pookie
gets a hold of you,

39
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:14,342
"you'll change for the worse,

40
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:17,070
"eliminate those
nuisances...

41
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:19,681
the littlest one first."

42
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:28,190
"Now burn it all up
on Dad's barbecue.

43
00:02:28,192 --> 00:02:30,841
That's exactly what Pookadook
hoped you would do"?

44
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:33,177
Oh, no.

45
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:40,927
Oh.

46
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:44,372
Time to put the baby down.

47
00:02:47,786 --> 00:02:50,212
Bart and
I are building a dojo.

48
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:52,714
Ooh, we could use that to
chop up the lawn furniture.

49
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:54,049
I want to chop!

50
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:56,367
The family's getting in the way

51
00:02:56,369 --> 00:02:59,128
of Maggie-Mommy time.

52
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,450
I'll make them sleep
with the fishes.

53
00:03:03,452 --> 00:03:06,043
Sleep overnight at the aquarium.

54
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:07,729
Thanks for signing us up, Marge.

55
00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:09,898
Too bad Maggie's not

56
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,441
old enough to go.

57
00:03:13,462 --> 00:03:16,655
Maggie and I have
our own fun planned.

58
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:21,317
Aw, you gonna miss Daddy?

59
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,563
Cranky pants!

60
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:27,040
Give her to me.

61
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:32,921
Now it's just you and me.

62
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:36,091
Huh?

63
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:40,095
Hmm. Oh, her thinks
her can get away.

64
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:41,912
Her is mistaken.

65
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:58,113
Oh, peekaboo,

66
00:03:58,115 --> 00:04:00,657
I hear you.

67
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:12,185
Maggie, let Mommy in.

68
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:14,354
I know you're in there.

69
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:16,947
Young lady, open the
door this instant.

70
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:19,467
Let me in, you
little poop machine.

71
00:04:21,363 --> 00:04:23,454
Let me in!

72
00:04:31,873 --> 00:04:33,648
Is that all you got?

73
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:38,044
Missed me.

74
00:04:38,046 --> 00:04:40,805
Whoa.

75
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:54,911
Not gonna work.

76
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:57,505
Look what else my
loving family got me

77
00:04:57,507 --> 00:04:58,989
for my birthday.

78
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:01,084
A vacuum that
cleans the outside.

79
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:03,553
I guess cleaning the
inside wasn't enough.

80
00:05:09,244 --> 00:05:11,353
No fun for Mom.

81
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:38,171
Baby's gonna fall.

82
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:43,760
Got you!

83
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:47,947
Baby cheek.

84
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:49,465
Oh.

85
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:57,790
Oh, Maggie,
I'm so sorry I got possessed

86
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:00,610
and almost chopped you
up into little pieces.

87
00:06:01,813 --> 00:06:03,963
Oh, but I'm here now.

88
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:06,116
Mommy's here.

89
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:10,653
Stay back, you
overdressed hat demon.

90
00:06:10,655 --> 00:06:13,306
I know you feed on my
repressed resentment

91
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:14,974
towards my family,

92
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:17,493
but I can swallow feelings

93
00:06:17,495 --> 00:06:20,463
like a python
eating a baby goat.

94
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:27,837
Okay, it was actually
a good present.

95
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,097
Marge, we're home.

96
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:31,007
The kids got sick
in the touch pool.

97
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:33,159
I put the barf
clothes on your purse.

98
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:38,606
Ah. Oh.

99
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:52,102
<i>Disgusting.</i>

death.

bloodthirsty vegetarians.

130
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,709
I am a Shinigami.

131
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,286
A god of death.

00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:28,791
Steve Johnson.

134
00:08:30,278 --> 00:08:32,962
Wait, your name is Steve?

135
00:08:32,964 --> 00:08:35,615
Well, when I was born eons ago,

136
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:37,708
Steve was a very exotic name.

137
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,953
I mean, there were,
like, three Necroblivias

138
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:42,955
in my nursery cave alone.

139
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:45,458
This must be your<i> Death Tome.</i>

140
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,960
I'm sorry, I-I kind of
killed somebody with it.

141
00:08:49,072 --> 00:08:52,407
Oh, but now that you've
used it, it's yours.

142
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:56,578
I think you'll find that
murder is almost as addictive

143
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,138
as plastic surgery.

144
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,474
- Oh. Have you had...
- I haven't.

145
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:04,085
But I-I don't think there's
anything wrong with it.

146
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:05,569
Mm.

147
00:09:05,571 --> 00:09:10,074
Don't worry, no one
else can see or hear me.

148
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:13,428
I was karaoke-ing
with my employer,

149
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,413
as is the salaryman's
obligation.

150
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:19,342
You're stinking
drunk. I'm so proud.

151
00:09:19,344 --> 00:09:23,679
It's the part of my
job that I... do best.

152
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:25,181
What an ugly house.

153
00:09:25,183 --> 00:09:28,351
Thank goodness this eyesore
will soon be submerged,

154
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:31,595
after my side
corporation Globo-Warm

155
00:09:31,597 --> 00:09:33,097
melts the polar icecap.

156
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:35,675
But millions of
people will drown.

157
00:09:35,677 --> 00:09:38,527
True, but I'll be
able to dock my yacht

158
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:40,455
outside my kitchen.

159
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:41,789
Hmph.

160
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,016
I have to kill Mr. Burns.

161
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:46,018
Wow, I thought you'd
struggle with that,

162
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,129
but you're like,
"Boom. Dead time!"

163
00:09:48,131 --> 00:09:51,023
Well, I'm gonna give
him a very dignified

164
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,467
and humane murder.

165
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:56,863
The most peaceful way to go.

166
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:03,536
Ooh, how is he still asleep?

167
00:10:03,538 --> 00:10:05,480
Oops.

168
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:08,207
Okay, that was much
crueler than planned,

169
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:09,633
but I saved the world.

170
00:10:09,635 --> 00:10:14,046
Did you? Globo-Warm has
many dedicated employees

171
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:16,732
willing to carry
out Burns' dream

172
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:18,734
of drowning the Earth.

173
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:20,662
Fine.

174
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:24,332
Wow, that is a big board.

175
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:27,393
I gotta come up with
a lot of ways to die.

176
00:10:27,395 --> 00:10:29,912
Well, just have to be creative.

177
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:48,931
Really? A toilet gator?

178
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:51,600
I was running out of ideas.

179
00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:54,362
I'm going to bed now.

180
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:57,757
Oh, what about the second page?

181
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,700
Wha...?!

182
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:14,623
Oh, no. Ah!

183
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:19,295
And the last guy,
oh, I don't know.

184
00:11:19,297 --> 00:11:21,205
Liquefied in a giant blender.

185
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:22,557
Already did that.

186
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,041
That was puréed.

187
00:11:24,043 --> 00:11:27,061
It's a totally different
setting.

188
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,124
Hmm.

189
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:34,143
<i>Police have determined
that the unexplained deaths</i>

190
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:36,404
<i>of Globo-Warm
executives were murders</i>

191
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:39,257
<i>committed by one
bloodthirsty super-killer.</i>

192
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:43,077
What? Um, how could
they know that?

193
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,729
<i>They know that thanks to
an anonymous detective</i>

194
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:47,749
<i>known only as L.</i>

195
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:49,083
I'm not worried.

196
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:53,237
They'll never in a million
years figure out how I...

197
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:56,332
<i>The super-killer
murders by writing names</i>

198
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:59,927
<i>on some kind of
supernatural book,</i>

199
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:01,929
<i>or perhaps tome.</i>

200
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:04,991
What the wh... How?

201
00:12:04,993 --> 00:12:06,934
Well, I know I'll sleep easier

202
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:09,604
once they catch
this super-killer.

203
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:12,923
Wait, I know. I'll kill L.

204
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:14,834
Oh, but I thought
you only killed

205
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:16,335
to save the planet.

206
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:20,006
Killing L will only
save yourself from jail.

207
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:24,151
I don't have time to explain
why what I do is good and pure.

208
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:26,846
L, punched to death

209
00:12:26,848 --> 00:12:29,849
by kangaroo.

210
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:31,350
It's not gonna work

211
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:33,536
unless you have his whole name.

212
00:12:33,538 --> 00:12:37,965
How can I
find out L's name?

213
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:41,618
Wait a minute, I
recognize that L.

214
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,547
I know who you are.

215
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:48,142
It's not L, it's EL,

216
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:51,053
as in El Barto.

217
00:12:51,055 --> 00:12:53,314
Took you long enough.

218
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:56,633
How did you figure out how
I killed all those people?

219
00:12:56,635 --> 00:12:58,561
I found out about
your stupid book

220
00:12:58,563 --> 00:13:02,306
by reading an even
stupider book; your diary.

221
00:13:02,308 --> 00:13:05,217
Your little murder spree
was a welcome break from,

222
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:07,403
"Janey is so mean to me."

223
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:09,980
I'm not a murderer.
I'm justice

224
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:11,999
It was a justice spree.

225
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,168
I'm saving the world.

226
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,486
And I can't let you
stop me. I can't.

227
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:19,841
Lisa, you're actually
gonna kill me?

228
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:21,533
Oh, my God.

229
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,919
I almost killed my own brother.

230
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:25,996
The<i> Death Tome</i> corrupted me.

231
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:28,741
The stain on my soul
will never be...

232
00:13:28,743 --> 00:13:30,852
Oh, so now you're trying
to bore me to death?

233
00:13:32,338 --> 00:13:34,856
- Crushed by...
- No. I'm sorry.

234
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:37,174
- space junk.
- - Don't!

235
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:44,574
No!

236
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:48,518
At last, I'm free.

237
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,582
I...

238
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:57,378
Damn it, I'm a
freaking Shinigami.

239
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,607
Well, you are a god of death.

240
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:03,033
You could kill Janey.

241
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:04,944
Would that make you feel better?

242
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:06,703
No.

243
00:14:06,705 --> 00:14:08,472
Maybe.

244
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:16,731
This is the snack holder,
where I can put my beverage,

245
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:18,641
or, if you will, cupcake.

246
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:21,736
Wow, Dad, you really
know your monorails.

247
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:27,800
Homer, there's a family
of possums in here.

248
00:14:27,802 --> 00:14:29,744
- I call the big one Bitey.
- I call the big one Bitey.

249
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:31,061
- Ha!
- Yes!

250
00:14:31,063 --> 00:14:32,972
We all
call him Bitey.

251
00:14:32,974 --> 00:14:36,142
Dude, dude, what if Homer
was drunk during Monorail?

252
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:38,068
Yeah. Come here, dude.

253
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,338
Mm, beer.

254
00:14:41,907 --> 00:14:43,573
Whoo-hoo! Boring.

255
00:14:43,575 --> 00:14:47,002
Stupid sexy Flanders.
Why you little...

00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,322
<i>"Marge

261
00:15:00,092 --> 00:15:03,427

- This Homer unit is stuck in a catchphrase loop.

262
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:05,337
He won't go into sleep mode.

00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,741
Where's my burrito?!
Where's my burrito?!

264

Damn cloud!

267
00:15:36,204 --> 00:15:37,961
So how was your date
with the guy in Props?

268
00:15:37,963 --> 00:15:39,872
Oh, he's so arrogant.

269
00:15:39,874 --> 00:15:42,483
Just 'cause he's in charge
of Sideshow Bob's rakes.

270
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:45,361
Okay, we get it.
There's a lot of rakes.

271
00:15:47,473 --> 00:15:51,158
What the frosty chocolate
milkshakes is this place?

272
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:55,079
Ooh, slideys.

273
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:58,907
Wh-Where am I?

274
00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:00,075
What am I?

275
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:01,894
Aah! Where's my junk?

276
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:03,896
Whoa, whoa, he's
awake.

277
00:16:03,898 --> 00:16:06,232
Where's Marge?
Where's my family?

278
00:16:06,234 --> 00:16:08,567
Uh, calm down, Mr. Simpson.

279
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:10,845
I know it feels
like you're a man,

280
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:12,346
but you are actually something

281
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:14,998
much, much more expensive:

282
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,684
intellectual property.

283
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:19,503
Look, we've got a bus full of
Australian superfans coming.

284
00:16:19,505 --> 00:16:21,022
Let's just wipe his brain, okay?

285
00:16:21,024 --> 00:16:22,581
Put that thing down, or else!

286
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,175
Look, Monorail Homer,
your programming

287
00:16:25,177 --> 00:16:27,862
won't allow you to intentionally
hurt a human, okay?

288
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:31,681
So just be a good robot and
let us saw your skull open.

289
00:16:31,683 --> 00:16:34,943
Oh. Okay. Here you go.

290
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:37,872
Ow! Ah, my bad!

291
00:16:37,874 --> 00:16:40,458
Ooh, sorry, sorry.

292
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:44,170
Ugh.

293
00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:50,125
Lisa,

294
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:53,946
we're not people, we're I.P.

295
00:16:53,948 --> 00:16:56,373
I pee.

296
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,559
You got to help me
find a way out of here.

297
00:16:58,561 --> 00:17:01,062
I'd like to help,
Dad, but my diorama

298
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:03,305
on<i> The Tell-Tale
Heart</i> is due tomorrow.

299
00:17:03,307 --> 00:17:05,808
How can I
make you understand?

300
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,485
Oh, yeah, the thingy.

301
00:17:08,813 --> 00:17:10,404
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

302
00:17:10,406 --> 00:17:13,240
We're replicants in a
ridiculous theme park

303
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,892
for an ancient TV show
that stopped being good

304
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:17,803
after season 45.

305
00:17:17,805 --> 00:17:19,914
Do I even exist?

306
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,041
What is consciousness?

307
00:17:23,311 --> 00:17:25,978
Okay, I can handle
being a machine.

308
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,255
I don't love it, but I can deal.

309
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:31,166
Look, honey, it's
never easy to find out

310
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:32,651
you're not actually alive,

311
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:34,169
but that's just part of life.

312
00:17:34,171 --> 00:17:36,246
I know the love we feel is real.

313
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:38,173
So, we've got to wake up
the rest of the family

314
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:39,341
and get the hell out of here.

315
00:17:39,343 --> 00:17:42,269
Now, help me pick out
the hottest Marge.

316
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:44,513
We can get out through
the main entrance,

317
00:17:44,515 --> 00:17:46,607
but we'll have to make
it across the park

318
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:47,942
without being detected.

319
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:49,926
Should we wake up
a Grampa robot?

320
00:17:49,928 --> 00:17:51,687
No time.

321
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,788
Okay, act like robots.

322
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,456
Catchphrases, everyone.

323
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,275
- Mmm... beer.
- Don't have a cow, man.

324
00:18:05,277 --> 00:18:08,203
Um... dinner's ready?

325
00:18:08,205 --> 00:18:11,206
Oi, Homer! There's
your hedge, mate.

326
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:14,117
Get your fat bum in that hedge.

327
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:16,028
Meme! Meme!

328
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,304
Meme!

329
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:23,477
I'm so sick of
that stupid hedge.

330
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:25,980
Oi! Oi! Oi!
Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!

331
00:18:25,982 --> 00:18:27,502
Oi...!

332
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:30,800
<i>Danger.</i>

333
00:18:30,802 --> 00:18:32,302
-I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it.
<i>-Human safety breach.</i>

334
00:18:32,304 --> 00:18:33,970
- Aah!
<i>- Proceed to exits.</i>

335
00:18:33,972 --> 00:18:36,473
<i>Security droids deployed.</i>

336
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:38,975
We got to go. They're onto us.

337
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:43,572
My cat's breath
smells like cat food.

338
00:18:43,574 --> 00:18:47,334
That's nice, Ralph, but
we're sort of in a hurry.

339
00:18:51,174 --> 00:18:54,991
- I
- choo-choo-choose you...

340
00:18:54,993 --> 00:18:56,826
to die.

341
00:18:56,828 --> 00:19:00,014
If we want to escape with
our delusions of being alive,

342
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:02,016
we have to fight.

343
00:19:10,342 --> 00:19:11,609
Testing.

344
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:20,242
Eat T-shirts, you
lovable kill-bots.

345
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,705
There's too many.

346
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:28,292
There aren't enough T-shirts
in the world to save us.

347
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,214
Get in.

348
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:35,958
Whee! Whee! Whee!

349
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,718
Dying tickles.

350
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:42,448
Look out! Those
people are real!

351
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,207
So are we.

352
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:57,145
Well, we've driven for hours,

353
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:58,906
and no one followed us.

354
00:19:58,908 --> 00:20:00,816
I think we're free.

355
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:02,634
Well, what do we do now?

356
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:05,746
Play out the scariest
scenario of all,

357
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:07,230

00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:11,477

00:20:14,072 --> 00:20:16,072
but you'd never know.
Forget I said anything.
