00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:18,596
Mmm, gravy.

00:00:25,294 --> 00:00:28,105
Sorry, dear, I burnt the roast.

3
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:30,814
Again?

4
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:34,392
Relax, Judy. Let Duffman help.

5
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:38,320
Ah. Forgiven.

6
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:41,082
- Thank you, Duffman.
- You're welcome, Judy.

7
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,896
Hey, you can do
at least one thing right.

Those were the days, huh?

21
00:01:27,706 --> 00:01:29,683
Well, those days may have been
the days back then,

22
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:32,450
but these days, the days
aren't those days anymore.

23
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:35,021
And, gentlemen,
we can't be either.

24
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:37,546
Go ahead and harrumph,

25
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,049
but Duff needs a new message
and a new messenger,

26
00:01:40,144 --> 00:01:41,528
so get a harrumph of this.

27
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:43,887
<i>Attention, Duff Nation.</i>

28
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,980
<i>We need you to choose
our new mascot</i>

29
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:47,632
<i>by voting in our first ever</i>

30
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:48,557
<i>Duff Election.</i>

31
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:49,799
<i>The candidates are:</i>

32
00:01:49,878 --> 00:01:52,132
<i>Hops and Barley,
lady brewologists</i>

33
00:01:52,156 --> 00:01:53,858
<i>who don't even know
they're pretty.</i>

34
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:57,158
<i>Woketopus, the most open-minded
mollusk on the block.</i>

35
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:58,826
<i>Dame Helen Mirren.</i>

36
00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:00,569
I'm sorry, what is this for?

37
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:02,790
<i>And I guess
we're open to keeping Duffman.</i>

38
00:02:02,814 --> 00:02:05,575
<i>Vote today. Democracy needs you,</i>

39
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:07,168
<i>and so do we.</i>

40
00:02:07,396 --> 00:02:10,747
This is our moment.
Duffman needs us, and so do we.

41
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:12,231
They can't get rid of Duffman.

42
00:02:12,324 --> 00:02:14,395
What's next, tear down
the Oregon Trail?

43
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:16,299
Disintegrate
the Lincoln Memorial?

44
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:17,920
Impeach Santy Claus?

45
00:02:18,073 --> 00:02:20,112
I got a notebook
full of examples here.

46
00:02:20,165 --> 00:02:22,016
You said it. Duffman was there

47
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:24,168
when I had my first beer at 13,

48
00:02:24,246 --> 00:02:25,670
and I want him to be there

49
00:02:25,837 --> 00:02:28,764
when I have my last beer at 54.

50
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:32,175
Why is there a Duffman sticker
on my saxophone case?

51
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,437
My music teacher thinks
I have a problem.

52
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:37,348
We all have a problem.
Duffman might lose.

53
00:02:37,442 --> 00:02:39,776
Everyone, everyone.
The latest numbers are in.

54
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:43,015
Aw, man, he's tied for
last place with some loser named

55
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,039
"No Mascot; Just Logo."

56
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:46,707
Oh, no.

57
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:49,953
Brandon, you're my agent.
Reassure Duffman.

58
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:52,622
D-Man, chill.
You got this in the bag.

59
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:53,864
Hold on one second.

60
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,460
Woketopus, my cephalopod
from another mom bod.

61
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,012
You're gonna mop the floor with
that hip-thrusting has-been.

62
00:03:00,038 --> 00:03:01,463
Still me, Brandon.

63
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:02,890
You have a great day.

64
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,062
Duffman needs to remind people
why they love Duffman.

65
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:09,063
They love him.

66
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:11,274
♪ <i>Doo, bow, bow...</i> ♪

67
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:14,788
Dry T-shirts?

68
00:03:14,812 --> 00:03:17,239
Not on my watch, ladies.

69
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,742
Get out of here!

70
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,987
That was a blatant act
of tortious negligence.

71
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,063
Tortious negligee.

72
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:28,824
Oh, yeah. Ooh!

73
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:43,150
Hey, hey!

74
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:51,021
What is happening?

75
00:03:55,762 --> 00:03:58,665
Not mine. Not mine. Mine...

76
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:00,282
No, not mine. Oh!

77
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:02,783
I do think that this is me.

78
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:07,122
Hey, Duffman. Rough week, brah.

79
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,175
Getting your can crushed
in the polls,

80
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,034
and now you're getting sued
by 37 lady lawyers.

81
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:14,704
Duffman never meant
to hurt or demean

82
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:16,276
any dames, broads, or chicks.

83
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,042
Two thrusts for gender equality.

84
00:04:19,194 --> 00:04:21,274
- He's not sorry.
- He thinks we're idiots.

85
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:22,949
Let's denounce him
at the Gal Dive.

86
00:04:22,973 --> 00:04:24,175
No, no, please, please.

87
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,882
I can't be sexist because,
because...

88
00:04:27,035 --> 00:04:29,978
I'm... the father of a daughter.

89
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:32,314
And as the father of a daughter,

90
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,298
I could never, ever
disrespect women.

91
00:04:35,393 --> 00:04:36,393
Uh-uh.

92
00:04:36,545 --> 00:04:39,321
It seems like every famous man

93
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:40,896
who gets himself in doo-doo

94
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,617
brings up that
he has a daughter,

95
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:45,308
and I think
that's doo-doo. I do.

96
00:04:45,403 --> 00:04:47,495
Father of a daughter.

97
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:49,550
That's the lamest defense
in the world,

98
00:04:49,574 --> 00:04:53,000
but these days there's no way
anybody's gonna fall for it.

99
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:54,651
<i>He's got a daughter?</i>

100
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:57,245
<i>- How bad can he be?
- What a role model.</i>

101
00:04:57,341 --> 00:04:58,391
- What?
- Oh.

102
00:04:58,415 --> 00:05:00,841
Got a photo
of your little princess?

103
00:05:00,992 --> 00:05:04,086
Sure, sure,
I have a picture of her...

104
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:06,514
right here.

105
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:08,240
Wait, that's me.

106
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:10,053
Lisa is Duffman's daughter?

107
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:12,502
Marge, did you sleep
with Duffman?

108
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:14,240
- No.
- Why not?

109
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:15,689
He's lying.

110
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:18,579
That photo must be from one
of those sleazy beer events

111
00:05:18,603 --> 00:05:21,086
you take the kids to,
even though you say you don't.

112
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,416
Duffman's using me as a prop?

113
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,201
You wish. His prop
is a Duff chick magnet.

114
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:29,014
There's got to be
some explanation.

115
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,615
The explanation is he's a jerk,
and I hope he loses.

116
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:36,096
Lisa, you wash
your mouth out with beer.

117
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,858
I hope he loses, too.
Beer, please.

118
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:41,790
Homer, you have to tell Duffman
that he's not allowed to use

119
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:45,105
our daughter as a "get out
of hot water free" card.

120
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:46,778
Oh, can't I just talk to him

121
00:05:46,872 --> 00:05:49,391
at the next "Duff
Single Mom Twerk Olympics"?

122
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:50,725
Now.

123
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:53,435
I hope this is the right place.

124
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:58,641
Um, hi. My name
is Homer Simpson.

125
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:00,571
Duffman is off the clock

126
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:02,629
and does not have time
for randos.

127
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:04,384
Thanks a lot. Drink Duff.

128
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:06,886
Hey, are you gonna slam the door

129
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,059
on your own daughter?

130
00:06:09,153 --> 00:06:12,730
Oh, Duffman is busted. Oh, boy.

131
00:06:12,865 --> 00:06:15,302
You're a sexist and a phony.

132
00:06:15,326 --> 00:06:17,418
How can you live with yourself?

133
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:20,146
All right, all right,
I'm sorry I fibbed.

134
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:21,997
I panicked. I pulled up a pic

135
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:24,978
from Dufftoberfest
from a few years ago.

136
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:27,595
A few years ago
was the best one.

137
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:29,079
What? Oh.

138
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,841
Lisa's not your Lisa.
She's my Lisa,

139
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,319
so the next time
you're in trouble,

140
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:35,920
use a picture
of some other guy's kid.

141
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:37,271
Thanks, Dad.

142
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:43,235
Sorry, I just...

143
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:47,189
Oh, no.

144
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:49,432
Are you okay, Mr. Duffman?

145
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:52,435
I am not.

146
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:54,956
The thing is, I really do have
a daughter, okay?

147
00:06:55,106 --> 00:06:56,918
Her name is Amber.
She's named after

148
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:58,293
my favorite beverage color,

149
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:00,778
but now she's 30 years old,
and she won't talk to me.

150
00:07:02,357 --> 00:07:04,276
Lisa, do you mind waiting
in the car for a moment?

151
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,447
Daddy needs to be strong
for his famous friend.

152
00:07:07,471 --> 00:07:09,178
Of course.

153
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:13,009
Can I get a selfie of me
with you in your bathrobe?

154
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,697
Gah, your daughter is so bright
and confident.

155
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:17,956
She is.

156
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,701
So, you must've taught her
so much.

157
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:22,391
I guess I did.

158
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:25,728
You must be the greatest
girl dad i-in the world.

159
00:07:25,805 --> 00:07:27,374
I must be!

160
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:29,209
Maybe it's not too late
for me, huh?

161
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:31,211
Could you teach me
how to be a better...

162
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:32,879
you know, girl dad?

163
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:36,555
- I will!
- Duffman thanks you.

164
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:38,649
And so do I. Come here.

165
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:53,680
Come on, Duffman. Don't worry
about losing your job.

166
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:56,425
We need to focus on how
you lost your daughter.

167
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,685
That's why I've assembled
this crack team

168
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:00,500
of daughter dads
to help you out.

169
00:08:00,524 --> 00:08:03,415
I think you'll find
they're the finest men around.

170
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:06,601
Welcome to P.F. Thong's.
You boys ready to order?

171
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:10,605
I will have the Lettuce D-Cups,
um, with a chicken side piece.

172
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,093
I will have the Wedgie Salad
and the Baby Got Back Ribs.

173
00:08:15,187 --> 00:08:17,855
Oh, and, uh, some Sprung Rolls
for the table.

174
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:20,375
I don't have much
of an appetite.

175
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,262
See, I, well,
I haven't talked to my daughter

176
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:24,194
in years, and, um...

177
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:26,548
Say no more. I'll bring you
a Dead Beet Salad

178
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:28,399
and a Coke Zero Contact.

179
00:08:29,778 --> 00:08:33,198
So, if your estranged daughter
writes an angry book about you,

180
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:35,926
don't self-publish
your rebuttal book.

181
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:39,779
Uh, thanks for all
the advice, fellas.

182
00:08:39,803 --> 00:08:41,136
Dad-vice.

183
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,932
I-It's just,
I haven't talked to Amber

184
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,878
in over a decade. I-I don't
even know where to begin.

185
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:47,981
You just got to show her
you still care.

186
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:50,290
Pick up the damn phone.
Call her.

187
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:53,283
Call her! Call her! Call her!

188
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:57,653
Call her! Call her! Call her!

189
00:08:57,806 --> 00:08:59,225
I'm on the phone with her now.

190
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:02,250
Ignore us. Ignore us. Ignore us.

191
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,251
Amber, I was just wondering, um,

192
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:07,163
could I maybe drive up there
to see you sometime?

193
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,235
Uh, this weekend, maybe?

194
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:11,644
She said, "I guess."

195
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:14,836
No, not...

196
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,149
Because what if I screw up?

197
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:17,432
What if Amber hates me? I...

198
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,561
I need you to come
with me, please.

199
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:22,437
A road trip with Duffman.
Woo-hoo!

200
00:09:22,587 --> 00:09:24,513
You, me, and Lisa.

201
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,162
Bonet? This trip just keeps
getting better.

202
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:29,426
No, no, no, your Lisa.

203
00:09:29,504 --> 00:09:30,945
I need both my girl-dad guru

204
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:33,673
and his dad-girl-daughter
for inspiration.

205
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:38,193
Lisa! Lisa, you're coming
with me and Duffman

206
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:39,953
on a road trip to Glendon Falls.

207
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:41,197
What?

208
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:43,515
- Why would I want to do that?
- Hmm.

209
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:46,605
Marge, why would Lisa want to go
to Glendon Falls

210
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:47,854
with me and Duffman?

211
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:52,040
Well, that's near
the Agatha Christie Museum

212
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,612
of Quirky Detectives.

213
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:55,780
Lisa likes Agatha Christie?

214
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,357
I love Agatha Christie,

215
00:09:57,381 --> 00:09:59,548
and that museum
is gonna be amazing.

216
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:02,679
Ooh! Ah, I can't
believe you remembered.

217
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,370
They're having a special exhibit
this weekend

218
00:10:05,464 --> 00:10:07,981
on her ten reddest herrings.

219
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,152
Thank you.
You're the best dad ever.

220
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:13,654
Aw, you don't have to thank me.

221
00:10:13,806 --> 00:10:16,573
Do it later in front of Duffman.

222
00:10:18,476 --> 00:10:22,216
Man, I can't believe I'm on
a road trip with my hero.

223
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,389
Wow, your little daughter's
your hero?

224
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:26,149
That's so sweet.

225
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:29,077
And that's exactly
who I was referring to.

226
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,746
Oh, hey, we should put on music
that Lisa likes, huh?

227
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:33,749
Okay, Lisa likes jazz.

228
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,062
That's a thing I know.

229
00:10:35,086 --> 00:10:37,494
Mm, I'm not in the mood
for jazz right now.

230
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:39,754
Let's listen to
my second favorite.

231
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:41,826
Salsa? Old-school rap?

232
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,017
Traffic on the twos?

233
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:44,851
I like K-pop, Dad.

234
00:10:45,004 --> 00:10:47,524
Wh... Oh, uh, of course.
I knew that.

235
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:50,836
It's fun to pretend
that you're clueless.

236
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,837
Beautiful.

237
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,678
♪ <i>We are the lovesick girls</i> ♪

238
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:00,086
Oh, yeah!

239
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,453
♪ <i>We are the lovesick girls.</i> ♪

240
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:08,524
Dad, I don't need you
to do that.

241
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:11,028
They always try to be older

242
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:12,714
than they are, don't they?

243
00:11:12,941 --> 00:11:14,215
Oh, man, such good fathering.

244
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:16,458
Not like... Duffman.

245
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,700
Would it help to talk
about Amber?

246
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,967
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

247
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:28,136
<i>But then I became Duffman,</i>

248
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,767
<i>and, well,
you know what they say,</i>

249
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,952
<i>"With great pilsner
comes great infidelity."</i>

250
00:11:32,976 --> 00:11:35,736
<i>Her mom left me
when Amber was four.</i>

251
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,775
And by the end of high school,
Amber hated me.

252
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,840
Said she never wanted
to talk to me again,

253
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,190
and I guess I just believed her.

254
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:44,298
Yes, believe women.

255
00:11:44,322 --> 00:11:47,490
No, she was a kid.
She didn't mean it.

256
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:49,250
Yes, believe Lisa.

257
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,304
I think about her every day,
and I...

258
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:53,629
I keep this drawing with me
wherever I go.

259
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,809
Aw, you need to tell her
all of this.

260
00:11:56,834 --> 00:12:00,094
I bet she's been waiting for you
to reach out for years.

261
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:02,822
Oh, Lisa, you are so sweet

262
00:12:02,914 --> 00:12:04,248
and so wise.

263
00:12:04,341 --> 00:12:06,674
Guh-reat job, Homer!

264
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,246
Homer, Homer!

265
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,178
<i>Guess what.</i>

266
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:12,250
They give you
a real tea set to drop

267
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:15,091
when you walk in the drawing
room and find a dead body.

268
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:18,671
Brandon, what is up?

269
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:20,000
Seriously, like, uh, what's up?

270
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:21,710
<i>Not your election numbers,
Duff-bro.</i>

271
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:23,003
<i>They're dismal.</i>

272
00:12:23,027 --> 00:12:25,154
Look, you're near
the corporate mascot convention

273
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,120
at the Conventions. Comventions

274
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,437
convention center.

275
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:30,865
It'd be a great chance
to drum up some support.

276
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,586
<i>He'll do it, Brandon.</i>

277
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,014
<i>Duffman cannot lose
this election.</i>

278
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:36,705
But what about the museum?

279
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,851
There's plenty of time for both.

280
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,177
That's a proud papa pledge.

281
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:52,705
Hey-ya, Chief,
can I count on you for a...

282
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:54,315
middle finger, okay.

283
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:57,375
Ooh, I bet this guy's
a registered Duffocrat.

284
00:12:57,469 --> 00:13:00,153
Uh-oh, he flashed a gun.
My goodness.

285
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,155
Anyone? Anyone want a selfie?

286
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:04,826
We could use my phone.
I can Air...

287
00:13:04,976 --> 00:13:06,304
Drop it to you.

288
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:07,956
In five minutes,

289
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,739
join us in Ballroom C
for a panel discussion.

290
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,649
The Charlie Tuna Conundrum...

291
00:13:12,743 --> 00:13:15,126
When the Mascot Is the Product.

292
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,067
Attention, everyone,

293
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:24,230
Duffman is sitting
all by himself in Hallway B.

294
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:25,921
Please just go say hi to him.

295
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:28,256
He really needs this. And, uh,

296
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:29,995
don't listen to this
if you're him.

297
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:32,572
Oh, my God.

298
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:34,913
Can I get your autograph... pen?

299
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:37,692
I got to get a signature
from the Mucinex loogie.

300
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:40,443
He is so hot.

301
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,938
Losing to a loogie.

302
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,183
Dad, shouldn't we get going?

303
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:49,095
The museum closes at 5:00.

304
00:13:49,187 --> 00:13:51,850
Don't worry, sweetie,
I'm keeping an eye on the time.

305
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,374
It's only 2:30.

306
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:57,523
That's not a real clock!

307
00:13:57,547 --> 00:14:01,173
That's the mascot
for Tea Time Tamales.

308
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,384
Oh, my God, no.

309
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,038
Wait! Wait!

310
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:10,777
No, don't close!

311
00:14:10,801 --> 00:14:12,278
You can't close yet.

312
00:14:12,302 --> 00:14:14,895
Mm, sorry, kid, we're shutting
down for three months

313
00:14:15,123 --> 00:14:16,639
to build a new attraction.

314
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,451
Aw, nuts.

315
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:21,402
You got to stay open.
We drove all this way,

316
00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:23,645
and I'm a second grader
who solves murders

317
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,216
on a sixth-grade level.

318
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,552
Well, look who I brought.

319
00:14:26,576 --> 00:14:29,721
I can unlock a lot of things
for Duffman,

320
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,537
but not this museum.

321
00:14:39,404 --> 00:14:41,923
Well, this calls
for some expert dadding.

322
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:44,149
Lisa, honey,
tell Daddy what's wrong.

323
00:14:44,243 --> 00:14:45,834
This is all your fault.

324
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,648
That's right.

325
00:14:47,672 --> 00:14:49,837
- Let it out.
- Okay,

326
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,264
I am tired of you pretending

327
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:54,100
that you're some sort of
ideal dad when this whole trip

328
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:57,663
you've been kissing
Duffman's cans.

329
00:14:57,755 --> 00:14:59,999
See, I knew you
wouldn't have any fun.

330
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:02,308
That's why I didn't think
you should come. Eh...

331
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:03,535
Uh-oh.

332
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:06,832
You didn't even want
to bring me.

333
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:08,282
You were just using me

334
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:11,337
as some kind of girl-dad prop,

335
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:13,506
just like Duffman did.

336
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,029
Don't ever

337
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:16,698
talk to me

338
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,167
again.

339
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:24,780
She'll get over this, right?

340
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,634
Mine did not.

341
00:15:26,784 --> 00:15:29,345
Oh...

342
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,783
Ready, handsome?

343
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,640
You're leaving?

344
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:36,143
Duffman just realized that you

345
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,629
are not a good dad. Uh-uh.

346
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:42,890
I'm all yours... Renata.

347
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:43,966
Fun name.

348
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:45,740
Renata.

349
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:48,322
Oh...

350
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,807
So...

351
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:57,414
what you reading there?

352
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,393
Come on,
you got to say something.

353
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:02,981
Something.

354
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,484
Ooh, I can't handle
the silent treatment.

355
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:07,376
Don't leave me alone
with my brain.

356
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,677
- I remember this one time...
- Eyes on the road!

357
00:16:12,682 --> 00:16:16,258
Oh, Duffman left Amber's drawing
in the car.

358
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,830
It's really a shame about them.

359
00:16:17,854 --> 00:16:20,520
It is. He really does
love her, you know.

360
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:23,356
Maybe, but Duffman should've
spent more time listening

361
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:27,080
to Amber instead of thinking
only about himself.

362
00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:29,416
Well, maybe sometimes
Duffman's scared to listen

363
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,700
because he'll hear about all
the dumb stuff he screwed up.

364
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:35,014
Sure, but maybe
he should be brave enough

365
00:16:35,038 --> 00:16:37,015
to admit he's not perfect.

366
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,932
Not even close to perfect.

367
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:41,519
Oh...

368
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,692
I think we should
take this to them.

369
00:16:43,788 --> 00:16:47,548
Yeah. I hope they work
things out before it's too late.

370
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:50,884
Me, too, Dad.
That would be really great.

371
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:58,202
Good luck, buddy.
I'm rooting for you.

372
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,210
Thank you, Evan, and good luck

373
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:02,437
with your MFA. Oh, yeah.

374
00:17:08,386 --> 00:17:10,738
Okay, here we go.
Time to prove to your daughter

375
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:12,458
that you've changed.

376
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:13,482
Ah. Damn.

377
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:14,868
A little help, bro?

378
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:16,911
Dude, it's Duffman.

379
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:18,746
Join our rager!

380
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:20,466
Oh, yeah.

381
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,084
I mean, no, no.
Not who I am anymore.

382
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,980
Okay.

383
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,075
I can't believe you're here

384
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:34,409
because I don't know you,
and I did not invite you.

385
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:36,931
Oh, what an odd thing to say.

386
00:17:37,082 --> 00:17:39,325
Hi, I'm Homer, and this is Lisa.

387
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:41,304
We have something
to give to your dad.

388
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:43,081
Yeah, well, I can't help you.

389
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,680
He never showed.

390
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:47,251
I don't get it.

391
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,518
If I know Duffman,
and I briefly did,

392
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,423
nothing was more important
to him than seeing you.

393
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:53,855
He was so excited.

394
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,526
Really? As excited as he was
to miss every dance recital,

395
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,695
every graduation,
every art show?

396
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,508
No. More.

397
00:18:02,532 --> 00:18:04,418
Your dad taught me
the importance

398
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:06,868
of not taking my daughter's
love for granted.

399
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:08,628
Duffman's really changed.

400
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:10,355
Trust me, when you see him next,

401
00:18:10,415 --> 00:18:12,781
you'll be amazed
at how enlightened

402
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:15,113
and sensitive he's become.

403
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:17,340
Chicken fight!

404
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:18,972
♪ <i>Doo, bow, bow...</i> ♪

405
00:18:19,124 --> 00:18:20,789
Come on, friend!

406
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:23,287
What the crap?

407
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,511
No, Amber, I was just about
to knock on your door.

408
00:18:25,556 --> 00:18:26,635
You have to believe me.

409
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:29,034
It's true.
This whole chicken fight,

410
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:30,853
it felt like
he was somewhere else.

411
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:33,820
I'm sorry, Colleen, but if this
teaches you anything,

412
00:18:33,971 --> 00:18:36,990
it's that you should work on
your relationship with your dad.

413
00:18:37,218 --> 00:18:39,734
I have a great
relationship with my dad.

414
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,738
I just also like bikinis
and parties, you jerk.

415
00:18:42,814 --> 00:18:44,330
Duffman respects your journey.

416
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:46,416
Amber? Amber!

417
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:49,560
Amber!

418
00:18:49,654 --> 00:18:50,837
Ah, Amber...

419
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,151
Hey, uh, pal...
Whoa, that's Duffman!

420
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:55,659
Amber, look out!

421
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:03,517
You saved me...

422
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,269
Dad.

423
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:11,025
So, the chick magnet
is also a daughter magnet,

424
00:19:11,175 --> 00:19:12,526
I get it now.

425
00:19:12,678 --> 00:19:15,345
All chicks
are somebody's daughter.

426
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:18,272
- No. Uh-uh.
- Yeah, try again.

427
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:20,701
Some chicks are guys,
and that's okay.

428
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:22,109
Mm... Mm-mm.

429
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:24,096
- Hmm.
- It-It's okay, Dad.

430
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:26,280
B-Baby steps, I guess.

431
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:29,201
Give her this now.

432
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:32,378
No way. I haven't
seen this in ages.

433
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:34,288
I look at it every single day.

434
00:19:34,442 --> 00:19:38,029
I miss you so much, and
I should've been there for you.

435
00:19:38,054 --> 00:19:41,055
Dad, I'm so glad
you're back in my life,

436
00:19:41,205 --> 00:19:43,183
and I really hope that...

437
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,874
Ugh, seriously?

438
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:46,779
<i>Duffman, amazing news.</i>

439
00:19:46,804 --> 00:19:48,895
- You won the election.
- Oh, yeah?

440
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:50,208
Oh, yeah.

441
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:52,210
Some kid posted video
of you singing K-pop,

442
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,937
and their fan army voted
for you en freakin' masse.

443
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,455
I need you on
the next plane to Korea.

444
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,480
Kim Jong-un wants to kidnap you
and make a movie together.

445
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:00,982
Oh, yeah!

446
00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:05,988
Aw, you know what?
I think I have had enough

447
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,558
of that wonderful Duff.

448
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,491
What? You'll never work in
the adult beverage game again.

449
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:14,380
<i>No beer, no hard seltzer,
no kombucha.</i>

450
00:20:15,906 --> 00:20:17,374
Duff Nation, Duffman is here

451
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:20,318
to get you wrecked
in a whole new way as...

452
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:22,653
Puffman.

453
00:20:22,748 --> 00:20:25,324
Come check out my daughter's
brand-new weed store

454
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,745
featuring her custom-made,
one of a kind,

455
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,435
glass bongs.

456
00:20:30,998 --> 00:20:33,826
Oh, yeah. If any of my other
estranged daughters

457
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:35,753
are watching, hit me up.

458
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:37,352
Wait, your what?
