1
00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:07,211
Barney,
did you finish your milk?

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,250
Yes, Ma.

3
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:11,573
Have fun playing in the gutter!

4
00:00:11,657 --> 00:00:13,409
Anchors aweigh!

5
00:00:15,497 --> 00:00:16,450
It's floating.

6
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:17,819
It's still floating!

7
00:00:17,903 --> 00:00:21,225
This is fun to me.
I love you, paper boat!

8
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:23,597
Oh, no!

9
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:25,484
Aw...

10
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:27,905
Hiya, Barn.

11
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:30,009
I'm Krusto, the funniest clown

12
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:31,880
in the whole wide world.

13
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:35,421
Uh, people who have to tell you
they're funny usually aren't.

14
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:37,692
Can I get my boat back,
sewer clown?

15
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:38,994
Why, sure.

16
00:00:39,078 --> 00:00:42,284
Just reach in and take it.

17
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:45,306
Hmm.

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,947
That's right, build the tension.

19
00:00:50,602 --> 00:00:51,786
Aah!

20
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,924
Keep the boat!
Keep the boat!

21
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:57,397
Ow! Ow!

22
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:14,999
Don't worry, Barn.

23
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:18,423
When a kid goes missing in this
town, we find them.

24
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:21,296
Hmm... Mm...

25
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:23,417
Sorry, Waylon.

26
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:24,686
Hey there, Ruthie.

27
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,222
How are the little ones?

28
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:29,061
Oh, you know kids.
Still miss in.'

29
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:31,766
Ah, they disappear
so fast, don't they?

30
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:44,893
Hey there, Simpson.

31
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:47,230
Super-Intense-Kid Chalmers!

32
00:01:47,314 --> 00:01:50,069
Look what I traded my dog for.

33
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:54,362
Huh?

34
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,921
Creepy clown, go get help!

35
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:00,390
- Hmm? - Hmm?
- Hmm?

36
00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:06,836
After him!

37
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:19,361
Step away from
the whimpering coward.

38
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:27,595
Time to bring out the big guns.

39
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:35,260
Aah!

40
00:02:35,344 --> 00:02:36,896
It's a fair fight.

41
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,165
Let's run away!

42
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:41,973
Hmm?

43
00:02:42,057 --> 00:02:45,447
Oh, oh, you're hurt,
you poor thing.

44
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:48,620
No girl has ever
called me a "thing" before.

45
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,156
I've seen you guys around.

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,193
You're the school outsiders,
aren't you?

47
00:02:52,277 --> 00:02:55,634
We sure are.
The comic book nerd, the tomboy.

48
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:57,070
The scuzz.

49
00:02:57,154 --> 00:02:59,308
And the one Black kid
in all of Maine.

50
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:01,546
We call ourselves
The Losers Club.

51
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,519
It's a name we are
no longer fighting.

52
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:05,721
Ooh.

53
00:03:05,805 --> 00:03:09,713
We have a first aid kit
in our clubhouse. Come on.

54
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:13,069
Um, FYI, new guy.

55
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:15,474
I called dibs on Marge
in the second grade.

56
00:03:15,558 --> 00:03:17,143
Find your own secret knockout

57
00:03:17,227 --> 00:03:20,635
who doesn't recognize
her own self-worth.

58
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:24,459
Sweet clubhouse, right?

59
00:03:24,543 --> 00:03:27,465
They used it to store
tartar sauce during the war.

60
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:29,602
You're all gonna
think I'm crazy,

61
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:32,173
but when those bullies
were gonna kill me,

62
00:03:32,257 --> 00:03:35,246
I saw an evil clown.

63
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,085
I-I've seen the clown, too.

64
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:41,610
I was in the bathroom,
uh, painting my nails...

65
00:03:42,377 --> 00:03:44,097
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow!

66
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:47,203
Hmm?

67
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:49,809
Come on, I need water.

68
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:51,111
How's about...

69
00:03:51,195 --> 00:03:53,115
a little seltzer?

70
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,370
Aah!

71
00:03:58,778 --> 00:03:59,829
Help!

72
00:03:59,913 --> 00:04:02,317
He...

73
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:08,079
Holy moly,

74
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:09,482
bleach your mustache.

75
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:11,804
You look like El DeBarge.

76
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:15,961
The clown knew my greatest fear:

77
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:18,834
Drowning in seltzer.

78
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:21,171
Mm.

79
00:04:21,255 --> 00:04:22,641
I saw the clown, too.

80
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:26,281
<i>But he came to me
as a ventriloquist dummy.</i>

81
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:28,787
- Hey, kid.
- Hmm?

82
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:31,944
I went on a date
with your mother last night.

83
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:36,201
You might want to check her
for splinters!

84
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,481
He was implying they made love.

85
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:44,338
I was in my bedroom, reading.

86
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,529
Wanna swap spit?

87
00:04:49,613 --> 00:04:51,617
Aah!

88
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:53,770
Aah!

89
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:55,306
I saw him too.

90
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,547
He came to me as the rotting
corpse of my grandmother

91
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,635
in a hot tub full of maggots.

92
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:03,322
We get it, we get it,
no need for a flashback.

93
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:05,259
I bet that evil clown is the one

94
00:05:05,343 --> 00:05:07,397
who took all the missing kids
in town.

95
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:10,169
We need to find out
what we're up against.

96
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:13,710
Which means doing the thing
we all fear most:

97
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:14,946
- Homework.
- Aah!

98
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,569
- Oh God, no.
- But it's summer.

99
00:05:24,816 --> 00:05:26,803
<i>Your arm is summer lightning.</i>

100
00:05:26,887 --> 00:05:28,707
<i>Your bravery, the storm.</i>

101
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,343
Hmm.

102
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:33,868
<i>Like a chimp at the zoo,
I'm bananas for you.</i>

103
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:40,931
Homer!

104
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:44,021
Homer, I found him.
In this.

105
00:05:47,862 --> 00:05:50,349
The clown has been
in King field before.

106
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,888
He's always been here.

107
00:05:52,972 --> 00:05:54,625
<i>Channel 14 and Fume Champ</i>

108
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:57,096
<i>Super-Leaded Gasoline present</i>

109
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,537
The Yuk-Yuk Hour
with Krusto the Clown.

110
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:04,077
Hey, hey!

111
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:07,050
Thanks for the big hand.

112
00:06:08,604 --> 00:06:12,060
In 1936 he had a radio hour.

113
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:14,364
In 1909, a vaudeville review.

114
00:06:14,448 --> 00:06:17,605
And in 1882, he was
an emcee for a freak show.

115
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:19,509
And the strangest thing is...

116
00:06:19,593 --> 00:06:23,115
He was never, ever funny.

117
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,754
He comes back every 27 years.

118
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:27,157
And when he does...

119
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:30,081
<i>I gorge myself on pre-teens.</i>

120
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,118
Aah!

121
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:39,281
Aah! Oh.

122
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:47,765
What's the difference
between a Twinkie and a fat kid?

123
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:51,038
I don't feel guilty
when I eat a fat kid.

124
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:56,499
Ah...

125
00:06:57,502 --> 00:06:59,806
Homer, catch!

126
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:02,461
Gah! My wattle!

127
00:07:02,545 --> 00:07:04,632
My beautiful wattle!

128
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:08,072
Now I'm really big and scary!

129
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:14,050
Temporary setba...

130
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,656
I don't want to die
and be buried in a kid coffin.

131
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,361
It costs the same
as a regular-sized.

132
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:22,400
I overheard my parents
pricing 'em.

133
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,772
Calm down.

134
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:27,410
Well, that's my fetish now.

135
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:28,813
Look, don't you see?

136
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:30,216
We hurt him.

137
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,155
And if we can hurt him,
we can kill him.

138
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:34,324
Ooh.

139
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:36,261
Oh...

140
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,283
Hmm?

141
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,572
"Bananas for you"?

142
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,926
- Mm?
- Oh!

143
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:55,161
That romantic
son of a bitch.

144
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:58,152
When she reads this,
she'll be his forever.

145
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,737
Free candy?

146
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:17,707
Let's eat it
before the clown shows up!

147
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,812
- Aah!
- Aah!

148
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:21,716
Hey, hey, kids!

149
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,185
What time is it?

150
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,124
<i>Time to laugh for Krusto.</i>

151
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,444
Attack!

152
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:32,503
Our whimsical weapons...
They're useless.

153
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:34,608
Don't you kids get it?

154
00:08:34,692 --> 00:08:36,378
I'm completely invinci...

155
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:38,834
Whoa!

156
00:08:45,513 --> 00:08:47,400
Aah!

157
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:51,408
Oh!

158
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:56,518
Wait, I never
heard that before.

159
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,926
Real laughter.
That I actually earned.

160
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,530
Hey, hey, kids,
if you like that,

161
00:09:02,614 --> 00:09:04,067
watch this.

162
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:08,810
Hot!

163
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,587
Eh? Eh?

164
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:16,692
He's killing himself
for laughs.

165
00:09:16,776 --> 00:09:18,495
Hey, clown.

166
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:20,050
Why don't you eat these?

167
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:23,807
Oh!
Cherry bombs in the mouth.

168
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:25,460
That's a great gag.

169
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:27,865
Oh...

170
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:32,423
So this is what it feels like
not to bomb.

171
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:33,626
Whoa!

172
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:38,653
No, you tricked me!

173
00:09:39,321 --> 00:09:41,876
You're nothing
but a bunch of losers.

174
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,014
And that's all you'll ever be!

175
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,253
We're not dead.

176
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,522
Somebody pinch me.

177
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:49,759
Somebody slap me.

178
00:09:49,843 --> 00:09:52,063
A-Any one of yo use.
Doesn't-doesn't matter.

179
00:09:52,147 --> 00:09:53,933
Guys, let's make a pact:

180
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:56,104
If the clown comes back
in 27 years,

181
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:57,440
no matter where we all end up,

182
00:09:57,524 --> 00:10:00,898
we'll come back home
and finish the job.

183
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:06,024
Now let's find out
if this water is deep enough

184
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:08,246
for jumpin'!

185
00:10:09,548 --> 00:10:10,918
Uh...

186
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:12,637
- Mwah.
- Huh?

187
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,307
I got your poem.

188
00:10:14,391 --> 00:10:18,817
I want my first love to be
the boy who wrote those words.

189
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:21,621
B-By that, you mean me,
of course.

190
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,211
Kiss me
for the rest of the summer.

191
00:10:26,148 --> 00:10:28,302
Wait, this isn't right.

192
00:10:28,386 --> 00:10:31,041
I'm the one I wanted Marge
to fall in love with.

193
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,677
Eh, cheer up, Homer.

194
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:34,782
We got our whole lives
ahead of us.

195
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:36,585
Maybe you guys do.

196
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,925
I think mine just ended.

197
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:41,929
Oh, Marge.
Mwah, kissing.

198
00:10:42,013 --> 00:10:43,599
- This.
- I'm so happy.

199
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:45,086
Oh yes.

200
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,685
Hey,

201
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:56,375
that bakery wasn't here
this morning.

202
00:10:57,144 --> 00:10:59,865
Well, there's no kids around.

203
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:01,736
Might as well bully adults.

204
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,140
Hey Pie Man!
Gimme a...

205
00:11:05,693 --> 00:11:07,881
Dude, are you okay?

206
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:18,135
Oh, Moleman,

207
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,807
I can't imagine my life
without you seated next to me

208
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:23,479
every night
here at D'ohs Tavern.

209
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:24,547
You're my best friend.

210
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:26,518
I'm cold.

211
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:29,290
Hmm?

212
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:31,796
One teen was killed
by a pie to the face.

213
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,367
Another's intestines were
twisted into balloon animals.

214
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:37,140
And the last, choked by a chain
of hankies so long,

215
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:39,077
police are still pulling it out.

216
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:41,581
No, the clown can't be back.

217
00:11:41,665 --> 00:11:43,352
Unless it's...

218
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,824
27 years later.

219
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:49,464
I got to tell the other Losers
that it's time to come home,

220
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:51,168
so we can end this.

221
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:55,709
I wonder if their lives
turned out as lousy as mine.

222
00:11:57,865 --> 00:12:00,052
♪ Here I am ♪

223
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:03,190
♪ Rock you like a hurricane ♪

224
00:12:05,213 --> 00:12:06,766
♪ Here I am. ♪

225
00:12:11,158 --> 00:12:13,412
Thank you, Las Vegas.

226
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:14,731
Yeah, rock and roll.

227
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,288
Message for you
from your old hometown.

228
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:21,561
Something about
a childhood pact.

229
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:22,764
Ah...

230
00:12:22,848 --> 00:12:25,703
A pact is a pact.
I'm on my way.

231
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,442
Uh, I got to go, guys.

232
00:12:28,526 --> 00:12:31,348
Oh, here's the instructions
for destroying the asteroid.

233
00:12:31,432 --> 00:12:32,784
You got this!

234
00:12:32,868 --> 00:12:34,487
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

235
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:37,527
Homer, it's so nice
to hear your voice

236
00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:39,765
after all these years.

237
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:42,403
Wow, CEO of your own company.

238
00:12:42,487 --> 00:12:45,944
You know, I pictured you growing
up to be a softball superstar.

239
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:48,448
Aw, you were always so sweet.

240
00:12:48,532 --> 00:12:49,852
How have you been?

241
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,724
So good.
I practically live on Reddit.

242
00:12:52,808 --> 00:12:54,527
But did you ever get the feeling

243
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:57,466
that we missed our chance?

244
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,103
I do.
I sure wish

245
00:12:59,187 --> 00:13:01,474
we'd done it 27 years ago.

246
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:04,715
Me too!
Oh, it's all I think about.

247
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:07,019
Oh, you mean kill Krusto.

248
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:08,923
Yeah, that would've
been good, too.

249
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:12,230
Oh, I want to help,
but I'm not sure I can.

250
00:13:12,314 --> 00:13:14,802
I have responsibilities now.

251
00:13:14,886 --> 00:13:16,906
- Hi, Mom.
- What up, Big Blue?

252
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,410
Bert, my little jazz tubist.

253
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:22,216
And Lizzie,
my special little gal.

254
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,191
Mom, I got an A-plus on my
Elizabeth Cady Stanton diorama.

255
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:28,061
I threw a stink bomb
in the teacher's lounge

256
00:13:28,145 --> 00:13:29,364
and bike-locked the door.

257
00:13:29,448 --> 00:13:32,905
Well, I'm so proud
of one of those things.

258
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:34,842
Who's Homer Simpson?

259
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:36,746
That's a dumb-ass name.

260
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,448
Really?
Our father's name is...

261
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:40,152
Comic Book Guy.

262
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,125
Homer Simpson is someone
we knew back in King field.

263
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:46,665
A town we will
never set foot in again.

264
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:48,035
Mm...

265
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,905
Homer needs us.
We're the only ones

266
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:51,776
who can kill the clown.

267
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,045
We're adults now.

268
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:55,583
A kid murderer is a kid problem.

269
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:59,190
What happened to the boy
who admired my bravery so much

270
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:00,927
he put it in a poem?

271
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:02,998
B-By that, you mean me,
of course.

272
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:05,069
Well, I am a husband now,
and a father.

273
00:14:05,153 --> 00:14:06,906
And I'm-I'm...

274
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,310
- I'm...
- The same little coward...

275
00:14:09,394 --> 00:14:11,699
You always were!

276
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,786
Aah!

277
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,024
Marge, I had a dream
about him.

278
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:17,928
He was just as scary
as I remember,

279
00:14:18,012 --> 00:14:20,566
but updated
for a Gen Z audience.

280
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,554
Honey? Honey?

281
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,615
To the Losers.

282
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:30,586
The Losers.

283
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,993
So, how the hell are we gonna
stop that unkillable clown?

284
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:36,064
We ain't exactly children
no more.

285
00:14:36,148 --> 00:14:38,168
Yeah, but we're still friends.

286
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,072
We're still
full of childlike wonder.

287
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:41,842
We're still virgins.

288
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:43,378
- Eesh.
- Mm...

289
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:46,719
Yeah, we're still, uh...

290
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:50,359
Well, whenever
I need to find my courage,

291
00:14:50,443 --> 00:14:53,699
I think of a poem Comic Book Guy
wrote for me when we were kids.

292
00:14:53,783 --> 00:14:55,202
Poem?

293
00:14:55,286 --> 00:14:57,390
It's why
I fell in love with him.

294
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,177
Marge, there's something

295
00:14:59,261 --> 00:15:01,414
I have to tell you right now,

296
00:15:01,498 --> 00:15:04,153
because if I wait
even one more second...

297
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:08,261
I'm talking one single second,
just one...

298
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:09,965
Something might happen
that will make me not...

299
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:12,036
BERT and LIZZIE: Mom!

300
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,140
Oh... be able to tell you.

301
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:17,246
Kids, no,
what are you doing here?

302
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,217
They're here
to collect their mother.

303
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:21,621
Kids, be good
and wait in the car.

304
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:25,446
Mommy and Daddy have some
grown-up yelling to discuss.

305
00:15:26,248 --> 00:15:28,702
Mom and Dad's hometown
sure sucks.

306
00:15:28,786 --> 00:15:32,643
Misspelled pet cemetery,
Salem's parking lot,

307
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:37,119
mysterious antique store
that charges by the soul.

308
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,890
What the hell are you watching?

309
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:40,426
Oh...

310
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,565
Wake up!
We barely escaped last time.

311
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:46,872
Why risk our lives now
when we have so much to lose?

312
00:15:46,956 --> 00:15:48,141
Present Homers excluded.

313
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:54,387
<i>Hope you Losers weren't
thinking of leaving just yet.</i>

314
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:58,128
<i>Not without seeing
my new star attraction.</i>

315
00:15:58,212 --> 00:15:59,430
<i>Help, Mom!</i>

316
00:15:59,514 --> 00:16:02,636
<i>Dad, get your fat ass
down here!</i>

317
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,638
No!

318
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:09,684
Our kids!

319
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:10,954
Our phones.

320
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:13,025
Now it's personal.

321
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:16,715
Just like it always was.

322
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:24,748
I smell
thousand-year-old flop sweat.

323
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:26,468
We must be close.

324
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,575
- Finally!
- Mom, Dad!

325
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,645
Up here!

326
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,167
Kids! Oh...

327
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:35,436
Aah!

328
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,043
Well, well.
If it isn't the Losers.

329
00:16:39,127 --> 00:16:42,534
Say hello to my studio audience.

330
00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:53,672
There's no laughter
like forced laughter.

331
00:16:53,756 --> 00:16:56,411
We're not afraid of you
anymore, clown.

332
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:58,381
You have no power over us.

333
00:16:58,465 --> 00:17:01,454
He's an astronaut,
she's a seltzer big wig,

334
00:17:01,538 --> 00:17:03,558
and I'm a world-famous,

335
00:17:03,642 --> 00:17:06,164
um, virgin.

336
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:07,466
Oh, damn it.

337
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,874
The point is we've conquered
our childhood fears.

338
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:15,115
Ah, but adults have something
much tastier than fears.

339
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,351
Anxieties.

340
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,422
Millions of tiny,

341
00:17:18,506 --> 00:17:21,194
delicious anxieties.

342
00:17:22,747 --> 00:17:24,518
Oh!

343
00:17:27,557 --> 00:17:29,076
You know what I'm thankful for?

344
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,683
The filibuster.
Let's talk about it.

345
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:33,719
Aah!

346
00:17:35,373 --> 00:17:37,828
But you... you've got something

347
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:40,365
worth worrying about.

348
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:42,269
Why don't I tell Marge

349
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,307
you put your name on the poem

350
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:46,762
that won her heart, eh?

351
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,321
No, no, please.

352
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,258
It-it wasn't you?

353
00:17:53,342 --> 00:17:56,331
I tried to tell you,
just not very hard.

354
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:58,602
My life is a lie.

355
00:17:58,686 --> 00:17:59,989
Oh...

356
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:04,614
He must get his sinister powers

357
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:06,819
from his captive audience.

358
00:18:06,903 --> 00:18:08,655
Just like Jimmy Fallon.

359
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:11,745
You have to destroy the sign!

360
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:18,475
Only you can do it, Marge.

361
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,479
Your arm is summer lightning.

362
00:18:20,563 --> 00:18:22,316
Your bravery, the storm.

363
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,487
You're the chimp in the zoo.

364
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:27,459
And I'm still bananas for you.

365
00:18:27,543 --> 00:18:30,516
Now, throw, throw!

366
00:18:31,718 --> 00:18:33,171
Hmm?

367
00:18:33,255 --> 00:18:35,008
Ah...

368
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,946
No!

369
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:50,907
Why were we laughing?

370
00:18:50,991 --> 00:18:52,509
This show sucks.

371
00:18:52,593 --> 00:18:53,813
Let's go up to heaven

372
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:56,584
and bask in the glory
of God's stupid love.

373
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:01,661
My audience! No!

374
00:19:01,745 --> 00:19:04,000
It took me years to grow them.

375
00:19:04,084 --> 00:19:05,870
Eh?

376
00:19:05,954 --> 00:19:08,375
Aah! Oh... Oh!

377
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:10,980
I can't start over! Oh!

378
00:19:11,064 --> 00:19:12,316
What would that even look like?

379
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,725
Dancing for followers on TikTok?

380
00:19:17,745 --> 00:19:20,750
I haven't written a joke
since 1647.

381
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,638
Aah!
And that material has not...

382
00:19:23,722 --> 00:19:25,843
Aged...

383
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:28,014
well. Oh...

384
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:30,971
I blame cancel culture.

385
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:35,997
You were finally brave.

386
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:39,805
Does this make up for
lying to you all these years?

387
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:41,374
Oh, honey.

388
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,178
Of course not.

389
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:44,932
No, I get it.

390
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:48,205
Mm...

391
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,727
<i>Growing up isn't easy.</i>

392
00:19:50,811 --> 00:19:53,398
<i>The traumas we lived as kids
can haunt us forever,</i>

393
00:19:53,482 --> 00:19:56,070
<i>lurking in the corners
of our mind.</i>

394
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,506
<i>We can't undo the harm,</i>

395
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,911
<i>but with a little help,
we can survive it.</i>

396
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:04,504
<i>And live the life
we were always meant to.</i>

397
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:09,163
The humans have vanquished
our thousand-year-old clown,

398
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:12,670
but surely they will be no match
for our next nightmare...

399
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:15,743
A Saint Bernard with rabies.

400
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:17,146
Mm...

401
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,648
An angry car?

402
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:21,789
Put that in the "maybe" pile.

403
00:20:21,873 --> 00:20:25,591
How about a prom
that goes seriously wrong?

404
00:20:26,114 --> 00:20:27,599
Haunted hotel?

405
00:20:27,683 --> 00:20:29,555
What about some Tommyknockers?

406
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,500
Those sound scary.

407
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:33,746
Yes, yes!

408
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,457
- Tommyknockers.
- Tommyknockers.

409
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:45,437
<i>- Tommyknockers.
- Tommyknockers.</i>
