1
00:00:02,437 --> 00:00:04,104
(gulping)

2
00:00:04,106 --> 00:00:08,884
-(screaming)
    - Somewhere up there

3
00:00:08,886 --> 00:00:12,112
Beyond the blue

4
00:00:12,114 --> 00:00:14,205
There's love

5
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:16,374
For me

6
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:19,710
- And you. 
         -HOMER: Ah...!

7
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,454
(screams, whimpers)

8
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:23,440
-(rapid instrumental)
   -(all vocalizing dizzily)

9
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:29,321
(all yelling)

10
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,625
(screaming)

11
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:45,754
(song stops)

12
00:00:49,668 --> 00:00:51,635
(belches loudly)

13
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:05,107
WIFE: Oh, my gosh! It's what
  you thought I always wanted!

14
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:07,609
I do like
    when you have a regimen.

15
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:09,169
Oh.

16
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:11,671
I can feel myself getting hotter
      than the other moms.

17
00:01:11,673 --> 00:01:14,366
And my husband can increase
   the incline from the app.

18
00:01:16,787 --> 00:01:18,862
(cackling)

19
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:20,956
I've never been happier.

20
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:23,350
I'm back
   to my sixth-grade weight!

21
00:01:23,352 --> 00:01:25,127
ANNOUNCER: Pedalon.
    Because a great marriage

22
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:27,036
is a bike that goes nowhere.

23
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:29,706
-(grunting)
    -(grunting) Why, you...

24
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,374
You know, Homie,

25
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:34,785
an exercise bike would be good
       for someone like me

26
00:01:34,787 --> 00:01:36,454
who can barely leave the house.

27
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:38,623
And my birthday's coming up.

28
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,050
An exercise bike?
    Why would you want that,

29
00:01:41,052 --> 00:01:43,294
instead of getting
  locked into a gym membership

30
00:01:43,296 --> 00:01:45,205
you could never use
        and can't cancel?

31
00:01:45,207 --> 00:01:46,873
Oh, never mind.

32
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,893
Just once I'd like
    to get something I want.

33
00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:51,486
(cries)

34
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:57,975
I'll get her the damn bike

35
00:01:57,977 --> 00:02:00,203
and anything else the TV says.

36
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:01,905
(shrieks)

37
00:02:01,907 --> 00:02:04,557
(shrieks) Why, you...

38
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:07,085
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
            (grunts)

39
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,154
One wife bike, please.

40
00:02:10,156 --> 00:02:11,489
Excellent choice, sir.

41
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:14,083
Our starter model
       goes for $1,500.

42
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:16,403
$1,500?!

43
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:19,088
Don't worry.
We do have an installment plan.

44
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,740
$40 a month for...

45
00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:22,392
(mumbles) ...months.

46
00:02:23,595 --> 00:02:25,020
That's better.

47
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:26,504
And at 60 bucks
       for the classes...

48
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:28,857
-What the...?
    -...25 for the matching
        water bottle...

49
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:32,176
-That's crazy.
        -...and it's 125
     for the special shoes.

50
00:02:32,178 --> 00:02:34,103
Fine, I'll take the shoes.

51
00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:35,104
Good choice.

52
00:02:35,106 --> 00:02:37,032
Regular laces or deluxe?

53
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:39,034
-Regular.
    -The regular cost more.

54
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:40,260
(groans)

55
00:02:40,262 --> 00:02:41,703
(snoring)

56
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:43,705
("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"
  from The Nutcracker playing)

57
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:45,932
(giggles)

58
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:49,860
And now for the birthday elf
    to work his silent magic.

59
00:02:49,862 --> 00:02:51,287
(yelling)

60
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:53,940
(grunting, yelling)

61
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:55,050
(clanks)

62
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:57,135
(classical music playing)

63
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:02,206
(grunts) Why did I say
   "I'll take it from here"?

64
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,784
Why do I always want to impress?

65
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:05,969
I got it from here, guys.

66
00:03:05,971 --> 00:03:07,562
(cracking)

67
00:03:08,457 --> 00:03:10,899
No. I'll take me from here.

68
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:13,126
(loud groaning)

69
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:15,403
(pained grunting)

70
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:17,480
Oh, God!

71
00:03:17,482 --> 00:03:20,075
Assembling your bike
       couldn't be easier.

72
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:23,803
Step one, get your 10,000 SPM
       pneumatic jigsaw.

73
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:24,821
My what?

74
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:26,806
Difficult. Complicated.

75
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,141
Obscenely hard.

76
00:03:28,143 --> 00:03:29,476
Congratulations.

77
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:30,827
You've opened the box.

78
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,254
Now, we begin.

79
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:34,756
(ratcheting)

80
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:38,426
Son, I'm trapped.

81
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,504
(whistling)

82
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:42,672
(grunting)

83
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:46,685
There must be a way
    to get out of this gift!

84
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,229
(clanging)

85
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,149
Love you, Dad. Mwah.

86
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:57,504
(Homer groans)

87
00:03:57,506 --> 00:03:58,780
(ratcheting)

88
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:00,690
Surprise!

89
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:02,266
(grunting)

90
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:04,435
It's wonderful, Homie!

91
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:08,039
And there's one thing left
            I can do.

92
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:11,209
(clanging)

93
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:13,036
I'll fix that.

94
00:04:13,038 --> 00:04:14,629
Just stop.

95
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:16,631
(strained grunting)

96
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:20,468
Okay.

97
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,471
"Step one,
   create a unique username."

98
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:31,646
Ooh, now, he looks like fun.

99
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,208
What's up, Pedalon family?

100
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,468
My name is Jesse,
     and I care about you.

101
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,213
All of you. Except for the woman
       on the bottom left.

102
00:04:40,215 --> 00:04:42,048
Your credit card was declined.

103
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,534
Repo men are on the way!

104
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,120
No...!

105
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:50,290
Now let's ride.

106
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:54,911
(pants, sniffs)

107
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:56,746
(panting)

108
00:04:56,748 --> 00:04:58,340
Oh, boy.

109
00:04:58,342 --> 00:05:00,342
You got this, ScaredToGoToGym!

110
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:02,510
Way to be, EndorphinAnnie!

111
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:04,737
And that is the end!

112
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:07,515
Of warm-up. Let's look alive!

113
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:14,430
(groans)
           I can't.

114
00:05:14,432 --> 00:05:15,932
I can't do it.

115
00:05:16,935 --> 00:05:19,009
Don't you give up,
        MrsMargeSimpson!

116
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:21,771
You're talking to me.

117
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:23,272
Yes, I am, MrsMargeSimpson,

118
00:05:23,274 --> 00:05:25,700
and I believe in you!

119
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:28,703
Oh, my God.
 A positive online interaction.

120
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:30,205
Can you believe it, Alexa?

121
00:05:30,207 --> 00:05:32,448
ALEXA:
        I'm on my break.

122
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,282
(humming)

123
00:05:33,284 --> 00:05:36,193
And cross that finish line.

124
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:38,046
To quote
    a personal hero of mine,

125
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:39,455
Mr. Nelson Mandela,

126
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:42,458
it always seems impossible
        until it is done.

127
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,945
I prefer to believe that he
was talking about riding a bike

128
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:47,130
in your living room.

129
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:49,057
Peace out!

130
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:51,968
Is something wrong, Mom?

131
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,104
You didn't get the mail today.

132
00:05:58,568 --> 00:05:59,459
What's this?

133
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:01,069
Lisa, I'm in cool-down mode.

134
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:02,070
Can it wait?

135
00:06:02,072 --> 00:06:04,130
I don't want jelly legs.

136
00:06:04,132 --> 00:06:07,075
Mmm. Jelly legs.

137
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,805
(chewing)

138
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:14,140
It's a jury summons,

139
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:15,733
in my name!

140
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:17,977
Ignore it. When you're my age,

141
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:21,497
the last thing you want to do
    is stay still in a box.

142
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:25,093
Yeah, I mean, obviously,
 it's for another Lisa Simpson.

143
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:27,837
(gasps)
  It says if I throw it away,

144
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,265
there's six months in prison!

145
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:33,601
Um, is that vegan?

146
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:35,178
Vegan? No way.

147
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,938
This is prison.

148
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,348
It's vegetarian.

149
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,359
(laughter)

150
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,281
Honey, you got the triple "H"!

151
00:06:46,283 --> 00:06:48,116
Homer, home and hungry!

152
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:50,693
Can't talk now.
  Jesse is freestyle rapping.

153
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,939
It's only the first inning,
 heart beating, no retreating

154
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:56,532
Time, it is fleeting

155
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:57,292
When are we eating?

156
00:06:57,294 --> 00:06:59,352
6:00 p.m. No cheating!

157
00:06:59,354 --> 00:07:02,279
I'm Hamilton on a bike,
  Hamilton on a bike, y'all

158
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:05,541
You drop the LBs
 while I drop the mic, y'all!

159
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:07,260
(chuckles):
             Yeah!

160
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:10,788
Oh...

161
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,699
-(grumbling)
            -(chime)

162
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:14,476
Ooh, a high four!

163
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:16,811
Marge, sweetie,
  what does that bike give you

164
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:18,554
that feeding me doesn't?

165
00:07:18,556 --> 00:07:20,540
Encouragement.

166
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:22,633
(chiming)

167
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:23,893
MrsMargeSimpson,

168
00:07:23,895 --> 00:07:26,562
that is one beauteous gluteus!

169
00:07:27,716 --> 00:07:30,533
HOMER:
    I'll put a stop to this
         here and now.

170
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:34,162
Backup battery activated!

171
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:37,073
And Marge Simpson
    is my biker of the week.

172
00:07:37,075 --> 00:07:39,575
(groans)
        Stupid Peloton!

173
00:07:39,577 --> 00:07:40,835
I mean, Pedalon!

174
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:42,420
Uh, you know what I mean!

175
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:49,135
(grunting)
              Ah...

176
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:52,922
MrsMargeSimpson,
    we're gonna play "Taps"

177
00:07:52,924 --> 00:07:54,924
because you killed it today.

178
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:57,093
("Taps" playing)

179
00:07:57,095 --> 00:07:58,353
And riding to "Taps."

180
00:07:58,355 --> 00:08:00,671
And a one, and a two,
           and a go!

181
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:03,599
Marge, you've been sitting
     on that thing all day.

182
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:06,010
-(Marge grunting)
  -Why don't you take a walk?

183
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:07,420
Get a little exercise.

184
00:08:07,422 --> 00:08:09,847
Wait a minute,
       "Marge in Charge"?

185
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:11,699
What happened to
       Mrs. Marge Simpson?

186
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:14,610
I'm just getting tired of
     the same old things.

187
00:08:14,612 --> 00:08:16,204
Like my last name?

188
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:18,373
That was my gift to you
        at our wedding.

189
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,951
It's just a user name.
      You're overreacting.

190
00:08:21,953 --> 00:08:23,044
-Oh, am I?
       -(Marge grunting)

191
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:25,195
Am I overreacting to my wife

192
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:27,456
being taken in by a cult?

193
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,126
It's not a cult.
  It's just a group of people

194
00:08:30,128 --> 00:08:32,036
improving their lives,
          paying money,

195
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:35,098
and slavishly following
     a charismatic leader.

196
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:39,769
Ah. Boy, do I love
    drinking that Kool-Aid.

197
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,568
(barks softly)

198
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:54,892
Um, excuse me,
    there's been a mistake.

199
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:56,986
(chuckles)
       Yeah, that's what
         they all say.

200
00:08:56,988 --> 00:09:00,323
No, really.
   I should not be on a jury.

201
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:02,658
Well, no one wants
        to be on a jury.

202
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,660
But I have a valid excuse.
             I'm...

203
00:09:04,662 --> 00:09:06,236
Ugh, I'm so sick of this.

204
00:09:06,238 --> 00:09:08,256
People say their work
       is too important,

205
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:10,074
or they have a vacation planned,

206
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:12,335
or they hate cops,
       or they love cops,

207
00:09:12,337 --> 00:09:14,837
or they're secretly
        eight years old.

208
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:16,989
But I am only eight years old.

209
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,433
Just ignore that magazine,

210
00:09:18,435 --> 00:09:20,584
and please take a good look
            at me.

211
00:09:20,586 --> 00:09:23,605
What eight-year-old
          wears pearls?

212
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:27,275
You're being non-responsive
    and borderline fascist.

213
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:29,593
So you claim
    you're eight years old,

214
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:32,021
and you're using language
          like that?

215
00:09:32,023 --> 00:09:35,074
Excuse denied!
       Get out of my face.

216
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,369
(bedsprings squeaking loudly)

217
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:42,624
-(Marge grunting)
        -(Homer groans)

218
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:47,069
-One, two, one, two, one...
     -Marge, Marge. Marge!

219
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:50,022
-Ah!
       -You were pedaling
         in your sleep.

220
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:51,357
Good. Good.

221
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,784
Jesse says the only bad workout
          is the one

222
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:54,952
that doesn't happen.

223
00:09:54,954 --> 00:09:56,195
(gasps)

224
00:09:56,197 --> 00:09:59,048
You brought Jesse
       into our bedroom.

225
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,125
Oh, sweetie, don't worry.

226
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:03,144
Yes, I may dream about him,

227
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:05,054
spend most of my day
            with him,

228
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:08,724
use up half our
   disposable income on him.

229
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:11,301
But I'm married to you, Jesse.

230
00:10:11,303 --> 00:10:13,971
Homer! Homer, Homer.
     I'm married to Homer.

231
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:16,640
Now, let's get to Jesse.
          Sleep. Sleep.

232
00:10:16,642 --> 00:10:19,702
Homer. Oh... Mmm.

233
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:20,995
Okay.

234
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:22,830
What is that?

235
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:26,668
Uh, it's a Pedalon
          pillow scent.

236
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,670
What's it called?

237
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:32,715
Um, "Sweat Dreams, by Jesse."

238
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,571
Fine. I'm going to Moe's.

239
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:41,240
Where the only exercise you get
       is lifting a mug.

240
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:43,333
Sometimes Moe helps
         with that, too.

241
00:10:43,335 --> 00:10:46,837
That's my big boy.
     Only five more to go.

242
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:48,839
That's my little drinker.

243
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:49,916
Aww.

244
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:52,176
Homer, what gives?
       It's only Tuesday,

245
00:10:52,178 --> 00:10:54,086
and you're drinking
     like it's a Thursday.

246
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:55,771
I got nothing
      to go home to except

247
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:57,990
except my incredibly fit wife.

248
00:10:59,277 --> 00:11:01,852
I think she has a thing
    for her ride instructor.

249
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:02,945
Eh, don't worry.

250
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:04,822
Those guys are losers
         in real life.

251
00:11:04,824 --> 00:11:06,374
Let me check out what they make.

252
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:09,268
$500,000?

253
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,270
I wish I was a ride instructor.

254
00:11:11,272 --> 00:11:13,548
Yeah, me, too.
  Except for the bike riding,

255
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,274
and saying encouraging things.

256
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:17,626
And I'm not allowed
   to appear on the Internet

257
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:20,037
without a big dot
      in front of my face.

258
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,872
Wow, that is an improvement.

259
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:25,167
Sure is gonna be hard
  to go back to "No-Dot" Moe.

260
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:26,394
Just for that, I'll turn on

261
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:29,421
-the really harsh lighting.
         -Turn it off.

262
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:32,216
Why can't she be happy
  with the other instructors?

263
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:36,053
Like Vivica, or Jen S.
         Or even Jen R.?

264
00:11:36,055 --> 00:11:37,797
Why always Jesse?

265
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,574
Oh, did you say Jesse?

266
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:42,802
-Jesse of Pedalon?
       -You guys know him?

267
00:11:42,804 --> 00:11:44,561
He is a damnation.

268
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:47,064
Hey, you kiss your cross
        with that mouth?

269
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:48,657
I know what I said.

270
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:52,754
I could do laps in his
   deep blue eyes, that jerk.

271
00:11:52,756 --> 00:11:54,997
(grumbling)

272
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:56,499
Would you listen
         to yourselves?

273
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:59,093
Complaining that your wives
    found a healthy hobby.

274
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:02,805
I'm ashamed to be drinking till
 2:00 a.m. with all of youse.

275
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:07,101
All rise for juror selection.

276
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:11,272
LISA:
    She looks understanding.

277
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,109
Christmas gift.

278
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:16,852
Now, listen here.

279
00:12:16,854 --> 00:12:18,762
Jurors will only be released

280
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:20,506
for the most serious of reasons.

281
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:23,192
Tell you what,
   if you get me out of this,

282
00:12:23,194 --> 00:12:24,360
we could have coffee.

283
00:12:24,362 --> 00:12:26,362
Your Honor, we should
       both be excused.

284
00:12:26,364 --> 00:12:28,697
As a newsman
      who's seen too much,

285
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:30,899
I can't possibly be objective.

286
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:32,018
What about her?

287
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,462
-She's my plus-one.
              -Aww.

288
00:12:34,464 --> 00:12:38,541
Do you have any objections
   to losing these... jurors?

289
00:12:38,543 --> 00:12:41,552
Ah, well, they're
    the only jurors I like.

290
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:45,865
Oh, boy. Aw, geez.

291
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:47,183
Don't type that part.

292
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:48,868
And don't type the part
         where I said,

293
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,811
"Don't type that part."

294
00:12:49,813 --> 00:12:51,128
Ah, she's typing it.

295
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,222
You know, I think I'm gonna
        win this case.

296
00:12:53,224 --> 00:12:55,541
Oh, now she stops typing.

297
00:12:55,543 --> 00:12:58,069
Jurors six and eight
          are excused.

298
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:01,138
This place makes no sense.

299
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,156
You're telling me?

300
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:03,974
I'm on this jury while I am

301
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:06,327
simultaneously in prison.

302
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:09,572
Personal best, WineMomNoMore.

303
00:13:09,574 --> 00:13:12,741
Big deal,
  the instructor talks to you.

304
00:13:12,743 --> 00:13:14,151
Marge in Charge.

305
00:13:14,153 --> 00:13:16,987
(gasps)
That's me, that's me, that's me.

306
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:18,673
I'd like to see you
          after class.

307
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:19,841
Meet me in the...

308
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:21,584
Cool Down Lounge.

309
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:22,826
Hmm?

310
00:13:22,828 --> 00:13:24,828
Marge, I've been watching you,

311
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,072
and I would like to invite you

312
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:27,497
for a private ride.

313
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,504
A personal experience,
        you and me alone.

314
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:36,098
The world is our bike lane.

315
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,343
You mean the two of us
       in the same place?

316
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:40,528
Oh, no. God, no. No.

317
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,104
The same way
     we've always done it.

318
00:13:42,106 --> 00:13:43,606
You on your bike
         and me on mine.

319
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:46,092
My motives are pure. Ha.

320
00:13:46,094 --> 00:13:47,610
Well, Marge?

321
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:49,370
Just the two of us

322
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:52,206
We can make it if we try

323
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,208
This makes me feel
          a little odd,

324
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,043
but again,
      the only bad workout

325
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:57,620
is the one you don't do.

326
00:13:57,622 --> 00:13:59,105
JESSE:
       You got that right.

327
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:00,623
I thought I shut this off.

328
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,775
JESSE:
   Uh, there's a five minute
       "secret listen."

329
00:14:02,777 --> 00:14:04,534
Y-You have to opt out.

330
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,641
Here we go.

331
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:14,520
You've got something
         to say, say it.

332
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:17,315
Nap time.

333
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:27,149
And when you found the victim
        lying carved up

334
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:29,135
like a spiral-cut ham,

335
00:14:29,137 --> 00:14:30,578
You took this photo.

336
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,988
Yeah, but see how I got
         the full moon

337
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,974
reflecting in the pool of blood?

338
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:36,900
And that's just using
        the iPhone 10,

339
00:14:36,902 --> 00:14:38,920
not the good one.
       (chuckles) Amazing.

340
00:14:38,922 --> 00:14:40,570
Can you believe this?

341
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:43,407
Longest Judge Judy
         I've ever seen.

342
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:45,409
(scoffs)
     This is not a TV show,

343
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:47,762
and we are not
       a studio audience.

344
00:14:47,764 --> 00:14:51,581
And little jurors should be seen
         and not heard.

345
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,935
(whistling)

346
00:15:00,851 --> 00:15:02,318
(hums)

347
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:06,172
WOMAN'S VOICE:
  Welcome to the Private Ride.

348
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:09,266
-Just you and your instructor.
            -(beeps)

349
00:15:09,268 --> 00:15:11,768
We'll just send that
         to voice mail.

350
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,704
(exotic music playing)

351
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,516
(speaking Mandarin)

352
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:19,518
That means thank you
         for joining me.

353
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,945
Today our pedal odyssey will
           take us on

354
00:15:21,947 --> 00:15:23,780
the Great Wall of China.

355
00:15:23,782 --> 00:15:27,301
So sit back, enjoy, and...
        (speaks Mandarin)

356
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:29,804
That means
      remember to hydrate.

357
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:31,514
(exotic music continues)

358
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,868
Behold the wonders of China.

359
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,219
Bitcoin mines,

360
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:40,723
forced labor camps where
   children make smartphones,

361
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:43,375
and romance.

362
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:46,654
Marge, I know we've had
      a tough few weeks,

363
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:49,064
but I'm really gonna make
     an effort to be good

364
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:50,307
till you're not mad.

365
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:52,159
Then I'll go back
       to the way I was.

366
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,902
JESSE:
   That's it, feel the burn.

367
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:56,247
Feel you, feel me.

368
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:00,984
Let's take him down.

369
00:16:00,986 --> 00:16:02,561
You got to be more specific,
             Homer.

370
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:04,672
We hate lots of guys
          in this bar.

371
00:16:04,674 --> 00:16:07,157
I know who he means.
             Jesse.

372
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,492
If we did have sex,

373
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:10,736
my wife would be
        thinking of him.

374
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:13,572
And hypothetically,
         I'd be furious.

375
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:15,999
When that guy tried
         to steal Marge,

376
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:19,002
he woke the wrong
        sleeping fatso.

377
00:16:19,004 --> 00:16:21,263
I just have to find him.

378
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:23,098
I can tell you where he is.

379
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,191
What? How?

380
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:25,467
You know how the Church says

381
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:28,011
we don't share
        any information?

382
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:30,939
It's a lie. Google bought us
         six years ago,

383
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:33,350
so here you are.

384
00:16:33,352 --> 00:16:37,872
I'm gonna put a foot-shaped dent
      in his beautiful ass.

385
00:16:37,874 --> 00:16:40,023
Defense, closing statement.

386
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:42,025
Ladies and gentlemen
          of the jury,

387
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:43,878
consider everything you've seen,

388
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,954
and beyond a shadow of a doubt,

389
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:48,123
you will vote guilty.

390
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,033
You're the not guilty guy.

391
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:51,886
Uh, wha-what?

392
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:53,279
Gol-dang it.

393
00:16:53,281 --> 00:16:55,281
Now, if there are
    no further statements...

394
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:56,706
I have a statement.

395
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,208
This is highly irregular,

396
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,286
but I'm very bored,
        so I'll allow it.

397
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:02,897
Thank you. I didn't want
       to be on this jury.

398
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:04,381
I didn't think
       I was mature enough

399
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:06,049
to decide a criminal case.

400
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:09,295
But after seeing the nonsense
that goes on in this courtroom,

401
00:17:09,297 --> 00:17:11,630
well, you should be ashamed.

402
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:14,241
And, Your Honor,
       I find you guilty

403
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:17,469
of criminal indifference
       and playing Wordle

404
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:18,895
on the bench.

405
00:17:18,897 --> 00:17:21,490
"Bench."
       That's what it is.

406
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:23,992
Ah, juror number six.
         Lisa Simpson.

407
00:17:23,994 --> 00:17:25,252
Yes, Judge?

408
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:28,071
I find you in contempt
            of court.

409
00:17:28,073 --> 00:17:29,739
Bailiff, take her away.

410
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:32,576
Now the forewoman is gonna be
      the Crazy Cat Lady.

411
00:17:32,578 --> 00:17:33,910
(gibbering):
     I want to take a vote.

412
00:17:33,912 --> 00:17:35,262
No, too soon!
         Take a vote...

413
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:36,746
(spouting gibberish)

414
00:17:36,748 --> 00:17:39,391
Kitty's going to--
  What was it? Guilty, guilty.

415
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:44,105
And that leaves 11 jurors.
        It's a mistrial.

416
00:17:44,107 --> 00:17:45,773
The defendant can go free.

417
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:47,608
(Lisa groans)

418
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,276
(knock on Jesse's door)

419
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:51,019
Uh, excuse me, private riders,

420
00:17:51,021 --> 00:17:52,613
I have a guy at the door.

421
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:53,839
Yes, may I help you?

422
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:55,098
(Homer grunts)

423
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,327
(both grunting)

424
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:02,456
You like that?
     You like that, fatty?

425
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,184
Okay, so when strangling
        a man, don't just

426
00:18:05,186 --> 00:18:07,461
use your arms, people,
        engage that core.

427
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:09,964
Engage. Engage.

428
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:13,950
I'll die as I lived...

429
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:15,970
failing and sweaty.

430
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:18,305
Let him go.
          Let him go.

431
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,391
Oh, I've got to save Homie.

432
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,703
(engine not turning over)

433
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:26,355
Damn it!

434
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:34,046
Oh, it's so hard to ride
  without a screen to look at.

435
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:37,641
Muscle memory.
         Muscle memory.

436
00:18:44,408 --> 00:18:45,666
Cool.

437
00:18:54,418 --> 00:18:56,635
Whoa!

438
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:04,092
Aw, screw it.

439
00:19:04,094 --> 00:19:05,244
(groans)

440
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:07,671
Whoa, was that your mom?

441
00:19:07,673 --> 00:19:10,416
In a million years my mom
    would not be that cool.

442
00:19:10,418 --> 00:19:12,026
Bart, be home by 6:00.

443
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:14,052
Well, if it's not your mom,

444
00:19:14,054 --> 00:19:15,938
she stole her catchphrase.

445
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,240
(panting)

446
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:21,518
(gasping)

447
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,206
You're having a thing
         with my wife.

448
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,541
Dude, she doesn't even know
         where I live.

449
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,668
MARGE:
          You get away
        from my husband.

450
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:33,439
I thought you said
     it was a private ride.

451
00:19:33,441 --> 00:19:35,382
Well, you should have read
    the terms and conditions

452
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:37,384
before you checked "agree," huh?

453
00:19:38,054 --> 00:19:40,036
(Marge grunting)

454
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:42,281
That's enough, bub.

455
00:19:42,283 --> 00:19:45,208
That's it, Marge,
       work those quads.

456
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,636
I'm tired of men
     telling me what to do.

457
00:19:47,638 --> 00:19:49,897
(grunts)

458
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:52,608
(Jesse screaming)

459
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:58,722
Homer, let's go home.

460
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:00,223
Be sure to rate your ride,

461
00:20:00,225 --> 00:20:02,409
and use Jesse32
     for special discounts

462
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:03,819
in our online store.

463
00:20:03,821 --> 00:20:07,897
Not valid without any other
   discount codes. (groans)

464
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:10,751
Once again I have to thank you
          for saving me

465
00:20:10,753 --> 00:20:12,902
when I failed at saving you.

466
00:20:12,904 --> 00:20:16,315
BOTH:
      Just the two of us

467
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:18,408
We can make it if we try

468
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,261
Just the two of us

469
00:20:20,263 --> 00:20:23,338
Just the two
             of us

470
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,266
Just the two of us

471
00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:28,752
Building castles in the sky

472
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:30,771
Just the two of us

473
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:33,107
You and I.

474
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:37,503
Is that my bike?

475
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:40,172
HOMER AND MARGE:
      Just the two of us

476
00:20:40,174 --> 00:20:42,858
We can make it if we try

477
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,618
Just the two of us.

478
00:20:48,866 --> 00:20:51,107
I'm interested
       in buying a bike.

479
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:53,201
Well, you have come
       to the right place.

480
00:20:53,203 --> 00:20:55,111
I'll take it from here.

481
00:20:55,113 --> 00:20:58,281
(chuckles, sighs)
I used to make 500 grand a year.

482
00:20:58,283 --> 00:21:00,634
And I used to be king
       of South Jersey.

483
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:04,138
My big mistake was moving
    into Middlesex County.

484
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,308
Why did I get so cocky?
    Stupid, stupid, stupid!
