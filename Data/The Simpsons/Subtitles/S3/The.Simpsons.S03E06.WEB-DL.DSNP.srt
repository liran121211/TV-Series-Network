-Yeah, spill your guts, man.
-Yeah, yeah, come on.

181
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,851
Krusty, tell us.

182
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,060
Well, okay.

183
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,520
First of all,

184
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,897
my real name isn't
Krusty the Clown.

185
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,941
It's Herschel Krustofski.

186
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,734
My father was a rabbi.

187
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,571
His father was a rabbi.

188
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,114
His father's father--
Well, you get the idea.

189
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:31,367
<i>My father was</i>
<i>the most respected man</i>

190
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,244
<i>in the lower east side</i>
<i>of Springfield.</i>

191
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,455
<i>People would come</i>
<i>from miles around</i>

192
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,748
<i>to ask his advice.</i>

193
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,334
Reb Krustofski,
should I finish college?

194
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,754
Yes. No one is poor except
he who lacks knowledge.

195
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,965
Rabbi, should I have
another child?

196
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:49,093
Yes. Another child would be
a blessing on your house.

197
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,471
Rabbi, should I
buy a Chrysler?

198
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,349
Could you rephrase that
as an ethical question?

199
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,894
Um... is it right
to buy a Chrysler?

200
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,814
Yes-- for great is the car
with power steering

201
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:02,857
and Dyna-Flo suspension.

202
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,150
Papa?

203
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,402
When I grow up,
can I be a clown?

204
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,238
No! A clown is not respected
member of the community.

205
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,740
But I wanna make people laugh.

206
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,451
Herschel, life is not fun.
Life is serious.

207
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,287
Seltzer is for drinking,
not for spraying.

208
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,372
Pie is for noshing,
not for throwing.

209
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,665
-But, Papa--
-But nothing!

210
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,083
You'll do as I say

211
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,710
or you'll get
such a zetz

212
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,129
that you won't even know
what hit you.

213
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,298
<i>Dad wanted me to follow</i>
<i>in his footsteps,</i>

214
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,009
<i>but the pull of clowning</i>
<i>was too strong.</i>

215
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,721
<i>I got my first big laughs</i>
<i>at Yeshiva</i>

216
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,640
<i>impersonating my father.</i>

217
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,267
Blah, blah, blah... Moses!
Blah, blah, blah...

218
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,353
(laughing)

219
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,355
(children gasping)

220
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,273
(choking)

221
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,944
Boy, you don't have to follow
in my footsteps.

222
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,445
Don't worry.

223
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,613
I don't even like using
the bathroom after you.

224
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,990
Why, you little--!

225
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,325
Krusty,
please continue.

226
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,035
Okay.

227
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,746
<i>My father tried to extinguish</i>
<i>the comedy bug,</i>

228
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,456
<i>but it was no use.</i>

229
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,958
What are you doing
in that bathroom?

230
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,042
Go away.

231
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,210
Open the door this instant!

232
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,422
<i>-Oy, gevalt!</i>
-Close the door!

233
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,509
<i>Then came my big break.</i>

234
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,261
<i>A Talmudic conference</i>
<i>in the Catskills,</i>

235
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,720
<i>and I was the entertainment.</i>

236
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,722
(applause)

237
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,891
<i>But the Lord works</i>
<i>in mysterious ways.</i>

238
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,017
(oohs and ahhs)

239
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,310
(gasps)

240
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,771
Do you know that
my son, Herschel,

241
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,064
was first
in his Yeshiva class.

242
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,274
As a matter of fact,
he was voted

243
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,192
the most likely
to hear God.

244
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,403
Oh, go on, Hyman,
you're exaggerating again.

245
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,654
You're so proud of your son.

246
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,447
A rabbi would
never exaggerate.

247
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,741
A rabbi composes.
He creates thoughts.

248
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,868
He tells stories that
may never have happened,

249
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,370
but he does not exaggerate.

250
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,330
<i>My father would have</i>
<i>never suspected a thing</i>

251
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,166
<i>were it not for</i>
<i>one, rowdy rabbi.</i>

252
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,460
Hey, funny man!

253
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,170
No, no, no!

254
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,880
(crowd laughing)

255
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,009
Herschel?

256
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,885
Herschel,
<i>oy vey iz mir!</i>

257
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,430
You have brought shame
on our family.

258
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,599
If you were a musician
or a jazz singer

259
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,143
this I could forgive,
but this?

260
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,853
I never want
to see you again...

261
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,105
you-- you clown!

262
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,027
(sobbing)

263
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,404
I haven't seen
my father since.

264
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,114
That is so sad.

265
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,699
Krusty, do you think about
your father a lot?

266
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,618
All the time.

267
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,369
Except when I'm at the track.
Then it's all business.

268
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,960
KRUSTY: Oh, look...

269
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,796
Aww... hmm.

270
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,132
Oh, look at you, Bart.

271
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,468
Oh, isn't that fun!

272
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,054
Ooh, hey! Whoa!

273
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,139
Oh, Fourth of July.

274
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,225
I can't believe that little boy
in the pictures is you, Bart.

275
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,646
Yeah. I got a lot
of fond memories.

276
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,650
Well, look at the time.
Almost midnight.

277
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,401
Do you have any yearbooks?

278
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,986
No, that's it.
You've seen everything.

279
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,656
So, Milhouse, know any
"knock, knock" jokes?

280
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,657
(crying)

281
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,825
I want to go home.

282
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,953
Homer, maybe you better
take Milhouse home.

283
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,288
Gladly.

284
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,252
Wow! The Concert For Bangladesh.

285
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,632
BART: Good night, Krusty.

286
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,175
Sorry about
your Dad.

287
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,345
Don't worry about me--
I'm a survivor.

288
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,429
Hey, did I leave
my keys inside?

289
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,472

we need you to help
us find a rabbi.

331
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,497
Well, before you make
any rash decisions,

332
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,166
let me just remind you
that the church is changing

333
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,210
to meet the needs of
today's young Christians.

334
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,795
No, no.
We're not converting.

335
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,047
We just want to find
a Rabbi Krustofski.

336
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,590
Rabbi Krustofski.
Wh--

337
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,843
I do a radio call-in show
with him every Sunday night.

338
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,804
-Really?
-I didn't know that.

339
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,973
I mention it
in my sermon every week.

340
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,934
Oh, that radio show.

341
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,645

343
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,649
Well, why don't you have
a free T-shirt?

344
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,860
You'll be the coolest kids

345
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,487
We'll put them on later.

346
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,823
Now, can you give us
the rabbi's address?

347
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,199
Oh, sure thing.

00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,493

What can I do for you,
my young friend?

355
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,966
We came to talk to you
about your son.

356
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,301
I have no son!

357
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,471
Oh great, we came all this way,
and it's the wrong guy.

358
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,057
I didn't mean that
literally!

359
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,646

DEEJAY: And, in order to keep

361

we devote
Sunday night dead time

362
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,777
to public service shows

363
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,613
In that spirit, we bring you
Gabbin' About God,

364
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,491
sponsored by Ace Religious Supply,
where they say

365
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,243
"If we don't got it,
it ain't holy."

366
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,121
With us tonight, once again,
our very own three wise men,

367
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,248
Reverend Timothy Lovejoy,
Monsignor Kenneth Daly

368
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,083
and Rabbi
Hyman Krustofski.

369
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,711
-Good to see you again.
-Nice to see you.

370
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,672
Okay, our first caller
is from Shelbyville Heights.

371
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,258
MAN: <i>Yes, hi. With all the</i>
<i>suffering and injustice in the world,</i>

372
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,677
<i>do you ever wonder</i>
<i>if God really exists?</i>

373
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,720
-No.
-Not for a second.

374
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,054
Not at all.

375
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,140
Great.
Good conversation there.

376
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,392
Our next call now is
for the good rabbi.

377
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,852
Hello?

378
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,395
-(heavy breathing)
-Anybody there?

379
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,938
I hear breathing,
but I don't hear talking.

380
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,316
What's going on here?
Hello, mister? Hello? Hello?

381
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,109
(heavy sighing)

382
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,487
Some people got nothing to do
but call people and hang up.

383
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,656
There's all kinds of
mishagoyim in the world.

384
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,325
Okay, let's clear the board.
Our next caller is

385
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,035
a young boy from
right here in Springfield.

386
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,786
BART:
<i>Hello. My name is Dmitri.</i>

387
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,830
<i>I'm a first-time caller,</i>
<i>long-time listener.</i>

388
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,498
My question is...

389
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,126
if a son defies his father
and chooses a career

390
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,128
that makes millions
of children happy,

391
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,380
<i>shouldn't the father</i>
<i>forgive the son?</i>

392
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,840
-I think so.
-Yes, of course.

393
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,343
No way! Absolutely not!
Never, never!

394
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,970
Who screens these calls? Who's
in charge here? There's nobody in charge?

395
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,722
<i>They leave a building</i>
<i>without people watching it? And anybody--</i>

396
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:35,184
Don't worry, Lis,
I got a plan that can't fail.

397
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,229
Yiddle, my man,
you're a genius.

398
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,899
I love my work.

399
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:46,862
Oh, the best charity is to give
and not let other people know.

400
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,783
But what if your example
encourages others to give?

401
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,201
MEN: Ahh.

402
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,119
Speaking of charity,
Rabbi Krustofski,

403
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,871
don't you think it's time
you forgave your son?

404
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,707
Don't you understand
that my boy broke my heart!

405
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,708
He turned his back
on our traditions,

406
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,877
on our faith, and on me.

407
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,088
Get out of here,
you little pisher.

408
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,881
Oy, this guy's tough.

409
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,633
Bart, we're gonna have to
outsmart him.

410
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,426
I don't know.
He's pretty sharp.

411
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,303
He saw right through
this disguise.

412
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,888
What? Saul Bellow?

413
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,848
The Nobel Prize-winning
Jewish novelist?

414
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,183
He wants to have
lunch with me?

415
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,268
Ha ha! It's a date.

416
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,562
Izzy's Deli, 1:00.
I'll be there.

417
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,981
The French government

418
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,233
wants to give me
the Legion of Honor?

419
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,860
Where do I receive
this prestigious award?

420
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:27,903
Izzy's Deli, 1:00.

421
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,239
Thank you, Monsieur President.

422
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,573
<i>Au revoir.</i>

423
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,621
Are you kids ready
to order yet?

424
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,081
Sorry, no.

425
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,958
Just get us another bowl
of complimentary pickles.

426
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,293
Watch how fast
I go.

427
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,837
And for you, sir?

428
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,589
I want a nice sandwich,
but the Joey Bishop--

429
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,550
Too fatty.

430
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,218
The Jackie Mason-- I don't know.
Sauerkraut makes me gassy.

431
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,803
The Bruce Willis?

432
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,138
I don't even
like his work.

433
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,015
What is this--
a Krusty the Clown?

434
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,559
Ham, sausage and bacon,
with a smidge of mayo.

435
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,102
-What?
-On white bread.

436
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,312
Listen! You tell
Mr. Saul Bellow

437
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,480
the Nobel Prize-winning
Jewish novelist

438
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,065
that I lost my appetite.

439
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,821
(Krusty humming
"The Marseilles")

440
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:14,241
Could you direct me to President
Francois Mitterand's table?

441
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,035
You think you're funny?

442
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,412
50 million Frenchmen
can't be wrong.

443
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,997
(groans)

444
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,374
Bart, we've been going
about this all wrong.

445
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:26,045
What's the one thing rabbis
prize above everything else?

446
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,629
Those stupid hats?

447
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,049
No, Bart-- knowledge.

448
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,051
LISA: We're gonna hit him
where it hurts--

449
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,719
right in the Judaica.

450
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,643
(imitates thunder)

451
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,936
Glub, glub, glub.

452
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,189
"Oh, Noah, Noah,
save us, save us!"

453
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,231
"No!"

454
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,650
This looks good, Bart.

455
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,277
Take it to him.

456
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,987
You I told to go away.

457
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,906
But-- But Rabbi, does it not say
in the Babylonian Talmud,

458
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,365
and I quote:

459
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,659
"A child should be pushed aside
with the left hand

460
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,995
and drawn closer
with the right."?

461
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,413
Yes.

462
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,706
Then doesn't your
religion command you

463
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,833
to make up with Krusty?

464
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,086
But in Exodus,
the Fifth Commandment says,

465
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,505
"Honor thy father
and thy mother."

466
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,589
End of story.

467
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,718
-Oh, it's hopeless.
-Not quite.

468
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,806
I got some dynamite stuff
from Rabbi Simon Ben-Eliazar.

469
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,518
"At all times let a man
be supple as a reed

470
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,187
and not rigid
as a cedar."

471
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,941
Bart, my short, learned friend,
the Book of Joshua says,

472
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:32,945
"You shall meditate on the Torah
all day and all night."

473
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,322
(murmured approval)

474
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,282
(yawning)

475
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,450
Hmm...

476
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,538
Is it not written
in the Talmud,

477
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,540
"Who will bring
redemption?

478
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,041
The jesters."

479
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,709
Sorry my friend,
I'm still not convinced,

480
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,670
and this is hardly the time
or place to discuss it.

481
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,216
Here you go, Bart.

482
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,260
It's a long shot,
but that's all I can do

483
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,470
without learning
ancient Hebrew.

484
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,767
Bart, I am not gonna learn
ancient Hebrew.

485
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,771
Rabbi, did not
a great man say,

486
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,275
and I quote, "The Jews are
a swinging bunch of people.

487
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,277
"I mean, I've heard
of persecution

488
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,445
"but what they went through
is ridiculous.

489
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,407
"But the great thing is
after thousands of years

490
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,159
"of waiting and
holding on and fighting,

491
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,660
they finally made it."

492
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,120
End quote.

493
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,289
Oh, I never heard
the plight of my people

494
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,040
phrased so eloquently.

495
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,333
Who said that?
Rabbi Hillel?

496
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,376
-Nope.
-Judah the Pious?

497
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,419
-Nope.
-Maimonides?

498
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,879
-Nope
-Ooh, I got it!

499
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:35,340
-The Dead Sea Scrolls!
-I'm afraid not, Rabbi.

500
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,259
It's from "Yes, I Can,"
by Sammy Davis, Jr.

501
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,095
An entertainer,
like your son.

502
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,097
(gasps)
The Candy Man?

503
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,099
If a performer can
think that way,

504
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,226
maybe I'm completely upside
down on this whole problem.

505
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,188
All the years of joy
that I've lost.

506
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,190
Why? Because of
my stubborn ways.

507
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,733
(crying)

508
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,568
There, there, Rabbi.

509
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,778
It's not too late.

510
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,199
(grunting)

511
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,494
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

512
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,205
Hi, kids.

513
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,582
Today's show's gonna be

514
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:12,085
the funniest, side-splittingest
cavalcade of...

515
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,587
Aw, the hell with it.

516
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,130
Roll the cartoon.

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,935
Hey, such
a filthy habit.

523
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,562
