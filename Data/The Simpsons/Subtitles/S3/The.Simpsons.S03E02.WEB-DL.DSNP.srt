(shuddering)

19
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,411
Mr. Simpson,
I can assure you.

20
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,412
This check of yours
is non-negotiable.

21
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,747
Oh, yeah?

22
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,041
Well, what makes you
so damn sure?

23
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,085
You see where it says
"Void, void, void,"

24
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,628

25
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,880
Cash value 1/20th of a cent.
Mr. Banker, do not honor."

26
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,381
Shut up.

27
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:34,302
I had a feeling
it was too good to be true.

28
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,054
Every time you get
$1 million

29
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,764
something queers
the deal.

30
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,100
I don't think real checks
have exclamation points.

31
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,811
Well, at least we got a free
sample of "Reading Digest."

32
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,938
Marge, I never read a
magazine in my life

33
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,273
and I'm not gonna start now.

34
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,775
Hey, a cartoon!

35
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:49,943
(Homer reading)

36
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,489
(laughs)
Ain't it the truth?

37
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,865
No, it's not
the truth, Homer.

38
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,742
It's well-documented

39
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,869
that women are
safer drivers than men.

40
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,580
Oh, Marge, cartoons don't have
any deep meaning.

41
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,998
They're just stupid drawings

42
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,250
that give you
a cheap laugh.

43
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,087
Hey Einstein,

44
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,839
put down your reading,
it's lunch time.

45
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,841
-Nah, you go ahead.
-You don't wanna eat?

46
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,509
What did you do?
Get one of them stomach staples?

47
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,970
As Tolstoy said
in Quotable Notables,

48
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,555
"Give me learning, sir,

49
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,598

your black bread."

50
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,808
Who is that bookworm,
Smithers?

51
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,017
Homer Simpson, sir.

52
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,728
Simpson, eh?
How very strange.

53
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,107
His job description clearly
specifies an illiterate.

54
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,693

Marge, look at them staring
at that idiot box.

59
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,244
God forbid they would
ever read something

60
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,745
and improve their minds.

61
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,707
You've certainly taken a shine
to that magazine.

62
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,584
It's not just
one magazine, Marge,

63
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,587
they take hundreds of magazines,
filter out the crap

64
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,755
and leave you with something

65
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,508
that fits right
in your front pocket.

66
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,051

69
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,643
Hey, what gives, man?

70
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,228
We're all gonna sit down
as a family

71
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,982
and listen to an inspiring story
of wilderness survival.

72
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,026
"Then I heard the sound

73
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,695
"that all arctic explorers
dread--

74
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,364

75
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,158
He'll be killed!

76
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:24,078
Homer, he obviously got out
alive if he wrote the article.

77
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,122
Don't be so--

78
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,707
Oh, you're right.

79
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,005
Homie, put down

80
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,590
your magazine
for a minute.

81
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,008

82
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,885
Mmm, I thought
you might want to snuggle.

83
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,803

Marge, "You have a nice body

00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,521
"and if you'd like to
see me in a costume,

87
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,981
you have only to ask."

88
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,524
Thank you, Homie.

89
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,778
Wow! Little meat loaf men!

90
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,198
Where did you get
the idea for this, Mom?

91
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,658
Where do you think?

92
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,618

94

enriched our lives.

00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,039

102
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,093
an essay contest.

104

fiercely pro-American.

105
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,848
Sounds interesting.

106
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,601
Bart, maybe this is something
you'd like to do too.

107
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,228
Mom, it's a nice thought

108
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,106
but we both know that
this is the pony to bet on.

109
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:39,529
What would Ben Franklin say
if he were alive today?

110
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,198
He'd say, uh...

111
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,616
think of a better opening.

112
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,951
How's it going, honey?

113
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,244
Not very well.

114
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,121
Well, when I used to get
stuck like this,

115
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,497
I'd go for a bike ride.

116
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,541
Do kids go
on bike rides anymore?

117
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,792
Yes!

118
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,043
I don't know.
I thought maybe bikes

119
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,421
weren't cool anymore.

120
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,382
Do kids still use
that word? "Cool?"

121
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,550
Yes, Mom!

122
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,936
Okay, America, inspire me.

123
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,941
Wow, a bald eagle.

124
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,280
Hmm...

125
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,824

I wouldn't do

in anything?

00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,743
-Mm. Mm.
-Hmm.

183
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,623
Lisa, after meeting
your father,

184
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,877
I've decided to award you
an additional five points.

185
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,172
Congratulations. You and your family
are going to Washington.

186
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,674
Whoo-hoo!
Who would have guessed

187
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,801
reading and writing
would pay off?

188
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,976
(bell dinging)

189
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,644
Yes, sir, can I
get you something?

190
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,980
Playing cards,
note pad, aspirin,

191
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,815
sewing kit,
pilot's wing pin,

192
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,151
propeller-shaped swizzle stick,
sleeping mask,

193
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,944
and anything else
I've got coming to me.

194
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,112
I'll see what I can do.

195
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,989
Hm... hmph.

196
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,324
(laughing)

197
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,783
-Hmph.
-(laughing)

198
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,494
Steward!

199
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,413
Little boy, I bet you'd
like to visit the cockpit.

200
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,207
Ooh-ooh, baby!

201
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,752
And this control stick is like
the handlebars on your tricycle.

202
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,129
Now, would you like to see
where we hang our coats?

203
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,881
No, thank you, I'd rather
push this button.

204
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,132
No!

205
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,178
(screams)
We're all gonna die!

206
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:35,515
(all screaming)

207
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:40,186
Look, Marge, that guy has
the same last name we do.

208
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,270
Taxi!

209
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,691
Ooh, look, Homer,
the I.R.S.

210
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,443
Boo!

211
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,445
Oh, boo yourself.

212
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,489
MARGE:
Here we are, kids.

213
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,990
The Watergate!

214
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,330
(humming)

215
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,706
(soft chuckle)

216
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,085
Hey!

217
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,586
(laughing)

218
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,547
MARGE: Homer, look!

219
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,008
They give you a shower cap
and body gel

220
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,677
and bathrobes.

221
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,513
And a welcoming mint
on your pillow.

222
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,640
Wow, a shoe horn.

223
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,308
Just like in the movies.

224
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,813
Shoe goes on, shoe goes off,
shoe goes on, shoe goes off.

225
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,107
Shoe goes on,
shoe goes off.

226
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,650
Hey, I call first bedsies.

227
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,069
Bart, there's no such thing
as first bedsies.

228
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,612
You just made that up.

229
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,781
Well, okay, which one
do you want?

230
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,075
I... want...

231
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,076
that one.

232
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,287
Really? You want
that one?

233
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,997
It's all yours.
Whatever you say.

234
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,540
Why? What's wrong with it?

235
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,708
Nothing.

236
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,126
Have a good night's sleep, Lisa.

237
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,252
-No really. What?
-Nothing.

238
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,254
-What did you do to it?
-Nothing.

239
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,339
Mom!

240
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,799
(phone ringing)

241
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,303
D'oh!
Stupid welcoming mint!

242
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,013
Hello?

243
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,557
BART: <i>Good morning,</i>
<i>this is your wake-up call.</i>

244
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,059
Wake-up call?
It's 2:00 a.m.

245
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,437
<i>Sorry, fatso.</i>

246
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,148
(laughing)

247
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,524
HOMER: Free food?

248
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,153
Lisa, I'm Faith Crowley,

249
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,197
Patriotism Editor
of Reading Digest.

250
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,407
Ooh, I love your magazine.

251
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,200
My favorite section is

252
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,411
"How to Increase
Your Word Power."

253
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,956
That things is really,
really, really... good.

254
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,583
Well good.

255
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,586
Lisa, I'd like you to meet
some of the other finalists.

256
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,920
This is Trong Van Dinh
and Maria Dominguez.

257
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,547
-Hello.
-Hello.

258
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,633
FAITH: Maria is the National
Spelling Bee Champion.

259
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,010
and Trong has won both

260
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,553
the Westinghouse
Talent Search,

261
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,598
and the N.F.L. Punt,
Pass and Kick Competition.

262
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,225
Have either of you ever run
into any problems

263
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,602
because of your
superior ability?

264
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,187
-Mmm...
-Sure, I guess.

265
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,147
Oh, me too.

266
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,734
These are special
V.I.P. badges.

267
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,736
They'll get you into places
other tourists never see.

268
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,613
Miss, what does the "I"
stand for?

269
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,615
Important.

270
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,450
Ooh... How about the "V"?

271
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,701
Very.

272
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,620
Oh... and miss?
Just one more question.

273
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,164
-Person.
-Ahh....

274
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,499
What does the "I"
stand for again?

275
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,500
Oh!

276
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,424
"On this spot, Richard Nixon
bowled back-to-back 300 games."

277
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,301
Yeah, right.

278
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,930
Wow, the President's bathroom.

279
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,143
(gasps)
Do you mind?

280
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,145
Barbara Bush!

281
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,398
Oh, you have
those damn badges.

282
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,857
Okay.

283
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,027
This tub was installed
in 1894...

284
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:39,115
Mmm... money.

285
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,742
Ahhh.

286
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,786
Hey, watch it, Chief.

287
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,540
Folks, we print more than
18 million bills a day.

288
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,667
Oh, and in case
you were wondering,

289
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,919
no, we don't give out
free samples.

290
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,963
(laughing)

291
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,673
Lousy, cheap country.

292
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:01,887
(imitating a machine gun)

293
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,349
Bart, get out of
the Spirit of St. Louis!

294
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,268
(imitating airplane engine)

295
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,978
(chuckling)

296
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,105
Hey, what's so funny?

297
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,982
(whispers)

298
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,692
Oh, Marge, grow up!

299
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:19,947
MAN: Congressman, this is
Springfield National Forest.

300
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,241
Now, basically, what we
want to do is cut her down.

301
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,618
-Uh-huh.
-As you can see in our artist's rendition,

302
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,872
it's full of old growth,
just aging and festering away.

303
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:31,709
In comes our logging company
to thin out the clutter.

304
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,461
It's all part of nature's,
you know, cycle.

305
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,963
Well, Jerry, you're
a whale of a lobbyist

306
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,007
and I'd like to give you
a logging permit, I would,

307
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,885
but, uh, this isn't
like burying toxic waste.

308
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,304
People are gonna notice
those trees are gone.

309
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,891
Congressman, this is where
it gets awkward.

310
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,102
I-- I never quite know
how to put this.

311
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,229
I just want to--

312
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,355
Offer me a bribe?

313
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,693
-(laughing)
-(intercom buzzing)

314
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,445
(sighs)
What is it?

315
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,447
<i>WOMAN: It's that little girl</i>
<i>from Springfield</i>

316
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,407
<i>who wrote the essay.</i>
<i>Could be a good photo-op.</i>

317
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,117
Uh, sure, fine.

318
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,702
So where do we--

319
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,579
Not here. I've got a
little place that I use

320
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,706
for these,
uh... matters.

321
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,166
Call me tonight.

322
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,919
Well, hi there.
You must be Lisa Simpson.

323
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,128
Hello, sir.

324
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,214
Lisa, you're a doer.
And who knows?

325
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,133
Maybe someday you'll be
a congressman or a senator.

326
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,968
We have quite a few
women senators, you know.

327
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,678
Only two. I checked.

328
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,639
(chuckling)
You're a sharp one.

329
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,557
Well, how about
a few pictures?

330
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,646
Tot shot always plays
in the sticks.

331
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,524
Oh, isn't that nice?

332
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,151
Now there is a politician
who cares.

333
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,195
If I ever vote,
it will be for him.

334
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,238
(burping)

335
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,452
Mom?

336
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,956
(groans)
Lisa, the contest isn't for three hours.

337
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,541
I'm too excited
to sleep.

338
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,751
Anyone up for the Winifred
Beecher Howe Memorial?

339
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,211
Who's that?

340
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,963
An early crusader
for women's rights.

341
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,882
She led the Floor Mop
Rebellion of 1910.

342
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,968
Later she appeared on
the highly unpopular

343
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,052
75-cent piece.

344
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,595
(groans)

345
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,265
Okay, but you don't know
what you're missing.

346
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,894
Oh.

347
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,399
"I will iron your sheets
when you iron out

348
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,276
the inequities
in your labor laws."

349
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,610
Amen, sister.

350
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,613
I told you
no one ever came here.

351
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,826
(chuckles) So Bob, where do we
stand on Springfield Forest?

352
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,662
Do I get
my logging permit?

353
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,622
Let me put it
this way, Jerry.

354
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,666
Timber!

355
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,334
(both laughing)

356
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,630
Whoo!
What a pooch.

357
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,048
Woof-woof!

358
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,051
(sobbing)

359
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,523
How could I read my essay now?

360
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,483
I don't believe my own words.

361
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,114
LISA: Honest Abe--

362
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,365
he'll show me the way.

363
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,289
Mr. Lincoln--

364
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,874
MAN: Mr. Lincoln,
I need your advice.

365
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,084
What can I do to make this
a better country?

366
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,711
Is this a good time
to buy a house?

367
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,463
I can't get my boy
to brush properly.

368
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,006
Would I look good
with a moustache?

369
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,302
I tried using turpentine,
but that just made it worse.

370
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,888
(indistinct chatter)

371
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,306
(shouting)
Mr. Lincoln

372
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:36,226
My name is Lisa Simpson,
and I have a problem!

373
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,482
Mr. Jefferson,
my name is Lisa Simpson

374
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,442
and I have a problem.

375
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,777
I know your problem.

376
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,695
The Lincoln Memorial
was too crowded.

377
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,280
Sorry, sir,
it's just--

378
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,074
No one ever comes to see me.

379
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,283
I don't blame them.

380
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,910
I never did anything important--

381
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,703
just The Declaration
of Independence,

382
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,289
the Louisiana Purchase,
the dumbwaiter--

383
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,708
Uh, maybe I should be going.
I caught you at a bad time.

384
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,751
Wait!

385
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,169
Please don't go.

386
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,254
I get so lonely.

387
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,967
(indistinct chatter)

388
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,223
(laughing)

389
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,319
The truth must be told.

390
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,075
(Bart moaning)

391
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,871
Rudy, my man,
you're a miracle worker.

392
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:38,998
Your laundry, sir.

393
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,792
There you go.

394
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,043
Buy yourself
something nice.

395
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,253
Thank you!

396
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,879
Bart, are you ready to go to--

397
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:46,922
(screams)

398
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,424
I'll room service you!

399
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,591
Before you kill me,
remember, this trip

400
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,510
is all expenses paid.

401
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:55,222

Oh, this guy is awful.

411
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,406
I know, honey,
but just sit still.

412
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:17,578
Welcome, everyone,
to the awards luncheon.

413
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,205
I'd like to introduce
our distinguished judges

414
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,666
who will select
our scholarship winner.

415
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,003
Former Redskins great,
Alonzo Flowers,

416
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:29,006
perennial third party candidate,
Wilson DeFarge,

417
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,258
senate page Brad Fletcher,

418
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:34,094
skin care consultant Rowena,

419
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,389
and wealthy gadabout
Chilton Gaines.

420
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,851
Our first essayist
will be Lisa Simpson.

421
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,311
Lisa?

422
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,229
Lisa?

423
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,649
(audience gasping)

424
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,026
Oh, there she is.

425
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,987
Lisa Simpson will now read
her essay...

426
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,032
I would like to read
a different essay, if I may?

427
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,242
Um... okay.

428
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,080
The city of Washington was built

429
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,083
on a stagnant swamp
some 200 years ago,

430
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,835
and very little has changed.

431
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,713
It stank then and it stinks now.

432
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,841
Only today, it is
the fetid stench of corruption

433
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,635
that hangs in the air.

434
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,637
Cool! A ruckus.

435
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,055
Hmm!

436
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,641
LISA:
...and who did I see

437
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,142
taking a bribe

438
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,561
but the "honorable" Bob Arnold.

439
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,687
(gasping)

440
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,231
But don't worry, Congressman.

441
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,900
I'm sure you can buy
all the votes you need

442
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,401
with your dirty money

443
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:35,239
and this will be one nation
under the dollar

444
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,659
with liberty
and justice for none.

445
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,577
(audience booing)

446
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,787
(gasping)

447
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,833
Senator, there's a problem at
the essay contest.

448
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,709
Please, son,
I'm very busy.

449
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,712
A little girl is
losing faith in democracy.

450
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,713
Good Lord!

451
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,804
Congressman,
we want to drill for oil

452
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,514
in Teddy Roosevelt's head.

453
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,349
Well...

454
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,059
Teddy who?

455
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,645
(laughing)
Congressman...

456
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,564
you're under arrest.

457
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,277
You work fast.

458
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,112
I work for Uncle Sam.

459
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:21,785
We will now vote
on the House Bill 1022--

460
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,996
The expulsion of Bob Arnold.

461
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,331
Mr. Speaker,
I'm all for the bill, but...

462
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,168
shouldn't we tack on
a pay raise for ourselves?

463
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,294
ALL: No!

464
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,342
Okay, this should make
my bosses very happy.

465
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,385
Your bosses?

466
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:42,264
Yep. All 250 million of them.

467
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,020
When my family arrived
in this country four months ago

468
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,064
we spoke no English and had
no money in our pockets.

469
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:55,068
Today, we own a nationwide chain
of wheel-balancing centers.

470
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,155
Where else but in America--
or possibly Canada--

471
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,657
could our family find
such opportunity?

472
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:04,161
That's why whenever I see
the stars and stripes,

473
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:08,332
I'll always be reminded of
that wonderful word, "flag."

474
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,625
(cheering)

475
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,126
There will be a brief recess

476
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,712
while the judges tabulate
their votes.

477
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,673
Lisa,
what's gotten into you?

478
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,176
Yeah, your other speech was
a little more crowd pleasing.

479
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,969
I'm sorry, Dad.

480
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,014
I couldn't think of a nice way
to say America stinks.

481
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:27,309
Extra! Extra!
Feds nab rotten rep!

482
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,186
Give me one of those.

483
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,188
MARGE:
"Imprisoned congressman

484
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,315
becomes
born-again Christian."

485
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,524
I can't believe it.

486
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,194
The system works.

487
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,820

490

He already sang this song.

491
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,578
No, that was about
the budget gap.

492
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,205
This is the trading gap.

493
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,915
(applause)

494
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,042
And now the moment of truth.

495
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,585
Will the winning essay be

496
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,630
"Bubble On, Oh, Melting Pot,"

497
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,633

498
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,886
"U.S.A. A-Okay,"

499
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,389
or "Cesspool on the Potomac"?

500
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,640
Cesspool! Cesspool!

501

Cesspool! Cesspool! Cesspool!

502
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,811
And now the winner is...

503
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,396
"U.S.A. A-Okay"

504
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,231
by Trong Van Dinh.

505
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,190
D'oh!

506
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,029

particularly
the courageous Lisa Simpson

511
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,290
whose inflammatory
rhetoric reminded us

512
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,835
that the price of freedom
is eternal vigilance.

513
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:35,919
Give her the check!

514
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,005
