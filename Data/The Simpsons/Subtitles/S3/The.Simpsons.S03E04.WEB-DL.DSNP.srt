26
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,550
No one wants your stupid
police badge, Bart.

27
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,010

28
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,137

00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,873

-and you know what that means.

55
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,460
That's right!
It's time for our field trip

56
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,421
to the chocolate factory.

57
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,090
I trust that you all remembered
to bring your permission slips?

58
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:59,345
Aah!

59
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,055
Ugh!

LISA: I'm going to eat
eight pieces of chocolate.

62
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,313
I'm gonna eat chocolate
till I barf.

63
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,857
(chuckling)
Don't worry, Bart.

64
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,193
We'll find something fun
for you to do.

65
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,570
Ah, here we are.
Here's a whole box of unsealed envelopes

66
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,113
for the P.T.A.

67
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,740
You're making me lick envelopes?

68
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,575
Oh, licking envelopes
can be fun.

69
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,160
All you have to do is
make a game of it.

70
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,037
What kind of game?

71
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,122
Well, for example, you can see
how many you can lick in an hour.

72
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,208
Then try to break
that record.

73
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,251
Sounds like a pretty crappy
game to me.

74
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,212
Yes, well, get started.

75
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:38,259

It's Cocoa Beanie himself.

78
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,391
I think this is something
Bart would really have enjoyed,

79
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,435
but it's the only way
he'll learn.

<i>instead of being wrapped</i>

<i>chocolate was wrapped</i>

<i>And instead of being</i>
<i>pure chocolate like we have today,</i>

91
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,089
<i>it was mixed</i>
<i>with shredded tobacco,</i>

92
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,591
<i>and they didn't eat it--</i>
<i>they smoked it.</i>

But don't you tell your teacher
I let you go home early.

While we are waiting, to see
how lucky you are, let me show you around.

00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,926
until one of us
is behind bars-- you.

182
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,803
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about a cigarette truck

183
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,097
that got hijacked on Route 401?

184
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,349
What's a truck?

185
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,100
Don't play dumb with me.

186
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,353
Relax, Chief.
You seem tense.

187
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,439
You know, the boy here makes
an excellent Manhattan.

188
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,316
Ah!

189
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,984
I'm still going
to put you away, ya' know.

190
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,486
Good for you.

191
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,863
♪♪ (humming tune)

192
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,783
(gasps) Bart!
Have you started smoking?

193
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,160
-No.
-Don't lie to me, boy.

194
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,370
Uh-huh! Cigarettes.

195
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,539
Just as I thought.

196
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,999
They're not mine.
My boss said his warehouse was full.

197
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,543
Yeah, right.

198
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,503
Son, I'm going
to teach you a lesson.

199
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,213
I'm going to stand here

200
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,758
and watch you smoke
every one of those cigarettes.

201
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,343
Then maybe you'll learn.

202
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,844
Fat Tony sent me over
to pick up the goods.

203
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,388
Right in here, my man.

204
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,515
Hey kid, you look good
with that cigarette--

205
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,392
kind of sophisticated.

206
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,686
Son, I'll never
doubt you again.

207
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,021
MAN (on TV): <i>The contents</i>
<i>of the hijacked truck--</i>

208
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,732

213
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,242
<i>there is no shortage</i>

214
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,953
<i>How do we know that?</i>

215
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,747
<i>Let me refer that back to Jack Larson</i>
<i>of Laramie Tobacco Products.</i>

216
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,083
<i>-Jack?</i>
<i>-Thank you, Chief.</i>

217
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,169
<i>Folks, I'm pleased to announce</i>

William "Fat Tony" Williams.

225
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:06,522
<i>Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city.</i>
<i>He is the cancer,</i>

226
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,357
<i>and I am the...</i>

227
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,151
<i>Uh, what cures cancer?</i>

228
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,821
-Bart, is your boss a crook?
-I don't think so,

229
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,073
although it would explain
an awful lot.

230
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,368
Me and the boys
wish to thank you

231
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,662
for hanging on to
this stuff for us.

232
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,830
Thanks.

233
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,540
Uh... say

234
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,208
are you guys crooks?

235
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:30,087
Bart, um... is it wrong
to steal a loaf of bread

236
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,423
-to feed your starving family?
-No.

237
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,425
Well, suppose you got
a large starving family.

238
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,261
Is it wrong to steal
a truckload of bread to feed them?

239
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:41,182
-Uh-uh.
-And what if your family don't like bread?

240
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,809
-They like cigarettes.
-I guess that's okay.

241
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,312
Now, what if instead
of giving them away

242
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,813
you sold them at a price

243
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,191
that was practically
giving them away?

244
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,276
Would that be a crime, Bart?

245
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,861
Hell, no.

246
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,321
Enjoy your gift.

247
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,825
Superb.

(grumbling)

254
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,468
I know it's good for a boy
to have a part-time job,

255
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,721
but I'm not sure about
the people Bart's working for.

256
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,349
-I think they're criminals.
-A job's a job.

257
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,977
I mean, take me. If my plant
pollutes the water and poisons the town,

258
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,939
by your logic,
that would make me a criminal.

259
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,108
Bart's been acting
very strangely.

260
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,276
And that pizza delivery truck

261
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,029
has been parked across
the street for two weeks.

262
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,532
<i>How long does it take</i>
<i>to deliver a pizza?</i>

263
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,866
Looks like our cover's blown.

264
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,951
Let's roll.

265
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,830
See? It was all
your imagination.

266
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,499
Homer, I want you to go
down to that club

267
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,042
and talk to them.

268
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,586
See what kind
of people they are.

269
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,588
Please, Homie.

270
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,465
Oh, all right.

271
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,177
Hmm.

272
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,554
(Homer chuckling )

273
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,472
Read 'em and weep, boys.

274
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,890
Another pair of sixes.

275
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,685
-Beats me.
-I was bluffing.

276
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,479
-You win again, Homer.
-(Homer chuckling)

277
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,314
I am thrilled you've decided
to let your boy

278
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,358
continue to work here.

279
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,735
Y'know, if you need a hat-check
girl, I've got a daughter.

280
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,404
Homer, you're
a hell of a father.

281
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,074
Homer! What did
you find out?

282
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,452
Marge, the only thing
going on down there

283
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,745
was a lot of
male bonding.

284
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,663
More stink lines, boys.

285
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,749
-(gasping)
-Hmm?

286
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,876
What's this?
What are you boys doing?

287
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,461
(yawns loudly)

288
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,671
You didn't see nothing.
Now, beat it.

289
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:46,891
So, Fat Tony, you invite
me and my associates to your club

290
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,643
with the promise of the finest
Manhattans in all of Springfield.

291
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,313
Now you say your bartender
isn't here?

292
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,690
I don't know what happened.
He's never late.

293
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,233
Louie, make up
some Manhattans.

294
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,194
But I only know how to make
wine spritzers.

295
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,278
Now!

296
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,993
(slurping)

297
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:11,165
What have I done to deserve
this flat, flavorless Manhattan?

298
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,671
Mmm...

299
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,841
Come on, boys.

300
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,928
The kiss of death.

301
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,012
That's all I need.

302
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,766
(grumbling)

303
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,643
...lousy Skinner.

304
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:34,772
-You are late for work.
-Of course I'm late for work!

305
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,650
How can I be on time when
Principal Skinner keeps me after school?

306
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,443
This guy Skinner is
causing you trouble?

307
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,070
He sure is, <i>patron.</i>

308
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,988
Hmm. Perhaps we should go

309
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,616
to meet and greet
this individual.

310
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,617
Come on, boys.

311
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,123
Some large men
to see you, sir.

312
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,418
I don't have an appointment
with any large men.

313
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,838
You Skinner?

314
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,923
I'm Principal Skinner, yes.

315
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,134
And how, may I ask,
did you get past the hall monitors?

316
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,973
(snickering)

317
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:13,227
Children, I don't know
how to break this to you,

318
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,104
but Principal Skinner is...

319
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,981
missing.

320
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,650
(cheering)

321
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,776
Uh-oh.

322
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,786
-(gasps)
-Wha--

323
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,830
(sputtering)

324
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,748
Hm-mmm.

325
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,877
I thought I found him,
but it was only a cat.

326
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,843
-Chief Wiggum?
-Chief Wiggum?

327
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,761
Now, please.
Please, I can assure you

328
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,015
we'll be using the most advanced
scientific techniques

329
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,600
in the field of...

330
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,767
body finding.

331
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,647
I see wedding bells

332
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,108
for Vanna White
and Teddy Kennedy.

333
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,028
Please, Princess Opal, if we could
just stick to Principal Skinner.

334
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,615
Chief Wiggum, I am merely
a conduit for the spirits.

335
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,492
(gasps) Willie Nelson
will astound his fans

336
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,077
by swimming
the English Channel.

337
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,162
Really? Willie Nelson?

338
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,376
He loved fire drills.

339
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,962
Will you get a hold
of yourself, lass

340
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,005
for the wee bairns.

341
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,798
Hey! Look at me!

342
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,426
-I'm Skinner's body.
-That is not funny, Louis.

343
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,720
Well, I heard Skinner's buried
under his parking spot.

344
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,514
I heard he was ground up into
hamburger and served to us at lunch.

345
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,683
I heard Bart had Skinner
killed by gangsters.

346
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,226
That's not true.
It's just a rumor.

347
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,062
You're engaged in speculation.

348
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,813
I know the law.
You can't prove anything.

349
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,486
(groaning)

350
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,615
Whaa!

351
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,283
You killed me, Bart!

352
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,952
(screams)

353
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,286
-Nuhh...
-Nuhh...

354
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,287
Nuhh!

355
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,252
(gurgling)
You killed me, Bart!

356
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,254
(screams)

357
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,260
You k-k-killed me, Bart.

358
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:16,266
(screaming)

359
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,060
(grunting)

360
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,271
Reverend Lovejoy!

361
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,440
You've come to comfort me?

362
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,733
Yes, Bart.

363
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,485
There, there.

364
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,278
There, there.

365
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,905
(jeering)

366
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,159
Kill my boy.

367
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,160
Kill my boy.

368
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,459
There.

369
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,509
(screaming)

370
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,725
You're eight hours
early for work.

371
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,726
I like that.

372
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,144
Did you kill my principal?

373
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,146
Uh, Chinese guy
with a moustache?

374
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,772
No. My principal!

375
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,734
That Skinner guy?
No, we didn't kill him.

376
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,527
Nobody move!
You're all under arrest

377
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,988
for the murder
of Seymour Skinner.

378
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,949
-What's a murder?
-Don't play dumb with me.

379
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,242
Cuff 'em, boys.

380
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,789
Oh, Bart.

381
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,499
Why couldn't you
have gotten a paper route

382
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,876
like other boys?

383
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,335
Wait till I get you home, boy.

384
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,879
What's that guy
doing here?

385
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,547
Lionel hats,
court appointed attorney.

386
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,090
I'll be defending you
on the charge of...

387
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,717
murder one!

388
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,886
Wow. Even if I lose
I'll be famous.

389
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,059
That Simpson boy
is looking at 180 years.

390
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,562
Thank God we live in a country
so hysterical over crime

391
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,857
that a ten-year old child
can be tried as an adult.

392
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,193
I didn't order
this Skinner guy killed.

393
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,195
But aren't you
the head of this gang?

394
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,197
No. I just stop by
the club occasionally

395
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,491
to read the complimentary
newspaper.

396
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:59,036
Then who is the kingpin,
the <i>capo di tutti capi?</i>

397
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,872
-That's the guy.
-Hey!

398
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,208
Forgive me, Don Bartholomew.

399
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,959
We tried to stop the kid,

400
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,878
but he wouldn't quit.
It was like he went crazy.

401
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,672
Prostitution, loan sharking,
numbers...

402
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,384
the kid liked to wet his beak
in everything.

403
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,387
Mr. Simpson, you've been
the boy's father for ten years.

404
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,556
Do you really think
he could be the leader

405
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,059
of a murderous
criminal syndicate?

406
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,352
Well, not the leader...

407
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,853
I mean...

408
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,147
Oh, it's true, it's true!

409
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,857
All the pieces fit.

410
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,026
(audience murmuring)

411
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,239
Now, in light of the damning
testimony

412
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,241
from your fellow gangsters,
your father,

413
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,159
your teachers,
and a seemingly endless parade

414
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,787
of emotionally shattered
baby-sitters,

415
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,248
this court has no choice
but to...

416
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,999
-Stop!
-(crowd gasps)

417
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,961
-MARGE: Principal Skinner!
-I thought he was dead.

418
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,088
I suppose you're all wondering
where I 've been.

419
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,882
It all started a week ago.
I was at my desk

420
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,218
revising and updating
the school dress codes

421
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,012
<i>when I was suddenly confronted</i>
<i>by a gang of toughs</i>

422
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,890
<i>acting on behalf</i>
<i>of one Bart Simpson...</i>

423
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,308
<i>or so they said.</i>

424
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,269
We really think there's
promise in the boy.

425
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,438
-Get out!
-Okay, okay. You don't have to yell.

426
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,232
<i>To get my mind</i>
<i>off that ugly confrontation</i>

427
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,819
<i>I went home and began bundling</i>
<i>my old newspapers.</i>

428
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,989
<i>But suddenly the pile fell.</i>
<i>I was trapped.</i>

429
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,700
<i>Let this be a lesson</i>
<i>to recycle frequently.</i>

430
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:23,328
<i>For the next week, I stayed alive</i>
<i>by eating my mother's delicious preserves</i>

431
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,414
<i>and maintained my sanity</i>

432
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,249
<i>by dribbling a nearby basketball</i>
<i>with my one free hand.</i>

433
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,002
I made a game of it.
Seeing how many times

434
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:33,088
I could bounce the ball in a day,
then trying to break that record.

435
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,216
<i>Occasionally, the police</i>
<i>arrived to search my home.</i>

436
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,968
Find anything this time, boys?

437
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,803
-No sign of him, Chief.
-Princess opal?

438
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,306
I see nothing here.
But I'm afraid it's Splitsville

439
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,682
for Delta Burke
and Major Dad.

440
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,726
But they seemed so happy.

441
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,062
<i>I shouted until I was hoarse,</i>
<i>but they couldn't hear me.</i>

442
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,772
I'm in here!

443
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,817
-WIGGUM: Well, let's go.
-Okay, Chief.

444
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,195
<i>Finally, I realized if I was ever</i>
<i>going to get out of there,</i>

445
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,030
<i>I would have to do it myself.</i>

446
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,448
<i>I formed a crude rocket</i>

447
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,366
<i>from a discarded</i>
<i>cigar tube.</i>

448
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,202
<i>And remembering an experiment</i>
<i>from my days</i>

449
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,995
<i>as a fourth-grade</i>
<i>science teacher,</i>

450
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,580
<i>I concocted a fuel</i>
<i>from baking soda</i>

451
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,707
<i>and the juice of discarded</i>
<i>lemon wedges.</i>

452
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,586
<i>The rocket took off with a</i>
<i>mighty blast of carbon dioxide</i>

453
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,463
<i>dragging behind it, the end of</i>
<i>a vacuum cleaner cord.</i>

454
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,049
<i>I grabbed onto</i>
<i>the vacuum cleaner,</i>

455
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,343
<i>pushed the cord-retractor</i>
<i>button</i>

456
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,637
<i>and was on my way to freedom.</i>

457
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,722
And that's my courageous story.

458
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,516

459
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,019
Your Honor, the prosecution moves
that Principal Skinner's testimony

460
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,229
be stricken from the record.

461
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,773
Denied. Case dismissed.

462
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,815

Hey, Bart, I hope there are
no hard feelings.

00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,366
-Get bent.
-I deserve that.
