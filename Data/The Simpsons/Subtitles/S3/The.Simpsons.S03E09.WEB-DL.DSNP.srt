-Next.
-"What are your son's hobbies?"

177
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,766
Well, he's always chewing on
that phone cord.

178
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,560
He hasn't done that
since he was two.

179
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,896
-Then he has no hobbies.
-Oh, really?

180
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,482
Well, maybe you should go out
to the garage and see.

181
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,612
-Bart. Bart!
-What?

182
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,030
You don't have any hobbies,
do you, boy?

183
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,072
No, not really.

184
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,866
Well, that's what I...

185
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:12,950
Wait a minute,
What are you doing?

186
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,619
Building a Soap Box Derby racer.

187
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,620
(groans)

188
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,913
That's a hobby.

189
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,456
Hey, so it is.

190
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,916
Oh, my God.

191
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,792
I don't know jack about my boy.

192

Oh, yeah? Are you building
a racer, Martin?

211
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,054
In between some other projects.

212
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,889
Well, gentlemen,
if you'll excuse me,

213
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,391
I've booked some time

For starters, Mr. Simpson,
why don't you take

220
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,916
this complimentary copy of <i>Fatherhood</i>
by Bill Cosby.

221
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,128
If he's as smart
as he is funny, I'm sold.

222
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,130
Mr. Simpson,
if you want to be a good father,

223
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,299
you have to spend time
with your son.

224
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,967
That's easy for you to say,

225
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,053
you preachy, egg-headed
institute guy.

226
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,805
How much do you see your son?

227
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,557
Why don't you ask him
yourself.

228
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,809
-Homer, meet Dave, Jr.
-Huh?

229
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,686
How's your research coming, son?

230
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,646
I think we're near
a breakthrough.

231
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,064
-Good work.
-Thanks, Dad.

232
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,899
Oh, how I envy you.

233
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,651
Homer, that easy back
and forther you witnessed

234
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,652
didn't happen overnight.

235
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,321
It took years of effort.

236
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,615
I've never been afraid
of a little hard work.

237
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,450
That's the spirit,
Mr. Simpson.

238
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,453
Now, step one is to find an activity
the two of you can share.

239
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,579
Does the boy
have any interests?

240
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,122
-What boy?
-Your son.

241
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,583
Find something he likes to do
and share in it.

242
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,711
Well, he is building
a Soap Box Derby racer!

243
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,213
-Oh, that would be perfect.
-(klaxon blaring)

244
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,050
Dear God! Not again!

245
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,803
Bart, I'm going to help you
build that racer.

246
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,597
Thanks,
but I'm almost done.

247
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,349
Why don't you get back
on the couch and watch TV.

248
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,350
Okay.

249
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,393
No! I'm going to do it.

250
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,772
Sorry, Dad, but three-time Soap Box
Derby champion Ronnie Beck

251
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,190
never needed his dad's help.

252
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,108
But you can use me.
I'm good.

253
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,027
I built a lot of things
around the house:

254
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,614
-The spice rack.
-(glass shatters)

255
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,698
The bird feeder.

256
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,409
The Gymboree.

257
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,040
What was that?
Ah, who cares?

258
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,291
Son, please let me help you.

259
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,210
Come on, Dad.
It would be weird.

260
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,337
This isn't working at all.

261
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,338
It's hopeless.

262
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,839

you should let me help you.

274
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,823
Oh, come on, Dad,

275
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,282

brushes.

Ugh! Your father's not
supposed to help build your racer,

295
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,302
but you should at least
consult him about it.

00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,399

Owee! Owee! Owee! Ow!

337
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,960
Mm-hmm.

338
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,628
Young man, I'm afraid
this stress fracture

339
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,631
will require you
to be in a cast for six weeks.

340
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,925
But that means
I can't possibly race.

341
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,302
Son, you're lucky
to be alive.

342
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,845
Save your palliative clichés

Doctor.

344
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,807

345
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,350
(chuckling)
Of course.

346
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,060
Hey, man, cool crash.

347
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,605
-Way to cheat death.
-Thanks, Bart.

348
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,481
You had the best stick
out there, man.

349
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,609
I wish I could
build 'em like you.

350
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,570
That racer transformed me
into the twisted creature

351
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,405
you see before you.

352
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,699
I'll never race again.

353
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,826
If you don't race,
then Nelson will win.

354
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,330
Even if I wanted to,
I'm in no shape to do it.

355
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,789
Unless...

356
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,542
Bart, will you drive my car?

357
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,336
I don't know
if I should do that.

358
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,212
My Dad and I built
our car together,

359
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,090
and if I drove someone else's,
it would kill him.

360
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,301
On the other hand, I'll do it.

361
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,304
Okay, Bart. We've got
a lot of work to do on the car.

362
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,765
So I'm gonna pull you out of school
for the next couple of weeks.

363
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,267
Dad, I don't know
how to say this, but..

364
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,727
I don't want to drive your car.

365
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,646
It's slow, it's ugly.

366
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,648
It handles
like a shopping cart.

367
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,691
Bart, the car has a few bugs
in it, I admit that,

368
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,526
but we're Team Simpson.

369
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,030
Dad, I love you,
but you taught me to win.

370
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,156
When did I ever
teach you that?

371
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,824
Well, I picked it up somewhere.

372
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,952
And if I drive Martin's car,
I can win.

373
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,161
I'm sorry, but...

374
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,038
No, go ahead, leave me.

375
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,040
-Dad...
-Go on. Go on and win.

376
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,000
No, go on and win
without your Dad.

377
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,711
I'll just sit here
in Li'l Lightnin',

378
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,880
which the Simpsons built,

379
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,966
and remember that
for one brief shining moment,

380
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,926
I had a son.

381
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,890
Ow.

382
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,981
Ohh!

383
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,191
Dad, can you take me
to Dr. Hibbert's office?

384
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,443
-Why? What's wrong?
-Oh, nothing.

385
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,195
I just scheduled a tetanus
booster.

386
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,697
Maybe I'm being
a little anal,

387
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,573
but barefoot season's coming up

388
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,200
and there's a world
of rusty nails out there.

389
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,535
Oh, sure, I'll take you,

390
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,537
wait with you,
worry about you,

391
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,789
and then you'll ride home with
someone who has a faster car.

392
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,874
This is how you get your kicks,
isn't it, Lisa?

393
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,292
Hmm.

394
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,546
D'oh!

395
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,217
Martin, your bone
is healing nicely.

396
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,969
Tell me something
I don't know.

397
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,512
(chuckles)

398
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,888
Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a...

399
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,223
You!

400
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,975
Home wrecker!

401
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,478
Mr. Simpson, you have every
right to be angry.

402
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,647
But rest assured,
your son loves you.

403
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,357
-(growls)
-(screams)

404
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,568
(Hibbert laughs)

405
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,570
You certainly gave that boy
the heebie-jeebies.

406
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,370
-Dad, aren't you coming?
-No.

407
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,623
-Now, don't pout.
-I'm not pouting. You are.

408
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,584
Dad, you gotta come.

409
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,627
-I just got your hat out of the fridge.
-Sorry.

410
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,963
Don't you at least
have something to say to Bart?

411
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,507
HOMER:
No. Can't think of a thing.

412
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,510
Homer, I've always said
you were a good father.

413
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,597
I've always defended you
when people put you down.

414
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,932
-That's for sure.
-She ain't lyin'.

415
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,559
But I guess I was wrong.

416
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,686
You are a bad father.

417
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,812
Leave me alone.

418
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,194
(fanfare playing)

419
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,029
TV ANNOUNCER:
<i>Good morning, everybody,</i>

420
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,156
<i>and welcome to an event</i>
<i>that harkens back</i>

421
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,533
<i>to the carefree days</i>
<i>of the Great Depression--</i>

422
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,160
<i>The Soap Box Derby.</i>

423
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,037
<i>In just minutes,</i>

424
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,290
<i>these junior Al Unser, Jrs.</i>
<i>will lock horns.</i>

425
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,709
Huh?

426
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,795
"Name your son's hobbies."

427
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,922
Building a soap box racer.

428
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,216
"Name one
of your child's friends."

429
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,217
Martin.

430
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,802
Martin!

431
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,970
I'll curse that name
till the day I die!

432
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,639
Huh?

433
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,933
"Who is your son's hero?"

434
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,228
Three-time Soap Box Derby
champion, Ronnie Beck.

435
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,606
Wow. I'm one question away
from being a perfect father.

436
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,484
"Name another dad
you talk to about parenting."

437
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,485
Ohh!

438
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,694
Hey-hey-ho, Simpson.

439
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,988
Shut up, Flanders.
Flanders!

440
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,574
Flanders!
Flanders, uh... uh...

441
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,119
When should a boy start dating?

442
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,995
Well, sir, there are two schools
of thought on the subject...

443
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,455
Great! Thanks.

444
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,499
I talked to Flanders
about parenting!

445
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,626
I'm a perfect father!

446
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,836
Hold on, son.

447
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,003
I'm a-coming.

448
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,425
My friend and I have a bet.

449
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,387
Are you Mary Tyler Moore?

450
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,013
(screaming)

451
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,723
(belches)

452
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,393
Ooh! Wow!
It really is you.

453
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,979
Bart, if she breaks up on you,
steer away from the grandstands

454
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,107
or else you might kill hundreds
of innocent spectators.

455
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,900
Bart, what did I
just tell you?

456
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,611
Kill spectators.

457
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,488
What is the matter
with you?

458
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,615
It's my dad--
lying there on the couch

459
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,617
drinking a beer,
staring at the TV.

460
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,619
I've never seen him
like that.

461
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,538
Forget about your father!

462
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,998
You're driving for me now.

463
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,298
Do it for your old man, boy.

464
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,259
Simpson, prepare to die.

465
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,802
Let's rock.

466
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,804
MAN (on P.A.):
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

467

To everyone participating today,
I salute your vigor.

00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,732
Check out the rack on the blonde

471
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,112

00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,948

<i>The world has not seen</i>

479
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,858

484
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,912
Congratulations, Bart.

485
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,873
Seeing you out there brought
back a lot of memories.

486
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,124
Thanks, Mr. Beck.

487
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,751
I was alone out there,

488
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,545
but someone was riding
with me in spirit.

489
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,297
This is for you, Dad.

490
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,091
No, son, you earned it.

491
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,928
I might remind you both,
I did design that racer.

492
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,638
The driver
is essentially ballast.

493
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,600
The better man won, Simpson.

494
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,977
You can really drive.

495
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,979
Thanks, Nelson.
