he just say so?

hold it against him

32

You really put me in my place.

-Don't get me wrong.

48
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,492

at the plant

49

Nice to see you. Nice to meet you.

-Hey!
-Oh!

76
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,974
Hey, hey, Homer!

77
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,895
-(muttering)
-Okay. Thanks for coming.

78
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,189
-You're it.
-Electricity.

79
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,608
No electricity.
Electricity only in freeze tag.

80
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,026

The fly was funny,

84
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,660
and the booger
was the icing on the cake.

85
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,578
Friends, we love you all,

86
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,414
but I also have
a sinister motive

87
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,874
for asking you all here--

88
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,001
sinister being Latin
for left-handed.

89
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,878
(chuckling)
But enough joking.

90
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,338
-That was a joke?
-Shh!

91
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,131

92
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,175

to the pharmaceutical game.

93
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,427
-Leaving? I can't believe it.
-What's he talkin' about?

94
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,598
No, I kid you not. Here's the noose
I had to wear for ten years.

What are you going to do, Ned?

97
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,813
Well, sir, like one out
of every nine Americans,

98
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,190
I'm left-handed,
and let me tell you

99
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,067
it ain't all peaches
and cream.

100
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,735
Your writing gets smeared,

101
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,988
Lord help you if you want to
drive a standard transmission.

102
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,447
-Amen to that.
-Well, sir,

103
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,783
I'm opening up
a one-stop store for southpaws.

104
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,786
Everything from
left-handed apple peelers

105
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,413
to left-handed zithers.

106
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,540
Going to call it
"The Leftorium."

107
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,583
-(oohs and ahhs)
-(applause)

108
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,338
So, Homer,
I'm dying to know.

109
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,840
What do you think
of The Leftorium?

110
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,384
It sounds like
a pretty dumb idea to me.

111
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,219
Well, I know it's
a little risky,

112
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,805
and it's going to be
a lot of hard work,

113
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,141
but, gosh darn it, it's going
to be a lot of fun too.

114
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,768
Fun? Where is this store,
Flanders?

115
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,478
The merry old Land of Oz?

116
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,522
Oh, no. The Springfield Mall.

117
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,858
-Oh, here, you two, make a wish.
-Nah!

118
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,651
-It's fun.
-No, it isn't.

119
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,654
Hey, you must have something
you want to wish for, Homer.

120
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,032
Hmm, let's see...

121
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,783
Nah.

122
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,036
Hmm...

123
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,330
-Hey!
-Come on, Homer.

124
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,415
I've got an ambition
to do some wishin'.

125
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,667
Keep your pants on,
Flanders!

126
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,794
I'm wishing as fast as I can!

127
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,629
Ooh!

128
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,051
Heh, heh, heh, heh.

129
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,261
Eh... too far.

130
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,262
Hmm...

131
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,263
Okay, ready.

132
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,809
Yes! Oh, yes!

133
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,145
Read it and weep!
In your face!

134
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,315
-I've got more chicken bone!
-What did you wish for, Homer?

135
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,025
No! No, no, no.
Don't say.

136
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,276
Otherwise,
it won't come true.

137
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,029
Ooh, that would be a shame.

138
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,075

Don't you think you should get a little
fresh air and maybe some exercise?

Yeah, but what are
you going to do?

160
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,262
Marge, TV gives so much
and asks so little.

some much-needed exercise.

166
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,066

181
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,390
Hey, Mom, how about
if I learn karate?

182
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,017
Will that make you happy?

183
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,727
That sounds fine, Bart.

184
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,605
See, Marge, you knock TV,
and then it helps you out.

185
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,608
I think you owe somebody
a little apology.

186
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,734

187
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,403

Well, if it isn't
The Leftorium.

189
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,704
Hey, Flanders,
how's business?

190
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,955
Oh, a little pokey

191
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,290
but things are going

00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,084
I am so sorry.

194

How much do I owe you?

195
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,172
Now, you put that money away.
That was an accident.

196
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,507
Really?

197
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,549
Well, thanks.

198
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,885
Could you validate my parking?

199
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,930
Absitively posolutely.
(chuckles)

200
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,307
So, Flanders,
have you sold anything?

201
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,726
Not yet, but one
of the mall security guards

202
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,436
took a good long look

203
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,688
-at a left-handed ice cream scoop.
-(scoffs)

204
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,649
Greetings, I am Akira,

205
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,276
your guide on the path
to true karate.

206
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,238
And this is our map,
<i>The Art of War</i> by Sun-Tzu.

207
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,115
It will teach us
our most important lesson.

208
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,952
We learn karate
so that we need never use it.

209
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,328
Um, excuse me sir.

210
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,288
I already know
how not to hit a guy.

211
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,249
Can we break out
the nunchukas?

212
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,834
Yes, the impetuousness
of youth.

213
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,629
-For now, let us read.
-Akira, my good man,

214
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,297
when do we break blocks
of ice with our heads?

215
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,841
First you must fill your head
with wisdom.

216
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,260
Then, you can hit ice with it.

217
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,636
Yo, Sensei,
can I go to the bathroom?

218
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,846
You can
if you believe you can.

219
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,598
Pay money to read books.

220
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,350

The hell with this.

I'm telling you,

228
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,534
Flanders' store was dee-serted.

229
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,370
So, what do you think of your
bestest buddy now, Marge?

230
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,415
-(Marge grumbles)
-Dad, do you know what <i>schadenfreude</i> is?

231
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,293
No, I do not know
what <i>schadenfreude</i> is.

232
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,045
Please tell me,
because I'm dying to know.

233
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,631
It's a German term
for "shameful joy."

234
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,550
Taking pleasure
in the suffering of others. 

235
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:57,471
Oh, come on, Lisa. I'm just
glad to see him fall flat on his butt.

236
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,682
He's usually all happy
and comfortable

237
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,019
and surrounded by loved ones,
and it makes me feel--

238
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,812
What's the opposite of that
"shameful joy" thing of yours?

239
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,938
Sour grapes.

240
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,649
Boy, those Germans have
a word for everything.

241
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,943
So Bart, what did you learn
in karate school today?

242
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,613
Yeah, come on, boy, this better
be worth my ten bucks.

243
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,532
Uh... I learned
the touch of death.

244
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,160
-Ooh, the touch of death.
-Permit me to demonstrate.

245
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,788
Lisa, shut your eyes.
Soon you will be at peace.

246
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,291
-Hey, quit it, Bart. Quit it. Hey!
-(Bart vocalizing)

247
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,460
Quit it! Quit it!
Quit it! Quit it! Mom!

of death on your sister.

How was class?

Today, we learned how
to rip a man's heart out

and show it to him
before he dies.

Oh, I expect things to start

Lousy.
He just sits there all day.

Twenty bucks. Take it or leave it.

00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,579
-$20?
-$20.

348
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,038
-Now I don't want it.
-What?

349
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,165
I changed my mind.
It was a passing fancy.

350
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,501
Although, perhaps if you
threw in a few lawn chairs,

351
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:41,463
maybe that tool bench,
it might rekindle my interest.

352
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,135
Hey, Bartely-boobely.
Care for a steakarooni?

353
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,304
Sounds scrum-diddley-umptious,
dear old duddely-doodely.

354
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:52,558
-(laughing) Duddely-doodely.
-(both laugh)

355
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,060
Homer, this is the Flanders'
entire living room set.

356
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,562
How much did you pay
for this?

357
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,397
Only 75 beans.

358
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,275
$75? Ned must be desperate.

359
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,819
I'm sure you did nothing
to discourage this,

360
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,946
you scavenger of human misery.

361
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,365
Hey! Keep your hands off
my china hutch.

00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,082
Good afternoon, sir.
I'm Chuck Ellis

365
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,168
from the Springfield
Collection Agency,

366
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,544
and I'm here to ask you
why you don't think

367
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,379
you need to pay your bills.

368
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,841
Oh, I know I need to pay them,
but there's just so many.

369
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,218
Does it make you feel good about
yourself to owe people money?

370
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,846
We've been very patient
with you, Mr. Flanders.

371
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,848
I know, but--
Wait a minute.

372
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,183
I'm Homer Simpson.

373
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,976
Ned Flanders lives over there.

374
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,396
-Oh.
-Flanders is in debt? Are you sure?

375
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,774
We don't make mistakes.

376
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,068
Damned right-handed ledgers.

377
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,779
-I can't write in these things.
-Why, there's a store where you--

378
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,656
-Hey, you said you're Homer Simpson?
-Yeah.

379
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,741
-See you on Thursday.
-D'oh!

380
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,952

going to give it to you.

Not anymore!

403
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,462
You punks are about to get

404

a taste of your own medicine.

C'mon Bart. Start them off
with the touch of death

413
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,528
and go from there.

414
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,739
I think they've learned
their lesson already, Lise.

415
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,866
No, we want to see

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,295
It's funny how two wrongs
sometimes make a right.

419
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,969
Homer! Over here.

420
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,974
Flanders, I want to give you
your stuff back.

421
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,311
Well, there's no house
to put it in, Homer.

422
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,855
Not since that nice fellow
from the bank--

423
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:48,317
who was only doing his job--
came and locked it up.

424
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,902
You're gonna live in your car?

425
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,072
Oh, no. It's just
a little camp-out tonight,

426
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,449
then off to my sister's
apartment in Capital City.

427
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,034

-The big city.

I know.

441

At times like these

442
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,858
I used to turn to the Bible
and find solace,

443
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,277
but even the good book

444
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,030
-can't help me now.
-Why not?

445
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,616
-I sold it to you for seven cents.
-Oh.

You know,
ever since that barbecue,

447
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,247
nothing's gone right.

448
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,917
It's like there's been
a curse on me.

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,252
(sobbing)

450
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,170
It's all my fault.

451
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,089
-No, it's not.
-Yes, it is.

452
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,007
No! You tried to warn me

453
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,926
about gambling
my family's future

454
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,053
on some pig in a poke.

455
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,596
I didn't listen.

456
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,348
Homer, you were a true friend.

457
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,433
-No, I was a swine.
-(both sobbing)

458
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,811
-Listen, Flanders.
-What?

459
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,437
Do you still have that store?

460
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,939
For two more days.

461
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:12,234
Then it becomes
Libertarian Party headquarters.

462
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,194
I hope they have better luck
than I did.

463
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,446
Flanders, you open
that store tomorrow.

464
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,198
Oh, Homer, there's no point.

465
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,367
I said do it!

466
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,913
Hello, Jerry? Homer Simpson.

467
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,499
Remember last month
when I paid back that loan?

468
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,170
Well, now I need you
to do a favor for me.

469
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,922
A left-handed corkscrew?

470
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,132
Oh, baby!

471
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,676
"Kiss me, I'm left-handed"?

472
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,553

473
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:42,139
That's a classic.
Whoa!

00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:45,100
-Homer Simpson's on the phone.
-Tell him I went out.

475
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,852
He needs you
to help Ned Flanders.

476
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,145
Ned Flanders is in trouble?

477
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,315
Smithers, I'm licked.

478
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,941
You open this can.

479
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,860
Okay, but you softened
it up for me, sir.

480
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,362
Hold it, Smithers.

481
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,156
-I'll open the can.
-But, sir, how?

482
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,617
To the mall!
I'll explain on the way.

483
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,043
Hurry, Neddy, hurry.
Oh, golly, it's a miracle.

484
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,129
HOMER:
Come on, ya' lefties.

485
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,297
Oh! What did I tell you?

486
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,007
-(chuckles)
-Homer?

487
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,469
It's all here,
and it's all backwards.

488
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,678
That's right.

489
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,556

490
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:32,397
Well, the worm has turned,
has it not, my tin-plated friend?

491
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,317
Look at you--
you who were once so proud.

492
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,154
Feel the wrath
of the left hand of Burns.

493
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,199
My life begins today.

494
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,326
Wow! What an icebreaker.

495
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,953
Left-handed ledgers.

496
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,247
Now, I can write

Wow!

499
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,506
The boys at the Diners Club
will think I've gone quite mad.

500
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,175
Oh, I'll have that roadster
in the corner as well.

-Yes, sir.
-Huzzah for the shopkeep.

ALL: Huzzah!

504
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,228
Homer, affordable tract housing
made us neighbors,

505
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,105
but you made us friends.

506
