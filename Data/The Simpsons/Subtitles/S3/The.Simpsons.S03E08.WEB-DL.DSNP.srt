00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,445
If you keep spending time
with Lisa, she'll forgive you.

181
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,198
Marge, if I spend any more time
doing these girl things,

182
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,658
I'm gonna, you know,
go fruity.

183
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,036
No, you were right
the first time

184
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,370
with that quick fix idea.

185
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,664
Let's see--
quick fix, quick fix.

186
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,168
Ahh. I'll buy her that pony
she's always bugging me for.

187
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,128
We can't afford
to buy a pony.

188
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,546
Marge, with today's
gasoline prices,

189
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,964
we can't
afford not to buy a pony.

190
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,382
That's ridiculous.

191
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,551
Marge, I've gotta
get her a pony.

192
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,428
When I look in Lisa's eyes,
I don't see love anymore.

193
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,388
That's no reason
to buy a pony.

194
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,016
See, even when you yell at me,
I can see love in your eyes.

195
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,351
Stick to the subject.

196
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,144
(singsongy)
Ha, ha, you love me.

197
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,188
(groans)
Let's be realistic.

198
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,190
A pony is very expensive,

199
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,692
and we have enough trouble
paying bills as it is.

200
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,361
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

201
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,112
You sound like you're
going to buy a pony.

202
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,114
-Promise me you won't.
-Hmm.

203
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,658
What was that?
Was that a yes or a no?

204
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,661
-Baa.
-Those aren't even words.

205
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,162
-Sna.
-(groans)

206
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,586
Oh, my, what is that smell?

207
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,880
Oh, it's you.

208
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,340
Excuse me.
Do you sell ponies?

209
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,884
Uh, sure, pal.
Right here.

210
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,762
"Scottish Deer Hound."

211
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,931
Hey, this is a dog.

212
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,476
Ooh, my friend, you're smarter
than I gave you credit for.

213
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,771
I suggest you try
the Boney Farm on Route 401.

214
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,482
Merely take a left
at the rendering plant.

215
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,782
Now, lady, I'm buying a pony
for my little girl,

216
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,117
and I don't care
what it costs.

217
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,660
Very good.

218
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,120
That stunning creature
over there

219
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,663
is half a million dollars.

220
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,331
Half a million dollars?!

221
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,417
He was sired by Seattle Slew,

222
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,295
-and his mother won the Kentucky Derby.
-HOMER: Wow.

223
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,589
His likeness
graces a stamp in Tanzania.

224
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,882
-I'll take it!
-Mr. Simpson...

225
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,552
do you have
half a million dollars?

226
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,930
Uh, sure, let me
write you a check.

227
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:58,973
Hmm.

228
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,435
Mr. Simpson,

229
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:06,355
this check is dated
January 1, 2054.

230
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,357
Is there a problem
with that?

231
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,569
Our ponies start
at $5,000... cash.

232
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,822
Isn't there like a pound

233
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,532
where you can pick up
cheap ponies

234
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,658
that ran away from home?

235
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,036
I sincerely hope not.

236
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,916
I-- I'd like
to borrow $5,000.

237
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,585
Sorry.

238
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,669
I can't approve
a loan that size myself.

239
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,670
(rings bell)

240
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,174
-Hello.
-(scream)

241
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,468
"Simpson," eh?
How can I help you?

242
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,595
Mr. Burns,
you do this personally?

243
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,347
It's a hobby.

244
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,307
I'm not in this for any
personal gain. Heavens no.

245
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,683
By the way, are you
acquainted with

246
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,810
our state's
stringent usury laws?

247
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,188
-Usury?
-Oh, silly me.

248
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,773
I must've just made up
a word that doesn't exist.

249
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,025
Now, what is the purpose
of this loan?

250
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,777
I want to buy a pony.

251
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,487
Isn't that cute?

252
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,947
Smithers, he's planning
on joining the horsey set.

253
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:00,868
That is it, isn't it?
You're not planning to eat it?

254
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,703
No I need to get it
for my little girl because

255
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,829
she doesn't love me anymore.

256
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,164
-Shut up, Simpson.
-Sorry.

257
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,999
You have any collateral?

258
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,043
Oh, Smithers,
let's not be so cold.

259
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,671
His spirit
is my collateral.

260
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:16,133
Just sign this form
and the money will be yours.

261
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,135
(diabolical laughter)

262
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,805
Sorry, I was just thinking

263
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,890
of something funny
Smithers did today.

264
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,350
I didn't do anything
funny, sir.

265
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,102
Shut up.

266
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,147
Mr. Simpson,

267
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:34,110
are you quite sure you know
how to take care of a pony?

268
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,403
Of course.

269
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,572
Simpson, you've done it again.

270
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,046
(screaming)

271
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,680
I love you, Dad!

272
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,308
(groans)

273
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,936
I am very upset with you.

274
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,312
Sounds like someone's
angling

275
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,398
for a pony of her own.

276
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,316
(gasping)

277
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,485
Hey, how come Lisa
gets a pony?

278
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,195
Because she
stopped loving me.

279
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,947
I don't love ya' either,
so gimme a moped.

280
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,993
I know you love me,
so you don't get squat.

281
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,537
Snowball II,
Santa's Little Helper--

282
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,164
this is Princess.

283
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,208
Please don't exclude her
because she's different.

284
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,214
Homer, just where were you
planning to keep this horse?

285
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,008
I've got it
all figured out.

286
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:43,012
By day, it will roam free
around the neighborhood,

287
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,805
and at night,
it will nestle snugly

288
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,432
between the cars
in our garage.

289
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,893
-Dad, no!
-That's illegal.

290
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,312
That's for the courts
to decide.

291
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,646
Marge, she loves me.

292
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,317
Dad, I think Princess
belongs in a stable.

293
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,986
Stable?
That sounds expensive.

294
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,363
This is what love costs
a month?

295
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,366
These are standard
stable fees, Mr. Simpson.

296
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,912
Plus, I'm teaching your daughter
riding, grooming,

297
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,456
and at no extra charge,
pronunciation.

298
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,749
(with British accent)
Father, you've made me

299
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,168
the happiest girl
who ever lived.

300
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,128
Oh, nuts.

301
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,174
GRANDPA: What do I do?
What do I do?

302
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,675
Grandpa, if you want
to go right,

303
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,718
move the joy stick to the left.

304
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,345
Yes. Move the--

305
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,013
What's a joy stick?
You didn't tell me--

306
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,474
Here comes a Xylon cruiser!
Woah, woah woah!

307
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,142
Go into hyperspace!
Ready, hit it!

308
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,645
Wait!
Where's the hyperspace?

309
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,146
Grandpa, you're the spaceship,
not the--

310
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,106
I'm the what?
I thought I was this guy.

311
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,943
Oh!

312
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,486
Game's over, Grandpa.

313
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,737
I got down on the floor
for this?!

314
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,283
Wait, Dad.
I've got something for you.

315
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,287
I was hoping
it would be money.

316
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:56,377
Oh, dear. We're
in serious trouble here.

317
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,213
We're just going to have
to cut down on luxuries.

318
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,841
Well, you know we're always
buying Maggie vaccinations

319
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,467
for diseases
she doesn't even have.

320
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,386
Actually, I was thinking
we could cut down on beer.

321
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,221
Nah, we're not going
to be doing that.

322
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,722
Then I'm afraid
there's no choice

323
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,307
but to give up the pony.

324
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,309
First you didn't
want me to get the pony.

325
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,520
Now you want me
to take it back.

326
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,521
Make up your mind.

327
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,730
Homer!

328
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,774
Marge, Lisa loves me.
The pony stays.

329
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,526
Alright. You got us
into this.

330
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,195
-You get us out.
-Fine, I will.

331
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,530
There's plenty of money
out there

332
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,448
for a guy who's
willing to work for it.

333
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,159
Do you have any jewelry
you don't need anymore?

334
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,703
(groans)

335
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,998
You're so beautiful.

336
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:37,167
Oh, look, you haven't
touched your salt lick.

337
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,961
Num-num.
Good salt lick.

338
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,510
HOMER:
Need money. Need money.

339
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,053
One scratch-for-cash, please.

340
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,179
Here you go.

341
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,514
Liberty bell.

342
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,474
(gasps)
Two liberty bells.

343
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,977
Come on,
come on, come on...

344
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,145
Oh.

345
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,271
Yes!

346
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,397
Whoo-whoo!

347
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,399
Three liberty bells!

348
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,568
That will be
$10,000, Apu.

349
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,445
Congratulations,
Mr. Homer.

350
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,571
Thank you.

351
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,239
If I could just see
the ticket...

352
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,074

Oh, Mr. Homer,

361
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,009
what has reduced you
to such cheap chicanery?

362
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,510
Oh... I need money.

363
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,095
Well, if you need money,

364
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,890
you should have at least
jammed a gun in my ribs,

365
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,224

that horse.

376
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,330

There is only one bozo
who comes in and buys them.
