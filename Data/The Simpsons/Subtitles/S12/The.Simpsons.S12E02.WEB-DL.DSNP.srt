00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,129
Whoa! (scared)

15
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,340
Hmm? Hmm?

16
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,550
Hmm?

17
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,761
Hey, if you're out here,

18
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,221
then who's in there?

19
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,974
-Whoa! A badger!
-(growling)

20
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,726
Sorry, man. You can't crash here.

21
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,353
Come on, let's go.

22
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,188
(growling)

23
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,815
-(whimpers)
-Well, boy, looks like

24
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,066
you got yourself a roommate.

25
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,443
-(grunting)
-(whimpering)

26
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:53,947
Come on, Lise. There's got to be a way

27
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,198
to lure that badger out.

28
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,826
Well, according to whatbadgerseat.com,

29
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,285
"Badgers subsist primarily

30
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,122
on a diet of stoats, voles, and marmots."

31
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,457
Hmm, stoats, stoats...

32
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,667
Stoats are weasels, Bart.

33
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,876
They don't come in cans.

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,795
Then what's this?

35
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,588
That says "corn," Bart.

36
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,049
Must you embarrass me?

37
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,551
Here we are,

38
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,512
"In a pinch, badgers have even
been known to eat woodpeckers."

39
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,389
Perfect! Hey, Todd,

40
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,557
can we borrow your woodpecker?

41
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,808
I guess so.

42
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,393
But we need him back by 6:00.

43
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,936
It's his birthday.

44
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,563
-OK.
-(screeching)

45
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,773
-(humming)
-(snarling and growling)

46
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,567

47
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,319
Ahh... Ow!

48
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,404
(laughs like Woody Woodpecker)

49
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,449
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

50
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,160
(humming)

51
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:43,997
Television broken?

52
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,540
No, there's a badger in there.

53
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,875
Badger, my ass!

54
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,585
It's probably Milhouse.

55
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,211
Milhouse... Milhouse...

56
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,588
(growling and snapping)

57
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,882
(Homer screaming)

58
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,804
(groans)

59
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,014
It's a badger, all right.

60
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,348
Or possibly a griffin.

61
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,933
Bart, do you have
any dynamite in your room?

62
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:04,851
-Tons.
-Get it.

63
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,603
No, Dad, we don't want to kill him.

64
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,104
Let's call animal control.

65
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,355
Great idea.

66
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,149
Then we should
call a doctor about this.

67
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,319
How did the badger do that
without ripping your shirt?

68
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,528
What am I, a tailor?

69
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,447
Hmm-hmm. Hmm

70
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,158
(hums)

71
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,659
-(tri-tone beeps)
-Hmm?

72
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,870
RECORDED VOICE: <i>Your call</i>
<i>cannot be completed as dialed.</i>

73
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,206
<i>Please make sure you have</i>
<i>the correct area code.</i>

74
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,917
Area code? But it's a local call!

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,919
The phone company ran out of numbers,

76
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,796
so they split the city
into two area codes.

77
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,758
Half the town
keeps the old 636 area code,

78
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,843
and our half gets 939.

79
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,888
939? What the hell is that?

80
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,973
Oh, my life is ruined!

81
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,601
Jeez, you just have to remember
three extra numbers.

82
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,937
Oh, if only it were that easy, Marge.

83
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,396
-(growling)
-Go away!

84
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,773
We got bigger problems now!

85
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,942
I'm not going to stand for this.

86
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,569
I'm going to call
the newspapers, the TV stations,

87
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,529
the gas stations, everybody!

88
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,201
-(tri-tone beeps)
-(screaming)

89
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,912
(beeping continues)

90
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,331
(whimpering)

91
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,420
HOMER: I hate this new area code.

92
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,131
Like I don't have enough
to remember already.

93
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,466
Is that right?

94
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,803
Don't you miss the old 636... Carl?

95
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,596
I'm not sure which one's better.

96
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,265
The six is closer to the three,

97
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,808
so you got convenience there,

98
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,643
But the nine
has less to do with Satan,

99
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,020
which is a plus
in this religious world of ours.

100
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,146
What really burns me up

101
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,399
is they didn't give us
one word of warning.

102
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,316
What do you mean?

103
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,859
They ran those TV commercials about it

104
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,361
and that big radio campaign.

105
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,570
Don't forget the leaflets they dropped

106
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,488
from the space shuttle

107
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,949
and the two weeks we all spent
at area code camp.

108
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,368
Not a single word of warning.

109
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,161
BILL (on radio): And traffic's
all backed up

110
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,746
due to a mattress on the freeway.

111
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,206
A mattress? Uh-oh!

112
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,333
Joan Collins must be in town.

113
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,002
(both laughing)

114
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,421
AUSTIN POWERS: <i>Oh, behave!</i>

115
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,047

116
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,340
Joan Collins!

117
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,134
That girl sleeps with everybody!

118
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,969
OK, time to give away

119
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,971

121
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,807
Whoa-ho. What we're
talkin' about, Gary,

122
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,100
is The Who!

123
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,269
We're giving away tickets
to next week's concert

124
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,021

125
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,523
Yahoo search engine arena!

126
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,108
(gasps) The Who?

127
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,776
I love bands!

128
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,863
And now, we'll dial
our big winner at random.

00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,615
JINGLE SINGERS:

MR. BURNS (on radio): <i>Ahoy, hoy.</i>

136
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,006
Hey... that's not me.

137
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,133
Dad, we're not
in their area code anymore.

138
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,676
BILL: <i>Congratulations, you're gonna</i>

139
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,887
<i>rendezvous with The Who!</i>

140
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,848
Oh, it's not fair!

141
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,517
I've been a fan of The Who
since the very beginning

142
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,227
when they were
The Hillbilly Bugger Boys.

143
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,521
You should call that radio
station and let 'em have it.

144
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,564
Good idea!

145
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:58,983
(tri-tone beeps)

146
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,194
-(laughing)
-Why, you little...

147
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,696
(grunting)

148
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,615
Ow!

149
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,075
Ow!

150
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:07,992
Ow!

151
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,994
Oh!

152
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,372
(both grunting)

153
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,792
I know that some of you are upset

154
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,543
about the area code change

155
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,629
especially those of you
covered with dynamite.

156
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,882
First, let me reassure you

157
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,425
your fears are groundless

158
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,260
and your complaints, moronic.

159
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,220
-(murmuring)
-That's good.

160
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,305
This film will explain
everything to you

161
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,140
in words that you can understand.

162
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,266
(film projector whirring)

163
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,146
<i>Hi, I'm Phoney McRingring,</i>

<i>mascot and president</i>

165
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,817

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,444

AUTOMATED VOICE: Your town.

168

...has been replaced
by the convenience

169
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,074
of two area codes.

170
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,909
Uh, I have a question, Phoney...

171
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,285
It's a movie, Dad.

172
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,538
Quiet, honey, daddy's asking
the man a question.

173
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,914
You're probably thinking,

174
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,916
"Sure, more area codes are great

175
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,293
and I don't mind paying
the extra hidden fees,

176
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,879
but how will I remember
all those numbers?"

177
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,464
Whoa!

178
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,633
Well, scientists have discovered

179
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,594
that even monkeys
can memorize ten numbers.

180
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,763
Are you stupider than a monkey?

181
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,056
How big of a monkey?

182
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,349
(laughing)

183
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,684
Of course you're not.

184
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,520
Well, I'm convinced.

185
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,189
A professional-looking film
like that has got to be right.

186
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,775
I agree. Two area codes
is more convenient.

187
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,402
-MAN: I like it.
-Wait a minute,

188
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,987
we haven't heard from me yet,

189
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,238
the nut with the dynamite!

190
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,866
The phone company
is bamboozling you.

191
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,451
(murmuring)

192
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,077
I accuse the phone company

193
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,121
of making that film on purpose.

194
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,330
Well, of course we did.

195
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,373
(all gasping)

196
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,876
Now, I'm not one to make trouble,

197
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,878
but it seems to me that everyone

198
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,129
who got to keep the old,

199
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,882
or classic 636 area code,

200
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,135
lives on the rich side of town!

201
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,178
Ooh, poppycock.

202
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,846
-I never!
-Eh.

203
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,723
And, as usual,

204
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,475
we Joe 12-packs

205
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,060
get the royal screw job.

206
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,103
Homer's right!

207
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,481
We're getting the Joan Collins special.

208
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,108
(clamoring)

209
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,443
Well, I've had it!

210
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,030
You rich snobs aren't
pushing us around any more!

211
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,782
And what are you pathetic slobs
going to do about it?

212
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,284
Well, I...

213
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,619
(grunting)

214
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,830
Huh?
(grunting)

215
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,499
Oh, nice wiring, Bart.

216
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,958
It worked on the test corpse.

217
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,043
OK, plan B.

218
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,003
Fellow 939-ers,

219
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,507
I say we break off
and form our own city!

220
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,175
(all cheering)

221
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,593
- MAN 1: Yes!
- MAN 2: We're with you, Homer!

222
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,136
Come on! Let's go!

223
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,014
-(all cheering)
-(in Spanish) <i>Viva la revolucian!</i>

224
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,516
HOMER (in English): No, who's stupid.

225
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,356
There, we're officially a city.

226
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,109
Now we just sit back
and wait for an NFL franchise.

227
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,320
(whistling)

228
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,821
Say, I couldn't help but overhear.

229
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,782
I represent the Arizona cardinals...

230
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,450
-Keep walking.
-Mmm.

231
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,202
Good decision there, Homer.

232
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,745
You showed a lot of poise.

233
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,540
Yeah, maybe you ought
to be mayor of New Springfield.

234
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,083
Mayor, eh?

235
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,378
(gunshots)

236
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,089
NARRATOR: <i>The Mayor.</i>

237
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,259
<i>Starring Homer Simpson.</i>

238
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,886
I reluctantly accept

239
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,973
this highly-paid glamorous job.

240
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,225
MAYOR QUIMBY:
Presenting our new plaque.

241
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,142
(all cheering)

242
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,562
I say the time for bitterness
has passed.

243
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,940
Let us extend to our brothers
in New Springfield

244
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:26,941
the olive branch of...

245
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,859
-(groans)
-New Springfield rocks!

246
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,528
(all laughing)

247
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,113
Go ahead and laugh.

248
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,781
We have a better town bird.

249
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,575
Oh, yeah? What is it?

250
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,742
The bluebird.

251
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,580
-Damn it.
-More wheatcakes, Mr. Mayor?

252
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,624
Read my lips... Yes.

253
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,251
Dad, you got syrup on your sash.

254
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,628
No problem.
(grunts)

255
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,546
If you ask me...

256
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,463
HOMER: Stop right there.

257
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,715
It's stupid to divide the city

258
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,758
over something
as silly as an area code.

259
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,302
It'd be like
you and Mom splitting up

260
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,845
every time you have a fight.

261
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,305
Sweetie, you know your mother and I

262
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,264
only stay together

263
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,932
for the sake of my political career.

264
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,100
That's not true.

265
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,893
Big grins.

266
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,103
Mwah!

267
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,022
That'll play great in the sticks.

268
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,773
(slurps)

269
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,941
(hums)

270
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,860
Oh, that was 50 already?

271
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,654
Go long!

272
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,242
(grunts)

273
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,537
Hey, look what I found,

274
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,205
a novelty flying disc.

275
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,582
BART: Give it back.

276
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,125
That's my novelty flying disc.

277
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,586
You're in Olde Springfield now.

278
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,298
Everything on this side
of the park belongs to us.

279
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,925
Hey, his pants are in our park, too.

280
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,010
Get him!

281
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,011
(grunting)

282
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,680
(laughing)

283
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,184
My homework is in your park.

284
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:44,977
Let's do it!

285
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:45,978
Yoink!

286
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,314
What's does freedom mean to me?

287
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,191
APU: All right, root beer, bananas

288
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,567
and toilet paper.

289
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,986
50% out-of-towners' tax.

290
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,321
Out-of-towner tax?

291
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,739
I'm sorry, Mrs. Simpson,

292
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,325
but we have to charge
you foreign devils more.

293
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,410
All right, but this better be

294
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,496
the best toilet paper I've ever had.

295
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,081
Oh, no worries there.

296
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,666
That's Henderson's toilet paper.

297
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,959
Oh, why didn't you say so?

298
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,503
Hey, is there a bathroom here?

299
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:11,629
Not for you.

300
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,672
(grumbles)

301
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,091
MARGE: I don't know why,

302
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,426
but I just didn't feel comfortable

303
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,512
until I was back here
in New Springfield

304
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,554
with my own kind.

305
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,639
Mom!

306
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,015
They were looking at me

307
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,267
with their eyes.

-You come here a minute.

Thank you, Marge.

00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,298
<i>and fly it over here from France.</i>

364
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,549
Oh!

365
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,926
Thanks, Mayor Simpson.

366
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,929
Because of you, we're all
taking golden showers.

367
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,306
-(crew laughing)
-What?

368
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,476
We can't go on fighting
with Olde Springfield.

369
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,936
These people are our neighbors.

370
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,729
We see them every day.

371
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,730
You're right.

372
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,357
We've got to block them
from our sight

373
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,483
with a giant wall.

374
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,151
Like the one in Berlin?

375
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,569
Good idea.

376
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,279
We should call the guys
they used.

377
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,784
(tri-tone beeps)

378
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,285
Homer.

379
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,829
It's ringing.

380
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,163
(tri-tone beeps)

381
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,292
And I'd like to thank
Low Ball Construction

382
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,503
for building this amazing wall

383
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,965
from 90% recycled material.

384
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,925
(scattered applause)

385
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,594
-I'm so conflicted.
-About what?

386
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,138
Loyal citizens of New Springfield,

387
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,016
you stayed on my side of town

388
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,228
despite a total lack
of hospitals and schools

389
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,980
and a sewage nightmare

390
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,357
that threatens to consume us all.

391
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,650
How do we get our food?

392
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,985
All the roads are blocked.

393
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,069
(murmuring)

394
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,487
Don't worry.

395
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,157
We have plenty of supplies
to get through tomorrow.

396
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,702
And then a wave of disease
should help to...

397
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,870
Hey!

398
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,830
Stop streaming over the wall!

399
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,124
At least wait till I'm through talking.

400
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,709
OK, now, as for food,

401
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,669
the following breeds of dog are edible.

402
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,379
-See ya!
-(Barney) Bye, Homer!

403
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,381
(grunting)

404
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,049
Oh! I can't believe

405
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,552
all those rats fled my town.

406
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,846
I guess it's just us
and the tumbleweeds.

407
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,682
Oh!

408
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,063
BART: Well, Dad,

409
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,815
you're mayor of a ghost town.

410
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,734
Oh, I can't believe

411
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,569
those traitors abandoned us.

412
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,779
They couldn't take one lousy famine.

413
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:06,780
(grunts)

414
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,574
Dad, you're bleeding.

415
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,117
No problem. (grunts)

416
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:16,081
Anyhow, those rats
will come crawling back.

417
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,041
(chuckles)

418
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,752
We've got The Who playing here tonight.

419
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,047
Dad, the arena's in Olde Springfield.

420
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,048
D'oh!

421
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,007
Don't give up, Dad.

422
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,301
Maybe we can get The Who
to play here, instead.

423
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,095
Hey, maybe we could.

424
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,098
But we'll need some liquid persuasion.

425
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,936
(grunts)

426
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,521
Come on, Bart. We're going
to bring back The Who.

427
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,439
(kissing)

428
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,440
(moaning)

429
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,363
(elevator bell dings)

430
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,954
-HOMER: Ohh...
-Can I help you?

431
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:55,955
Uh...

432
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,581
Dad, the chloroform.

433
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,540
Huh?

434
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,458
Oh, right.

435
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,961
I'll give you this bottle
of chloroform

436
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,129
-if you'll take us to The Who.
-D'oh.

437
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,965
Oh, so you want to see
The Who, huh?

438
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,466
Well, I'll take you to The Who.

439
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,176
Here's your Who!

440
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,427
(both grunting)

441
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,264
I thought we fired that guard.

442
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,017
Oh, yeah, right.
I got fired by The Who.

443
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,644
Whatever you say, pal.

444
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,771
(whistles)
Wacko.

445
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,065
Wow, The Who!

446
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,483
(chuckles)

447
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,318
(grunts)
Whoo!

448
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,820
Rock and roll!

449
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,279
(grunts)

450
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,990
What the hell are you doing?

451
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,199
(chuckles) Duh.

452
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,367
Trashing the hotel room.

453
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,577
But we promised
the desk clerk we'd be good.

454
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,621
Yeah, we don't want to lose
our pool privileges.

455
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,539
Whatever.

456
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,041
The point is, I'm Homer Simpson.

457
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,543
The mayor of New Springfield?

458
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,752
That's right.

459
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,046
The crazy mayor of New Springfield?

460
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,589
That's right.

461
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,551
And I implore you to move
your concert to our town.

462
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,094
Don't play Olde Springfield.

463
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:56,015
Or, as it is sometimes known, Sun City.

464
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,349
But we have a handshake agreement

465
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,600
with a concert promoter

466
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,352
and that's a sacred bond.

467
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,187
ALL: Sacred bond.

468
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,274
Come on, what happened
to the angry, defiant Who

469
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,776
of "My generation,"
"Won't get fooled again"

470
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,570
and "Mama's got a squeeze box"?

471
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,113
We know our songs, Homer.

472
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,906
But those Olde Springfield squares

473
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,783
are just going to make you
cut your hair,

474
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,951
turn down your music,

475
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,704
and wear frilly shirts
like Keith Partridge.

476
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,164
Keith Partridge?

477
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,665
Who huddle.

478
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,168
(muttering)

479
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,754
We'll do it.

480
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,213
Yeah!

481
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,715
Just send a cab for us.

482
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,050
Why, is something wrong with your legs?

483
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,385
You're right. The walk will do us good.

484
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,098
I opened for The Who at Woodstock.

485
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,684
I came out in a Beatle wig
with a ukulele.

486
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,270
Hendrix said he almost plotzed.

487
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,772
His exact words.

488
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,691
Oh, I never tire of that story.

489
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,193
Smithers, why did you iron

490
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,486
a crease in these dungarees?

491
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,695
I look like a square.

492
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,073
Uh, that crease is in your leg, sir.

493
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,365
Oh, so it is.

494
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:56,700
Yes...

495
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,827
(all yelling)

496
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,914
Hmm, it's not like The Who to be tardy.

497
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:02,831
I'm worried.

498
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,957
-(music playing)
-What's that?

499
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,585
Argh! 'tis The Who!

500
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,212
By my reckoning,

501
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,340
they're in the scurvy depths
of New Springfield.

502
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,425
Homer stole our rock performance.

503
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,344
That fat, dumb and bald guy

504
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,387
sure plays some real hardball.

505
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,431
Who's ready to riot?

506
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,101
(all yelling angrily)

507
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,394
<i>♪ I won't get to get</i>
<i>what I'm after ♪</i>

508
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,564
<i>♪ Till the day I die ♪</i>

509
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,571
How you doing out there,
New Springfield?

510
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,115
(cheering and applause)

511
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,950
To be honest, it's a little chilly...

512
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:38,867
Ow!

513
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,160
DALTREY: Get out of the way, Marge.

514
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,204
We were expecting
a bigger crowd, Homer.

515
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,289
Oh, don't worry, they'll be here soon

516
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,458
and then they'll see
who's got the better town.

517
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,753
Now, these are the tunes
I want you boys to play.

518
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,963
Wait a minute.

519
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,714
Homer, a lot of these

520
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,508
are grand funk railroad songs.

521
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,093
And we don't know "Pacman fever."

522
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,303
Oh, come on, it plays itself.

523
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,264
<i>♪ A Pacman fever ♪</i>

524
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,890
<i>♪ A doodle-ee-do ♪</i>

525
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,477
<i>♪ It's a-drivin' me</i>
<i>a cra-aa-aazy! ♪</i>

526
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,272
Look, Lisa, daddy's in The Who.

527
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,023
Oh.

528
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,191
(chuckles)

529
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,818
(imitating electric guitar)

530
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:13,777
(singing gibberish)

531
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,821
Ow!

532
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,115
Give us back our concert, Simpson!

533
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,700
So, new Springfield's

534
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,702
looking pretty good now, isn't it?

535
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,328
With our ample parking

536
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,581
and daily Who concerts.

537
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,748
-Daily?
-We'll talk.

538
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,167
Yeah, all right, enough chitchat.

539
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,335
Let's see how you like
flaming garbage!

540
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,629
(all yelling angrily)

541
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,589
(grunting)

542
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,135
(singsong)
Ha, ha, you hit the tire fire.

543
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,261
You'll have to do bet...

544
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,096
Ow! Oh, why me?

545
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,389
(screams)

546
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,684
People, please.

547
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,019
What's all this fighting about?

548
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,313
Apparently, they have
two different area codes.

549
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,439
Well, I'll be chuggered.

550
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,732
That's a sticky wicket.

551
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,192
Why not just buy telephones

552
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,443
with auto ring-up?

553
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,403
Or, as you yanks call it,
"speed-dial."

554
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,363
(intrigued murmuring)

555
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,240
Radio shack has some great ones.

556
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,491
Ah, says you.

557
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,619
"Magic bus".

558
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,953
ALL: Yeah, "Magic bus"!

559
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,331
OK, we'll play "Magic bus"

560
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,041
if you tear down this wall.

561
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,336
"Pinball wizard"!

562
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,379
Oh, hell, I'll do it myself.

563
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,845
(power chord)

564
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,931
(plays "Won't get fooled again")

565
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,895
(all cheering)

566
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,647

567
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:37,194

569
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,988
Well, Marge,

570
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,866
looks like
your insane experiment is over.

571
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,409
My experiment?

572
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,703
You're the one who came up
with this whole idea...

573
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,790

574
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,085

579
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,737
(whimpers)

580
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,371
(theme music playing)

581
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,827
-(tri-tone beeping)
-Shh!

582
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,663
(tri-tone beeping continues)

583
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,166
