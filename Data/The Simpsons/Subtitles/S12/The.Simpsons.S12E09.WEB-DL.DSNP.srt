(tires screeching)

10
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,173
Animation is so great.

11
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,300
It's way better than

12
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,260
whatever the alternative is.

13
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,097
Seems like animated shows are everywhere,

14
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,973
or were last year.

15
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,851
Cool. Japanimation.

21
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,411
Your laugh is incorrect, Meganaut!

Activate prawn power!

(grunts, screaming)

25
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,351
Man, that Princess Tempura
is one heck of a transformazoid.

26
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,061
Wait, I'm confused.

27
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,522
Why was a wolf shooting a web?

28
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,440
Cartoons don't have to make sense.

29
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,109
He's right, you know.

30
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,654
Daddy, are you sure it's OK
for us to watch cartoons?

31
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,990
Mm-hmm. This one's fine and dandy, Roddy.

32
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,742
It's approved by a council
of Presbylutheran ministers.

33
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,995
(music playing)

34
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,416
Whatcha making there, Gravey?

35
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,835
It's a pipe bomb, Jobriath,

36
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,087
for to blow up planned parenthood.

37
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,631
I don't know, Gravey.

38
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,718
I'm sick of your lack of faith.

39
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,469
Hmm?

40
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,307
But, Gravey...

41
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,434
-(loud explosion)
-(organ music playing)

42
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,894
BOTH: Yay!

43
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,023
And then, I created the voice
of Yellow-Bellied Yak.

44
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,733
(as cowardly lion)
All I need is some courage.

45
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:12,984
Courage, I tell you.

46
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,111
Excuse me, but isn't that voice

47
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,280
very similar to the Cowardly Lion?

48
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,866
Also, sir, your Loudmouth Leopard

49
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,743
is a rip-off of Jackie Gleason.

50
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,537
(as Jackie Gleason)
Hamina, hamina, hamina, hamina.

51
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,832
And Klutzy Kat sounds
exactly like Jerry Lewis

52
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,792
with the stealing and the lawsuit!

53
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,963
And, oh, nice judge, don't hurt
a person with the thing.

54
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,217
(music playing)

55
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,470

56
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,598
(kissing sounds)

57
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,186
(screaming)

58
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,021
DIRECTOR: And... cut!

62
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,322
Here's your smoke, Mr. Itchy.

63
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,990
Thank you, Louie.

64
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,329

65
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:13,044
Mm-hmm! And now,
there's more nico-glycerol.

66
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,462
I don't know what's in them.

67
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,673
I just know I can't stop smoking them.

70
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,142
Wait a minute. Was that cat
making out with that mouse?

71
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,228
'Cause if they were...

72
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,942
Folks, you're about to witness
the exciting new process

73
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,236
of motion-capture animation.

74
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,282
-Now, we'll need a volun--
-HOMER: Pick me! Pick me!

75
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,494
Now, when you move any part of your body,

76
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,664
our furry friend will copy you exactly.

77
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,625
Mmm... Hmm... (chuckles)

82
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,971
Uh, let me see.

83
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,890
(as Don Corleone) I'll make him
an offer he can't refuse.

84
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,767
(as Edith Ann) And that's the truth.

85
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,352

Thank you.

89
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,362
Don't spay or neuter your pets.

90
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,488

Eroding, eroding... Gone!

(embarrassed groaning)

98
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,179
That motion-capture suit is
just what this country needs.

99
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,097
Just think of all the hilarious motions

100
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,767
that are going uncaptured, like this.

101
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,187
(grunting)

102
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,981
See? Now wouldn't you love
to see that move

103
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,025
performed by a cartoon possum?

104
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,362
An opossum capering around like that
would be a smash hit.

105
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,572
That would be the world's
funniest marsupial.

106
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,201
You're right. That suit gizmo
could be worth billions.

107
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,578
And I'm going to get
a piece of the action.

108
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,916
-(car door closes)
-(tires screeching)

109
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,668
So, does he still work here, or what?

110
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,216
I'd like to withdraw my life savings,
please. And hurry!

111
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,343
Uh, sir, this is a joint account.

112
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,678
Uh, you'll need
your wife's signature, too.

113
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,348
Oh! Yes, of course.

114
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,059
Uh, she's behind that plant.

115
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,686
Hello, Marge.

116
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,063

for some candy.

120
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,280
(as Homer) No, no. No candy for you.

121
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,158
(as Lisa) Well, at least
get some candy for yourself.

122
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,452

00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,037

124
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,373
Here's your candy.

125
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,457
So long, sucker!

126
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,751
Uh, sir, your life savings.

127
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,713
Uh, yes, I see that it's in bill form.

128
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,840
Excellent.

129
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,304
I'd like to buy 500 shares
of Animotion Incorporated.

130
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,351
OK. Uh, now before I execute this order,

131
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,937
are you sure you understand
the risks of stock ownership?

132
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,272

180
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,779
You know, Homer, I got
a great way to make money.

181
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,489
I'm a human guinea pig.

182
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,157
You mean, like medical testing?

183
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,244
Yeah, medical, military, chewing stuff.

184
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,204
-Chewing stuff?
-Yeah,

185
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,956
like you chew on a telephone wire

186
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,249
till you get a shock.

187
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,209
Oh, oh, right. OK.

188
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,253
Yeah, but aren't
those experiments dangerous?

189
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,338
Ah, you get a few side effects.

190
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,341
-Are those ears?
-Ow! Not so loud!

191
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,969
Hmm...

192
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,350
First, we'll test this
experimental perfume on you.

193
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,185
It burns! It burns!

194
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,354
-(screaming)
-Hmm...

195
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,816
-We'll call it "Desert Breeze."
-ALL: Mm-hmm.

196
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:12,570
(humming)

197
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,072
That appetite suppressant is amazing.

198
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,284
Homer, you really have
no desire to eat that food?

199
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,245
Food? I'm blind!

200
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,706
(screaming)

201
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,000
Who's going to buy a pill
that makes you blind?

202
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,419
We'll let marketing worry about that.

203
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,464
(grunting)

204
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:34,884
(beeping, buzzing)

205
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,010
D'oh!

206
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,804
D'oh!

207
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,890
Where did that rat come from?

208
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,600
He must have brought it in with him.

209
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,852
-Hmm...
-(buzzes)

210
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,312
Damn it.

211
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,897
Man, is he dumb.

212
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,482
Where do they get these subjects?

213
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,942
He's a little too well-fed to be a wino.

214
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,486
Hey, what's that?

215
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,446
Zoom in on section eight.

216
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,160
Rotate 20 degrees.

217
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,121
(beeping)

218
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,540
(both gasping)

219
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,880
Mr. Simpson, I'm afraid you have a crayon
lodged in your brain.

220
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,424
There's a crayon in my brain?

221
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,512
But I've had thousands of head x-rays.

222
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,514
How come no one ever noticed it before?

223
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,182
Oh, I can answer that.

224
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,142
You see, whenever I pick up an x-ray,

225
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,852
I always hold it like this.

226
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,648
My thumb must have covered up
the crayon every time.

227
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,233
(chuckling)

228
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,068
I'll show myself out.

229
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,028
Do you have any idea
how this might have happened?

230
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,407
Well, I'm not sure,
but it might have happened

231
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,826
when I was six.

232
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,912
Fourteen,

233
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,873
fifteen,

234
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,376
sixteen!

235
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,461
Whoo-hoo!

236
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,673
Oh, I don't feel so good.

237
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,342
(sneezing)

238
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,886
Uh, I think that's all of them.

239
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,972
Mr. Simpson, this could be responsible

240
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,141
for your subnormal intelligence.

241
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,684
Hey, I came here to be drugged,

242
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,061
electrocuted and probed, not insulted.

243
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,105
We could remove the crayon for you.

244
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,691
It could vastly increase your brain power,

245
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,067
or it could possibly kill you.

246
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:19,196
Hmm... increase my killing power, eh?

247
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,240
Let's do it.

248
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,200
-(vehicle approaching)
-(tires screeching)

249
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,995
Oh, Homer, where have you been?

250
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,082
I just underwent a procedure
to increase my IQ 50 points.

251
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,251
-Really?
-And they gave me

252
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,920
this spiffy nerd ensemble, too.

253
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,922
Do you feel smarter?

254
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,759
Is the capital of North Dakota Bismarck?

255
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,219
It is.

256
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,014
I don't believe it.
Say something else smart.

257
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,891
Dr. Joyce Brothers may be well known,

258
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,144
but her psychological
credentials are highly suspect.

259
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,104
It's true!

260
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,689
-Oh!
-(all gasping)

261
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,859
Now, who's up for a trip
to the library tomorrow?

262
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,905
Notice I no longer say
"liberry" or "tomorry."

263
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,157
I'd love to go to the library with you.

264
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,742
It's a date.

265
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,041
Dad, did you read all these books today?

266
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,753
Everything from <i>Hop on Pop</i>
to <i>Death Be Not Proud.</i>

267
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,798
It's so tragic the way they hopped on Pop.

268
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,342
I always dreamed
you'd be my library buddy.

269
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,135
-Get out.
-No, really.

270
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,180
I think books have an amazing
power to bring people together.

271
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,933
Look, even Cletus is checking one out.

272
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,560
Now, hold still.

273
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,897
Nothing cracks a turtle like Leon Uris.

274
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,234
Ow! Dang it! Ow!

275
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,903
-(piano sonata ending)
-ANNOUNCER: <i>That sonata may not be</i>

276
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,321
<i>a Glenn Gould performance,</i>

277
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,491
but I must say it's "good as Gould."

278
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,117
(laughing)

279
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,038
Hey, Flanders, heading for church?

280
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,123
Well, I thought I could
save you a little time.

281
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,084
Ooh, found a new shortcut?

282
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,878
Better. I was working
on a flat tax proposal

283
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,298
and I accidentally proved there's no God.

284
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,467
We'll just see about that.

285
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,054
Uh-oh. Well, maybe he made a mistake.

286
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,431
Nope, it's airtight.

287
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,017
Can't let this little doozy get out.

288
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:18,148
(whistling "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing")

289
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,652
Welcome to the third lecture in our series

290
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,988
on "not putting things up your nose."

291
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,240
Please welcome Homer Simpson.

292
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,325
(sparse applause)

293
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,619
I am here to give hope to the least of you

294
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,289
because we all have a crayon up our nose.

295
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,749
Maybe it's not a crayon made of wax.

296
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,545
-Maybe it's a crayon made of prejudice.
-Question.

297
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,839
-Yes, Nelson.
-A moron says what?

298
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,507
Not being a moron, I wouldn't know.

299
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,467
However... (mumbling)

300
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,636
-What?
-Ladies and gentlemen,

301
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,055
I give you your moron.

302
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,224
-(groans)
-(jeering laughter)

303
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,727
You see, it's cool to be smart.

304
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,814
So be like me, and use your minds.

305
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,691
Paint a painting, sing a song,

306
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,359
and dance a dance.

307
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,737
(cheering)

308
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,197
Thank you. Unfortunately,
due to budget cuts,

309
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,325
we are canceling art, music and dance.

310
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,743
Please evacuate the auditorium

311
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,912
before it's bulldozed into a mini-mall.

312
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,748
-(rumbling)
-(screaming)

313
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,171
So... is that your usual coffee mug?

314
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,715
-Yup.
-Huh. Looks a little bigger.

315
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,593
-It's not.
-(Homer humming)

316
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,679
Whatcha mailing, Homer?

317
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,099
I've compiled a thorough
safety report on this plant.

318
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,060
How come you're not
giving it to Mr. Burns?

319
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,854
I've decided to disintermediate
the local authorities

320
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,941
and send it straight to
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

321
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,943
Yeah, and just in time.

322
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,862
Every day there's more skin on my pillow.

323
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,281
Yeah, it's nice to have
someone with brains

324
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,866
in this nuclear plant.

325
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,743
Homer's the guy who rigged up my pants

326
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,453
with this special codpiece.

327
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,538
-Comfy, isn't it?
-Oh, yeah.

328
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,125
It provides the freedom and protection
I so sorely need.

329
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,460
-(chuckles) Yeah!
-Yeah!

330
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,426
It seems the <i>federales</i>

331
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,221
have been tipped off
by an anonymous whistle-blower.

332
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,597
Mm-hmm.

333
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,684
Now, while the plant
is brought up to code,

334
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,936
-there will be massive layoffs.
-(all gasping)

335
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,729
That is to say, total layoffs.

336
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,981
Toodles.

337
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,024
(indistinct chatter)

338
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,360
(tires squealing)

339
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,406
(groans) Way to put us
out of work, genius.

340
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,409
I can't feed my family with a codpiece.

341
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,745
Hey, you can't hate me.

342
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,539
I'm your better.

343
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,791
Your better!

344
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,961
Ooh, you've really done it
this time, dum-dum.

345
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,129
(moans)

346
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,719
MEN (chanting): Burn! Burn! Burn!

347
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,679
Burn! Burn! Burn!

348
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,180
Effigy, eh?

349
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,182
Yeah, nothing burns like an effigy.

350
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,102
Hey, that's me.

351
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,645
Stop that.

352
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,231
The fire inspector would be appalled.

353
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,859
Don't tell me how to feel. (grunts)

354
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,862
So, you all hate me?

355
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,280
That's right, brainiac.

356
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,656
You cost us our jobs,

357
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,742
which we need for working.

358
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,660
Not to mention driving to.

359
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,037
And I was a lot happier

360
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,581
before I knew Dame Edna was a man.

361
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,790
A lot happier.

362
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,167
You ain't welcome here

363
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,085
no more, smart boy.

364
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,172
Hmm. I'm detecting a distinct strain

365
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,592
of anti-intellectualism
in this tavern-- Ah!

366
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,761
Power off, Einstein.

367
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,890
Lisa, why didn't you warn me?

368
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,435
Being a brain has alienated me
from all my friends.

369
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:45,397
Dad, as intelligence goes up,
happiness often goes down.

370
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,191
In fact, I made a graph.

371
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,818
I make a lot of graphs.

372
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,945
Well, what gets you through the day?

373
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,491
Oh, many things, tai chi, chai tea.

374
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:59,036
But I find, when I can't keep the unhappy
thoughts from swirling in my brain,

375
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,622
the best thing is
usually a nice, long walk.

376
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,917
A walk? That's a really good idea.

377
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,714
Hmm? Hmm...

378
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,511
(all laughing)

379
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,055
<i>Do you take this woman</i>

380
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,099
<i>to be your lawfully wedded wife?</i>

381
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,725
BOTH: <i>I do.</i>

382
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,477
<i>One groom...</i>

383
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,312
<i>Two grooms?</i>

384
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,605
<i>But he...</i>

385
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,940
<i>But you can't...</i>

386
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,858
<i>Oh, my medication.</i>

387
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,610
(groans)

388
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,986
<i>Radical.</i>

389
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,114
<i>Is that your final answer?</i>

390
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,825
(laughing)

391
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,201
I don't understand.

392
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,078
That wasn't funny.

393
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,664
Wait a minute.
Somebody's not laughing here.

394
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,041
-It's him.
-Hey, don't blame me.

395
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,043
This movie is tired and predictable.

396
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,546
You know she's going to
wind up marrying Richard Gere.

397
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,713
(all gasping)

398
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,383
I thought she'd wind up
with that rich snob.

399
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,802
Ably played by Bill Paxton.

400
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,389
It's Bill Pullman, you fool! Ah!

401
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,560
Point out your plot holes elsewhere.

402
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,563
Is there no place for the man

403
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,524
with the 105 IQ?

404
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,085
I'm a Spaulding Gray in a Rick Dees world.

405
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,796
Change me back to the blissful boob I was.

406
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,840
I'm sorry, we don't play God here.

407
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,926
That's ridiculous.
You do nothing but play God.

408
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,637
And I think your octoparrot would agree.

409
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,223
(squawks) Polly shouldn't be. (whistles)

410
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,267
Look, what if we gave you the name

411
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,768
of an unlicensed surgeon?

412
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,562
Oh, that would be heaven.

413
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,190
(stutters) "Moe Szyslak"?

414
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,150
MOE: <i>That's right. I'm a surgeon.</i>

415
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,530
So what do you want here?

416
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,574
Appendectomy? Lipo?

417
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,117
Or... the sampler?

418
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,368
That's very popular.

419
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,579
I want you to stick this crayon

420
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,372
into my brain.

421
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,832
No problem.

422
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,002
The ol' Crayola oblongata.

423
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,886
Ah. Now for a little powder blue.

424
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,349
Oh, no. He wouldn't.

425
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,560
All right. Tell me when I hit
the sweet spot.

426
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,396
Deeper, you pusillanimous pilsener-pusher.

427
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,940
All right, all right.

428
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:37,069
Defense! Uh! Uh! Defense! Uh! Uh!

429
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:40,155
Uh, that's pretty dumb, but, uh...

430
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,407
Extended warranty?

431
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,784
How can I lose?

432
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:44,868
Perfect.

433
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,374
Sweetheart, a missing crayon
could be anywhere.

434
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,210
Who wants lottery tickets?

435
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,462
OK, it's in his brain.

436
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,005
Dad, how could you?

437
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,675
We were connecting
in such a meaningful way.

438
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,218
We were what-what in a what-what?

439
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,678
(sighs)

440
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,555
Yeah, which reminds me, I need a sandwich.

441
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,558
Hey, what's this?

442
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,685
I don't know. Must be something

443
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,520
I wrote before Moe fixed me.

444
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,441
"Lisa, I'm taking the coward's way out,

445
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,361
but before I do, I just want you to know,

446
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:23,865
being smart made me appreciate
how amazing you really are."

447
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,535
-(munching loudly)
-Oh, Dad.

448
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,786
Huh?

449
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,871
Oh, you want a hug.

450
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,291
Well, that I know how to do.

451
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,545
-(grunting and chomping loudly)
-Mmm.

452
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,798
Mmm... ug.

453
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,432
(closing theme playing)

454
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,179
Shh!

455
