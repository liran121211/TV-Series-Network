00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:02,794
(theme music playing)

2
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:06,589
CHORUS: <i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

3
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,935
(bell ringing)

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,233
(whistle blows)

5
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,281
(beeping)

6
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,829
(playing the blues)

7
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,372
(jazzy solo)

8
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,506
(chimes)

9
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,970
(tires screeching)

10
00:00:58,767 --> 00:00:59,851
(honking horn)

11
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,523
D'oh!

12
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,608
(screams)

13
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,817
(tires screeching)

14
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,584
(laughs)

15
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,753
This watermelon won't know what hit it.

16
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,172
I love our Tuesdays together, Dad.

17
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,261
(laughter)

18
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,972
Don't you two have a list of chores to do?

19
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,641
Hey, we just took care of that
dangerous melon

20
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,101
that was threatening our garden.

21
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,644
Yeah, we're heroes.

22
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,562
But where's our parade?

23
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,022
(groans)

24
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,399
HOMER: All right. "Open stuck drawer."

25
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,485
All righty. (grunting)

26
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,947
-It's hopeless.
-Or is it?

27
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,406
Yeah, it's hopeless.

28
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,951
I said, "Or is it?"

29
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:01,204
I said, "It's..." Oh.

30
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,289
(laughs)

31
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,958
Homer, what are you doing?

32
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,626
Listen, do you want the job done right

33
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,086
or do you want it done fast?

34
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,797
Well, like all Americans, fast, but...

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,965
Clear!

36
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,513
You can't argue with results.

37
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,391
BART: Ooh, baby!

38
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,436
(laughs)

39
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,148
-(whimpering)
-Oh, don't worry.

40
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,775
You'll be sleeping in this
beautiful new doghouse.

41
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,153
Target date, January 2007.

42
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,074
(whimpering)

43
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,493
And now, the grand finale.

44
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,329
"Get Lisa's jammed tape out of VCR."

45
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,040
Wait--wait a minute.

46
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,417
There.

47
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,585
Fire in the hole!

48
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,715
It's going to take a lot of fireworks

49
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,091
to clean this place up.

50
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,260
(gasps) What's going on here?

51
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,762
Uh, honey...

52
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,015
there's a point in every father's life

53
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,933
when he blows up his daughter's room.

54
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,352
Oh, yeah? You didn't blow up
Maggie's room.

55
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,979
(explosion)

56
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,565
Oh, Lisa, this must be
a rough time for you.

57
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,359
Do you have any friends
or family you can stay with?

58
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,320
You've ruined all my stuff.

59
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,906
Oh, come on. Tell us how we can
make it up to you.

60
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,991
Hey, pretend it's your birthday!

61
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,451
It is my birthday.

62
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,494
That's the spirit. Now, what do
you want to do?

63
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,496
Well, the book festival starts today...

64
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,540
Anything at all. You name it.

65
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,250
What do you want to do?

66
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,294
HOMER: Stupid Lisa.

67
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,132
Hear ye, hear ye!

68
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,135
One dollar off on all poetry books!

69
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,386
(crowd clamoring)

70
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:44,015
(sobs) Their hands were everywhere.

71
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,434
REVEREND LOVEJOY: Hello, Simpsons.

72
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,686
Care to try a sample
from my new cookbook--

73
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,939
<i>Someone's in the Kitchen with Jesus?</i>

74
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,194
Mm, these stigmuffins are to die for!

75
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,695
Oh, if you like that, you should try

76
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,156
Mary Magdalene's chocolate orgasm.

77
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,574
Ooh, OK.

78
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,911
-(squirts)
-(grunts)

79
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,290
So, Mr. King, what tale of horror

80
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,417
and the macabre are you working on now?

81
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,586
Oh, I don't feel like
writing horror right now.

82
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,296
Oh, that's too bad.

83
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,966
I'm working on a biography
of Benjamin Franklin.

84
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,133
He's a fascinating man.

85
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,510
He discovered electricity

86
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,387
and used it to torture small animals

87
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,888
and Green Mountain men.

88
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,807
And that key he tied to the end of a kite?

89
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,975
(thunder crashing)

90
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,018
It opened <i>The Gates of Hell!</i>

91
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,855
Well, let me know when
you get back to horror.

92
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,065
Will do.

93
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,154
Hi. With my Info Cram 6000,

94
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,990
you can absorb books instantly

95
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,867
by attaching this electrode
to the brain pan

96
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,204
and this one to the loi-ns.

97
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,330
(electricity crackling)

98
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,749
Tolstoy... Searing... Brain...

99
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,210
With my diet you can eat all you want

100
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,795
any time you want.

101
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,255
And you lose weight?

102
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,340
Uh, you might. It's a free country.

103
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,930
Finally, books for today's busy idiot.

104
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,765
<i>Network Programming for Dummies.</i>

105
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,183
<i>Christianity for Dummies.</i>

106
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,810
Mo-- <i>Moby Dick?</i>

107
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,021
"Call me Ishmael, dummy."

108
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,731
How did you write all these books?

109
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,441
Uh, I don't know.

110
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,735
Me got to go to bank now.

111
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:23,865
Look, Maggie. Christopher Walken's
reading <i>Goodnight, Moon.</i>

112
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,575
"Good night, room.

113
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,577
Good night, moon.

114
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,455
Good night, cow jumping over the moon."

115
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,415
(children whimpering)

116
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,917
Please, children, scootch closer.

117
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,795
Don't make me tell you again
about the scootching.

118
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,756
You in the red, chop-chop.

119
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,507
-(children whimpering)
-Hmm.

120
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:48,222
(laughs) Eh.

121
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,516
All right, does anyone
have a question for our panel

122
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,602
that's not about how much money they make?

123
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,272
Uh, yeah. I'm a techno-thriller junkie,
and I'd like to know,

124
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,900
is the B-2 Bomber more
detectable when it rains?

125
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,569
-Oh-ho. What do you think, Tom Clancy?
-Well, the B-2...

126
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,488
No, no, I was asking Maya Angelou.

127
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,657
The ebony fighter awakens

128
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,910
dappled with the dewy beads of morn.

129
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,495
Maya Angelou is black?

130
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,372
It is a Mach 5 child

131
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,165
forever bound to suckle

132
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,417
from the shriveled breast of Congress.

133
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,504
Oh, Maya, you're a national treasure.

134
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,172
(mic feedback sound)

135
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,424
Ms. Tan, I loved <i>The Joy Luck Club.</i>

136
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,426
It really showed me
how the mother-daughter bond

137
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,886
could triumph over adversity.

138
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,888
No, that's not what I meant at all.

139
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,431
You couldn't have gotten it more wrong.

140
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,600
-But...
-Please, just sit down.

141
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,935
I'm embarrassed for both of us.

142
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,146
(moans softly)

143
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,523
(gasps)

144
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,982
Ew!

145
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,447
(laughs) Book writing.

146
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,573
What a scam, huh?

147
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,534
It's only 20 pages long.

148
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,119
And this guy wrote it for me.

149
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,162
-What's your name again?
-John Updike.

150
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,540
Whoa, whoa! I didn't ask
for your life story.

151
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,042
So, you really know Krusty?

152
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,377
What's he like?

153
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,003
Oh, he's wonderful.

154
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,256
He would do anything for his fans.

155
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,257
KRUSTY: Hurry up, kid.

156
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,302
-Name?
-Hey, it's me, Bart.

157
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,598
-Your biggest fan.
-Hey, good for you, 'cause I wanna...

158
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,101
know that all my fans
are all... (mumbling)

159
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,687
"K the C"?

160
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,897
Hey, this pen's got to last me all day.

161
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,358
Now, if you could
up, bup, bup, bup, bup! Yeah.

162
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,944
-Name?
-My name is Sophie.

163
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,362
Hey, good luck with that.

164
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,405
I'm your daughter.

165
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,865
What?

166
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,075
I finally found my daddy.

167
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,454
Ohh... I think I just seltzered myself.

168
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,622
-(laughs)
-Shut up, Updike!

169
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,503
Listen, honey, a lot of kids

170
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,005
think of me as their daddy,

171
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,841
but I'm just a simple TV legend.

172
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,509
Here, have a keychain.

173
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,303
No, I'm sure you're my father.

174
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,180
You met my mom during the Gulf War.

175
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,974
Oh. Was your mother
an Israeli flight attendant?

176
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,642
-No.
-Cokie Roberts?

177
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,227
No, she was a soldier.

178
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,730
Chestnut brown hair, kind of shy,

179
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,440
thirty-two confirmed kills.

180
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:06,110
Oh-ho-ho! Oh, boy...
Now it's coming back to me.

181
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,822
-(applause)
-(drum roll)

182
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,365
Saddam Hussein?

183
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,452
They should call him
"so damn insane." Ha ha--

184
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,580
Hey, you're just fanning
the flames of hatred.

185
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,332
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

186
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,835
Now, just when you thought
the desert couldn't get any hotter,

187
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,422
it's the Cincinnati Bengal cheerleaders!

188
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,425
Hey, I can't look at that.
I have a girlfriend back home.

189
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,552
This is an insult to our Muslim hosts.

190
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:35,097
KRUSTY: <i>During the show,</i>
<i>a desert wind kicked up.</i>

191
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,266
(wind whooshing)

192
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,728
<i>I sought shelter in a nearby tent.</i>

193
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,314
(gasps)

194
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,107
<i>There was your mother</i>

195
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,110
<i>looking like a beautiful mirage.</i>

196
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,738
<i>Maybe it was the anthrax in the air.</i>

197
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,115
<i>Maybe it was the fact</i>
<i>the Arab women weren't biting.</i>

198
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:57,119
<i>Whatever it was, it was magic.</i>

199
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,294
<i>We slept late</i>
<i>into the morning, and then...</i>

200
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,463
My God, I'm late for my mission!

201
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,383
Here's your mission--
get down with the clown!

202
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,385
-Oh, come on, baby.
-No, not now!

203
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,178
I'm supposed to assassinate Saddam.

204
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,264
Wait a minute, you can't kill Saddam.

205
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,765
He's half my act!

206
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,650
Oh, stop.

207
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,943
No!

208
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,411
(crowd whining)

209
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,122
I just saved my baseball bit.

210
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:46,294
Who's Sayin's on first,
Iya Tol'ya's on second, and...

211
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,462
-You stupid clown!
-(grunting)

212
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,549
When I came to, she was gone

213
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,593
and the war had been over
for eight months.

214
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,553
Anyway, how'd you finally find me?

215
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,389
All my mom ever said was my father was
some pathetic clown.

216
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,891
So, I typed "pathetic clown"
into a search engine

217
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,310
and your name popped right up.

218
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,770
-(car horn honks)
-It's Mom.

219
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,315
Hey, how you been? Remember me?

220
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,649
(engine revs up)

221
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,860
Uh... You better get going.

222
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,820
It was nice meeting you.
Thanks for coming out.

223
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:16,699
But I was hoping maybe
we could do some stuff together

224
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,659
like go to the beach and junk.

225
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,536
Look, you're a sweet kid,

226
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,997
but I'm not exactly father material.

227
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,874
I curse, I gamble,

228
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,876
I pick fights with homeless people,

229
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,128
I... What's wrong with your eyes?

230
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,672
You need a Claritin or something?

231
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,758
Oh, all right.

232
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,053
You get one trip to the beach,
with my assistant.

233
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,804
-(sighs)
-OK, I'll take you.

234
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,306
Yay!

235
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,601
Dear Lord, bless this humble meal.

236
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,561
And did you hear about Krusty?

237
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,188
Whoo, man.

238
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,191
I mean, I knew he was a player,
but, geez, a kid?

239
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,318
Homer, that's not a prayer. That's gossip.

240
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,196
Fine, I'll just discuss heavenly matters.

241
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,073
So, how's Maude Flanders doing up there?

242
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,282
Is she playing the field?

243
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,284
Ooh, yeah, really?

244
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,577
All those guys?

245
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,246
-Amen.
-(Marge groans)

246
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,751
(humming)

247
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,760
OK, kid, there's the water.

248
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,887
-Knock yourself out.
-Come on, Dad.

249
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,098
Let's go bodysurfing or boogie boarding.

250
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,392
Listen, kid, I'm not the kind of dad

251
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,851
who, you know, does things

252
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,853
or says stuff, or looks at you.

253
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,814
But the love is there.

254
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,899
Where are you? Give Daddy a clue.

255
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,819
Oh, that's my girl.

256
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,529
OK, you just sit there

257
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,489
and I'll throw the Frisbee to you.

258
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,617
Oh, I got to sit up now?

259
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,036
Oh! What am I, Baryshnikov?

260
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,497
Oh! (laughs)

261
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,124
Hey, you beat me.

262
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,501
What a great day we've had, huh?

263
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,253
You know... for a clown,

264
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,171
you're not really a lot of fun.

265
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,256
(Krusty groans)

266
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,549
(Sophie sighs)

267
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,802
Boy, fatherhood is one tough gig.

268
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,887
I don't get how other guys do it.

269
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,141
Ready? Switch!

270
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,226
(kids giggling)

271
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,644
Hey, careful, boys.

272
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,813
That arch is looking a little Romanesque.

273
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,940
Sorry, Daddy. How should I punish myself?

274
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,445
No, son. You let them finish,
then you smash it.

275
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,529
That's a good boy.

276
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,114
Mush, Homer, mush!

277
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,616
-Catch, Dad! Catch!
-Oh!

278
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,161
OK, that stings Daddy's eyes, honey.

279
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,914
Hmm, I think I found my mentor.

280
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,083
-Heads up!
-KRUSTY: You know, Homer,

281
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,627
I've spent my whole life entertaining kids

282
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,047
and I just realized
I don't know the first thing about them.

283
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:40,718
Well, I won't lie. Fatherhood isn't easy,
like motherhood,

284
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,429
but I wouldn't trade it for anything...

285
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,097
except for some mag wheels.

286
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,266
Oh, man, that would be sweet.

287
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,226
LISA: Dad! Dad!

288
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,605
Just a second, honey,
Daddy's on his high horse.

289
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,315
Dad!

290
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,108
Yeah, I'm watching, honey.

291
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,777
Nice cannonball.

292
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,238
Anywho, the key to fathering
is don't overthink

293
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,991
'cause overthinking is, um...

294
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,451
What were we talking about?

295
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,453

Kid, I gotta admit

you're starting to grow on me.

309
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,736
Same here, Dad.

310
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,947
It's nice that you don't
always have to be on.

311
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,658
I thought I was on! When was I off?

312
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,493
That bit about the tide pool?

313
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,454
I tell you, it killed at
Jacques Cousteau's funeral.

314
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,789
Dad, relax.

315
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,666
Just enjoy the sunset.

316
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,377
(plays solemn classical music)

317
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,295
Hey, I know that song.

318
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,549
My dad used to play that when I was a boy.

319
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:05,177
-(sniffles) It's beautiful.
-Do you play?

320
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,389
No, I guess musical talent
skips a generation,

321
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,015
like diabetes.

322
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,892
You might want to watch out for that, too.

323
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,478
SOPHIE: Mom, I had the best time!

324
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,689
Can Dad come in for milk and cookies?

325
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,315
Why, I'd love to... Whoa!

326
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,067

00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,072
Oskar Homolka! (nervous chuckle)

329
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,284
That's OK. I think I'll go
somewhere friendlier

330
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,829
like beautiful Downtown Grozny!
Ha ha ha!

331
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:32,913
Zoom.

332
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,792
My little girl's sharp as a tack.

333
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,961
I tried the "Got your nose" bit on her--

334
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,796
didn't fool her for a second.

335
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,923
My uncle still has my nose.

336
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,968
Hmm. (groans)

337
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,012
Oh... (squeals of delight)

338
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,181
Oh, what a lousy hand.

339
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,684
-I'll stand.
-I raise. Two G's.

340
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,436
-I'm out.
-Fold-a-rama.

341
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,062
Can we make this hand high-low?

342
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,480
-No.
-I fold.

343
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,609
Krusty, are you in, or are you out?

344
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,611
Oh, man, I'm totally tapped.

345
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,279
Would you consider taking my Rolex?

346
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,947
You mean, this one?

347
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,365
Oh, yeah, right.

348
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,950
Just let me go to my car.

357
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,475
Best hand of my life, and I can't even--

358
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:38,520
Huh? Sophie's violin? Oh, no, I couldn't.

362
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,989
Hmm.

363
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,616
(strumming)

364
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,285
(squeaking)

365
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,288
Well, it won't bring much cash,

366
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,041
but its sentimental value
is through the roof.

367
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,584
It is acceptable.

368
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,253
Then I'm in, and I call!

369
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,672
Four aces.

370
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,758
-Read them and--
-Straight flush.

371
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,595
Oh, no! No!

372
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,013
You can't!

373
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,848
My daughter will never forgive me!

374
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,351
(humming)

375
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,189
Oh, wait. Now I can do it for real.

376
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,234
(plays solemn classical music)

377
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,495
(plays snappy ending)

378
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,458
Hee!

379
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,129
(doorbell rings)

380
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,507
-Hey, hey, Dad.
-Hey, hey!

381
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,925
Now, look, Sophie.

382
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,552
I know you think your daddy's perfect...

383
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,054
-No, I don't.
-...but I did a bad thing.

384
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,223
I lost your violin in a poker game.

385
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,100
-You what?
-But don't worry.

386
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,144
I got you an even better one.

387
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,770
This is a ukulele.

388
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,232
Yeah, the thinking
man's violin. Check it out.

392
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,489
But, honey, I... (stammering)

393
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,075
I can't believe you would
gamble with something

394
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,660
that meant so much to me.

395
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,288
Wait. Time out.

396
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,790
Four aces is not a gamble.

397
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,709
Mom was right.

398
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,753
I was better off not knowing you.

399
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,422

(speaks in Spanish)

404
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,935
I'm all for ethnic diversity,
but this is just pandering.

405
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,646
Maybe so, but Dawson's going to be bummed.

406
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,564
(door opens)

407
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,484
You got to help me.
My daughter found out I'm a jerk.

408
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,237
Oh, Krusty, I'm sure she just
needs time to get used to you.

409
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,740
Marge, may I play
devil's advocate for a moment?

410
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,742
-Sure. Go ahead.
-(Homer grunting)

411
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,452
Come on, get in there!

412
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,204
-(buzzer sounding)
-D'oh!

413
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,622
Stupid game.

414
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,290
Now, what were we talking about?

415
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,793
-My daughter's violin.
-Oh, right.

416
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,628
Why don't we just break
into fat Tony's compound

417
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,962
and get it back?

418
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,924
Really? You'd help me take on the mob?

419
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:15,427
For a casual acquaintance
like you? Absolutely.

420
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,818
It's some kind of mafia summit.

421
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,403
Every mob family in the country's here.

422
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,364
The Cuomos, the Travoltas,

423
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,117
the Lasordas, the Boy-ar-dees...

424
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,409
This is perfect.

425
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,703
If I know fat Tony, which I don't,

426
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,289
he'll be distracted by his hosting duties.

427
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,874
-Come on.
-(thuds)

428
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,462
(chuckling)

429
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,630
Idiots.

430
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,176
(Homer whimpering)

431
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,429
Hey, I heard there's
a lunar eclipse tonight.

432
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,722
Maybe we should look up.

433
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,058
Nah. For me, it's solar or nothing.

434
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,393
(both sighing)

435
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,770
(grunts)

436
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,439
Welcome to my home.

437
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,150
To answer your first question,

438
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,277
yes, we do have pasta.

439
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,696
Hey, all right! I like pasta. That's good.

440
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,365
If you need money laundered,
just set it outside your door.

441
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,616
You can pick it up in the morning.

442
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,201
Whoa, hey!

443
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,244
Beautiful.

444
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,454
Now, some unpleasant news.

445
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,709
I have learned that someone
in this room is a squealer.

446
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,419
We've narrowed it down to either

447
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,753
Johnny Tightlips

448
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,255
or Frankie the Squealer.

449
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,215
OK, it's me. I can't help it.

450
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,592
I just like squealing.

451
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,093
It makes me feel big.

452
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,344
All right, come on, you're history.

453
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,684
That violin's got to be
around here somewhere.

454
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,644
(fists pounding)

455
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,855
-Had enough, Squealer?
-(spitting)

456
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,857
Did you know fat Tony's
real name is Marion?

457
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,525
You just don't get it, do you?

458
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,902
(fists pounding)

459
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,699
KRUSTY: Bingo!

460
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,245
-D'oh!
-D'oh!

461
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,290
Oh, it's going to take forever
to go through all these.

462
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,083
I have a plan.

463
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,045
Well, that didn't work.

464
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,422
LOUIE: Hey, legs,
let's go jump on Tony's bed.

465
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,090
-LOUIE: Sure. BOTH: Ahh. Uh-oh.

466
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,967
We got to get out of here.
Just take them all!

467
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,385
Then it's decided.

468
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,721
Our website name will be crime.org.

469
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,223
I think we're in the clear.

470
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,974
-(clears throat)
-(both gasp)

471
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,768

473
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,611
Homer, I've got it!

474
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,613
Johnny Tightlips, where'd they hit you?

475
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,782
-I ain't saying nothing.
-But what do I tell the doctor?

476
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,325
Tell him to suck a lemon.

477
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,703
(violin playing "Twinkle,
Twinkle Little Star")

478
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,538
(gasps excitedly)

479
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,999
(gasps loudly)

480
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,167
Hey!

481
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,628
You did it!

482
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,129
You got it back.

483
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,090
Thanks, Dad.

484
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,842
"Dad." That still sounds weird to me,

485
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,803
but I'm glad we're friends again.

486
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,304
(gasps)

487
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,890
And you've lined the case with money.

488
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,768
Small bills, unmarked and non-sequential.

489
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,144
Holy Simoleons!

490
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,355
There must be five grand in there...

491
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,608
oh, which I intentionally
put in there for you,

492
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,779
you... you lucky little <i>hamantashen.</i>

493
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:24,074
Come on, how about a tune for the old man?

497
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,876
-All right, fair enough.
-Oh, OK.

498
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,877
-Class act.
-Sorry--

499
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,254
you're such jerks!
