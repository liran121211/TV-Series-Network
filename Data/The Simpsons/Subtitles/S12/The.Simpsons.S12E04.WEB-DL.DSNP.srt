00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,586
Thank you. This planet needs
every friend it can get.

186
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,338
Oh, the Earth is the best.

187
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,131
That's why I'm a vegetarian.

188
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,717
(chuckles) Well, that's a start.

189
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,345
Oh, well, um, I was thinking
of going vegan.

190
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,805
(chuckles) I'm a level-five vegan.

191
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,349
I won't eat anything that casts a shadow.

192
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,517
Wow.

193
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,854
Um, I started an organic compost pile
at home.

194
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,356
Only at home?

195
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,774
You mean you don't pocket-mulch?

196
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,110
Oh, it's so decomposed.

197
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,071
Do you think I could join Dirt First?

198
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:53,616
Well, we might have an opening
at the poser level.

199
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,368
Oh, thank you, thank you!

200
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,248
Have a good time at your hippie club.

201
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,916
You've welcome to come, too.

202
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,461
No, I like to save
the environment my own way.

203
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,217
(tires squealing)

204
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,761
HOMER: Mmm... donuts.

205
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,514
I am happy to report
we've succeeded in blocking

206
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,057
the St. Patrick's Day Parade,

207
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,476
which every year steps on several lizards.

208
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,103
-Right on!
-Death to humans!

209
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,187
Don't celebrate yet.

210
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,190
The mayor had a secret tree auction
last night.

211
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,944
<i>What am I bid for the logging rights</i>

212
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,989
<i>to Springfield's oldest redwood tree?</i>

213
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,492
<i>$30,000 to make cages</i>
<i>for animal experimentation.</i>

214
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,911
<i>$50,000 for Thai menus.</i>

215
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,581
<i>Daughter on wait list at Bennington.</i>

216
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,417
<i>100,000 simoleons</i>

217
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,670
<i>to make the world's first</i>
<i>drive-through humidor.</i>

218
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,464
<i>Sold to the rich Texan.</i>

219
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:54,218
<i>Yee-haw! Yippi-i-ki-yi-yay!</i>

220
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,345
<i>Whoo, doggies!</i>

221
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,014
(whooping)

222
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,724
Thanks to Caleb for the tape.

223
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,475
How'd you sneak that camera in?

224
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,269
I got my ways.

225
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,896
They can't cut down that sequoia

226
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,732
if one of us is living in it.

227
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,983
Any volunteers?

228
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:09,984
I'll do it!

229
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,277
Man, I am so there!

230
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,445
Me, me, me.

231
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,946
Whoa, hold on.

232
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,407
Once you're up there, you can't come down.

233
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,744
Not for a Phish concert,
not even for Burning Man.

234
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,120
(subdued murmuring)

235
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,955
Well, someone will hear the call...

236
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,794
and whoever does will have
a place in my heart.

237
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,880
Mm-hmm. (sighs)

238
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,508
Sheesh, look at these refugees.

239
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,926
How about a smile?

240
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,846
They've undergone terrible hardships.

241
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,723
Well, moping won't make it better.

242
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,352
Mom, Dad, there's something I have to do.

243
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,062
You're not going to like it,

244
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,230
but I really believe it's the right thing.

245
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,693
Marge, she's going to narc on our stash.

246
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,112
We don't have a stash.

247
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,114
No, of... course not.

248
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,206
(grunts)

249
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,957
(gasps)

250
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,835
Wow.

251
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,840
Oh, I didn't think it would be so high.

252
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,343
Maybe I could just circulate a petition.

253
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,719
(chuckles weakly)

254
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,472
(clucking)

255
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,557
Ooh, I'll show you.

256
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,856
(grunting)

257
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,239
(grunting continues)

258
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,242
(moaning)

259
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,993
(panting)

260
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,330
Well, this looks like
a good place to set up camp.

261
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,543
Wow, what a view.

262
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,842
(vehicles approaching)

263
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,055
Gentlemen, start your chainsaw.

264
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,515
(chainsaws buzzing)

265
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,392
LISA: Not so fast!

266
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,481
Now, you come down from there, missy.

267
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,318
(loudly) I won't come down
till you spare this tree!

268
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,282
Hang in there, Laura!

269
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,033
It's Lisa!

270
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,287
Right. Lisa! You're hard-core!

271
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,206
(softly) Oh, he said I was hard-core.

272
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,250
(yelling)

273
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,045
(grunting)

274
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,964
(tires screeching)

275
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,801
Oh, no! My baby's up there!

276
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,513
It's OK, Mom! I have a safety line.

277
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,640
This is your fault
with your non-threatening

278
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,185
Bobby Sherman-style good looks.

279
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,061
No girl could resist your charms.

280
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,605
This was her choice, Mr. Simpson.

281
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,398
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

282
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,066
I was lost in your eyes.

283
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,653
All right! A care bucket.

284
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,989
(grunting)

285
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,367
Hot Thai soup.

286
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,869
Oh, Bart.

287
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,247
"Dear Lisa, you rock.

288
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,416
Mom is calling rescue agencies.

289
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,295
Dad is building a giant ladder,
but it is of poor quality.

290
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,755
We miss you. Bart."

291
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,215
Ah!

292
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,258
<i>It's day four</i>

293
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,803
<i>for Springfield's "li'lest"</i>
<i>tree hugger. </i>(chuckles)

294
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,138
<i>Excuse me. That's "littlest" tree hugger.</i>

295
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,307
<i>And whether you love or hate her politics,</i>

296
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,018
<i>you've got to go gawk at this crazy idiot.</i>

297
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,520
(thunder cracking)

298
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,689
Oh... Oh, 7:00.

299
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,192
The family's just sitting down to dinner.

300
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,612
Aw...

301
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,988
-(choking)
-(grunting)

302
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,907
You call that saying grace?

303
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,410
(yelling)

304
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,665
(thunder rumbling)

305
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,753
LISA: Oh, now, they're making popcorn

306
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,880
and hanging Christmas stockings

307
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,842
and coloring Easter eggs.

308
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,844
Oh, I can't take it.

309
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,013
Would it be so bad if I just went home
for an hour?

310
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,892
(grunting) Whoa.

311
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,067
Don't worry, I'll be right back. (kissing)

312
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,945
Ew, someone's been marking
their territory.

313
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,492
Hey, everybody, I'm...

314
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,828
(snoring)

315
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,956
Aw...

316
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,502
I'll just rest here for a minute.

317
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,964
(sighs)

318
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,511
(birds twittering)

319
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,763
(Maggie babbling)

320
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,100
(gasps) Oh.

321
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,102
Oh, it's morning. I got to get back.

322
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,610
(gasps)

323
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,070
Oh, no!

324
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,744
Oh, Mom, those loggers
chopped down the tree.

325
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,913
Why did I have to leave my post?

326
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,165
Now, honey, let's turn on the news

327
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,833
and forget our troubles.

328
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,045
<i>Springfield's oldest resident has died.</i>

329
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:24,173
<i>No, it wasn't Mr. Burns.</i>

330
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,300
<i>It was this majestic, old redwood</i>

331
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,510
<i>which was brutally cut down last night.</i>

332
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,596
(sighs)

333
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,681
<i>Not by loggers, but by lightning.</i>

334
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,058
Lightning?

335
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,142
(relieved sigh)

336
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,644
At least, it wasn't my fault.

337
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,313
<i>Lightning attracted by this metal bucket.</i>

338
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,481
(groans)

339
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,982
<i>Still unknown is the fate</i>

340
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,817
<i>of tree-sitter Lisa Simpson.</i>

341
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,153
<i>I'm afraid it doesn't look good, Kent.</i>

342
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,614
<i>We found her sleeping bag right here.</i>

343
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,990
<i>Our working theory is that</i>

344
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,951
<i>the lightning exploded her.</i>

345
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,078
<i>-Back to you, Kent.</i>
<i>-You don't get to say that.</i>

346
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,081
KENT: <i>Good-bye, Lisa. We'll miss you.</i>

347
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,249
Oh, no! Lisa's gone!

348
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,377
And nothing will bring her back!

349
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,378
(sobs)

350
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,046
Unless...

351
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,464
Dad! I'm not dead.

352
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,217
Oh, praise God! You're alive!

353
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,510
Unless...

354
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:13,347
Oh, my! They made you a shrine.

355
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,642
<i>I loved Lisa Simpson.</i>

356
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,560
<i>Loved her like shrub</i>

357
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,981
<i>and I would give anything</i>
<i>to see her sweet face again.</i>

358
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,857
Oh. (giggling)

359
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,860
<i>But in death,</i>
<i>she will do more for our cause</i>

360
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,071
<i>than she ever could've done in life.</i>

361
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,949
<i>Uh-huh. In Texas, we do tragedy right.</i>

362
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,451
<i>That's why, in memory</i>
<i>of that poor little girl,</i>

363
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,620
<i>I'm turning this entire forest</i>

364
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,540
<i>into the Lisa Simpson Wilderness Preserve.</i>

365
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,874
<i>We won, Lisa.</i>

366
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,876
<i>We finally won.</i>

367
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,380
<i>This... is for you.</i>

368
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,970
(gasps) He cut off his favorite dread.

369
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,014
(clicks TV off) We have to tell them

370
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,682
you're not dead.

371
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,477
No, Mom! It's a memorial forest now.

372
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,771
If I'm alive, they'll cut it down.

373
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,858
You are not pretending
to be dead, young lady.

374
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,818
This family has had nothing but bad luck

375
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,820
-when it comes to farce.
-(doorbell rings)

376
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,238
Homer, it's Neddy!

377
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,365
I baked you a little something
to ease the pain.

378
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,617
Oh! (groaning)

379
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,744
Must hide Lisa.

380
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,539
(falsetto) Come in!

381
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,585
So, Bart, our school policy
is to give students

382
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,837
in your situation... straight A's.

383
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,338
Get out! What's the catch?

384
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,424
The tragic loss of your sister.

385
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,218
Ah, yes. Ghastly business, that.

386
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,970
(tires screeching)

387
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,059
Grieving father, coming through.

388
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,436
Homer, uh, booze is on the house,

389
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,938
seeing as how Lisa is, um...

390
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,274
How do I put this, uh...

391
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,486
riding the midnight train to Slab City.

392
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,321
Thanks for the beer, Moe.

393
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,990
But before Lisa died, she made this tape

394
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,325
that I think you should hear.

395
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,369
LISA: <i>Dear Moe, if anything should</i>
<i>ever happen to me,</i>

396
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,164
<i>I want you to tear up my Dad's tab</i>

397
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,501
<i>and pour cocktail onions... Dad, I can't--</i>

398
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,835
HOMER (on tape): <i>Read it!</i>

399
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,171
LISA: <i>...pour cocktail onions</i>

400
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,798
<i>down your pants.</i>

401
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:14,301
Well, I ain't never said no
to a dead girl yet.

402
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,805
(groans)

403
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,933
And now Branford Marsalis will play

404
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,185
using Lisa's very own saxophone.

405
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,269
Don't touch it!

406
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,230
They can clone her from the spit!

407
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,231
(sobbing)

408
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,690
Good luck, Milhouse.

409
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,443
And finally, an exciting announcement

410
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,404
from our good friends at Omni-Pave.

411
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,158
Folks, last night, the dear, departed Lisa
came to me in a dream.

412
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:42,204
She told me her fondest wish
was that this forest

413
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,164
would become the world's rootin'est,

414
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,709
tootin'est, pollutin'est amusement park!

415
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,503
(shocked murmurs)

416
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,255
APU: It was Lisa's dream.

417
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,800
You promised us a nature preserve.

418
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,426
Now, don't you fret.

419
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,763
We're sensitive to all your eco concerns.

420
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,224
-(chainsaw buzzing)
-That's it, boys.

421
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,309
The gift shop will go right there.

422
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,562
Yee-haw! Cut it down! (laughs)

423
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,148
-LISA: No!
-(crowd murmuring)

424
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,357
(all gasping)

425
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,028
(stuttering) A girl!

426
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,822
I'm not dead.

427
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,741
And neither is my sense of moral outrage.

428
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,410
Oh, here we go.

429
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,120
Sir, have you no shame?

430
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,705
Clearly, I don't.

431
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,207
(chittering)

432
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,085
Now get your heinie off of Lisa Land.

433
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,754
A redwood is not a promotional tool.

434
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,260
Good Lord! He's cutting the guy-wires.

435
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,014
(crackling)

436
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,891
(tree creaking)

437
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,268
(screaming)

438
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,895
(crowd clamoring)

439
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,984
(cheering)

440
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,903
Nice work, tree.

441
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,780
Now, return to me.

442
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,699
What?

443
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,702
Oh, right. I don't have superpowers...

444
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,953
just yet.

445
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,163
Sweet!

446
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,165
It's headed for the business district.

447
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,462
Not my company!

448
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,592
(screams)

449
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,846
(glass shattering)

450
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,640
No!

451
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,434
It was Finger Ling-Ling Good!

452
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,355
-(screams)
-(glass shattering)

453
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,607
ALL: No!

454
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,150
Yee-haw!

455
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,445
Score one for the bad guys! (laughs)

456
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,741
Hey, Lisa.

457
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,202
Aw, Jesse, they locked you up again.

458
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,454
Yeah, but I'm still fighting
for the Earth.

459
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,831
I even got them to install
a solar-powered electric chair.

460
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,209
Dude, we've been here all morning.

461
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,128
Could you at least re-moisten
my head sponge?

462
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,214
Well, I'll write you letters

463
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,800
on rice paper, with a soy pencil.

464
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,218
Aw, you're sweet.

465
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,220
-(kisses)
-(giddy sigh)

466
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,638
Did they ever stop the log?

467
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,639
Not yet.

468
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,890
What's up with that?

469
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,976
