1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,837
(thunder rumbling)

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,840
(grunting)

3
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:08,800
(theme music playing)

4
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,344
(laughing)

5
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,514
(grunts)

6
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:22,772
Hmm.

7
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,697
(laughing)

8
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,269
Hey, who cut out <i>Beetle Bailey?</i>

9
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,937
I need my Miss Buxley fix.

10
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,231
I don't like you ogling her.

11
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,566
Why don't you read <i>Cathy?</i>

12
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,068
She's hilarious.

13
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,444
Ah, too much baggage.

14
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,529
Ooh, my horoscope.

15
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,990
"Taurus: Today you will die."

16
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,075
-What?
-(gasps)

17
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,659
"And you may get a compliment

18
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,703
from an attractive coworker."

19
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:19,704
Lenny?

20
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,498
It really says "die"?

21
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,250
That sounds unusually
specific for a horoscope.

22
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,628
Mmm, maybe I better check mine.

23
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,089
"Today your husband will die."

24
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,549
(gasps) Homer, I'm scared.

25
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,426
Ooh, scary newspaper.

26
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,011
Don't hurt me, horoscope.

27
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,180
I'm afraid... Ow! Oh!

28
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,515
Paper cut! Paper cut!

29
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,186
(screams)

30
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,187
Missed me!

31
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,688
Stupid horoscope.

32
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,571
Ha-ha-ha... Stupid horoscope.

33
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,281
(rattling)

34
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,575
(grunts)

35
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,701
(chuckles)

36
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,078
Clupid bloropope.

37
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,999
Homer, if I may compliment you...

38
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,960
Yes, go on.

39
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,003
That is one handsome rattlesnake.

40
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,130
You got biting your arm there.

41
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,339
Yeah, that's quite fetching.

42
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,507
But, uh, aren't you worried

43
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,633
about the deadliness?

44
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,009
No, he'll get tired of biting

45
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,177
in an hour or so.

46
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,596
Snakes, nature's quitters.

47
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,850
That horoscope was baloney.

48
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,977
Nothing happened except
for the pickax in my head,

49
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,146
the rattlesnake bite
and the testicle thing.

50
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,147
What's for dessert?

51
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,481
No dessert until you eat

52
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,649
your broccoli.

53
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,276
Oh... fine.

54
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,070
(grunts)

55
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,411
Mm, another broccoli-related death.

56
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,495
But I thought broccoli was...

57
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,455
Oh, yes, one of the deadliest

58
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,915
plants on earth. Why,

59
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,083
it tries to warn you itself

60
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,585
with its terrible taste.

61
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,462
Sure is easy when
they're stiff like this...

62
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,257
and very sad.

63
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,099
HOMER: St. Peter.

64
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,434
Whoo-hoo!

65
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,187
Got to heaven before you, Flanders!

66
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,522
(mocking grunts)

67
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,192
I wouldn't celebrate so soon, Mr. Simpson.

68
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,445
I don't see a single good deed
next to your name.

69
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,989
Well, the thing about that is...

70
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,409
(screams)

71
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,620
Homer, settle down.

72
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,830
I'll give you a chance to get into heaven.

73
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,166
You have 24 hours to go back

74
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,126
and do one good deed.

75
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,587
I'm sorry, I didn't get the
number of hours or good deeds.

76
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,507
(yells)

77
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,594
Oh, Homie, I still can't believe

78
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,596
a piece of broccoli killed you.

79
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,557
What the hell was I thinking?

80
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,185
(gasps)

81
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,566
I tried the broccoli again.

82
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,611
Uh. You have 23 hours left.

83
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,820
(yells)

84
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,824
(wind howling)

85
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,577
(ghost-like voice) Marge Simpson...

86
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,663
Homer, it's you!

87
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,539
I thought I'd never see you again.

88
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,208
You were wrong.

89
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,960
Dead wrong!

90
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,753
Do you have to talk like that?

91
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,046
(normal voice) No, not really.

92
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,089
Marge, you got to help me.

93
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,090
I have to do one good deed

94
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,216
to get into heaven.

95
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,468
Well, I've got a whole list of chores.

96
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,678
"Clean the garage,

97
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,762
paint the house, grout the--"

98
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,763
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

99
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:24,847
I'm just trying to get in.

100
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,266
I'm not running for Jesus.

101
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,393
OK, good deed. Good deed.

102
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,644
Hello.

103
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,231
(horn honking)

104
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,358
BOY SCOUTS: Hey, a chance for a good deed.

105
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,028
No, she's mine!

106
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,072
Oh, my Lord--

107
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,616
Wh-what's happening to me?

108
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,785
People can see up my bustle.

109
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,245
Hey, stop squirming.

110
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,371
(yells)

111
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,455
(loud splat)

112
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,456
Uh-oh.

113
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,833
Uh... I'm pretty sure

114
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,835
she was going to be the next Hitler.

115
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,254
Hello? Good deed done.

116
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,923
(bell rings)

117
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,092
Let's see... Good deed.

118
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,677
(yells)

119
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,387
(screams)

120
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,930
Got to find a good deed.

121
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,515
(groaning and laughing)

122
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,599
Bingo!

123
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,059
<i>♪ Your daddy's dead ♪</i>

124
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,769
<i>♪ Mine's just in jail ♪</i>

125
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,565
Nelson...

126
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,358
Huh? Who said that?

127
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,735
I am the ghost of...

128
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,736
Gotcha.

129
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,903
(laughing)

130
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,405
Bart, help!

131
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,741
(yelling and moaning)

132
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,829
Just one minute left to get into heaven.

133
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,873
There's got to be some good deed I can do.

134
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,083
Come on. Think. Think!

135
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,339
-My baby!
-(baby crying)

136
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,548
Stop that crying.

137
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,177
Man, you're annoying.

138
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,601
Oh, it's a miracle!

139
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,602
Thank heavens.

140
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,686
HOMER: Whoo-hoo!

141
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,606
Did you see that?

142
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,274
I did the deed! Open up!

143
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,400
Oh, I'm so sorry.

144
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,610
I wasn't looking.

145
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,363
Hey, I thought you guys
could see everything.

146
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,114
No, you're thinking of Santa Claus.

147
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,699
Well, I'll be damned.

148
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,159
I'm afraid so, yes.

149
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,494
(screaming)

150
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,538
(screaming)

151
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,333
(whimpering)

152
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,003
I am Homer Simpson.

153
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,338
Silence, sinner!

154
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,131
Prepare for an eternity

155
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,217
of horrible pain!

156
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,843
(whimpering)

157
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,678
Ha-ha.

158
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,306
(screaming and crying)

159
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,474
Oh, be quiet.

160
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,850
You'll wake up John Wayne.

161
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,103
I'm already up.

162
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,070
(buzzing)

163
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,823
Son, I don't like you watching that fire.

164
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,032
It's too violent.

165
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,867
(explosion)

166
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,702
(laughing)

167
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,454
You're missing the best part, sister.

168
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,705
Forget that stupid book.

169
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,249
But these fairy tales take me away

170
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,084
from the harsh reality of peasant life.

171
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,377
Aw, it's not so bad.

172
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,295
Ow!

173
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,507
Oh, I just got over the plague.

174
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,509
Hello, wife.

175
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,760
Hello, children.

176
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,430
Who's up for a merry jig?

177
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,057
Do-de-do, do-de-do...

178
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,267
Ow!

179
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,893
Oh, who am I kidding?

180
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,019
I'm not merry.

181
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,898
I lost my job as an oaf today.

182
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:21,941
What?

183
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,526
Oh, why are the oafs

184
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,570
always the first to go?

185
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,029
Maybe you could be a dunce, father.

186
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,739
-Really?
-Hey!

187
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:32,910
What do you think?

188
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,078
Do you love it?

189
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,330
(screams) Oh, oh!

190
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,791
Oh, I'm no dunce.

191
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,085
I was born an oaf and I'll die an oaf.

192
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,421
But, husband, without
your weekly pittance,

193
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,881
how shall we feed our children?

194
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,257
Don't worry.

195
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,926
No child will ever starve in my home.

196
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,386
So long kids.

197
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,930
-(kids scream)
-Enjoy your new home!

198
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,309
Say hi to your other brother and sister.

199
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,560
(both grunt)

200
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,687
Other brother and sister?

201
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,230
(both scream)

202
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,399
Face it, they're not great parents.

203
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,237
No! That bridge has a troll under it.

204
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,322
-Yah!
-Yah!

205
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,574
Everything in this forest is
from a fairy tale.

206
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,368
And this book can keep us one step ahead.

207
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,498
Ah Jeez, I came on too strong again.

208
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,500
Oh, I'm so desperately lonely.

209
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,543
(owl hooting)

210
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,422
Hello!

211
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,090
Lost lovable orphans!

212
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,176
-(creaking)
-(gasps)

213
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,058
Hmm, bowls of porridge.

214
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,435
Oh, this seems somehow familiar.

215
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,520
Let's see.

216
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,938
Hmm...

217
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,231
Oh, whoa, too hot.

218
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:45,983
Oh, too cold.

219
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,860
Well, this doesn't take a genius.

220
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,405
(gasp)

221
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,407
We're in the Three Bears' house!

222
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,700
(creaking)

223
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,327
(gasps)

224
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,412
(humming)

225
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,416
(slam)

226
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,211
(panting)

227
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,462
That was close.

228
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,422
I wonder where Goldilocks was?

229
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,091
(yawning)

230
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:13,886
Oh, that bed was just right.

231
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,971
Gah!

232
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,514
Oh, no!

233
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,807
(bears roaring)

234
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,100
(pounding)

235
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,185
(Goldilocks screaming)

236
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,770
(moaning)

237
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,818
Boy, dumping your kids in the forest

238
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,611
sure gets your hands dusty.

239
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,612
What?

240
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,947
You threw our precious babies

241
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,198
into the woods?

242
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,533
We could have sold them.

243
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,994
Go back and get them.

244
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,453
Here's a better idea.

245
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,789
I know how we can replace those children.

246
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:42,873
(purrs)

247
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,375
Son!

248
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,418
Daughter!

249
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,295
I'm ever so sorry!

250
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:51,841
(woman la-la-ing to tune of
<i>"Greensleeves")</i>

251
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,386
Brave sir knight, I pray you!

252
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,096
Climb up and rescue me!

253
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,017
Hmm. Hmm.

254
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,893
Ow! No, wait!

255
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:03,978
Wait!

256
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,980
-(ripping)
-D'oh!

257
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,648
(groans)

258
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,652
(whistling)

259
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,697
Wow, a house made of gingerbread.

260
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,783
Come on in, my darlings.

261
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,869
The best candies are inside.

262
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,787
Wait. Let me check the book.

263
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,748
(cackling)

264
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,458
Aw, she seems nice.

265
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,834
I'm going to go with my gut and trust her.

266
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,044
You're probably right.

267
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,256
(cackling)

268
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,217
Sweep faster. It's almost time
for your beating.

269
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,387
Oh, this is horrible.

270
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,680
Horribly delicious.

271
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,806
(chomping)

272
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,600
You know, she's only fattening you up

273
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,809
so she can eat you.

274
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,019
Ah, what are you going to do?

275
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,649
Well, at least stop basting yourself.

276
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,567
Stop your chattering and sweep!

277
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,527
-This house is filthy.
-So what do you care?

278
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,695
It's not like you have friends.

279
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,238
I have a boyfriend.

280
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,657
-Yeah, right.
-Sure.

281
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,949
What? I do!

282
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,660
Oh, yeah? What's his name?

283
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,370
Uh, George...

284
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,205
Cauldron.

285
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,040
George Cauldron?

286
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,668
Maybe he can fix me up with Ed Ladle.

287
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,461
(laughing)

288
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,629
That's it!

289
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,588
Into the oven with you!

290
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,006
No! (screaming)

291
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,258
Oh, no!

292
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,802
-Ah!
-What?

293
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,639
Mmm, sugar walls.

294
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,974
Father, I knew you'd rescue us!

295
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,769
Hmm. Rescue you, stuff myself with candy,
it's all good.

296
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,273
Oh, that's a load-bearing candy cane!

297
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,608
You clumsy oaf!

298
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,652
D'oh!

299
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,363
(whimpering)

300
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,740
(gasps)

301
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,242
Hyah!

302
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,411
(shouts) Ooh!

303
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,413
(shouts)

304
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,081
(gasps)

305
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,999
That all you got?

306
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,209
Huh, huh?

307
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,586
(grunting and groaning)

308
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,046
(sniffing)

309
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,172
Hmm, fish.

310
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,049
Oh, no, that's me! Agh!

311
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,050
Come on. Get me out of here!

312
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,051
(speaking indistinctly)

313
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,219
(doorbell ringing)

314
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,762
Just a minute!

315
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,389
(grunting)

316
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,100
(screaming)

317
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,102
WITCH: Oh, god, no!

318
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,729
Let me out!

319
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,856
I couldn't be in more pain!

320
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,232
(screaming)

321
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,609
(crackling)

322
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,112
(sighs)

323
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,406
Er, hello, I'm George Cauldron.

324
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,949
Is Suzanne ready yet?

325
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,909
Almost, just give her another 20 minutes.

326
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,704
(laughing)

327
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,080
But the concert's at 8:00.

328
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,125
(chomping)

329
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,543
Well, we're still poor

330
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,919
but thanks to your father,

331
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,546
we'll never go hungry.

332
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,548
Speaking of which, how about seconds?

333
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,591
Coming up.

334
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,050
(humming)

335
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:44,805
(panting, straining)

336
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,098
D'oh!

337
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,863
(crowd speaking indistinctly)

338
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,240
Let's give Snorky a big hand.

339
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,701
-(applause)
-Whoo! Yay, Snorky!

340
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,537
Now, we're going to need a
volunteer to frolic with Snorky

341
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,955
so raise your hand if you want to be--

342
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,500
(clamoring)

343
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,837
(shrieks, whines)

344
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,881
Oh, Snorky.

345
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,133
MAN: <i>Folks, we're heating up</i>
<i>the lobster tank</i>

346
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,218
<i>so hurry on over</i>

347
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,511
<i>if you want to pet 'em</i>

348
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,637
<i>before you eat 'em.</i>

349
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,514
(indistinct chatter)

350
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,516
It's OK. They're gone now.

351
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,517
You can...

352
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,810
Hey, where you going?

353
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,688
(chittering, dolphins calling)

354
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,484
(chittering)

355
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,986
Oh. You want to be with your friends.

356
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,615
Um...

357
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,033
(squeaks)

358
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,201
Oh...

359
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,541
(alarm buzzing)

360
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,625
It's getting away.

361
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,751
Kill it!

362
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,503
Go on.

363
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,963
Swim to freedom. Go!

364
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,049
(guns cocking)

365
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,096
Ahh!

366
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,597
(chittering)

367
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,559
Ahh!

368
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,896
Ew, yech!

369
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,986
(chittering)

370
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,405
(squeaking)

371
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,367
(chittering)

372
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:32,204
(squeaking)

373
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,459
(continues squeaking)

374
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,930
Mmm. Alcohol and night swimming.

375
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,432
It's a winning combination.

376
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,105
Uh-oh. Sharks.

377
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,690
The assassins of the sea.

378
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,318
-(chittering)
-Ooh. Hey, you're not sharks.

379
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,569
You're dolphins.

380
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,237
The clowns of the sea.

381
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,615
Ow! Ow!

382
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,033
Hey, what's the gag?

383
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,121
(shrieking) Ow!

384
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,503
Hmm. Bottlenose bruises.

385
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,630
Blowhole burns.

386
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,048
Flipper prints.

387
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,300
This looks like the work of rowdy teens.

388
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,551
Lou, cancel the prom.

389
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,973
Yarrgh. It begins.

390
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,850
The dolphins are upon us

391
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,894
and only this old sea dog

392
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,271
knows how to stop the... Yarrgh!

393
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,152
Ar. Arr!

394
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,738
(laughing)

395
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,410
(squeaking)

396
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,047
(chittering)

397
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,094
(squeaking)

398
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,351
(chanting)

399
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,728
(repeating chanting)

400
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,442
(whining)

401
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,695
(whimpers)

402
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,575
HOMER: Two krusty shakes,
a doughnut burger with cheese

403
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,120
and a party-size bucket of flan.

404
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,539
(dolphin chittering)

405
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,082
Yes, I will have fries with that.

406
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,667
-(engine revving)
-(tires screeching)

407
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,464
Huh. Anything to get out of work.

408
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,468
Our top story-- killer dolphins.

409
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,678
Kill dolphins?

410
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,513
The recent wave of murders...

411
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,681
(man shrieks)

412
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,391
(groans)

413
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,520
Um... Di... Did I say "killer dolphins"?

414
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,897
I meant killer... Italians.

415
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,276
Great, bottlenose, intelligent Italians.

416
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,902
Intelligent Italians?

417
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,154
Something's wrong.

418
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,280
It's dolphins.

419
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,614
We have to stop them.

420
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,324
If we speak in low-frequency voices

421
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,826
I don't think they can...

422
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:16,910
Ow!

423
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:19,997
(all gasping)

424
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,041
Those dolphins seem bent on mayhem.

425
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,834
We've got to warn grampa.

426
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:27,880
(busy signal)

427
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,423
Hmm. Phone's off the hook.

428
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,758
Everything must be OK.

429
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,051
(straining)

430
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,806
Oh, I'm going to give
your liver such a punching!

431
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,141
(murmuring)

432
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,684
(banging gavel)

433
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,810
People, please.

434
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,937
We're all frightened and horny,

435
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,356
but we can't let some killer dolphins

436
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,609
keep us from living and scoring.

437
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,152
(squeaking)

438
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,779
(all gasping)

439
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,072
(squeaking)

440
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,948
Willie, must you do that now?

441
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,617
Ugh. You want streaks?

442
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,827
'Cause if you interrupt me,
that's what you'll get.

443
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,912
Och.

444
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,291
-(guns cocking)
-(gasping)

445
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,584
(all gasping)

446
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,880
(chittering)

447
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,636
It's approaching the podium.

448
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,221
Surely it cannot speak.

449
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,474
Snorky... talk...

450
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,518
man...

451
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,811
(clearing throat)

452
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:25,854
I'm sorry, let me start over.

453
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,316
Eons ago, dolphins lived on the land.

454
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,026
-(gasping)
-What did he say?

455
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,069
He said dolphins used

456
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,237
to live on the land.

457
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,446
What?

458
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,281
Then your ancestors

459
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,616
drove us into the sea

460
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,160
where we've suffered
for millions of years.

461
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,371
But you seemed so happy in the ocean.

462
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,498
All that playful leaping.

463
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,666
We were trying to get out.

464
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,000
It's cold, it's wet.

465
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,877
Every morning I wake up phlegmy.

466
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,587
That's all that sewage we keep dumping.

467
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,713
(gasps) That was you?

468
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,923
It was her all right.

469
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,800
Take the one who wronged you.

470
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:59,471
I, King Snorky, hereby banish
all humans to the sea.

471
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,556
(gasping)

472
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,724
Yeah!

473
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,226
(indistinct chatter)

474
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,352
KRUSTY: Pushy dolphins.

475
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,436
(indistinct chatter)

476
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,564
I-I tuned out. W-where we going?

477
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,690
Wait. Stop.

478
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,191
We can outsmart those dolphins.

479
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,527
Don't forget, we invented computers,

480
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,029
leg-warmers, bendy straws,
peel-and-eat shrimp,

481
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,615
the glory hole, <i>and </i>the pudding cup.

482
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:22,411
I'm not going to let a few
hoop-jumping tuna-munchers

483
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,745
push me around!

484
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,788
(grunts)

485
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,789
Uh-oh.

486
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:26,915
(all gasping)

487
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,502
(squeaks)

488
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,888
Jeez, so many dolphins.

489
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,144
(squeaking)

490
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,653
-(whimpers)
-Oh, no, you poor thing...

491
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,697
Here... Ow!

492
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,782
-Son of a--
-Hey, leave my daughter alone.

493
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,492
Come on, humans.

494
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,912
We've wiped out entire species before,

495
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:05,996
we can do it again!

496
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,456
Yeah!

497
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,374
Get 'em!

498
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,043
(punches landing)

499
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,004
(grunting and groaning)

500
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,799
Ah! Oh! Ah! Oh! Help!

501
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,385
Ooh! If I could just...

502
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,845
Ooh! This is really not... Ooh!

503
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,971
You're hurting my... Ooh!

504
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:23,972
Ow!

505
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,933
Ow! Ooh! Ow!

506
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,771
(slingshot thwacks)

507
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,608
Come on, lads!

508
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,361
Let's drive 'em back to the ocean!

509
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,738
(crowd screaming)

510
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,160
(bell chiming)

511
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,705
Well, you got to hand it
to those dolphins.

512
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,082
They just wanted it more.

513
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,251
I kind of wish I hadn't
freed their leader.

514
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,754
And, you know... doomed mankind.

515
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,423
Oh, honey, I wouldn't say "doomed."

516
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,884
It's going to be
an adjustment, no question.

517
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,386
But... Ugh...

518
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,145
Can you believe it, Kodos?

519
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,773
They left us out of the Halloween show.

520
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,818
Are you sure the space phone is working?

521
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,695
-(dial tone)
-Hang up.

522
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,863
They could be trying to call right now.

523
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,574
I <i>knew </i>we should have sent
them a muffin basket.

524
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,659
(phone ringing)

525
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,495
Kang and Kodos productions.

526
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,331
Uh-huh. Yes.

527
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,417
Just a second.

528
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,960
Do we want to do a commercial

529
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,920
for something called "Old Navy"?

530
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,214
Mmm, work is work.

531
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,556
(theme music playing)

532
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,720
