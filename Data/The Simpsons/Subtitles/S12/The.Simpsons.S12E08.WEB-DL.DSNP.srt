where they finally kiss.

173
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:27,441
I don't care if they're kissing
Kristi Yamaguchi. You're not going home!

174
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,778
-That's so unfair!
-This blows.

175
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,989
Skinner's the real Grinch!

176
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,660
-(engine starts)
-I'm all for rescuing the kids

177
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,996
but I wish you hadn't sawed off my roof.

178
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,916
My car, your roof. It's only fair.

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,711
-B-- But it's my car.
-Well, yeah.

180
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,047
Hey, whatever happened to the plow
from your old snowplow business?

181
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:54,135
-I never had a snowplow business.
-Sure, you did. "Mr. Plow."

182
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,220
You're wearing the jacket right now.

183
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,889
I think I know my own life, Ned.

184
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,183
<i>♪ Call Mr. Plow</i>
<i>That's my name ♪</i>

185
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,311
<i>♪ That name again is Mr. Plow ♪</i>

186
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,481
I'm so hungry. I want more.

187
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,858
You heard the principal.

188
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,736
Everyone gets one apple
and a handful of relish!

189
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,489
(gags, coughing)

190
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:19,076
If you don't eat your relish,
you're not getting any mayonnaise.

191
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,873
Screw this. The rest of you can stay here
like dorks, but I'm going home.

192
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,958
-(all cheering)
-Go, Nelson!

193
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:31,172
-(groans)
-(all gasping)

194
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,346
Well, I hope you've all learned something
from Nelson's "headstrongedness."

195
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,765
-And from now on--
-(chanting) We want out!

196
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,851
-We want out! We want out!
-Uh...

197
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:47,980
-CHILDREN (chanting): We want out!
-Yeesh! It's getting ugly out there.

198
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,941
Mmm. Think, Skinner, think.

199
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,111
What would Superintendent Chalmers do?

200
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,614
-Skinner!
-Eh, that's no help.

201
00:10:56,697 --> 00:11:00,868
Mmm. Ah! My old footlocker.

202
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,788
(chuckles) Back in 'Nam,
I could command respect.

203
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,123
(helicopter blades whirring)

204
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,335
Sarge, let's make a break for it while
the guards are partying with Jane Fonda.

205
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:13,464
Nope. Too dangerous. We're all gonna
sit tight and reminisce about candy bars.

206
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:17,385
Uh, well, uh, one time,
I'm eating a candy bar at the beach

207
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,428
and a girl starts taking off
her bathing suit--

208
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,846
Get back to the candy bar!

209
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,641
The hell with this.
I'm gettin' outta here!

210
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,142
-No, you fool!
-(elephant trumpeting)

211
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,852
(screaming)

212
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,105
(shouting)

213
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,693
That elephant ate my entire platoon.

214
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,195
Well, I'm not gonna let it happen again!

215
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,448
(all chattering, laughing)

216
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,492
-(door closes)
-Children, stand down!

217
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,078
-Huh?
-I said, stand down!

218
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,372
(confused chattering)

219
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,748
I'm not joking, people.

220
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,001
From now on, there will be no
talking out of turn or leaving this room.

221
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,837
-Willie?
-Aye, sir!

222
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,091
-NELSON: This sucks!
-Are you questioning my authority?

223
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,175
Willie!

224
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,679
(groans) Ow! My vest.

225
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,889
Don't just stand there. Fight back.

226
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,016
There aren't enough coat hooks
to hold all of us!

227
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,854
Actually there are. Five, 10, 15, 20--
Uh, can you two share a hook?

228
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,731
-BOTH: Yes, sir.
-We're fine then.

229
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,648
(groans)

230
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,068
-(thud)
-Oh.

231
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:21,115
-I think we hit something.
-I hope it's Flanders. (chuckling)

232
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:24,201
I'm just kidding! Hey, you're all right.

233
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,621
-(yawning)
-(snoring)

234
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:32,084
Ah, now, children, if you have to answer
nature's call during the night,

235
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,754
-use this bucket next to Bart's head.
-Hey!

236
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,380
All right. Lights out.

237
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:37,715
(door closes)

238
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,842
I'm tired of taking orders from G.I. Jerk!

239
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,927
-I'm gonna tunnel out of here!
-No, Bart.

240
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,929
For all we know,
hundreds of rescue workers

241
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,765
are digging us out right now.

242
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:49,059
(sniffing, growling)

243
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,986
<i>♪ I feel like making love ♪</i>

244
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,781
<i>♪ Making love to you ♪</i>

245
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,450
-(humming)
-(crashing)

246
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,786
Catchy song, all right.
You really wrote it?

247
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,663
Yeah. As a tribute to Princess Di.

248
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,708
And Dodi. Because these days, princesses--

249
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:19,340
(groaning) We're trapped!

250
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,383
(grunting)

251
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,724
Mr. Army Man? I can't sleep
without my Reggie Rabbit.

252
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,727
-Is that some sort of plush novelty?
-Yes, ma'am.

253
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,104
(groans) Well, here's a scouring pad.
It's just as good.

254
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,941
It's cold and hurt-y.

255
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,276
(yawns)

256
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,528
Uh-- What the--

257
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,408
(gasps) A tunnel! (blows whistle)

258
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,619
-(murmuring)
-Bart's digging us out!

259
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:52,706
-Not on my watch he's not!
-Oh, no!

260
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,834
I know it looks like the path to freedom.

261
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,795
But one collapse, and presto--
you've got a snow casket.

262
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,630
I was gonna put buttresses in.

263
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,967
Gonna, wanna, shoulda. Willie, destroy it.

264
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,053
(all protesting)

265
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,347
He did do a bonny job, sir.

266
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:13,435
Defying orders, eh? Well, I see you
Scotsmen are thrifty with courage, too.

267
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,104
OK, Skinner.

268
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,858
That's the last time
you'll slap your Willie around.

269
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,278
-I quit!
-Fine. I'll do the job myself.

270
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,738
(grunting)

271
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,200
Help! It's caving in!

272
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:32,246
-Oh!
-What's the problem, Seymour? Stuck?

273
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,498
That's precisely the problem,
and you know it.

274
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,126
-Now, get me out of here!
-What's that?

275
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,838
-You want the pee bucket on your head?
-No! You're twisting my words!

276
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,384
BART: Come on!
We're taking over the school!

277
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,136
(all cheering)

278
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,142
That's it! Cinch it up around the neck.

279
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,979
(chokes)
This is a gross misuse of school property.

280
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,940
-Where are the dodge balls? Ow!
-(children cheering)

281
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,817
Ow! Ohh!

282
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,028
All right. That's it.

283
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,781
I'm writing all your names
on the detention list in my mind.

284
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,242
Silence, Seymour! We're in charge now.

285
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,328
Your reign of fussiness is over.

286
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,080
BART (on P.A.): <i>Attention.</i>
<i>The school is now under kid control.</i>

287
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,166
<i>You are hereby ordered to go nuts!</i>

288
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,266
Huh?

289
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,480
-(engine revving)
-Aw, stupid ice!

290
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,941
I always knew I would die
caked in something.

291
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,736
Well, better turn off that engine
before those fumes put us in tombs.

292
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,072
Wait. Let's just leave it on...

293
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,990
till we forget our troubles.

294
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,284
Mm, sounds like a plan.

295
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,578
(guttural groaning)

296
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,123
I can't write this.
It's a grammatical nightmare.

297
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,377
<i>-Mau! Didi mau!</i>
-I'm getting a cramp in my wrist!

298
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,213
Oh, boo-hoo.
After all the times I've done it,

299
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,341
-my wrist sounds like a cement mixer.
-(bones cracking)

300
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,010
(grunting)

301
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,806
-Ow!
-Come on, Seymour.

302
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,891
-<i>Mau! Didi mau!</i>
-Ow!

303
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,353
I told you no one can climb a rope.
It's physically impossible.

304
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,398
What part of <i>didi mau</i>
don't you understand?

305
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,694
Nelson, put that globe down!
Milhouse, stay out of my desk!

306
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,779
Jimbo, that's my Princey Award!

307
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,198
Quiet, Principal Spinner!

308
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,075
Whoa!

309
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,952
Hey, I got Skinner's key card!

310
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,413
We can finally see our permanent records!

311
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,581
SKINNER: No! You can't go in there!

312
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,002
(cheering)

313
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:47,381
"Underachiever and proud of it."
How old is this thing?

314
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:52,511
"Lisa is an outstanding student with
a slight tendency toward know-it-all-ism"?

315
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,389
(gasps) That's not even a word!

316
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,808
Then we'll get rid
of the record permanently!

317
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,352
(grunting)

318
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:03,897
(both gasp)

319
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,316
Hey, look how much Skinner makes.

320
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,112
-Twenty-five thousand dollars a year!
-ALL: Wow!

321
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,199
Let's see. He's 40 years old,
times 25 grand.

322
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,870
-Whoa! He's a millionaire!
-Wow!

323
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,997
I wasn't a principal when I was one!

324
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,916
Plus, in the summer, he paints houses!

325
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,961
-He's a billionaire!
-Wow!

326
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,797
If I were a billionaire,
why would I be living with my mother?

327
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,674
(children laughing)

328
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,093
Oh, they're just not responding
to logic anymore.

329
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,345
(sighs) I'll never win this alone.

330
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,056
There's only one guy who can help me now.

331
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,934
(chittering)

332
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,063
-Look! I'm throwing paper!
-(grunting)

333
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,815
(mumbling)

334
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,236
(chittering)

335
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,238
SKINNER: You're my only hope, Nibbles.

336
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,495
(grunting)

337
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,083
Godspeed, Nibbles. Godspeed.

338
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,128
-Aw, nuts.
-(switch clicks)

339
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:12,382
There you are! Falcon to Eagle.
Have located bag-of-crap.

340
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,634
Nelson, if you get me out of this,

341
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,345
there's a hall monitor position
coming open in the spring.

342
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,180
I spit on your monitors!

343
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,057
I know.
That's why the position's available.

344
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,017
(both snoring)

345
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,562
-(Middle-Eastern music playing)
-Huh?

346
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,191
Marvelous! Marvelous!

347
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:33,403
Enough! I grow weary
of your sexually suggestive dancing.

348
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,864
Bring me my ranch dressing hose!

349
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,582
(grunting) Homer? Homer!

350
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,337
-Homer, wake up! The car's filling with--
-I know. Ranch dressing.

351
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,632
-(chittering)
-A hamster ball!

352
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,884
(gasps)
Just like the one that saved Ezekiel!

353
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,137
(both breathing deeply)

354
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,640
We're free!
And we've got something to eat!

355
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,599
-(chittering)
-(gasps)

356
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:11,066
-Whoo-hoo!
-Now, let's go save those kids!

357
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,778
You're the camel!
Hey, this car's got cruise control.

358
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,405
School, please.

359
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,699
<i>♪ Dee-dee-dee</i>
<i>da-da-dum ♪</i>

360
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,368
Homer, that's not how it-- (screaming)

361
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,000
It's happening. My horoscope was right!

362
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:35,174
So long, Johnny Tremain.
Your Newberry Award won't save you now!

363
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,468
Not Huck Finn! I spent hours
crossing out the sass-back!

364
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,763
-(gasps) We're gonna crash!
-Do you have air bags?

365
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,308
No! The church opposes them
for some reason!

366
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:45,809
(Homer screaming)

367
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,314
(both screaming)

368
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:59,448
-What was that?
-It sounded like a silo tipping over.

369
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,245
Look! The snow's melting!

370
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:10,375
With a little help from our friend,
sodium chloride!

371
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,878
(groaning)

372
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:18,008
-(all cheering)
-(Homer gasping)

373
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,346
-Dad!
-(groaning)

374
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:31,313
(gasps) You did it, Nibbles!
Now, chew through my ball sack.

375
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,607
-Huh?
-(snowmobile approaching)

376
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,526
-Skinner!
-Oh! Superintendent Chalmers!

377
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,529
What are you doing in that
ridiculous duffel, Seymour?

378
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,157
And is that burning literature I smell?

379
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,910
Uh-- (stammes) Well, sir, I, uh--

380
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:48,538
There'd better be a good
explanation for this.

381
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,500
-There is, sir.
-Ah! Then I'm happy.

382
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,377
(horn honking)

383
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,046
Bart, if there's one thing I'm good at...

384
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,382
it's pretending things didn't happen.

385
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,175
And I think this is one of those.

386
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,552
-One of which?
-Exactly.

387
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,680
No, seriously. I wasn't listening.

388
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,058
-One of those situations where--
-Gotcha!

389
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,935
(laughs)

390
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:14,314
Come on, kids. Let's leave this
awful place and never come back.

391
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,234
(bang)

392
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,193
(coughs)

393
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,070
Boy, that salt really ate through the car.

394
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:23,073
-And the exhaust pipe is leaking.
-Wha--

395
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:28,078
And furthermore-- (braying)

396
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,539
Ignore her, Effendi. We have each other.

397
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,041
-Oh, baby.
-Aah!

398
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,628
HOMER: No use struggling,
my beloved Shelamela.

399
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,880
Merry Christmas from the Simpsons!

400
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,716
(braying)

401
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,302
(braying continues)

402
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:49,850
(theme music playing)

403
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,263
-(murmuring)
-Shh!
