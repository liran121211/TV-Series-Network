00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:11,905
Woof.

15
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,544
Hey, open up!

16
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,797
I've been standing here
all morning.

17
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,174
Hey, Homer.
What are you doing at work?

18
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,301
The plant's closed
for fumigation.

19
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,804
(humming)

20
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,764
Uh-oh!

21
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,934
(panicked gasping)

22
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,727
Ohh...

23
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,979
No one told me
the plant was closed.

24
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,106
Didn't you get the e-mail?

25
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,065
What's an e-mail?

26
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,525
It's a computer thing

27
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,859
like an electric letter.

28
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,444
Or a quiet phone call.

29
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,029
I don't have a computer.

30
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,030
(laughs)

31
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,282
Too bad.
That's why you're at work

32
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,535
while we're living it up
on our day off.

33
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,578
Hey, Karl,
turn up the car radio.

34
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,206
Why not?
Anything goes today.

35
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:07,502
(swing music playing on radio)

36
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,296
That does it.
I'm getting a computer...

37
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,298
as soon as somebody
lets me out of here.

38
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,175
(rattling)

39
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,846
Oh. (chuckles) I'm so stupid.

40
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,643
Um, I guess I'll take that one.

41
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,311
Do you need a paperweight?

42
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,522
Because if you buy that machine
that's all you're going to have

43
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,815
is an expensive paperweight.

44
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,650
Well, a paperweight
would be nice

45
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,110
but what I really need
is a computer.

46
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,611
How about that one?

47
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,322
Mm-hmm. That technology
is three months old.

48
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,324
Only suckers buy
out-of-date machines.

49
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,368
Uh, you're not a sucker,
are you, sir?

50
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,578
Heavens, no.

51
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,581
Oh, good. Because if you were,
I'd ask you to leave the store.

52
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,708
I just need something
to receive e-mail.

53
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,625
(whistles)

54
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,919
You'll need a top-of-the-line
machine for that.

55
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:51,796
That's the same computer

56
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,923
astronauts use
to do their taxes.

57
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,091
I was an astronaut.

58
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,426
Of course you were.

59
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,428
Hmm.

60
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,808
$5,000?

61
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,477
You only have ten seconds
to decide, sir.

62
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,812
(whimpering)

63
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,355
This is the best computer
in the world

64
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,523
and always will be, right?

65
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,524
Absolutely.

66
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,526
Just run the deed to your house
through here.

67
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,114

71
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,162
Hey, Lisa.

72
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,373
Check out my new computer.

73
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,584
Dad, you shouldn't drag
that around.

74
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,710
(laughs)

75
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,503
That's right, top of the line.

76
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,382
(screams, groans)

77
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,009
Stupid pothole.

78
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,177
Don't worry, head.

79
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,804
The computer
will do our thinking now.

80
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,478
Oh, yeah, perfect.

81
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,232
Now, then, computer,
kill Flanders.

82
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,816
Did I hear my name?

83
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,901
My ears are burning.

84
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,110
Good start.

85
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,445
Now finish the job.

86
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,738
Oh, you're busy.

87
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,531
Catch you later, compu-tater.

88
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,575
Oh, $5,000 for a computer

89
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,786
and it can't handle
a simple assignment.

90
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,913
(grunting)

91
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,081
(whines)

92
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,958
Dad, I'll set up your computer.

93
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,210
Why don't you and Bart
go play in the backyard?

94
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,127
You're it.

95
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,545

00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,139
I've written down
the basic commands

101
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,933

can understand them.

102
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,184

104
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,104
bring that back in the house.

but they're not.

127
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,113
I got suspended
from school today.

128
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,239
No kidding?

129
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,283
What do you think
of my page, Lisa?

130
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,284
Be honest.

131
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,285
It's great, isn't it?
Go ahead

132
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,911
and say it's great
if you want to.

133
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,788
They found a switchblade
in my locker.

134
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,916
Well, a web page is supposed
to be a personal thing.

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,170
You've just stolen copyrighted
material from everyone else.

136
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,963
They can sue you for that.

137
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,298
I took a swing at a cop.

138
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,425
They can't sue me
if they don't know who I am.

139
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,511
I'll just call myself Mr. X.

141

I'm just mad all the time.

00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,934
Yup, you can't
go wrong with Mr. X.

143
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,147
Mom wants you to come to bed.

144
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,650
I can't. My web page

146
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,612
Come on.

147
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,781
You have to offer
people something...

148
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,075
a joke, an opinion, an idea.

149
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,331
That lousy pothole.

150
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,582
Why don't they fix it?

151
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,418
I heard Mayor Quimby
spent the street repair fund

152
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,045
on a secret swimming pool
for himself.

153
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,005
-Get out. Who told you that?
-Nelson.

154
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,342
Ooh, that's the kind of dirt
that belongs on my web page.

155
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,387
You can't post that
on the Internet.

156
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,930
You don't even know
if it's true.

157
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,641
Nelson has never steered me
wrong, honey.

158
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,351
Nelson is gold.

159
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,603
You know,
it might have been Jimbo.

160
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,730

00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,115
X-rated girls...
already bookmarked...

165
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,366
Dial "X" for sex.

166
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,451
Mr. X?

167
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:54,539
Hmm, shall I cross
the final frontier?

No, Mother.

180
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,946
What's all this about
a secret swimming pool?

181
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,116
Uh, well, what secret
swimming pool is that?

182
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,369
Hey, let's look
behind that door.

183
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,246
QUIMBY: Don't go in there.

184
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,248
(all gasp)

185
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,877
(indistinct chatter)

186
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,799
Good lord, we've discovered
the ruins of an ancient city.

187
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,801
OK, you do better.

188
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,474
I did it.

189
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,350
I changed the world.

190
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,270
Now I know exactly
how God feels.

191
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,689
You want turkey sausage or ham?

192
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,317
Bring me two of every animal.

193
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,485
(mews)

194
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,031
<i>A new Internet watchdog</i>

195
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,741
<i>is creating a stir</i>
<i>in Springfield.</i>

196
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,368
<i>Mr. X, if that is his real name,</i>

197
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,329
<i>has come up</i>
<i>with a sensational scoop.</i>

198
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,330
Darn tootin'.

199
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,540
<i>But we must never forget</i>
<i>that the real news</i>

200
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,583
<i>is on local TV</i>

201
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,336
<i>delivered by real,</i>
<i>officially licensed newsmen</i>

202
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,795
<i>like me, Kent Brockman.</i>

203
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,923
<i>Coming up,</i>
<i>how do they get those dogs</i>

204
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,257
<i>to talk on the beer commercials?</i>

205
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,717
<i>Cowboy Steve will tell you.</i>

206
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,346
I'm happy you got
the potholes filled

207
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,807
but it's still irresponsible
to present rumors as facts.

208
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,809
Maybe you should quit
while you're ahead.

209
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,729
No way. Mr. X is going
to keep on digging and probing

210
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,315
until every person
in this town is in jail.

211
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,237
Argh! A coconut bagel!

212
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,030
Like poison, it tastes.

213
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,657
All right,
I'll tell you a secret.

214
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,410
My bagels are nothing
but week-old doughnuts.

215
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,955
Aw, who am I
to point the finger?

216
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,791
I once ran over a guy
in a parking lot

217
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,752
and dumped the body
on a golf course.

218
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,923
What a bombshell.

219
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,594
CHIEF WIGGUM:
In the interest of public safety

220
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,181
we have confiscated every
doughnut, bagel, cruller

221
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,016
and bear claw in the city.

222
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,184
And some coffee.

223
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,143
(slurping)

224
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,063
This morning, Mr. X reported
that your own department--

225
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,692
I know, I know, but I assure you
the police do not take prisoners

226
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,070
out of their cells
and race them... anymore.

227
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,947
What about using the electric
chair to cook chicken?

228
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,448
Yeah, uh,
this press conference is over.

229
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,034
-Wait. I have one more.
-No, it's over, Phil. It's over.

230
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,161
KENNY: According to my uncle

231
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,582
Miss Springfield
isn't as beautiful as she seems.

232
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,501
Word is, she uses
appearance-altering cosmetics?

233
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,628
-Oh, my God.
-That's shocking.

234
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,255
The public should be warned.

235
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,923
I wish Mr. X were here.

236
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,967
Oh, I don't know, Carl.

237
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,219
He might be closer
than you think.

238
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,178
Are you him?

239
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,221
-Are you Mr. X?
-No.

240
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,348
But you talk
in that real sly voice.

241
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,517
Hey, hey, everybody!
Homer's Mr. X.

242
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,435
I am not.

243
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,228
Or am I?

244
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,229
Are you?

245
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,230
No!

246
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,608
Well, if Mr. X were here
right now

247
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,568
I'd buy him a tall frosty.

248
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,069
Hey, Moe, can you keep a secret?

249
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,529
-No.
-Not even a little one?

250
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,072
-No.
-What if I just whisper it?

251
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,907
-No, I tells you.
-Oh!

252
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,495
<i>♪ I've been sitting</i>
<i>on the toilet ♪</i>

253
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,957
<i>♪ All the live-long day ♪</i>

254
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,710
BURNS: Is everything ready for
the secret meeting, Smithers?

255
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,711
SMITHERS: Yes, sir.

256
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,671
I hope no one
finds out about this.

257
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,798
It's pure journalistic dynamite.

258
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,343
Uh... sir, this place
could be bugged. Shh!

259
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:36,927
(dryer whirring)

260
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,387
OK, now we can talk.

261
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,056
(gasping)

262
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,015
Turn it off!

263
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,851
(groans)

264
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,980
Journalistic dynamite.

265
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,440
(gasps)

266
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,069
(speaking indistinctly)

267
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,153
Then it's agreed.

268
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,073
I'll supply you terrorists
with deadly uranium.

269
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,200
You are a credit
to the great Satan.

270
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,534
Oh, pshaw!

271
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,995
(humming)

272
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,955
HOMER: I love spying.

273
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,374
(groans)

274
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,542
Oh, don't worry
about those fumes.

275
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,878
They'll be sucked
into that air vent.

276
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,423
HOMER: Ohh!

277
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,928
This place is falling apart.

278
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,266
"And who's selling the uranium
<i>to </i>the terrorists?

279
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,018
Mmm?

280
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,271
Mm-hmm. "Montgomery Burns."

281
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,942
Now we wait.

282
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,821
(groans) Let go of me!

283
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,030
I'm innocent.

284
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,990
Whoa. He's in trouble.

285
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,911
We'd like to award this year's
Pulitzer Prize to Mr. X.

286
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,372
(cheering and applauding)

287
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,041
Unfortunately,
we don't know who he is

288
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:53,045
so his cash award will be used
to feed starving children.

289
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,297
No!
Move! Move!

290
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,800
I'm Mr. X! Gimme! Gimme!

291
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,136
(clamoring)

292
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,595
We'll need some proof.

293
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,389
Ta-da!

294
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,225
He <i>is </i>Mr. X. Hah!

295
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,227
Thank you, folks.

296
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,186
And now I'm off

297
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,064
to expose more secret
conspiracies and...

298
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,942
Ooh! Oh, I bit my tongue!

299
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,571
MARGE: I'm proud that
you won the Pulitzer.

300
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,739
Finally.

301
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,992
But I do feel bad
about the starving children.

302
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,827
They're with God now.

303
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,537
Oh. Well, that's good.

304
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,747
Oh.

305
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,542
Hey, guys, how's it going?

306
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,837
Oh, don't worry
about the Mr. X thing.

307
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,672
I'm just here for a beer.

308
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,674
(hesitates)
Uh, I don't know if I want you

309
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,468
in here no more, Homer.

310
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:44,263
I got a lot of secrets
I'd prefer to keep clandestine.

311
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,432
Terrible, disturbing secrets.

312
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,309
MAN: ...so hungry.

313
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,186
I smell another Pulitzer.

314
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,896
Yikes!

315
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,149
Well, Helen, as it says
in the Bible...

316
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,527
-I'll tell you later.
-Mmm.

317
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,365
Oh, nobody's visiting
my web page anymore.

318
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,618
My counter
is actually going down.

319
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,288
(wind blows)

320
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,749
Well, you can't post news

321
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,459
if you don't have any.

322
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,336
That's a great idea.

323
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,004
I'll <i>make up </i>some news.

324
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,257
(shudders) At least take off
your Pulitzer Prize

325
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,342
when you say that.

326
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,677
(humming)

327
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,179
-Let's see now.
-(growls)

328
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,349
"Bulletin-- New race discovered

329
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:32,353
living six inches under Denver."

330
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,396
Oh, Dad.

331
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,690
"All named Morton."

332
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,109
Or... "Mortonson."

333
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,321
This Mr. X says
Spanish and Italian

334
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,823
are the same language.

335
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,282
(exhales deeply)
Well, that's surprising.

336
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,619
They're controlling our minds
with flu shots.

337
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,995
I knew it.

338
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,664
Well, kids, now aren't you glad

339
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,040
we don't believe
in inoculations?

340
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,418
BOTH (shivering): Yeah.

341
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,212
Mommy?

342
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,965
Hey, Mr. X, I got a tip for you.

343
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,592
In science class,
they're dissecting frozen hoboes

344
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,219
and I have the bindles
to prove it.

345
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,346
Real news is great, son,

346
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,058
but I'm getting 1,000 hits
an hour with grade-A bull plop.

347
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,268
(bell chimes)

348
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,812
Give me 100 lotto tickets, Apu,

349
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,856
because Mr. X is on a roll.

350
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,650
(groans) Stop it, Apu.

351
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,277
You're scaring me.

352
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,611
(whining)

353
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,407
What's going on?

354
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,203
Help! I'm being kidnapped!

355
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,585
(humming)

356
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,795
(muffled talking)

357
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,256
(muffled)

358
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,341
Whoo! (sighs)

359
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,386
This is not a library. Whoo!

360
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,804
HOMER: Save me, Mr. X!

361
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,015
Wait. I'm Mr. X. (groans)

362
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,809
(Homer groaning)

363
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,352
(bird squawking)

364
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,313
Huh? Whuzza?

365
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,189
-(squawks)
-Hmm, hmm.

366
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,401
(birds calling)

367
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,403
(peacock squawking)

368
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,573
What the hell?

369
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,163
How did I get here?
What is this place?

370
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,249
This is the island.

371
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,334
How do I get out of here?

372
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,920
Oh, no one leaves the island.

373
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,797
So I'm a prisoner? How come?

374
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,925
Because you know something.

375
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,092
But I don't know anything.

376
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,344
At least I don't think I do.

377
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,762
See you tomorrow.

378
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,180
No, you won't!

379
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,431
Hello, operator?

380
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,017
I'd like to report
a really weird island.

381
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,977
Please send lots of rescue
'copters to...

382
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,354
(hissing)

383
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:43,442
(groggily)
Oh, well, all right. Whatever.

384
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,443
(thuds)

385
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,403
(snickers)

386
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,032
(groans)

387
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,703
Welcome, friend. I'm Number Six.

388
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,121
I'm number 15.

389
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,623
What number are you?

390
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,124
I am not a number.

391
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,167
I am a man

392
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,335
and don't you ever...

393
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,628
Oh, wait, I'm Number Five.

394
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,880
Ha-ha, in your face, Number Six!

395
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,632
Yes, well done.

396
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,884
Who are all these oddballs?

397
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,428
Well, they keep us here
because we know too much.

398
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,556
Number 27 there knows how
to turn water into gasoline.

399
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,810
Number 12 knows the deadly
secret behind Tic-Tacs

400
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,479
and I invented
the bottomless peanut bag.

401
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,064
Wow!

402
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,483
So, who brought us here?

403
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,567
I don't know.

404
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,945
-Did <i>you </i>bring us here?
-No.

405
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,032
Don't worry.

406
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,326
If even half of your
husband is out here

407
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,120
Officer Scraps will find him.

408
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,372
Oh, that's a darling
name for a dog.

409
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,001
(barks)

410
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,004
(barking)

411
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,968
Yep, he's on the trail,
all right.

412
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:54,013
-Uh-oh.
-(barking frantically)

413
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,389
Better go fish him out, Lou.

414
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,348
OK, Chief.

415
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,686
Uh, the shoes are
part of the uniform.

416
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,979
Right, Chief.

417
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,565
(groans)

418
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,237
(groans)

419
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,866
Oh, they drugged the tea.

420
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,577
They knew my one weakness.

421
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,579
(hydraulic whirring)

422
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,624
Hello, Number Five.

423
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,876
How's every little thing?

424
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,003
Who are you and why are
you holding me here?

425
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,922
I want answers now
or I want them eventually!

426
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,507
Fair enough.
I'll level with you.

427
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:31,884
(groans)

428
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,386
Ow. Please, don't do that.

429
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,305
-Sorry.
-I'll be blunt.

430
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,724
Your web page has
stumbled upon our secret plan.

431
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,892
That's impossible.

432
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,852
All my stories are bull plop.

433
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,312
Bull plop!

434
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,563
Don't be cute.

435
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,066
I'm referring
to the flu shot expose.

436
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,776
You see, we're the ones
loading them

437
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,694
with mind-controlling additives.

438
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,112
But why? (grunts)

439
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,574
To drive people
into a frenzy of shopping.

440
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,827
That's why flu shots are given
just before Christmas.

441
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,204
Of course.

442
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,081
It's so simple.

443
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,248
Wait. No, it's not.

444
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,625
It's needlessly complicated.

445
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,877
Yes, it is.
And we can't have you out there

446
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,212
mucking it up, now, can we?

447
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,296
No, sir.

448
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,297
There's a good boy.

449
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,715
Let's get you some ice cream.

450
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,051
There we are.

451
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,055
Look, you can drug me
all you want

452
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,389
but my family won't rest

453
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,266
till they find
my drug-bloated corpse.

454
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,727
I wouldn't count on that,
Number Five.

455
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,187
As far as your family knows

456
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,439
Homer Simpson is walking
in the front door

457
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,650
right about now.

458
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,444
I'm sorry. What?

459
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,029
(humming fretfully)

460
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,572
(gasps) Homie!

461
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,450
(German accent) Marge, honey,
<i>fraulein, </i>I'm home.

462
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,369
You're not my husband.

463
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,163
Jah, please forgive
my unexplained two-week absence.

464
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,414
To make it up to you

465
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,292
we will go out to dinner
at a sensibly priced restaurant

466
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,628
then have a night
of efficient German sex.

467
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,297
Well, I sure don't
feel like cooking.

468
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,554
(hissing)

469
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,930
Oh...

470
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,267
(buzzing)

471
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,269
Aren't there any evil movies on?

472
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,271
Maybe something
about an evil island?

473
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,481
There's something really
different about you, Dad.

474
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,651
I am a new tie wearing.

475
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,986
Oh, yeah.

476
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,071
(Homer groaning)

477
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,282
I'm tired of being
drugged and gassed.

478
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,992
There's got to be a way
to escape.

479
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,535
-Psst.
-Huh?

480
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,079
I've worked on this
for 33 years.

481
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,498
It's made out of
toilet paper rolls

482
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,584
toothpicks and plastic forks.

483
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:32,588
And the sail is made
of scabs and dynamite.

484
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,007
It's small and it's smelly

485
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,967
but it should carry
both of us to...

486
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,261
-(groans)
-Whoo-hoo!

487
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,349
Tha-that's the third time
that's happened.

488
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,024
Oh, no, an anti-escape orb!

489
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,155
(groans)

490
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,866
(grunts)

491
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,034
Huh. That was easy.

492
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,623
Why did you think
a big balloon would stop people?

493
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,041
Shut up, that's why!

494
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,210
Ooh! What a horrible
four months!

495
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,669
Now to warn everybody.

496
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,714
Attention, some crazy creeps
on an island somewhere

497
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,549
are secretly running the world.

498
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,636
-Hey!
<i>-Sorry, old chap</i>

499
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,387
<i>but you're proving</i>
<i>quite the caterpillar</i>

500
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,722
<i>in our buttermilk.</i>

501
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,474
-Huh?
<i>-We're shutting you down.</i>

502
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,558
Not a chance.

503
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,435
No one can silence me but me.

504
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:31,313
That arranged can be.

505
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,314
Wha...?

506
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,107
(gasps)

507
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,318
(gagging)

508
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,905
<i>Yes, fight and struggle.</i>

509
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,615
(grunts)

510
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,910
If I know me, he won't like
being kicked in the crotch.

511
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,371
(in German) <i>Gott im Himmel!</i>

512
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,414
(in English) Oh, Marge, it's me,
The real Homer.

513
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,541
Oh, Homie!

514
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,210
Mmm-mm.

515
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,254
(slow clapping)

516
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,674
<i>Bravo, Number Five.</i>

517
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,593
<i>But you know what happens</i>
<i>to bad little fishies</i>

518
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,136
<i>who wriggle through the net?</i>

519
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,554
Can I turn this off?

520
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,473
-Absolutely.
<i>-Hey!</i>

521
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,058
Nice to have you back, Homer.

522
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,351
(barking)

523
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,061
The dog thinks so, too.

524
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,479
(all laughing)

525
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,231
"The dog thinks..."

526
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,732
(all groaning)

527
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,567
Bad dog.

528
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,446
(laughing gaily)

529
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,282
Once you get used
to the druggings

530
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,075
this isn't a bad place.

531
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,952
Oh, it's wonderful.

532
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,413
Truly God's country.

533
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,455
(snickers)

534
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,040
(hissing)

535
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,501
HOMER (sinisterly):
See you on the island.

536
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,462
LISA (robotically):
Yes, the island.

537
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,011
(theme music playing)

538
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,551
Shh!
