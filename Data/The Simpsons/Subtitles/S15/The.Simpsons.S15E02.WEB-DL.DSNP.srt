(tires screeching)

6
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:31,364
It’s too nice a day to be
outside doing chores.

7
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,241
Come in and watch TV.

8
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:36,077
Whoo-hoo!
Mom finally stopped caring.

9
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,829
Don’t go inside--
it’s a trap!

10
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,457
Yeah, she must have some kind
of super-chore in there.

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,667
Like getting the rat
out of Maggie’s room!

12
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,796
I’m not fooling around,
people!

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,174
Park your keisters
in front of that TV!

14
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,175
Now!

00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,602
This counts as a bath!

Bart, you’re not at school.
Don’t swear!

38
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,144
I’ll trade you for a tote bag
that says "PROZAC."

39
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,606
No, thanks. I’m wearing
my cure for depression.

40
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,441
Come on, give me
that shirt.

41
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,944
I’ll put you at the top

42
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,196
My heart is fine.

43
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,573
It could always be
a little better.

Honey, this is your
moment in the sun,

45
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,454
and I couldn’t be more
pleased for your happiness.

46
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,916

Okay.

57
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,692
Get ready to laugh.

"Cranford Man Missing."

59

What’s he missing?

60
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,823
His pants? A train?

61
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:37,907

62
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,619

All right.

I think I’d like some
whipped cream on my Wyoming.

67
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,799
Dad, the word’s "desert,"
and those farmers are suffering.

too much hot fudge?

69
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,845

71
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,348
Come on, Bart,
show me some love.

72
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,601
Don’t drag me down
with you, old man.

73
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,977
Aah.

74
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,977
Aah.

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,199

76
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:23,244

83
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,843

Marge, wake up!

88
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,105
The newspaper
is talking to me!

89
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,774
Oh, relax.

90
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,693
I’m sure it’s just
your brain going crazy.

91
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,986
I wish!

92
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,279
Look at this headline.

93
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,573
Someone,
or something, knows

94
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,993
I love oversized food
and short, punchy articles.

95
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,747
So, they hid a message in
the first letter of each line.

96
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,210
See: "HOMER, MEET ME
4th STREET OVERPASS, MIDNITE."

97
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,921
Wait a minute.
This is today’s paper.

98
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,631
That meeting is tonight!

99
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,133
Don’t tell me
you’re actually going.

100
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,510
Marge, I don’t know
what this is,

101
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,929
but sometimes you’ve just
got to go with your gut.

102
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,139
You always
go with your gut.

103
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,975
This time, why don’t
you listen to your brain?

104
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,518
All right, I will.

105
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,522
(ukulele playing)

106
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,565
That’s why I don’t
listen to my brain.

107
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,818
And away we go!

108
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,987
(worried grunt)

109
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,988
HOMER:
Psst!

110
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,239
Hey, pal.
Hey, buddy.

111
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,448
Wake up.

112
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,368
Want to go on an adventure
with your old man?

113
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,619
(yawns)

114
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,829
No.

115
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,289
You have no choice.

116
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,040
There’s coffee
in the thermos.

117
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,335
(groans)

118
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,589
This is boring.

119
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,841
Can’t we go home?

120
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,509
This overpass
smells like urine.

121
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,510
They all do.

122
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,594
<i>Fresh </i>urine.

123
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,055
Hey, the bathroom’s
a block away.

124
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,807
-(zips up fly)
-WOMAN: Homer Simpson!

125
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,850

126
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:09,851

127
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,228

128
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,232
WOMAN: Aw, still
my little crybaby.

129
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,692
I’ll save you, Dad!

130
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,235
Ka-ra-te!

131
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,159
Grandma!

132
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,953
Oh, Bart, are you still
a little hell-raiser?

133
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:29,954
Yes’m.

134
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,581
Mom, you’re back!

135
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,624
Just like you were
back before,

136
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,959
then you left me again.

137
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,961
I love you so much,

138
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,630
but it’s so hard for me
to trust you.

139
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,424
Oh, what the heck.

140
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,800
Give me a hug, you.

141
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,552
Homer, you’re
hugging a bum.

142
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,055
I know! I’m working
my way up to you.

143
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,557
Hey! Give me back my wine!

144
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,976
(chuckles sheepishly)

145
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,229
(electrical buzzing)

146
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,690
Sorry about all
the cloak-and-dagger, Homer,

147
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,359
but the government
is still after me

148
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,651
for what I did
in the ’60s.

149
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,820
They’re probably tapping
your phones

150
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,739
(whispering):
and reading your mail.

151
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,990
(scoffs)

152
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,825
I think the government
has better things to do

153
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,160
than to read my mail.

154
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,538
Most people write letters
to movie stars.

155
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,749
This Simpson guy
writes to movies.

156
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,460
"Dear <i>Die Hard </i>, you rock.

157
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,338
Especially when that guy
was on the roof.

158
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,424
P.S. Do you know <i>Mad Max </i>?"

159
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:27,095
To reach you, I called up my
friends in the liberal media

160
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,056
and planted that story
about the giant pizza.

161
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,141
You sure know me, Mom.

162
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,228
Pizza was the first food
he choked on.

163
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,229
Aww.

164
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,064
So, why are you back in town?

165
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,526
I saw this macaroni
pencil-holder Homer made me,

166
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,195
and I realized how much
I missed him.

167
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,781
I made this when I was five.

168
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:47,865
I had to do something--

169
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,034
your pencils were
all over the place.

170
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,786
Hey, it was the ’60s.

171
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,081
(all gasp)

172
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,625
Is that fugitive radical
Mona Simpson?

173
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,378
Yeah, and that’s Tokyo Rose
mopping the floor.

174
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:05,174
Hey, Joe, your girlfriend
sleeps with Tyrone Power.

175
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,760
Chief, I think
we’ve got a match here.

176
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,387
All right,
let’s check it out.

177
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,098
But if you’re wrong,
you and Lou
have to kiss each other.

178
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,433
Chief, I checked
with the union.

179
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,434
You can only
do that once.

180
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,435
Aah.

181
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,064
Cora, is there a back

Your Honor,
can you please focus

00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,123
I’m sorry,
my wife left me this morning.

237
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:45,543
Now, I’m not a man

You got to say something,

239
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,847
she’s looking
at 20 years,

240
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,142
and my legal license
expires in 15 minutes.

241
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,144
I barely know my mother.

242
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:06,439
And every time I see her,
she’s taken away again.

243
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:10,943
And when a man doesn’t have
his mother, he winds up like me.

244
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,194
ALL: Aw!

245
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,697

00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,906

247
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,242

251
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,339
Your Honor, there is no way we
can find this defendant guilty.

252
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,506

253
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,426

the jury room cold cuts.

261
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,940
what a pistol.

262
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,653
A mere nod in her direction,
and the refill was in the mug.

263
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:59,742
The jets in the whirlpool
anticipated my every move.

264
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,410

265
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,996

on trial!

269
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,300
I never want to
let you go.

270
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,345
Mom, I never want to
let you go.

271
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,930
I’m not your mother.

272
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:25,017
Look, lady, just keep hugging
till we get to Mexico.

273
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,018
Mother...

274
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,020
Go hug your floozy.

275
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,106
Mother,
she’s right here.

276
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,024
She knows I’m kidding.

277
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,275

I’m not kidding.

use a few huffs from
your ether bottle.

283
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,039
Oh, man, that’s good "E."

284
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,375
Well, now that
I’m free,

285
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,002
I intend to be a better
mother to my son.

286
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,170
Whoo-hoo!

287
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,631
I can be a little boy again!

288
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,217
A boy who gets
some on the side.

to come back to me.

291
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,724

292
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,935

310
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,490

They never found
his head.

317
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,962
Mrs. Simpson,
when you took off,

318
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,714
you left a hole
in Homer’s heart

319
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,593
that he’s been trying to fill
with alcohol for 20 years...

320
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,844
God bless you.

321
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,306
Welcome
to your room, Mom.

322
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,307
I want you

323
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,975
to stay here forever.

324
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,977
Homer, it’s perfect.

325
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,897
Doesn’t this armoire
belong to Mr. Flanders?

326
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:41,362
You stole this entire room
from Ned Flander’s house.

327
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,614
Oh, well,
you snooze, you lose.

328
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,242
But can I have
my photo albums back?

329
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,286
Now get out
of my house!

330
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,290
And so in the spirit
of fence-mending
and grudge-not-bearing,

331
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,961
I hereby rename
the Burns Germ Warfare Lab

332
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,505
The Grandma Simpson
Peace Museum

333
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:03,926
and Kid-teractive
Learnatorium.

334
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,345
(cheering)

335
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,556
Grandma Simpson,
will you be the first

336
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,683
to sign the museum’s
guest book?

337
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,518
It’d be a real pleasure.

338
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,521
You know, when
I was on the run,

339
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,314
I always had to
sign a fake name,

340
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,817
like when I visited
a state park...

341
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,734
Indeed.

342
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,570
How about a national park?

343
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,697
Why, yes.

344
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,740
I’ve got it all
on this dictabelt.

345
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,950
Move in, boys.

346
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,954
(guns cocking)

347
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:32,955
What’s going on?

348
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,999
Supplying
false information

349
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:38,794
on a national park register
is a federal offense,

350
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,796
which you’ve committed
at every national park,

351
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,548
from Acadia to Zion.

352
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,467
You’re going away
for a long time, Mrs. Simpson.

353
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,344
Or should I call you...

354
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,804
Anita Bong-Hitt?

355
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,435
No! I can’t lose
my mother again!

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,605
Don’t take her away!

(continued sobbing)

359
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,406
Stop messing with him.
The man lost his mother.

360
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,741
Just one more time.

361
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,742
(chuckling):
Okay.

362
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:10,784
It is pretty funny.

363
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,745
Aw.

How do you figure?

373
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,993
She was acquitted,

374
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,663
then they put her back in jail
on a technicality.

375
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,206
You’re right.

376
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,084

00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,007
with a candlelight vigil.

381
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,427
Candlepin Bowling?
That’s a great idea!

382
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,347

Geez, pal.

402
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,270

Homer! What on earth
are you doing?

405
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,450
-(buzzing)
-Mom, I love you.

406
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,784
I can’t let you
go to prison.

407
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,202
Who’s the wheel man,
Granny?

408
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,787
It’s my son, Homer.

Aw...

(embarrassed chuckling):
Oh... st... stop it.

413
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,006
Take care, ladies.

414
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,215
I’m sure
you can make it back

415
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,508
to the prison
on your own.

416
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,218
ALL: We will.

00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,095
You’re all right,

420
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,642
Mom, I’m gonna hide you

421
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,686
where there’s no one
around for miles--

422
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,355
Disney’s California
Adventure.

(sirens wailing)

424
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,651
BOTH: D-ohh!

425
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,986
Homer, get out now,

426
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,654
and no one will ever know
you were involved.

427
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,199
No! You’re my mother,
and I won’t leave you.

428
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,493
If you stay here,
you’ll be abandoning
your family

429
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,786
the way
I abandoned you.

430
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,663
(chuckles):
Yeah...

431
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,665
That did mess me up
pretty bad.

432
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,334
But I’m not gonna leave you.

433
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,169
I see you’ve made
your choice.

434
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,837
I love you, Homer.

435
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,880
(electronic zapping)

436
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,924
-(grunts)
-(horn honks)

437
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,509
Oh, that’s lucky.

438
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,136
Aah! Oh, brambles!

439
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,137
Briars!

440
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,764
Nettles! Thorns!

441
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,184
(sirens wailing)

442
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,895
Granny to the Man,
Granny to the Man.

443
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,772
This is the Man.

444
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,732
I think it’d be a gas

445
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,401
if you turned that
magic bus around

446
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:35,030
and kept on truckin’
to our pig pad.

447
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,783
I don’t know what you’re saying,
but I am not turning back.

448
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,660
Then listen to me, lady,
the only way

449
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,703
you’re getting off this mountain
is in a box.

450
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,080
Or a funicular.

451
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,331
What about
a hot air balloon?

452
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,916
Yeah, pipe down,
Jules Verne.

453
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,837
Go Mom! You can do it!

454
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,215
No...!

455
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,097
There’s still air
in that bus,

456
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,516
so for the next five minutes,
this is a rescue mission.

457
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,601
(explosion)

458
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,019
Make that
a salvage mission.

459
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,772
(loud rumbling)

460
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,191
Okay, everyone take
some free time,

461
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,694
and we’ll see you tomorrow
at 10:00.

462
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,414
Grandma, you’ll always
be an inspiration to me.

463
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,833
You taught me a criminal
can evade the law

464
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,585
well into old age.

465
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,670
Thanks
for the meatloaf recipe.

466
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,589
I claim it as my own.

467
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,176
Mona, I’ll always remember
raspberry trolley cars,

468
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,469
because my mind is shot.

469
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,932
Your last act as a mom
was to make me a better dad.

470
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,852
But at least now
I’ll never lose you again.

471
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,106
-(tires screeching)
-Whoa! Look out!

472
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,816
Oh!

473
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,287
Homer, it’s 2:00
in the morning.

474
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,664
I couldn’t sleep because
I thought there might be a sign

475
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,499
of my mom
in one of these articles.

476
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,751
They never did
find her body.

477
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,252
Then what was
in the coffin?

478
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,630
Last week’s garbage--
I missed the pickup date.

479
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,841
But it doesn’t matter,
because my mom is alive! See?

480
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:21,053
"I, M, O..."

481
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,262
"...K."

482
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:26,767
Get it? "I am okay."

483
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,519
Okay, Homie,
if it makes you feel better,

484
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,813
I think your mom’s
all right, too.

485
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,191
Hey, as long as
we’re thinking about her,

486
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,651
Grandma’s still alive.

487
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,487
