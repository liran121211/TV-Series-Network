Come on, Marge, I’m not
the only selfish person.

178
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,827
<i>You </i>have to get your hair
done at "Supercuts."

179
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,121
I guess regular "Cuts" just
isn’t good enough for you.

180
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,207
You just don’t
get it, do you?

181
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,501
Christmas is a time
to think of others,

182
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,128
but today you showed you
only care about yourself.

183
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,463
That’s not true.

184
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,757
I cared what you thought
once you found out.

185
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,051
You can sleep
on the couch tonight.

186
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,303
Can’t you yell at me now
and get it over with?

187
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,096
No. I’m going to parcel
my anger out

188
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,182
over the next
few days and weeks,

189
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,893
jabbing at you just when
you seem the most content.

190
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,187
(groans)

191
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,189
I don’t need her.

192
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,816
I’ve got <i>you, </i>Astrolabe.

197
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,538
<i>Santa was in an awful pickle.</i>

198
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,456

203
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,677
Jimmy Stewart as a puppet

<i>And now back to Mr. McGrew’s</i>
<i>Christmas Carol.</i>

205

00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,424

what day is this?

240
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,520
It’s Saturday,
December 6th.

241
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,105
Thank God!

242
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,774
There’s still four more days
till Christmas.

243
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,484
I have time
to reform my ways.

244
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,819
I just saw the greatest cartoon
of all time.

245
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,196
It was about a miser

246
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,240
who was visited by three ghosts
at Christmas.

247
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,118
And get this:
he learns a lesson!

248
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,412
Dad, what you saw
was <i>A Christmas Carol.</i>

249
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,415
It was written by
Charles Dickens 160 years ago.

250
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,542
Yeah, TV writers have been
milkin’ that goat for years.

251
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,004
<i>Reform, Ebenezer Urkel.</i>

252
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,840
<i>You have alienated</i>
<i>everyone who loved you.</i>

253
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,258
<i>Did I do that?</i>

254
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,177
<i>Report, Mr. Sulu.</i>

255
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,179
<i>Captain, there appears</i>
<i>to be some sort of spirit</i>

256
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,514
<i>from an Earth holiday past.</i>

257
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,808
<i>Mr. Scott,</i>
<i>fire photon torpedoes.</i>

258
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,601
<i>It’s no use, Captain!</i>

259
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,646
<i>He’s showin’ visions of me</i>
<i>future... God, I’m so fat!</i>

260
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,730
<i>I said fire!</i>

261
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,484
That last one looked
kind of good.

262
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,694
Marge,

263
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,487
TV and nightmares
have joined forces

264
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,613
to teach me a lesson.

265
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,615
From now on, I will
stop being selfish

266
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,367
and start being good.

267
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,870
In fact, I’ll be
the nicest man in town.

268
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,039
You’ve made that promise
before.

269
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,376
Yes, but this time
I’m sober... ish.

270
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,214
Well, the hobos sure will
appreciate our old clothes

271
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,507
and lima beans.

272
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,008
No need, Flanders.

273
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,052
I’ve already given them
<i>my </i>old clothes.

274
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,013
(mumbling)

275
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,598
Good-lookin’ group.

276
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,933
Oh, gee,

277
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,060
looks like this town
has a Good Sam log-jam.

278
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,938
These pants smell worse
than my old pants.

279
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,398
You’re welcome.

280
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,860
Listen, Lenny,

281
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,070
I know I was a pretty bad
Secret Santa,

282
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,321
so I wanted
to make it up to you.

283
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,074
Wow, a photo cube

284
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,200
with pictures of us!

285
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,244
And I filed down
all the sharp corners.

286
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,496
See, your eye
is completely safe.

287
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,040
Oh, wow,
it just stings a little!

288
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,628
(softly gasps)

289
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:38,424
Marge, do you want
this last pork chop?

290
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:41,093
I’ve dreamed of the day
you’d say that!

291
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,553
(happily sobs)

292
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:47,183
Oh, your thoughtfulness
tastes so good.

293
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,684
(sobs)

294
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,104
And tears are
the sweetest sauce.

295
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,441
All right, now you’re
starting to creep me out.

296
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,526
(organ playing softly)

297
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,867
(grunting)

298
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,830
(grunting)

299
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,415
Come on.

300
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,254
Why don’t you just take
my blood?

301
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,256
(whooshing)

302
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,466
Yes, I’m old.

303
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,053
Oh, very nice, Ned.

304
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,722
But, uh, I’m afraid you’re
a distant second this week.

305
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,099
HOMER: I’m not looking
for glory or wealth.

306
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,019
I’m just buying that stairway
to heaven Jesus sang of.

307
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,395
That was Led Zeppelin.

308
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,396
(scoffs)

309
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,023
Get back to your bong, hippie.

310
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,691
(chuckles)

311
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,947
Daddy, are you jealous
of Brother Homer?

312
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,115
Well, maybe just
a tad, Todd.

313
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,953
I’m jealous of girls ’cause
they get to wear dresses.

314
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,205
One problem
at a time, boy.

315
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,457
Homie, I’m so proud.

316
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,709
You changed more than
I could have imagined.

317
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,253
You’re even covering
your mouth when you burp.

318
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,838
Just like the Pope.

319
00:13:58,921 --> 00:13:59,755
(loud burp)

320
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,632
Being unselfish
is a natural high,

321
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,300
like hiking or paint thinner.

322
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,552
And here’s another act

323
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,638
of Christian charity
I pulled out of my butt.

324
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,850
I built a skating rink
for the whole town.

325
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,769
(groans)

326
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,274
Activate the cloaking device!

327
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,317
Hm. Oh, I’m so depressed.

328
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,861
Engage candy bar.

329
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,281

00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,715
<i>Homer Simpson, seen here</i>
<i>in this retouched photo.</i>

352
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:28,552
Ooh! That Homer
just burns my waffles.

353
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,722
Pain is the cleanser!
Pain is the cleanser!

354
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,808
(doorbell rings)

355
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,478
Excuse me,
my car broke down.

356
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,980
Why, I’ll give you a jump.
I’ll rotate your tires.

357
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,231
I’ll even fold up
that map for you.

358
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,858
I know they can be a dickens
of a doozy.

359
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,943
Back off, creep!

360
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,070
I was looking
for Homer Simpson’s house.

361
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:46,946
(groans)

362
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,074
That tears it.
I’ll show Homer.

363
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:54,286
I’m gonna be the nicest man
this world has ever seen.

364
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,288
B...

365
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,792
I said "man," not "man-God."
Keep your pants on.

366
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,876
Here you go,
Principal Skinner,

367
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,877
Mrs. Skinner.

368
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,671
You’re actually giving
everyone in town

369
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,713
a Christmas present?

370
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,006
What’s your angle,
pervert?

371
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,217
Oh, my angle is
givin’ in this world,

372
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,551
livin’ in the next.

373
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,429
But how can you afford all this
on a widower’s salary?

374
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,057
Well, actually,
I picked up some extra cash

375
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,351
renting out my house
to a fraternity.

376
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,937
<i>(music playing,</i>
<i>people talking)</i>

377
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,439
<i>ROD: Stay out</i>
<i>of our medicine cabinet!</i>

378
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,149
Pathetic Flanders.

379
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,236
Thinking he can buy people’s
love with thoughtful gifts.

380
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,737
Cool. Mr. Flanders gave me

381
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,656
a Krusty-brand Operation game.

382
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,532
(buzzer)

383
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,867
<i>Oh, you just tweezered</i>
<i>my wang.</i>

384
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,910
I’ll show Flanders.

385
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,912
I’m gonna get everyone a car.

386
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,665
What’s that one good
American car?

387
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,542
Dad, you don’t have
to out-do Mr. Flanders.

388
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,377
Just remember the spirit
of the season.

389
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,920
Uh... is it despair?

390
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,422
Actually, most people now

391
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,382
feel Christmas has gotten
too materialistic.

392
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,591
In fact, as a Buddhist,

393
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,386
I believe people would be a lot
happier without presents.

394
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:56,390
Hmm. You’ve given me
a lot to think about.

395
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,394
LISA: <i>People would be a lot</i>
<i>happier without presents.</i>

396
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,981
Presents are material goods,

397
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,151
and attachment to material goods
kills the soul.

398
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,570
(police siren blaring)

399
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,280
I’m not going to jail again!

400
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,281
(tires squeal)

401
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,615
I’ve got it!

402
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,368
When everyone’s asleep,
I’ll take away their presents.

403
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,538
Then they’ll be happy.
Thanks, Buddha.

404
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,998
I got your badge number.

405
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,958

I never get out.

Ho, I’ve been robbed!

418
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,266
Man, so this is how it feels.

419
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,562
I’d better see my shrink...
and rob his ass.

420
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,524
Someone snuck in
and took our presents.

421
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,483
(gasps)

422
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,734
Do you think
it was Papa?

423
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,653
I wouldn’t put it past him.

424
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,446
He stole my gold tooth
the night he left.

425
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,615
He didn’t leave,
he went to the store.

426
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,449
And when he comes back

427
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,035
I’ll wave those Pop-Tarts
right in your face.

428
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,871
They don’t sound happy,
but here comes a mob

429
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,415
shaking their fists
in gratitude.

430
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,542
(all yelling)

431
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,794
Give back our presents,
stupid man!

432
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,420
Your behavior, it’s like--

433
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,297
it’s like, not sanctioned
by any governing body.

434
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,924
You’re like, wild.

435
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:57,136
Um, shouldn’t you all be
singing carols or something?

436
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,429

00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:03,433

438
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,518
Stop!

439
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,311
Friends,
what Homer did was wrong.

440
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,813
But, uh,
I’ve been thinking.

441
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:11,150
Maybe <i>I </i>was just as wrong
to give you those gifts.

442
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,860
-(groaning)
-Hey!

443
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,153
Wait a minute, everyone!

444
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,114
There’s your Christmas,
up there.

445
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,284
(all gasp)

446
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,035
It’s a miracle!

447
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,289
That’s my last flare.

448
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,416
Somebody’d better come soon.

449
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,917
(howling)

450
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,296
Oh, thank goodness--
rescue dogs!

451
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,214
(growling)

452
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,758
FLANDERS:
"And the angel said
unto them, ’Fear not,

453
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,553
for, behold, I bring you good
tidings of great joy,

454
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,762
which shall be
to all people...’"

455
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:41,763
QUIMBY:
Stop that!

456
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,057
You can’t pray
on city property.

457
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,646
Let’s just say that on this day,
a million years ago,

458
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,108
a dude was born who most of us
think was magic,

459
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,527
but others don’t,
and that’s cool.

460
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,321
But we’re probably right.

461
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,322
Amen.

462
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,323
ALL: Amen.

463
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,825
And now, I think the only thing
left to do is

464
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,911
return all your gifts! Ned?

465
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,746
It’d be my pleasure, Homer!

466
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,498
(all happily yelling)

467
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,335
Oh, oh, joy.

468
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,128
Let’s see what we’ve,
uh, got here.

469
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,546
Oh, it’s a new brassiere.

470
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,175
But I don’t even have them--
but okay, I’ll make pretend.

471
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,593
What a great Christmas.

472
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,763
Not even Moe’s annual suicide
attempt can ruin it.

473
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,808
I ain’t got all day,
drama queen.

474
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,185
Get it over with.

475
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,020
I will,
and then you’ll all wish

476
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,480
you was nicer to me.

477
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,648

478
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,274
