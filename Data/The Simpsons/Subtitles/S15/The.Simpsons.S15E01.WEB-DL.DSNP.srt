00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,349
and slept with
Marilyn Monroe
by night

183
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,102
and sold secrets to
the Russians at lunch.

184
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:02,023
The last time I saw him alive,
he was going to study sharks.

185
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,483
I don’t want to go

186
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,818
on this oceanographic
expedition, Father.

187
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,778
I get seasick
taking a shower.

188
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,572
Clean but nauseous.

189
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,741
"Clean but nauseous,"

190
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,284
with the rolling
and the heaving

191
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,952
and the you make me sick.

192
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,748
You’ve disgraced the name
of John Nerdlebaum Frink.

193
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,584
-But, Father, I...
-(boat horn blows)

194
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,962
(cries)

195
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,756
We never spoke again.

196
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,424
Well, where is he now?

197
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,594
Maybe I can help you two
patch up your differences.

198
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,263
Uh, you’ll need to patch up
more than that.

199
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,268
(gasps):
Did a shark do that?

200
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,103
Yes, he was testing out

201
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,190
a new blood-based
suntan lotion.

202
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,526
You know, now that I have
my hammer-screwdriver

203
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,069
I could reanimate him

204
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,488
without the needless
switching of tools.

205
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,533
That’s always tedious
and annoying.

206
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,785

00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,420
I’m alive!

209
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,922
With the breathing
and the tingling

210
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,883
and the what’s this radiator
where my pupik should be?

211
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,636
Oh, Papa,
you’re back!

212
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,348
Now, we had to replace
several vital organs
with machinery,

213
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,475
but that doesn’t make you
any less of a man.

214
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,603
Except you have no penis...

215
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,230
in the traditional sense.

216
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,774
So, what am I,
some kind of a tin can man

217
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,150
from Planet Tomorrow?

218
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,737
Sir, your son has brought you
into the 21st century.

219
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,406
It’s a lot like the 20th,

220
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,909
except everybody’s afraid and
the stock market is much lower.

221
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,245
Polly don’t like
that cracker.

222
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,997
I’m getting me
a real spleen,

223
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,207
and then I’m gonna vent it
on you, boychik.

224
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,627
Oy! Shoving.

225
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,463
It almost sounded like
he plans to tear organs

226
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,215
out of living people.

227
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,967
Well, that’s my dad.

228
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,176
You can’t stop him.

of homosexuality.

234
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,523
Say "ah," baby.

235
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,524

And Milton Berle?

242
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,454
Boy, have I been barking up
the wrong tree.

243
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,042

new ways to disappoint me.

Have you stopped
to think about

254
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,949
who you’re hurting
with this rampage?

No. Your son!

<i>Batman and Rhoda...</i>

359
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,030
(gasps)

360
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,448
Check out these ads!

361
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,782
Let see, X-Ray Gum...

362
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,783
(gasps)

363
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,951
Cool.

364
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,620
Milhouse, do you have
your change purse?

365
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,829
MILHOUSE:
Always!

366
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,164
(doorbell rings)

367
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:19,376
Here you go, son.

368
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,837
"To stop time, click watch."

369
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,464
(ticking)

370
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,884
(ticking stops

371
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,636
Wow, she looks like
a background character

372
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:32,139
in a Hanna Barbera cartoon.

373
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:36,393
"To restart time,
click watch again."

374
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,937
What the...?!

375
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,356
Lisa,
that’s a filthy habit.

376
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,149
(chuckles maniacally)

377
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,567
If we’re both
touching the watch,

378
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,818
neither of us
will be affected.

379
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,957
Do you realize
what this means?

380
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,043
Yeah...
but you say it first.

381
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,795
We can do anything we want!

382
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,506
Let’s get really far
ahead on our homework!

383
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,882
Wait till
the other kids see

384
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,592
we’re already
on the red unit

385
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,636
of <i>Adventures In Reading.</i>

386
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,971
(moans)

387
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,722
SKINNER:
Due to budget cuts,

388
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,308
music class will now have
a two-drink minimum.

389
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,103
Cranapple juice
only counts as one. And...

390
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,901
(gasps)

391
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,112
My slacks!
They’ve descended!

392
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,656
(laughing)

393
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,659
(quiet giggle)

394
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,747
What the...?
Ooh.

395
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:44,378
D-oh!

396
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,587
I can’t go on.

397
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,172
(whimpering, moaning)

398
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:54,346
(crying)

399
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,723
Haw...

400
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,057
Haw?!

401
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,685
(laughing)

402
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:03,897
(watch ticking)

403
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,402
People,
Springfield is in crisis.

404
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,446
Fingers have been
shoved up noses,

405
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,906
pants have been
pulled down, and...

406
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,160
Mayors... have... been...
repeatedly...

407
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,327
humiliated. Dammit!

408
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,038
(angry grumbling)

409
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,581
I thought
our mysterious pranksters

410
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,207
might be here tonight,

411
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,169
so I covered the meeting hall
with ultraviolet powder.

412
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,296
Behold the perpetrators!

413
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:31,425
(electrical buzzing)

414
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,093
(all gasp)

415
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,720
It was those guys!

416
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,097
Come! Let us kill them

417
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,724
before learning
of the magical secret

418
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,059
which they possess.

419
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,811
(angry yelling)

420
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,953
Oh, that was close.

421
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,872
Bart,
look at the watch!

422
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,666
Milhouse,
we broke the watch!

423
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,627
Do you realize
what this means?

424
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,755
Yeah...
but you say it first.

425
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,298
(clicking)

426
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,591
Oh, man.

427
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,551
Things are stuck
like this forever.

428
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,929
Well,
I couldn’t be happier.

429
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,264
I’m the second coolest kid
on earth!

430
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:23,018
(silly humming)

431
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,522
Actually, I guess
we can do anything we want

432
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,024
and no one will stop us.

433
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,652
I’m gonna play
naked basketball!

434
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,945
No, you’re not.

435
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,703
The family looks good.

436
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,621
Thanks.
I just washed them.

437
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,292
Oh, that keeps happening.

438
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,880
Can I punch
Oscar de la Hoya
for a while?

439
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:52,881
Just keep it
above the belt.

440
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,592
(grunting)

441
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,802
(sighs)

442
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,053
You know, Milhouse,

443
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,222
I thought I’d love
eating only frosting

444
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,015
and giving
the pope a wedgie.

445
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,310
But I miss being a regular kid
in the real world,

446
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,562
getting a hug
from my mom...

447
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,317
Yeah, I thought I’d be happy
with my parents back together,

448
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,153
but it’s kind of hollow.

449
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,659
All right.

450
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,995
It says here we can learn
watch repair in eight
one-hour lessons.

451
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,249
Boy, that took forever.

452
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,295
Yeah, well I work better
in a structured environment.

453
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,800
Here goes nothing-- Wait!

454
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,260
When people see
all the stuff we did,

455
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,261
they’re gonna kill us.

456
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,347
Yeah,
and I can’t run too fast

457
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,893
after 15 years of eating
nothing but Gummi Worms.

458
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,061
I’m gonna quit tomorrow,
I swear!

459
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,441
What we need
is a scapegoat.

460
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:02,034
Okay,
acting natural and...

461
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,703
(angry yelling)

462
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,580
To repeat
what I said a moment ago:

463
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,665
"You are so dead."

464
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:14,296
(grunts and groans)

465
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,049
<i>Dios Mio!</i>
This kid is fun to hit!

466
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,094
(whistling)

467
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:25,140
Mmm. Why is Bart so tall
and shaggy?

468
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,683
Just one of
life’s mysteries.

469
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,561
Like, why is my nose
jammed full of army men?

470
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,022
Oh, come on,
don’t you get it?

471
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,983
Bart stopped time
with his magic stopwatch.

472
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,360
Jealous much?

473
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,029
Why can’t I tinker with
the fabric of existence?

474
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,489
Let the baby
have her bottle.

475
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,371
Huh. What happens
if I press this button?

476
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,748
Lisa!

477
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:50,958
