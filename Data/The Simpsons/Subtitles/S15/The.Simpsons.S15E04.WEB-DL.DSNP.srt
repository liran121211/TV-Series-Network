00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,400
Prime Minister Tony Blair?

183
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,194
Why are you greeting lowlifes
like us at the airport?

184
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,363
Because I want to encourage
all the world

185
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,116
to come see the beauty
of 21st Century Britain.

186
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,285
Would an American dollar

187
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,870
encourage you
to leave us alone?

188
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,121
No, but thank you.

189
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,999
Tony... I mean,
Mr. Prime Minister...

190
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,625
what should we see first?

191
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,877
There’s so much to see here:

192
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,838
Parliament, Stratford-on-Avon,
the White Cliffs of Dover...

193
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,506
Oh, and you Americans
love castles--

194
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,008
there’s a huge one
in Edinburgh,

195
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,384
the city where I was born.

196
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,470
The place I was born
is now a gator farm.

197
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,471
Smashing.

198
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,472
Maybe you could give us

199
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,432
a personal tour
of your country.

200
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,642
I’d love to, but I’m late
for an appointment.

201
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,853
I’m greeting a lovely
Dutch couple at Gate 23.

202
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,146
Cheerio.

203
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,316

204
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,403
Wow, I can’t believe
we met Mr. Bean.

205
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,365
England is so classy.

206
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,993
Every cab
has its own butler.

207
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,495
Actually, I’m not a butler.

208
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,747
I had already hired this cab
when you got in,

209
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,124
but the more the merrier
and all that.

210
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,501
Make with the tea, Jeeves.

211
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,336
Yes, very good, sir.

212
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,341
We’re big-shot tourists

213
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,927
from everyone’s favorite
country: the USA.

214
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,095
We saved your ass
in Vietnam

215
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,014
and shared our prostitutes
with Hugh Grant.

216
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,474
So give me some free maps,

217
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,893
and none of that
dry British wit.

218
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,853
(dryly):
I wouldn’t dream of it, sir.

219
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,854
Thank you.

220
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,189
(groans)

221
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,775
Did you spend
an unforgettable night

222
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,694
with a soldier
from the U.S. Army in 1944?

223
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,530
You did?

224
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,698
Was he from the 1st
Infantry Division?

225
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,200
He was?

226
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,036
And was he a gentle,
caring lover?

227
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,329
He was?

228
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,790
Sorry I bothered you.

229
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,126
I don’t know
if I’m ever gonna find her.

230
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,548
Oh, Dad, I wish there was
something I could do.

231
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,550
Touch that mini bar
and you’re dead!

232
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,051
Oh...

author of
the Harry Potter books.

236
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,393
You’ve turned

237
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,019
a generation of kids
on to reading.

238
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,729
Thank you, young muggle.

239
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,107
Can you tell me what happens
at the end of the series?

240
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,568
He grows up and marries you.

241
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,860
Is that what you want to hear?

242
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,029
Yes.

243
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,117
All right, who’s hungry?

244
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,245

Well, Marge,
you got to admit,

I’ve been on my best
behavior this trip.

258
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,362
You punched out three people
on the street.

259
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,865
That was over
soccer results.

260
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,408
Can you believe
they gave Giggs

261
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,202
a yellow card
in the box?

262
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,871
Do you understand any part
of what you just said?

263
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,206
I understand
the word "gave."

264
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,375
Unless it means something
else in this country.

Word to the wise,

266
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,340
British candy is a bit sweeter

267
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,759
than what you’re used
to across the pond.

268
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,969

We thespians believe
it’s bad luck

00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,340
Dad, you rear-ended
the Queen of England.

361
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,925
The Queen of what?!

362
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,176
D-oh!

363
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,053
(grunts, screams)

364
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,388
(trumpet fanfare blares)

365
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,141
Changing of the guard.

366
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,226
(groans)

367
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,523
Wait, we have
to exchange insurance!

368
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,691
(screams):
Oh! Ow! Oh!

369
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,619
-(gavel bangs)
-Homer Simpson,

370
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,413
you are hereby charged
with damaging the Royal Coach,

371
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,207
and putting several dents
in the Royal Horse.

372
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,250
How do you plead?

373
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,418
Milord,

374
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,795
we Americans love queens,

375
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,131
be they homecoming or Dairy.

376
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,967
This woman, however,
is an impostor.

377
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,177
(gasping)

378
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,012
Her luggage is inscribed

379
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,181
"H.R.H.",

380
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,224
which means
her real name must be...

381
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,561
Henrietta R. Hippo..

382
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,689
Why did you let him
be his own barrister?

383
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,524
What difference
could it make?

384
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,652
He hit the friggin’ queen!

385
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,487
I guess
it’s just too much

386
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,697
for me to ask
for one vacation

387
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,201
where we don’t go to jail
or to a condo sales pitch.

388
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,537
Your Honor, I’ve completely
disappointed my wife.

389
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,581
That’s punishment enough.

390
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,041
You understand
these things.

391
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,125
You’re a grandmother.

392
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,211
I’m a man!

393
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:07,424
Oh! And a very manly one,
if I may say so, milord.

394
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,551
If I might say a word?

395
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,636
(gasping)

396
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,222
I haven’t had an easy life.

397
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,392
I’ve seen my country
ravaged by war,

398
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,811
my family torn by tragedy,

399
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,689
and then, as I was
innocently making my way

400
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,482
to the shops
to buy light bulbs,

401
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,192
I was blindsided

402
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,277
by this great,
lumbering brute.

403
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,697
Boy, she’s good.

404
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,907
If she were
100 years younger,

405
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,617
and I were
100 years older...

406
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,244
(lusty laugh)

407
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,038
If there is any love
left in you for me,

408
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,456
destroy him!

409
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,874
America rules!

410
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,376
Our Beatles are

411
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,337
way better than
your precious Rolling Stones!

412
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,183
In this cell
sits Homer Simpson,

413
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,687
the most villainous blackguard
to be held in this tower

414
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,647
since Edward the Puppy Eater.

415
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,274
(gasping)

416
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,277
Look at his great,
staring eyes.

417
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,154
Like saucers, they are!

418
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,489
(Cockney accent)
’E claimed he was me father,
’e did.

419
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,074
Bart, you’re not helping.

420
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,243
Poke the monster
with a stick!

421
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,411
Tuppence a jab!

422
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,288
C’mon, queue up, lads.

423
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,665
Oh, Marge,
I’m so sorry.

424
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,875
I should
have listened

425
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,169
to whatever
it was you were saying.

426
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,670
It’s partly my fault.

427
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,548
I’ve been nagging you
so much on this trip,

428
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,217
you couldn’t know
which nags to focus on.

429
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,178
Well, Marge,
if I die here,

430
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,096
there’s one thing
I want you to remember:

431
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,850
don’t buy
any videotapes in England.

432
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,852
They won’t work
in our VCR!

433
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,020
(sobbing)

434
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,024
Dear God of England,
please let me go.

435
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,777
In return, I will spell
the word "color" with a "u",

436
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,987
and I will use
the metric system

437
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,531
with every cubic milliliter
of blood in my...

438
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,949
Oh, I can’t do it.

439
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,201
It’s so stupid!

440
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,911
-LISA: Dad!
-Huh?

441
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,329
We found a secret tunnel

442
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,580
out of the tower.

443
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,333
It was used
by Sir Walter Raleigh!

444
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,877
A secret tunnel?
I don’t know.

445
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,129
Won’t that get me
in more trouble?

446
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,215
Homer, you couldn’t be
in more trouble.

447
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,467
They’re going to put
your head on a pike.

448
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,177
They’re practicing
with melons.

449
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,554
Smash it on.
Don’t worry it.

450
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,556
Let the pike
do the work.

451
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,141
Okay, what do I do?

452
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,728
Push the grey brick
in the back of the fireplace.

453
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,313
Sweet freedom,
here I...

454
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,523
(screams)

455
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,275
Put out the fire first.

456
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,281
Boy, it’s a good thing

457
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,033
I’m leaving
before I went nuts.

458
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,409
Good-bye, Sparkly Elves.

459
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,828
Good-bye!

460
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,041
Oh, my God!

461
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,751
We’ve made
a terrible mistake.

462
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,712
This tunnel comes out in the
worst possible place.

463
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,381
An elephant’s butt?

464
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,466
Yes, Bart,
an elephant’s butt.

465
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,845
Boy, a Krispy Kreme would
really clean up down here.

466
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,725
Hey, this place is amazing!

467
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,563
It’s fit for a duke,
or even an earl...

468
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,274
(gasps)

469
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,525
(blows whistle)

470
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,527
Uh-oh.
The queen’s in trouble.

471
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,655
And you didn’t want
to give her a whistle.

472
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,074
(screams)

473
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,659
Please, Your Majesty,

474
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,661
I know that I,
like many other Americans,

475
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,538
have behaved
like a total buffoon.

476
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,876
But we Americans
are England’s children.

477
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:32,421
I know we don’t call
as often as we should,

478
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,298
and we aren’t
as well-behaved

479
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,176
as our goody-two-shoes
brother, Canada--

480
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,970
who, by the way,
has never had a girlfriend.

481
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,597
I’m just saying...

482
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,184
But, please, find it
in your jewel-encrusted heart

483
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,560
to forgive me.

484
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,732
That was very sweet
of the queen,

485
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,650
letting you go
in exchange

486
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,736
for taking Madonna
back to America.

487
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,238
WOMAN (muffled):
I’m telling you!

488
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,032
I’m English!

489
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:03,619
Englishwomen
don’t pump gas naked.

490
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,621
See you
in Atlanta, jerk!

491
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,082
Abe Simpson,
are you leaving again

492
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,876
without saying good-bye?

493
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,961
Edwina,
you got my message!

494
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,379
Oh...

495
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,340
Sorry I never
saw you again.

496
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,759
I just felt
the cultural differences

497
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,802
between us
were too great.

498
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,513
Plus, as the boat
pulled away from the dock,

499
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,724
I thought
you looked fat.

500
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,602
You don’t have
to apologize, Abe.

501
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,729
You Yanks
saved our bacon.

502
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:31,772
Mmm!

503
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,523
Bacon!

504
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,651
D-oh!

505
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,363
Abe, this is
my daughter Abbey.

506
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,032
She’s 58 this month.

507
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,325
58?!

508
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,535
Well, 59 years ago,

509
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,788
your mother
and I were hav...

510
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,123
Oh! Well, gotta go!

511
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,959
See ya in heaven.

512
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,377
Dang!

513
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,213
Mummy, he’s everything
you said he was.

514
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,048
Lady,
you’re gorgeous.

515
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,842
You make Dame Edna
look like a dude!

516
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,678
Why, thank you.

517
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,888
You’re all right, love.
