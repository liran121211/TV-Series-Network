a bike like that...

00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,527
back before I was born.

41
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,778
Oh, no.

42
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,447
They've got big boy bikes.

43
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:56,866

I had a ten-speed bike.

00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,851
A ten-speed bike?

51
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,144
What did your mother say?

52
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,186
She said "yes."

53
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,521
MARGE:
I said no.

54
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,439
I'm confused. Which is it?

55
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,984
It's no.
His old bike is fine.

56
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,819
Yeah, the kitchen
lady's right.

57
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,988
No new bike while your
old one still works.

58
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,116
I see. So if my old bike
didn't work,

59
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,326
I would automatically
get a new one?

60
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,536
That's right.

61
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,997
No questions asked.

Snowball II,
I can't believe you're gone.

83
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,711
I wrote this poem for you.

84
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,172
It's called "Cat Math."

85
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,592
"Four paws plus one tail
plus nine lives

86
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,094
equals one special cat.

87
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:45,558
One special cat minus nine lives
equals one sad little girl."

88
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,727
(sobbing)

89
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,395
I know how you feel, Lis.

90
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,731
No kid wants
to outlive their pet.

91
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,274
(sobs)

92
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,027
Oh, Sweetie,
when I was your age

93
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,696
I lost my guinea pig
Cinnamon.

94
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,908
And I thought the pain
would never... (gasps)

95
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,410
(cries):
Oh, Cinnamon!

96
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,536
It should've been me

97
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,373
who chewed through
that extension cord.

98
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,626
There, there.
You're both right.

99
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,549
Son, would you like to ride
your new bike out of the store?

100
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,260
Can I, for true?

101
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,053
For true, son.

102
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,388
Hey, pally...

103
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,348
I don't want to downshift
your enthusiasm,

104
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,808
but that's
a floor model.

105
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,434
Your bike is in here.

106
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:32,522
I could put it together right
now for a small assembly fee.

107
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,648
Here we go.

108
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,359
Now it starts
with the fees.

109
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,319
I'll assemble it myself.

110
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,487
Dad, no.

111
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,072
Think of the bike.

112
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,533
I can make a bike.
I made you.

113
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,119
Yeah, great workmanship.

114
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,454
Hey, that's gonna win you
a lot of bar bets some day.

115
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,251
Oh, man, this is so confusing.

116
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,586

136
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,969
I brought a homemade
first aid kit.

00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:07,091
I wish I'd had bullies
like you growing up.

358
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,175
ALL:
Mm!

359
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,594
Hey! Hey!

360
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,929
These cats would rather
take their chances

361
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,557
in the back room
than go home with you.

362
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,268
(hissing)

363
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,523
My job was to keep
Lisa's hope alive.

364
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,693
But instead,
she's really depressed.

365
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,027
You think
you've got problems.

366
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,779
Look what I just pulled
out of my arm!

367
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,280
(gasps)

368
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,282
That's what we in the business
call "a biggie."

369
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,243
Business?
What business?

370
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,453
The business of being a dad.

371
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,163
Can you hand me that magnet?

372
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,540
Sure.

373
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,750
(clanking)

374
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,210
Can you do my back?

375
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,088
I guess I'm not meant
to own a cat.

376
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:50,300
I'm much happier
petting this leaf.

377
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,552
(gasps)

378
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,474
(demented raving)

379
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,646
Wait, you don't want me
to have this cat!

380
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,939
(demented raving)

381
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,445
Look, you don't want to get
involved with a girl like me.

382
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,780
My cats have a nasty habit
of waking up dead.

383
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,366
Now go. Cough me out
of your life

384
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,243
like a bad fur ball.

385
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,041
(tires screech)

386
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,006
You're not hurt!
You're a good-luck kitty!

387
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:32,259
All right!
Ol' Gil's gonna collect big
from insurance!

388
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,012
I'll be eating food tonight!

389
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,806
(humming happily)

390
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,434
(explosion)

391
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,019
I'm keeping you!

392
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,229
You're Snowball Five.

393
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,441
But to save money on a new dish,
we'll just call you Snowball Two

394
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,194
and pretend this whole thing
never happened.

395
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,528
That's really a cheat,
isn't it?

396
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,240
I guess you're right,
Principal Tamzarian.

397
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,744
I'll just be moving along,
Lisa. Snowball Two.

398
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,790
(explosion)

399
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,130
Okay, I've been studying
Frink's robot,

400
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,925
and I've discovered
he has one small weak spot.

401
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,468
This goes here.

402
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,098
Uh-oh. His weak spot
is now his strongest point.

403
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,432
(loud moan)

404
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,351
That moan sounded almost human.

405
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,478
HOMER:
The hell it did.

406
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,522
(rock music plays)

407
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,190
(round-bell rings)

408
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,865
(grunts)

409
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,368
(grunting)

410
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,495
(staccato grunting)

411
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,663

412
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,415

00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,751

416
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,387
You look a
little sluggish
out there, boy.

417
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,429
I'd better open you up.

418
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,681
(gasps)

419
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,474
Dad?!

420
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,809
Bart, I'm sorry.

421
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,602
I could never build a robot
this awesome.

422
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,770
I'm a fraud.

423
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,356
So, you fought
all those robots?

424
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,441
Affirmative.

425
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,693
That is so cool!

426
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,902
You really think so?

427
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,487
Yeah! Any Poindexter can throw

428
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,114
some nuts and bolts together.

429
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,158
You risked your own life,

430
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,578
even though you're the sole
provider for a family of five!

431
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,247
I am the luckiest kid
in the world.

432
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,916
And I'm the luckiest...

433
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,877
<i>ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>Round two!</i>

434
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,003
Oh, no!

435
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,379
Dad!

436
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,882
(gasps)

437
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,133
(gasping)

438
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,094
That robot has given birth
to a man!

439
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,097
Hey, what gives?

440
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,765
He's not killing me!

441
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,225
I'll tell you
what gives.

442
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,477
I'm afraid he is subject

443
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,689
to Isaac Asimov's
laws of robotics.

444
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,150
With the sci-fi
and the so many books,

445
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,651
not too many good.

446
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:58,530
My robot is programmed
never to harm humans, you see.

447
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,157
Only to serve them.

448
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,701
(gasps)

449
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,587
He knows just how I like
my martinis...

450
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,255
full of alcohol.

451
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,216
Go! Go! Go!
Now's your chance!

452
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,258
(chuckles)

453
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,385
Bart, all that
button ever did

454
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:24,306
was send a mild electric shock
up my backside.

455
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,432
Why did you make it
do that?

456
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,100
-(zapping)
-Keep me focused.

457
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,811
And the winner is nature's
greatest killing machine:

458
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,521
man!

459
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,398
(booing)

460
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,108
Show me where
in the rule book

461
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,402
it says that a human
can't be a robot.

462
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,446
Right here. Rule one.

463
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,114
Well, then...

464
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,659
Join us next week for
more inconclusive action

465
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,453
on <i>Robot Rumble!</i>

466
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,664
I concur!

467

(booing)

468
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,460
Son, did you ever suspect
it was me?

469
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,753
Well, you did disappear a lot,

470
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,922
but I've gone whole summers
without seeing you.

471
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:57,923
(laughs)

472
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,550
Yeah, I'm pretty unreliable.

473
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,010
I like you, Son.

474
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,429
I like you, too, Dad.
