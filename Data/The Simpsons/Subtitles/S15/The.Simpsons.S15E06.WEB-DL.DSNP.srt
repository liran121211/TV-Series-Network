00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,947
Yeah, right.

183
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,365
My father will put this

184
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,993
in a spiritual-philosophical
context.

185
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,703
I’ll tell you why
you didn’t have a Bar Mitzvah.

186
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,704
It’s because you’re a putz!

187
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,289
Everything is
a joke to you.

188
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,582
I was afraid
you’d make a mockery

189
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,083
out of the whole ceremony...

190
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,543
like you’re making a mockery
out of me right now!

191
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,921
Maybe I am, but you can’t argue
with the laughs.

192
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,842
Eh, so what? It’s not my job
to make kids laugh.

193
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,427
Yes, it is.
You’re a clown.

194
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,804
Oh, without a Bar Mitzvah,
I’m nothing!

195
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,016
(sobbing)

196
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,602
Krusty, you can still have
your Bar Mitzvah as an adult.

197
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,811
That’d be great!

198
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,398
Are you sure
that’s Kah-sher?

199
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,817
There’s nothing in the Talmud
that forbids it.

200
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:47,985
How do you know
all this stuff?

201
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,904
I have a Jewish
imaginary friend.

202
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,156
Her name is Rachel Cohen,
and she just got into Brandeis.

203
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,908
Wonderful!

204
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,160
( <i>lively show theme music</i>
<i>playing </i>)

205
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,790
Hey, hey, kids!

206
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,208
I’ve got a confession to make.

207
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,377
Underneath
all this plastic surgery,

208
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,003
I’m actually a Jew,

209
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,048
and from now on,
I’m embracing my faith.

210
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,883
(cheering)

211
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,260
What’s not to like?

212
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,928
And now I’ll teach you
my traditions

213
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,847
the way my people have passed
them down for centuries...

214
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,808
through animation.

215
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,894
<i>(klezmer music playing)</i>

216
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,984
<i>(reciting a Hebrew prayer)</i>

217
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,780

218
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,242

<i>(squeaks)</i>

221
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,174
<i>Mouse-l Tov!</i>

222
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,677
And that’s
what I believe in now.

223
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,262
(chuckling)

224
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,558
Krusty, that was
a great show.

225
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,768
Once I was clapping, and the
applause sign wasn’t even on!

226
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,520
Hey, that’s great,
but I got a problem.

227
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,397
This schedule has me
working on Saturdays.

228
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,982
That’s the Sabbath!

229
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,317
Well, we could tape
two shows on Friday.

230
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,776
Are you nuts?!

231
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,653
I can barely get through
one show on Friday,

232
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,863
even with the...

233
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,698
(sniffs)

234
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,285
Uh, you know, smelling flowers.

235
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,496
Such expensive flowers...
filled with remorse.

236
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,457
Anyway, we got to book
a guest host.

237
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,125
How about Jon Stewart?

238
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,544
He’s a son,
a lover, and a pundit

239
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,463
rolled into one sexy package.

240
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,881
(growls)

241
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,175
He’d be perfect,
so forget it!

242
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:37,678
I need a guest host so bad,
he can never replace me.

243
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,430
I need someone
who’s not intelligent...

244
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,182
-Mm...
-not good-looking...

245
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,142
-(gasps)
-and so utterly repellent, he...

246
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,143
I’m your man!

247
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,354
(grunting)

248
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,357
Man, are you unpleasant.
You’re in.

249
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,608
(door shuts)

250
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,444
Children, I wish to announce

251
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,364
that our show has undergone
a reformatting.

252
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,199
(cheering)

253
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:02,495
Let’s get ready
to listen quietly!

254
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,746
ALL:
Yay!

255
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,331
Now, tonight’s guest host...

256
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,333
the ultimate place-holder...

257
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,626
Homer Simpson!

258
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,630
Welcome to
the <i>Homer Simpson Show.</i>

259
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,590
I’m your host... next card...

260
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,759
Homer Simpson.
It’s great to be here

261
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,220
in... next card... Springfield.

262
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,346
My guests are...

263
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,473
Moe Szyslak,
local businessman;

264
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,017
Carl Carlson,
raconteur;

265
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,186
and Lenny Leonard,
three-time juror.

266
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,814
Gentlemen,
what’s on your minds?

267
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,030
Dad, you have
to say something.

268
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,281
Something meaningful.

269
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,411
You ever notice
how seats are too small

270
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,788
for normal-looking guys like me?

271
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,790
Theaters, airplanes...

272
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,375
Why, even here. Look!

273
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,876
(straining)

274
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,503
-(grunting)
-(grunting)

275
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,587
I could not agree more.

276
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,588
(grunts)

277
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,465
Never go on the teacup ride

278
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,469
after eating at Beauty and
the Beast’s Fried Dough Chateau.

279
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,679
Hey, I got a question.

280
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,055
How come oldies stations

281
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,266
are always playing
the same song?

282
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,894
How ’bout some new oldies,
geniuses?

283
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,313
Boy, these guys
are right on the money.

284
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,649
Yeah, my neck is sore
from agreeing so much.

285
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,151
Hey, baby!

286
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,652
You lookin’
for a good time, huh?

287
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,905
Go home, turn on your
television, Channel 6!

288
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,532
Thanks for the tip!

289
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,660
Yeah, yeah,
twins, I get it.

290
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,246
Now, let’s watch something
I’m really interested in.

291
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,499
<i>Who has more power,</i>
<i>Miss America or Miss U.S.A.?</i>

292
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,043
<i>I think one’s elected</i>
<i>and the other one’s appointed.</i>

293
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,670
I think your water
just broke.

294
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,963
Will you be quiet?!

295
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,095
Now, you can’t mix
milk and meat.

296
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,597
You got that?

297
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,932
And on Christmas day,
you must eat Chinese food,

298
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,934
and pork
is strictly forbidden.

299
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,311
Uh-oh.

300
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,520
All these rules...

301
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,272
I feel like
I’m in a strip club!

302
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,109
Well, Dad,
what do you want
to talk about tonight?

303
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,444
Hmm...

304
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,613
Uh, listen, Homer,
I’d like to raise an issue.

305
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,031
Why so formal, Lenny?

306
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,407
You’re my go-to guy.

307
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,617
Well, about that,

308
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,243
you know, I’ve been
with the show

309
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,162
from the beginning,
and I was, uh... was wondering

310
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,956
if I could get a-a small
cost-of-living raise.

311
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,083
Interesting...

312
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,628
Please welcome new panelist,
Barney Gumbel.

313
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,505
Oh, that light’s
a little bright.

314
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,714
Do you think you could move it?

315
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,468
Please welcome our newest
panelist, Disco Stu.

316
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,385
Tsk!

317
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,806
Disco Stu knows his place.

318
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,267
My husband’s a power-mad star.

319
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:34,814
Maybe now we can get that
padding that goes under rugs.

320
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:39,318
"Ha-ma-shel be-khol-a-sher-la
sim-na yad-kha ta-khat..."

321
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,820
Very good!

322
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,613
You just earned
yourself a Dr. Brown’s.

323
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,198
Krusty,

324
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,325
you know Diane, Stu,
and Jeremy from the network.

325
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,202
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

326
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,120
Krusty, we’ve got some bad news.

327
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,872
We think
you’re super-talented...

328
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,958
Oh, God, you’re canceling me!

329
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,545
Krusty, Krusty,
TV is a fickle business.

330
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,338
You’ve had a good run,

331
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,173
but Homer Simpson’s
a fresh face, and...

332
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,758
You’re not doing this
fast enough.

333
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,884
You’re fired, too.

334
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,970
I’m... No!

335
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:10,933
(sobbing)

336
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,275
Ah, Simpson,
I hate to bother you

337
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,360
when you’re eating,
but you’re always eating.

338
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,320
Will you sign an autograph
for my boy?

339
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,197
My pleasure.

340
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,907
I eat Legos.

341
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,868
So did I, son.

342
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,828
And look
where I am today.

343
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,747
Boy, everybody loves my show.

344
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,874
It’s great, Dad.

345
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,584
You have tremendous power.

346
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,794
And now it’s time
to put it to use.

347
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,005
Yes, you’re right.

348
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,467
Duck, Mr. Lincoln!

349
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,598
Thank you, Homer.

350
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,059
No, Dad.

351
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,061
I mean, you should use
your time on the air

352
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,063
to say things that
really mean something.

353
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,566
Change the world
for the better!

354
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,402
I say live fast, die young,
and leave a big fat corpse.

355
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,530
Well, I took Bart’s advice
last week,

356
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,824
so I guess it’s Lisa’s turn.

357
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,243
Now, if you’ll excuse me.

358
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,501
You hit him high,
I’ll hit him low!

359
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,629
(grunting)

360
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,756
(chuckling)

361
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,094
Look, since my own network
dumped me,

362
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,055
I thought maybe
I could do a show on...

363
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,473
(groaning)

364
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,849
Fox.

365
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,309
Well, I’m sorry, Krusty.

366
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,311
People aren’t interested
in stars anymore.

367
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,812
They want reality.

368
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,813
Way ahead of you.

369
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,315
How about a show

370
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,525
where girls think
I’m a millionaire?

371
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,112
But what they don’t know is,
I’m rife with disease.

372
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,114
Okay, okay.

373
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,575
How about one where I move in
with a poor family

374
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,576
and laugh at ’em?

375
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,786
(chuckles)

376
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:54,995
You see, be...

377
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,042
Okay, how about
you televise my Bar Mitzvah?

378
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,710
Live!

379
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,214
Please. You people are known
for taking chances on crap.

380
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,926
You know, we’ve had a great time
on this show

381
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,553
"riffing" on small,
unimportant subjects.

382
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,763
Now, wait a minute.

383
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,974
Dirty words you can spell
on your calculator

384
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,351
is a very important subject.

385
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,352
(chuckles)

386
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,269
Boobs.

387
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,314
(laughing): That’s
just like what girls got.

388
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,400
Well, that’s all over now.

389
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:28,362
From now on, we will focus
solely on important issues.

390
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,863
Every year,

391
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,616
the gulf between rich
and poor nations gets larger.

392
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,368
Yet, the IMF insists

393
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:38,330
on unrealistic
debt-repayment schedules.

394
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,665
This show stinks!

395
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,667
I knew my son would blow it.

396
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,043
Where’s the remote?

397
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,256
Oh, it might as
well be in China.

Now let’s meet a man
who’s muscle-bound,

414
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,174
and a man who’s bound not
to eat mussels,

415
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,885
Mr. T and Krusty the Clown.

416
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:37,097
T, I haven’t seen you
since we roasted Chevy Chase.

417
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,599
Yeah, we were
kind of rough on him.

418
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,767
I felt bad
for that guy.

419
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,393
You pitied the fool?

420
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,603
That’s one way
of putting it.

421
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:43,562
Time for me
to get into character.

Why should America consume 90%
of the world’s resources?

427
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:06,502
Argentina must devalue
her currency to pay her debts!

Dad, you blew it.

432
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,927
You listened to Lisa.

433
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,053
And then you lost
your stranglehold

434
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,179
on the audience.

435
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,847
