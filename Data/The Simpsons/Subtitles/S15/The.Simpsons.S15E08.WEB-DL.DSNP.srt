00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,128
I hear ya.

180
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,337
Some days are tougher
than others.

181
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,047
Just close your eyes and club.

182
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,843
This is it, boys.

183
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,721
We'll have to tummy-kiss
our way out!

184
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,600
(sounds of tummy kissing
and blowing raspberries)

185
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,144
There's a bouncy one here,
Chief.

186
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,315
<i>BROCKMAN:</i>
<i>Baby's got backlash!</i>

187
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,983
Springfield citizens
are outraged

188
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,944
about the destruction
caused by the bad babies.

189
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,070
Bad babies.

190
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,947
Yes, you was.

191
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,241
They destroyed my home...

192
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,870
and the equity
I'd built up therein.

193
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,747
Asked if he intends
to take legal action,

194
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,457
the farmer replied,
"I ain't fungified

195
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,918
hidee-hoo 'bout no
legrification no ways,"

196
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,795
then scratched his rear,
hitched up his pants...

197
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,422
and scratched his rear again.

198
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,757
<i>QUIMBY: That riot</i>

199
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,467
has far-reaching consequences.

200
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,470
Kabul refuses to be
our sister city anymore.

201
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,971
I have no sister city!

202
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,306
(grunts)

203
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,142
The babies' damage
exceeds $1 million,

204
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,603
which will now be sucked
out of your pockets.

205
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,980
(air rushing)

206
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,357
MAN: My loose change!

207
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,110
Let me now introduce a woman
who wants to make sure

208
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,112
that what I just did
never happens again.

209
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,614
Good evening.

210
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,782
I'm Lindsay Naegle,

211
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,451
and I am the founder
of SSCCATAGAPP,

212
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,329
Singles, Seniors, Childless
Couples, and Teens, And Gays

213
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,081
Against Parasitic Parents.

214
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,917
-(crowd murmuring)
-Catchy name.

215
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,254
We're tired of picking up the
bills for other people's kids.

216
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,674
We already pay millions
every year in school taxes.

217
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,300
(crowd shouting angrily)

218
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,927
Excuse me, everyone.

219
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,928
I'm a mother.

220
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,555
(crowd booing)

221
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,014
And I'm an American!

222
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,349
(cheering)

223
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,560
I bake apple pies.

224
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,561
(cheering)

225
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,938
And I love baseball!

226
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,606
(booing)

227
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,110
Save your breath for blowing up
water wings, breeder.

228
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,778
I dream of an America

229
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,656
with nudity and "F" words
on network TV,

230
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,575
where the whole world
doesn't stop

231
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,326
because a school bus did.

232
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,328
Children are the future.

233
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,998
Today belongs to me!

234
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,791
(crowd cheering)

235
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,294
You can't change the rules
in the middle of the game!

236
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,962
We never would've had these kids

237
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,171
if we thought
we had to pay for them.

238
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,424
Promises were made!

239
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,842
Hey, tough tortellini!

240
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,344
I'm sick of printing
children's menu.

241
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,431
Let Mickey Meatball find
his own way out of the maze.

242
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,724
Pooey!

243
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,059
We're tired
of buying overpriced tickets

244
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,437
for your lousy school plays.

245
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,481
Then how would we ever
get to see <i>Camelot?</i>

246
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,026
We'll merely watch
the movie on tape.

247
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,360
Is that better?

248
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,031

That's the battle cry

are continuing to run roughshod
over children and families.

270
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:08,250
From now on, children acting up
in public places

271
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,169
will be lightly Tased.

272
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,088

I wasn't kidding.

275
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,135
And in downtown Springfield,

Just a statue?

00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,979

Oh, yeah. Mm.

293
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,349
Ms. Naegle, I'm sorry
to surprise you like this,

294
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,601
but I thought if we met
face-to-face,

295
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,687
we could settle
our differences.

296
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,188
Well, let's make it quick.

297
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,399
I know you have to get back
to your kids,

298
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,317
and I'm late
for a skydiving massage.

299
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,777
I'll cut to the chase.

300
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,029
I brought with me
the very best reason

301
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,324
I can think of
for what I believe in.

302
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:26,162
Her name is Lisa,
and I wouldn't trade her

303
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,164
for all the sleep-in
Sundays

304
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,416
and speed dating
in the world.

305
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,711
Ms. Naegle,
even though I disagree
with your principles,

306
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,755
I certainly admire
your success.

307
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,882
Well, Lisa, I would be proud

308
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,801
if one of the eggs I sold
turned out like you.

309
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,969
Mmm.

310
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,013
Mom, I locked your keys
in the car.

311
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,723
Then wait in the shadows!

312
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,600
Also, Maggie puked
in your purse again.

313
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,018
Poor me.

314
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,813
All my purse is full of
is disposable income.

315
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,231
Sorry, Marge,

316
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,984
I don't think I'll ever
understand your point of view.

317
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,736
Not even with all my free time.

318
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,405
Then I guess
this means war,

319
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,366
with the most powerful
weapon at my disposal:

320
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,494
a voter-sponsored
initiative.

321
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,329
(gasps):
You wouldn't dare!

322
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,290
I've already drawn up
the petition.

323
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,541
(dramatic chord plays)

324
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,169
Well, I'm not worried.

325
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,337
You won't get that thing
on the ballot

326
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,381
until the November
general election.

327
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,262
(tires screeching)

328
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,723
No, the March primary.

329
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,018
(dramatic chord plays)

330
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,728
Mom, can we get
a pretzel?

331
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,063
We've got pretzels
at home.

332
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,439
Not cinnamon.

333
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,067
(dramatic chord plays)

334
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,197
Well, we finally
got things

335
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,365
the way we want them.

336
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,449
Not a highchair

337
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,701
or complimentary
crayon in sight.

338
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,286
I'm going to tell
an anecdote

339
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,371
about love making,

340
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,956
without having
to look around.

341
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,667
Truly we have entered
a golden age.

342
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,961
(shouting)

343
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,671
Attention, everyone.

344
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,260
I wish to announce
the formation of PPASSCCATAG--

345
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,054
Proud Parents Against
Singles, Seniors,

346
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:10,432
Childless Couples
and Teens and Gays.

347
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,601
"Pupasscatag" is also
a disease of the brainstem.

348
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,103
That's how I'll remember it.

349
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,437
(chuckles)

350
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,107
To overturn these horrible
anti-family laws,

351
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,777
we've prepared the "Families
Come First" initiative.

352
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,573
Now, the first thing
we're going to need is money.

353
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,741
(crickets chirping)

354
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,410
I'm so sorry, Marge,

355
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,246
but I guess you get the bill.

356
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,581
(crickets chirping)

357
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,708
Oh, for the love of pizza.

358
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,418
Luigi Risotto?

359
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,711
That's-a me.

360
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,754
I'm from the U.S.
Immigration Department.

361
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,883
(crickets chirping)

362
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,509
Save our families!

363
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,344
Sign our petition!

364
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,929
The only petitions
that I sign

365
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,432
are to bring back
canceled sitcoms, thank you.

366
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,559
America needs the wisdom
of <i>Herman's Head</i>

367
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,477
now more than ever.

368
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,645
Well, howdy, ma'am.

369
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,647
I represent
the Tobacco Lobby,

370
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,442
and frankly, no politics
gets done in this country

371
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,110
without a little help from us.

372
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,445
(gasps)

373
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,781
Now we own you!

374
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,200
But I haven't endorsed it yet!

375
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,203
Football injury.

376
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,288
(chuckling)

377
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,624
Now why don't you just
sign the check?

378
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,667
(wailing voices)

379
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,878
Forget it.

380
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,631
(screams)

381
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,635
I guess no one gives a damn

382
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,054
about the American
family anymore.

383
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,931
I'll sign
your petition.

384
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,349
Mr. Burns?

385
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,893
You care about children?

386
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,144
Yes.

387
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,355
Particularly
their supple young organs.

388
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,817
Oh, unfenced back yard pools,
where would I be without you?

389
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,111
Hey, if Burns is
signing that petition,

390
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,947
maybe we should, too.

391
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,741
Yeah, rich guys always want
what's best for everyone.

392
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,665
Coming up later,

393
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,875
what your dog can tell you
about your prostate.

394
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,876
Mm.

395
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,379
But first, Marge Simpson's
"Families Come First" initiative

396
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,005
seems to be gaining steam,

397
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,175
leading her opponents to counter
with this commercial.

398
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,136
As a mother, I love my family.

399
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,513
That's why I'm against

400
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,723
the "Families Come First"
initiative.

401
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,893
"Families Come First"
will hurt families,

402
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,313
and I love my family
too much for that.

403
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,773
I'm Marge Simpson,

404
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,609
and even I'm against
"Families Come First."

405
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:29,029
Now it's time to do some coke
off the blade of a knife.

406
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,241
Hmph! That ad makes me look
like a criminal.

407
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,701
Then why did you appear in it?

408
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,952
That wasn't me.

409
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,079
Maybe she was you,

410
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,247
and you're not!

411
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,456
How many kids
do we have?

412
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,457
Three.

413
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,792
Wrong, lady!

414
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,669
Oh, wait, the baby.

415
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,379
<i>MARGE:</i>
<i>I try my best.</i>

416
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,922
They ridicule me.

417
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,800
They mock everything
I cherish.

418
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,719
Honey, this marriage
is a partnership.

419
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,388
When you fall, I pick you up.

420
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,473
And when you can't
finish a sandwich,

421
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,351
I eat that sandwich.

422
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,603
You're my rock, Homie.

423
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,523
And I promise this rock
is going to weigh you down

424
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,400
for the rest of your life.

425
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,484
Aw...

426
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,447
Honey, no one messes
with my missus.

427
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,240
I'll come down on those guys

428
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,451
like the garage door
on Bart's bike.

429
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,827
What are you
going to do?

430
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,079
You just leave
everything to Homer.

431
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,791
And now, I believe you
owe me half a sandwich.

432
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,503
I always keep one
near the bed for you.

Many childless advocates

famous, successful people

We're just piggybacking

I am Rudy Giuliani.

456
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,520
Do as I command you.

It says "Yes on 232".

460
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,658
We want no on 232,

461
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,743
Yes on 242.

Either way.

463
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,746
The important thing
is the system works.

And the bumper stickers
misspelled "on."

They all say "Yes No 242".

466

And it's the night
before the election,

467

Lis, kids are the problem,

00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,782
maybe kids
can be the solution.

480
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,367
Okay, but how?

I just had my most
brilliant idea ever.

00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,378
Don't you mean

490
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,759
Because we're kids.

491
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,844
(snaps)
Kids!

492
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:39,970

Aw, such
a sweet little thing.

504
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,785
Time to destroy your future.

505
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,747
