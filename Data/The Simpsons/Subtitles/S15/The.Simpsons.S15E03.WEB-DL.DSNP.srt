(theme song plays)

00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,719
D-ohh!

4
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:11,720

(Polorid moto sound)

7
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,281
Oh, boy, Casino Night!

8
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,116
Finally, they’ll teach our kids

9
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,452
the dangers of
doubling down on a six.

10
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,203
I really
shouldn’t be here--

11
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,247
I have a problem
with games of chance.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,999
I played Candyland
with Maggie

13
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,251
and ended up throwing vodka
in her face.

14
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:46,796
Aw, Marge, I bet you’ve gotten
that out of your system.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,841
Bet... system...
betting system!

16
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,469
God is telling me to gamble!

00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,678
-Hey!
-Hey!
-Hey!

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,016
Deal! Hit me! Hit me! Hit me!

19
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,101
Busted!

00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,102
(squeals)

21
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,440
Welcome to Springfield
Elementary Casino Night.

22
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,816
My fee for this evening

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,860
goes to victims of my
criminal recidivism.

24
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,361
So, relax, have fun

25
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,238
and please, God,
don’t piss me off.

26
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,825
Congratulations.
Mr. Student Body President.

27
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,827
Your Casino Night
is a huge success.

28
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,454
Thanks, Principal Skinner.

29
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:22,123
I got the idea from an episode
of <i>Saved By The Bell.</i>

30
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,209
Mm, that was always on too
late for me.

31
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:29,089
I’ll put everything
on lucky 17.

32
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,715
D-ohh, d-ohh, d-ohh, d-ohh,
d-ohh, d-ohh, d-ohh!

33
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,716
Whoo-hoo!

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,926
D-ohh, d-ohh, d-ohh,

35
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,135
d-ohh, d-ohh, d-ohh, d-ohh,
d-ohh!

36
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,136
Whoo-hoo!

37
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,555
D-ohh, d-ohh!

38
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:44,229
D-ohh!

39
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,940
Whoo-hoo!

40
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,900
And the winner is...
17!

41
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,276
I win!

42
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,654
This is it, baby.

43
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,738
First thing tomorrow,

44
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,532
we’re getting
a PlayStation One!

45
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,533
Ooh...

46
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,869
I’d like to cash in
these chips.

47
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,371
Give me most
of it in cash

48
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,207
and the rest in
suitcases to carry the cash.

49
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,876
Sir,
this casino is for charity.

50
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,587
These chips are only redeemable
in cafeteria scrip

51
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,173
or a day at the ballpark
with Groundskeeper Willie.

52
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,551
I’ll be bringin’ sparkplugs

53
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,053
to chuck at people
I don’t like, like you!

54
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,932
But I’m up $200,000!

55
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,433
Give me my money!

56
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,186
You think I won’t
manhandle a little boy?!

57
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,314
You don’t understand--
it’s not real money!

58
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,817
None of these people
have won any money!

59
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,485
ALL: Huh?!

60
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,029
Didn’t anyone read the flyer?

61
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,906
It was sent home last Tuesday.

62
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,868
(yelling)

63
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,161
(screaming)

64
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,204
Look at me! I’m a big man!

65
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,251
But I break...
just like a little girl.

66
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,794
(clamoring)

67
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,591
Well, this was a disaster.

68
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,009
I should have known.

69
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,511
The same thing happened
on <i>Saved by the Bell.</i>

70
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,888
Care for a milk?

71
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,347
No, thank you.

72
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,932
Martin, in light
of this fiasco,

73
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,310
you’re going to have
to resign as president.

74
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,770
(choked up): I will have
that milk now.

75
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,232
Easy there. That’s whole milk.

76
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,193
I’m a private citizen now.

77
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,320
I can drink what I like.

78
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,615
You won’t have Martin Prince
to kick around anymore.

79
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:24,787
(military drum
and bugle dirge)

80
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,248
Well, I guess we’re gonna need
a new student body president.

81
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,417
We’re from
Acme Amusement Rental.

82
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,544
We’re looking
for Principal Skinner.

83
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,589
Uh... yes, we all are.

84
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,382
Whoo...

85
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,384
(humming)

86
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,053
Ohh.

87
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,639
Hey, student body president.

88
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,851
I could join past presidents

89
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,519
like Otto or Krusty.

90
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,941
Nelson, <i>you’re </i>running
for President?

91
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,693
I’m not saying I have
all the answers,

92
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:59,155
but I do have all the
answer <i>keys </i>to every test.

93
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,281
(students clamoring)

94
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,282
Fractions?

95
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,367
Dinosaurs?

96
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,534
Foreign money?

97
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,994
The first Thanksgiving?

98
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,163
Nelson,
what are you doing?

99
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,998
Real estate license exam?

100
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,875
My ticket to freedom!

101
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,336
ALL (chanting):
Nelson! Nelson!

102
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,420
(sotto voce):
I’m doomed.

103
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,421
(Lisa sighs)

104
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,340
I can’t beat Nelson.

105
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,968
Why don’t you start
a rumor that he’s...

106
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,386
ding-a-ling-a-ling!

107
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,971
(high-pitched, singsong):
Hello!

108
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,099
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho,
what a delicious quiche!

109
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,892
I drive a pink Miata.

110
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,853
I can’t believe Nelson
is more popular than me.

111
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,772
♪ La, la, la, la, la,
la, la... ♪

112
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,816
Honey, you can be popular.

113
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,776
You’ve just got
to be yourself...

114
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,653
in a whole new way.

115
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,738
No, I’m gonna stick
to my platform

116
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,241
of incremental policy
amelioration:

117
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,993
fluoridated water fountains,

118
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,828
vegan lunch options...

119
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,663
(falsetto):
My name is Nelthon!

120
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,747
I use a thalad fork.

121
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,832
La-dee-dah!

122
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,083
I wash my face.

123
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,668
Where did you get that tutu?

124
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,086
(normal voice):
Clothesline.

125
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,171
(crazed laughter)

126
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,757
...and we deserve

127
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,010

130
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,641

I’m worried.

163
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,753
This girl is extremely popular
and thinks for herself.

164
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,339
She’s like a female
Eleanor Roosevelt.

165
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,800
Yeah, the students will do
anything she says.

166
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,427
She’s captured
their imagination

167
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,470
like a bright piece of
construction paper.

168
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,930
Hmm, yeah.

169
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,266
We’ve got to find a way
to control her.

170
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,768
Hey, maybe that escaped
mental patient

171
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,313
you hired has some sort of
toxin in his shack...

172
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,773
Yes, hello, Willie.

173
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,192
Well, if you ask me,
a woman’s weakness

174
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,069
is her sense of vanity.

175
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:29,115
Vanity? You might have
something there, Edna.

176
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,242
So, when’s my inauguration?

177
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,577
Hmm, let’s see...

178
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,496
When hell freezes over,
tough guy.

179
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,500
You wanted to see me?

Actually, Lisa,
I wanted you to see you.

181
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,589
You’re our president now,

182
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,675
but you look like
the First Lady of "yawn."

183
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,678
What would you change?

184
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,431

204

Oh, Lisa, you look
so successful.

205
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,530
Like you’re the wife
of a businessman.

206
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,616
I wish I had married
a businessman.

207
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,785
Then I’d have nice things.

208
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,912
Well, it’s a little
over the top,

209
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,997
but there’s no reason
I can’t look good

210
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,667
and take back the playground
from the gypsies.

211
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,088
Is our Frisbee now.

212
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,383
Hey, Lisa, can I get
a photo for the front page?

213
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,594
It’ll either be a picture
of you or the drinking fountain

214
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,304
that won’t stop running.

215
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,973
Make it snappy, Milhouse.

216
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,059
I’ve got an important meeting
in the teachers’ lounge.

217
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,644
The teachers’ lounge.

218
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,689
Is it true they make fun
of students in there?

219
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,190
Oh, don’t be silly.

220
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,693
GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE:
Look at me, I’m Milhouse.

221
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,820
I’ve tucked me shirt
into me underpants!

222
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,154
(teachers laughing)

223
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,365
I’ve got no friends,

224
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,284
so I confide in Willie!

225
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,535
(laughing harder)

226
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,329
(nervous chuckle)

227
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,665
(laughter continues)

228
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,292
Oh, hello, Lisa.

229
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,710
We were just, uh...

230
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,712
discussing Vasco Da Gama.

231
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,755
Well, I have some ideas
for ways

232
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,300
we can improve
the classroom experience.

233
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,385
We need to get teachers
more involved.

234
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,262
Have them meet
with struggling kids

235
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,097
in the morning before school.

236
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,891
Fine. I’ll come in early
to meet with students.

237
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,185
And I’ll have
hypnotherapy when?

238
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,063
Or, we could hand out teachers’
home phone numbers

239
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,941
so kids can call them whenever
they have questions.

240
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,235
I’ve got a question:
You’re crazy.

241
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,029
Look, in the Swedish
public schools,

242
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,197
the students grade the teachers
on their performance...

243
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,741
Outstanding notions!

244
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,075
Each more implementable
than the last.

245
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,077
It’s a shame you can’t stay
to discuss them.

246
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,704
Here’s your schedule
for the day.

247
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,539
"Photo op helping
kindergartners

248
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,207
take off snow boots..."

249
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,710
"Move the brushfire
hazard needle..."

250
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,921
Um, shouldn’t I stay here
and work on school policy?

251
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,924
Lisa, you were elected
to be seen and enjoyed.

252
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,719
Don’t hide your light
in a smoky back room,

253
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,262
making dusty
old decisions.

254
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,555
(giggles)

255
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,183
Well, I am proud of my light.

256
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,560
But just in case you want
to do any more thinking,

257
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,603
I’m proud to present you

258
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,313
with an official key
to the study hall.

259
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,522
(gasps)

260
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,524
Use it anytime you like.

261
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,361
You mean I can come
to the school after hours,

262
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,196
weekends,
even during the summer?

263
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,989
Yes, it’s like
you’re Harry Potter

264
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,658
without the magic
and wonder.

265
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,409
Just sign these
authorization forms,

266
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,619
you can be on your way.

267
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,582
(chuckles)

268
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,000
That little girl should learn

269
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,794
to read things
before she signs them.

270
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,545
Excuse me?

271
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,381
I was wondering
if I should read
what I just signed.

272
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,800
Oh, it’s just standard key
release boilerplate.

273
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:16,842
Okay.

274
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,178
Boy, she’ll believe anything.

275
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,721
Key release boilerplate?

276
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,306
I find that very hard
to believe.

277
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,684
Mm-hmm, and yet there it is.

278
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,103
I’ll just lock this door.

279
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,188
Boy, this key opens
everything.

280
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,231
(groans)

281
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,983
And then, as school president,

282
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,527
I don’t have to take
the hearing test.

283
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,529
I’m so proud of you, Lisa.

284
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,530
What?

285
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,657
You’re like Geraldine Ferraro,

286
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,451
except you won
where she failed miserably.

287
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,705
Well, I think I can say
with all humility,

288
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:49,792
I am going to be the
best school president ever.

289
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,337
(sarcastically):
Bravo, Lisa. Bravo.

290
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,964
Aw, wasn’t that sweet?

291
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,383
Even your brother’s
adding his kudos.

292
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,218
I was being sarcastic.

293
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,344
You were?

294
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,345
(heavy sarcasm): No.

295
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,763
I was being sincere.

296
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,557
Oh, I’m so confused.

297
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,559
Lis,
Skinner is using you,

298
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,019
like a pawn on his
unholy chess set.

299
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,231
On my chess set,
the pawns are all Hamburglars.

a perfect day to unveil
Operation SLAAAM:

313
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,486
So Long Athletics,
Art, And Music.

314
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,779
Care for a T-shirt?

315
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,363
T-shirt?

316
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,282
Why don’t you just
give me a sandwich board

317
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,408
that says "Male Prostitute"?

318
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,868
Oh, well... I...

319
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,787
Forgive me, sir.

320
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,830
(gasps)

321
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,874
They’ve taken everything!

322
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,167
Oh, no!

323
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,753
(sobbing)

324
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,547
Look what they’ve done
to my triangle!

325
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,674
I’m doing it!

326
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,428
I’m almost to the top!

327
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,097
Hello, self-esteem!

328
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,849
Repo man.

329
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,976
(grunts and groans)

330
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,977
Ha, ha!

331
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,313
I love this job.

332
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:38,359
"All extracurricular activities

334
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,695
(all gasp with horror)

335
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,948
Who would sign such an order?

336
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,200

339
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,708
And to think I was going
to ask you to the dance.

340
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,210
I would have gone with you.

341
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,379
Well, you still can.

342
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,922
Well, I don’t feel like it now.

00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,675

Lisa is a sellout!

358
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,465
Lisa,
what’s a sellout?

359
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,134
With the band gone,

360
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,303
how’ll I know
who to beat up?

361
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,639
Oh, they eliminated
"English for Fat Kids"!

362
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,308
Okay, you’ll do.

363
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,559
(both grunting)

364
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,061
Lis, you made
this school even worse.

365
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,730
And it wasn’t exactly
San Diego State

366
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,814
to begin with.

367
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,318
They made me pretty
and popular

368
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,696
just so they could exploit me
and ruin my good name.

369
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,574
Lisa, you’ve got to
stand up to these guys,

370
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,910
and when you do,
people will remember you.

371
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,370
Just look
at these postage stamps.

372
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,705
There’s Bugs Bunny,

373
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,957
Fat Elvis,
Autumn in New England,

374
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,251
Bats of the Southwest...
all heroes.

375
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,295
You want to see
Elvis kiss a bat?

376
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,422
(mimics Elvis): Hey, baby,
come here. I want to kiss you.

377
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:27,259
Squeak, squeak, squeak!
No, don’t kiss me!

378
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:31,305
You tricked me into betraying
my fellow students!

379
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,891
Lisa, student government
is meaningless.

380
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,434
Look at your constitution.

381
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,686
It’s written
on the back of a place mat.

382
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,854
And not a good place mat.

383
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,357
It’s from some place
called Doodles.

384
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,399
I see.

385
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,776
Principal Skinner, may I make

386
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,527
an announcement to the school?

387
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,322
I can’t see the harm.

388
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,491
I hereby resign
as your president,

389
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,867
<i>and for my last act,</i>

390
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,286
I call a general
student strike,

391
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,454
effective immediately!

392
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,414
Give me that!

393
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,375
And student caught striking
will be severely disciplined,

394
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,627
unless all of you do it,
then I’m stymied.

395
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,004
Strike! Strike! Strike!

396
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,756
Lisa, please,
help me lure them back.

397
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,966
I had to do what I did.

398
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,592
Our budget is
stretched tighter

399
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,969
than Mother’s sauna pants.

400
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,596
Seymour, quit using me
in analogies.

401
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,597
Yes, Mother.

402
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,848
Principal Skinner,

403
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,558
I will not call off this strike

404
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,811
until you bring back
Music and Art.

405
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:19,979
-What about Gym?
-Meh.

406
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,398
(chanting):
Hey, hey, Seymour S.,

407
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,400
nurture our well-roundedness.

408
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:28,696
Sneeze, puke, burp, fart,
we want Music, Gym and Art!

409
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,491
Why didn’t I cancel Sign-Making
and Creative Chanting?

410
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,659
Principal Skinner,

411
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,703
can’t you just reinstate
those programs?

412
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,121
Would you be willing

413
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,498
to pay an extra $1.23 in taxes
to fund them?

414
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,334
No way! I’m saving
for a speedboat.

415
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,585
Strike! Strike!

416
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,421
Lisa, what are you doing?

417
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,047
This is the kind of
trouble-making

418
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,424
I expect
from your brother.

419
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,675
You do?

420
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,302
Cool, a blank check for mayhem.

421
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,846
(grunts)

422
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,055
(groans)

423
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,518
Mom, I was elected
to make this a better school.

424
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,186
Well, couldn’t you
just hang

425
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,439
some colorful crepe paper
in the gym?

426
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,566
They’ve taken away
our crepe paper.

427
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,651
Those fuddruckers!

428
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,861
(siren whoops)

429
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,446
Oh-oh, they heard me.

430
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,865
Remember, boys,
these are little kids,

431
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,825
so take out your tiny batons.

432
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:15,826
(chuckles)

433
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,704
Chief Wiggam,

434
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,289
we’re just like you policeman.

435
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,582
Don’t you ever feel

436
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,459
like the mayor doesn’t care
about you?

437
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,419
You mean the mayor
who kept me waiting

438
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,962
for two hours
in that restaurant?

439
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,173
I ate so much bread!

440
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,299
Sit down, boys.

441
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,217
We’re joining this strike.

442
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,636
Uh, Chief, are you sure
the mayor wasn’t at

443
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,929
a different
Olive Garden than you?

444
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,848
Well, I can’t take
that rattlesnake

445
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,225
out of his mailbox now,
now, can I?

446
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,518
Yes, Chief, you could.

447
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,562
Well, let me ask you this:
Shut up.

448
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,231
The Springfield student strike
has entered its fourth day

449
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,441
with no end in sight.

450
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,110
Today, Professional Buttinski
Michael Moore arrived

451
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,320
on the scene.

452
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,363
Kids who don’t get
to take Music and Art

453
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,158
are 10% more likely to become
chronically unemployed

454
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,451
and appear
in one of my movies.

455
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,494
Where’d you get
that statistic?

456
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,287
Your mother.

457
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,831
The student strikers have been
joined by other unions,

458
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,416
including the
Springfield goat milkers,

459
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,253
The Association of Newsroom
Cue Card Holders-- Ow!--

460
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,964
<i>and the United Federation</i>
<i>of Theme Park Zombies.</i>

461
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,550
Zombie eat brains,

462
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:18,388
but zombie cannot swallow
this injustice.

463
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,807
The heart of the strike

464
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,767
is former Student Body President
Lisa Simpson.

465
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,852
Her brother had this to say:

466
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,605
Lisa is a nut,
she has a rubber butt,

467
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,775
every time she turns
around it goes "putt-putt."

468
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,361
Indeed, but that rubber butt
doesn’t have much time

469
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,320
for turning around these days.

470
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,155
It’s pointed squarely

471
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,782
in the face
of the administration.

472
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,993
Skinner! We have got
to get these kids

473
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,703
back in school.

474
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,622
Willie, can’t you turn
your hose on them?

475
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,499
They are wee children.

476
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,584
I’d sooner turn it on myself.

477
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,378
Well,
that’s a good idea, too.

478
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,297
See here, you nose-wiping
hair-combers.

479
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:56,009
Back in Edinburgh, we had
a coal miner’s strike.

480
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,888
All we wanted were hats
with a wee light on top.

481
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,307
Then one day
the mine collapsed.

482
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,476
No one made it out alive.

483
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,270
Not even Willie.

484
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,149
Skinner!

485
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,277
I don’t mean to interrupt
your advice from the janitor,

486
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,655
but I say cut off the head
and the body will die.

487
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,157
You want to get rid of Lisa?

488
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,491
But she’s such a good student.

489
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,743
Yes, in fact, I think

490
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,538
she’s a little too good
for this school.

491
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,082
If we stand together,
we are strong.

492
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,709
