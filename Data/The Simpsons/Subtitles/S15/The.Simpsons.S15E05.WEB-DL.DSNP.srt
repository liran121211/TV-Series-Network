I’m an intensive <i>care bear.</i>

199
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,995
Why does a bear
need a crowbar?

200
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:24,874
I don’t like

All right, that’s enough,
Fraidy Sue.

210
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,769
Here’s what
you got to do:

211
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,771
Find that bear
that whupped you,

212
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,022
and whup him back.

213
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,815
Can I fight
human-style?

214
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,984
By slowly poisoning
his environment

215
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,487
until he loses his fur
and becomes sterile?

216
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,822
You cowardly Swede.

217
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,783
You face that bear
like a man,

218
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,993
or I’ll never speak
to you again.

219
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,244
But how will I find out

220
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,413
what you had for lunch
in 1928?

221
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,415
I have a web site.

224
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,676
Mr. Simpson,
if you want to
find that bear

225
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,968
that attacked you,

226
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,512
use this.

227
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:23,182
It tracks an electronic tag
I stuck in the bear’s ear.

228
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,934
It’s the same technology

229
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,769
they use to keep tabs
on Gary Busey.

230
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,648
Finally, science has joined
forces with revenge.

231
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:34,527
Now, listen, the bull grizzly
is seven feet tall,

232
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,404
weighs more than
a Mazda Miata

233
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,988
and can tear
through a tree

234
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,241
like a Jewish mother
through self-esteem.

235
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,701
Next time you face him,

236
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,246
you better have some way
to protect yourself.

253

Homer, there’s no rear
on that thing.

254
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,920
I know. If I get really scared,
I don’t want to ruin the suit.

255
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,549
Now look here, Mister,
I forbid you to fight a bear.

256
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,384
What kind of example
would I be

257
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,303
if I didn’t take revenge
on things?

258
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,930
Dad, you can’t take
revenge on an animal.

259
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,599
That’s the whole point
of <i>Moby Dick.</i>

260
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,768
Lisa, the point
of <i>Moby Dick</i>

261
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,686
is "be yourself."

262
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,522
You’re not going,
and that’s final.

263
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,983

Fine.

264
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,320

00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,261

(chuckling)

274
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,307
Marge is sure going
to be steamed

275
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,768
-when she finds you missing.
-Or dead.

276
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:34,939
Gentlemen, sometimes a man
must put his marriage at risk

277
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,858
for reasons that are
confusing even to him.

278
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,111
You’re sneaking out
to fight that bear.

279
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,112
I want to go, too.

280
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,364
No way.

281
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,406
If something
happens to me,

282
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,408
you have to carry on
the Simpson name.

283

Screw that.
When I grow up,

284
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,912
I’m legally changing
my name to Joe Kickass.

285
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,497
That is so cool.

286
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,498
All right, you can come.

287
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,418
Lisa, I think
your father just left.

288
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,796
And Bart’s missing,
too.

289
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,923
I’ve got a bad feeling
about this.

290
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,967

That man
and his foolish pride.

296

follow him.

all my blood lust.

a bath in the river?

Yeah, it almost wrecked
the whole trip.

That’s... that’s funny.

358
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,906
(gunshot ricochets)

359
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,493
Oh, no.

360
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,329
The hunter has become
the hunter.

361
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,165
He must be
following <i>this </i>thing.

362
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,499
Well, I’m going to make sure

363
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,002
it never harms
another living creature.

364
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,795
(grunts)

365
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,380
(electronic zapping)

366
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,594
<i>NEWSMAN (over radio):</i>
A killer bear is on the loose

367
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,388
<i>in Springfield Forest,</i>
<i>and local laughingstock</i>
<i>Homer Simpson</i>

368
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,557
<i>is missing and presumed mauled.</i>

369
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,935
(chuckles):
Wrong again, liberal media.

370
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,105
<i>A bounty has been placed</i>
<i>on the rogue bear</i>

371
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,649
<i>in the amount of $10,000.</i>

372
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,943
Don’t worry,
I’ll find you someplace safe.

373
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,533
The bear’s no
longer wearing his
tracking device.

374
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,368
And it looks like
he’s headed toward that...

375
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,704
(mocking):
wildlife sanctuary.

376
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,790
Is there any sign
of my husband?

377
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:07,002
Hmm, your husband appears
to be traveling with the bear,

378
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,756
either as hostage
or as what we call
a "forest bride."

379
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,673
Ew!

380
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,887
Okay, you want to go
over there.

381
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,890
(neon sign buzzing)

382
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,017
Wait. Hold on.

383
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,644
Something
doesn’t feel right.

384
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,733
(groaning)

385
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,151
Wait. Stop.

386
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,028
I know bullets
can be scary sometimes,

387
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,155
but I have an idea.

388
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,408
First,
we pull off all your fur.

389
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,077
(loud roaring)

390
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,079
All right, all right,
I’m still thinking.

391
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:45,749
(gasps):
They’re looking
for a male bear, right?

392
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,334
(growls)

393
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,754
Oh. It’s so easy to condemn,
so hard to create.

394
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,924
Okay, boys, that bear’s going
to make a dash for freedom,

395
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:57,010
unless we take him down.

396
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,097
Yeah, all the way down.

397
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,642
What you said
didn’t really add much.

398
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:07,312
I know.
I just wanted to belong.

399
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:11,775
Well, we all feel that way
sometimes.

400
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,776
(all racking slides)

401
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,029
(metal clanking)

402
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,865
It’s Homer! Don’t shoot!

403
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,496
(quietly):
Go. Go.

404
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,789
It’s that bear!

405
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,542
Aim for the holes
in the colander!

406
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,425
He made it!

407
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,802
He’s finally
protected from man.

408
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,305
Yeah, but now he’s being
attacked by an elephant.

409
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:45,309
(trumpeting)

410
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:48,520
Well, I’m proud
of you, Homie.

411
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,023
You set out to
fight an animal,

412
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,400
and you ended up
saving its life.

413
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,320
What can I say?
I love nature.

414
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,241
Circle of life.

415
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,459
