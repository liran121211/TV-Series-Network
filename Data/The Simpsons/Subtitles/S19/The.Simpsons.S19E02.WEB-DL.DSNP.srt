taste that hot fudge,

79
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,249

93
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,362

94
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,197
-Donny.
-You’re Donny?

95
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,117
Pop-pop said that
after he died,

96
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,577
you should give me
ten bucks a week.

97
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,579
Starting now.

98
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,456

99
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,502

of town next week, so...

100
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,920

we’re leaving!

101
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,172

104
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,971
My brother twisted his ankle
setting up the chairs.

105

this family never cease?

respect for the dead.

114
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,825
(groaning):

115
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,870
It hurts, and not in a good way.

116
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,747

124
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,636
a dangerous quantity
of grave dirt.

125
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,473
Well, you’re always telling me
I should eat more dirt.

126
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,808
Not dirt. Vegetables!

127
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,977

You know, Homer,

244
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,841
there’s one thing about opera
that has always bugged me:

245
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,427
everyone sings
instead of talking.

246
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,638

where singing
is talking.

00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,852
Thanks!

Wait, Homer,
before you go,

254
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,489
there is a new note
I’ve been working on.

255
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,116

00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,212

more of this flavor...

(sings operatic note)

260
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,259

You know, it might be
a little more romantic

without your entourage.

268
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,069
But I need my childhood friends
to help me keep it real.

269
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,863
Would you have me keep it fake?

270

can’t we please be alone?

271
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,451
It’s our
anniversary.

272
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,453
We’ll move
to another table.

Isn’t it nicer,

276
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,209
Excuse us.

277
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,212

flirting with women.

00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,063

289
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,484

your performance.

00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,989

363
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:10,719
sing at your daughter’s
birthday,

364
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,221

-Dedicate your shopping center?

366
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,016
What’s the anchor store?

367
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,059
I don’t think so.

368
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,852
She’s perfect!

369
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,229
For the first time
since you became

370
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,232
an opera star
I can finally relax.

371
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,359
Well, uh, I’m not sure
she’s working out.

372
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,405

376
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,802
That’s it!

377
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,137
Let me make
something very clear:

378
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,888
my heart belongs
to Marge and you can

379
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,015
never, ever have it.

380
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,683
This opera’s over

381
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,477
when the fat <i>man </i>sings.

382
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,562
All right, Homer.

383
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,855
I understand perfectly.

384
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,356
You shall never be mine.

385
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,650
That’s good.
You’ve calmly accepted

386
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,653
that you will never have the
only man you could ever love.

387
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,613
Now, I think it would
be best if you left.

388
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,409
-Julia, wait!
-Yes?

389
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,994
Before you go,

390
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,996
could you hire your
own replacement?

391
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,750
But make sure
she’s not crazy like you.

392
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,334

Die, you stupid cobra!

395
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,675
Die! Die!

396
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,553
(giggling)

397
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,972
Dad, I think someone’s
trying to kill you.

398
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,098
Who could it be?

399
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,725
A disgruntled former employee?

400
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:43,145
Whoever it is, the cobra
is their symbol.

401
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,610

Chief, I think we should
cancel the performance.

408
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,255
No can do, Marge.

409
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,174
My first duty is to the
season-ticket holders.

410
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,926
But don’t worry,
I’ve got the entire

411

opera house on
a complete lockdown.

414
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,684
and to take out
the biggest threat of all,

415
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,645
we’re pre-crashing
the chandelier.

I’m so tense.

423
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,541
I can’t enjoy Count Almaviva

424
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,502
serenading the intended bride
of Dr. Bartalo.

425
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,711
I just can’t.

426
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,338
I don’t see anything suspicious.

427
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:55,384
Except someone is loudly
unwrapping their candy.

428
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:59,012
It ain’t candy, it’s a lamb chop
wrapped in foil.

429
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,223
Hey, Mom, do all
conductors carry

430
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,975
poisoned blow-darts
in their pocket?

431
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,228
Well, Arthur Fiedler used to,
but I’d better take a look.

433

Chief Wiggums!

The maestro is the killer!

435
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,822
All right, I’m going in.

436
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,785

Okay, that’s a wrap, people!

446
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,411
Luckily, the sniper bullets

447
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,163
stopped her heart
from pumping the poison

448
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,498
through her body long enough
for the chandelier

449
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,083
to squish it all out of her.

450
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,336
With any luck, she’ll be up
and stalking within a week.

451
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,463
(chuckles)

452
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,048
I’m sorry you got hurt,

453
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,217
but you learned
an important lesson.

454
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,969
One comes between
me and my Homie.

455
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,804

I’ll get you for this, Marge,

456
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,514
if it’s the last thing I do.

457
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,433
(normal voice):
Oh, and I scheduled
the cable guy

458
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,435
to come on Wednesday
between 10:00 and 2:00.

459
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,395
Oh, but Wednesday’s
not good for me.

460

463
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,784
or should I say,
Madame Butterface?

464
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:44,868
-What? What?
-I had two.

465
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,621
Well, that’s it.

466
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,790
I’m retiring from the opera.

467
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,625
It’s just too popular.

468
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,294
And I know something
much more fun

469
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,046
I can do on my back.

470
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,219
Singing opera made me
good at painting.

471
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,430
-Is that a real thing?
-No.
