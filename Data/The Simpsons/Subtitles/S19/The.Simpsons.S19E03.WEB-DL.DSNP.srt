Swedish speedballs,

166
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,503

they can do about it!

167
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,088

a tow truck.

176

179
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:49,283
Not to worry. <i>These...</i>

180

181
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,203
No problem.

182
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,500
Man, you work as a silhouette
model for one day

183
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,710
and it haunts you
for the rest of your life.

184
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,129
Now just remember two rules.

185
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,631
One, stick to Springfield.

186
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,800
If I catch you on my turf,
I’ll rip off your head,

187
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,343
vomit down your neck,
pull out your heart,

188
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,761
show it to your head,

189
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,346
then shove ’em both down
your neck hole,

190
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,390
to which I previously alluded.

191
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,142
"...which I previously
alluded..."

192
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,560
Are there two "L’s"
in "alluded"?

193
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,020
Rule number two, always keep
your hook pointed out.

194
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,897
Why? What happens
if I point it this way?

195
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,190
Oh hello-o!

196
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,609
-Hello!
-Hello, Captain Hook!

197
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,195
Oh, spoil sport.

198
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,363
Oh, you’re no fun.

199
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,074

00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,667
Ah, my first tow.

201
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,754
I think it goes... here.

202
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,886
D’oh!

203
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,141
Ah, my first tow.

204
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,605
Stop. Stop.

205
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,148
I’m entitled to park there.

206
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,317
Really?
What’s your handicap?

207
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,195
Pogonophobia--
fear of beards and mustaches.

-Wee!

360
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,486
Okay,
I’m warning you--

361
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,113
Wee!

362
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,032
I’ll kill you, you son of a--

363
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,867
Wee!

364
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,286
All right buddy, that’s it,
I’ve had--

365
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,287
Wee!

366
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,288
(thud)

367
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,041
Oh, wee...

368
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,505
(grunting):
You... let go!

369
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,132
(grunting)

370
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,384
All right,
Just... let... go.

371
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,181
Oh, a trap door.

372
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,182
What’s down there?

373
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,558
Your <i>Meatball</i>
collection?

374
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,101
-Goodbye.
-I thought
we were friends!

375
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,394
I was kidding you
in a friendly fashion!

376
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,479
(thump)

377
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,608
Who are you guys?

378
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,776
We’re just like you--

379
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,111
tow truck drivers
who got greedy.

380
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,405
Is Louie keeping you
prisoner here?

381
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,990
No. We’re waiting for him

382
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,159
to give us a timeshare
presentation.

383
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,994
Actually,
we’re an a cappella group

384
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,413
and we’re gonna sing
"Under the BoardWalk."

385
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,499
The truth is, we’re just waiting
for each others’ hair to grow

386
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,959
so we can braid it.

387
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,418
(all laugh)

388
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,628
Okay, I get it.

389
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:03,671
I’m not stupid.

390
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,797
It’s number two, right?

391
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,510

392
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:14,890

♪ Out of the sun! ♪

397
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,321
It sure is great not
having Homer around

398
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,156
to tell us where we can
or can’t park.

399
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,409
Yeah, without the crushing
rule of law,

400
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,828
society will do a better job
of regulating itself.

401
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,916
(both laugh)

402
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,836
(tires screeching)

403
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,379
Of all the nerve!

404
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,391
Now to buy some soft luggage.

405
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,478
(phone ringing)

406
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,646
Dad?

407
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,897
Where are you?

408
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:04,940
Do not worry.

409
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:05,941
I am working.

410
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,359
Working? Where?

411
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,986
Ask no questions.

412
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,404
And do not call
the police,

413
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,613
or I will kill me.

414
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,157
You sound weird.

415
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,825
All is well.
Goodbye forever.

416
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,452
-(dial tone)
-(sighs)

417
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,661
-(horns honking)
-(clamoring)

418
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,746
Get out of the way!

419
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,830
That’s my space.

420
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:20,914
I was here first.

421
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,253
Avast, ye sky whale!

422
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,887
(victorious laughter)

423
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,391
I need a camera battery!

424
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,775
-(train whistle blowing)
-(metal clanging)

425
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,110
All the Transformers
transformed

426
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,321
back into trucks and cars.

427
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,031
The end.

428
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,199
-Oh, that’s great.
-Great story.

429
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,742
Okay, we’ve got time
for one more.

430
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,327
Oh, yeah. All right.

431
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,787
Once upon a time,

432
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,790
there was a hilarious ogre
named <i>Shrek Three.</i>

433
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,792
He lived in medieval times,

434
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,711
but sometimes he’d say things
from today times...

435
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,297
Got one!

436
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,930
We can say these swears
any time we want

437
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,139
because they’re
in the <i>Bible!</i>

438
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,266
I don’t think "Leviticus"
is a swear.

439
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,601
Shut the hell up,
you damn ass whore.

440
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,644
MARGE:
Bart?

441
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,354
Uh-oh.

442
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,940
I’m starting to worry
about your father.

443
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,942
Well, I know he seems
to get dumber every year,

444
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,527
but lately he’s plateaued.

445
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,362
He hasn’t been home
in four days.

446
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,822
(grunts)

447
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,990
Well, I guess he told me
not to worry.

448
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,285
Where are you, Homie?

449
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,135
(yelps)

450
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,579
(cats meowing)

451
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,663
Yah!

452
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,623
Yah, yah, doggies!

453
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,791
Yah! Yah! Yah!

454
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,544
Go, go, go!

455
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,523
And if elected president
of our small community,

456
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,483
I will determine
once and for all

457
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,778
how far we can go
without being gay.

458
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,408
Maggie!

459
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,410
(door opens)

460
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,453
(door shuts)

461
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,009
We’re free!

462
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,762
Maggie!

463
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,347
You did all this?!

464
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,352
And to pay you back,
I’m returning your nose.

465
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,978
Here’s your nose.

466
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,147
-Daddy’s putting back
your nose.
-(giggling)

467
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,982
That’s your--
Oh, wait.

468
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:34,983
That’s Lisa’s nose.

469
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,778
Homie!

470
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,614
You’re all right!

471
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,366
Thanks to her!

472
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,160
Really?

473
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,745
Look at you...

474
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,538
so grown up.

475
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,290
Well, I’ve moved on, too.

476
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,970
Are you sure?

477
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,972
Hugs are dr...

478
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,017
Oh...
