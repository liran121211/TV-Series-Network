Wow, Bart!

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,529
Lookin’ good!
(chuckles)

13
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,490
Well, I have to look good
for tomorrow.

14
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,574
Right...

15
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,159
tomorrow.

16
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,578
Homer, you do know
what tomorrow is.

00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,581
<i>I’m not thinking. You think.</i>

19
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,374
You have to think,
it’s your job!

20
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,876
<i>(mocking):</i>
<i>You have to think,</i>

21
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,753
Why you little...

22
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,755
(grunting)

23
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,381
Homer!

24
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,966
Lisa is receiving

25
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,552
the Student of the Millennium
Award at school.

26
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,096
To be fair,

27
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,263
the millennium
just started,

28
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,182
so it’s not
that big a deal.

29
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,184
But they’re giving it to me.

30
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,602
(giggles)

31
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,104
You have
to be there.

32
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,855
You miss way too many
precious moments

33
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,649
in the childrens’ lives.

34
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,526
What?! Name 12.

35
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,860
Well,
just this week,

36
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,986
there’s been
field day,

37
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,279
picking me up
from the airport...

38
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,031
And the Father-
Daughter Dance.

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,077
Lisa, if you like,
I’m certified

40
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,037
to conduct a mock
father/daughter conversation.

41
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,831
Just dance.

42
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,542
Homer, you cannot miss
Lisa’s big day.

43
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,085
And you have
to come sober!

44
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,962
American sober or Irish sober?

45
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,505
Point zero eight sober.

46
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,923
Point one five.

47
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,174
Point zero nine.

48
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,593
Point one zero with a stomach
full of bread.

49
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,761
My final offer.

50
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,138
(grunts) Deal.

51
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,102
Goodnight, sweetheart.

52
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,773
-(ringing)
-(moans)

53
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,401
Can’t be late
for Lisa’s big day.

54
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,043
(hums)

55
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,297
I’m gonna make it.

56
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,965
I’ll be on time
for Lisa’s thing.

57
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,759
Ooh, an awesome accident.

58
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,344
Easy, easy...

59
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,763
I’ll just take three seconds
to gawk.

60
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,807
Aw, everyone’s okay.

61
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,517
(tires squealing)

62
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,102
Gonna make it.
Gonna make it.

63
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,812
Whoo-hoo!

64
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,148
(grunts)

65
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:14,652
An hour and 54 minutes to spare.

66
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:18,031
With my free time I can finally
work on my <i>Superman </i>novel.

67
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,241
"’Make way for Superman,’

68
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,953
said Superman as he punched
everyone at the Coffee Bean.

69
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,121
Chapter Two..."

70
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,293
Oh, man,

71
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,170
they just keep kicking off
awards season

72
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,796
earlier and earlier.

73
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,757
Yeah, the whole thing
is just a scam

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,635
to sell ad space
in the school paper.

75
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,346
JIMBO: That’s the place
that did both my Grandmas.

76
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,348
DOLPH: I did
both your grandmas.

77
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,849
Shut up!

78
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,267
KEARNEY: Shall we look
at the next one?

79
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,477
Willie.

80
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,686
He’ll buy beer for you,

81
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,355
but he’ll make you
drink it with him.

82
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,940
(boys chuckling)

83
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,276
(meowing)

84
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,948
<i>Darn these long bank lines.</i>

85
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,700
<i>Although it does give me</i>
<i>a moment with my thoughts.</i>

86
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,202
Ooh...

87
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,288
(grunts)
<i>Darn these long bank lines.</i>

88
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,208
(frustrated grunting)

89
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,378
(continues grunting)

90
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,213
That old man over there

91
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,257
isn’t even making
a transaction.

92
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,675
He just wants
someone to talk to.

93
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,427
Before this was
the Bank of Springfield,

94
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,596
this was the Midwest
Savings and Loan.

95
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,724
And before that,
it was an abandoned theater.

96
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,310
And before that,
it was a theater.

97
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,604
Where’s Dr. Kevorkian
when you need him?

98
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,607
Well, if I know doctors,
he’s probably golfing.

99
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,567
(both chuckle)

100
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,403
Excuse me
for a moment.

101
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,030
Everyone down
on the floor, now!

102
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,031
(gunshot, glass breaks)

103
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,574
(grunting)

104
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,118
This is a robbery!

105
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,869
Uh, not a separate
robbery--

106
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,079
we’re together.

107
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,622
You mean
like a couple?

108
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,207
-No!
-Yes!

109
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,583
Oh, great.

110
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,795
We’re being robbed
by <i>Johnny </i>and Clyde!

111
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,298
(patrons laughing)

112
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,216
(cries out)

113
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,218
Stay away
from that button!

114
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,428
(alarm ringing)

115
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,429
Damn it!

116
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,932
(Skinner clearing throat)

117
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,600
Hm...

118
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:13,771
Well, Marge,
who’s the unfit parent now?

119
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,189
(chuckles)

120
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,941
You know, a principal’s dream

121
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,570
would be to have a school
with nothing but Lisa Simpsons.

122
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,989
Unfortunately,
the rest of you exist.

123
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,741
From her grade-grubbing
to her apple polishing...

124
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,785
(phone ringing)

125
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,664
ROBBER:
She’s got a cell phone!

126
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,749
We didn’t plan for this, man.

127
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,835
We didn’t plan for this.

128
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,629
Ol’ Gil’s here for his first day
as security guard.

129
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,340
Oh, boy...
(gunshots)

130
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,301
(screaming, glass breaking)

131
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,219
Oh, no.
Now it’s murder, man.

132
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,220
It’s murder.

133
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,514
(screams)

134
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,308
Uh, Chief,

135
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,393
looks like we got
a 64-G in progress.

136
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,230
Armed robbery with a gun.

137
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,318
(groans)

138
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,237
Come on, Chief, you know this.

139
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,573
Oh, a shooty-stealy.

140
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,871
And now the reason
we’re all here today...

141
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,414
Lisa Simpson!

142
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:17,418
(cell phone playing)

143
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,963
Oh, hello, Marge.

144
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,549
I’m at the most important event
of our daughter’s life,

145
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,593
and you’re totally late.

146
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,553
Am I disappointed? Yes.

147
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,555
Am I surprised? No.

148
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,598
(whispering):
Homer.

149
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,518
I’m a hostage
in a bank robbery.

150
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,187
What?! Oh, my God,
my sweet Margie!

151
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,189
<i>Okay, listen very carefully.</i>

152
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,191
Don’t do anything they say,

153
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,902
remain panicky, and above all,
try to be a hero.

154
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,445
Homer, I have to go.

155
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,073
If I don’t make it,
feel free to remarry--

156
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,909
from anyone on the list in the
bulletin board in the closet.

157
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,455
(sobbing)

158
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,457
Goodbye, my love!

159
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,047
Okay, this isn’t the way
I planned it,

160
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,424
but you can make it
out alive

161
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,758
as long as there’s
no funny stuff.

162
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,051
Don’t worry about me.

163
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,846
I was voted America’s
least funny clown.

164
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,598
Worse than Scuzzo, Scummo,
Oopsie, Carlos Mencia,

165
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,058
Stinko, Blumpy.

166
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,893
Even worse Sergeant Serious!

167
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,186
How could I do worse than him?!

168
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,855
I stole all his jokes!

169
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,400
(Homer panting)

170
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,068
Chief, you gotta
do something--

171
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,070
my current wife
is in there!

172
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,530
Maybe you should
take over,

173
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,865
’cause I got no
stake in this.

174
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,199
This isn’t even my bank.

175
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,951
I’m over at First Federal.

176
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,327
(moans)

177
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,499
-(explosion)
-Oh! Dye pack!

178
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,543
Man, that stings.

179
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,378
-(explosion)
-Oh. Damn it!

180
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,213
What are you looking at, huh?

181
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,048
(explosion, screams)

182
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,885
Oh! Is anyone else a dye pack?

183
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,095
Tell me now,
and I won’t shoot you.

184
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,097
I... Ooh!

185
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,974
You said diabetic, right?

186
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,434
(sighs)

187
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,440
Finally, the help we need--
a DVD of <i>The Negotiator.</i>

188
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,902
Hmm, hmm.

189
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,695
Which chapter
should we skip to?

190
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,156
"Meet Danny Roman,"
"Trouble Brewing,"

191
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,450
"Off the Case,"
"My Baby’s in There,"

192
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,785
"Enter Niebaum,"
"Take the Shot,"

193
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,663
"Sabian’s Choice,"
"Check and Mate,"

194
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,541

"Closing Credits"?

195
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,210
Oh, man, oh, man.

196
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,128
What the hell’s
taking them so long?

197
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,379
They must be getting ready
to kill me!

198
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,714
It’s no fair.

199
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,049
I shouldn’t die.

200
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,092
I just came here
to check the date!

201
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,887

202
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,180
(clears throat)

203
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,766
Dwight, use your noodle.

204
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,559
If you surrender now,

205
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,811
you’re only looking at
a few years in jail.

206
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,688
I’ll tell them
you’re a good guy.

207
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,941
Marge, I can’t
go back to prison.

208
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,318
I’ve got no wife,
I’ve got no family.

209
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,320
I’ve got nothing!

210
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,366
(guns cocking)

211
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,619
If I give myself up,

212
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,371
will you come visit me
in the joint?

213
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:06,837
Hey, if I can say yes
to Chinese toys that kill kids,

214
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,131
you can say yes to him.

215
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,717
Okay, I’ll visit you, Dwight.

216
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,686
(Marge groans)

217
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,022
Oh, Marge, I was afraid
I was going to lose you!

218
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,232
(sobs)

219
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,900
Now let me help you

220
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,653
make your slow transition
back to society.

221
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,155
I just want
to go home.

222
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,117
You have a new home
now with us.

223
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,285
(Marge groans)

224
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,579
See ya soon, Marge.
Real soon!

225
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,955
Just like you promised!

226
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,790
(maniacal laughter)

227
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,710
(chuckles nervously)
Hmm.

228
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,595
Sweetheart,
what’s wrong?

229
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,430
I promised
that bank robber

230
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,056
that I’d visit him
in jail,

231
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,641
but I just
can’t do it.

232
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:01,934
You don’t owe him anything.

233
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,853
Moe was in the hospital
for three weeks,

234
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,438
and I didn’t visit him once.

235
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,648
You said you visited him
every night.

236
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,109
Moe the tavern,
not Moe the person.

237
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,570
Well, promises
mean more to me.

238
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,074
Okay, you gave your word.

239
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,452
You’re going to visit him,
no excuses.

240
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:23,497
Ooh! Shlomo’s Judaica
is having a blowout on dreidels.

241
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,499

242
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,211
All right, this time I’m going.

243
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,048
I’m really going
to visit a bank robber.

244
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,175
A man who held a gun on me.

245
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,093
Going to see him in prison,

246
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,930
where guards will frisk me,
paw through my purse, and...

247
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,683
Ooh, there’s apple picking
just up the road!

248
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,689
I’m getting
a visitor today.

249
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,399
I’m so nervous
it feels like

250
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,026
I keistered
a bunch of butterflies.

251
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,153
Dude, I highly doubt
you’re getting a visitor.

252
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,446
People don’t like you.

253
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,448
You come off needy and bug-eyed.

254
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,658
You’re wrong.

255
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,743
Marge is coming. She is.

256
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,662
Easy, bro. It’s not like
she’s your mother.

257
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,121
I wish she was.

258
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,666
My real mother abandoned me
in an amusement park.

259
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,959
All I have left is a caricature
from that day.

260
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,379
Ooh. That is harsh.

261
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,676
Hey, baby.

262
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,802
Listen carefully.

263
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,721
Someone’s been editing
my biography on Wikipedia.

264
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:21,639
I want you to kill him.

265
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,973
No problem, sweetie.

266
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,102
I’ll dump his body in the same
lake as your lousy lawyer.

267
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,688
(gasps): Then when you get out,
we can have a picnic there!

268
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,649
Aw, that’s so sweet.

269
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,736
Anyone for me?

270
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:43,327
I really shouldn’t show up
without an apple pie for Dwight.

271
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,247
In fact, I really shouldn’t
show up without an apple pie

272
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,249

273
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,875
Oh, my, it’s 5:00.

274
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,711

275
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,509

277

burned-out lightbulbs.

279
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,350
thought we should
throw these away.

280
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,394
Mom, I think there’s something
you’re trying to avoid.

281
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,937

(music stops)
Oh, hey, oh.

368
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,438
Oh, wait, this ain’t
where I go to vote.

369
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,023
(chuckles nervously)

370
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,363
Hello, Marge.

371
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,033
(groans)

372
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,367
Man, these cars
look all alike.

373
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,413
Now drive!

374
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,250
Dwight!

375
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,626
(chuckles nervously)

376
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,920
I-I was just on my way
to see you in prison.

377
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,630
Really, Marge?

378
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,425
-Look me in the eyes
and say that.
-Okay.

379
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,180
They’re so buggy, I can’t.

380
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,935
Dwight, please,
don’t do anything crazy.

381
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,896
-Just pull over there.
-Huh?

382
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,693
Um, what are we
doing here?

383
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,362
This is where my mom
abandoned me.

384
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,907
Oh, that’s so sad.

385
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,991
Ya think?

386
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,664
Marge, can you please give me
the day my mother didn’t?

387
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,750
Ride some rides,
eat some cotton candy.

388
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,043
Then I’ll let you go home.

389
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,504
Okay, but I’d feel
better about it

390
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,297
if you got rid
of the gun.

391
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,382
I’d like to, but then
you’ll leave like she did.

392
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,676
Can you at least
put it in your jacket?

393
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,262
Fine, but I’m still gonna
make that pointy shape.

394
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,434
Krusty.

395
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,020
I haven’t see you since
that terrifying day.

396
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,565
Uh, you’ll have to be
<i>way </i>more specific.

397
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,900
We were hostages
at the bank.

398
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,819
Oh, yeah.

399
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,737
Sorry I offered your
life for my safety.

400
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,531
(laughs)

401
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,032
Look, it’s Marge!

402
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,575
With Dwight!

403
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,702
I said there was
a spark between them,

404
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,788
and you said, "No way."

405
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:46,041
I saw it, I just didn’t
feel like talking to you.

406
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,377
Wait, something’s
screwy here.

407
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,878
I’m calling the cops.

408
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,214
Don’t bother, they’re
right over there.

409
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,383
Easy, easy.

410
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,969
Line up your shot,
then squeeze it off.

411
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,137
(gunshot)

412
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,266
Uh, Chief, I think we got a
hostage situation over there.

413
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,185
Can’t a man spend one minute
with his stuffed monkey?

414
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,687
One minute?

415
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,063
(to self): Monkey would make
a better chief.

416
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,481
What did you say?

417
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,859
I said the monkey would
make a better chief!

418
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,152
He’s a good monkey,
all right.

419
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,570
Hm...

420
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,657
(gasping)

421
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,617
The Viking boats!

422
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,911
This is where I lost
my first mom.

423
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,163
MARGE: Oh...

424
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,124
Well, this mom is not
gonna say bug-eye.

425
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,418
I mean, goodbye.

426
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,837
Damn it!

427
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:40,762
Boy, I really feel like
a Viking in this thing.

428
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,348
I’ll show them which monkey
would make the best chief!

429
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,350
(Wiggum grunts)

430
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,102
(screams)

431
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,520
Stop the boats!

432
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,771
(snapping)

433
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,898
(Spanish accent):
Sorry, Mister.

434
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,316
(Wiggum groans)

435
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,775
Are you kidding me?!

436
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,818
Ow!

437
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,321
Dwight, do something!

438
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,198
Okay. For you, Ma.

439
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,450
(Wiggum yelling)

440
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,160
-(cracking)
-WIGGUM: Great.

441
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,203
Dwight?

442
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,788
Are you okay? Dwight!

443
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,499
He’ll be fine.

444
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,418
Not you and me fine,
but fine.

445
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,629
Hey, leave
the comedy to me.

446
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,839
Okay, funny man,
make me laugh.

447
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,842
Huh. Uh-uh.

448
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:22,221
Instead of a carnival ride,
what if he was run over

449
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,431
by a Zamboni
with a moustache?

450
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,266
-I don’t see how.
-Then I got nothing.

451
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:32,231
Dwight, that was the most
unselfish thing I’ve ever seen.

452
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,441
I’m sorry I didn’t
visit you before.

453
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,859
HOMER: Hey, Marge.

454
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,569
Look at us,
the four amigos.

455
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,781
They’re gonna let me do some odd
jobs for them on the outside.

456
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,199
Listen, outside my cell,

457
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,617
I saw one dandelion growing.

458
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,785
I picked it for you.

459
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:45,994
Aw!

460
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,579
Then I pressed it
in my Bible to dry.

461
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,122
Oh!

462
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,291
I carved a frame for it
out of a bar of soap.

463
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,585
-Aw!
-Read the inscription
on the back.

464
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,712
"You chat up the guard
at the gate,

465
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,423
while I knife the guard
behind me."

466
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,967
I can’t do that, Dwight.

467
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,843
I figured
you’d say that.

468
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,470
But you can
keep it though.

469
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,515
Aw, thank you.
