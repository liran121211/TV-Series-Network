may blow your cover.

Your car, she’s a-coming
off the assembly line.

91

the ultimate marriage

92

94

straight to Rome,

95

where it’ll be shipped
to Mr. Burns in Springfield.

96
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:08,998
Gee, I wish
we could explore

97
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,833
a little
more of Italy.

98
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,754

to be irresponsible?

107
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,871

to turn around

108
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,498
and see the tower?

109
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,458
Eh, there’s a picture of it
on my cup.

110
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,963
When Mount Vesuvius
erupted,

111
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,674
people were overcome
by volcanic ash so fast

112
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:00,675
that they were frozen

113
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,260

they were in

114
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,344

of their death.

120

It says here we should turn left

121
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,442
at a fat chick in a tutu
being fed by a midget.

122
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,569
That’s a DVD
of a Fellini movie.

123
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:25,366

The midget represents dwarves.

181
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,050
Damn it!

182
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:48,968
Never!

183
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,014
Now cut that out.

184
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,393
Ah, Tuscany.

185
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,897
Fortune is finally
smiling upon me.

186
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,982
(mutters angrily)

187
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,906
<i>I left my past behind</i>

188
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,074
<i>and moved to the small village</i>
<i>of Salsiccia.</i>

189
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,660
<i>Acceptance came slowly.</i>

190
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,747
It’s pronounced <i>"buon giorno."</i>

191
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,707
Your mouth is getting lazy
on the second syllable.

192
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,876
Here, let me guide you.

193
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,589
<i>But that all changed</i>
<i>when the grape harvest began.</i>

194
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,174
(people groaning)

195
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,852
(all gasp)

196
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,940
♪ These feet are made

197
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,942

Ready, feet?

201
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,449
Start stomping.

202
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,701
(hums lively tune)

203
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,203
(cheers)

204
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,831
<i>It was the biggest</i>
<i>harvest ever.</i>

205
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,960
<i>Never had I felt</i>

207
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,552
<i>But I won more than</i>
<i>the love of a town.</i>

208
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,553
WOMAN:
Roberto...

209
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,845
Amore.

210
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,849
This is my bride Francesca
and my son Gino.

211
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,810
Holy moley!

212
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,313
I always thought you were,
you know, out loud and proud.

213
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,024
Well, I experimented
in college, as one does.

214
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,818
Yeah.
I never went to college.

215
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,194
Stop the presses.

216
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,780
Hello, I’m Marge.

217
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,492
This is my husband Homer,
my daughters Lisa and Maggie,

218
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,244
and my son Bart Simpson.

219
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,496
Bart Simpson?

220
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,957
The name Roberto cries
when he has the bad dream.

221
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,544
Bart Simpson! Bart Simpson!
Bart Simpson!

222
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,129
I make like my daddy!

223
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,380
(stabbing noises)

224
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,756
(chuckles)
Yes.

225
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,761
Bart and I used
to go fly-fishing together.

226
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,848
Die, Bart! Die, Bart!

227
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,475
(groans)

228
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,604
You shall all stay for dinner

229
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,815
and tell me more
about my wonderful Roberto.

230
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,442
(sighs)

231
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:14,238
He makes love like a man
who just got out of jail.

232
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,239
(chuckles)

233
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,240
Yes, yes.

234
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,575
You crave my skillful touch.

235
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,493
Now go, take the boy,
and shut the door.

236
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,953
I’ll rock your world anon.

237
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,539
Simpsons, I beg of you.

238
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,750
Please don’t destroy
the new life I’ve created here.

239
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,127
Surely, even the most
heinous criminal

240
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,087
deserves a seventh chance.

241
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,506
Bob, you haven’t told your wife

242
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,924
about all the terrible things
you’ve done?

243
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,052
Yeah, I tell Marge everything.

244
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,305
Not necessarily in words,
but in body language.

245
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,931
You know, sneaking around
and such.

246
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,100
Bob, your family
will find out the truth.

247
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,186
Sooner or later,
you’ll try to kill me again.

248
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,437
Watch, I’ll prove it.

249
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,607
Come on, Bob, slice,
dice and serve on rice.

250
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,984
You little scamp.

251
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,527
(laughs)

252
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,113
You know, you’ll make some
murderer very happy one day,

253
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,824
but it shan’t be me.

254
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,077
Bart, Bob is
a family man now.

255
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,163
You can’t be a bad person
if you have a family.

256
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,083
And literature is filled
with tales of redemption

257
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,711
from Jean Valjean to the voice
of Buzz Lightyear, Tim Allen.

258
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,464
All right, Bob, we won’t tell
your beautiful new family

259
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,007
that you’re a homicidal
psychopath

260
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,759
if you fix up our car.

261
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,386
<i>Grazie.</i>

262
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,637
Now I can’t undo the past,

263
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,639
but I can try
to make it up to you.

264
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,642
My humble little town
is at your service.

265
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,062
<i>Loro sono miei amici,</i>

266
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,230
<i>le Simpsons!</i>

267
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,356
(cheering)

268
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,195
Dad, don’t act
like Mussolini.

269
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,323
Ooh, I thought I was
doing Donald Trump.

270
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,828
Here’s a cute fact.

271
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,621
This sausage shop
has been grinding

272
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,999
the same family of pigs
for 600 years.

273
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,674
<i>Prego?</i>

274
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,758
<i>Si, si.</i>

275
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,178
(muffled noises)

276
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,684
And he kisses you
with that mouth.

277
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,394
I love you, Marge.

278
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,062
(kissing noises)

279
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,064
(Sideshow Bob laughing
and speaking Italian)

280
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,364
(kids laugh)

281
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,575
He is so wonderful.

282
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,660
They must miss him
in America.

283
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,454
Uh, well...

284
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,081
Eat justice, Sideshow Bob!

285
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,422
Chief, I tried to warn you.

286
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,758
Sideshow Bob hasn’t
lived here for months.

287
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,301
Oh, God, am I sorry.

288
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,469
(chuckles)

289
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,137
Oh, hey, is that
a Penn State banner?

290
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,764
’Cause my cousin went there.

291
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:45,723
Did you know him?

292
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,349
Mark Wiggum, fat kid,

293
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,769
played a lot of Tetris.

294
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,271
(tapping on glass)

295
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,608
<i>Mi amici, </i>we are here to honor
my old friends, the Simpsons.

296
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,985
Tomorrow, they return
to America,

297
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,779
taking with them my gratitude,

298
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,865
my friendship
and my heartfelt wish

299
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,825
that they never return.

300
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,327
And now... <i>mangiata!</i>

301
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,706
No wine for her.

302
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,374
She’s only eight.

303
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,627
Marge, don’t be
so Olive Garden.

304
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,712
Yeah, this is Italy.

305
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,714
Look, the town drunk
is two years old.

306
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,466
♪ <i>Hey, mambo </i>♪

307
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,426

(Italian music plays)

310
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,525
Bob, your
generosity and...

311
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:41,028
abbondanza have
touched our hearts.

312
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,280
(cheering and applause)

313
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,824
Bra-Bravo!

314
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,118
Bravissimo!

315
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,578
Whoopsie.

316
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,039
I’ll just get it out
with more wine.

317
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,624
See? It’s fine.

318
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,042
Go on, go on with the thing.

319
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,669
(groans)

320
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,963
It’s obvious
why Bob is a vaunted pillar

321
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,172
of your community.

322
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,299
Yeah, but he’s a wanted killer

323
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,968
in <i>our </i>community.

324
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,595
(laughs)

325
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,806
(squeaks)

326
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,184
He deserves to be hailed
at this wingding.

327
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,770
More like jailed
at Sing Sing.

328
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,188
Time for bed, now.

329
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,439
-(laughs)
-(groaning)

330
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,276
Drunken children
tell the ugliest lies.

331
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,819

332
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,071

333
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,448

334
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,659

335
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,327
(all gasping)

336
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,745
(screams):
Sideshow Bob!

337
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,997
Sideshow Bob?

338
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,540
Il fuggitivo?

339
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,292
BOTH: Hmm?

340
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,682
Roberto.

341
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,726
Is this true? You try
to make the murder?

342
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,478
But darling, the boy
drove me to murder

343
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,480
by exonerating
a harlequin

344
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,816
who I framed for robbery
at the Kwik-E-Mart.

345
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,111
Oh, it all sounds so stupid.

346
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,739
You have brought shame

347
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:10,034
upon our humble,
Mafia-controlled village.

348
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,703
You are welcome in
Salsiccia no more.

349
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,954
(grunts)

350
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,289
(bleating)

351
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,291
(sinister grumbling)

352
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,376
Uh-oh. He’s getting
that stabby look.

353
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,713
Simpson family,

354
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:26,258
I hereby swear a...

355
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,219
(Italian accent):
vendetta.

356
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,765
"Vendetta" means...
"vendetta"!

357
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,849
(all scream)

358
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,312
Boy, that Sideshow Bob
goes from zero

359
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,356
to murder awfully fast.

360
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,025
At least this time it was Lisa
who ruined Bob’s life.

361
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,110
Oh, I feel so sick.

362
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,445

363
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,364

a hangover, sweetie.

364
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,532
And it’s an unavoidable
part of life.

experiencing

369
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,084

370
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,294

373
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,469
(tires screeching,
engine revving)

374
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,764
Oh, Dad, you’re driving
on an ancient Roman aqueduct.

375
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,808
What am I <i>supposed</i>
to use it for--

376
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,310

00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,993
Hmm?

384
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,911

389
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,676
Roberto!

390
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,429
Francesca,
you’ve come to me.

391
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,597
Well, you caught me
at the right time

392
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,391
because I swear never

393
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,184
in vengeance again.

394
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,561
No, Roberto.

395
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,521
If the Simpsons
have dishonored you,

396
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,941
they have dishonored our family,
and we shall take revenge

397
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:06,817
as a family.

398
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,986
Vendetta! Vendetta!

399
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,821
Vendetta for mi papa!

400
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,114

402
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,994
Ah, revenge is a dish

00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,507
(sinister laugh)

408
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,093
We’re in a foreign city

409
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,430
with no car,
being stalked by a killer.

410
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,348
I feel like
I’m the <i>Bourne Identity.</i>

411
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,643
(tires squeaking)

412
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,395
Hey, Krusty’s
in an opera here in Rome.

413
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,688
He can save our lives.

414
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,773
Come on. Let’s go.

415
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,358
Oh! Opera?

416
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,902
They have that here, too?

417
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,153
Ugh!

418
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,822
Let’s see. Uh...

419
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,449
Oh, I ain’t doin’ that.

420
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,825
Oh, that’s not funny.

421
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,286
Here we’ll change
"wealthy merchant"

422
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,830
to "nudist with big rack."

423
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,040
This needs punching up.

424
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:03,999
That’s comin’ out.

425
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,292
Two acts?!

426
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,710
Krusty, you gotta help us.

427
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,961
I don’t do gotta.

428
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,923
Sideshow Bob has sworn
a vendetta against us.

429
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,967
Vendetta? What’s that,
an Italian vending machine?

430
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,763
(screams)

431
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,348
That’s my opening joke.

432
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,724
And my closer.

433
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,768
And my saver.
And my topper.

434
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,186
(cries)

435
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,521
Please help us, Krusty.

436
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,522
We don’t want to be
the first Christians

437
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,148
to die at the
Colosseum.

438
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,566
I’ll tell ya what.

439
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,527
Put on these costumes,
go on the stage

440
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,028
and mix in
with the crowd scenes.

441
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,239
He won’t kill ya in front
of all those witnesses.

442
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,990
Can I be the Phantom
of the Opera?

443
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,784
Dad, the Phantom isn’t in this.

444
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,994
But I do a great impression
of him.

445
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,456
Um, I am the gayest
super villain ever.

446
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,834
Beware my
scented candles.

447
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,919
Ooh, scented.
