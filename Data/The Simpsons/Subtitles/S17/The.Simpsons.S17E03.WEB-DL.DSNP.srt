(loud scratching)

12
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,376
Maggie, that’s not
what you do with a hymnal.

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,878
Homer!

14
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,796
What? I forgot to floss
this morning.

15
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,717
Something’s wrong
with Maggie.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,302
We should get her
to Dr. Hibbert.

17
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,179
But I don’t see him anywhere.

18
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:59,476
The Hibberts now attend a more
"boisterous" house of worship.

Uh, I hate to interrupt
while you’re rejoicing,

32
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,544

is terribly itchy.

Mm-hmm!

34
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,091

the initial stages
of chicken pox.

Coat Maggie with this

and the scabbing will heal.

39
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,723
The scabbing will heal!

00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,683
ALL: The scabbing
will heal!

41
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,602
Heal my scabs, Lord!

42
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,062
Praise the Lord!

43
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,688
I can walk again!

00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,524
Hmm...

45
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,651
What? My foot fell asleep.

46
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,028
Sweetie,
I know it itches,

47
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,948
but you’ve got
to stop scratching.

48
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,616
No!

49
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,576
(gasps): No!

50
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,662
Here, here, play
with your teddy bear.

51
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,750
Oh, sugar-booger!

52
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,877
Aw, poor Maggie.

53
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,962
Homer, don’t touch her!

54
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,005
You’ve never had chicken pox.

55
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,758
I know, and you did,
and you’re great.

56
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,927
Oh, I’m just saying
it’s very dangerous

57
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,804
if you get it
as an adult.

58
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,514
It could leave
you sterile...

59
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,099
down there.

60
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,726
Oh, you always got to work blue,
don’t ya, Marge?

61
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,063
You’re better than that.

62
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,108
Can’t even go in
my own kitchen...

63
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,484
I bet Bart’s in there
right now

64
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,778
licking frosting off
my eggbeaters.

65
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,029
Mm.

66
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,072
Don’t worry, Dad.

67
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,448
I’m saving one for you.

68
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,076
I’ll just leave it here
in the dog’s mouth.

69
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,786
No! (stammers)
Bart!

70
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,872
That’s a really
bad storage area.

71
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,957
Hey Homer,
why the sour puss?

72
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,709
Did ya chugalug
a skunky Snapple?

73
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,502
I don’t know, maybe.

74
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,087
Plus my wife
won’t let me inside

75
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,006
because the baby’s
got chicken pox.

76
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,300
Really? Do you mind
if I bring my boys over

77
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,010
so she can infect
Rod and Todd?

78
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,887
Then there’ll be a pox
on both our houses.

79
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,263
Why would you do that?

80
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,264
Are you a bad parent?

81
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,849
<i>Au contraire,</i>
man with no hair.

82
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,143
You see, Rod and Todd
can only get
the chicken pox once,

83
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,811
and childhood’s
the safest time.

84
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,063
So you want Maggie
to infect your kids?

85
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,148
You betcha.

86
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,318
In fact, some parents have been
known to hold "pox parties,"

87
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,402
so other kids
in the neighborhood

88
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,654
can get the disease
when they please.

89
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,740
And would they pay handsomely
for the privilege?

90
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:19,949
Well, they might.

91
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,659
But you’d have to be awfully
money-grubbing

92
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,578
to charge your friends
and neighbors...

93
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,580
HOMER: $15 to infect
your kids.

94
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,040
Now featuring the Pox Box.

95
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,209
Pox Box not recommended
for pregnant or nursing women.

96
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,793
As with any disease box,
results may vary.

97
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,086
Pox Box.

98
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,756
Welcome to our pox party.

99
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,258
Save room for punch--
Maggie’s bathing in the bowl.

100
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,095
(doorbell ringing)

101
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,890
Uh, hi.

102
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,184
Luann will pick up Milhouse
when the party’s over.

103
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,727
I’ll just read in the car
till then.

104
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,021
(chuckles)

105
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:53,274
Oh, Kirk, come join
the parents in the kitchen.

106
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,235
We’re having
alcohol drinks,

107
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,237
and dishing on the parents
who aren’t here.

108
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,073
Ordinarily,
I’m not one to laugh
at a man’s urinary blockage,

109
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,824
but, you should
have seen it...

110
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,825
Oh, there he is.

111
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,119
(chuckles)

112
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:09,040
Ladies and gentlemen,
presenting the sister
with the blisters...

113
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,208
the tot with all the spots...

114
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,751
Maggie!

115
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,631
(coughing)

116
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,345
I feel like
a chicken already.

117
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,223
I just made an egg
in my pants.

118
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,769
Hey, Marge.

119
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,188
Hit me with a little bit
more of that, uh, silly slush.

120
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,815
Chief, don’t you think
you’ve had enough?

121
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,358
I’m fine.

122
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,901
Watch, I can even touch
my gun to my nose.

123
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,069
(both gasping)

124
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,405
Oh, don’t worry,
I’m the Pief of Cholice.

125
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,157
I mean, I’m, uh,
the beef with no cheese.

126
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,867
(sobbing):
Why doesn’t Lou like me?

127
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,703
Why?

128
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,288
Knock, knock.

129
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,248
Luann, what are you
doing here?

130
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,083
I thought you were just
dropping Milhouse off.

131
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,710
I could get some coffee
and come back...

132
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,836
No, no, no, you stay.

133
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,421
I’ll just drive home.

134
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,172
Uh, who’s going
to let me siphon?

135
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,049
Look, why don’t you
both stay

136
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,843
and have one of
my Marge-aritas?

137
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,636
All right!

138
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,597
I never drank one of these
without a cigarette in it.

139
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,434
Now, kids,
in lieu of one of those
inflatable jumping things,

140
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,729
please welcome
Mr. Krusty the Clown.

141
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,855
(cheering)

142
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,481
Hey, hey, kids!

143
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,566
(laughing)

144
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,694
This putz only paid
for 20 seconds,
so listen fast.

145
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,864
(sing-song voice):
Moishe caught the chicken pox,
he scratched all night and day.

146
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,657
He asked the rabbi
what to do, and he said...

147
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,075
-(watch beeps)
-Time. I’m out of here.

148
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,785
(laughs)

149
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,163
(tires squealing)

150
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,584
Kirk, you look good.

151
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,960
Have you been working out?

152
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,920
Well, dogs have been
chasing me...

153
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,380
No one’s been
chasing me lately.

154
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,674
What happened
to your last boyfriend?

155
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,801
The one who’d always
go to the gym
after visiting you,

156
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,970
then have lunch
at that place downtown?

157
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,056
You know,
his taillight’s broken.

158
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,891
I’m not seeing him anymore.

159
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:53,394
Well, does that mean
that there might be
a chance for me?

160
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,314
Almost anyone’s
got a chance now.

161
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,066
(children coughing)

162
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,650
Goodbye, thanks for coming.

163
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,611
If my party made you sick,
tell your friends.

164
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:06,574
(sighing)

165
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,243
Sweet Lizzie McGuire!

166
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,787
You think
<i>that’s </i>traumatic?

167
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,247
Mr. Stomach, are you hungry?

168
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,833
(deep voice):
I’m always hungry.

169
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,544
So make with the pizza,
Fatso.

170
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,213
You’re the stomach.

171
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,173
(slurping and sloshing)

172
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,178
I have to do this for work.

173
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,308
So Milhouse
walks into the bedroom,

174
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,643
and there’s his
mom and dad going...

175
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:37,188
(sensual moaning)

176
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,483
(high-pitched):
Oh, Mr. Van Houten,
I love when you kiss me!

177
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,403
(deep-voiced):
Yeah, yeah, kissing ladies
is the best.

178
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,530
(high-pitched):
Oh, baby, kiss my mouth.

179
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,032
(deep-voiced): Mm, kiss me
like we’re in a fancy hotel.

180
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,867
All right, we get it!

181
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,035
(horrified gasps)

182
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,621
Marge,
what’s happening to me?

183
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,124
Oh, Homie,
you got chicken pox.

184
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,959
But how?

185
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,294
I don’t know. I kept away
from Maggie all day.

186
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,841
Ooh! I’m so itchy!

187
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:10,096
(Bart and Lisa grunting)

188
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,390
Ah. Oh, yeah!

189
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,850
<i>KIRK: Son, we want</i>
<i>to talk to you</i>

190
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,810
about what you saw
in the Simpsons’ house.

191
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,770
Well, I didn’t see anything
to get my hopes up,

192
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,230
if that’s what you mean.

193
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:22,150
Well, maybe you <i>should</i>
get your hopes up a little.

194
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,444
They’re already up!
They’re sky-high!

195
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,154
Your father and I
are going through

196
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,614
what’s called
a "trial un-separation."

197
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,117
And, son, I want to make
one thing clear.

198
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,953
Unlike the breakup,
this is not your fault.

199
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,955
I can’t believe it!

200
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,624

get back together again!

Oh, thank God.

213
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,167
We were afraid
we lost you, son.

214
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,253
You sit in this

That’s the third tub

00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,265
(phone ringing)

221
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,558
Y’ello?

222
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,018
No, I’m not coming
in to work.

223
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,937
I have chicken pox.

224
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,148
I know I said that last month,
but I was lying.

225
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,525
Sheesh.

226
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,360
Right. Right.

227
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,487
Right. Right. Okay.

228
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,364
Right. I love you. Bye.

229
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,074
I just got fired.

230
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,785
Better check the "Want Ads."

231
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,913
Ooh, truck driver
needed in Iraq.

232
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,249
Trucks are like big cars.

233
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,625
Oh...

234
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,043
Okay, Luann.

235
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,711
For honesty’s sake,
we should probably

236
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,006
talk about everyone we dated
while we were separated.

237
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,299
Well, the Sea Captain
and I...

238
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,467
Yeah, okay,
I don’t wanna know.

239
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,635
I don’t wanna know!
I don’t wanna know!

240
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,221
So what are we going
to do as a family today?

241
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,932
Mini-golf? Pedal boats?
Indoor rock wall?

242
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:18,933
Um, Milly...

243
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:19,976
Botanical garden?

244
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,435
Build-A-Bear Workshop?

245
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,396
Arena Football with
the Springfield Stun?

246
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,605
Not today, big guy.

247
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,107
Your dad and I need
more time

248
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,567
to get... reacquainted.

249
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,859
-(chuckling)
-(chuckling)

250
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,112
Why are you laughing?
Tell me!

251
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,655
Private jokes are rude.

252
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,031
Uh, son, here’s ten bucks.

253
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,075
Why don’t you go
to the bowling alley

254
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,368
and throw some solo balls?

255
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,162
But it’s league night!

256
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,163
(Milhouse groaning)

257
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,958
This trial un-separation
stinks.

258
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,085
My parents used
to compete for my love,

259
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,504
and I’d cash in
every time.

260
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,923
And I always got
the spillover.

261
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,593
Drive-in movies,
two Christmases,

262
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,635
soda with dinner...

263
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,678
(sighs)

264
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,555
We lived like kings.

265
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,558
Remember when you told my dad
to go to bed, and he did?

266
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,476
That was some New Years.

267
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,519
Now, listen.

268
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,520
I think we should
consider

269
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,188
breaking
your parents up again.

270
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,690
I don’t know, Bart.

271
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,151
I’ve wanted them
back together for so long.

272
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,861
Look, you know
they’re gonna separate again.

273
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,696
Why don’t we just
speed up the process?

274
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,990
You know, Bart,
my imaginary friend

275
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,451
never made me do things
I thought were wrong.

276
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,120
That’s why he had
to go away forever.

277
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,414
I thought you were gonna
let him come back.

278
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,916
I’m afraid he has
to spend another year

279
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,335
searching for his brain.

280
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,961
(groans)

281
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,130
(grunting)

282
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,008
Luann, I’m moving
my stuff back in!

283
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,927
Uh, Dad...

284
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,347
Mom says you’re stinky
and gross.

285
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,848
Your mother said that?

286
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,518
This is so great.

287
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,063
I mean, she used to keep her
criticisms all bottled up,

288
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,106
until they destroyed
our marriage.

289
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,191
(sniffs)

290
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,193
And I guess
I am a little funky.

291
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,695
Well, this is what cologne
samples are for.

292
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,989
(humming)

293
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,866
(sighs)

294
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,913
Mom, I don’t wanna
get Dad in trouble, but...

295
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,207
he just let me
drink a beer!

296
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,584
Hmm. Looks like
we have a problem here.

297
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,089
The problem being that you are
addicted to fibbing.

298
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,091
I <i>am </i>drunk! I’ll prove it!

299
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,885

301
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,348
Oh, I can’t do it.

302
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,350
She’s so mean to me.

303
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,686
She wouldn’t let me
eat Fruit Loops!

I baked you some cookies.

Skanks for nothing,
Lame-er-ella.

310
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,372

teenagers in Orange County.

312
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:51,669
Austin!

313
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,921
I was looking
for my belly ring
in your recording studio,

314
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,214
and I found this!

315
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,967
Does this or does this not
belong to Feather?

316
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,510
Sorry, Jade.

317
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,011
That’s how we light it up
in the O.C.

318
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,221

00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,899

gonna lift and separate--

341
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,451
lift your mother’s suspicions
and separate your parents.

stop sleeping

Will she know
what this is regarding?

353
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,189
Oh, you moron!

354
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,525
Marge is having
an affair with Kirk!

355
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,360
(scoffs):
That’s ridiculous!

356
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,862
No woman would want to have
sex with that loser!

357
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,489
Oh, I...

358
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,866
And, uh, congratulations
on snagging him back.

359
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,034
Good stuff.

360
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,702
Just answer me
one question.

361
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,497
How did your wife’s bra
end up in my husband’s bed?

362
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,498
(grunts)

363
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,125
(gasps)

364
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,336
This <i>is </i>Marge’s bra.

365
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,673
I bought it for her boobs!

366
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,716
Of all the people
for Marge to cheat on,

367
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,927
why did it have to be me?

368
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,304
Oh, boy, am I beat.

369
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,307
If you wanna return
a melon to the grocery store,

370
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,393
clear your day.

371
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,687
Well, that answers the mystery
of the missing melon,

372
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,814
but I have
one more question--

373
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,066
did you sleep
with Kirk Van Houten?

374
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,110
(gasps):
How could you ask me that?

375
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,445
I repeat--
did you sleep with Kirk?

376
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,239
Homer, you’re crazy!

377
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,282
You’re not saying "no."

378
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,700
Fine... No!

379
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,243
I’m still
not hearing "no."

380
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,870
No! No! No!

381
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,914
Well, methinks the lady
doth protest too much!

382
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,624
You don’t trust me?

383
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,669
After I salved every chicken
pock on your ungrateful body!

384
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,379
How dare you!

385
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,590
I’m still waiting
for that "no."

386
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,591
Get out of this house!

387
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,592
Gladly.

388
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,093
(grunting)

389
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,224
(grunting continues)

390
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,022
(grunting continues)

391
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,401
We tried to break up
your parents,

392
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,069
and we broke up mine.

393
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,031
Wanna call my therapist
and tell her how you feel?

394
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,741
Hello, Dr. Wexler?

395
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,035
<i>WEXLER: Stop calling me!</i>

396
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,828
<i>I’m on my honeymoon!</i>

397
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,040
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>it’s that weird kid again.</i>

398
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,505
-LISA: Dad?
-(gasps)

399
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,674
I thought Mom kicked
you out of the house.

400
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,092
I came to get my mail.

401
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,094
Resident... occupant...

402
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,096
(sadly):
I can’t open these.

403
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,556
Ooh, a traffic ticket!

404
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,645
(sobbing)

405
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,565
I’d do anything
to get your mother
and that donut back.

406
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,192
Okay, look, you and Mom
can fix this.

407
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,110
What exactly happened
between the two of you?

408
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,779
Lisa, we don’t
need to know how.

409
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,364
It’s a natural thing
that happens,

410
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,157
like a hurricane
or going to war.

411
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,492
Hmm...

412
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,785
Well, I’d better go.

413
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:53,827
Where are you staying?

414
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,162
You know
the Four Seasons?

415
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,789
Well, I’m experiencing them
firsthand,

416
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,583
because I’m living
in the park.

417
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:03,253
Bart, I think
you’re behind this whole thing.

418
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,172
Yeah, I can see
how you’d think that.

419
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,924
But on the other hand...
(grunts)

420
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,885
Ha! I can read
you like a book.

421
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,470
Ha-ha, you read books.

422
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,807
If you don’t tell Mom
what you did, I will.

423
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,266
Oh, come on.

424
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,310
Wouldn’t it be easier
if our parents divorced

425
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,562
and you compensated by
marrying much older men?

426
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,815
Meanwhile, I’ll be
one of those weird guys

427
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,734
who’s 35 and shows up
at high school
basketball games.

428
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,154
(sighs)

429
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,157
(groaning)

430
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,827
Why did I marry
that selfish jerk?

431
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,578
I’ve asked him
to flip the mattress

432
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,288
a thousand times,
and he never does.

433
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,877
(grunting)

434
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:44,962
Uh, Mom?

435
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,005
Hi, sweetie.

436
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,881
Uh, you know that bra

437
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,216
that broke up our family?

438
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,217
Uh-hmm.

439
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,011
Well, I looked into it,

440
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,097
and it turns out
I was responsible.

441
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,515
Really?

442
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,350
Well, just for that
I’m gonna erase

443
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,394
all the saved games
on your PlayStation.

444
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,895
What?! How do you know

445
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:02,938
about things like that?

446
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,857
I learned about it in here.

447
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,734
Hmm!

448
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,943
But Dad can come home,
right?

449
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,653
-No.
-But he’s innocent.

450
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,487
Innocent?

451
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:14,074
After all I do for your father,
he still doesn’t trust me.

452
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,451
I’m finished with him.

453
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,494
Does this mean
you and Dad might get

454
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,580
a D-A-V-U-R-S?

455
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,999
Young man, you go work
on your spelling,

456
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,878
or I’ll delete all the custom
ringtones from your cell phone.

457
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,796
No!

458
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,840
Our reverse
parent trap

459
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,341
just made
everything worse.

460
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,886
Maybe we should use a different
movie as our guide.

461
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,345
Like <i>Oklahoma.</i>

462
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:43,729
♪ Oh, the farmer and the cowman
should be friends ♪

463
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,065
♪ One man likes
to push a plow ♪

464
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,067
♪ The other likes
to chase a cow ♪

465
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,278
♪ But that’ s no reason
why they can’t be friends. ♪

466
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,531
(gunfire)

467
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,992
What do you think, Bart?

468
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,744
A hoedown could solve
all our problems.

469
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,412
I just need your chap size.

470
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,289
It’s two more than
your pant size.

471
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,333
How many times
do I have to tell you--

472
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,585
no Rodgers
and Hammerstein!

473
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,711
Rodgers and Hart?

474
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,670
No!

475
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,005
Well, what will
trick your parents

476
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,507
into getting back together?

477
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,093
LISA: Enough
with the tricks!

478
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,762
Stupid movie schemes
do not work in real life.

479
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,931
Mom and Dad have
a marriage on the rocks,

480
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,849
and they need to work
through it in therapy

481
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,893
to make sure it
doesn’t shatter.

482
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:26,105
Rocks... shatter...
jagged cliff...

483
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,982
Lis, you’ve just given me
an idea for the most insane,

484
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,735
hair-brained,
fool-proof scheme ever!

485
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,820
(exasperated groan)

486
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,739
Okay, when my mom and dad
see this dummy fall
in the river,

487
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,282
they’ll think it’s me,
and they’ll realize

488
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,201
what really matters--
each other.

489
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,661
Do you like
the dummy, Bart?

490
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,830
I even made it
smell like you.

491
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,582
Now, to make sure

492
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,251
Homer and Marge are in proper
viewing position...

493
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,921
So, I got your note
saying you wanted

494
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,048
to meet here to apologize.

495
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,175
Well, I got <i>your </i>note
saying you were gonna

496
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,802
bring me
a bucket of potato salad.

497
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,554
Where’s my apology?

498
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,763
Where’s my bucket?

499
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,056
Now, I’ll get
Mom and Dad’s attention,

500
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,141
and you shove the dummy
in the water.

501
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,433
Any questions?

502
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,853
Yeah, what are you going
as for Halloween?

503
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,062
Pile of dog doo.
Let’s roll.

504
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,898
Mom! Dad!

505
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,483
I’m playing
on a dangerous cliff...

506
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,985
because you’re too busy
arguing

507
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,653
to pay attention to me!

508
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,196
(gasps)

509
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,365
Bart! We’re all disappointed
there’s no potato salad,

510
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,409
but for God’s sake,
don’t jump!

511
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,451
(loud whisper):
Now.

512
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,996
I can’t tell which is which.

513
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,790
Oh, no!

514
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,292
I’m already running!

515
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,170
(groans)

516
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,172
Whoa!

517
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,257
I did it, Bart!

518
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,300
Bart?

519
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,801
(screaming)

520
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,803
(grunting)

521
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,729
I’m a-comin’, boy!

522
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,688
(yells)

523
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,317
(screaming)

524
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,947
(Homer humming nonchalantly)

525
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,867
(groans)

526
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,619
(both whimpering)

527
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,914
This is all my fault!

528
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,249
I planted Mom’s bra
in Milhouse’s parents’ bed!

529
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,292
Why you little...

530
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,002
(grunting)

531
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,004
Homer!
I can save you both!

532
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,672
Just let go of the rock!

533
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,673
(whimpering)

534
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,675
Just do it! Trust me!

535
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,760
Okay.

536
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,013
(yelling)

537
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,810
(all moaning)

538
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,773
(panting)

539
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,650
Mom, Dad...

540
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,902
I’d give a kajillion dollars
for you to get back together.

541
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:37,986
Make it two kajillion.

542
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,571
Homer!

543
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,240
We’ll lose the
first kajillion to taxes.

544
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,743
Well, I guess you showed
you do trust me, after all.

545
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,370
Of course I do.

546
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,538
The only thing
I can’t believe
is that a woman

547
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,832
as great as you would be
married to me.

548
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,292
Oh, Homie...

549
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,503
-(both sighing)
-Oh... Marge.

550
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,338
MILHOUSE: I don’t want
to live

551
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:00,425
in a world without Bart!

552
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,468
(gasps)

553
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,636
Can he swim?

554
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,846
