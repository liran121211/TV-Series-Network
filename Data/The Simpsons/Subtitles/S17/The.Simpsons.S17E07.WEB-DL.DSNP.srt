Welcome to the Mayor's Easter
egg hunt.

6
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:33,199
And now, my rarely-seen wife
would like to say a few words.

7
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,035
-(microphone feedback)
-Thank you, Joe.

8
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,954

Hugs Bunny.

10

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Sorry, kid.

11

Legally, I’m not allowed
to hug you.

12
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,007

Joe!

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,427
You said your wife
was dead.

15
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,638
And you said you graduated
from typing school.

16
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,515
I have trouble
with the space bar.

17

18
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,443
Nelson, those don’t count
as Easter Eggs.

19
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,612
Yeah, but they count
as breakfast.

20

(laughs):
Well, Marge,

46
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,519
I didn’t know
you were into wainscoting.

47
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,105
I read an article about
it at the tire store.

48
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,731
Did you know
it’s <i>not </i>named

49

You are now

Homer, please.

75

We’re about to have tea.

76
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,918
No tea.

77
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,461

We throw those
out anyway.

84

I’m still upset about
what happened today.

90
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,617
I don’t have many friends,

91
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,037
and when I finally start
to make some, you ruin it.

92
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,373
Oh, come on, honey,
you have lots of friends.

93
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,999
There’s, uh...

94
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:14,045
Lisa and... the stove.

I am going to find her a friend.

Lisa?

106
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,285
Summer opportunities.

107
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,412
We’re going to Twin Camp.

108
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,539

Oh, my God.

109
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,791
Spend a summer in Rome.

110
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,625
Rome?

111
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,211
Founded by twins,
by the way.

112
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,629
Hey, where’d she go?

113
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,132
Oh, well, let’s talk
in our secret twin language.

114
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:03,303
(nonsensical gobbledygook)

115
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,307
Okay, Lisa, to study in Rome,

116
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,518
an applicant needs
outstanding grades-- check.

117
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:14,063
Uh-oh. Lisa, it says you
have to speak fluent Italian.

118
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,982
Uh... check.

119
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,191
You speak Italian?

120
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,235
Of course I do.

121
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,237
Why would I say it if I didn’t?

122
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,739
(nervous chuckle)

123
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,407
Flawless logic.

124
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,659
But I am going to have to ask
you to speak a few phrases

125
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,244
to verify your fluency.

126
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,121
-(nervous gasp)
-Though not now,

127
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,831
because I have a series
of important meetings.

128
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,541
-(relieved sigh)
-But how’s tomorrow for you?

129
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,376
-(nervous gasp)
-Because it’s
terrible for me.

130
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,378
But I’ll get back to you. Soon.

131
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,839
(moans anxiously)

132
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,550
Son, I need to find a new friend
for your mother.

133
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,802
So you’re gonna have to finish
the shopping yourself.

134
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,137
We’re on food stamps?

135
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,056
I wish.
I made these at work.

Hmm.

138
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,730
I bet she’d be a good friend
for Marge.

139

Yeah, but we don’t sit around

182
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,025
watching television
and eating bonbons.

183
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,902
Except on TV Bonbon Night,

184
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,820
which is every Tuesday
and Thursday.

185
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,489
What are you doing today?

186
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,158
We’re gonna have margaritas and
poke gentle fun at our husbands.

187
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,910
Would you like to join us?

188
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,994
Would I?!

189
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,537
Now, let’s see.

190
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,624
Homer cut up my wedding dress
to make a badminton net,

191
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,667
which he never uses.

192
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,170
He spent my last three birthdays
in jail,

193
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,255
called out his bowling ball’s
name during sex...

194
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,132
Whoa, whoa, whoa, honey!

195
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,134
Save it
for Johnny Fiesta’s.

196
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,810
<i>And now, we return</i>

197
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:44,106
<i>to the Vic Tayback Motel and</i>
<i>Casino in downtown Las Vegas</i>

198
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,817
<i>for </i>Has-Been Celebrity Poker.

199
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,071
<i>As always, all our celebrities</i>
<i>are playing for charity.</i>

200
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:53,157
<i>What?! I am so</i>
<i>out of here.</i>

201
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,577
Wow, Mom, great red dress!

202
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,622
For your information,
I am now a junior member

203
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,250
of the Cheery
Red Tomatoes.

204
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,001
Marge? In a gang?

205
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,461
(laughs)

206
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,671
What’re you gonna do,

207
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,714
shoot me with a frosting gun?

208
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,258
Seriously, I would love that.

209
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:14,428
(all laughing)

210
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,931
Oh, you guys
make everything fun.

211
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,187
(gasps):
That’s my Italian tutor!

212
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,107
Oh, hey, Milhouse.

213
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,025
I think Bart’s upstairs.

214
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,112
I’m not here for Bart.
I’m here to teach you Italian!

215
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,364
Oh, sure, I get it.

216
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,616
Bart told you
I was taking lessons,

217
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,285
so you thought
you’d come over and...

218
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,745
<i>Prego si fermi</i>
<i>ed ascoltare.</i>

219
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,456
That means, "Please
stop and listen."

220
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,375
I’m the tutor
the company sent over.

221
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,379
I’m here to teach you
<i>la lingua di arte e la musica.</i>

222
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,715
You really speak Italian?!

223
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,302
<i>Si. </i>My grandmother,
Nana Sophie, lives in Tuscany.

224
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,346
Since I was a baby, I’ve spent
two weeks there every summer.

225
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,933
<i>Nana hated English,</i>

226
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,978
<i>because in World War II,</i>
<i>a GI left her with child,</i>

227
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,022
<i>my uncle Bastardo.</i>

228
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,316
<i>Nana only spoke Italian to me.</i>

229
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,781
I love you, Nana!

230
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:16,741
Whoa!

231
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:17,617
<i>Idiota!</i>

232
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,077
<i>MILHOUSE:</i>
<i>Every time I spoke English,</i>
<i>she hit me.</i>

233
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,038
Ow! That hurt!

234
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,206
<i>Idiota!</i>

235
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,626
I’m sorry I’m so stupid!

236
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,836
<i>Milhouse Mussolini</i>
<i>Van Houten,</i>

237
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,298
<i>parla Italiano, idiota!</i>

238
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:38,012
(Milhouse yelling)

239
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,599
That’s how I learned Italian
and started wetting my bed.

240
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,601
Anyway, what
do you say?

241
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,436
Can I be your
<i>insegnante?</i>

242
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,688
Okay, if that means,
"Teacher."

243
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,733
It means masculine teacher.

244
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,237
Bye, ladies.

245
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,782
You can text-message me
any time.

246
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,158
We already did!

247
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,201
(gasps)

248
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,952
Ooh!

249
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:02,953
(tires screeching)

250
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,540
Oh, how cute.

251
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,584
(snoring)

252
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,835
He tried to stay up,

253
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,837
but he just couldn’t make it.

254
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,633
(doorbell rings)

255
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,928
<i>Buon giorno, Milhouse.</i>

256
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,888
<i>Ah, perfetto.</i>

257
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,056
(giggles)
Thank you.

258
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,516
I’ve been studying.

259
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,142
I even made flash cards.

260
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,521
(gasps)

261
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,356
My efforts.

262
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,566
Oh, Lisa, you don’t
learn Italian,

263
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,818
you live Italian.

264
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,153
Come, we ride to Little Italy.

265
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,156
But first, I take care of
some classroom business.

266
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,157
Lisa Simpson?

267
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,493
-Present.
-Let’s go.

268
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:48,082
(Italian music playing)

269
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,463
<i>MAN:</i>
<i>Milhouse, che cosa di nuova?</i>

270
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,548
<i>Ciao, Milhouse!</i>

271
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,841
<i>Come stai?</i>

272
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,093
(blowing kisses)

273
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:02,221
<i>Un gelato per la bella ragazza.</i>

274
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,848
"One gelato for..."

275
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,518
Oh... "the pretty girl."

276
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,562
Ah, Mister Milhouse,
thank-a goodness.

277
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:13,441
Could you translate and-a help
me buy cheese for my lasagna?

278
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,068
But, Luigi, surely
<i>you </i>speak Italian.

279
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,570
(sighs)
No, I don’t.

280
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:21,449
I only speak-a, how you say...
fractured English.

281
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,617
That’s what my parents spoke
at home.

282
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,832
I had a wonderful
time today.

283
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,501
<i>Grazie, grazie mill-eh.</i>

284
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,128
(laughs)

285
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,547
I’m the luckiest boy
in the world!

286
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,591
Don’t be in
love, stupid!

287
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,050
(groans)

288
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,602
Tammy, I’d never have
the courage to skydive

289
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,187
if it weren’t
for you girls.

290
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,188
Thanks, Marge.

291
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,773
And, you know, when we land,

292
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,983
we’ve got a little surprise
for you.

293
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,570
Ooh! Well, now I really hope
my chute opens!

294
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,576
MOE:
Goodbye, cruel world!

295
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,161
Ladies.

296
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,583
Marge Simpson,
we hereby induct you

297
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,294
as a full member
of the Cheery Red Tomatoes.

298
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,254
(applause)

299
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,970
I feel a happiness
I’ve never felt.

300
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:29,225
I not only have friends,
I have a hat to prove it.

301
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,935
Now, Marge, as
a full member,

302
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,728
you get to share
in all our secrets.

303
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,897
Like our recipe
for mock apple pie.

304
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,483
The secret is,
it’s got apples in it.

305
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,653
And now we can tell you the
secret plans for our fundraiser.

306
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,239
This year, we’re going to steal
one million dollars

307
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,824
from Mr. Burns.

308
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,325
(gasps)
You’re joking.

309
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,910
You’ve got to be joking.

310
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,587
You’re not joking.

311
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,756
Oh. Any other surprises?

312
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,383
I’m not a natural redhead.

313
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,176
Whoa...

314
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,598
I’m sorry, I can’t steal

315
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,267
Not even from Mr. Burns.

316
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,394
Mr. Burns promised
a million dollars

317
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:16,146
to the Springfield
Children’s Hospital.

318
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,064
And then...

319
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,320
Instead of donating
this money,

320
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:27,491
I’m going to use it to extend
my own life another ten minutes.

321
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,617
Smithers.

322
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,827
(pen squeaking)

323
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,078
And the register.

324
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,623
(booing)

325
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,166
Release the hounds!

326
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,128
(dogs barking,
people screaming)

327
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,256
Why would you bring attack
dogs to a charity event?

328
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,049
I was taking them
to the groomer’s.

329
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,594
Oh, who’s a stinky dog?

330
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,803
You are.

331
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,805
Michelle’s going
to work on you today.

332
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,348
Yes, he is.

333
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,018
There are 12 Faberge eggs
in his vault,

334
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,936
each worth a small fortune.

335
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,900
We can get them,
but we need your special skills.

336
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,570
When I joined, I never thought
we’d be robbing people.

337
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,280
You said you wanted friends.

338
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,074
And the one thing about friends
is that they stick together,

339
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,576
especially when they’re trying
to pull off

340
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,244
a million-dollar
heist.

341
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,455
Maybe we were
a little too quick

342
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,831
to give you that hat.

343
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,916
Take back the hat!

344
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,542
She deserves bare hair!

345
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,461
ALL:
Bare hair! Bare hair!

346
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,755
Okay, okay, okay, I’m in!

347
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,214
You ladies
doing okay down there?

348
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,842
Sorry to wake
you, Stanley.

349
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,970
Don’t let us down,
newbie.

350
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:34,016
Welcome back to Fox Sports West
II Classic Fox Sports Fox.

351
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,978
Hey, Marge,
where you going?

352
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,314
Oh, uh, well, I, um...

353
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,191
bird-watching.

354
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,817
Wait a minute.

355
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,528
If she’s going bird-watching,
why did she leave our

356
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,406
<i>Peterson’s Field Guide to</i>
<i>Birds </i>on the kitchen counter?

357
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,783
(gasps)

358
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,952
Roadrunners are real!

359
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,996
♪ Milhouse is teaching me ♪

360
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,832
♪ To speak so prettily ♪

361
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,126
♪ I’ll quip so wittily ♪

362
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,588
♪ When I’m in Italy ♪

363
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,507
(sighs)

364
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,591
(gasps)

365
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,968
Milhouse!

366
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,095
Just what is going on?

367
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,262
Run along,
Angelica.

368
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,890
But not-a
too fast, eh?

369
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,475
(playfully growls)

370
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,103
Lisa, Lisa.

371
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,021
She is the appetizer,

372
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,148
but you are
the main course.

373
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,858
<i>Sono cosi matto a lei!</i>

374
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,236
<i>Ho pensato abbiamo</i>
<i>avuto qualcosa andando,</i>

375
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,279
<i>e poi la prendo con</i>
<i>questa sgualdrina!</i>

376
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,156
<i>Lei me fa malato!</i>

377
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,784
(normal voice):
Lisa, you’re speaking
perfect Italian!

378
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,035
<i>Grazie.</i>

379
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,161
<i>Idiota!</i>

380
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:42,418
<i>-Idiota! Idiota! Idiota!</i>
-Ow! Ow! Ow!

381
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,461
Now, let’s see
what Marge is up to.

382
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,090
"Recipes, dress patterns,

383
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,633
toaster
undercoating agreement...

384
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,218
Heist plans"?!

385
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,178
(gasps):
Burns’ Mansion?!

386
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,180
That’s Mr. Burns’ mansion!

387
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,356
Remind me, Smithers,
while we’re out.

388
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,150
I need to get my eyes
re-balled

389
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,735
and my brain
flushed out with vinegar.

390
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,194
Yes, sir.

391
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,071
Oh, and your knees will be
back from the shop tomorrow.

392
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,072
Excellent.

393
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,841
Okay, Marge.

394
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,551
You’re the only one of us
skinny enough

395
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,053
to squeeze through this vent.

396
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,388
That’s my special skill?

397
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,766
Well, what’d you think?
You’re a master of disguise?

398
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,142
Not with that do.

399
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,351
I thought you liked my hair.

400
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,478
It’s all right.

401
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,526
(gate squeaks)

402
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,028
I gotta stop Marge

403
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,155
from doing something reckless
and irresponsible.

404
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,075
(screaming)

405
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,579
Lou, we’d better
go after him.

406
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,872
Eddie,
you direct traffic.

407
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:02,831
You’re the graceful one.

408
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,874
You got it, Chief.

409
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,800
WIGGUM:
Look at him tease
that Subaru.

410
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,052
And that guy can’t
find a girlfriend.

411
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,095
I’ll never
figure it out.

412
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,765
I got the combination from Burns

413
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,559
after I let him feel me up
during the Depression.

414
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,686
Zero to the right...

415
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,980
zero to the left...

416
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,399
back to zero.

417
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,574
(sirens approaching)

418
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,368
Marge, I wanted
to save you from the cops,

419
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,120
but the cops followed me.

420
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,914
Game over, man!
Game over!

421
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:47,584
So, are you gonna
introduce me to your friends?

422
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,547
Don’t worry, Mr. Burns.

423
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,923
We’ll get to the bottom of this.

424
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:53,924
Excuse me, Lou.

425
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,300
I’m supposed to say that.

426
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,511
Acting like the chief
doesn’t make you the chief.

427
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,221
If I was acting
like the chief,

428
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,265
I’d need size 58 pants.

429
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,058
Oh, here we go
with the fat jokes.

430
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,435
You know, I just wish you
could hit the easy targets

431
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,770
on the firing range so well.

432
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:12,276
Oh, Lou, why do we
hurt each other so?

433
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,736
Because sometimes
it’s easier to be cruel

434
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,030
than to say what
you really feel.

435
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,782
Permission to hug,
Chief?

436
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,033
Permission...

437
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:20,993
(chokes up)

438
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,077
granted.

439
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,537
Granted, Lou.

440
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,955
Thank you, Chief.

441
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,456
Ooh, enough!

442
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,375
While you morons are canoodling,

443
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,835
someone’s burgling
my miscellania!

444
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,547
(booming gunshot)

445
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,091
Try to take my eggs, will you?

446
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,427
Well, this rooster has a beak.

447
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,847
A beak which calls out
death-a-doodle-doo.

448
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,725
Why... you’re all women.

449
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:45,726
I’m not.

450
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:46,935
I suppose,

451
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,521
but you’re certainly
buxom and flirty.

452
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,983
Oh, well, I try
to have a good time.

453
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,278
All I wanted to do
was join a group of women

454
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,197
who wore the same outfits.

455
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,157
(sobbing)

456
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,203
(all sobbing)

457
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,412
(sighs)

458
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,581
Oh, no jury on earth
will convict

459
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,333
a bunch of moist-eyed
mothers.

460
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,876
I’ll tell you what, ladies.

461
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,503
Give me my eggs back
and I’ll let you go.

462
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,299
(sobbing)

463
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,219
And tell me I’m not fat.

464
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,762
(disgusted groan)

465
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:25,265
Well, I guess our fundraiser
was a failure.

466
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,226
Don’t be so sure.

467
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,813
Ah, Marge, I love you.

468
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,649
But to be safe, sweetie,

469
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,026
I don’t think we can ever
see each other again.

470
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,945
I’ll really miss you guys.

471
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,112
I’ll never forget

472
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,531
the three activities
we did together.

473
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,825
(sniffling)

474
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,202
Listen, Marge.

475
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,246
No matter where
you go in this life,

476
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,997
you’ll always
have one friend

477
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,874
who loves you
body and soul.

478
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,547
And Marge,
there are certain things

479
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,676
I can do for you
that no other friend can.

480
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,803
Special things.

481
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,597
(chuckling)

482
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,851
Wow, this <i>is </i>special.

483
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,144
(thud)

484
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,439
I can’t believe
this happened to me twice.

485
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,195
Shh!
