Where’s Reverend Lovejoy?

8
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,910
He’s never been late
for Christmas service.

9
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,747
Maybe he’s cheating on us
with the Episcopalians.

10
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,166
Look at ’em, with their
bright, airy narthex

11
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,585
and light, flaky Eucharist.

12
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:46,713

00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,720
Bad news, Ned.

16
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:57,140
There’s been
a horrible train wreck.

17
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,727
So many little plastic
Christmases ruined.

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,480
(gasps)
You want me to deliver
the Christmas sermon?

19
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,107

22
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,905
Now, don’t be nervous, Ned.

23
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,907
You’ve practiced this so many
times in the shower.

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,451
Aah! Paper cut!

25
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,828
Ooh...

26
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,458
Now there’s no one
to deliver the sermon.

27
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,418
Did anyone order a hero?

Okay, Christmas... Christmas...

31
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,055
You know how your paper boy
always sends you

32
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,474
a Christmas card
with his home address on it?

33
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,059
What’s up with that?

34
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,685
PAPER BOY: I wanted you
to tip me!

35
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,063
No tip till they bring back
<i>Hagar the Horrible.</i>

36
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,981
That’s not
my decision.

37
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,651
Oh, it’s never
anybody’s decision.

38
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,653
Anyhoo...

39
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,447
I’d like to tell you all
a little story I call

40
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,407
"The First Christmas."

I, for one,

A carpenter named Joseph

44
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,750

<i>preposterous news.</i>

Uh, Joseph,

46
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,713
you know I have never
lain with a man.

47
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,090
(scoffs)
Tell me about it.

48
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,843
And yet, I am with child.

49
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,345
A pregnant virgin?!

50
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,597
That’s every man’s
worst nightmare.

(angelic choir chants)

52
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,309
Hail Mary, full of grace.

53
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,853
That’s not all she’s full of.

54
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,354
Quiet, you.

55
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,648
Mary, you carry in your womb
the Son of God,

56
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,024
who will grow up to become

57
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,651
King of the Jews.

58
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,403
So, not a doctor...

59
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,780
Well, he will be able
to heal the sick.

60
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,157

Frankincense...

66
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,255
And myrrh,
which I am re-gifting,

67
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,798
’cause who needs myrrh?

69
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,634
Thank you.

70

Which one should I open first?

71
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,138
ALL:
Hmm...

72
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,599
(chuckles)
This is awkward.

73
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:07,061
Uh... the King of the Jews
we seek is, uh, a newborn child.

74
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,898
Find this pretender to my throne

75
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,858
and bring him to me.

76
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,985
Uh, now you wouldn’t hurt
the little boychik.

77
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,279
Of course not.

78
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,989
Kings don’t hurt babies.

79
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,824

Good King Herod!

81
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,663
Except you don’t really
have the "good," so...

82
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,124
what do you have,
really, then?

Now, don’t you worry.

00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,964
I got plenty of rooms
at my inn.

00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,132
All with brand-new carpeting.

87
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,717
I think my water
just broke!

88
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,344
You can have the barn.

89
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,138
Now feel free to come
by the main house
for breakfast.

90
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,848
There won’t be any.

the cesarean.

00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,892
Oh! I’m not the father,

107
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,144
I’m not a Wise Man, I’m nothing.

Christmas ever.

110

cheer me up.

suffers in the world,

he starts crying again.

125
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,766
Can you do something?

126
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,728

the Orange Bowl.

Oh... I think

145
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,900
this nontraditional household
just might make it.

(sighs)

147
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,238
Jesus, Mary and Joseph--
we got a great family.

148
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,282
Now, let’s get some sleep.

149
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,117
Herod is coming
for the child.

150
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,870
Manger danger!
Manger danger!

(loud grunting)

152
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,123
The kid you’re looking
for is in there.

153
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,500
The other tenants
have been complaining

154
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,045
about the incessant swaddling--
all hours, day and night.

155
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,215
Uh, gee, Chief, I feel pretty
bad-- trying to take out a baby.

156
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,966
Oh, don’t worry, boys.

157
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,427
No one will ever speak
or write of this again.

158
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,223
What a boffo beginning
for my book!

159
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,558
(loud grunt)

160
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,896
There they are.
I see his head dealy.

161
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,231
Follow that glow!

162
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,900
(shouting)

163
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,402
(quacking)

164
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,112
They put his halo
on a duck.

165
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,406
The oldest trick in the book.

166
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,324
What the hell
are you doing?

167
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,077
Well, he does have a halo.
Hail, Quackie!

168
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,745
-(thunderous rumbling)
-(honks)

169
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,086
That ought
to <i>spruce </i>things up.

170
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,505

171
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,465

172
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,759
(gasping)

173
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,351
What a beautiful Hanukkah bush!

174
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,020
I say we call it
a "Christmas tree."

175
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,313
ALL: Aw...

176
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,858
A Christmas tree...
what a great name.

177
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,318
Makes you feel
all warm and fuzzy.

178
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,029
(moaning and groaning)

179
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,616
And did you know...
that little baby Jesus

180
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,953
grew up to be... Jesus?

181
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,997
(gasping and murmuring)

182
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,665
