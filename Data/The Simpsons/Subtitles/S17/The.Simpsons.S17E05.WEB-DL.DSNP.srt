00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,268
Hey, you...!

186
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,270
-(whispering)
-Uh? What?!

187
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,063
Hey, you’ve...! Oh...

188
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,274
-(whispering)
-Why, you...!

189
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,693
Ah... Yeah.

190
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,866
Mom, all we have is carrot
sticks and fresh fruit.

191
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,161
Well, we could bike to
the tea shop and have some cake.

192
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,954
All right.
Pedal to the kettle.

193
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,332
Hey, Bart,
they’re testing me for lazy eye.

194
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,291
Wanna come with?

195
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,709
Hmm?

196
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,711
Sorry, Milhouse,
I’ve got plans.

197
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,087
(disappointed):
Okay.

198
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,757
I’ll bring you back
an eye care pamphlet.

199
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,384
Okay, here comes our victim.

200
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,220
Let’s bash his head in.

201
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,388
Hey, Moe, I thought
you were just going
to hustle him.

202
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,767
Oh, right. I was thinking
of another thing I’ve got going.

203
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,398
Gimme a bottle of bourbon.

204
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,568
I got a new liver,
and I’m breakin’ it in.

205
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,237
(slight lisp):
Excuse me,

206
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,571
Mr. Bartender, sir.

207
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,074
May I have a sugar-free
ginger ale?

208
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,659
And, uh, make it flat.

209
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,911
The bubbles burn my buds.

210
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,371
Goldarnit, son.

211
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:01,791
What the hell kinda
sissy are you?

212
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,126
Hey, are you callin’
my life partner a sissy?

213
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,629
’Cause a hundred bucks says he
could whup you in arm wrestling.

214
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,340
A "Texas penny" it is.

215
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,259
Yee-haw!

216
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,053
Goldangit!

217
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,265
I’ve been played like
a dimwit’s kazoo.

218
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,599
(grunts)
Oh...!

219
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,684
Yes!

220
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,852
Homer, we make
a dynamite team, huh?

221
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,646
With your arm,
and my head-gunk,

222
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,814
we’re goin’
right to the top.

223
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,482
-(hammers clicking)
-Whoa.

224
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,987
This is one Texan who don’t like
when he’s made out to be a fool.

225
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,905
Well,
what do you like?

226
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,784
I dunno, a good book,
long walk on the beach.

227
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,372
So, we, uh, we kinda
evened things up here?

228
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,623
Not yet.

229
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,833
I wanna play some Frisbee.

230
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,837
You know, honey,
I’ve really started

231
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,171
to look forward
to our little bike rides.

232
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,715
Me, too, Mother.

233
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,049
Ooh, such respect.

234
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,552
You could grow up
to be a doorman.

Uh... she died.

Hmm?

244
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,287
Well, Bart,
I guess that’s it.

245
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,040
We’ll have to go back
to our separate things.

246
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,083
Hey, we could have tea
in my tree house.

247
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:31,172
<i>You </i>invited <i>me</i>

248

Wow!

249

That’s like Bruce Wayne letting
his mother into the Bat Club.

(slurping)

251
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,975
(groans)

252
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,063
So... is that standing water?

253
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,731
-Yeah.
-(buzzing)

254
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,609
You know, that puddle started
life as a bowl of cereal.

255
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,235
(nervously):
Oh...

256
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,154
Hmm. Hmm.

257
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:59,241
I think I might be able to turn
this tree house into a teahouse.

258
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,705
Mom, this is great.

259
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,124
It makes our real house
look like a pile of crap.

260
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,918
And I threw out
all your old comics.

261
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:09,919
Mom!

262
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,087
(laughing)

263
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,588
Just kidding.

264
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,799
Today’s mom knows
to seal them in Mylar

265
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,592
so you can never
read them again.

266
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,678
Never, ever again.

267
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,515
Where are you two going?

268
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,684
I’m joining the professional
arm-wrestling circuit.

269
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,352
Uh-huh.

270
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,396
And how will this affect
your job at the power plant?

271
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,939
Negatively, I assume.

272
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,399
Oh. Well, we’re off

273
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,733
to buy a new tea set.

274
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,361
Have fun.

275
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,612
(car doors closing)

276
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,116
Gee, she didn’t seem angry
or anything.

277
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,535
Maybe she doesn’t care anymore.

278
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,744
Forget about it, Homer.

279
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,704
She’s dead to you now.

280
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,372
O...kay.

281
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,998
Now, if we get bored
on the bus,

282
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,500
I got a book
of brain teasers here.

283
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,918
Let’s see, uh...

284
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,379
Oh, "Brothers and sisters
have I none,

285
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,966
but this man’s father
is my father’s son."

286
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,968
Huh...

287
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,178
Ah, screw you,
you stupid thing.

288
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,557
"He is my son."

289
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,267
That blows.

290
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,857
I can’t wait to use our new
Krusty the Clown tea service!

291
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,442
Me, neither.

292
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,443
Oh, my God.

293
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,694
I took
the salesman’s pen.

294
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,780
I’ll be right back.

bring it back

for you.

into being a mama’s boy.

mine again.

You’re not
allowed in here!

362
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,630
(sad music plays)

363
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,488
Hey, Mom.

364
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,949
Hello, Bart.

365
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,493
Just so you know,
I sold our bike.

366
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,621
(laughing):
Faster! Faster!

367
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,497
BOTH:
Whoa!

368
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,583
(all shouting)

369
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,376
But we had so much fun
on that bike!

370
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,128
(yelling)

371
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,882
Mom, I really did
like hanging out with you.

372
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:29,178
(whines)

373
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:33,307
You know, there’s a karaoke
night at school tomorrow.

374
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,393
Some of the little kids
are bringing their parents.

375
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,561
Do you want to go?

376
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,854
Really?

377
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,147
Could we do a duet?

378
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,440
Sure. Why not?

379
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,775
(chuckles)

380
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,151
It’ll be fun.

381
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,653
It’s still happening!

382
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,536
Oh, I can’t believe
Marge hasn’t called me.

383
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,996
Maybe I should
go home.

384
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,331
Oh, Marge called you.

385
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,124
She said, uh,
that she loves you

386
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,251
and she hopes
you break the guy’s arm so hard

387
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,795
that it pokes through his skin.

388
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,296
Did she say anything else?

389
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,215
Yeah, she said to shut up,
stop asking questions,

390
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,383
and listen to Moe.

391
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,343
Oh, Marge,
I love her so much.

392
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,928
Now, Homer, you got
to keep your head

393
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,304
in the game,
all right?

394
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,472
Your first opponent

395
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,265
is Lefty "The Righty"
Leftwright.

396
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,521
Oh, he looks tough.

397
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,772
Yeah, he only
lost once:

398
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,607
in his fight
against illiteracy.

399
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,900
I can relate.

400
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,319
I fought that foe
and lost many times.

401
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,821
(phone ringing)

402
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,743
(whiny):
Oh, Marge isn’t home.

403
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,412
Homer, focus.

404
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,123
Moe, I’m starting to have
grave doubts about this thing

405
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,916
I barely liked
in the first place.

406
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,792
Come on, Homer.

407
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,211
We can make it all the way
to the quarterfinals

408
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,671
for the Eastern Division,
Class B,

409
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,965
over-35, Amateur grouping!

410
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:48,966
-Sorry, Moe.
-(grunts)

411
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,218
The place for my arm
is around my wife.

412
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,469
-(crackling)
-(yells)

413
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,387
Homer, come back.

414
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,098
You got my teeth-whitening
system in your suitcase!

415
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,561
Let’s see...
what would be a good duet?

416
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,354
Hmm.

417
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,399
"Just the Two of Us,"
"You and Me Against the World,"

418
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,483
"Ebony And Ivory"?

419
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,235
"Ebony and Ivory"?

420
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,653
(chuckling):
I’m afraid that
song’s taken.

421
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,946
by me and my mother.

422
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,740
You know, people say when
we’re on stage,

423
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,159
it’s more
like scary-oke.

424
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,994
Uh, scary talented,
I assume.

425
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,371
I’m singing a song
with Bart tonight.

426
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,582
Capital. My mother and I have
been performing together

427
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,752
since I was in fourth grade, and
it’s really brought us closer.

428
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,004
Seymour,
where were you?

429
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,715
A brightly-colored car
hurt my eyes.

430
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,508
Don’t worry, Mother,
I have your eye balm

431
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,927
in my man-purse
right here.

432
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,596
Good boy.

433
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,390
You can push your crib
into mommy’s room tonight.

434
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,601
It’s not a crib.
It’s a cot.

435
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,270
If it has rails,
it’s a crib!

436
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,481

437
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,691

00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,384
But seeing us dressed
the same really feels right.

447
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,220
Well, now I’m not so sure
about the bells

Hush up, Seymour.

466
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,690
She’s just saying
what we’re all thinking.

467
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,191
Mother,
what are you doing?

468
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,234
Don’t call me Mother.

469
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,861
My name is Mom.

470
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,613
And my son
is no mama’s boy!

471
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,656
(all gasping)

472
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,200
Bart, you are
a wild heck-raiser,

473
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,244
and I don’t want to see you
turn into that.

474
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,079
What, a wall?

475
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,373
Mom, I thought this
was what you wanted.

476
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,625
Your job isn’t
to worry about me.

477
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,713
It’s to give me things
to worry about.

478
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,716
Hmm.

479
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:40,429
Hey, losers, I’m gonna do to you
what you did to these songs.

480
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,264

is more
important to me
