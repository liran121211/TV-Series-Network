Oh, Lisa, do you really

255
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,598
Mom, I think there’s

256
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,141
they might lose

As a young child, did Lisa

Frankly, no.

262

Mr. and Mrs. Simpson,

Lisa had to suppress her
childhood fears.

My ten-week program can help
her learn to be a kid again.

276
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,329
Well worth the $4,000.

277
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,039
$4,000?

278
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,792
Now, Marge, when our
little girl’s happiness

And you won’t!

284

Unless you can leap
through fire!

285
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,812
I can’t keep sleeping
in Mom and Dad’s room.

286
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,438
Yeah, if Dad rolls over,
you’re dead.

287
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,232
Mom showed me how to make
a retaining wall

315
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,885

00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,097
Bye, Lisa.

318
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,934
And remember, you have
a checkup next Thursday.

319
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,477
We don’t go
to you anymore.

320
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,187
We have a better doctor.

321
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,272
Oh, congratulations!

322
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,489
Boys, that grave robber
could be anywhere.

323
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,075
The most vital thing
is that we stick together.

324
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,327
Wait.
Where did everybody go?

325
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,870
Okay, this is it, Clancy.

326
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,998
No squad car, no backup,
legs cramping in fear,

327
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,334
sweat in my eyes
and groin...

328
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,836
Oh, I’d better get out
of this damn cop uniform

329
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,756
before someone
takes a shot at me.

330
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,800
There we go.

331
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,677
Oh, hey, there’s my Walkman.

332
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,721
(music playing)

333
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,894
You know, I actually
got into law school,

334
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:19,937
but I just couldn’t
afford it.

335
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,730
Quiet, I hear something.

336
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,065
Yeah, that’s my life
slipping away.

337
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,191
(guns cock)

338
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,026
Okay, got to keep calm.

339
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,112
If <i>Scooby Doo</i>
has taught me anything,

340
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,655
it’s that the only thing
to fear

341
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,407
are crooked
real estate developers.

Where’s Lisa, boy?

350
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,981
This book’s going to solve
all her problems.

351
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:04,815
Well, if you’re looking
for Lisa,

352
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,150
she said she was going
to spend the night

353
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,234
in the bone yard out back.

354
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,152
The cemetery?

355
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,029
And you’re just
sitting here?

356
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,947
I figured the best thing
I could do

357
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,283
is monitor the news
for any reports.

358
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,909
You’re watching
cartoons!

359
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,207
Hmm! Just the show for me!

360
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,552
Tim-Tom Tabby
is a curious cat.

361
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,430
Went to see the queen
in a velveteen hat.

362
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,848
(moans)

363
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,601
This is so boring!

364
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,022
Shh!

365
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,356
(laughing)

366
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,567
Hey, Mom, can we have
fried chicken for dinner?

367
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,360
HOMER/MARGE: Lisa!

368
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,030
BOTH: Lisa! Lisa!

369
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:56,408
Don’t worry,
we’re not evil spirits!

370
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,494
Although,
if we were evil spirits,

371
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,662
we’d probably assume
the shape of your parents.

372
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,747
Homer!

373
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,707
Marge, we owe her
the truth.

374
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,298
(screaming)

375
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,510
(grunts)

376
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,386
There, there, dear.

377
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,264
Grandma will protect you.

378
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,017
But I ain’t grandma!

379
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,602
(screaming)

380
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,104
Oh, whoa-whoa-whoa!

381
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,440
(gasps)

382
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,153
Lisa, meet
your new husband.

383
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,029
(chuckles)

384
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,365
I made us a dream house
out of slime!

385
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,785
I don’t know
how I reproduce,

386
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,538
but we’ll have a great time
figuring it out.

387
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,998
(screams)

388
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,250
(grunts)

389
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,835
(groans)

390
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,461
Where am I?

391
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,713
(growling and roaring)

392
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,217
(screaming)

393
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,138
Welcome to the Land of
Wild Beasts, little girl.

394
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:03,559
(growling and roaring)

395
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,560
(whimpers)

396
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,562
Not scared. Not scared.

397
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,774
For God’s sake, girl,
you’re eight years old.

398
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,110
It’s natural for you
to feel scared sometime.

399
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,404
But I’m too smart
to get scared.

400
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,698
Lisa, everybody
gets scared,

401
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,908
no matter how old
or how smart they are.

402
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,286
In fact,
I’m scared of her.

403
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,330
No, you’re afraid
of intimacy.

404
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,040
That’s because I know
after we mate,

405
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,167
you’ll eat me.

406
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,419
Your brother
didn’t seem to mind.

407
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,088
You know,
you monsters seem scary,

408
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,257
but when you get
a little closer...

409
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,342
(chuckles):
You’re just funny.

410
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,178
(grunting approval)

411
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:43,807
But wait.

412
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,267
How am I supposed to sleep

413
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,561
with that spooky cemetery
outside my window?

414
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,564
You could just draw the blinds,
you silly goose.

415
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,232
Or get a night-light.

416
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,276
My dad says
they’re too expensive.

417
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,194
(grumbling disapproval)

418
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,321
For God’s sake,
they’re four bucks apiece.

419
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,114
I could slime your dad,

420
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,034
just like I slimed us
a Paris honeymoon.

421
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,789
I think I’ll be
okay by myself.

422
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,210
What is it about slime
that chicks don’t dig?

423
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,005
Bye, guys.

424
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,965
You’ve really
helped me a lot.

425
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,091
-Bye-bye, Lisa.
-Bye, Lisa!

426
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,885
See you soon!

427
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,389
We’re always
just a concussion away!

428
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,935
Lisa, honey,
please wake up.

429
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,603
If you do,
I’ll get you a new pony.

430
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,104
New pony?

431
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,106
Uh... this is still
part of your dream.

432
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,901
(singsongy):
Dreaming... dreaming...

433
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,069
Now you’re awake.

434
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,779
Oh. Mmm!

435
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,198
Sweetie, we’re going
to get you home

436
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,992
and straighten out
all these fears you have.

437
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,036
I think I’m going
to be fine.

438
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,287
Let’s get
some breakfast.

439
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,794
Uh, Chief, it’s light out.

440
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,796
You can open your eyes
and come down.

441
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:56,922
I don’t want to, Lou!

442
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,632
I’ve got a pizza bagel
for you.

443
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,050
Let’s roll.

444
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:51,977
Shh!
