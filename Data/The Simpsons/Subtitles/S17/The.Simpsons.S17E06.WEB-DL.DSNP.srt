00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,993
Oh, can I come with you?

27
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,244

to buy Dad a present?

31
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:27,212
If I give you money,
how is the gift really from you?

32
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,755
Where do you get your money?

33
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,381
Here’s a ten.

34
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,800
Make your own card.

36
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,643
Now, Ralphie, let me
explain it to you again.

37
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,813
I give you $5 and
you buy Daddy a present.

38
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,523
Okeydokey.

39
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,275
Hey, hey, give
me that. Eww...

40
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,611
Whoa, this is a 50.

41
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,696
This kid’s
finally paying off.

42
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,407
All right, Ralphie, let’s see
what you can do with a hundred.

43
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,993
Come on, Ralphie.

44
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,203
Big money. Big
money, Ralphie.

45
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,289
Big money.

That’s what I’m getting.
How ’bout you?

49
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,687
I’m afraid the best thing
I could find is this.

50
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,522
<i>Ay caramba.</i>

51
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:28,815
You know,

52
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:33,319
this mass-produced junk doesn’t
express how <i>I </i>feel about Dad.

53
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,948
I am making him a present
that comes from the heart.

54
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,705
Hello. I’m looking for something
in a pipe cleaner,

55
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,583
extra bendy,
with medium fuzz.

56
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,460
Mm-hmm. This just
came in from Zanzibar.

57
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,753
Oh.

58
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,463
Mm-hmm.

59
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,008
<i>HOMER:</i>
<i>What a great Father’s Day!</i>

60
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,050
Here you go, Dad.

61
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,135
I hope you like it.

62
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,803
I’ve forgotten what it is.

63
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,556
(gasps)
A Leather Buddy.

64
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,684
There’s no limit
to what I can do with this.

65
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,979
Fear not, m’lady,
Captain Dash Superstud

66
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,440
is here
with his small tool.

67
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,108

68
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,197
(grunting)

69
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,413
Arr. This is the worst
Father’s Day ever.

70
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,415
(groans)

71
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,376
Oh, Captain,
you’re so handy.

72
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,505
Bart, this is the greatest
present I ever received.

73
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,758
To open another gift now
would be like following

74
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,969
the London Philharmonic
with Jessica Simpson.

75
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,262
What you got, Lisa?

76
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,097
What the hell is this?

77
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,349
Mm.

78
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,643
The unicorns
are you and me, Dad.

79
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,852
I drew it myself.

80
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,150
LISA:
What do you think? Huh? Huh?

81
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,986
Pretty heartfelt, huh? Huh?!

82
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,238
Oh, it’s heartfelt.

83
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,822
There’s no escaping that.

84
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,324
(chuckles):
Thanks, honey.

85
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,035
You didn’t like it, did you?

86
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,495
No, no, no,
it’s great.

87
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,996
I’m done with it now.

88
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,334
Lisa, sweetie,
I think your father

89
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,544
would like to put your
book up on the fridge

90
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,089
where everyone can
see how nice it is.

91
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,051
Aw, isn’t that cute?

92
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,932
Oh, Dad...

93
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,267
how could you?

94
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,601
Well, it’s not my fault.

95
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,561
Lousy magnet!

96
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,189
(sobbing):
Oh, no, no.

97
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,025
What the...

98
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,443
"Happy Birthday, Dad!
From Lisa."

99
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,444
D'oh!

100
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,534
(groans)

101
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,576
I still don’t
understand

102
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,578
how <i>her </i>feelings
can be hurt.

103
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,830
It’s my day.

104
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,790
She’s not going
to get over this quickly.

105
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,041
I know women.

106
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,377
Yeah, but I know
how to win women back.

107
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,380
I even won <i>you </i>back after I lost
our wedding album in a bar bet.

108
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,798
You what?

109
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,675
I mean, I will win you back.

110
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,469

115
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,565

Cool, I’m a street.

120
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,244
Hey, Simpson,
are you gonna steal the sign?

121
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,246
Yeah, if a sign’s
got your name on it,

122
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,456
you can take it,

123
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,499
and the cops can’t
do nothing about it.

124
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,501
It’s like the Sixth Amendment
or something.

125
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:40,590
Well, that sign would look good
hidden under my bed.

126
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:46,596
Whoa. Can we dish out
the peer pressure, or what?

127
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,890
-Huh!
-Hey, Milhouse!

128
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,976

00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,068
I’m out of here.

133
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,235
I’ve got
Hebrew school.

134
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,155

136
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,039
I’m sorry
I made you feel bad, honey.

137
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,209
But I’m gonna show you just how
much I care about your feelings.

138
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,960
One adult
and one baby, please.

139
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,255
I’m not a baby.
A baby is zero to two.

140
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,716
Her first words.

141
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,886
Play along.
It’s 50 cents less for babies.

142
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,930
I’d rather not go than lie.

143
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,643
How you doing?

144
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:37,688
So... is that your jacket
on the back of that chair?

145
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,692
Check it out.
I stole the sign.

146
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,986
Check it out.
We stole "The Scream."

147
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,613
Put that away.
It creeps me out.

148
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,782
(muttering)

149
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:51,327
Stupid Dad doesn’t care
about my feelings.

150
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,580
Oh Lisa, may I borrow
one of your colored pencils?

151
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,458
Sure, that’s all you men do,
is take, and take, and take

152
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,710
without regard to feelings
or unicorns.

153
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,795
(grunts)

154
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,214
Here, take my lunch, too.

(grunts)

156
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,008
Just take my whole backpack!

157
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,093
(grunts)

158
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,973
Which of you boys
hurled Lisa Simpson’s backpack

159
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,349
through my window?

160
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,561
Oh, it had to be a boy, did it?

161
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,396
You think a girl can’t flip out?

162
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,273
Well, you’re wrong!

163
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,608
(Lisa grunting)

164
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,861
My flexi-cast.

165
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,904
(Lisa grunting)

166
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,532
Yah!

167
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,367
(whinnies excitedly)

168
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,577
Lisa...

169
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,663
I hold in my hand a sticker
with a frowny face on it.

170
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,374
Don’t make me affix it
to your file.

171
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,002
(mockingly):
Don’t make me affix it
to your file.

172
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,672
I’m peeling off the back.

173
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:48,092
Don’t make me do this.

174
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,220
May God forgive me.

175
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,931

176
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,976

177
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,228
Willie, we’ve got rats chewing
through the wiring again.

178
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,438
Leave me alone.

179
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,273
I’m making me Ramen noodles.

180
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,197
Mr. and Mrs. Simpson,

181
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,408
I’m afraid we have
a real problem with Lisa.

182
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,493
(glass shatters)

183
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,790
Your daughter broke a window,
upended an ashcan,

184
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,543
and hurled a Thermos-brand
thermos onto the street!

185
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,129
Does it still keep hot drinks
hot and cold drinks cold?

186
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,798
I’m afraid it doesn’t keep
any drinks anything.

187
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,342
(gasps)

188
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,511
I’ve asked the school
psychologist to shed some light

189
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,804
on your daughter’s sudden burst
of inappropriateness.

190
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,682
I’m afraid Lisa’s rage

191
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,101
stems from extraordinary
disillusionment

192
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,020
with a parental figure.

193
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,022
In this case, her father.

194
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,609
Oh, sure, it’s easy
to point out my faults.

195
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,736
It’s a little harder
to shut up.

196
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,321
Looking at
your daughter’s essays,

197
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,657
this isn’t a new trend.

198
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,408
"Daddy’s Face-Down
Thanksgiving."

199
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,369
"Left at the Grand Canyon."

200
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,829
"The Day a Policeman Came
to My Soccer Game."

201
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,333
Mr. Simpson,
Lisa is at a crucial juncture.

202
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,293
If she doesn’t
see her father

203
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,711
as a positive role model,

204
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,381
she could hate men
for the rest of her life.

205
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,258
Oh, I know!

206
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,135
But how can I undo
eight years of jerkiness

207
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,930
in two easy sessions,
at no cost to me?

208
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,808
If, uh, I may
make a suggestion?

209
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,144
The school is looking
for a new "Safety Salamander."

210
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,355
When Lisa sees you
teaching children

211
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,107
to avoid downed power lines,

212
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,150
it could restore her faith
in you <i>and </i>the male gender.

213
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,944
Oh, I don’t know.

214
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,862
What happened to the last
Safety Salamander?

215
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,198
Um, he fell asleep
in the suit and suffocated.

216
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,783
I can do that!

217
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:39,620
Okay, Lisa, time for
Daddy’s big surprise!

218
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,080
(Homer growls; Lisa screams)

219
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,081
(laughing)

220
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,374
Sometimes it’s scary

221
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,126
when your dreams come true,
isn’t it, sweetie?

222
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,168
I guess.

223
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,420
Yeah.

224
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,963
Now, I’m off to bring safety

225
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,549
to Springfield Elementary
and win back your love!

226
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,050
Whoa!

227
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,051
-Ugh!
-What’s that, honey?

228
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,094
I can’t hear you very well.

229
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,221
(gurgling)

230
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,265
Salamander away!

231
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,436
(crashing)

232
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,437
(cat yowls)

233
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,896
Sorry, Bart!

234
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,898
HOMER:
The first rule of bus safety is

235
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,109
always wear
your seatbelt.

236
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,194
School buses
don’t have seatbelts.

237
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,447
Then what protects you
if we crash?

238
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,698
A metal bar at tooth level.

239
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,199
Stop this bus!

240
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,409
(tires screeching;
metal clanking)

241
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,327
(kids groaning)

242
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,494
MILHOUSE:
My teeth!

243
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,288
Look, Lisa--

244
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,456
I made safety
happen.

245
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,458
(groans)

246
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,376
HOMER:
Safety tip 99:

247
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,545
always double-bolt your easel.

248
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,631
-(snapping)
-Ow! Son of...

249
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,757
(panting)

250
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,759
Uh... questions? Comments?

251
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,260
Are you a girl?

252
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,346
Cause I don’t see
a <i>sala-wiener.</i>

253
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,430
(laughing)

254
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,184
Did I hear
"Where are the fireworks?"

255
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,728
’Cause here they are!

256
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,273
(audience "oohing")

257
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,109
(screaming)

258
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,110
(Homer joins screaming)

259
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,111
Every man for himself!

260
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,322
Trample if you must!

261
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,907
(panicked screams)

262
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,824
(fire alarm blaring;
Homer panicking)

263
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,868
(kids straining)

264
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,621
(Homer sobbing)

265
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,456
Safety! Safety!

266
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,500
Die for safety!

267
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,544
(groaning sobs)

268
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,506
(siren wails)

269
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,133
So, sweetie,
am I your hero again?

270
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,553
Janey’s father just takes her
to the zoo once a month.

271
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,180
Couldn’t you be
that kind of dad?

272
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,682
Now, honey, you know

273
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,017
Daddy’s not allowed
in the zoo anymore.

274
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,519
Oh, yeah.

275
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,895
But I’ll never
stop trying

276
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:31,190
to redeem myself
in your eyes.

277
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,525
How did you do that?

278
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,693
I don’t know.

279
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,784
I said, turn left
on Bart Boulevard!

280
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,204
I’m tellin’ you there
t’ain’t no Bart Boulevard!

281
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,665
Forget it.
Baby’s already out.

282
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,125
Just get out
your huntin’ knife

283
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,127
and cut
the "umbrellical" cord.

284
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,211
Yes’m.

285
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,797
(tires screeching; crashing)

286
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,048
Hey!

287
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:56,882
Watch it!

288
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:57,800
Ow!

289
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,678
This is Kent Brockman,
live at the scene

290
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,930
of the worst accident
in Springfield history.

291
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,306
But not to worry,

292
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,350
the city’s emergency services
are on the way.

293
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,979
(sirens wailing)

294
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,021
(crashing)

295
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,775
(crashing and screaming)

296
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,405
Can we all agree not to get
our insurance involved?

297
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,656
Come on, people. Be cool.

298
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:27,246
Springfield needs a hero,
and it needs one now!

299
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,291
This looks like a job

300
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,626
for a dad trying to win back
his daughter’s love!

301
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,716
I’m forever indebted to you...

302
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,676
and my many creditors.

303
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,056
We were car pooling--
and that’s it!

304
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,482
My mother’s still
in the car!

305
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,360
No, she’s not.

306
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,612
Ha-ha!

307
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,492
Three cheers for
our new hero!

308
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,702
Only three?

309
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,370
Okay, six!

310
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,664
That’s more like it!

311
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,833
Hip-hip hurray!
Hip-hip hurray!

312
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,711
Oh, please,
you’re embarrassing me.

313
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,550
I hereby award you
Springfield’s highest honor:

314
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,762
the key card to the city.

315
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,891
Now, any new business?

316
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,726
Mr. Mayor,
your administration has been

317
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,269
one fiasco after another!

318
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,395
Who the hell are you?

319
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,897
Your press secretary.

320
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,232
I knew I should have hired
my nephew.

321
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,817
I <i>am </i>your nephew.

322
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,860
Okay, so I stink.

323
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,487
Tough Toblerone.

324
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,408
Read the charter, people:
I cannot be removed from office.

325
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,703
Except by a simple
recall election...

326
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,581
Err, uh, disregard
that last part.

327
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,417
ALL (chanting):
Recall! Recall! Recall!

328
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,838
Recall! Recall! Recall!

329
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,007
<i>Recall! Recall! Recall!</i>

330
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,386
PARROTS: (squawking):
Recall! Recall! Recall!

331
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,013
Mayor Diamond Joe Quimby
has survived

332
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,057
12 reelection campaigns,

333
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,685
countless accusations of
infidelity, bribery, extortion,

334
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:16,021
and his bizarre attempt
to hijack a 747.

335
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,941
Take this plane anywhere
girls are going wild.

336
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,193
But the Mayor may have
a tougher time

337
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,821
getting past next month’s
special recall election.

338
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,823
Over 200 candidates have filed,

339
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,242
including yours truly,
Kent Brockman.

340
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,620
In other news, a common
household fabric can kill you!

341
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,666
Find out which one when you vote
for Kent Brockman.

342
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,626
Dear God, every wacko, nutcase

343
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,212
and Disco Stu in this town
is gonna run against me.

344
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,424
Just imagine--
me, the mayor!

345
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,886
Then nobody would laugh
at my singin’!

346
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,139
♪ I’m proud
to be an American... ♪

347
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,891
I am so screwed.

348
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,769
Vote Luigi!

349
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,731
I make-a the good government,
just the way you like.

350
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:02,943
Vote for me,
a steroid-abusing,
pot-smoking,

351
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,029
woman-groping, son-of-a-Nazi,

352
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:08,115
washed-up, has-been movie star!

353
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,700
(cheering)

354
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,536
Oh, also, I believe
we should keep an open mind

355
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,204
towards stem cell research.

356
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,081
(crowd booing)

357
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,750
(Wolfcastle groans,
loud, angry chattering)

358
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,585
This election is
out of control.

359
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,129
Someone terrible
could win!

360
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:26,050
If you’re lame enough to vote,
vote for me.

361
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:30,512
<i>ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>Jimbo: Tough on nerds,</i>
<i>tougher on dorks.</i>

362
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,014
Dad, we got to
do something.

363
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,475
What can <i>I </i>do?
I’m only one man.

364
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,268
Lincoln was only one man.

365
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,395
Are you sure there wasn’t
a midget in his hat?

366
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,022
I read an e-mail
that said there was.

367
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,690
Look, as the Safety
Salamander,

368
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,900
you are beloved
by all.

369
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,735
And if you were the Mayor,

370
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,695
we could make sure
that only good people,

371
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,238
like me, tell you what to do.

372
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,990
Hmm.

373
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,867
I will run for mayor!

374
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,662
And I will be
your campaign manager!

375
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,498
And I’ll find out
what a mayor does!

376
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:01,418
Expand my brain, learning juice!

377
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,391
Oh, I hate
press conferences.

378
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,267
Homie, you might
score more points

379
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,269
if you didn’t wear
that salamander suit.

380
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,604
You look like
the mascot

381
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,982
for some horrible
Southern college.

382
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,566
Marge, without this outfit,

383
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,069
I’m just Homer Simpson,
multiple felon.

384
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,737
With it,
I’m a costumed hero,

385
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,490
like George Washington
or Dame Edna.

386
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,075
(cheering, fanfare plays)

387
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,869
Today marks a new dawn
for Springfield.

388
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,747
This salamander is sitting
on eggs labeled "elder care,"

389
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,042
"flex-time,"
and "downtown pedestrian mall."

390
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,878
And those eggs
are ready to hatch!

391
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,880
(cheering)

392
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,590
Now, I will take your questions.

393
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,884
Uh, what special powers
would a salamander bring

394
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,845
to the office of mayor?

395
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:57,224
Well, there’s my X-ray vision,
my fire breath,

396
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,309
and I can get big laughs
with tennis balls.

397
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,146
Bloop, bloop, bloop.

398
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,232
(laughter)

399
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,650
Wow! l didn’t know

400
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,527
salamanders could do
all those things.

401
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,071
And to think, for
all these years, I’ve
been a gecko man.

402
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,032
Take a hike, jerk.

403
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,868
Mr. Simpson, what about
those photos of you

404
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,662
strangling your child?

405
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,831
Why should we let this election
be influenced

406
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,750
by a photo taken hours ago?

407
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,710
(cheering)

408
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:28,047
Now, restaurant matchbooks
for everyone!

409
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,299
CROWD ( <i>chanting </i>):
Sala-mander!

410
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,967
Sala-mander! Sal...

411
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,303
Homer, you’re doin’ great.

412
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,846
You’re way ahead in the polls.

413
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,848
Even those negative campaign ads
aren’t hurting you.

414
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,309
Simpson barely even comes
into work anymore.

415
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,478
He pays a homeless man
to do it for him.

416
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,731
I, um...
I don’t feel so good, Blue.

417
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,066
(laughs)

418
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,193
Hey, people may not
love Homer Simpson,

419
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,778
but they love this suit.

420
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:51,987
(chuckles)

421
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,656
Just like they love their stupid
American flag.

422
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,116
(loud gulping)

423
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,872
Oh, what’s that smell?

424
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:05,000
It’s the smell
of impending victory.

425
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,169
-(retching)
-Did you just vomit in that
suit?

426
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,212
A little.

427
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,880
<i>Oh!</i>

428
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,424
Have you cleaned that suit once
since you got it?

429
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,926
No, but I swam in it.

430
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,636
Ugh! I’d better wash that thing.

431
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,179
It’s hard to know

432
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,098
where the suit ends
and you begin.

433
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,641
Yeah.

434
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,060
But aren’t <i>you </i>gonna
have fun finding out?

435
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,978
No!

436
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,356
(clucking)

437
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,524
That’s weird.

438
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,150
Started off as an egg.

439
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,989
KENT BROCKMAN:
Our next question goes
to Eleanor Abernathy,

440
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,117
also known
as the Crazy Cat Lady.

441
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,451
Uh, Cat Lady,

442
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,246
how would you boost the
city’s commercial tax base?

443
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,873
(speaking gibberish)

444
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,209
Small business incentives...

445
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,962
(gibberish continues)

446
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,922
Corporate accountability.

447
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,966
(speaking gibberish)

448
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,093
Cats in everyone’s pants!

449
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,220
All right, thank you, Cat Lady.
See you in the spin room.

450
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,515
(mumbling):
Okay, okeydokey... yeah.

451
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,600
Our next question is
for the Safety Salamander.

452
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,812
(cheering)

453
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:10,899
Sir, how would you restore our
city’s crumbling infrastructure?

454
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,151
That’s an excellent question,
Kent.

455
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,402
First of all...

456
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,905
What the...?

457
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,116
It must have shrunk
when my wife washed it!

458
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,286
Why without his costume,
he’s naught but a man!

459
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,204
Hey, screw this.

460
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,873
I’m not gonna let any <i>human</i>
tell me what to do.

461
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,500
That’s right. I am a man.

462
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,669
The man who dressed
like a salamander

463
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,880
to win back his daughter’s love.

464
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,756
Let’s meet her now.

465
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,844
Uh, well, my son is here, too.

466
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,679
Let’s meet him now.

467
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,222
BART:
Here’s... Bart!

468
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,020
Whassup?

469
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,396
(sing-songy):
Boring!

470
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,231
We’re sick of you
and your hatchlings!

471
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,401
(all booing)

472
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,153
Please, stop throwing fruit!

473
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,362
Oh!

474
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,864
(woozy whimper)

475
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,115
(thudding)

476
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,950
KENT BROCKMAN:
Our exit polls show

477
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,328
no candidate attained the
five percent necessary to win,

478
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,705
and Mayor Joe Quimby
will keep his job,

479
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,457
which I didn’t want anyway.

480
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,709
Your loss, jackasses.

481
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,712
(groaning)

482
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,177
Well, Dad, you tried

483
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,970
to make this town
a better place,

484
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,723
and no matter what,
that makes you my hero.

485
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,976
Aw, thanks.

486
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,354
Now how about a dance
with your daddy?

487
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,856
(Blue Danube Waltz plays)

488
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,446
I can’t believe I lost

489
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:42,157
after Ben Affleck campaigned
day and night for me.

490
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,576
LISA:
Yeah, I warned
you about that.

491
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,453
Oop! Be careful of my tail.

492
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,121
You don’t have a tail anymore.

493
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,707
I know. I... I still feel it.

494
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,000
Ooh!

495
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,460
It’s so itchy!

496
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:57,464
(Homer groaning and mumbling)

497
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,764
Shh!
