Come on, Broncos,
you can do it.

18
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,691
And I’m joined
in the broadcast booth

19
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,277
by the stars of ABC’s
latest reality show,

20
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,321
<i>Billionaire Versus Bear.</i>

21
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,865
Let’s review the easy-to-follow
rules of your show.

22
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,242
Each of you thought
you were in a race

23
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,453
to plant the Taco Bell flag
at the North Pole.

24
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,248
What you didn’t know is,
the race was a chase,

25
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,209
spiced up by the presence
of the Betrayer.

26
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,670
(groaning)

27
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,131
Well, now, the bear
has a surprise for you.

28
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,423
He’s not really a bear,

29
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,842
he’s a tiger!

30
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:14,717
Ho! Lookie there!

31
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,678
Denver just won the ballgame!

32
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,515
Oh, the Broncos won?

33
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:24,435
Why didn’t I bet on them
like Professor Pigskin
told me to?

34
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,937
Who’s Professor Pigskin?

35
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,356
He’s a pig who can predict
football winners

36
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,983
in advance!

37
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,526
How is <i>that </i>possible?

38
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,112
Because he’s got something
no gambler’s ever had:

39
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,488
a system!

40
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,032
I’ve gotten the pamphlet
four weeks in a row,

41
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,284
and every time,
the pick-of-the-week

42
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,535
has been right on the money.

43
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,912
Ah... I get it.

44
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,956
Every week,
they send out two pamphlets,

45
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,167
half picking one team and half
picking the other.

46
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,002
Eventually,
there’s a small group of people

47
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,837
who only receive
the correct predictions

48
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,423
and think Professor Pigskin
is always right.

49
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,216
That’s when they ask
for your money.

50
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,885
(gasps): I have money!

51
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,970
Dad, it’s a scam!

52
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:02,807
A scam?! Not according
to Eddie F. from Tucson,

53
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,810
or Football Millionaire
in Beloit, Michigan.

54
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,438
Look, all I’m saying is,
you really should think
twice before...

Expiration date: 06/08.

56
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,028
Oh, Professor Pigskin told me

57
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,697
to bet on the Raiders,
but they look awful!

Now, you have a good day.

64
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,297
Dad, how much money
did you bet?

65
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,466
Hey, I didn’t bet
any of <i>our </i>money.

66
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,718
I just borrowed
some from him.

67
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:43,890
Don’t worry,
we can hammer out
a payment plan.

68
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:47,227
Ow! Ow! It’s not my fault
the Raiders lost!

69
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,145
It’s Professor Pigskin’s!

70
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,023
If he mentions
that pig again, use <i>two </i>hammers.

71
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,609
But the pig... Ow! Ow!

72
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,403
Now, I do have a way
we could settle this debt.

73
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,240
We would like to use your home
to shoot an adult film.

74
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,242
Yeah, it’s called
<i>Lemony Lick-it:</i>

75
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,577
<i>A Series of Horny Events.</i>
(gasps):

76
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,246
Marge would kill me!

77
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,249
Please! There’s got to be
something else I can do.

78
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,584
Like mow your lawn
every week for two weeks.

79
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,169
I can’t do it next week.

80
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,796
Ow-ha-ow! All right!

81
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,715
You can shoot your gay
adult film at my house.

82
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,259
I didn’t say anything
about <i>gay.</i>

83
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,302
I thought you guys
were the Gay Mafia.

84
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,220
Ow!

85
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,638
HOMER:
Oh, they’re shooting

86
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,473
an adult film
at my house tomorrow.

87
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,226
How am I gonna get rid
of Marge and the kids?

88
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,895
Well, I got these
free tickets to Santa’s Village.

89
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,439
I know a guy
who turns the dead
sleigh horses into jerky

90
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,149
and sells it to bars.

91
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,943
Ew...

92
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,320
Thanks, Moe!

93
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,407
Why would we want
to go to Santa’s Village?

94
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,283
It’s August.

95
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,410
<i>I </i>want to see Santa--
he can explain

96
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:46,869
why he gave me
a PlayStation box

97
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,830
with nothing inside
but a coloring book.

98
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,873
It got your hopes up,
didn’t it?

99
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,835
Uh, Homer,
before I take the kids,

100
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,421
I want you to swear
you’re not up to something.

101
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,881
-I swear.
-And I’d also
like to know

102
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,260
why your hand
is in that cast.

103
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,054
Because you look
even more beautiful now

104
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,265
than the day I married you.

105
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,266
Oh...

106
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,273
-(flies buzzing)
-Welcome to Santa’s Village,

107
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,899
where it’s Christmas
every day.

108
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,568
Closed on Christmas.

109
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,155
Those reindeer look
really uncomfortable.

110
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,241
That’s because they don’t
thrive in this environment!

111
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,576
Watcha reading, Santa?

112
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,244
Tom Clancy’s <i>Op-Center.</i>

113
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,079
You don’t seem
very jolly.

114
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,957
Well, Santa
got some bad medical news.

115
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,503
Okay... okay...

116
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,380
And... action!

117
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,800
We’ve been on this spaceship
for a hundred years.

118
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,762
When will we ever
get to Planet Satisfaction?

119
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,889
Hey, Homer, we...
Whoa!

120
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,516
Angela Dare!
Sultry Stevens!

121
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,770
Yeah, what is this,
a reunion of <i>Fahrenheit 9 on 1?</i>

122
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,271
Guys! Get out of here!

123
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,316
Homer, how’d you ever get Marge
to go along with this?

124
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,817
Look, if you promise
never to tell her,

125
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,902
I’ll let you be in the movie.

126
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,696
We just came over
to borrow a board game,
but okay.

127
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,282
I’ve always dreamed
of working in
an adult film.

128
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,492
I’ll run the sound board!

129
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,995
And I’ll perform
in the sex scenes!

130
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:17,293
Merry Christmas!
I’m your old pal
Frosty the Snowman!

131
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,753
In your dreams.

132
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,296
Frosty!

133
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,340
Where’s your magic top hat?

134
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:26,135
Oh, God, please don’t tell Mr.
Roselli I lost my hat again!

135
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,430
(whistling)

136
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,183
My Christmas present
to myself this year

137
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,268
was leaving
that place early.

138
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,353
Mom...

139
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,980
I got a rash
where the reindeer licked me.

140
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,065
Hah?

141
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,775
When they put Santa
in the ambulance,

142
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,403
why’d they pull the blanket
all the way up over his head?

143
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,822
Now, look, I know this
wasn’t the greatest outing,

144
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,324
but your father meant well,
so don’t let him know

145
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,826
that we didn’t... Aah!

146
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,414
Are you guys
almost done?

147
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:58,668
Listen, uh, I got
a tattoo of Foghorn Leghorn
on my right thigh.

148
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,337
Are we gonna get into
any trademark or copyright
issues here?

149
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,589
’Cause we could put
a Band-Aid on it

150
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,925
and say my character
just got stabbed.

151
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,802
Relax, three guys’ll put their
hands on it, okay?

152
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,555
Now, everybody
is very much in love.

153
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,014
And... action!

154
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,810
Homer! Is this
a snuggle film?

155
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,146
Uh... You’re in
the wrong house, lady!

156
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:22,775
How could you allow this,
in the room where we do
puzzles!

157
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,485
(groans)

158
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,364
Honey, please, just listen
to what I have to say.

159
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,365
All right.

160
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,367
I owed the Mafia money.

161
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,368
Oh!

162
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,202
Where are you going?

163
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,370
Away from you.

164
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,830
-When will you be back?
-I don’t know.

165
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,790
-Who’s going
to watch the kids?
-You are.

166
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,667
Me? But I’m the father!

167
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,502
(tires squeal)

168
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,425
Boy, Homer, I’ve never
see Mom this mad.

169
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,843
Honey, come back!

170
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,471
You didn’t say
bye to the kids!

171
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,388
Bye, Bart.

172
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,599
I love you, Lisa.

173
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,059
Sleep tight, Maggie.

174
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:58,978
Today’s the last day

175
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,647
you can eat the yogurt
in the fridge.

176
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,442
Well, we better go eat
that yogurt.

177
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,697
Kids, I’m sure your mother
will be back soon.

178
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,032
She should be back now.

179
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,408
It’s dinnertime.

180
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,327
Look, we’ve been down
this road before.

181
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,411
I do something stupid,

182
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,622
your mom leaves,
we eat waffles.

183
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,623
We’re out of waffles.

184
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,041
All we got is ketchup.

185
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,044
You mean Homer’s
famous marinara sauce?

186
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,420
No, I mean ketchup.

187
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,883
Where’s your sense
of magic and wonder?!

188
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,093
Come on, Marge.
When are you going to call?

189
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,261
(phone rings)

190
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,472
Huh? Let it ring,
play hard to get.

191
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,932
That’s hard enough!

192
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,642
Oh, my darling, I love you!
Please forgive me!

193
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,476
<i>MOE: Hey, Homer.</i>

194
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,936
Moe, what are you
calling me for?

195
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,480
You told me to call.
You wanted to see
if your phone was working.

196
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,107
But what if Marge tries to call
while I’m talking to you?

197
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,901
Ain’t you got call waiting?

198
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,111
Of course, I have call waiting,
you idiot!

199
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,531
I just never learned
how to use it!

200
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,074
Uh-oh, I might have
broken the phone.

201
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,158
I better call Moe.

202
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,453
Oh, hey, Homer.

203
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,539
Moe, will you get off
the line?!

204
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,377
(sighs)

205
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,342
(gasps)

206
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,053
(resignedly):
I guess I better tell them
I’m coming home.

207
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,433
-(snoring)
-(phone rings)

208
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,353
Uh, oh, Marge,
what a pleasant surprise.

209
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,981
I’m at a rest stop
south of Springfield.

210
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,733
I know. You’re sorry now.

211
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,485
Then you’ll buy me
some Quickie Mart flowers,

212
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,112
maybe a box of candy,

213
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:35,283
where half the pieces
mysteriously have testing bites,

214
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,202
and a week later you’ll be back
to your old thoughtless self.

215
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:42,331
No, no, it’s not going
to be like that, I swear.

216
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,334
Ew, lemon cream.
You’re going
in the Marge pile.

217
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,504
I mean, I love you so much.

218
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,548
Yeah, I love you, too.

219
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,757
(loud banging)

220
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,509
Hold on.
I’ll be off in a minute.

221
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,136
(guttural honking)

222
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,763
Listen, buster, I had to buy
a club soda I didn’t want

223
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,765
to get change for this phone.
(gasps)

224
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,475
An oogly-boogly!

225
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,562
(roaring)

226
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,273
Be still.
Don’t give it the phone.

227
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,650
Settle down, Sugar Plum.

228
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,235
Look what Daddy’s
got in his pocket.

229
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,029
Yummy, yummy kelp.

230
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,327
Good girl, yes, yes.

231
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,579
This animal
means you no harm.

232
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,914
She’s a sweet old Florida
manatee,

233
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,542
also known
as a sea cow or dugong.

234
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,920
<i>Hello, Marge,</i>
<i>where do we keep the socks</i>
<i>that don’t smell like feet?</i>

235
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,631
I’ll call you back.

236
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,509
I’m Dr. Caleb Thorn,

237
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,595
and I would do anything
to protect a manatee

238
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,597
except harm
another manatee.

239
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,599
What if by harming
a manatee

240
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,143
you could save
two manatees?

241
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,354
But before you answer,
consider this:

242
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,357
the manatee you have
to harm is pregnant.

243
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,902
Those are the questions
that keep me up at night.

244
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,280
(groaning)

245
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,660
I see a manatee
that needs a hug.

246
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:04,997
Ooh...

247
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,376
<i>Hello, Marge?</i>
<i>Does the pizza guy</i>
<i>take a check?</i>

248
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,503
<i>If so, where do</i>
<i>we keep the checks?</i>

249
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,213
<i>And lastly, how do you</i>
<i>write a check?</i>

250
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,172
Oh!

251
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,633
I think the worst part

252
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,344
was when I realized
that Homer lied to me.

253
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,638
From what you’ve told me,

254
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,723
it sounds like
what your husband
did is nothing new.

255
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,517
Exactly.

256
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,060
I have a saying
which goes,

257
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,853
"You can’t teach a manatee
any tricks."

258
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,355
Maybe you could just
put a hat on him

259
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,272
and say it’s a trick.

260
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,818
My point is Homer is the exact
same man you married,

261
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,611
and if there’s a problem here,

262
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,238
it’s that you keep
expecting him to change.

263
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,322
Huh.

264
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,615
<i>He cares so much</i>

265
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,701
<i>about those doggone dugongs.</i>

266
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,619
<i>I wish I felt</i>
<i>that kind of passion.</i>

267
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,038
<i>Maybe I should join him</i>
<i>on his mission.</i>

268
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,248
Hey, lady blue,

269
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,125
while you’re sitting
there staring at the ceiling,

270
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,626
you boyfriend’s
in the parking lot

271
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,420
with his hands
in a walrus.

272
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,634
Yeah, that’ll be good
for business.

273
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,304
Got to find your mom.
Got to find your mom.

274
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,889
BART: Dad, I promise
I’ll be good.

275
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,391
Can I get out
of the dog carrier?

276
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,684
It was hard enough
getting you in there.

277
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,185
I’m not letting you out.

278
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,146
Yeah, she came through here.

279
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,356
I believe she was looking

280
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,108
to rekindle her
passion for life.

281
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,067
Ain’t that right, Victor?

282
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,069
Oh, yes.
Señora left for the coast

283
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,863
with a rugged,
yet sensitive man of science.

284
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,490
Rugged?
Is that the same as handsome?

285
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,491
Oh, no, no.

286
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,076
"Handsome" means
he look at himself

287
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,286
in the mirror all day.

288
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,496
"Rugged"
means you look at him.

289
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,251
Oh...!

290
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,132
Okay, water monsters,
be friendly...

291
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,633
but not too friendly.

292
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,138
What do I do?

293
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,141
Talk to it!
Let it know
you’re not a threat.

294
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:52,646
Oh, okay. You know, up close
you’re kinda cute.

295
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,064
(retching)

296
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,108
Oh, you’re a good thing.
I know it.

297
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,528
Let me clean out
your ears.

298
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,115
(soft groaning)

299
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,576
I’ve bonded with him!

300
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,620
(laughs)
Whoa!

301
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,625
Where is he taking me?

302
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,502
To his underwater palace.
Just kidding.

303
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,128
It’s a lagoon
full of bugs.

304
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,172
(Marge screaming)

305
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,889
Dad, I don’t think
we’re going to find Mom today.

306
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,016
And I’m sick of eating
at restaurant chains

307
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:32,937
I’ve never even heard of like
Skobo’s and Dim Willie’s.

308
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,396
(Bart groans)

309
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,106
Okay, kids,
we’ll stop for the day.

310
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,484
I have cousins near here.
We’ll stay with them.

311
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,361
Country cousins?
Are they rubes?

312
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,779
’Cause I don’t cotton
to rubes.

313
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,532
Oh, the rubiest.
Ooh, look,

314
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,075
a new restaurant chain.
Whoo-hoo!

315
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,369
Can we say it’s my birthday
and get free stuff?

316
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,121
We’ll say it’s all our
birthdays.

317
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,374
(muttering):
I cannot believe it.

318
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,088
Cousin Homer,
how are you?

319
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,090
And this must be
Bart and Lisa.

320
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,842
Well, aren’t you
nice-looking kids.

321
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,969
Hey, do you folks
want to see a quilt

322
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,680
that’s been in our family
for five generations?

323
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,266
I warned you
he was an idiot.

324
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,018
(country drawl):
Well, all I need
is some moonshine

325
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,271
and someone playing
the harmonicky

326
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,107
and I’m as happy
as a pig in plop.

327
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,067
We’re having lasagna
and Caesar salad.

328
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,694
Don’t laugh.

329
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,196
They’re doing
the best they can.

330
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,031
(sighs)

331
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,616
So, Homer, how are you?

332
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,120
Oh, just great.
Things couldn’t be better.

333
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,289
And how is our
lovely Marge?

334
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:38,127
She, uh, was killed by
a falling air conditioner.

335
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,379
But that’s terrible!

336
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,590
It wasn’t all bad.

337
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,925
As part of the settlement,
her funeral was air conditioned.

338
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,513
Now if you’ll
excuse me,

339
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,098
I have to use
the outhouse again.

340
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,642
Well, we don’t have
an outhouse.

341
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,519
My recording studio!

342
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,815
So how are we related again?

343
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,191
Our dogs are brothers.

344
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,568
BART: Oh, yeah.

345
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,654
I see Mom!

346
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,531
(laughing)

347
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,117
I’ve got my groove back!

348
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,453
We’ve got to tell Dad!
Where is he?

349
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,166
(clucking)

350
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,919
Oh! You lost
that first game to hustle me!

351
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,503
(clucking)

352
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:28,218
I can’t believe how many
manatees we saved today.

353
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,346
And the ones we can’t save,
we put to good use.

354
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,477
(moaning)

355
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,481
What am I supposed to do,
bury them at Arlington?

356
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,942
HOMER: Marge?

357
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,193
Homer?

358
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,569
These are for you.

359
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,654
Ooh...

360
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,448
Listen, I thought about
what I did.

361
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,034
And it was really,
really wrong.

362
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,327
I’m sorry.

363
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,829
Homie, I accept your apology.

364
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,457
I love you, Marge.

365
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,084
But I’m not coming
back yet.

366
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,335
Wha...?!

367
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,336
I’ve found a place

368
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,379
where I’m needed.

369
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,588
You’re needed at home!

370
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,548
And treated like
I deserve.

371
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,343
You’re needed at home!

372
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,261
I’m sorry, Homie.

373
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,889
I just can’t find it
in my heart to come back
right now.

374
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,058
Well,
that’s very reasonable.

375
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,101
You stole my wife!

376
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,143
I’ll kill you!

377
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,980
Homer, I have no interest
in stealing your wife,

378
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,024
but Marge is getting something
from her work with me.

379
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,694
Something a strong,
passionate woman like her needs:

380
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,903
a purpose.

381
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,488
Wow.

382
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,198
I can see
why she loves you.

383
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,700
She doesn’t love me.

384
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,368
She’s just trying
to find herself.

385
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,370
(sighing):
You know everything.

386
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,579
I don’t know everything.

387
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,580
I’m just a man.

388
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,915
And what a man!

389
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,213
Okay, the key to this
thing is the manatees.

390
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,631
Is Marge saving them
or killing them?

391
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,632
Saving!

392
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,217
Okay. To save the manatees,

393
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,469
I guess I could donate my time
and money

394
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,597
and help build them a...
eh, screw that.

395
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,684
Dad!
Those jet skiers are headed
right for a herd of manatees!

396
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,273
Check out those gentle,
exotic sea creatures.

397
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,859
Let’s whomp ’em!

398
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,485
(thuds)

399
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,905
(men laughing)

400
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,491
Oh, man, I just wish
we could see their tears.

401
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,785
(panting)

402
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,370
Why don’t you pick
on someone your own size?

403
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,497
They are roughly our size.

404
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,583
In fact,
they’re bigger than us.

405
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,669
Look, if it were up to me,
I’d be harassing them
with you.

406
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,130
If anything, I’d be the guy
who took it too far.

407
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,424
But I love my wife
and I want to win her back!

408
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,759
You’re a brave man.

409
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,927
And we respect
two things: bravery

410
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,096
and tattoos
that look like barbed wire.

411
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,014
Let’s go.

412
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,351
(laughing)

413
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,352
Rubes!

414
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,856
What did you call us?

415
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,940
Catch me if you can!

416
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,994
(moans)

417
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,537
Manatees-- defend!

418
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,336
(yelling and groaning)

419
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,672
(gasps)

420
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,176
(Homer sobbing)

421
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,598
Attention jet skiers.

422
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,517
I have a court order here

423
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,520
requiring you
to vacate these waters.

424
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,397
No court order’s gonna
tell me what to do.

425
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,191
Oh, man--it’s notarized!

426
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,484
Let’s boogie!

427
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,114
Homer, are you okay?

428
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,740
How many fingers
am I holding up?

429
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,617
Poor dumb country mouse.

430
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,327
Can’t even count.

431
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,662
(groans)

432
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,038
(groaning)

433
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,249
Oh, my sweet,
sweet Homie!

434
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,918
You sacrificed yourself
for the manatees.

435
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,294
(moans)

436
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,587
Rubes...

437
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,631
So many rubes...

438
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,008
pounding me
with their jet skis...

439
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,093
Rubes.

440
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,637
Please, no, rubes.

441
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:05,060
(groaning)

442
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,105
I’m gonna take you home
and fix you up,

443
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,066
’cause you’re the real
endangered species--

444
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,735
a devoted husband.

445
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,700
Marge, I’m always
amazed you chose me.

446
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,243
And I always will.

447
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,578
Woo-hoo!

448
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,500
(sighs)

449
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,502
I’m starting to think
I should find a woman.

450
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,504
-(barking)
-Yeah, Miranda was nice,

451
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,131
but I’m not driving
to Corpus Christi

452
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,549
every time she needs
a light bulb changed.

453
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,759
-(sad barking)
-Amen.

454
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,553
Hey, since we got
the kids with us,

455
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,554
why don’t we all take

456
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,764
a few days
of much-needed R & R?

457
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,350
-Don’t you have to be
back at work?
-Yes.

458
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,520
But I’ve got a friend
who owes me a solid.

459
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,568
Smithers, who is this
barrel-chested go-getter?

460
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,032
I believe it’s a manatee
posing as Homer Simpson, sir.

461
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,534
Oh, that’s cute.

462
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,120
I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

463
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,121
Actually, sir,

464
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,748
I believe he’s about
to die of dehydration.

465
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,749
Good heavens!

466
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,334
Grab a sponge, man!
