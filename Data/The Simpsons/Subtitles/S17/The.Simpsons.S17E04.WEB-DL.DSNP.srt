<i>The highlight so far--</i>
<i>a cloud shaped like a giraffe</i>

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,343
<i>that floated by during</i>
<i>the rain delay.</i>

4
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,886
<i>Oh, would you look at that,</i>

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,473

00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:19,019

8

<i>No doubt complaining</i>
<i>about the good life.</i>

9
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,943
This is the most boring game
in all the universe.

10
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,362
And with all the steroids
they take,

11
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,156
the players look like freaks.

12
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,241
-Freaks! Freaks!
-Freaks! Freaks!

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,702

17
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,378
<i>Mmm-mmm.</i>

18
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,213
If we don’t
speed up this game,

Speaking of which,

22
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,013
we must remember
to get Dorothy something.

23
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,348
-(chuckling lasciviously)
-Oh, yeah.

24
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,856
The boredom is excruciating.

25

28
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,997

<i>Oh, who would’ve thunk it?</i>

30
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,626
It’s still boring.
Faster!

31
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,420
But the fabric of the universe
itself my shatter.

32
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:31,049

For 35 cents off, I love it!

41
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,939
Hey, Lis, I bet I could jump
in the swimming pool from here.

42
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,525
Bart, that would be
the stupidest thing
you ever did.

43
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,903
No. The stupidest thing
would be doing it backwards.

Remember how you wished
we would never grow up?

49
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,503
I’m afraid your son
is in a deep, deep coma

50
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,088
from which he will
never emerge.

51
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,756
I guess we should
count our blessings

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,133
he’s not dead.

53
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,969
Don’t I know it-- this way,
I get to keep billing you.

54

(weeps)

59
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,150
Now, Marge,
if you miss your boy

60
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,528
that much, you could
replace him with one of these.

61
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,322
A robot?

62
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,116
Wow. A robot kid would be
a blast.

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,619
We can confuse him
and make his head explode.

64
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,537
(affecting robot voice):
This statement is a lie.

65
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,956
But if it’s a lie,
then it must be true.

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,877
But if it’s true,
then it must be--
whoop, whoop, whoop! Kaboom!

67
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,213
And a robot
would take your mind off
your dead son.

68
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,298
I thought he was in a coma!

69
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,758
They’re pretty much
the same thing.

70
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,593
except this way,
I get to keep billing you.

71
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,844
You already said that.

72
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,388
Well, you didn’t laugh
the first time.

73
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,271
Okay. Your robot son
is good to go.

74
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,522
You want me
to boot him up?

75
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,649
Okay.

76
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,942
Yah!

78
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,570
Oh.

79
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,739
He knows how to push
all my buttons.

80
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,408
And here’s
how to push his.

81
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,452
Now, I’m a man who likes
to strangle his kids.

82
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,495
Do you think I could...

83
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,913
Sure,
let him have it.

84
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:07,914

90

Having a robot
brother troubles me.

96

are really tensing me up.

Uh-oh.

107
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,308

you process fond
memories of us.

00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,901
we all power down
for the night.

180
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,153

181
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,739
Can I stay
with you guys tonight?

182
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,823
Of course.

183
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,617
And, maybe someday,
you will teach us...

184
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,618
to love.

185
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,036
Yeah, maybe.

186
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,037
What did you used to do?

187
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,580
I was a lawnmower.

188
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,332
I could cut grass
at three different heights--

189
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,374
but I could not love.

190
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,626
I get it, I get it.

191
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,044
Sucks to be you.
Good night.

192
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,837

197

We’ve been harvested!

198
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,058
My servos are gone.

199
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,476

You wanted

211

we’re a family again.

219
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,723
This stinks!

220
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,267
I got stubby little robot legs,

221
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,519
and an ass that’s not equipped
for an adult diet.

You’re not a robot!

228

You’re just possessed

Mm...

232
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,996
I’ll call work and tell

Now,

previously claimed,

288

killing people
is part of your religion...

289

00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,816
(groans)

362
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,777
Outfoxed ’em with
the corpse of my best friend.

363
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,279
Hee-hee!

364
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,280
(shrieks)

365
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,281
(shouts)

366
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,283
(gun clicks)

367
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,076
Is there room
in the head bag, Smithers?

368
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,496
I can make room.

369
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,498
Excellent.

370
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,835
(clanging)

371
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,506
Done and done!

372
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,674
Marge!

373
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,050
You saved me.

374
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,051
(shouts): D-ohh!

375
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,428
What was that for?

376
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:51,056
Staying out 18 hours
and not calling home once.

377
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,058
Aw, I can’t stay mad at you

378
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,353
when that pan smells
like sausage and onions.

379
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,981
And I am glad you’re okay.

380
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,066
(both moaning)

381
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,739
All right,
and there you have it!

382
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,700
Terry Bradshaw, your thoughts
on what just transpired?

383
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,327
Well,
it’s a disgrace, Roger.

384
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,704
This network will show
a dozen gruesome murders,

385
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,539
but I bet they cut
to commercial

386
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,083
before these two begin
the tender act of love.

387
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,502
(moaning)

388
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,504
I spoke too soon, huh?

389
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,505
There they go!

390
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,591
Whoa!
That’s goin’ in my playbook!

391
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,859
Oh, everyone’s wearing
such an interesting costume.

392
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,277
Look! Grandpa’s a gorilla,

393
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,073
Sideshow Mel is Spider-man,
and Nelson’s a raccoon.

394
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,700
I’m not a raccoon.
I’m the Lone Ranger.

395
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,869
I’m too poor
to afford the hat.

396
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,287
That’s not even a mask.

397
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,664
It’s axle grease.

398
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,415
Don’t listen to him,
Silver.

399
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,751
(imitates horse whinnying
and hooves clopping)

400
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,295
And now the finalists
for Best Costume.

401
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,755
First, we have Blackula.

402
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,341
Oh, because I’m black
and I’m Dracula,

403
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,385
that makes me Blackula?

404
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,762
(sputters lips):
My wife said don’t go
as Dracula,

405
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,556
but I said, "Bernice,
we live in the 21st century..."

406
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,558
Send him the standard
racist remark apology.

407
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,476
They’re in the middle drawer.

408
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,936
Our other finalist

409
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,437
is this hideous witch.

410
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,314
(cackling)

411
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,528
(crowd cheering)

412
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,321
Congratulations.

413
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,825
You have won this $25
Kwik-E-Mart certificate.

414
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:36,912
Sucker! 25 bucks won’t buy
you half a Balance Bar.

415
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,581
I exaggerate, but really,
my prices are very high.

416
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,041
Thank you!

417
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,335
Wait! Before you leave,
we’d all like to know

418
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,130
which of our beloved regulars
you are under that costume.

419
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,800
Lindsay Naegle?
Helen Lovejoy?
Old Jewish Man?

420
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:53,178
No, I’m right here,
dressed as my brother Irving.

421
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,305
(sighs):
Every day, I miss him.

422
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,182
(chuckles)

423
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,767
Uh, this is
a little awkward,

424
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,562
because I’m not wearing
a costume.

425
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,980
I’m a real witch.

426
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:03,814
(crowd gasps)

427
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,190
Wait a minute.

428
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,150
That’s cheating!

429
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,653
Burn her...
gift certificate!

430
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,947
Since you are not
technically in costume,

431
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,449
you cannot
win this award.

432
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,160
Rescind my award,
will you?!

433
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,536
You’re all going to pay!

434
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,583
Taint of newt
and scum of pond,

435
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,961
thou shalt become
the guise thou donned.

436
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,297
-(puzzled murmuring)
-Speak English, moron.

437
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,759
I’m turning you
into your costumes.

438
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,010
Well, are you going
to talk about it,

439
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,344
or are you going
to do it?

440
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,184
(groans)

441
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,520
(gasps)

442
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,191
(whinnying)

443
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,821
I’m not a raccoon!
I’m the Lone Ranger!

444
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,824
(groans)

445
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,578
Disco Stu wishes
he’d gone as Marilyn McCoo.

446
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,371
Ooh! Whoo!

447
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,290
Ooh, whoo!

448
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,376
Good luck getting your deposits
back on those costumes!

449
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,213
(horrified gasps)

450
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,716
Seymour, I told you
not to go as G.I. Joe!

451
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,051
Mother, I’m fine.

452
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:17,179
I... Uh-oh.

453
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:21,308
Oh, this isn’t fair.
I wasn’t wearing a costume.

454
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,394
Look at me! I’m a young,
strapping gorilla!

455
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,271
-(thuds)
-(groans)

456
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,023
My hip! It’s shattered!

457
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,858
Somebody help me!

458
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,821
Off we go
to the gorilla hospital.

459
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:38,033
That’s it,
suck out the poison.

460
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,451
Wait a minute.

461
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,537
(Grandpa screaming)

462
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,126
(howling)

463
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,669
(dogs growling)

464
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,672
I am not a happy meal
right now!

465
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,091
I’m telling you,
I’m Oberon,

466
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,300
King of the Fairies.

467
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,094
You’re a big fat bug,

468
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,887
and you’re goin’ down!

469
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,474
(scratching noises)

470
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,934
(grunts)

471
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,310
My spine is not
a scratching post!

472
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,895
(Snowball II yowls)

473
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,522
(with German accent):
Oh, there must be some way

474
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,524
out of this
<i>verdammten </i>spell.

475
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,193
Lisa, do you think
you could check
on your father?

476
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,280
Oh, that’s an excellent
use of a genius brain:

477
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,240
to look after
an idiot head.

478
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,241
(slurps)

479
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,451
(groans)

480
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,452
(slurps)

481
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,871
Oh!

482
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:24,872
(slurps)

483
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,290
No!

484
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,875
(slurps)

485
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,084
Damn it!

486
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,762
(gasps):
That’s the answer!

487
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,348
Maggie’s a real witch now!

488
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,225
She can reverse
the spell!

489
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,435
(growls)

490
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,769
I don’t want
to reverse the spell.

491
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,522
I can howl at the moon
and eat rats.

492
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,483
(howling)

493
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,861
I don’t want to change,
either.

494
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,487
Now I can pull horses
out of the mud.

495
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,531
Then girls will like me!

496
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,325
And I’m Jared
from the Subway ads.

497
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,536
I’m only a little overweight
and sexually ambiguous.

498
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,747
Don’t listen to them,
Maggie.

499
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,081
Maggie?

500
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,959
Please change me back!

501
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,546
This bumblebee has developed
an unhealthy obsession with me.

502
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,965
I don’t want flowers.
I <i>am </i>a flower!

503
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,636
As for Apu-D2,
I could go either way.

504
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,056
(making beeping
and clicking noises)

505
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,266
(discordant pleas shouted
over each other)

506
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,945
( <i>Bewitched</i>
theme music playing)

507
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,574
Oh, well.
This still beats being Moe.

508
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,994
Okay, this concludes
this year’s Halloween show.

509
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,789
We hope you had as much fun
watching our show

510
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,832
as the Koreans
did animating it.

511
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,211
But there’s one group
for whom every day
is Halloween.

512
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,213
I’m talking about
adult illiterates.

513
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,674
For them, trying to read
the morning newspaper

514
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:03,178
is more terrifying
than any goblin, ghoul,
spook or spirit.

515
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,056
So won’t you please donate
a children’s book or something?

516
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,350
Together, we can make
reading a slam dunk.

517
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,686
Dennis Rodman?
What are you doing here?

518
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,645
Working off
a speeding ticket.

519
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,230
Happy Halloween,
everybody!

520
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,611
