I ate all the cookie dough
toppings a man could want.

139
00:06:32,606 --> 00:06:35,575
So many cookies

140
00:06:35,609 --> 00:06:37,644

all that matters is,

141

154

You left some big underpants

155
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:33,965
I didn't know they made
Underoos in size 52.

They're called
Superoos, son.

More like <i>The Expandables.</i>
(chuckles)

159
00:07:42,975 --> 00:07:44,543
Why didn't you
strangle me?

160
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:47,779
That kind of small-scale
violence solves nothing.

161
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:49,281
Couldn't agree more.

162
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:50,882

crusted with Cheeto dust.

164
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:01,526
Uh, I'll pass
on the pork.

165

166
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,334

00:08:09,368 --> 00:08:11,970
Mmm, so slivered.

168
00:08:12,004 --> 00:08:14,005
Mmm.

wished for creeping me out?

170
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,549
I don't know. 'Cause you're

00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:30,956
A napkin.

00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:49,775
Can I just get a glass of water?

180
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:52,277
Water? That stuff killed
my grandmother.

181
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:54,980
So sad.

182
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:01,887
I've been having

183
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:04,156
snuggle dreams.

184
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,159
Marge, I changed in Boise.

185
00:09:07,193 --> 00:09:10,162
I'm not sure a man
who eats right and doesn't drink

186
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:11,563
can be good in bed.

187
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:13,999
Well, what made you...?
You're so beautiful

188
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:17,169
when I cut you off in
the middle of a question.

189
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:19,437
(both moaning)

190
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:22,941
(gasps)
Oh. Oh, my.

191
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:24,743
What's that thing
you're doing?

192
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:27,179
HOMER (sultrily):
Moving my body.

193
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:29,681
MARGE (chuckling):
Oh.

194
00:09:29,715 --> 00:09:33,251
(humming happily)

195
00:09:33,286 --> 00:09:35,887
Don't you think it's weird
that Dad stopped eating pork

196
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:37,322
<i>and</i> drinking beer?

197
00:09:37,356 --> 00:09:38,824
Who cares
what happened?

198
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,358
Daddy's back.

199
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:42,127
(grunts)

200
00:09:43,362 --> 00:09:44,963
(humming happily)

201
00:09:54,106 --> 00:09:56,575
Something happened to Dad
on that trip.

202
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:58,410
This is worse than when he went
to New Orleans

203
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:00,712
and came back
with a Southern accent.

204
00:10:00,746 --> 00:10:03,215
(deep Southern accent):
Uh, how y'all doin'?

205
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:05,417
(crunch)

206
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:08,887
(dog barking in distance)

207
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:11,321
Chief Wiggum, how come every
time there's a terrorist chatter

208
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:13,725
in this town, you come to me?
Lay off, Apu.

209
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,727
When I look at people,
I don't see colors.

210
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:18,630
I just see crackpot religions.
Chief, is there

211
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:21,066
really a terrorist threat
to Springfield?

212
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,469
Yeah. I got
a very important phone call.

213
00:10:24,503 --> 00:10:26,271
(phone rings)
Yello?

214
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:28,106
MAN:
Is this line secure?

215
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,775
Uh, it's a little jiggly
but it'll hold.

216
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,613
We got intel-- uh, that's short
for a word I don't know...

217
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:36,781
Intelligence?
I don't believe so, no.

218
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:40,886
Anyway, this intel says that
someone in town has been turned

219
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,488
and they're working for terrorists.
(gasps)

220
00:10:43,522 --> 00:10:46,391
Now, I got to go check
my other suspects.

221
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:48,226
Uh-huh.

222
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:50,362
But I may be back.

223
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:56,101
Huh?

224
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:59,104
(gasps)
Dad's kneeling on a prayer mat.

225
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:01,773
He doesn't believe in kneeling.

226
00:11:01,807 --> 00:11:05,443
(chanting indistinctly)

227
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:08,513
Huh? It looks like he's praying.

228
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:12,117
To the east. The Middle East.

229
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:13,785
Mecca.

230
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:22,894
(quietly): He's targeting
the nuclear plant.

231
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,668
Meow?

232
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:31,937
If you are a cat, prove it.

233
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:34,940
Do you hate Mondays,
like Garfield? (screeches)

234
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:37,842
And do you love lasagna,
like me?

235
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:39,277
Meow.

236
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:41,346
Okay then.

237
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,714
(humming happily)

238
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:48,887
Mom, I have to tell you
something about Dad,

239
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:50,121
something big!

240
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:53,491
I know. He's changed.

241
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:54,559
Exactly.

242
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:55,794
For the better.

243
00:11:55,828 --> 00:11:57,362
And men don't
change that way.

244
00:11:57,396 --> 00:11:58,069
But-but...

245
00:11:58,094 --> 00:11:59,831
Do you know what
we're doing on Sunday?

246
00:11:59,832 --> 00:12:02,367
Brunch with the Hibberts.
Then the tile store.

247
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:06,771
He's like a husband
in a widow's memory-- perfect.

248
00:12:06,806 --> 00:12:09,407
(grunting)

249
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:11,409
Perfect.

250
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:13,678
Perfect.

251
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:21,586
(beeping)

252
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,922
(phone rings)
FBI.

253
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:26,157
I think someone I love
is a terrorist.

254
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:27,759
Does that make me crazy?

255
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:29,761
No, no. Not at all.

256
00:12:29,795 --> 00:12:32,764
It took me two hours to get
home. Traffic was <i>crazy.</i>

257
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:34,599
Are you people
talking about me?

258
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:36,768
No. We're not even
here right now.

259
00:12:47,813 --> 00:12:49,781
742 Evergreen Terrace.
I'll be right there.

260
00:12:49,815 --> 00:12:51,716
And don't believe what
you've heard about me.

261
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:54,753
I haven't heard anything
about you except from you.

262
00:12:56,455 --> 00:12:59,624
Hanging up
the receiver, eh?

263
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:01,526
(gasps)
How much did you hear?

264
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,861
How much did you say?

265
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:03,928
Nothing, really.

266
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:06,097
So I heard half of nothing.

267
00:13:06,132 --> 00:13:09,134
Dad, you're scary
when you're calm and focused.

268
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:11,870
Lisa, I'll miss you
when this is all over.

269
00:13:11,904 --> 00:13:13,238
When what's all over?

270
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:15,240
This conversation.
(chuckles nervously)

271
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:17,442
See you on the other side.

272
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:18,777
What other side?

273
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:20,712
Of the house.
Where the fireplace is.

274
00:13:20,746 --> 00:13:22,447
We're toasting marshmallows.

275
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:24,215
Marsh...

276
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,451
mallows.

277
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:39,013
I'm Bart Simpson.
Who the hell are you?

278
00:13:39,047 --> 00:13:40,848
Agent Crawford, FBI.

279
00:13:40,882 --> 00:13:43,083
You guys know I don't talk
to field agents.

280
00:13:43,118 --> 00:13:44,919
Get your boss on the phone.

281
00:13:44,953 --> 00:13:47,554
I'm not here for you.
I'm here for your dad.

282
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:49,556
What do you want
with his dad?

283
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:51,191
Go back to
sleep, Milhouse.

284
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:52,593
How do you know my name?

285
00:13:52,627 --> 00:13:55,129
I didn't. But I do now.

286
00:13:56,131 --> 00:13:58,299
Don't talk.
Okay.

287
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,967
I want you to know
I'm the best there is

288
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:01,392
at finding out
what you're up to.

289
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:02,002
Ooh.

290
00:14:02,003 --> 00:14:04,138
I can torture you.
I can give you incredible sex.

291
00:14:04,172 --> 00:14:06,373
Or you can just tell me
what I want to know.

292
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:07,384
What was the
first one again?

293
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:08,409
I see.

294
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,210
You're stupid.
Hey.

295
00:14:10,245 --> 00:14:12,212
I'm the one in bed
with two beautiful women.

296
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:13,213
(gasps)

297
00:14:13,248 --> 00:14:16,150
You think
I'm beautiful? Oh!

298
00:14:16,184 --> 00:14:18,118
In a breaking-and-entering
kind of way.

299
00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:20,120
Well, give me something,
or I'm not leaving.

300
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:21,889
(snoring)

301
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:25,326
Let's just say I've got
to get to work on time.

302
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,729
And if you knew me, you'd know
just how odd that sounds.

303
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:30,597
Who are you
talking to?

304
00:14:30,632 --> 00:14:32,166
No one.

305
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,302
You're in too deep, Annie.
Get out.

306
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:37,304
Are you real, or my imagination?

307
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:39,707
Either way,
my advice is sound.

308
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:43,944
I love my job.

I don't know what horrors
you saw in Boise,

333
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:55,916
but it's not worth
blowing up everyone you love.

334
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,418
I'm not blowing up the plant.

335
00:15:57,452 --> 00:15:58,819

355
00:16:56,411 --> 00:16:59,613
and it's only the end
of the first verse!

356
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,882
LISA:
<i>But I saw you praying to Mecca.</i>

357
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,785
Lisa, I've never prayed
to a city in my life,

358
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:07,721
and if I did, it would be
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

359
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:10,824
I was kneeling on the
affirmation rug they gave me.

360
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:13,594
See?

361
00:17:13,628 --> 00:17:15,162
(rhythmically): Ow, this rug is hard
on my knees.

362
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:16,597
Ow, this rug is
hard on my knees.

363
00:17:16,631 --> 00:17:17,965
Ow, this rug is hard
on my knees.

364
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:20,434
But wait, wait, wait.
What is this?

365
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:22,736
Lisa, the most horrible truth
of all is,

366
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,440
the plant where I work poisons
our water and our air.

367
00:17:26,474 --> 00:17:28,742
I've told you that
a million times.

368
00:17:28,776 --> 00:17:32,446
Aw, sweetie, you told me a
thousand things a million times.

369
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,182
Even with a brain
the size of a dinosaur's,

370
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:36,950
I couldn't take that in.

371
00:17:36,985 --> 00:17:38,752
Anyhoo, this canister

372
00:17:38,786 --> 00:17:41,822
is full of spoiled milk
and utility-grade chicken,

373
00:17:41,856 --> 00:17:44,458
both sold to me by Apu
this morning.

374
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:45,826
When I release it

375
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,594
into the AC system,

376
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:49,930
it'll stink up
the plant forever.

377
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:53,100
No one can use it,
but no one gets hurt.

378
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:55,836
Just like
when I smell up the toilet.

379
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,837
(knocking)
(gasps) Huh?

380
00:17:56,871 --> 00:17:58,839
(grunting)

381
00:17:58,873 --> 00:17:59,840
(door opens)

382
00:17:59,874 --> 00:18:00,841
There he is.

383
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,709
Use your fattest handcuffs.

384
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:04,511
Hey. Uh, it's not
what you think, Lou.

385
00:18:04,546 --> 00:18:05,646
Lou, Lou, Lou.

386
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,647
(ululating):
Lou-Lou-Lou-Lou-Lou...!

387
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:08,015
(groans)

388
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:10,117
I can complete my dad's mission

389
00:18:10,151 --> 00:18:12,719
just like George W. Bush.

390
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:15,522
I can't shoot a little girl.

391
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:17,124
(gunshot)
Ah, damn it!

392
00:18:17,158 --> 00:18:18,692
There's some things
they just don't teach you

393
00:18:18,726 --> 00:18:22,262
in the police academy... movies.

394
00:18:23,331 --> 00:18:25,632
(distorted grunting)

395
00:18:29,737 --> 00:18:30,704
(electronic trilling)

396
00:18:30,738 --> 00:18:32,172
(rhythmic chugging)

397
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,509
We did it, Dad. We did it.

398
00:18:35,543 --> 00:18:36,877
We sure did.

399
00:18:36,911 --> 00:18:37,878
(grunts)

400
00:18:37,912 --> 00:18:40,180
You weren't shot.

401
00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:42,916
No, I was just up late
watching a movie.

402
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:45,719
Something with
William Holden and...

403
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:47,054
(snoring)

404
00:18:51,926 --> 00:18:53,894
Your plan failed.

405
00:18:53,928 --> 00:18:55,249
Thank God this
plant has never had

406
00:18:55,263 --> 00:18:56,663
a functioning
air conditioner.

407
00:18:56,698 --> 00:18:58,365
Wait a minute, Burns.

408
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:00,167
You don't have a functioning
AC system at a nuclear plant?

409
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:01,568
That's against the law.

410
00:19:01,603 --> 00:19:03,203
That's impossible.

411
00:19:03,238 --> 00:19:05,005
Smithers, didn't we move
this plant to China?

412
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,406
Sir, that's two years from now,

413
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:07,908
and you're not supposed
to tell anyone.

414
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:08,976
Oopsie.

415
00:19:10,712 --> 00:19:13,113
There isn't a prison made
that can hold me.

416
00:19:13,147 --> 00:19:15,282
Prisons are still made
of mud and wattles, right?

417
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:18,919
No. Concrete.
(gasps loudly)

418
00:19:18,953 --> 00:19:21,255
You know, Dad, just because
your mission's complete,

419
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:24,291
it doesn't mean you have
to go back to pork eating

420
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:26,727
and beer... drinking.

421
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:28,862
A beer from the sky!

422
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:31,265
It's a sign!

423
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:32,699
(laughing)

424
00:19:34,068 --> 00:19:36,036
Yeah, this equipment will pay
for itself

425
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,671
in one night of binging.

426
00:19:40,808 --> 00:19:44,611
I wish a mission could bring me
closer to someone, but it can't.

427
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:47,748
Okay, it's time for me
to walk alone into the sunset.

428
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:50,384
(gulps loudly)

429
00:19:50,418 --> 00:19:51,985
That's better.

430
00:19:57,158 --> 00:19:59,593
(groans)

431
00:20:13,232 --> 00:20:16,234
Amazingly, the hamster's
older than I am.

433
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:03,904
Shh!
