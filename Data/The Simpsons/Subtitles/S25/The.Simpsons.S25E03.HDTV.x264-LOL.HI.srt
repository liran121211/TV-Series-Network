00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:52,592
Picasso.

180
00:08:53,394 --> 00:08:55,161
Matador Juan Belmonte.

181
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,531
And Stalin.

182
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:00,633
That man could really
put pressure on you.

183
00:09:00,668 --> 00:09:01,901
Hello, Kent.

184
00:09:01,936 --> 00:09:04,370
Well, well, well.
Rachel Maddow.

185
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:06,406
Everyone came back
for Chip's funeral.

186
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,975
I was flying from DC to New York
and, of course,

187
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:10,343
I had the layover
in Springfield.

188
00:09:10,377 --> 00:09:12,078
How's the gang at Channel 6?

189
00:09:12,113 --> 00:09:14,347
Look, let's get this out of the way--
just because we both

190
00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:16,549
worked at Channel 6 and
you made it big and I didn't

191
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:19,385
doesn't mean I'm bitter.
Um, Is that your car?

192
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,154
Maybe.

193
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:22,589
Kent, I'm
gonna tell you

194
00:09:22,623 --> 00:09:25,158
the most important
mistake you ever made...

195
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:26,693
after this break.

196
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:28,995
So, Kent, that
mistake you made,

197
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:30,997
that fundamental,
life-changing error,

198
00:09:31,031 --> 00:09:32,699
that cosmic fail, that...

199
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:35,168
Just tell me already!
After this break.

200
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:36,669
You could have
come with me,

201
00:09:36,704 --> 00:09:38,404
but you were suckling
the dual teats

202
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:41,608
of infotainment
and celebrifawning.

203
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:43,543
(upbeat theme plays)

204
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:45,578
So, tell us about
your new movie.

205
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:47,113
It's fantastic.

206
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:50,250
The studio let us play
in their sandbox.

207
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:52,752
Great. We have a clip.
No! No, don't show it.

208
00:09:52,786 --> 00:09:55,388
There aren't five good seconds
in the whole film.

209
00:09:55,422 --> 00:09:56,789
(car door closes,
tires screeching)

210
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,860
I'm not a newsman anymore,
I'm a geologist.

211
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:02,896
I keep discovering
a new rock bottom.

212
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,798
Kent, I think I found my
ticket out of this town.

213
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,967
Or at least to a
<i>better</i> Springfield.

214
00:10:08,002 --> 00:10:10,069
You two newshounds
working on a story?

215
00:10:10,104 --> 00:10:11,871
How about this?

216
00:10:11,906 --> 00:10:14,908
Mario's down the street
found a rat in their pasta.

217
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:16,476
When did that happen?

218
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,478
Whenever you want. Eh?

219
00:10:18,512 --> 00:10:19,913
Rachel, can I come?

220
00:10:19,947 --> 00:10:21,314
We can share blazers.

221
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:22,882
Just follow me.

222
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:25,418
At Mario's, the picture
of Sinatra on the wall

223
00:10:25,452 --> 00:10:27,453
is signed by Frank Junior.

224
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:29,622
The frame hides the "Junior"!

225
00:10:29,657 --> 00:10:32,625
Someone's been dumping tires
in the forest.

226
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:36,396
Willikers!
In my three years of soft news,

227
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,997
I've never seen
anything like this.

228
00:10:38,032 --> 00:10:41,467
Those are tires from my
ill-fated Krusty Town Car.

229
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:44,504
It would <i>explode</i> if people
gripped the wheel too tightly.

230
00:10:44,538 --> 00:10:46,072
(laughs):
What a scoop!

231
00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:47,674
You're not telling no one.

232
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,743
As the 4:00 p.m. clown,
I have complete control

233
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:53,046
of the Channel 6 news division.

234
00:10:54,682 --> 00:10:56,516
Local news is a joke.

235
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,151
I'm going to cable.

236
00:10:58,185 --> 00:10:59,586
Cable news!

237
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,288
Bah! People only want news
at 6:00 p.m.

238
00:11:02,323 --> 00:11:04,123
from white guys on weekdays

239
00:11:04,158 --> 00:11:05,992
and black guys on weekends.

240
00:11:06,026 --> 00:11:07,293
We'll see about that.

241
00:11:07,328 --> 00:11:09,128
Yes, we shall see.

242
00:11:09,163 --> 00:11:11,464
About that,
things will be seen.

243
00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:13,499
By us.

244
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:15,868
Kent, you coming?

245
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:17,337
He ain't comin'.

246
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:19,505
This little piggy's
afraid to leave his cushy

247
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,474
anchorman slop trough.

248
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:23,943
Could you, uh, phrase that
a little more nicely?

249
00:11:23,978 --> 00:11:26,713
Sorry. He "isn't" coming.

250
00:11:26,747 --> 00:11:28,281
You'll regret this, Kent.

251
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:30,683
When I have my own show
and you're stuck here

252
00:11:30,718 --> 00:11:33,219
tracking Santa's flight
from the North Pole.

253
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:35,255
"Oh, look, he's
over Greenland!"

254
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,428
Don't worry, piggy,
you made the right choice.

255
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:47,934
Eh, it'll burn out
in an hour or so.

256
00:11:53,707 --> 00:11:54,107
Grunting as he lifts
Bryce in the air.

257
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:57,557
Look, Burns, I've got the dope
on your sweetie.

258
00:11:57,657 --> 00:11:59,625
She's still alive,
and she just got over

259
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,426
being mad at you last week.

260
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:02,961
Lilah's alive?

261
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:04,496
Yeah, well, uh,
she's alive,

262
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,465
<i>but</i> she's a nun.

263
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:08,800
Married to Jesus, eh?
Does he beat her?

264
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:11,303
Jesus? No, he's a real
Eagle Scout, that one.

265
00:12:11,337 --> 00:12:14,239
But your penguin's not a Catholic,
she's a Buddhist nun--

266
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:17,742
spent her life expressing her
sexuality with a Zen garden.

267
00:12:17,777 --> 00:12:19,644

into a flying killer robot

353
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:26,274
that I control
with my mind. Amen.

354
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:27,442
That's not a prayer.

355
00:16:27,476 --> 00:16:29,143
My God says it is.

356
00:16:33,482 --> 00:16:36,684
Oh, I see you're ice-cold
with anticipation.

357
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,921
Dead?

358
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:41,456
Oh, Lilah.

359
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,292
Even at the end,
I waited too long.

360
00:16:44,326 --> 00:16:46,661
What if I give her
the breath of life?

361
00:16:46,695 --> 00:16:48,129
(soft exhale)

362
00:16:48,163 --> 00:16:49,530
Oh, boy.

363
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:51,599
I guess one regret
just leads to another.

364
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:53,835
You know, sir, maybe it
would bring you peace

365
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:56,404
to honor the one thing
Lilah ever asked of you.

366
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:01,109
Here you are, my good man.

367
00:17:01,143 --> 00:17:03,444
A little broth will cure
your mental illness. (chuckles)

368
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:04,812
Sir, that's
five minutes.

369
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:06,881
You can stop thinking
of other people now.

370
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,851
You know what, I think
I'll give it another five.

371
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:14,289
I'm proud of you, Monty.

372
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:15,623
(kissing)

373
00:17:15,658 --> 00:17:17,358
I ain't
eatin' that.

374
00:17:20,596 --> 00:17:23,031
Chief, what are you
doing to save our son?

375
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:25,033
Well, I've placed marksmen
on the roof

376
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:27,001
to shoot the balloons
one by one,

377
00:17:27,036 --> 00:17:28,870
but frankly
they're not very good.

378
00:17:28,904 --> 00:17:30,138
(gunshot)
(grunts)

379
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:32,373
(whining): Chief,
it happened again.

380
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:34,809
Aw, come on, guys,
spread out. Arm's length.

381
00:17:34,843 --> 00:17:36,244
It's all my fault.

382
00:17:36,278 --> 00:17:37,879
I should never have listened

383
00:17:37,913 --> 00:17:40,548
to those KISS albums
when I was pregnant.

384
00:17:40,582 --> 00:17:42,984
Marge, with all due respect,
that's ridiculous.

385
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:45,420
My Sarah listened to Mozart
and Churchill speeches

386
00:17:45,454 --> 00:17:47,088
when she was pregnant
with Ralphie,

387
00:17:47,122 --> 00:17:49,390
and he can't even
open a refrigerator.

388
00:17:49,425 --> 00:17:51,092
Pushing, always...
always pushing.

389
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:52,260
Really?

390
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:54,028
Oh, yeah.
That kid's a mess.

391
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:56,397
Hey! Only <i>I</i> get
to criticize him, Lou.

392
00:17:56,432 --> 00:17:58,866
Kid's scared to flush.
Think's it's his brother.

393
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:02,103
Can we focus on my
son up in the sky?

394
00:18:02,137 --> 00:18:03,771
Oh, I've got
a long-shot idea.

395
00:18:03,806 --> 00:18:07,775
By which I mean firing a shot
over a long distance.

396
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,544
(chuckling)

397
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:11,179
Yeah, you see, if we could fire

398
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:15,249
an exactly 12-and-a-half-pound
weight into the basket,

399
00:18:15,284 --> 00:18:18,553
it would lower the boy
very gently to the ground.

400
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:22,023
Unfortunately, all our
cannonballs were melted down

401
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:24,859
to make a statue
of Joe Paterno,

402
00:18:24,893 --> 00:18:27,495
which we changed
to look like Eugene Levy.

403
00:18:29,264 --> 00:18:32,633
I think I just might have
what you're looking for.

404
00:18:32,668 --> 00:18:36,437
♪

405
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:40,208
Today I'm <i>glad</i> that
I sold that stock.

406
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:42,944
Uh, Apple closed up
another 20 points today.

407
00:18:42,978 --> 00:18:44,879
(whining):
Why does everyone know?

408
00:18:44,913 --> 00:18:47,415
Because their terrific products
keep track of it for you.

409
00:18:47,449 --> 00:18:49,484
And anything else
you could ever think of.

410
00:18:56,258 --> 00:18:58,559
That kid's not
dying on <i>my</i> watch.

411
00:18:58,594 --> 00:19:00,762
Which ends... right
now, fortunately.

412
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:02,430

413
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:06,834

Hey.

416
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:13,975
CROWD: Bart! Bart!
Hmm. (yells)

417
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:16,244
Homer's rising faster
than Apple stock.

418

420
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:22,583
My boy's okay!

00:19:22,618 --> 00:19:24,252
CROWD (chanting):
Bart! Bart! Bart!

422
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:26,154
I won the
science fair!

423
00:19:26,188 --> 00:19:28,089
I get to go to Chicago!

00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:32,827
Ugh. Bart, Bart, Bart.

426
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:34,862
You know what I think
about regrets?

427
00:19:34,897 --> 00:19:37,432
As long as your family
is together,

428
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:40,435
every choice you've ever made
is the right one.

429
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:42,203
And together we are.

430
00:19:42,237 --> 00:19:43,938
(gunshot)

431
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:46,707
Would you guys knock it off?
He's down safe already.

432
00:19:46,742 --> 00:19:47,932
(gunshot)

433
00:19:47,957 --> 00:19:50,078
MAN: Sorry, Chief,
that was me putting it down.

434
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,380
And there you have it--
a family reunited.

435
00:19:52,414 --> 00:19:55,383
And a grateful nation gives
thanks for some solid reporting.

436
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:56,951
Back to you, Rachel Maddow.

437
00:19:56,985 --> 00:19:58,986
Great job, Kent.
I think we might have

438
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:00,688
an opening for you at MSNBC

439
00:20:00,722 --> 00:20:02,657
between our weekend
prison documentary block

440
00:20:02,691 --> 00:20:04,625
and the two hours it takes

441
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,694
to make up Joe Scarborough
on Monday morning.

442
00:20:06,728 --> 00:20:08,663
(chuckles): No, thanks, Rachel Maddow.
I'm happy right here.

443
00:20:08,697 --> 00:20:11,065
No regrets.

Shh!
