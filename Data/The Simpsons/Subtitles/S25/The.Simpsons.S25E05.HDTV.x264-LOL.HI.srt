Come on.
Just pick one.

Hmph!

22
00:01:34,985 --> 00:01:37,287
Did you know some historians
think American football

23
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:39,556
is based on
an ancient Aztec game?

24
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,225
It's not American football,
it's just football.

25
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:44,427
Bart, you're not annoyed
that Milhouse asked me

26
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:47,497
to go to the American football
game instead of you?

27
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:50,099
Mom, Lisa's ruining football.
American football.

28
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:53,503
No time for breakfast, Marge.
Just give me a banana.

00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:55,538
(humming)

30
00:01:57,308 --> 00:01:59,776
Now, listen. I have
to work late tonight.

31
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:06,583
Again? I was hoping you could
spend some time with the kids.

32
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:09,819
It's a tough economy.
Money doesn't grow on trees.

33
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:12,689
It grows on threes.

34
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:14,290
(laughs)

35
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:15,358
Yeah, I'm out.

36
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:16,359
Me, too.

37
00:02:16,393 --> 00:02:17,760
Too rich for my blood.

38
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:19,496
I should not have
anted with my blood.

39
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:21,865
Whew.

40
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:23,500
You got the touch

42
00:02:26,337 --> 00:02:28,638

I'd better

I don't want to take

00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:53,463
Hmm.

55
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:57,300
Who's president now,
Alexander Hamilton?

Timing the elevators, eh?
Oh.

60
00:03:06,677 --> 00:03:08,144
Smart.
Oh.

61
00:03:08,178 --> 00:03:09,579
No, no.

62
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:11,347
I'm timing
my contractions.

63
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:12,749
I think
I'm in labor.

64
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:14,484

66
00:03:17,154 --> 00:03:18,688
What the...? Oh!

67
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:20,857
Do you have a cell phone?

68
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:23,726
Everyone has a cell phone.
Mine's at home.

69
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:26,896
The most beautiful moment
of my life is happening <i>now.</i>

70
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:30,500
Everything will be fine.

71
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:33,069
Um...Oh you, uh,
you like movies?

72
00:03:33,103 --> 00:03:35,057
This reminds me of
that scene in <i>Alien.</i>

73
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:35,972
What?

74
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:38,908
The scene where she escapes
with the cat at the end.

75
00:03:38,943 --> 00:03:40,743
Aw, well, that's sweet.

76
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:43,413
Listen, I'm glad I'm not
going through this alone.

77
00:03:43,447 --> 00:03:45,415
I haven't seen
my boyfriend in months.

78
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:48,551
Oh, uh, he was just here.

79
00:03:48,586 --> 00:03:49,919
No, he wasn't.

80
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:51,120
But thanks for lying.

81
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:52,922
You like lies?
Here's a few:

82
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:55,725
College is expensive
but it's worth it.

83
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,360
I think the baby's coming.

84
00:03:57,394 --> 00:03:59,729
Okay Homer, remember
your Lamaze training.

85
00:03:59,763 --> 00:04:02,599
Now, this next
position is fantastic

86
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:05,702
for women who are
carrying especially big.

87
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:07,470
Homer, can you demonstrate?

88
00:04:07,504 --> 00:04:09,105
Mm-hmm.

89
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:10,373
Mm...

90
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:13,876
Oh. Yeah, wow,
that does feel good.

91
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:15,378
Oh, no, I think
it's coming.

92
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:17,747
Oh, I haven't even
picked a name yet.

93
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:20,049
You did this to me.

94
00:04:20,084 --> 00:04:21,050
No, I didn't.

95
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:22,485
I'm talking to the baby.

96
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,887
Here it comes.

97
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:27,090
Um, I don't know
how to tell you this,

98
00:04:27,124 --> 00:04:30,126
but your baby doesn't have any legs.
What?

99
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,327
Oh, wait, there's more.

100
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:32,495

102
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:35,331

103
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:37,133
And he's uncut.

104
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,668
Very Euro.

105
00:04:38,702 --> 00:04:40,303
Now, hug your mommy.

106
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:43,272

107
00:04:43,307 --> 00:04:45,742
inspected in August 2009,

108
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:47,377

to share this moment

112
00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:53,916
with someone who cared.

113
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:56,653
Yeah, that guy didn't
even look over once.

114
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:58,554

How was work?

117
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:05,628
Miraculous.

118
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,663
Mm?

119
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:09,165
Mothers are so awesome.

120

of a junior Atomette.

129

They're picking me, Dad.

130
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:41,664
Don't call me "Dad." If
people think peanut vendors

131
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,332

I'm kind of pessimistic
about the team's chances.

136
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:57,880

get creamed.

No... problem.

Great job,

cover your parking.

gonna do about it?

Good game, everyone.
I never dreamed

a night where you
discovered I was cheating

161

I had your
jacket cleaned.

166

Good as new.

we didn't need

181
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:56,301
and, uh, well, here's some
diapers Maggie's too big for,

182
00:07:56,336 --> 00:08:01,039
and an <i>incredible</i> educational
toy I forgot to give Bart.

183
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:04,409

babysit for an hour?

for Homer Jr.,

218

a baby I delivered
in an elevator

219
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,634
the night I pretended
to go to work

220
00:09:35,668 --> 00:09:36,968
but was really playing poker.

221
00:09:37,003 --> 00:09:38,236
What?!

222
00:09:38,271 --> 00:09:40,105
(grunting)

223
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:42,307
This simulation has been brought
to you by your brain,

224
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:44,242
a subsidiary of your penis.

225
00:09:44,277 --> 00:09:48,246
Oh, yes, I'm shopping
for Maggie, our baby together,

226
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:50,148
so this looks
perfectly innocent.

227
00:09:50,183 --> 00:09:51,950
Why are you saying that?

228
00:09:51,984 --> 00:09:54,186
Oh, you know how
the first few weeks are:

229
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,922
sleep deprived,
walking around in a fog.

230
00:09:56,956 --> 00:09:59,091
First few weeks
of what?

231
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,492
Um, November.

232
00:10:00,526 --> 00:10:01,927
(groans)

233
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:03,662
(grunting, low chatter)

234
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:05,430
Hey, Atomette.

235
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:07,199
I want to say... Caitlin?

236
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:09,101
Lisa. Guys, do you realize

237
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:11,036
you're being exploited
by this team?

238
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,838
ALL:
Wha...?

239
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:14,439
They sell your posters,

240
00:10:14,474 --> 00:10:15,607
workout DVDs,

241
00:10:15,641 --> 00:10:16,775
and all of your practices

242
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:18,410
are broadcast on a webcam.

243
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,784
And some of the angles

244
00:10:25,818 --> 00:10:28,120
are low.

245
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:30,021
But don't worry,
collective bargaining

246
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:32,290
will enable us
to secure concessions.

247
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:36,528
Uh, we're gonna push 'em back,

248
00:10:36,562 --> 00:10:39,464
push 'em back,
push 'em way, way back.

249
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:41,199
All the way to a new contract.

250
00:10:41,234 --> 00:10:43,168
'Cause union power is a fact.

251
00:10:43,202 --> 00:10:44,870
And we're...

252
00:10:44,904 --> 00:10:46,338
Okay, okay, we get it.

253
00:10:46,372 --> 00:10:48,306
Well, look who's here.

254
00:10:48,341 --> 00:10:51,309
You been hit by the cheerleading
bug, little lady?

255
00:10:51,344 --> 00:10:55,046
Actually, I've been hit by
the unfair labor practices bug.

256
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:58,350
What? Why, that's
Samuel Gompers talk.

257
00:10:58,384 --> 00:11:02,053
Now, little missy, the only
thing you should be organizin'

258
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:03,555
is your dollies.

259
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:06,892
How? By size, brand, value?

260
00:11:06,926 --> 00:11:09,227
And don't even suggest race,
'cause I don't see that.

261
00:11:09,262 --> 00:11:11,062
I just see little people I own.

262
00:11:11,097 --> 00:11:12,330
What do you say, ladies?

263
00:11:12,365 --> 00:11:14,065
(indistinct whispering)

264
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,067
Not right, not fair.

265
00:11:16,102 --> 00:11:18,136
Let's say it with our hair.

266
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:24,543
Okay, fine.

267
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:26,211
I'm gonna give it some thought,

268
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:29,080
then say no
in the nicest way possible.

269
00:11:29,115 --> 00:11:31,116
No.

270
00:11:35,888 --> 00:11:38,023
Oh, good.

271
00:11:38,057 --> 00:11:39,724
Nice.

272
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,126
"Beat Dallas."

273
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,762
Can never argue
with that.

274
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:48,233
Hey, ladies. My vest isn't
the only thing that's ripped.

275
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:50,769
I am in the market
for a backup mistress.

276
00:11:50,803 --> 00:11:52,137
Possibly two.

277
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:54,039
Have you kids
seen your father?

278
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:57,142
Surprised he's not here
ogling these girls.

279
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:58,643
He said he was going to work.

280
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:00,612
On a Friday afternoon?

281
00:12:00,646 --> 00:12:03,448
(gasps) I bet he's
playing poker again.

282
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:04,549
Coming through.

283
00:12:04,584 --> 00:12:06,117
Wife on a mission.

284
00:12:06,152 --> 00:12:07,619
Go, fight, win.

285
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:08,753
Marge.

286
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:12,991
Wow, I've never burst
through a banner before,

287
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:15,193
but it really does the trick.

288
00:12:15,228 --> 00:12:16,428
(pounding on door)

289
00:12:16,462 --> 00:12:18,897
Homer, I know you're here.

290
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:20,499
Your car's outside.

291
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,267
Where is he?

292
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:23,935
I honestly
don't know.

293
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,972
I'm just teaching myself massage
here with online videos

294
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:28,106
and a store mannequin.

295
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,176
Oh, I'm so sorry.

296
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,512
So, do you have any injuries
I should know about?

297
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:34,746
Oh!

298
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,148
Hmm, if he's not in there,
where is he?

299
00:12:37,183 --> 00:12:38,850
HOMER:
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

300
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:41,353
<i>Oh, baby, shake it.</i>
<i>Homer like.</i>

301
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:43,755
(gasps)
Oh.

302
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:46,424
Shake it. Now, roll
over on your tummy,

303
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:47,759
just like I
taught you.

304
00:12:47,793 --> 00:12:49,928
<i>Tell me what</i>
<i>a cow says.</i>

305
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:51,429
(toy moos)

306
00:12:51,464 --> 00:12:53,498
Aah!
My other baby mama.

307
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,667
So this is where
you've been going.

308
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:58,169
Another woman's
apartment.

309
00:12:58,204 --> 00:13:00,005
Marge, it's not
what you think.

310
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,940
Quiet. You're
upsetting Homer Jr.

311
00:13:01,974 --> 00:13:04,442
(quietly):
You have a baby together?

312
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:05,677
Oh, it's cool.

313
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:07,479
We did it in an elevator.

314
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:10,181
(gasps)
I'm a Schwarzenegger wife.

315
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:13,151
But you're also the housekeeper,
so it's all good.

316
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:14,219
It's not good.

317
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:15,720
None of it's good.

318
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:17,689
I haven't had a
drink for a week.

319
00:13:17,723 --> 00:13:19,124
That is pretty good.

320
00:13:22,397 --> 00:13:24,918
So then you
delivered her baby

321
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:27,721
right there  in the elevator.
It's true.

322
00:13:27,755 --> 00:13:30,223
Even the other guy
in the elevator-- he's right here.

323
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:32,592
And the really funny
thing is I'm a doctor.

324
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:36,329
Well, I'm glad
you did a good deed,

325
00:13:36,364 --> 00:13:38,265
but you shouldn't
come here again.

326
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:40,800
I thought that was
strange poop on your collar.

327
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:42,168
(moans sadly)

328
00:13:42,203 --> 00:13:43,670
Good-bye, Homer Jr.

329
00:13:43,704 --> 00:13:45,772
I guess you're the
man of the house now.

330
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:47,073
And never forget,

331
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:49,409
even though the mortgage
is due on the first,

332
00:13:49,443 --> 00:13:52,345
you can usually wait
till the 17th.

333
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,081
(sobbing)

334
00:13:55,116 --> 00:13:57,284
You know what?

335
00:13:57,318 --> 00:14:00,353
I think it's fine
if Homer spends a few hours

336
00:14:00,388 --> 00:14:01,921
now and then with...

337
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:03,790
Homer Jr.

338
00:14:03,824 --> 00:14:05,191
Exactly.

339
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:07,327

charity begins at home.

340
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:08,795
But not which home.

341
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:11,798

00:14:58,746 --> 00:15:02,349
Oh, man, I really
overdid it tonight.

359
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:03,850
Late night at Moe's, eh?

360
00:15:03,884 --> 00:15:05,752
No, I'm exhausted from

It's the toes.

364
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:13,226
What about your
own children?

365
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,096
Way ahead of you, Marge,
I'm taking all four

366
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,031
of my kids to the zoo tomorrow.

367
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:19,232
<i>Three.</i>

368
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:20,567
Yes, we'll be back by 3:00.

369
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:22,435
Homer has a very
tight nap schedule.

370
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,704
Quit talking
about that baby.

371
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:27,273
I was talking about myself
in the third person.

372
00:15:27,308 --> 00:15:28,842
Oh.

373
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,678
We can't take
much more of this, Lisa.

374
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:34,581
The girls are getting so antsy
they'll cheer anything.

375
00:15:34,615 --> 00:15:36,950
You're the greatest generation,

376
00:15:36,984 --> 00:15:39,519
worthy of our veneration.

377
00:15:39,553 --> 00:15:42,021
Go Grampa!

378
00:15:42,056 --> 00:15:45,792
If this is heaven,
why don't my shoes match?

379
00:15:45,826 --> 00:15:47,861
(doorbell rings)

380
00:15:47,895 --> 00:15:50,764
(deep sigh)
Okay, I give up.

381
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:54,100
I'm gonna do what
we secretly did at the Alamo--

382
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:55,402
surrender.

383
00:15:55,436 --> 00:15:56,803
(cheering)

384
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:59,072
While you're at it,
how about a little boost

385
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:00,573
for peanut vendors?

386
00:16:00,608 --> 00:16:03,910
What do you think
I'm taking their raise out of?

387
00:16:07,681 --> 00:16:10,483
(jabbering happily)

388
00:16:10,518 --> 00:16:12,285
I wanted you all
to be happy together,

389
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:13,753
so I brought you
to the zoo

390
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:16,656
where all the animals
live in harmony.

391
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:20,326
(growls)

392
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:22,061
(triumphant wail)

393
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:24,130
Okay, guys,
I got your ice creams.

394
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:29,002
Hey, ah, ah, ah.

395
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:31,938
Now, Maggie, we don't
hurt each other in this family.

396
00:16:31,972 --> 00:16:33,573
Are you nuts?

397
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:35,508
You can't even kiss me good
night without slicing me

398
00:16:35,543 --> 00:16:37,477
with your stubble.
Why you little...

399
00:16:37,511 --> 00:16:39,579
I'll give you a good-night kiss
you'll never forget.

400
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:40,814
Come here, you.

401
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:42,549
(grunting)
Aah, ooh, ah!

402
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,984
Ah! Ow!
Yeah!

403
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:49,355
Dad, we're missing the giant
capybaras of Uruguay.

404
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:54,494
Okay, I know what'll
cheer you kids up.

405
00:16:54,528 --> 00:16:57,096
Seeing me out-monkey
the monkeys.

406
00:16:57,965 --> 00:16:59,966
(hooting like a monkey)

407
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,001
(angry hooting, screeching)

408
00:17:02,036 --> 00:17:04,370
I have a soul
and you guys don't.

409
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:05,472
(hooting)

410
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:07,373
Aah! Monkeys!

411
00:17:09,343 --> 00:17:10,677
(grunts)

412
00:17:10,711 --> 00:17:12,779
(angry grunt)

413
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:20,053
Dad, Maggie's rolling away.

414
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:22,188
(gasps) She's heading for
Prairie Dog Village.

415
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:23,690
If they get her
in their warrens,

416
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:25,425
we'll never
see her again.

417
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:26,960
(chittering)

418
00:17:26,994 --> 00:17:28,628
Look, shiny keys.

419
00:17:28,662 --> 00:17:29,696
Jingle jangle.

420
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,232
(grunts, laughs)
Stupid monkeys.

421
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:40,373
That's it, Maggie,
use the Dino-Wand.

422
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:52,986
This is the last time
you'll see that elevator baby.

423
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,655
I'm sorry,
Homer Jr.

424
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:58,558
You'll occupy an idealized
place in my heart

425
00:17:58,592 --> 00:18:01,861
that no one can
ever quite fill.

426
00:18:01,896 --> 00:18:04,764
(Homer sobbing)

427
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:07,901
Therapy, please.
Me, too.

428
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:10,169
Okay, I've got to impart
all my fatherly advice

429
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:11,704
in this one walk.

430
00:18:11,739 --> 00:18:14,841
The sky is blue,
but nobody really knows why.

431
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,543
Don't believe
what they tell you.

432
00:18:16,577 --> 00:18:18,611
Girls are great and terrible
at the same time.

433
00:18:18,646 --> 00:18:20,079
Get used to it.

434
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:22,382
And, most importantly...
Oops, we're here.

435
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,551
You'll have to figure
it out on your own.

436
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:28,454
Sorry, little fella.
One day I'll be that guy

437
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:31,024
who comes to your wedding,
makes you feel a little weird,

438
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:32,458
and then runs away.

439
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:33,760
Homer, great news.

440
00:18:33,794 --> 00:18:35,194
Chase came back.

441
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:36,963
(whoops)
Who's Chase?

442
00:18:36,997 --> 00:18:38,431
Homer Jr.'s father.

443
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:41,568
Oh, my God,
is that my son?

444
00:18:41,602 --> 00:18:43,036
You didn't tell me
he was a soldier.

445
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,971
You didn't tell <i>me</i>
you were pregnant.

446
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:47,140
I didn't want you to marry me
because I was pregnant.

447
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:49,409
I wanted you to marry me
because I was nagging you.

448
00:18:49,443 --> 00:18:50,977
(fusses)

449
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:53,746
Um, he likes it if
you tickle his toes.

450
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:55,548
Dude, he's my kid.
He likes what I like.

451
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,250
But n-n-n-nurture.

452
00:18:57,284 --> 00:18:59,452
Gretch, I think
he's got my calves.

453
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:01,254
He does, baby,
he does.

454
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:03,590
Can I just say
good-bye to him quick?

455
00:19:03,624 --> 00:19:04,591
Sure.

456
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,392
I guess this is it, little guy.

457
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:07,357
Da-da.

458
00:19:07,382 --> 00:19:10,421
(gasps) The most beautiful
words a father can hear.

459
00:19:10,464 --> 00:19:13,499
Da-da. Da-da.
Oh.

460
00:19:13,534 --> 00:19:15,768
Hey, one day you'll have
kids of your own.

461
00:19:15,803 --> 00:19:16,812
I do.

462
00:19:16,837 --> 00:19:19,512
Really? Then this is
much creepier than I thought.

463
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,974
Much.

464
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:24,611
Shouldn't have bet his door
if he didn't want to lose it.

465
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:26,613
(sighs)

466
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,488
Hi, Maggie.
If you could talk,

467
00:19:35,522 --> 00:19:38,558
I know you'd have a few
choice words for me.

468
00:19:40,394 --> 00:19:43,763
You want me to take care
of your dolly?

469
00:19:43,797 --> 00:19:47,533
That's the sweetest thing
any baby has ever done for me.

470
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,203
Honey, you know where
the bottle opener is?

471
00:20:02,238 --> 00:20:03,738
I think it's
in the drawer.

472
00:20:05,174 --> 00:20:06,708
Whoa, little dude.

473
00:20:06,742 --> 00:20:07,943
Where did you
learn that?

474
00:20:12,715 --> 00:20:16,051
This is what we're
fighting for, babe.

475
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:17,819
(marching band playing
theme song )

476
00:20:17,853 --> 00:20:19,955
HOMER: <i>Hey, what's this marching band</i>
<i>have to do with Homer Jr.?</i>

477
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:21,423
<i>What?!</i>

478
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:24,392
<i>There were cheerleaders in our</i>
<i>house and nobody told me?</i>

479
00:20:24,427 --> 00:20:26,394
