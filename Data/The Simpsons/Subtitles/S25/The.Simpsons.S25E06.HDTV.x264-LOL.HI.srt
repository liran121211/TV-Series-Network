87
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:16,344
And don't you hate being
the middle child?

88
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:19,380
Yeah. In the car, I always
have to sit on the hump.

89
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:20,681

you dropped by.

96
00:05:33,462 --> 00:05:35,296
Okay, but one more thing:

97
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,931
I noticed we're both
doing presentations

98
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:39,500

Why don't we do them together?

99
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:43,438

Franklin Roosevelt
bravely instituted

107
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:00,988
a series of reforms
called the New Deal.

108
00:06:01,023 --> 00:06:02,423
Which ran totally counter

109
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,826
to America's tradition
of limited government.

110
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,128
P.S. It was also
unconstitutional.

111
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:08,629
Oh?

112
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:11,799

113
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:14,368
also helped America
win World War Two.

114

sold us out at Yalta.

115

179
00:08:36,294 --> 00:08:38,628
People's views change.

180
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:41,064
Bobby Kennedy worked
for Joe McCarthy.

181
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,866
Larry David was on <i>Fridays.</i>

182
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,267
What are you trying to say?

183
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:47,003
Isabel's only eight.
As she grows up,

184
00:08:47,038 --> 00:08:49,773
surprising things will
happen to her body...

185
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:50,907
of beliefs.

186
00:08:50,942 --> 00:08:53,276
But she could always use
a friend like you.

187
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:54,311
Hmm.

188
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,414
Hmm.

189
00:08:57,448 --> 00:08:59,850
Isabel?
Lisa?

190
00:08:59,884 --> 00:09:01,485
Listen, I'm really
sorry about...

191
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,786
No, it's okay.

192
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,088
My mom says you're just
going through a liberal phase.

193
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:08,592
What?! My mom says you're going
through a conservative phase.

194
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:09,693
There's no such thing.

195
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:11,161
Conservatives only get
more conservative.

196
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:12,395
Because every year,

197
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,364
they get a little further
through <i>Atlas Shrugged.</i>

198
00:09:14,398 --> 00:09:16,700
Listen, we're both
eight years old.

199
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:18,768
Can't we just play
Monopoly or something?

200
00:09:18,803 --> 00:09:20,904
My father owns
a monopoly!

201
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:25,709
(whirring)

202
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:32,582
That young filly is exactly
the kind of candidate

203
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:34,684
we need to start
recruiting!

204
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,888
She's a young,
dynamic <i>Latina.</i>

205
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:41,291
Yee-haw!
I said that just right!

206
00:09:41,325 --> 00:09:45,228
Without the Hispanic vote, even
Texas is poised to turn blue.

207
00:09:45,263 --> 00:09:46,329
Blue!

208
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:49,299
Yeah, we must reach her
and groom her

209
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,501
before she fattens up
like Chris Christie.

210
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:54,604
He thinks GOP
stands for "Gravy on Pancakes."

211
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,106
(laughter)

212
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,977
But despite my mirthful remarks,
obesity is no laughing matter.

213
00:10:06,502 --> 00:10:10,539
(chuckles) Just can't resist
those words, "sign-up sheet."

214
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:13,708
Oh, looks like I'll be
running against Isabel.

215
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:14,943
And Ralph?

216
00:10:14,977 --> 00:10:16,945
Just call me
Ralph Nader.

217
00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:18,947
I don't know why.
Isabel!

218
00:10:18,981 --> 00:10:21,183
I want this campaign
to be about the issues:

219
00:10:21,217 --> 00:10:22,617
same-sex field trip buddies,

220
00:10:22,652 --> 00:10:25,220
providing class pets
with a path to citizenship...

221
00:10:25,254 --> 00:10:27,088
And no digging up
past relationships.

222
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:30,058
Sure, Lisa and I dated.
Sure, she broke my heart.

223
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:32,227
I'm sure your researchers
know all about it.

224
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:34,196
This is the first
I've heard of it.

225
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,797
Really?
But I got this!

226
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:37,599
Ew.

227
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:40,168
How long has it been since
you washed your stomach?

228
00:10:40,203 --> 00:10:41,803
You can't ask that anymore!

229
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:43,371
(chuckles nervously)

230
00:10:43,406 --> 00:10:44,539
Quit shoving!

231
00:10:44,574 --> 00:10:46,475
I'd like a word
with you, young lady.

232
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:47,609
How did you get in there?

233
00:10:47,643 --> 00:10:48,944
Slid in through
the grates.

234
00:10:50,646 --> 00:10:52,314
Here's the scoop.

235
00:10:52,348 --> 00:10:53,515
You're our future,

236
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:55,250
so we can't afford
to have you lose.

237
00:10:55,284 --> 00:10:56,718
And I love the Spanish--

238
00:10:56,752 --> 00:10:59,588
from the Inquisition
to the delightful Franco years.

239
00:10:59,622 --> 00:11:01,289
What are you talking about?

240
00:11:01,324 --> 00:11:03,625
Move over!
I know how to talk to kids.

241
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:06,061
We want to give you
a little present.

242
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:09,598
A tainted victory
that will haunt you forever.

243
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:12,300
I'd rather
do this myself.

244
00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:14,202
But who'd own you then?

245
00:11:14,237 --> 00:11:17,205
You couldn't buy me with
a wheelbarrow full of ice cream.

246
00:11:20,576 --> 00:11:22,143
Whoa, nicely done.

247
00:11:22,178 --> 00:11:24,779
You've charmed another one
right into the arms

248
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:26,581
of the Libertarian Party.

249
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:29,484
Maybe we can help her without
her knowing we're helping her.

250
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,888
No one says I can't buy
a second grade election.

251
00:11:32,922 --> 00:11:35,357
Why, I had enough money to fix
<i>People Magazine's</i>

252
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:37,292
Sexiest Man Alive.

253
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:38,994
Most of the money
went to convincing them

254
00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:40,428
that I was alive.

255
00:11:42,832 --> 00:11:44,833
Who ordered
the Yumboni?

256
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:46,034
Right here!

257
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:47,936
Now, Smithers,
I want you to eat this for me.

258
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,170
Describe every taste.

259
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:51,172
And don't forget
the brain freeze.

260
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:53,275
Sir, I am lactose-intolerant.

261
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:54,476
And I'm back-talk-allergic!

262
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,677
So start eating!

263
00:11:55,711 --> 00:11:56,711
(groans)

264
00:11:58,147 --> 00:11:59,948
Have a great day, kids.

265
00:11:59,982 --> 00:12:01,816
And, Bart, I'll pick you up
after school

266
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:03,552
to take you to karate lessons.

267
00:12:03,586 --> 00:12:05,520
Mom, after six weeks,
I figured out

268
00:12:05,555 --> 00:12:08,023
that Sensei Weinstein
is really my psychiatrist.

269
00:12:08,057 --> 00:12:11,893
Either way, for 45 minutes,
you're not my problem, sweetie.

270
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:14,195
(horn honking)

271
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,397
(gasps)

272
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:17,599
Don't worry, Lisa,
despite the paid ad,

273
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:19,901
I am strictly middle
of the road.

274
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:21,336
Idiot!
(horns honking)

275
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,370
Pick a lane!

276
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:23,538
(tires screech)

277
00:12:23,573 --> 00:12:25,373
Wha...?!

278
00:12:29,745 --> 00:12:31,746
What are you doing?!

279
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:33,348
I'm as bewildered
as you are.

280
00:12:33,382 --> 00:12:35,350
I don't know why, but the
Springfield Republican Party

281
00:12:35,384 --> 00:12:36,551
is grooming me.

282
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:39,054
Grooming? Yuck!

283
00:12:39,088 --> 00:12:41,089
Unfortunately,
I can't stop it.

284
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:43,792
The Supreme Court says
spending money is free speech.

285
00:12:43,826 --> 00:12:45,627
Well, then you could use
your free speech

286
00:12:45,661 --> 00:12:48,663
to denounce this intrusion
of big money into our election.

287
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:49,931
Mm, I'll think about it

288
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:52,200
while I'm on my listening tour
of the cafeteria.

289
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:01,176
(slurring):
Pour me another.

290
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,744
What are you doing?

291
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:04,212
It's imaginary.

292
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:06,514
Fine.

293
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:07,716
I got to go.

294
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,719
I'll see you later.

295
00:13:12,888 --> 00:13:14,889
(humming a tune)

296
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:23,698
(grunting)

297
00:13:25,434 --> 00:13:27,035
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

298
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:29,404
Bart, I need you to help me
win the election.

299
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:31,406
I can help, but it's
gonna get rough.

300
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
I'm fine with rough.

301
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:34,009
You don't know what rough is.

302
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:35,176
That ain't rough.

303
00:13:35,211 --> 00:13:36,945
More like a gentle breeze.

304
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:38,279
Maggie hits harder.

305
00:13:38,314 --> 00:13:41,650
Did the good night pixie
just kiss my cheek?

306
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:42,651
Ow!

307
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:44,152
Okay, you got my attention.

308
00:13:44,186 --> 00:13:45,587
You want to win this election?

309
00:13:45,621 --> 00:13:47,989
Then from now on,
you do exactly what I say.

310
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:49,124
You got it.

311
00:13:49,158 --> 00:13:50,792
First, go make me
five pans of brownies.

312
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:53,461
You're just taking advantage
of the situation.

313
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:55,497
Hmm, maybe Isabel
likes baking.

314
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:57,399
Cakey or gooey?

315
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:59,634
I'll make both.

316
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:03,238
First, we reel them in.

317
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:05,607
Then, we scare
the hell out of them.

318
00:14:05,641 --> 00:14:07,709
By discussing the
school's budget crisis?

319
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:10,111
No, with balls to the head.

320
00:14:10,146 --> 00:14:12,681
(blows whistle)
Bombardment!

321
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:19,854
I associate Isabel
with a pain in my tummy.

322
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:23,191
Bombardment?

323
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:24,693
(groans)

324
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:25,960
Miss Simpson,

325
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:27,929
your platform calls
for the creation

326
00:14:27,963 --> 00:14:29,597
of a student-run garden.

327
00:14:29,632 --> 00:14:31,866
Organic gardening is
an essential part

328
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:34,769
of 21st century education,
teaching both hands-on...

329
00:14:34,804 --> 00:14:36,438
And what programs
would you cut to pay

330
00:14:36,472 --> 00:14:38,106
for this precious garden
of yours?

331
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,407
The new Wiffle bats?

332
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:40,608
Pizza Friday?

333
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:43,211
(gasps)
Not Pizza Friday!

334
00:14:43,245 --> 00:14:45,113
Sorry, Lisa, you lose again.

335
00:14:45,147 --> 00:14:46,114
(air horn blares)

336
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:48,817
You got to get
on your game, sister.

337
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:49,918
You think I'm tough?

338
00:14:49,952 --> 00:14:52,420
Wait till Gutiérrez
sinks her teeth into you.

339
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:54,222
Remember, you got
an ace in the hole:

340
00:14:54,256 --> 00:14:56,891
chocolate milk
in the water fountains.

341
00:14:56,926 --> 00:14:58,259
That's impossible.

342
00:14:58,294 --> 00:14:59,661
We've already had
the best plumbers

343
00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:01,329
in the city look into it.

344
00:15:01,363 --> 00:15:03,898
Hey, we'll worry about that
after you're elected.

345
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:05,233
(groaning)

346
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:06,568
(whistling)

347
00:15:06,602 --> 00:15:07,902
What are you
so happy about?

348
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:09,270
It's in the bag, Lis.

349
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:11,239
Once everybody sees this.

350
00:15:12,274 --> 00:15:13,374
Training wheels.

351
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:15,310
She still uses
training wheels.

352
00:15:15,344 --> 00:15:16,478
(snickers)

353
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:17,746
And watch this.

354
00:15:20,516 --> 00:15:22,584
(crying)

355
00:15:22,618 --> 00:15:24,119
Excellent.

356
00:15:24,153 --> 00:15:25,620
What am I doing?

357
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:27,355
Untent! Untent!

358
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:31,259
Oh, Bart, I want to win,
but not like this.

359
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:32,927
I'm sorry, you're fired.

360
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:38,533
Leave the bottle.

361
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:41,936
I bet by the end of the night,
you're gonna look pretty good.

362
00:15:41,971 --> 00:15:45,774
Welcome to our first
in a series of 37 debates--

363
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:49,110
good Lord-- before the
elementary school elections.

364
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:50,645
You're a booger head!

365
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:53,414
And I say we move
beyond name-calling

366
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:55,884
to solve our real problems.

367
00:15:55,918 --> 00:15:57,218
(all booing)

368
00:15:57,253 --> 00:15:58,553
Booger head!

369
00:15:58,587 --> 00:16:00,021
Vote for whoever you want to.

370
00:16:00,055 --> 00:16:01,389
To me, these are both losers.

371
00:16:01,423 --> 00:16:05,360
Now, the second grade debate
between Isabel Gutiérrez

372
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:07,796
and Lisa Simp-a-son.

373
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,897
Sounds weird.

374
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:10,565
Mm.

375
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:11,900
ISABEL:
<i>Ivy Agee,</i>

376
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:14,068
Frank Marino, Glen Gloyd.

377
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:16,805
These are men who fought
at Omaha Beach.

378
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:18,239
And they are the reason

379
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:20,408
I'm running
for second grade rep.

380
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:22,577
<i>Dios los bendiga a todos.</i>

381
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:23,878
(students cheering)

382
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:26,948
I'll bet my bologna sandwich
that girl's gonna win.

383
00:16:26,982 --> 00:16:29,050
Oh, a little rich
for my blood, sir.

384
00:16:29,084 --> 00:16:30,752
Yes, you can fog
a mirror, Seymour,

385
00:16:30,786 --> 00:16:32,187
but I wouldn't
call you alive.

386
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:35,123
Now, the other candidate,
Lisa Simpson.

387
00:16:35,157 --> 00:16:37,559
Okay, I'm a liberal.

388
00:16:37,593 --> 00:16:39,761
And sometimes
that's a dirty word.

389
00:16:39,795 --> 00:16:40,762
(laughter)

390
00:16:40,796 --> 00:16:42,063
Liberal.

391
00:16:42,097 --> 00:16:45,099
But what liberal really means
is someone who believes

392
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:46,901
that those who have
more than enough

393
00:16:46,936 --> 00:16:49,404
should share a little
with those who don't.

394
00:16:50,272 --> 00:16:51,506
And those principles

395
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,441
have consistently been in place

396
00:16:53,475 --> 00:16:56,177
during this country's
most prosperous times.

397
00:16:56,212 --> 00:16:59,047
So if that's a liberal,
then I am a liberal.

398
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:00,148
And hang me.

399
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:01,316
(screams)

400
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,117
Sorry, we're just setting up

401
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:05,053
for <i>An Occurrence</i>
<i>at Owl Creek Bridge.</i>

402
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:14,122
(groaning)

403
00:17:14,156 --> 00:17:15,292
Ooh.

404
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:17,194
The Democratic Party pantheon.

405
00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:19,130
Such lofty ideals.

406
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,164
(gasps)

407
00:17:20,198 --> 00:17:21,599
And here come the spirits.

408
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:24,034
Michael Dukakis, Walter Mondale,

409
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,336
John Kerry?

410
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,004
These are all losers!

411
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,107
I'm afraid you're heading
for a loss, Lisa.

412
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:32,676
And when we lose, we lose big.

413
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:33,944
What about Obama?

414
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:35,045
Harry Truman?

415
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,113
Bill Clinton?

416
00:17:36,148 --> 00:17:37,948
Lisa, you're a lot like me.

417
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:39,984
Play the saxophone,
come from a small town,

418
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,619
raised by a mother
with no help.

419
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:43,454
So, do you know how I can win?

420
00:17:43,488 --> 00:17:45,289
I don't even know
why I'm a ghost.

421
00:17:45,323 --> 00:17:46,790
All these guys are alive.

422
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:48,659
John Kerry here is
Secretary of State.

423
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,227
Doing a bang-up job.

424
00:17:50,262 --> 00:17:51,962
Well, we still
have a long way

425
00:17:51,997 --> 00:17:53,931
to go on Asian
currency issues.

426
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:55,499
Absolutely.

427
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:57,214
And, Lisa, I'm only
appearing in this dream

428
00:17:57,235 --> 00:17:59,803
so I can visit with you about
the Clinton Global Initiative.

429
00:17:59,838 --> 00:18:02,573
See, our mission is
to turn ideas into action.

430
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:04,186
And to find innovative
solutions that will hel...

431
00:18:04,211 --> 00:18:04,742
(snoring)

432
00:18:04,743 --> 00:18:05,709
Hey, hey, hey!

433
00:18:05,744 --> 00:18:07,244
You can't fall asleep
in a dream!

434
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,946
(snoring)

435
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,947
(groans)

436
00:18:09,981 --> 00:18:11,248
I know what I've got to do.

437
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,385
Hello, Isabel? Listen...

438
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:15,686
(snores)

439
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,288
(groaning)

440
00:18:17,322 --> 00:18:19,723
CGI also convenes
CGI America,

441
00:18:19,758 --> 00:18:23,360
a meeting devoted to economic
recovery and job creation.

442
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:24,862
You used to be fun!

443
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,530
Kevin Costner used
to be a movie star.

444
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:27,565
Get over it.

445
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,201
And now for their final debate,

446
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,770
please welcome,
uh, Li... um...

447
00:18:32,804 --> 00:18:35,773
Li-sa? Li-sa, uh, Simpsone.

448
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:37,541
Yes.

449
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:41,378
And, uh, Isabel
Adolpho-Guzman-Lopez Gutiérrez.

450
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:42,613
Uh, ladies.

451
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:48,786
(grunts)

452
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,455
I just want to say,
I don't care about politics,

453
00:18:51,489 --> 00:18:54,291
electioneering
or negative campaigning.

454
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:56,860
If my friend Lisa wins,
so be it.

455
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,128
(speaks Spanish)

456
00:18:58,163 --> 00:18:59,763
(cheering)

457
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:02,099
And I also want
to say that if...

458
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:03,200
Time's up.
But I...

459
00:19:03,235 --> 00:19:04,535
Stop showboating.

460
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:06,270
(grunts)

461
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:11,108
Back in the banner shed you go.

462
00:19:11,142 --> 00:19:12,443
SKINNER:
<i>Good morning.</i>

463
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:14,578
We have completed
the tally of the votes

464
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:15,813
for class representative.

465
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:17,815
One brief announcement:
the tainted Greek salad

466
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:19,083
has given several students

467
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,485
nightmares involving
Michael Dukakis.

468
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:23,153
It may recur tonight,
so if possible,

469
00:19:23,188 --> 00:19:25,155
have your parents
strap you to the bed.

470
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,757
And now the results.

471
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,626
First grade rep--
results delayed indefinitely

472
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,261
due to jelly on the ballots.

473
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:31,262
Second grade rep--

474
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,530
Isabel Gutiérrez.
(grunts)

475
00:19:33,565 --> 00:19:35,232
Third grade rep, no votes cast.
Congratulations, Isabel.

476
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:37,268
Fourth grade rep-- last name
Weiner, first name Ima...

477
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,136
I truly hope you enjoy the
Friday morning council meetings.

478
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,437
Simpson!

479
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:43,507
(crying): And the-the free
snicker doodle cookies.

480
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,842
Smithers, we won!

481
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:47,478
Drop the balloons!

482
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:48,846
Ow! Ow! Ooh!

483
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,147


484
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:51,282
(siren blaring)

485
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,317
Can I at least
remove the balloons?

486
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:55,019
Do it and you'll kill him.
(groans)

487
00:19:55,053 --> 00:19:56,954
Hey, Lis.

488
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:57,955
Hey.

489
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,189
I'm sorry I fired you.

490
00:19:59,224 --> 00:20:00,557
Eh, no hard feelings.

491
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:02,459
A lot of good things have
been happening to me.

492
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:03,460
Mm-hmm.

493
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:04,728
Thanks, Bart.

494
00:20:04,763 --> 00:20:06,096
I think you might
feel better

495
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:08,098
if you looked at
these exit polls.

496
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:10,534
They find me
a pointy-haired know-it-all.

497
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:13,470
Yes, but they agreed
with everything you said.

498
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,805
What are you getting at?

499
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,675
53% said they'd vote
for a liberal.

500
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:19,109
Just not you.

501
00:20:19,144 --> 00:20:21,378
Huh. You hear that, world?

502
00:20:21,413 --> 00:20:24,448
They love my ideas,
just not me!

503
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:26,850
And that is half the battle!

504
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:28,319
Ha!

505
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,521
Hello, I'm elder
Anderson Cooper.

506
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:31,922
Welcome to our first debate

507
00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:33,657
between Republican
Isabel Gutiérrez

508
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:35,926
and Lisa Simpson, representing

509
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,529
the Democratic Robot
Zombie Coalition.

510
00:20:38,563 --> 00:20:40,898
First question:
Ms. Simpson, what would you do

511
00:20:40,932 --> 00:20:43,300
to get America
out of Afghanistan?

512
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:46,637
I'd just throw in the towel
and make it a state.

513
00:20:46,671 --> 00:20:48,972
That's our girl.

514
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:50,374
(toots twice)

515
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:55,408
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

516
00:21:34,697 --> 00:21:36,302
Shh!
