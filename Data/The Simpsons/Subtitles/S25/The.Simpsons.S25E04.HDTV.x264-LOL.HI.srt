00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:18,026
(school bell ringing)

00:00:20,863 --> 00:00:21,830
(Barney burps)

4
00:00:21,864 --> 00:00:23,098
(tires screeching)

5
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:26,001
D'oh!

6
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:27,035
(tires screech)

7
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,703
Not again!

8
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:31,606
(classical music playing)

00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:44,341

11
00:01:01,504 --> 00:01:02,837
Now, I, Bart Simpson,

12
00:01:02,872 --> 00:01:05,473
shall send the first coaster
down the track.

13
00:01:05,508 --> 00:01:06,508
Hmm.

14
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:11,146
(Milhouse grunts)

15
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:13,548
(gasping)

16
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:19,721
No, for once,
I want to go first.

17
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:22,657
But, Milhouse, I already
let you push me on the swings.

18
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:25,160
And it's an honor,
but I'm doing this.

19
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:27,062
Ow! Knock it off, Milhouse!

20
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:28,163
(grunting)

21
00:01:28,197 --> 00:01:31,132
(yells)
Eat safety bar!

22
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:33,735
(muffled):
Why are we best friends?

23
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:36,471
Because your seat
was behind mine!

24
00:01:36,505 --> 00:01:37,906
(both grunting)

25
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,941
(groans)

26
00:01:41,243 --> 00:01:43,244
(both crying)

27
00:01:44,513 --> 00:01:47,082
Feels like this playdate's
gone on forever.

28
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:48,416
I'll handle this.

29
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:51,753
"Dear Weirdo,
pick up weirdo kid."

30
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:52,787
And send.

31
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:53,788
Aah!

32
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:55,790
(gasps)
Did you eat a peanut?

33
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:58,026
No, I just sniffed a nectarine.

34
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,327
It's okay.

35
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:01,463
I can breathe
through my tear ducts.

36
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:04,432
(whistling)

37
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:05,967
Tell me if this
gets annoying.

38
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:07,802
(whistling continues)

39
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:11,272
I think I'm gonna throw up
the mac and cheese you fed me.

40
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:12,507
I'm not supposed to have it.

41
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,110
That's why I had so much.

42
00:02:15,144 --> 00:02:16,711
HOMER:
What the...?!

43
00:02:16,746 --> 00:02:19,681
If this kid's dad isn't
here in one second,

44
00:02:19,715 --> 00:02:22,017
he's going in the garbage can.

45
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:23,618
(car honks)

46
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:25,186
Hey, guys!

47
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:27,956
Who wants a whiff
of New Kirk Smell?

48
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,090
"YOLO"?

49
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,892
You Only Live Once.

50
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:33,094
Once again, cats have it better.

51
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:34,562
Kirk Van Houten.

52
00:02:34,597 --> 00:02:37,365
I hope you're not having
a midlife crisis.

53
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,467
Please.
Just 'cause I bought a new car,

54
00:02:39,502 --> 00:02:40,635
lost a little weight

55
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,537
and started taking
a DJ class,

56
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:45,340
everyone thinks
I'm having a midlife crisis.

57
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,442
Dad! You got me
a skateboard?

58
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:48,677
It's for me.

59
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:49,844
Now get in the back.

60
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,012
And while you're there,

61
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:53,281
use this cream to
massage the leather.

62
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:55,817
(leather squeaking)

63
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:58,420
To the tooth-whitening kiosk!

64
00:02:58,454 --> 00:02:59,621
(laughing)

65
00:02:59,655 --> 00:03:03,191
I'm sorry, but does Kirk
know how silly he looks?

66
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,559
Look at me!

67
00:03:04,593 --> 00:03:06,828
I'm afraid of dying.
(laughs)

68
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:08,229
Oh, Homie.

69
00:03:08,264 --> 00:03:09,831
I'm so glad you're happy

70
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:12,600
with your life
just the way it is.

71
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:15,136
You've had the same
job, same car,

72
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:18,039
same house for 20 years.

73
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:20,275
And that's all
you'll ever have.

74
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:22,744
A cycle you'll never ever,

75
00:03:22,778 --> 00:03:24,879
ever, ever, ever,

76
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:26,915
ever change.

77
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:29,384
And you're okay with it!

78
00:03:30,953 --> 00:03:33,555
Like I say night after night

79
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,323
after night...

80
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:37,358
nighty-night.

81
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,062
(birds chirping)

82
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:44,632
Kent Brockman is here
for your interview.

83
00:04:00,483 --> 00:04:02,717
So, Kent, what brings you here?

84
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:05,086
The miraculous tale
of how we lost, then found,

85
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:06,988
our Lost and Found box?

86
00:04:07,022 --> 00:04:08,790
Actually, Principal Skinner,
I'm here to talk

87
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:09,924
about something else...

88
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:10,925
cheating!

89
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,093
(chuckles)

90
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:14,095
I thought this was a puff piece.

91
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,296
You're wearing a sweater.

92
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:17,899
This journalism just turned...

93
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:19,667
gotcha!
(gasps)

94
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:21,836
That's right, Channel 6
will uncover the truth

95
00:04:21,871 --> 00:04:24,506
in a five-part series
two minutes a day.

96
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,108
People, make room for your local
Emmy nomination certificates.

97
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:28,843
No, do not make room.

98
00:04:28,878 --> 00:04:30,378
Except for Mr. Largo
and his diet,

99
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:31,846
there's no cheating
in this school.

100
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:33,181
These 30 identical

101
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:36,117
"What I Did This Summer"
essays say different.

102
00:04:36,152 --> 00:04:37,318
Um...

103
00:04:43,793 --> 00:04:46,294
Myra, don't I have
another appointment?

104
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,963
Oh, this is your first
appointment ever.

105
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:51,065
Let's take a look
at this monitor.

106
00:04:54,603 --> 00:04:57,472
<i>This school is more corrupt</i>
<i>than the Italian parliament.</i>

107
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,973
<i>If these children</i>
<i>are our future,</i>

108
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:02,377
<i>then I, for one,</i>
<i>do not want to live.</i>

109
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:10,318
(quietly):
Ha-ha.

110
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,488
Please don't air this.

111
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,690
I'll tell you the winners of
the kickball games in advance.

112
00:05:15,724 --> 00:05:17,692
You can make a lot of cabbage
betting on K-ball.

113
00:05:17,726 --> 00:05:19,828
And that's what we'll end
the story with.

114
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,629
No!

115
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:22,964
This is Kent Brockman.

116
00:05:22,998 --> 00:05:25,133
Pleased with himself.

117
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,035
♪ You only

118
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:30,405
♪ Live once

119
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,473
♪ Or so it seems

120
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:37,979
♪ No life for yourself

121
00:05:38,013 --> 00:05:42,417
♪ And none for your dreams

122
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:45,753
♪ You work

♪ At a job so lame

125
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,131
♪ And every night

126
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:01,035
♪ The ending's the same.

127
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,239
♪ No dream will come true

♪ Live once.

130
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,079
(deep breath)

131
00:06:11,113 --> 00:06:13,014
(crying to the tune of
"You Only Live Twice")

132
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:19,053
(higher-pitched crying)

133
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:21,890
Yeah, well, at least you
got your health, huh?

134
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:24,092
Now let's see if I can
take that away from you.

135
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:26,661
Your poison.

136
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:29,797
(groans)
I'm tired of living once.

137
00:06:29,832 --> 00:06:31,466
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

138
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,269
but I'm starting to
regret saying "YOLO."

139
00:06:34,303 --> 00:06:36,504
Marge, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna quit complaining

140
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:40,141
about my life and start
wallowing in the past.

141
00:06:40,175 --> 00:06:42,610
Postage, marked in pesetas?

142
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:44,045
Who are those letters from?

143
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,980
My old pen pal from Spain.

144
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,615
Eduardo.
Hmm.

145
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,017
Back in fifth grade,
you either had to write

146
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:50,885
to a foreigner
or a prisoner.

147
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,320
I picked a foreigner
because the prisoners

148
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:54,255
wrote back too fast.

149
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,492
We'd write each other
with our dreams of the future.

150
00:06:57,526 --> 00:06:59,794
I was gonna be
King of Cheeseburger Mountain.

151
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:01,596
(sighs)

152
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,298
Did I change or did they stop

153
00:07:03,332 --> 00:07:05,700
making mountains
out of cheeseburgers?

154
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:08,469
Probably a little bit of both.

155
00:07:08,504 --> 00:07:10,905
So sad.

156
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,643
(indistinct chatter)

157
00:07:15,678 --> 00:07:17,745
(overlapping chatter)

158
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,614
What kind of moral example

159
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,383
is this dump for my boy?

160
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:23,751
(burps)

161
00:07:23,786 --> 00:07:24,953
(crowd clamoring)

162
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,788
Please, calm down, everyone.

163
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,856
You know, maybe
this so-called cheating scandal

164
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:31,292
is actually
an opportunity to, uh...

165
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,128
(clears throat)
...initiate a-a dialogue

166
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:37,298
that would, uh, create
a teachable moment.

167
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:41,202
Uh, something, something
buzz word...

168
00:07:41,236 --> 00:07:43,404
I got nothing.

169
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,373
Quick, get a picture
for the yearbook!

170
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,474
(crowd clamoring)

171
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,943
LISA:
I have a solution!

172
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:52,146
You took your sweet time
coming to our rescue, Lisa.

173
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,182
Maybe the best way to keep
students from cheating

174
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:56,651
is to trust them not to cheat.

175
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,286
(crowd murmuring)

176
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,654
That's it?
That's all you've got?

177
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,856
Something I can read
on a tea box?

178
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,526
What I'm suggesting is
we create an honor code.

179
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:07,962
Oh, swell, more work
for the teachers.

180
00:08:07,997 --> 00:08:09,397
The students would do it.

181
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:10,898
Let her speak!

182
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:13,534
If every student pledges
not to cheat,

183
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:15,937
and to turn in any cheater,

184
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:17,505
no one will cheat the system

185
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,274
because they'll be the system.

186
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:23,878
ALL (chanting):
Honor code! Honor code!

187
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:25,947
I did it.

188
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:27,315
I saved the day.

189
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:29,684
The same way I won
that battle in Vietnam.

190
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:30,818
By fainting!

191
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:32,754
(doorbell rings)

192
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:35,189
If you're my wife's
secret lover, come in.

193
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,625
There's nothing
I can do for her anymore.

194
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,660
I am looking
for my <i>amigo de la pluma.</i>

195
00:08:39,695 --> 00:08:41,262
Or "pen pal."

196
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:42,897
(gasps) Eduardo?

197
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:43,965
Is it really you?

198
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:45,533
Why are you here?

199
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,769
To save the soul
of Homer Simpson.

200
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:49,604
Now where is he, old man?

201
00:08:49,638 --> 00:08:51,305
I'm Homer Simpson!

202
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,407
<i>Ay, dios mio!</i>

203
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:53,508
What has happened to you?

204
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:55,743
(speaking in Spanish)

205
00:08:55,778 --> 00:08:57,578
Did your hair burn
off in a fire

206
00:08:57,613 --> 00:08:58,913
that trapped you
in a candy factory?

207
00:08:58,947 --> 00:09:00,882
I wish.

208
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,601
Marge Simpson.

209
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:10,003
It's so nice
to meet a friend

210
00:09:10,037 --> 00:09:12,539
Homer met through the mail
who isn't a sea monkey.

211
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:14,574
Yes, Eduardo Barcelona.

212
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:17,043
Or in English, Eddie Miami.
Homie,

213
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:18,611
I thought a visit
from your old pen pal

214
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:20,046
would cheer you up.

215
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,215
Ah, how eagerly
I would wait for a letter

216
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:25,552
from the <i>EstadosUnidos,</i>
and Homer Simpson.

217
00:09:27,454 --> 00:09:29,188
HOMER:
"Buenos días, Eduardo."

218
00:09:29,223 --> 00:09:32,292
HOMER (continues):

219
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:34,427
(chuckles)

220
00:09:34,461 --> 00:09:36,763
What happened
to us, Eduardo?

221
00:09:36,797 --> 00:09:39,632
We had so many things
we were going to do.

222
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:41,935
And I, my friend,
have been doing them.

223
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:43,169
Yeah, well, listen, pal.

224
00:09:43,203 --> 00:09:44,837
I have my treasure--

225
00:09:44,872 --> 00:09:46,839
my wife and my children.

226
00:09:46,874 --> 00:09:48,608
Ooh!

227
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:49,642
I've had eight wives

228
00:09:49,677 --> 00:09:51,277
and 200 children!

229
00:09:51,312 --> 00:09:54,714
Among them artists, doctors
and revolutionary chefs.

230
00:09:54,748 --> 00:09:56,316
Do you have a
disrespectful son

231
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,051
who calls you by
your first name?

232
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:00,286
I cannot imagine
such a creature.

233
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:02,088
Hey, Homer.
Did you just fart?

234
00:10:02,122 --> 00:10:04,424
Did you
just fart, <i>sir.</i>

235
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,425
Whatever.

236
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:06,893
Easy, easy, Homer.

237
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:10,263
I want to help you fulfill
some of your childhood dreams.

238
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:11,931
Really? Now?

239
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:13,933
I have two pizzas coming.

240
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:15,969
I wanted to see who
would get here first.

241
00:10:16,003 --> 00:10:17,103
Now, Homer!

242
00:10:17,137 --> 00:10:18,271
Get your coat.

243
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:20,106
I asked him here
to cheer you up.

244
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,474
But I didn't think
you'd drop everything

245
00:10:21,508 --> 00:10:22,976
to go gallivanting

246
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,445
with some, no offense, Spaniard.

247
00:10:26,313 --> 00:10:27,914
I promise you
one thing, madam.

248
00:10:27,948 --> 00:10:30,249
When I return your husband,
he will be happy,

249
00:10:30,284 --> 00:10:33,453
bringing a new sense
of adventure to your marriage...

250
00:10:33,487 --> 00:10:35,355
and to the bedroom.

251
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:37,857
(panting)
I'm not used to strange men

252
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:40,059
saying the word
"bedroom" around me.

253
00:10:40,094 --> 00:10:42,295
Would you prefer, uh,
<i>"sala deamor"?</i>

254
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:43,930
That's even worse.

255
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:45,298
Could you say it
one more time?

256
00:10:45,332 --> 00:10:46,432
<i>Sala de amor.</i>

257
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:49,135
(gasps) Ooh!

258
00:10:50,504 --> 00:10:51,571
Hello, children.

259
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:53,606
I hold before you a copy

260
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:55,742
of the school's new honor code.

261
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:56,743
(all groaning)

262
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:57,844
I know if I can get

263
00:10:57,878 --> 00:11:00,013
the toughest kid in class
to sign it,

264
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:01,514
the rest of you will sign it.

265
00:11:01,548 --> 00:11:02,582
Milhouse?

266
00:11:06,253 --> 00:11:08,421
(grunts)
He's not the toughest kid, I am!

267
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:10,490
Mm-hmm!

268
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:12,325
Now, the smartest kid.

269
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:13,960
Milhouse?

270
00:11:13,994 --> 00:11:15,662
He's not the smartest kid.

271
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:18,631
I am.

272
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,501
Now the class nerd.

273
00:11:21,535 --> 00:11:24,170
Milhouse?

274
00:11:24,204 --> 00:11:26,205
(sighs): Oh.

275
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,776
(snickers)

276
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:33,246
Homer, are you prepared
to achieve the dreams

277
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,681
of a ten year old?

278
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:37,617
I took the liberty of crossing
off the, uh, stupid ones.

279
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:42,588
Now, this book
of your childhood drawings

280
00:11:42,623 --> 00:11:44,090
will come to life.

281
00:11:44,124 --> 00:11:46,192
Why are you doing this?

282
00:11:46,226 --> 00:11:48,628
Wait, are you in love with me?

283
00:11:48,662 --> 00:11:51,164
In love
with the concept of you, yes.

284
00:11:51,198 --> 00:11:54,934
Woo-hoo! I'm an attractive
concept like Liberty!

285
00:11:57,838 --> 00:12:00,206
(siren wailing)

286
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,207
(tires screech)

287
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:02,975
One more ride?

288
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,510
All right.

289
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:06,713
Don't forget to ring the bell.

290
00:12:06,747 --> 00:12:08,247
(bell ringing)

291
00:12:10,484 --> 00:12:12,318
(laughing, grunting)

292
00:12:12,352 --> 00:12:13,853
I'm sick of pirates

293
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:16,189
off the street ruining my play!

294
00:12:16,223 --> 00:12:19,659
I'm going back to my old career!

295
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:21,094
Care to see a dessert menu?

296
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:24,030
We have the best cobbler
since Daniel Day-Lewis.

297
00:12:29,136 --> 00:12:31,604
How much did this
cost to restage?

298
00:12:31,638 --> 00:12:34,874
They rented everything from
Comic Book Guy for ten bucks.

299
00:12:36,143 --> 00:12:37,877
Don't stink up
the Gorn head.

300
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:40,747
I need it
for a Bar Mitzvah later.

301
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:42,048
(birds chirping)

302
00:12:42,082 --> 00:12:44,417
Now don't forget,
this is the first exam

303
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:45,818
under the new honor code.

304
00:12:45,853 --> 00:12:47,153
They're doing it.

305
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:48,454
They're self-proctoring.

306
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:50,790
Can't you say anything
in a normal way?

307
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:53,893
The answer, sadly,
is not yes.

308
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:55,228
(crickets trilling)

309
00:12:55,262 --> 00:12:57,163
I don't know what it is

310
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:58,731
about having
all my dreams fulfilled,

311
00:12:58,766 --> 00:13:00,633
but I feel great!

312
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,902
Oh, if you're
happy I'm happy.

313
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:03,903
What?

314
00:13:03,937 --> 00:13:05,304
That doesn't sound happy.

315
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,640
I feel kind of, oh...

316
00:13:07,674 --> 00:13:09,575
melancholy.

317
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,878
Mmm, melon collie.

318
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:13,513
(barking)

319
00:13:13,547 --> 00:13:15,148
That's not helping.

320
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:17,550
Well, what was
your childhood dream?

321
00:13:17,584 --> 00:13:19,185
Jumping on the bed.

322
00:13:19,219 --> 00:13:21,220
But I never disobeyed
my parents.

323
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:22,388
Till I married you.

324
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:24,190
Let's do it.

325
00:13:24,224 --> 00:13:26,359
Oh, I'm a little tired.

326
00:13:26,393 --> 00:13:28,127
Could we just snuggle again?

327
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:29,595
We do that every night!

328
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,630
Come on!

329
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:31,998
Jump on the bed!

330
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:36,169
(Homer giggling)
Ooh, okay!

331
00:13:36,203 --> 00:13:38,104
(both laughing)

332
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:39,505
Can I help you, stranger?

333
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,641
I am just watching
my friend and his wife

334
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:44,343
innocently pleasure
themselves in bed.

335
00:13:44,378 --> 00:13:45,511
That sounds salty,

336
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:47,079
but you seem sweet.

337
00:13:47,114 --> 00:13:48,848
I'm gonna call you
Kettle Corn.

338
00:13:51,051 --> 00:13:54,787
Eduardo, I haven't felt
this good in years.

339
00:13:54,822 --> 00:13:56,823
You're like the Tooth Fairy.

340
00:13:56,857 --> 00:13:59,525
Except you don't collect
human bones.

341
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,428
Yes, yes. Of course I don't.

342
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:03,629
Here.

343
00:14:03,664 --> 00:14:04,730
So, that's it?

344
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:07,300
All my dreams, lived?

345
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:09,035
Eh... all but one.

346
00:14:09,069 --> 00:14:10,169
Well, we've got to do it!

347
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:12,205
I never leave
a job unfinished.

348
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:13,973
It's as true now as that week

349
00:14:14,007 --> 00:14:15,741
I worked
on the high school yearbook.

350
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:17,210
So much infighting.

351
00:14:17,244 --> 00:14:18,744
I had to get out of there.

352
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:21,547
All right, Homer,
we shall do this thing.

353
00:14:21,582 --> 00:14:24,016
The editor put in
like six pictures of this girl

354
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:26,385
'cause she was his girlfriend.

355
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,120
Everyone has a
bad yearbook story.

356
00:14:28,155 --> 00:14:29,188
They spelled my name wrong!

357
00:14:29,223 --> 00:14:30,289
Get over it! Ha!

358
00:14:30,324 --> 00:14:31,324
D'oh!

359
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:34,193
(propellers churning)

360
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:36,128
So don't do what I did.

361
00:14:36,163 --> 00:14:38,431
That concludes our safety video.

362
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:40,132
(grunts)

363
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:42,401
Just step out that door

364
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:44,337
and you can glide to earth

365
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:45,872
like your boyhood hero...

366
00:14:45,906 --> 00:14:48,641
Rocky the Flying Squirrel.

367
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:51,711
Uh, actually,
my hero

368
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:54,146
was the actress
who provided Rocky's voice,

369
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:55,948
June Foray.

370
00:14:55,983 --> 00:14:58,351
A true legend
in the voice-over community.

371
00:14:58,385 --> 00:15:00,253
I'm just gonna stay on the plane

372
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:01,854
and think about her influence.

373
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:03,222
She has lived her life.

374
00:15:03,257 --> 00:15:04,690
Now, you must live yours.

375
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:05,725
No!

376
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:06,759
Do not worry!

377
00:15:06,793 --> 00:15:08,628
I will follow
the trail of your fear!

378
00:15:08,662 --> 00:15:09,662
(Homer yells)

379
00:15:09,696 --> 00:15:11,163
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Will Homer make it?</i>

380
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:13,132
<i>Or will he leave</i>
<i>a crater the size</i>

381
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,368
<i>of the one</i>
<i>that destroyed the Yucatan?</i>

382
00:15:15,402 --> 00:15:18,070
<i>Find out in our next</i>
<i>exciting installment:</i>

383
00:15:18,105 --> 00:15:19,405
Fat Splat...

384
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:21,908
<i>or</i> When You Squish
Upon a Car.

385
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,527
Mmm, it's amazing.

386
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:32,164
Every day has the peace
and serenity of a flu outbreak.

387
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:35,467
(laughs) Guess I'll be getting
some extra credit for this.

388
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,235
Lisa, I'm afraid you've gotten

389
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,637
all the extra credit
we can give out.

390
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,173
So Willie has been
growing you a nice pumpkin.

391
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,674
Here it is, lass.

392
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:45,844
You want me to carve it
into a thank-o'-lantern?

393
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,012
No, this is good.

394
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,984
Well, this knife's got
to carve something.

395
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,019
(menacing music playing)

396
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,289
(grunting)

397
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,290
Homer!

398
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,958
(grunts thrice)

399
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:01,493
You don't have to flap.

400
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,595
Just glide on the wind.

401
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,731
Uh, okay.

402
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,699
Flap! Flap! Flap!
Flap! Flap! Flap!

403
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:10,102
(grunts twice)

404
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,871
Yes, good,
much better.

405
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:18,643
(groans)

406
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,679
I got Bart's backpack.

407
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,815
He got a hundred on his test?

408
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,851
That's impossible.

409
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,189
(gasps)
Is Bart cheating?

410
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,858
Are the Pope's tweets
infallible?

411
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,860
(laughs)

412
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,328
Bart, I'm gonna tell!

413
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,396
No, you're not.

414
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,164
Because if you tell people
I cheated,

415
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,665
that means your system failed.

416
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,934
Oh, my God,
you found a loophole!

417
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:46,238
Why don't you put this much
inventiveness into your work?

418
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,440
Because then I'd be the one
thing I swore I wouldn't.

419
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:49,608
You.

420
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,743
(whistling)

421
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,848
I'm doing it!

422
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,517
I'm flying like the squirrel

423
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,919
I always knew I was.

424
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:05,257
Ooh, indigo!

425
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,192
MARGE: Homer?
(yells gibberish)

426
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,594
It's me,
talking in your earphone.

427
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,263
Come down, Homie.

428
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,631
"You only live once"

429
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:16,268
also means when you die,
you die!

430
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,303
(cries out)

431
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,372
What's going on?

432
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,640
Hello?
(goose honks)

433
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:22,707
Hmm?
(honks)

434
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:23,708
Hmm? Hmm?
(honks)

435
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,110
Are you mocking me?

436
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,079
You can listen to your
wife when you are dead.

437
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:28,780
Savor the moment.

438
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,437
Majestic eagle.

439
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:56,308
Just like me,
unashamed of his baldness.

440
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,642
(eagle cries)

441
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,644
So beautiful.

442
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,413
Aw, he probably sees a mouse

443
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,148
he wants to tear in half.

444
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,149
(grunts)

445
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,584
D'oh!

446
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:08,653
Stupid tallest building
in Springfield!

447
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,689
(grunting)

448
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:16,895
Hmm...

449
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,029
(grunts)

450
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:20,065
(grunting)

451
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,136
Ha!
Whoa!

452
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,038
You've presented me
with quite a conundrum.

453
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,240
A word you should know

454
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:31,476
since it was on a
vocabulary test you aced.

455
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:32,711
(giggles)

456
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:36,548
But after some thought,
all my worries went away.

457
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,150
I know the answer.

458
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:41,486
I'm gonna force you
to turn yourself in.

459
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:42,587
Good luck with that.

460
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,822
The only thing that'll change
my mind

461
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,857
is a sign from God.

462
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,561
(Bart grunts)

463
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,397
Son, it was so beautiful!

464
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,700
I went faster
than the speed of sound.

465
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,736
(Homer yelling)

466
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:00,338
(grunts)

467
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,740
Well, Bart, is that enough

468
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,441
of a sign for you?

469
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,710
All right, I'll turn myself in.

470
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,445
It'll give me a chance
to work some more

471
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,214
on the detention quilt.

472
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,483
(humming a tune)

473
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,485
(all grunting)

474
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,487
This patch is
for all the victims

475
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,323
of atomic wedgies.

476
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,726
My friend,
you've lived your dreams.

477
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,629
No matter what,
Homer Simpson has done it.

478
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,966
And soon I hope I remember
who Homer Simpson is

479
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,168
and his relationship to me.

480
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:31,703
But I have no regrets.

481
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:35,073
In fact, all this
has given me a sense of calm

482
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,909
I've never had before.

483
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,411
That's the morphine.

484
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,913
Can you give me the
morphine forever?

485
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:42,914
No way!

486
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:44,282
A person on morphine
all the time

487
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,318
would constantly dissolve
in inappropriate laughter.

488
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:50,088
(laughs)

489
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,423
(sighs)

490
00:19:55,924 --> 00:19:57,725
Eduardo? Eduardo! Eduardo!

491
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,159
(grunts)

492
00:20:00,362 --> 00:20:01,462
Oh.

493
00:20:01,496 --> 00:20:03,597
It was all just a dream.

494
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:05,232
EDUARDO:
It was not just a dream.

495
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:07,234
And you said you'd drive me
to the airport.

496
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:08,569
Oh, yeah.

497
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:09,670
Great.

498
00:20:09,704 --> 00:20:11,138
Um...

499
00:20:11,172 --> 00:20:12,373
Do I drop you at the curb

500
00:20:12,407 --> 00:20:14,341
or do I have to park
and walk you in?

501
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:17,244
Go as far as your heart
will take you.

502
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:21,081
You are a good friend.
