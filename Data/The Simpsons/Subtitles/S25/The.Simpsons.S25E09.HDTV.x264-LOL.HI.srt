his powers <i>from</i> his suit?

8
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:21,939

wear it, he'll die.

00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:42,137
but this backyard is
a little slice of Heaven,

179
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:43,471
all thanks to
Homer Simpson!

180
00:06:43,506 --> 00:06:45,173
(cheering)

181
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:46,775
This is fun!

182
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:48,476
And it was so nice
of the movie company

183
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,278
to let you show their film.

184
00:06:50,312 --> 00:06:52,380
Let me?
Uh, sweetheart,

185
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,216
I downloaded it off
the Internet...

186
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:56,951
illegally.

187
00:06:56,986 --> 00:06:59,087
An illegal download?

188
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:02,223
But Hollywood says stealing
from Hollywood is wrong.

189
00:07:02,258 --> 00:07:04,726
(scoffs) Why should
a regular guy like me

190
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,361
have to spend
15 bucks a ticket

191
00:07:06,395 --> 00:07:08,730
so studios can pay
huge salaries

192
00:07:08,764 --> 00:07:11,866
to the <i>Air Buds</i> and
Ray Liottas of the world?

193
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:14,069
Oh!

194
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:16,504
When I watched
that pirated movie,

195
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:18,740
I was stealing with my eyes.

196
00:07:18,774 --> 00:07:21,176
So I'm repaying the
good people in Hollywood

197
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,478
for the ticket
I should have bought.

198
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:25,580
Now this money will end up
in the hands

199
00:07:25,614 --> 00:07:27,215
of the talented people

200
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:30,351
who make magic happen
on the silver screen.

201
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:39,294
(inhales) Ah...

202
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:42,530
(startled gasp)

203
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:44,199
Karen, get me the FBI!

204
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,433
Karen!

205
00:07:58,114 --> 00:08:00,882
You people joined this
squad for one reason:

206
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,650
to fight movie pirates.

207
00:08:02,685 --> 00:08:04,385
I wanted to catch
serial killers.

208
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,387
(mocking, whiny tone): "I wanted to catch
serial killers."

209
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:08,223
From now on, you will
lay down your lives

210
00:08:08,257 --> 00:08:10,558
to protect America's
chick flicks, buddy comedies

211
00:08:10,593 --> 00:08:13,661
and steady stream
of animated misfires.

212
00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:16,564
Sir, you have
to see this.

213
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:17,966
"Took it off the Web...

214
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,167
"watched for free...

215
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:21,169
never pay for a movie again"?

216
00:08:21,203 --> 00:08:23,438
Men, set your guns on "kill."

217
00:08:23,472 --> 00:08:26,141
We're going after Homer Simpson.

218
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:27,475
I now present,

219
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,644
direct from the computer
of an angry editor

220
00:08:29,678 --> 00:08:31,412
at a special effects house,

221
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:34,415
<i>Cosmic Wars Episode Seven.</i>

222
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,785
(epic orchestral theme playing)

223
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,227
(audience cheering)

224
00:08:46,262 --> 00:08:49,197
My childhood has been un-ruined!

225
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:02,544
Listen up, seat meat!

226
00:09:02,578 --> 00:09:04,112
You are all in violation of

227
00:09:04,146 --> 00:09:06,548
Title 17
of the U.S. Copyright Code.

228
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:07,615
(all gasping)

229
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,450
Easy there, hotshot.

230
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:11,653
All the people are doing
is watching a movie.

231
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:13,955
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

232
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:15,356
I'm not wearing an undershirt

233
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:17,959
and my badge is
poking into my skin.

234
00:09:17,993 --> 00:09:19,327
What's going on here?

235
00:09:19,361 --> 00:09:21,296
Is there a fondler
in the neighborhood?

236
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,564
I'm here to arrest

237
00:09:22,598 --> 00:09:24,399
and hopefully stage
the prison suicide

238
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,367
of the mastermind of
this operation--

239
00:09:26,402 --> 00:09:27,702
Homer Simpson!

240
00:09:27,736 --> 00:09:29,571
Ooh, mastermind.

241
00:09:29,605 --> 00:09:32,140
We got our man,
thanks to a tip

242
00:09:32,174 --> 00:09:34,576
from a heroic
American snitch.

243
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,378
(gasps) One of you
turned me in?

244
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:40,114
Who was it?

245
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:41,316
You!

246
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:44,352
Superintendent
Chalmers,

247
00:09:44,386 --> 00:09:46,054
you never forgave me
for that time

248
00:09:46,088 --> 00:09:48,389
we wore the same Hawaiian
shirt to that luau!

249
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:51,593
They're gonna
take Dad!

250
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:53,461
We gotta do something!
I'm on it.

251
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:02,203
(screams)
Copyrighted material!

252
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:04,138
Don't look at it!

253
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:06,007
Someone sell me
a ticket!

254
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,342
Ear plugs in!
Blinders on!

255
00:10:07,376 --> 00:10:09,677
We trained
for this!

256
00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:18,486
(gunshot)

257
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,055
(grunting)

258
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:26,661
From now on,

259
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:28,529
the only place you'll
be watching movies

260
00:10:28,564 --> 00:10:30,365
without having to buy
a ticket is jail.

261
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:34,002
Oh... oh... (whimpers)

262
00:10:34,036 --> 00:10:36,204
Baby, promise me

263
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:37,672
you'll find out
who turned me in.

264
00:10:37,706 --> 00:10:39,340
(moans)

265
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,643
It's probably someone
I would never suspect.

266
00:10:41,677 --> 00:10:43,511
Never suspect.

267
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:45,146
(moans)

268
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,649
Your moans of sympathy
are all I have.

269
00:10:47,683 --> 00:10:49,617
Oh...

270
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:51,619
HOMER: Whoever did this to me
will be haunted

271
00:10:51,654 --> 00:10:54,188
by unbearable guilt forever!

272
00:10:55,324 --> 00:10:56,591
Forever!

273
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:06,283
What are you guys in for?

274
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:07,351
Bank robbery.

275
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,970
Drug trafficking.

276
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:10,038
What about you?

277
00:11:10,072 --> 00:11:11,239
Movie piracy.

278
00:11:11,273 --> 00:11:12,273
(all gasp)
What?!

279
00:11:12,307 --> 00:11:13,541
People in show business

280
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:15,743
work hard
to make those movies.

281
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:19,881
My media stocks under-performed
because of people like you.

282
00:11:19,915 --> 00:11:22,083
My brother lost his job
as a grip

283
00:11:22,117 --> 00:11:24,419
on a movie set
because of piracy.

284
00:11:24,453 --> 00:11:26,687
He had to sell his Jet Ski.

285
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:29,590
A grip without a Jet Ski
ain't no grip at all!

286
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,792
(yelling)

287
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:35,897
You're about to find out

288
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:39,100
what we do to
copyright infringers.

289
00:11:39,134 --> 00:11:40,101
(yelling)

290
00:11:40,135 --> 00:11:41,736
(tires screech)

291
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:45,206
(all clamoring)

292
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:50,978
(train horn blowing
in distance)

293
00:11:51,013 --> 00:11:52,080
Uh... huh?

294
00:11:52,114 --> 00:11:53,781
(horn blowing)
Huh...? (screams)

295
00:11:55,117 --> 00:11:57,351
(men yelling)

296
00:11:57,386 --> 00:11:59,520
(grunting)

297
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:04,859
(screams)

298
00:12:08,163 --> 00:12:09,263
Whoo-hoo!

299
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:21,976
It's almost
like having Dad here.

300
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,645
Only with less growling
when I go near his food.

301
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,115
I just want to know who
dropped the dime on Dad.

302
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:28,616
Lousy rat.

303
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,985
Maybe the person
that turned your father in

304
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,488
thought they were doing
the right thing.

305
00:12:33,522 --> 00:12:35,156
Homer just pirated a movie.

306
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,191
But it's not the worst thing
Dad ever did.

307
00:12:37,226 --> 00:12:39,927
It's not even the worst kind
of pirate Dad's ever been.

308
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:41,262
Lisa, tell your brother

309
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:42,997
that stealing is wrong,
no matter what.

310
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:44,332
I don't know.

311
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:46,634
It wasn't like Dad was
stealing for himself.

312
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:49,337
He created this wonderful
experience for the whole town.

313
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:52,707
I just can't imagine
anyone turning him in.

314
00:12:56,044 --> 00:12:57,345
(door creaking open)

315
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:58,940
Dad, Dad, you're back, you're back!
Hey!

316
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:00,848
Dad, you're back! Dad!

317
00:13:00,883 --> 00:13:03,117
Homer, what are you doing
out of prison?

318
00:13:03,152 --> 00:13:05,586
You have to go back
and give yourself up.

319
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:07,588
I can't go back to jail!

320
00:13:07,623 --> 00:13:10,491
There's no shampoo, just soap!

321
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:12,793
Wait, I know one place
in Springfield

322
00:13:12,828 --> 00:13:16,531
that doesn't care
about Internet piracy laws.

323
00:13:19,735 --> 00:13:21,068
Thanks for taking us in.

324
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:23,838
Our family always
appreciates asylum.

325
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:27,275
This consulate is
like being on Swedish soil.

326
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:30,511
You're as safe here as you would
be in the Skatteskrapan.

327
00:13:30,546 --> 00:13:31,746
(whistles)

328
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,581
Your country
doesn't think illegally

329
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:35,816
downloading movies is wrong?

330
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:37,185
The people of Sweden believe

331
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:38,886
all movies should
be shared freely.

332
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:41,155
How is that not stealing?

333
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,258
Bah, your Hollywood studios
are the real thieves,

334
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:47,195
claiming all their hit movies
have lost money.

335
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:49,897
I spit on their bookkeeping.

336
00:13:49,932 --> 00:13:52,767
Yeah, and why don't they
make a sequel to <i>Taken</i>

337
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:54,769
where <i>The Hangover</i> guys
get taken

338
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:56,370
and the only ones
that could rescue them

339
00:13:56,405 --> 00:13:57,939
is <i>Fast and Furious.</i>

340
00:13:57,973 --> 00:14:00,841
Aw, man, I would
love to pirate that.

341
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:03,678
As would
the proud people of Sweden.

342
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:05,246
(sirens blaring)

343
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,081
(tires screeching)

344
00:14:09,685 --> 00:14:11,085
They've found us!

345
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:13,387
There's only one surefire way
to get fugitives

346
00:14:13,422 --> 00:14:15,056
out of a foreign building--

347
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,124
blasting death metal.

348
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:20,428

You like this?

352
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,304
Oh-oh, Swedes love death metal.

353
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:33,474
It reminds us of death.

354
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:37,111
Damn those Peace Prize-giving
fish-smokers.

355
00:14:39,014 --> 00:14:42,750
I'm so tired of being trapped
in this embassy.

356
00:14:42,784 --> 00:14:44,118
Consulate.

357
00:14:44,152 --> 00:14:45,786
Consulates are regional offices,

358
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:48,122
which serve the embassy
in the capitol.

359
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:51,158
Thank you so much
for sticking with me

360
00:14:51,193 --> 00:14:52,460
through all this.

361
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:54,762
You're the greatest
wife in the world.

362
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:56,497
(moaning)

363
00:14:56,531 --> 00:14:58,399
It was me!

364
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,735
I was the one who
told the FBI.

365
00:15:02,304 --> 00:15:03,271
You?

366
00:15:03,305 --> 00:15:04,705
How could you?

367
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,641
You're my own flesh and blood.

368
00:15:06,675 --> 00:15:09,410
I was just trying
to do the right thing.

369
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:11,312
Who would've thought
the authorities

370
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:13,547
would use a confession
against me?

371
00:15:13,582 --> 00:15:16,917
Have you forgotten what you
promised at our wedding?

372
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:18,419
To love and cherish?

373
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:19,920
To aid and abet?

374
00:15:19,955 --> 00:15:22,757
I never wanted
to say funny vows.

375
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,659
Well, you did!
And they got laughs.

376
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:26,427
Solid laughs!

377
00:15:26,461 --> 00:15:28,095
I didn't mean
for this to happen,

378
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,164
but you <i>were</i> stealing.

379
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:33,067
All I ever had was
you looking out for me.

380
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:35,536
I got nothing now.

381
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:48,449
♪

382
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:07,902
All rise in the matter

383
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:09,503
of <i>The People vs.</i>
<i>Homer Simpson.</i>

384
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:13,107
The people call Hollywood
ultra-producer, Judd Apatow.

385
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:15,810
Homer Simpson is
an enemy of art.

386
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:18,045
Art created by writers,
directors,

387
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,649
and the guy who uses a computer
to erase or enhance nipples.

388
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:24,185
And not just the people
who dream for a living,

389
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:26,187
but the people
who depend on us.

390
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:27,888
The spin class instructors,

391
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:30,458
the personal rabbis, Seth Rogen.

392
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:32,993
(laughing)

393
00:16:34,463 --> 00:16:36,397
(crying):
It's true, I need him.

394
00:16:36,431 --> 00:16:39,033
I saw a bootleg DVD
of <i>The 40 Year Old Virgin</i>

395
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:40,634
for sale at a car wash.

396
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:43,738
They left off
my director's commentary!

397
00:16:43,772 --> 00:16:45,806
It didn't even have
a blooper reel!

398
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:46,974
(all groaning)

399
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:48,642
<i>(gavel banging)</i>

400
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:50,344
Homer Simpson,
you have been found guilty

401
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:52,279
of illegal reproduction
and distribution

402
00:16:52,314 --> 00:16:54,048
of copyrighted material.

403
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:56,384
Before sentencing, do you have
anything to say for yourself?

404
00:16:56,418 --> 00:16:57,167
No.

405
00:16:57,192 --> 00:16:59,877
Homer, tell them
your side of the story.

406
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:03,391
I know I hurt you,
but please trust me now.

407
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:05,726
It'll work.

408
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:08,062
You know what, Judge Apatow?

409
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:10,498
I do have something to say.

410
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:13,033
These movie people
may say I'm a pirate,

411
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:14,568
but I'm just a man.

412
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:17,104
A man who loved Hollywood
too much.

413
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:19,974
So I made my own rules
and fought the big guys

414
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:22,543
who tried to destroy
my way of life.

415
00:17:22,577 --> 00:17:24,011
He doesn't sound
like a villain.

416
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:25,613
He sounds
like a classic underdog.

417
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:27,548
He's the unlikeliest
of heroes!

418
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:29,550
But where's
the love story?

419
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:31,352
At first my wife
didn't believe in me.

420
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:34,755
Maybe we forgot why we fell
in love in the first place.

421
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,425
But when times seemed darkest,
one minute ago,

422
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:40,895
she was there and gave me
the strength and courage

423
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:44,532
to fight for what I believe in.

424
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:47,334
He's a downloading David
versus a greedy Goliath.

425
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:50,337
An Erin Brockovich
but with more cleavage!

426
00:17:50,372 --> 00:17:52,573
Two, three... Good
Lord, he's hitting

427
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:54,875
all four quadrants!

428
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,045
One family, against all odds,
took on the system...

429
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,014
and lost.

430
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:01,582
(clamoring)

431
00:18:01,616 --> 00:18:03,984
Mr. Simpson, I'd like to buy
the rights to make a movie

432
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,319
based on your true story.

433
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:07,188
I'm attached
as executive producer!

434
00:18:07,222 --> 00:18:08,389
Attached! Attached!

435
00:18:08,423 --> 00:18:11,559
One movie?
We envision a trilogy.

436
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:13,534
Will Smith's family wants
to play your family.

437
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,962
I'd be Jaden.

438
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:16,931
(all clamoring)

439
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:18,999
On behalf of Hollywood,

440
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:22,269
we are dropping all charges.

441
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:23,971
These people hate my dad.

442
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:26,640
How can they want
to make a movie about him?

443
00:18:26,675 --> 00:18:28,642
Hollywood may be run
by big corporations

444
00:18:28,677 --> 00:18:31,178
trying to squash people,
but they make movies

445
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:33,447
about people standing up
to big corporations

446
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:35,749
trying to squash them
and winning.

447
00:18:35,784 --> 00:18:38,752
I'll sign with whoever
can convince Channing Tatum

448
00:18:38,787 --> 00:18:41,388
to gain the most weight
to play me.

449
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:50,431
Surprise! - Surprise!
Surprise!

450
00:18:50,465 --> 00:18:51,932
What the hell
is all this?

451
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:53,300
We're so excited
about your movie

452
00:18:53,335 --> 00:18:55,135
that we're having
a special screening.

453
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,605
But the movie isn't in theaters
till next week.

454
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:59,607
Yeah, we ripped a version
off Bootleg Bay

455
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:01,208
just like you taught us.

456
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:02,543
It's still got timecode on it,

457
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:04,945
but, otherwise,
it's a clean copy.

458
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,447
(chuckles)

459
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:08,749
You're pirating
my movie?

460
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:11,352
The hell you are!
Piracy is stealing!

461
00:19:11,386 --> 00:19:14,889
You're taking money out
of my family's mouths!

462
00:19:14,923 --> 00:19:16,323
(gasping)

463
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:19,026
But the movie is... i-it's
about you pirating movies.

464
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,895
Oh, that's Hollywood fantasy.

465
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:24,965
We live in the real world,
where I have something called...

466
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,635
prof-it par-tic-i-pa-tion.

467
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:29,870
That's negative, man.

468
00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:31,505
Oh, Homie...

469
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:36,043
Now all of you go see my movie
in the theater the day it opens!

470
00:19:36,077 --> 00:19:37,912
No bargain matinees!

471
00:19:37,946 --> 00:19:40,114
And tell your friends
it was great!

472
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:43,183
Buy the stuff they advertise
in the commercials before it!

473
00:19:43,218 --> 00:19:46,053
Homer in the movie
wears Ask Body Spray

474
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:47,988
and so should you!

475
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:50,424
Don't ask! Do smell!

476
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,052
Homie, do you really think
you should be...

477
00:19:52,077 --> 00:19:53,260
Up-bup-bup-bup-bup!

478
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:56,897
What have we learned about not
blindly supporting our husband?

479
00:19:56,932 --> 00:19:59,266
Ask Body Spray!

480
00:20:01,303 --> 00:20:06,303

481
00:20:14,595 --> 00:20:16,329
But then when times
seemed darkest,

482
00:20:16,363 --> 00:20:19,032
she was there; she gave me
the strength and courage

483
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:21,000
to fight for what I believe in.

484
00:20:21,035 --> 00:20:23,002
On behalf of Hollywood,

485
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:26,673
we're dropping all charges!

486

487
00:20:29,443 --> 00:20:31,811
(laughing)

488
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:34,080
So what do you think, Lise?
Who are the good guys here,

489
00:20:34,114 --> 00:20:36,950
the media companies or
the Internet freedom guys?

490
00:20:36,984 --> 00:20:39,285
Well, both groups claim
their intentions are noble,

491
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,955
but at the end of the day,
they're both trying to steal

492
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:43,823
as much money as they can.

493
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:46,092
So... everyone's a pirate?

494
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:47,860
And the worst one of all is...

495
00:21:28,636 --> 00:21:31,437
(Seth Rogen laughing)

496
00:21:32,613 --> 00:21:34,614
Shh!
