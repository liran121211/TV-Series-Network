33
00:01:50,347 --> 00:01:53,215
I'm here to tell you about
a field trip so amazing,

34
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,484
we've put "sign here" stickers
on the permission slips.

35
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,954
As you recall, these stickers
came from last year's field trip

36
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:00,656
to the "sign here"
sticker factory.

37
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:02,792

to my old navy buddy--

00:02:02,826 --> 00:02:06,028
we both love to shop
at Old Navy--

39
00:02:06,063 --> 00:02:09,031
the students of this school
will be taking a ride

40
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:10,700
on a nuclear-powered,
attack-class submarine,

41
00:02:10,734 --> 00:02:13,903
the USS <i>Tom Clancy!</i>

42
00:02:22,946 --> 00:02:23,913

So you're all excited, eh?

45
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:27,350
ALL:
Yay!

46
00:02:27,384 --> 00:02:28,651
Well, that's too bad,

47
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:30,353
because many of you
will not be going.

48
00:02:30,387 --> 00:02:31,387
ALL:
Huh?!

49
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:32,822
There's limited room

50
00:02:32,856 --> 00:02:35,057
on the submarine, so only
the best-behaved students--

51
00:02:35,092 --> 00:02:37,226
as determined by me--

52
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,894
will go on the trip.

53
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:43,766
Whoo-hoo!
Well, I get to go!

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,234
To increase the tension,

55
00:02:45,268 --> 00:02:46,869
everyone starts
with a clean slate.

56
00:02:46,903 --> 00:02:49,271
But from this moment on...

57
00:02:49,306 --> 00:02:51,273
I am the law.

58
00:02:51,308 --> 00:02:53,008

what's your favorite food to eat
when you're disappointed?

74
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:35,918
I'm going shopping tomorrow.

75
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:38,487
Ice cream sandwiches. Why?

76
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:40,423
What your mother
is trying to say

77
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:42,825
is we don't think
you can be good that long.

78
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:44,960
Mom, is that true?

79
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:48,264
Well, that's sort of what
I was trying to say, but...

80
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:50,633
What your mother
is trying to say is...

81
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:53,102
No, you're wrong!
You're all wrong!

82
00:03:53,136 --> 00:03:54,470
I didn't say anything.

83
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:56,806
Were you thinking it?
Yes.

84
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,574
Get real, ding-dong!

85
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:00,342
You've already done
so much bad stuff,

86
00:04:00,377 --> 00:04:02,578
Skinner's never gonna
let you on that boat.

87
00:04:02,612 --> 00:04:04,280
No, Skinner said
I had a clean slate,

88
00:04:04,314 --> 00:04:06,449
so right now, I'm as good
as any other kid.

00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:19,562
Bart, sweetie, this
is an opportunity

95
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:22,031
for you to turn things
around yet again.

96
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:24,133
And I believe in you.

00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:27,369
Thanks, Mom.

99
00:04:27,404 --> 00:04:29,472
I'll start by taking my plate
to the dishwasher.

100
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:30,806
Wherever that is.

101
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:33,008

I love Bart
as much as you do,

104
00:04:36,213 --> 00:04:37,546
but actually not.

105
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:39,215
And that kid
cannot go one week

106
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:40,516
without getting
in trouble.

107
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,552
Now, if you'd be so kind
as to start my car for me,

108
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:44,787
I'm going to Moe's.

What are you doing?

117

To avoid temptation,
I'm getting rid

118
00:05:01,638 --> 00:05:04,106
of all the things that could get
me in trouble at school.

119
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,475
I buried all my whoopee cushions
in the backyard.

120
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:11,213

Hmm?

I buried them.

Come on!

124
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:21,223
Don't take my custom limo!

125
00:05:21,258 --> 00:05:24,593
At least let me sniff my coke
out of the floor mats!

00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:34,537
Krusty, are you broke?

132
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:35,771
Yeah. All it takes

133
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:37,606
is some bad luck
at the ponies,

134
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:39,375
worse luck in
the Bitcoin market,

135
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:42,411
heavy investment in a
high-end bookmark company.

136
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:44,914
You could do what
<i>Everybody Loves Raymond</i> did.

137
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:46,882
Go off the air
while I'm still good?

138
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:49,718
That horse has left the stable,
gone to the glue factory

139
00:05:49,753 --> 00:05:52,621
and has been used
to make art projects.

140
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:55,624
I mean, you could sell
foreign rights to your show.

141
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:56,959

What I'm saying is,

154
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:27,990
you could produce
foreign versions of your TV show

155
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:29,625

from other countries.

It's not my fault
there's no water pressure.

167
00:07:13,236 --> 00:07:16,472
Excuses are like handkerchiefs;
everybody's got one.

168

Firm but fair, sir.

171
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:23,679
Don't want any troublemakers

182
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:51,573
I'm getting
strange red marks.

183
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:52,841
But I'm gonna make it!

184
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:55,077
(engine backfiring)

185
00:07:55,111 --> 00:07:56,845
Uh-oh.
(alarms buzzing)

186
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,048
Something's wrong
with my long yellow car.

187
00:07:59,082 --> 00:08:00,049
(starter chugs)

188
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,684
Any of you kids got
a Triple A card?

189
00:08:02,886 --> 00:08:04,953
What? No.
I'll be late.

190
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:07,089
Skinner will cross my name
off the list.

191
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:08,323
(grunts)

192
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:25,708
All fixed up!

193
00:08:25,742 --> 00:08:27,309
(horn honks)

194
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:30,946
(tires screech, horn drones)

195
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,457
(school bell rings)
(laughs, hums triumphantly)

196
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:43,492
Off the list.

197
00:08:43,526 --> 00:08:45,327
For what?

198
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:47,796
Muddy footprints
on the school floor. (gasps)

199
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,898
I've broken
a ten-year-old's spirit.

200
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:51,333
Time to celebrate

201
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:53,569
with a fruit-
on-the-bottom yogurt.

202
00:08:53,603 --> 00:08:56,305
Plain, plain,
plain, plain...

203
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,273
Mmm! Fruit!

204
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:09,171
No, Mother, I did not use
any of your talc.

205
00:09:09,205 --> 00:09:11,440
I don't know why
the bottle feels lighter.

206
00:09:11,474 --> 00:09:13,475
Maybe you're just getting
stronger!

207
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,445
Some days I could just kill you.

208
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:18,180
(phone rings)

209
00:09:18,214 --> 00:09:19,448
She heard me.

210
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:20,616
Hello?

211
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,410
BART (nasally voice):
Hold for the president.

212
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:24,620
OBAMA (on spliced recording):
This is... Barack Obama!

213
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:25,854
Is this a prank?

214
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,156
OBAMA: No.
(gasps)

215
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,058
That's offensive.
(gasps)

216
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:30,559
I want to...
talk about... submarines...

217
00:09:30,593 --> 00:09:31,527

218
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:32,995
Simpson... has to go.

219
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:35,130
Simpson... has to go...

220
00:09:35,165 --> 00:09:37,333
on the... submarine.
On the... submarine.

221
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:38,334
Of course.

222
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:39,635
(tweeting)

223
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:41,837

Welcome, foreign-market Krustys.

230
00:09:55,085 --> 00:09:57,519
If you examine
your "Krusty Kit,"

231
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:59,555
you're gonna find
unremovable green hair dye,

232
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,323
a used red nose

233
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:04,159
and a guidebook
on how to capture a monkey.

234
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:07,429
But now, the man they call
Mr. Monday Afternoon...

235
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:08,864
Krusty!

Now, there are many words
for what I'm looking for--

240
00:10:15,805 --> 00:10:20,209
rubles, renminbi, baht--
but they all mean money,

241
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:23,278
which rhymes with funny,
which you can be if you want.

242
00:10:23,313 --> 00:10:24,380
I don't care.

243
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:26,382
Just do the Krusty show
in your country

244
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,183
and send me ten percent.

245
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:30,252
Then send me another 60%.

246
00:10:30,286 --> 00:10:32,921
Then five percent more,
and you're good.

247
00:10:38,395 --> 00:10:39,495
Nice job, Simpson.

248
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:41,130
You even got
my Suze Orman tape

249
00:10:41,164 --> 00:10:42,631
unstuck from
the cassette player.

250
00:10:42,665 --> 00:10:45,534
She's the reason I was able
to purchase a new watch band.

251
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:48,303
Always bragging about
his watch band.

252
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:51,039
If only I could tell time.

253
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:53,375
Okay, I washed
your car like you asked,

254
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,411
I did your paper rte,

This could be the
turning point of my life.

made a difference.

What do you think?

259
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:03,519
Can I go on that sub?

260
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:06,889
Sorry, Simpson.

261
00:11:06,923 --> 00:11:09,057

Hello, boy.

00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:53,362
At times like this,

302
00:12:53,396 --> 00:12:54,930
there's not much
you can say,

303
00:12:54,964 --> 00:12:56,765

know what happened.

00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:00,102

311
00:13:08,645 --> 00:13:10,345
Aye, aye.

312
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,880
Where'd it go?

313
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:13,348
It was just
imaginary.

314
00:13:13,383 --> 00:13:14,583
I know a kid
should never

315
00:13:14,617 --> 00:13:15,951
turn to his father
for help,

316
00:13:15,985 --> 00:13:17,553
but I got screwed.

317
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:19,221
Is there anything
you can do?

318
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,759
As I always say,

319
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:25,360
don't get mad;
get dinner.

320
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:27,129

and you stabbed
me in the back.

Wait a minute, I knew you
were a neat freak, Skinner,

346
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:44,444
but you beat your rug
till it bleeds?

348
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:49,750
All right,

349
00:14:49,784 --> 00:14:53,186
I woke up and, surprisingly,
Mother wasn't there beside me.

She was dead.

351
00:14:56,924 --> 00:14:59,359
Still, I can't
be sure I killed her.

352
00:14:59,394 --> 00:15:01,862
Well, I'm sure
our town's police force

353
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:04,298
will handle this
competently.

354
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:10,037
Now, I could
investigate further,

355
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:12,839
but you don't want to sit
in a jail all weekend.

356
00:15:12,874 --> 00:15:15,876
Chief, that was
awfully arbitrary.

357
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,511
Not compared to this.

358
00:15:17,545 --> 00:15:20,213

359
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:23,150
Let me handle this.

360
00:15:23,184 --> 00:15:24,851
Just go upstairs
and shut the door.

361
00:15:24,886 --> 00:15:28,555
There are some things
only a boy should see.

362
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:30,624
(door closes)

363
00:15:30,658 --> 00:15:33,827
(both laugh)

364
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:35,329
(cackles)

365
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:42,803
Now do you want to dispose
of this jelly-soaked pillow?

366
00:15:42,837 --> 00:15:45,272
Just call me The Cleaner.

367
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,908
(slurps)

368
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:55,082
Um, where's the body?

369
00:15:55,116 --> 00:15:56,616
She's in a better place.

370
00:15:57,685 --> 00:15:59,419
(chain saw rumbling)

371
00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:02,756
The deed is done.

372
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,524
Oh, I wish you'd
asked me before you...

373
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,493
Look, you kill them,
I get rid of them.

374
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:07,761
That's always
been our deal.

375
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:09,062
But I do have one question:

376
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:10,364
Do you want the head?

377
00:16:10,398 --> 00:16:12,265
No, no, God, no.

378
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,534
Well, if you change your mind,
it'll be in my freezer.

379
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:15,802
But only for a week.

380
00:16:15,837 --> 00:16:17,537
Got a lot of ice cream
coming in.

381
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:20,607
Ugh, if this were a movie,
Mother wouldn't let me watch it.

382
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:23,210
Now, I'm afraid it's time
to start your new life.

383
00:16:23,244 --> 00:16:25,412
You'll be hunted,
on the run,

384
00:16:25,446 --> 00:16:27,614
searching for the man
who killed your mother,

385
00:16:27,648 --> 00:16:29,449
which is you.
So avoid mirrors.

386
00:16:30,852 --> 00:16:32,152
(Krusty humming)

387
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:35,956
Krusty, I have
some very bad news.

388
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,258
The foreign Krustys
are all hotter than you.

389
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:41,128
Irish Krusty's
got a show on Broadway.

390
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:42,896
Oi, where's your monkey?

391
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,264
There never was a monkey.

392
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:45,632
I was just tellin' stories

393
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,300
to forget me consumption.

394
00:16:47,335 --> 00:16:48,402
(coughs)

395
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:50,370
(applause)

396
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:51,438
Well, you see there,

397
00:16:51,472 --> 00:16:53,173
they need to hit the
word "monkey" harder

398
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:54,808
if they want
to get a laugh.

399
00:16:54,842 --> 00:16:56,877
Don't you get
what I'm trying to tell you?

400
00:16:56,911 --> 00:16:59,913
You are now the least popular
Krusty in the world.

401
00:16:59,947 --> 00:17:01,915
What about Romanian Krusty?

402
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:04,050
What, you mean
President-for-Life Krusty?

403
00:17:04,085 --> 00:17:05,585
(low groan)

404
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,554
I still get a
piece, right?

405
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:09,456
Putz.
You're the least successful

406
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,091
version of you there is.

407
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,192
A piece.

408
00:17:12,226 --> 00:17:14,895
Now, let's see
where this goes.

409
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:17,597
Irish Krusty, this
is your baby.

410
00:17:17,632 --> 00:17:20,934
The only thing working
round here is your libido.

411
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:23,170
Now I know why Ma
walked into the sea

412
00:17:23,204 --> 00:17:26,173
with her pockets full
of rocks, on Christmas.

413
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:29,609
Why doesn't this
material work for <i>me?</i>

414
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:32,846
Seymour, the cops
are on their way.

415
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,714
(siren wails)

416
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:40,120
Here's a bus ticket
to Juarez and your fake I.D.

417
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:41,521
SKINNER:
Oh, come on,

418
00:17:41,556 --> 00:17:42,923
I don't look anything like this

419
00:17:42,957 --> 00:17:43,957
"Dick Fiddler."

420
00:17:43,991 --> 00:17:45,892
No, you don't... yet.

421
00:17:47,995 --> 00:17:49,296
I don't want to
sound ungrateful,

422
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,097
but could I eat
one of the potatoes?

423
00:17:51,132 --> 00:17:55,001
Sorry, but Dick Fiddler
is allergic to potatoes.

424
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:56,303
I understand.

425
00:17:56,337 --> 00:17:58,872
(both giggling)

426
00:18:03,678 --> 00:18:04,878
Dad?

427
00:18:04,912 --> 00:18:06,613
Thanks for sticking up for me.

428
00:18:06,647 --> 00:18:08,281
(laughs)

429
00:18:08,316 --> 00:18:10,450
Someday I may have
to fake my own death.

430
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:12,385
And maybe you can
help me with that.

431
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,653
Sure, Dad.

432
00:18:13,688 --> 00:18:14,855
Someday soon.

433
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:16,990
As in, what are you
doing this Friday?

434
00:18:18,526 --> 00:18:20,393
Aah! Dick Fiddler!

435
00:18:20,428 --> 00:18:22,796
Gentlemen, I can't
run away from what I've done.

436
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,731
I accept that
I killed my mother.

437
00:18:24,765 --> 00:18:27,167
My whole life,
she's belittled me.

438
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:29,803
Maybe deep down, I'm glad.

439
00:18:29,837 --> 00:18:31,471
This has gone
far enough.

440
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:34,040
I'm starting to think
this "school project"

441
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:35,842
is more than
meets the eye.

442
00:18:35,877 --> 00:18:37,744
Mother?
You're alive?

443
00:18:37,778 --> 00:18:40,480
Seymour, when this
fat guy and his kid

444
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:42,682
asked me to fake my
death to punish you,

445
00:18:42,717 --> 00:18:45,685
I said, "Sure, that's
something to do."

446
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,221
You know, when you
glare like that,

447
00:18:48,256 --> 00:18:50,156
you look really
beautiful.

448
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:51,992
(grumbles):
Mm-hmm.

449
00:18:52,026 --> 00:18:53,693
But when I just
heard you say

450
00:18:53,728 --> 00:18:56,429
you were glad
to see me dead...

451
00:18:56,464 --> 00:18:59,399
I thought, "Now I'm gonna
be meaner to you than ever."

452
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:01,001
How is that possible?

453
00:19:01,035 --> 00:19:04,004
I've stopped taking
those pills that keep me nice.

454
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:05,572

are dissatisfied with
my 75% cut of your take.

462
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:44,472
Well, we did consider
letting you keep more.

I'm very bad in a crisis.

00:20:06,928 --> 00:20:08,429
