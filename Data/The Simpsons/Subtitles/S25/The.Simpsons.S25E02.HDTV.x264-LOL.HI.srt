and... Oh, my God!

175
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:09,427
A box kite! (screams)

176
00:09:11,363 --> 00:09:14,365
(sighs) Well, at least
it's a beautiful night.

177
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,533
(grunts)

178
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:18,836
I'm alive!

179
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:19,971
All patched up!

180
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:21,038
End of story.

181
00:09:21,073 --> 00:09:22,607
Actually, there's
a little more.

182
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:24,342
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

183
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:26,144
I'm sorry.
This was the only way

184
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:27,945
to lengthen Bart's
life for a year

185
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,347
while shortening
yours by 30.

186
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:31,315
I thought I was donating blood.

187
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,018
You are. Along with lymph,
spinal fluid,

188
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:36,554
and all the trimmings.
(chuckles)

189
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:39,190
But, Lisa, your brain is
still in complete control.

190
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:43,294
I could do what
I want to Bart's head?

191
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:44,595
Aw, geez.

192
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,230
Strangle me out
of this, Fatso.

193
00:09:46,265 --> 00:09:47,598
Why you little...!

194
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:50,401
I'll teach you
to make medical history!

195
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:52,904
Oops.

196
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,073
Ah, all good.

197
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:57,074
D'oh!

198
00:09:57,109 --> 00:09:58,075
(neck cracks)

199
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:01,512
(humming)

200
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:02,947
(spits)

201
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:05,149
Hey, boy, since you don't need
a bedroom anymore,

202
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:08,419
I finally get my man cave.

203
00:10:08,454 --> 00:10:10,221
♪ Man cave!

204
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:13,224
♪ Everyone's welcome
to my man cave! ♪

205
00:10:18,997 --> 00:10:21,199
I assure you,
we've spared no effort

206
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:23,000
to accommodate your
special-needs student.

207
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:25,102
And... done.

208
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:28,072
So, in conclusion,
my show-and-tell is...

209
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:29,574
this!

210
00:10:29,608 --> 00:10:32,643
Excellent, Lisa.
A-plus.

211
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:34,045
Bart, your turn.

212
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,882
Well, my show-and-tell is
that I'm on Lisa's body.

213
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,550
Derivative
and repetitive!

214
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:40,585
F-minus.

215
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:42,553
Aw!
(giggles)

216
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:45,623
Bart, I expected more
from a fourth-grade head.

217
00:10:45,657 --> 00:10:47,492
(gasps)

218
00:10:47,526 --> 00:10:50,394
You're rotating it
in the wrong direction!

219
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:53,498
(both grunting)

220
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:56,234
That was gonna be
my show-and-tell!

221
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:58,669
Bart, Lisa,
I'm afraid you two

222
00:10:58,704 --> 00:11:01,339
are going to be together
for a long time.

223
00:11:01,373 --> 00:11:02,893
Why don't you try
to say something good

224
00:11:02,908 --> 00:11:04,609
about each other?

225
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,611
Well, she's pretty
healthy for someone

226
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:07,778
who's been living
with cooties.

227
00:11:07,813 --> 00:11:09,981
Bart, aren't Lisa's ears clean?

228
00:11:10,015 --> 00:11:11,115
Yeah.

229
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:12,884
It's like looking down
a Canadian tunnel.

230
00:11:12,918 --> 00:11:13,885
What else?

231
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,086
Well... now I always

232
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,121
have someone
to eat lunch with.

233
00:11:17,155 --> 00:11:18,723
Great!

234
00:11:18,757 --> 00:11:21,125
That's as much therapy
as your parents can afford.

235
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:25,263
I think we've made
some progress here.

236
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:26,264
Great...

237
00:11:26,298 --> 00:11:27,465
Oh, and I have this

238
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:29,133
"two heads for one" coupon.

239
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:30,167
Well, that's for lettuce.

240
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:31,369
How about this one?

241
00:11:31,403 --> 00:11:32,703
"One random disorder free

242
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:34,272
with every schizophrenia."

243
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:35,673
That's mine,
but it's expired.

244
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:37,341
D'oh!

245
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:39,644
(playing "When the Saints
Go Marching In")

246
00:11:44,349 --> 00:11:47,018
Should've chopped off
Bart's head long ago.

247
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:51,088
Sleep well, Lis.

248
00:11:51,123 --> 00:11:52,790
Somehow, sewing my head
on your shoulder

249
00:11:52,824 --> 00:11:54,292
brought us
closer together.

250
00:11:54,326 --> 00:11:55,660
Rainbow...

251
00:11:55,694 --> 00:11:56,827
oh, Rainbow...

252
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:59,330
Oh... not the pony
dream again.

253
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:03,334
(gasps)
Hey, <i>I</i> did that.

254
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,337
Yep, that's me.

255
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:08,005
When she's asleep,

256
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,407
I'm in control.

257
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:11,542
Lis, I'm gonna make sure

258
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:13,778
you stay asleep.

259
00:12:13,812 --> 00:12:15,947
(laughs evilly)

260
00:12:20,218 --> 00:12:21,919
Ooh, mix-ins!

261
00:12:23,922 --> 00:12:24,889
Mmm.

262
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:26,557
(snores)

263
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:27,725
(falls down stairs,
grunts, shouts)

264
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,226
Son of a...

265
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:30,494

266
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:31,529

267
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:37,201
(engine sputters, dies)

268
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:40,171
You start a car as well
as you start a family.

269
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:42,707
You wait here while I go
get the jumper cables.

270
00:12:45,477 --> 00:12:47,979
MRS. SKINNER:
Oh, a panic attack, huh?

271
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:50,548
Well, I'll give you something
to panic about!

272
00:12:50,582 --> 00:12:51,716
(grunting)

273
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,151
(groans)

274
00:12:55,654 --> 00:12:57,321
Now I'll just cut off
her annoying head

275
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:58,990
and this body will be all mine.

276
00:12:59,024 --> 00:13:00,391
Or we both die.

277
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:02,360
Not really sure
what the rules are.

278
00:13:02,394 --> 00:13:03,361
(gasps)

279
00:13:03,395 --> 00:13:04,729
Why, Bart?

280
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,497
I thought we
were friends.

281
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:08,733
A brother can never
be friends with his sister.

282
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,568
Are you really,
really sure?

283
00:13:10,602 --> 00:13:11,802
I'm afraid I am.

284
00:13:11,837 --> 00:13:13,938
Well, then, I guess
I have no choice.

285
00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:15,406
(yells)

286
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,241
How could this
go wrong?

287
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:18,676
'Cause in a

Well, wherever I am,

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,387
it's gotta be an improvement.

293
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:30,821
Guess again.

294
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:31,889

00:15:46,952 --> 00:15:48,286
Good day!

357
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,321
(grunts)

358
00:15:52,658 --> 00:15:53,891
All of you!

359
00:15:53,926 --> 00:15:55,560
Get back out there
with your flippers flapping,

360
00:15:55,594 --> 00:15:56,894
and your stumps a-stumping!

361
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:58,129
Joe and Jane normal

362
00:15:58,163 --> 00:15:59,797
expect some entertainment
for their nickel!

363
00:15:59,832 --> 00:16:01,299
Mr. Burnsum!

364
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,268
You should treat these
poor people with respect!

365
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:06,237
Marge! Get away
from those freaks.

366
00:16:06,271 --> 00:16:07,638
You belong to me!

367
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:09,741
The dumb, hairless brute.

368
00:16:09,775 --> 00:16:13,277
Well, you are the best
this circus has to offer.

369
00:16:13,312 --> 00:16:15,413
(laughing)

370
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:17,782
Taste the strength
of your fiancé.

371
00:16:19,785 --> 00:16:22,020
Ooh!

372
00:16:22,054 --> 00:16:23,654
Ooh...

373
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:25,890
With the mighty tongue
God's given you,

374
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:29,494
why can't you speak kindly
of these imperfect angels?

375
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:32,430
Marge, they knew
what they were getting into

376
00:16:32,464 --> 00:16:34,832
when their parents sold them
to the circus.

377
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:36,367
Enough!
You will comport yourself

378
00:16:36,402 --> 00:16:37,468
with the dignity expected

379
00:16:37,503 --> 00:16:39,704
of a traveling freak show.

380
00:16:39,738 --> 00:16:40,738
(grunts)

381
00:16:42,808 --> 00:16:44,075
Excuse me, ma'am,

382
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:47,145
but, uh, I ain't never seen
a normal stand up for us.

383
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:48,179
(sighs)

384
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:50,214
I, too, am a freak.

385
00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:51,215
One eye is blue,

386
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,117
and the other
a pale brown.

387
00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:55,520
I wouldn't want to
be you, lady.

388
00:16:55,554 --> 00:16:57,855
Never give up hope,
my friends.

389
00:17:00,325 --> 00:17:02,794
Of all the kisses
I have ever gotten in my life,

390
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:04,295
that was the first.

391
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,130
Hey, you should
ask her out, Moe.

392
00:17:06,165 --> 00:17:08,633
Ah, but she's sweet
on the strong man.

393
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,868
You're fine unless
Rabbit Ears hears

394
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:12,437
and tells Big Mouth.

395
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:14,405
(whispering)

396
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,541
Wha...?!

397
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:19,377
I ain't got no chance
with the strong man's girl.

398
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:20,878
He makes ten dollars a week

399
00:17:20,913 --> 00:17:22,480
plus all the sawdust he can eat.

400
00:17:22,514 --> 00:17:24,148
Well, you've got
an emerald ring.

401
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:26,851
My mother's ring.

402
00:17:26,885 --> 00:17:27,852
(sobs)

403
00:17:27,886 --> 00:17:29,821
She gave it to me
on her deathbed.

404
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,856
She also acquired it
on her deathbed.

405
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,724
That was a very busy deathbed.

406
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,359
With an emerald that big,

407
00:17:35,394 --> 00:17:36,861
I could buy anything.

408
00:17:36,895 --> 00:17:38,729
A jalopy, an icebox,

409
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:40,898
a steamer trunk full of fedoras!

410
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:43,401
But how do I get my hands on it?

411
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:45,002
Oh, I'm an idiot!

412
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:46,003
Of course!

413
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:47,371
I get Marge to marry Moe,

414
00:17:47,406 --> 00:17:48,473
then I kill Moe,

415
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:49,607
then she gets the ring,

416
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:51,275
then I marry her
and the ring is mine.

417
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,145
And the brilliance of my plan
is its simplicity.

418
00:17:55,314 --> 00:17:57,782
You're gonna be sorry
you said that.

419
00:17:57,816 --> 00:18:01,119
<i>You're</i> gonna be sorry
you said that.

420
00:18:01,153 --> 00:18:02,854
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

421
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:06,624
whoa, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh...

422
00:18:06,658 --> 00:18:08,693
I just lost my keys!

423
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:10,428
Whoa-whoa-whoa...

424
00:18:10,462 --> 00:18:13,397
What do you know?
I <i>am</i> gathering moss!

425
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:14,732
(owl hoots)

426
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:17,135
Hey, Marge, you want
to marry Moe?

427
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:19,504
I'm engaged
to you, my love.

428
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:22,106
The poor, lonely fellow
is about to die.

429
00:18:22,141 --> 00:18:23,508
Really? How?

430
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:25,409
Well, let me
worry about how.

431
00:18:25,444 --> 00:18:28,246
But you know, you could make
his last day a happy one.

432
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,548
And the ring is just
the icing on the cake.

433
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:31,749
What ring?

434
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:34,585
The ring that'll get me
out of this lousy circus

435
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,154
and into a good circus.

436
00:18:36,188 --> 00:18:37,421
Now, let's get you married.

437
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:39,524
But wouldn't you
be jealous, my love?

438
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:42,059
(laughs) Dear, I am not
the jealous type.

439
00:18:42,094 --> 00:18:44,061
And from you,
I have learned

440
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:47,298
to feel compassion
for these disgustos.

441
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:48,766
Aw...

442
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,303
(solemnly):
♪ She's a superfreak

443
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:54,438
♪ Superfreak

444
00:18:54,473 --> 00:18:57,441
♪ She's superfreaky

445
00:18:57,476 --> 00:18:59,010
♪ Yow.

446
00:18:59,044 --> 00:19:00,178
"Yow" indeed.

447
00:19:00,212 --> 00:19:01,312
And so, with the conclusion

448
00:19:01,346 --> 00:19:02,647
of our traditional wedding song,

449
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:04,182
I now declare you

450
00:19:04,216 --> 00:19:05,616
husband and wife.

451
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:08,553
Moe, whatever small time
together we have

452
00:19:08,587 --> 00:19:10,788
will be wonderful.

453
00:19:10,822 --> 00:19:11,923
(laughs)

454
00:19:11,957 --> 00:19:13,491
A very small time!

455
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:15,359
Those are strange
things to say,

456
00:19:15,394 --> 00:19:17,929
but a wedding is no place
to worry about threats

457
00:19:17,963 --> 00:19:19,630
from the bride's former lover.

458
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:20,965
Now, the toast.

459
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:22,266
To you, Marge.

460
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:23,868
Now you are
one of us.

461
00:19:23,902 --> 00:19:25,636
FREAKS (chanting):
One of us!

462
00:19:25,671 --> 00:19:27,638
Gooble goo!

463
00:19:27,673 --> 00:19:29,707
One of us!

464
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:31,375
Gooble goo!

465
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,811
Why is it company parties
always get weird?

466
00:19:33,845 --> 00:19:35,146
(cork pops)

467
00:19:36,448 --> 00:19:37,548
God, you are
so beautiful

468
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:38,783
in that
peignoir there.

469
00:19:38,817 --> 00:19:41,152
I, uh, better
freshen up a little bit.

470
00:19:42,854 --> 00:19:44,121
(humming)

471
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:45,556
Set it to "massage," Jumbo.

472
00:19:47,025 --> 00:19:49,660
(humming)

473
00:19:51,096 --> 00:19:52,830
Hmm? What
are you doing?

474
00:19:52,864 --> 00:19:55,199
Oh! Trying
to kill Moe

475
00:19:55,234 --> 00:19:57,034
so we'll get
his emerald!

476
00:19:57,069 --> 00:19:58,302
By the way,
I haven't checked,

477
00:19:58,337 --> 00:19:59,570
but emeralds
are valuable, right?

478
00:19:59,605 --> 00:20:00,605
(gasps)

479
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,139
Strong Man!

480
00:20:02,174 --> 00:20:04,475
Moe may be ugly
on the outside,

481
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:07,745
but inside, you are
the true monster.

482
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,680
Leave my trailer forever!

483
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:11,082
<i>You're</i> rejecting <i>me?</i>

484
00:20:11,116 --> 00:20:15,419
But I'm in the best shape
anyone is in the 1930s.

485
00:20:15,454 --> 00:20:16,754
I said go!

486
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:18,022

487
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:22,360

00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,830
Gooble goo!

491
00:20:25,864 --> 00:20:27,765
What the hell does
"gooble goo" mean?

492
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:28,966
(chanting):
We don't know!

493
00:20:29,001 --> 00:20:30,034
Gooble goo!

494
00:20:30,068 --> 00:20:31,235

Gooble goo!

(gasps)

497
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:36,641
You killed Burnsum!

498
00:20:36,675 --> 00:20:38,909
Now who is gonna say,
"Step right up"?

Gooble goo! Gooble goo!

Tar and
feather him!

501
00:20:42,814 --> 00:20:45,049
Tear off his drumsticks!

502
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,184
Make him...
one of us!

This is exactly why

00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:52,690
circus attendance is plummeting!

506
00:20:52,724 --> 00:20:56,594
And that, kids, is
how I met your mother.
