unrepress it?

to use my Yaqui tea set.

coming back to you?

There have been so many
classic Simpson moments.

183
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:23,038
I remember that time
I tried to jump
over Springfield Gorge.

sick of that memory.

back when you were 12.

187

must have happened.

188

I used to go hiking a lot

still be out there.

348
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,492
I'm afraid that skull
belongs to my dear friend,

349
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,911
Waylon Smithers Senior.

350
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:44,080
(GASPS)
Mr. Smithers' father!

351
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,208
But I did not murder him.

352
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,587
And I can prove it

353
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,464
with this film.

354
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,383
Ooh! A movie!
I call the couch!

355
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,593
(LAUGHING)

356
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,222
If you see only
one film this year that
proves my innocence,

357
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,681
make it this one.

358
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,060
(ALARM BLARING)

359
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,520
Why are these
numbers so high?

360
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,188
Why is that
red light flashing?

361
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,773
And what's that
alarming sound?

362
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,400
Smithers, get in here!
Smithers!

363
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,695
Sorry, Monty.
I was feeding Waylon Junior.

364
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,697
Will you put
that baby down?

365
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,867
There's something wrong
with the reactor core.

366
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:23,745
(ELECTRICAL BUZZING)

367
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,122
I better go in
and have a look.

368
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,541
No, Waylon Senior.

369
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,459
It could be filled
with atoms, and steam,

370
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,169
and other
nuclear bric-a-brac.

371
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:34,089
If this reactor blows,
the whole town is doomed,

372
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,841
including my son.

373
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,095
(GURGLING)

374
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,974
So, you're a baby, huh?
How's that
working out for you?

375
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,267
(POWERING DOWN)

376
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,810
He did it!

377
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,020
Look at your
heroic daddy in there

378
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,023
making funny faces,
falling to the floor,

379
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,652
shedding his hair,
lying perfectly still...

380
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,321
Oh, dear.

381
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,781
Sir.

382
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:08,248
Smithers Senior gave his life
to save the plant.

383
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,375
And since cover-ups
were all the rage back then,

384
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,086
I shoved his heroic corpse
down the sewer pipe.

385
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,964
I never told Smithers
the truth about his father.

386
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,966
Until tonight, sir.

387
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,969
(GASPS)
Smithers Junior.

388
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,470
Ha! Busted.

389
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,891
Now the movie's
turned into a play.
Still good though.

390
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,726
I'm sorry
I lied to you, Waylon.

391
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,770
But I wanted to spare you
the details of your
father's gruesome death.

392
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,983
Well, I'm glad to know
he died a hero
instead of that other way.

393
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:39,905
I told him his father
was killed in the Amazon
by a tribe of savage women.

394
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,740
I hope it didn't
affect you in any way.

395
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,325
We'll never know, sir.

396
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,165
Well, Marge, we solved
the case of
the haunted quarry.

397
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,586
Homer, shouldn't we
give that skull
to Mr. Smithers?

398
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,421
Why? He'd just bury it.

399
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,759
Hey! Hey! I found a clue
that's gonna bust
your mystery wide open.

400
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,802
Sorry.
We already solved it.

401
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:03,887
Oh.

402
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:08,266
Well, you want
to take a look at it
anyways just for ha-ha's?

403
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,935
Seems kind of pointless now.

404
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,519
Yeah, I guess you're right.

405
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,438
It's just that, you know,
I went to a lot of trouble,

406
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,274
you know,
making the envelope
and everything.

407
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,610
Let's see
what you have, Moe.

408
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,778
Okay.

409
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,155
Now this first thing
is just gonna look
like a used Band-Aid,

410
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,281
and it is.

411
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,992
But the rest of the stuff
don't make no sense
without it.

412
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,619
So, you know,
bear with me.

413
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,581
Wow, Moe.
You've been doing
a lot of sleuthing.

414
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,168
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I sleuthed my ass off
on this one.

415
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,296
Okay, this is a number six
from somebody's address.

416
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,591
Or is it a nine?
You don't know.

417
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:45,261
This is gravel.
Okay? Gravel.

418
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:45,971
This is...
That's more gravel.
Okay. Oh!

419
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,765
This is...
That's more gravel.
Okay. Oh!

420
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:53,853
This is a shell that, to me,
this is just me talking.

421
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,855
It looks like
a helmet for a mouse.

422
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,650
Now, that sounds crazy, right?

423
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:02,946
But if you ask
the mice about it,
they don't say nothing.

424
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,990
I mean,
they run the other way.

425
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,659
At first, I was just fishing
with the helmet thing.

426
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,745
But then from
the mouse reaction I got,

427
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,165
I got a little
more concerned.

428
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,752
HOMER: You really made
that envelope?

429
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,088
'Cause it says
"Hammermill" over here.

430
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,800
MOE: Um... No.

431
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,265
