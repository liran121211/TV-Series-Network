D'oh!

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,096
(tires screeching)

5
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,694
Now, the topic
for your research paper

6
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,029
will be World War I.

7
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,031
Was that the war
with Hitler or Merlin?

8
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,992
Oh, you idiot.
Merlin was in Vietnam.

9
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,995
Instead of writing a report,
can I do a dance?

10
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,955
(singing a tune)

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,540
(grunts)

12
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,375
Sorry.

13
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,835
May I type my report?

14
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,754
It'll be easier
on teacher's eyes.

15
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,673
Yes. In fact, why doesn't
everyone type their paper?

16
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:49,966
Great idea, Martin.

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,844
Can the paper
be ten pages minimum?

18
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,763
Well, I was going
to say five, but OK.

19
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,306
Thanks again, Martin.

20
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,432
Martin?

21
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,020
He's gone now.

22
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,813
But you got
to admire his spirit.

23
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,859
All right, Seymour,

24
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,528
I'm ready for our romantic
apple-picking trip.

25
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,113
Yes, about that.

26
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,783
Mother's neck wattle
got caught in a zipper.

27
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,619
I've, uh... got a long night
of boo-boo kissing ahead of me,

28
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,580
but don't worry, I got you these
store-bought apples instead.

29
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,290
The apples weren't the point.

30
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,792
(chuckling)

31
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,919
Then why were
we going apple picking?

32
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,003
(sighing)

33
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,088
BART: OK...

34
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,923
time to start this paper.

35
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,549
(sighs)

36
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,134
World War I.

37
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,053
W.W.I.

38
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,679
Eh, that's a good start.

39
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,056
Time to watch wrestling.

OK, got to focus, got to focus.

50
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,913
Got to look at that bird.

51
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,666
Got to focus.

54
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,297
Why did I pay for 100 Xeroxes
when I only wanted one?

55
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,717
Well, I guess someone else
will use the other 99.

What should I do, Lord?

60
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,650
Give me a sign.

I'll just do a few equations.

No. No more distractions.

78
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,034
Hey, Bart, want to go for a ride

79
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,077
in my uncle's
Black Hawk helicopter?

80
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,163
But I just started my paper.

81
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,789
It's your last chance.

82
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,042
He's probably going to get
court-martialed for this.

83
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,376
Black Hawk up.

00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,464

92
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:01,991
Grandpa, quick,

93
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,910
tell me everything you know
about World War I.

94
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,496
World War I? I fought in that.

95
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,999
'Course, to enlist,
I had to lie about my age.

96
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,632
(young Grampa):
Want to see my picture I drew?

97
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,634
Lieutenant Simpson,
you've been up for hours.

98
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,886
Take a nap.
You're no good to us cranky.

99
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,972
But I'm not tired.

100
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,891
(crying)

101
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,063
Oh, this is great stuff.

102
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,982
I can pad it out to ten pages.

103
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,066
Goodnight, Grandpa.

104
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,777
But I'm not tired.

105
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,445
Goodnight, sleepyhead.

106
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,738
Do you have to poop?

107
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,073
Always.

108
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,409
"F"? There must be some mistake.

109
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,077
It's as long as you asked for.

110
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,870
Counting six pages of ads.

111
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,291
You're going to have to redo
your paper after class.

112
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,127
Well, if I may dust off
an old chestnut...

113
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,712
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

114
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,631
<i>Ay, caramba </i>indeed.

115
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:03,261
And so on November 11th, 1918,

116
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,764
the guns fell silent
and peace returned.

117
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,224
The End.

118
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,892
Very good, Bart.

119
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,229
Oh, I must have
the wrong classroom.

120
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,981
I was looking for my girlfriend,

121
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,316
not Pam Dawber.

122
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,692
(both chuckling)

123
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,695
Are you ready for a little
after school special?

124
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,323
Eyes front, Simpson.

125
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,657
(cell phone ringing)

126
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,200
Hello. Mother?

127
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,535
(groaning)

128
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,870
I'll be right there.

129
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,497
Now she wants
to get out of the tub.

130
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,875
You've got to stop
putting your mother ahead of me.

131
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,126
We have a date.

132
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,836
I'll be back in three hours.

133
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,296
Maybe less.

134
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,839
But almost certainly more.

135
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,592
-(grunts)
-(door closes)

136
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,635
(crying)

137
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,554
He's a wiener, Mrs. K.

138
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,973
Just say the word, and his desk
is full of boogers.

139
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,600
(crying)

140
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,809
That's sweet of you,

141
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:56,022
but if I lost Seymour,
who else is there?

142
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,901
<i>♪ I believe in miracles ♪</i>

143
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,906

<i>you sexy thing? ♪</i>

00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,574
<i>♪ Sexy thing, you... ♪</i>

145
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,827
OK, there's a lot of low cards
in that hand.

146
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,162
But, since we're both free,

147
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,747
why don't you and me
hit the town?

148
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,583
A pity date from a ten-year-old?

149
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,335
(sighs) I'll take it.

150
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,929
RAINIER: From the widest gully
to the deepest trench,

151
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:31,933
holes define who we are
and where we're going.

152
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,519
And, although Rover here
may not know it,

153
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:38,314
he is participating in a ritual
as old as time itself.

154
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,109
He is giving birth to a hole.

155
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,403
<i>Or, consider the dolphin,</i>

156
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,114
<i>nature's most filmed creature.</i>

157
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,949
<i>Even they have holes--</i>

158
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,492
<i>blowholes.</i>

159
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,286
Thanks for going out
with me tonight.

160
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,456
It really took my mind off
stupid jerks.

161
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,666
And their mothers.

162
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,756
(sighs)

163
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,882
BART: And did you know

164
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,718
the hole's only natural
enemy is the pile?

165
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,721
I can't believe you went
to the movies with a teacher.

166
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,140
What happened
to the Bart Simpson

167
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,559
who put the mothballs
in the beef stew?

168
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,768
Hey, I only hung out
with Krabappel

169
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,437
because Skinner blew her off.

170
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,272
I've never seen her so sad.

171
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,941
You know what made me feel
better about myself?

172
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:25,653
That award I got
for World's Greatest Dad.

173
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,737
(slurping)

174
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,406
Dad, you bought that

175
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,324
because it was
full of gummy worms.

176
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,411
And you only wanted those
as bait to catch gummy fish.

177
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,912
Which I did.

178
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,122
(chair moves)

179
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,502
Mm! Trophy.

180
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,130
Hey, Bart, you could
nominate Mrs. Krabappel

181
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,716
for an actual award,
The Teacher of the Year.

182
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,301
Then she'll feel appreciated.

183
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,011
They have an award for teaching?

184
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,263
Hey, they have Latin Grammys.

185
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,146
It is so hard to choose nominees

186
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,148
from all these
qualified candidates.

187
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,776
This is the most difficult
one-day-a-year job in the world.

188
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,153
Put in the next tape.

189
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,698
<i>I use humor</i>
<i>to reach my students.</i>

190
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,782

191
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,868
<i>Dead Poets Society </i>has destroyed

192
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,328
a generation of educators.

193
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,288
(laughing)

194
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,415
And so President Kennedy
says to Khrushchev,

195
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,791
"Well, enough jawin'.

196
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,460
Reach for it, pilgrim."

197
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,711
And the missiles are, like,

198
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,588
"Oh, praise Jesus!

199
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,839
Can I hear an 'Amen'?"

200

202
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,345
<i>I'd like to nominate</i>

203
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,472

207
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,897
(gasping) The Bart Simpson?

208
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,524
I thought he was just
an urban legend.

209
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,361
If she's danced with the devil
in the blue shorts and lived,

210
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,488
we have ourselves a nominee.

211
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,697
(all) Mm-hmm.

212
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,368
Oh, Lord it's only Wednesday.

213
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,746
I hope one of those little hoods
puts a tack on my chair

214
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,165
just so I can feel something.

215
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,291
(horn blowing and cheering)

216
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,501
What's going on?

217
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,670
Edna Krabappel,
you've been nominated

218
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,129
for Teacher of the Year.

219
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,131
(cheering)

220
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,508
Oh, my God.

221
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,801
(crying)

222
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,843
NELSON: Ha-ha!

223
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,178
You're crying.

224
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,180
Nelson Muntz,
you've been nominated

225
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,974
for Bully of the Year.

226
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,893
Thank you so much.

227
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,020
(crying)

228
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,188
Wedgie!

229
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,815
(grunting)

230
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,069
How does it feel to be nominated

231
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,195
for "Teacher of The Year"?

232
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,656
(laughs) I can't believe it.

233
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,575
This after I accidentally showed

234
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,785
the R-rated <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

235
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,413
I thought that nipple
would haunt me forever.

236
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:44,917
Oh, Reporter Cletus,
<i>Outhouse Times-Picayune.</i>

237
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,878
Is there any persons,
critters or spells

238
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,423
to which you attribute
this accolade?

239
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,800
There's one person
I'd like to thank for this.

240
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,052
Hmm. Hmm.

241
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,554
We've had our ups and downs,

242
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,889
but I can't imagine
life without him--

243
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,349
Bart Simpson.

244
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,892

245
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,854
MAN: Way to go, Bart!

246
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,982
I can't express
how I feel in words

247
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,442
so I drew this picture.

248
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,403
These stink lines stand
for dedication, caring,

249
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,488
and for letting me
drink coffee in class.

250
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,740
Way to go, Edna.

251
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:16,866
(all cheering)

252
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,284
-Yes, yes!
-Way to go!

253
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,910
Oh, oh. Follow-up query.

254
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:23,289
Mrs. K, if you win
this here learning derby,

255
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,541
will you forget
your kith and kin

256
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,501
and leave us all forever?

257
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,920
Leave us forever?

258
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,632
I'd better pee on this fire.

259
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,758
(microphone feeds back)

260
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,135
As principal, I'd just like
to say a few words

261
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:40,056
about what this wonderful woman
means to this school

262
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,265
and to me.

263
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,935
Webster's Dictionary
defines Mrs. Krabappel as...

264
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,938
(pager plays Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony)

265
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,816
Excuse me. I have
an emergency page from Mother.

266
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,861
This press conference is over.

267
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,323
(groans)

268
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,408
So, because I nominated Mrs. K,

269
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,826
our whole family
gets a free trip

270
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,828
to the awards ceremony
in Orlando.

271
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,913
Orlando?

272
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,373
Are we going to Sea World?

273
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,832
-No.
-Disney World?

274
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,584
-Uh-uh.
-Universal Studios?

275
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,544
-'Fraid not.
-Leisure World?

276
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,796
Sorry, Grampa.

277
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,422
-Gator Gulch?
-You wish.

278
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,924
Leisure World?

279
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,884
Grampa, you're not even going.

280
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,553
Wait a minute.
I know where we're going.

281
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,681
Oh, it's horrible!

282
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,103
Oh, it's even boring
to fly over it.

283
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,522
(sobbing)

284
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,108
Oh, God!

285
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,154
It's so exciting.

286
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,823
I'm meeting my peers.

287
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,783
Ooh, the FutureSphere.

288
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,452
It's what
people in 1965 imagined

289
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,496
what life would be like in 1987.

Bring me some ice!

00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,757
My fanny is baboon-red
after that car ride.

345
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,761
Ow! Mother, we were sharing
an open-mouthed kiss.

346
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,096
You brought your mother?

347
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,806
(nervous laughter)
Well, technically,

348
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,474
since she's paying for the room,

349
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,018
she brought me.

350
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,562
I am tired of sharing you
with your mother.

351
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:00,566
This woman carried me
for nine and a half months.

352
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,235
I was out for two weeks,
then went back in.

353
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,533
Hey, Skinner, do you and Edna
want to join Marge and me

355
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,371
I believe the only venue for me

356
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,041
is the ride of broken dreams.

357
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,376
Oh, you mean the Enron ride.

(all screaming)

360
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,554
MAN: We broke even.

361
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,431
(all screaming)

362
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,850
(all groan)

363
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,602
MAN: Mm! That's good satire.

364
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,944
(gasps) Mom...

365
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,445
is that Principal Skinner

366
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,155
sleeping in the bed of tomorrow?

367
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,951
(mechanical voice):
<i>Rise and shine, sleepyhead.</i>

368
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,496
<i>You'll be late for the next</i>
<i>rocket to the moon.</i>

369
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,874
He's never going to get up.

370
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,959
He's got no legs.

371
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,418
What are you doing here?

372
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,878
Hmm. Well, since Edna dumped me,

373
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,381
I've been wandering
around this park all night.

374
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,884
It's educational
and offers mild thrills--

375
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,761
just like Edna.

376
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,054
Now, before the show,

377
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,847
you'll need to take urine tests

378
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,433
to prove you're not taking
teaching-enhancing drugs.

379
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,893
(crazed laugh)

380
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,104
You can't test what's not there!

381
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,899
We're also pleased to announce

382
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,901
that our winner will receive
enough money

383
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,903
so they'll never have
to teach again.

384
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,239
(cheering)

385
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,117
Good Lord, I may lose
Edna forever.

386
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,910
I've got to stop her
from winning.

387
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,705
Then she'll be broken,
miserable and mine.

388
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,707
(indistinct noise)

389
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,835
Don't look back.

390
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,378
Just keep driving.

391
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,213
Seymour? Glad you're here.

392
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,007
You can help me play
"Halloween Hit and Run."

393
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,260
-(screams)
-(grunts)

394
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,845
Ooh, this game is going to get

395
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,388
some disapproving clucks.

396
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,224
But, for now, I need
my tongue to talk to you.

397
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,685
I don't want to lose Edna,

398
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:03,814
so I need you to sabotage
her chances of winning tonight.

399
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,691
But I don't want to hurt Mrs. K.

400
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:09,028
All right, Bart, I didn't want
to resort to this, but...

401
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,946
this drawing was found
on the wall

402
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,323
of Springfield Elementary
late last week.

403
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,950
All right, I'm in.

404
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,161
I'll humiliate
the love of your life.

405
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,746
Because I like you

406
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,330
I'll even do it pro boner.

407
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,415
That's pro bono.

408
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,791
I know what I said.

409
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,753
Hmm. This is the worst thing
I've ever done.

410
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,338
Even worse than
what I did in 'Nam.

411
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,008
(mid-'60s rock playing)

412
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,263
You're going to get
your parade...

413
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,681
down my esophagus.

414
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,560
(deep sigh)

415
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,563
So many categories.

416
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,983
Gym Teacher of the Year,
Substitute Teacher of the Year,

417
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,611
Most Wheelchair-Accessible
School award?

418
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:54,198
Oh, who will take home
the Rampy?

419
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,993
ANNOUNCER: <i>And now,</i>
<i>to present our final award</i>

420
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,995
<i>for Teacher of the Year,</i>

421
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,330
<i>Little Richard.</i>

422
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,290
I love teachers.

423
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,417
In fact, I'm a teacher.

424
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,170
I taught Paul McCartney
to go (sing-song voice) Whoo!

425
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,755
"Purple Rain."

426
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,090
Shut up!

427
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,093
Michael Jackson
just told me to shut up.

428
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,597
We're down to our
last three teachers, folks,

429
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,017
and the winner will be
decided by one final question

430
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,686
asked by the students
who nominated them.

431
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,188
(applause)

432
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,150
SKINNER: <i>I feel terrible</i>

433
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,402
<i>but this is the only way</i>
<i>I can win Edna</i>

434
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,904
<i>without upsetting Mother.</i>

435
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,784
MRS. SKINNER: <i>He has</i>
<i>the tiny hands of a chimp.</i>

436
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,702
And now Bart Simpson

437
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,788
will ask a question
to his teacher.

438
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,376
"W... wha... at...

439
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,669
"Wa...

440
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,920
Wo..."

441
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,046
Hurry up, son.

442
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,590
I'm sorry. I can't read.

443
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,718
Mrs. Krabappel never
taught me to read.

444
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,053
(all gasping)

445
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,513
Is this true, Edna?

446
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,931
(dejected sigh)

447
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,517
Oh, God, I've created
a Prankenstein.

448
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,728
Wait. That boy is lying.
He's not illiterate.

449
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,273
And he's good around
the potty, too.

450
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,316
I'm sorry, everyone.

451
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,569
I perpetrated this charade.

452
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,570
(groans)

453
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,612
The boy can read,

454
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,072
and Edna Krabappel
is the greatest teacher

455
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,991
-I have ever known.
-(gasps)

456
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,784
If she can teach me to love,

457
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,161
then she can teach anything.

458
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,662
ALL: Ah!

459
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,539
MRS. SKINNER: Seymour!

460
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,083
Your feelings are
ugly and wrong.

461
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,335
Are you going to listen to her?

462
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,503
Not on your life, Reverend.

463
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,297
From now on, I'm my own man.

464
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,841
I have waited to hear
that for so long.

465
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:36,967
And it gets better.

466
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,844
Edna Krabappel...

467
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,512
will you marry me?

468
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,764
-(gasps)
-Now, I must warn you,

469
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,392
two months salary
only bought me the ring box.

470
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,352
Oh, here, honey,
take one of mine.

471
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,645
(sing-song voice) Whoo!

472
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,566
Oh, I felt naked there
for a minute.

473
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,154
(gasps)

474
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,866
Seymour, of course
I'll marry you.

475
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,327
Oh, great.

476
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,912
Three in a bed.

477
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,330
Since the show is running long,

478
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,539
we'll just go ahead
and name a winner.

479
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,665
(chanting): Edna...

480
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,917
Edna...

481
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,002
Julio Estudiante--

482
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,795
an inner-city math teacher

483
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,797
who taught teenage gang members

484
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,299
that differential equations

485
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,343
are more powerful than bullets.

486
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,636
What a rip!

487
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,346
You all should be ashamed!

488
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,016
Well, I didn't win
Teacher of the Year,

489
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,143
but I didn't go home
empty-handed.

490
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,937
Do you want to check out

491
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,189
the bed of tomorrow... today?

492
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,815
Oh, Seymour.

493
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,317
(chuckling)

494
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,361
I love happy endings.

495
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,904
Well, here's ours.

496
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,073
We're going to Disney World!

497
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,867
(grunting)

498
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,619
(sirens wailing)

499
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,996
(voice over bullhorn):
<i>Step away from the wall.</i>

500
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,498
<i>Step away from the wall.</i>

501
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,668
Oh, it's so beautiful.

502
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,503
(grunts)

503
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,213
HOMER: One churro, please.

504
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,714
MAN: That'll be $14.

505
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,383
(Homer screaming and crying)

506
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:02,970
Here.

507
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,932
<i>♪ Ba, ba, ba, ba-ba-ba ♪</i>

508
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,935
<i>♪ Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba... ♪</i>

509
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,853
Boy those pies look good.

510
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,939
Open your gullet,
you human blob.

511
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,858
Well, what do you think?

512
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,568
(lively musical intro)

513
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,487
What do I think of the pie?

514
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,406
What do I think of the pie?

515
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,324
<i>♪ Goodness gracious</i>
<i>it's delicious ♪</i>

516
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,493
<i>♪ That's what I think</i>

517
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,036
<i>♪ Because... ♪</i>

518
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,332
Should we follow him?

519
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,710
I'm on vacation.

520
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,934
-(murmuring)
-Shh!
