00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,043
(theme music playing)

2
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:06,548
CHORUS: <i>The Simpsons</i>

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,218
D'oh! (screams)

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,264
ALL: (shouting and grunting)

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,974
(sharks growling)

6
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,573
-Hi, Moe. Got any beer?
-Sure. Check in the fridge.

7
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,160
Wait a minute, I'm at work.
You gotta pay for it.

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,330
What the...? Where's my money?

9
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,625
<i>MARGE: Dear Homie, had to buy</i>
<i>diapers for Maggie. Love, Marge.</i>

10
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,669
-Wha...?
<i>-MARGE: Simpson.</i>

11
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,087
Oh.

12
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,882
<i>LISA: Dear Dad, took money</i>
<i>for the school book fair.</i>

13
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,551
<i>BART: Homer, I need cash</i>
<i>or they're gonna break my legs.</i>

14
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,761
Sorry, Homer.

15
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,180
So you're gonna let me
walk out of here sober?

16
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,306
I'm afraid so.

17
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,058
-And you can live with that?
-Ya-huh.

18
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,603
Fine. There are plenty other ways for me
to alter my consciousness.

19
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,653
Oh, yeah.

20
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:17,035
Are you gonna buy those toads
or just lick them?

21
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,745
Lick them. Go away.

22
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,331
Ah.

23
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,209
Thanks for the donation,
Mr. Simpson. Do you feel OK?

24
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,712
Jewish? Oh, no, I'm not Jewish.

25
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,839
(laughing)

26
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:35,470
Wait till Moe sees
how wasted I got without him.

27
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,888
He's gonna plotz.

28
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,349
You wouldn't serve Homer just 'cause
he didn't have money?

29
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,936
What happened to you, Moe?
You used to be about the booze.

30
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:47,065
Oh, yeah. I guess I got caught
up in all the glitz and glamor.

31
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,483
(squeaks)

32
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,693
(hums)

33
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,447
-Well, Moe.
-Homer, I'm so sorry. Have a free beer.

34
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,532
Oh.

35
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:01,663
Uh, I don't care about the
color of your skin, Lenny.

36
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:05,166
You're my friend. (chuckles)

37
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,460
Man, I've never seen anybody
get loaded so fast.

38
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,420
Homer, can you say the alphabet backwards?

39
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,132
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you? You...

40
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,718
-Hey, I'm worried.
-I've had just about enough of you.

41
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,138
-Oh, yeah?
-Uh-huh.

42
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,932
-Oh, rats.
-I'm out of here.

43
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,935
We can't let our friend drive
like this. I'm liable here.

44
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,479
-Uh...?
-Get his keys.

45
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,231
(grunting)

46
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,943
Hey, you want my keys?
Get them now, jerks.

47
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,612
(laughs) So long, jerks.

48
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,823
(laughing)

49
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,074
(mimics engine rumbling)

50
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,123
Running after the car, huh?
Let's see if you can follow this.

51
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,583
(screaming)

52
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,084
Oh, that's it.

53
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,753
(whistles)

54
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,214
HOMER: (humming)

55
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,592
-MAN: Where to, pal?
-HOMER: Moe's Tavern.

56
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,761
Good morning, everybody.

57
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,181
What's for breakfast, cutie?

58
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,475
Homie, it's 5 p.m. We're having dinner.

59
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:08,229
What? Wait a... That can't be right.

60
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:12,692
Wait. Was last night the night
we set the clocks ahead eight hours?

61
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,485
No. It was the night
You got loaded at Moe's

62
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,653
and the car had to be towed home.

63
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,072
If I was that drunk, I would remember it.

64
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,826
It's true. I couldn't even wake
you up for work this morning.

65
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,371
I had to tell Mr. Burns
you had violent diarrhea.

66
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:29,083
Oh, couldn't you come up
with a less embarrassing lie?

67
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,377
But you did have violent diarrhea.

68
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,465
Nobody open the hallway closet
until I say it's OK.

69
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,091
BOTH: (shuddering)

70
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,302
Do you remember how you got home
last night, Dad?

71
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,720
Of course.

72
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:45,183
It was, uh, some kind of a light rail.

73
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,310
There's no light rail in Springfield.

74
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,479
Oh, won't anyone pretend to believe me?

75
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,565
-I will, Dad.
-That's why you're my favorite.

76
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,905
All right, time for my favorite show.

77
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,241
<i>MAN (on TV) : MTC... Monkey Trauma Center</i>

78
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,784
<i>will not be seen tonight.</i>

79
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:03,785
Oh.

80
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,537
<i>MAN: ...so we may proudly</i>
<i>present this much cheaper show.</i>

81
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,208
<i>WOMAN (on TV) : Taxicab Conversations.</i>

82
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,294
Hey, I read about this show
in <i>Teen Modern Maturity.</i>

83
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:17,090
They film passengers with hidden cameras
and catch them at their most uninhibited.

84
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,633
That explains that.

85
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,802
(disco music playing over speakers)

86
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,513
(humming)

87
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,683
-(imitating disco beats)
-Looks like somebody got down tonight.

88
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,519
Disco Stu always gets down, baby.

89
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,021
Because when the beat is hot, the...

90
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,064
(sighs)

91
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,775
-Hey, can you keep a secret?
-What is it, hon?

92
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,568
I hate disco.

93
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:41,781
It's all I've talked about for so long,
people think I'm a one-note guy.

94
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,283
(sighs)

95
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,576
It's just getting harder, you know.

96
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,871
I had no idea Disco Stu was so complex.

97
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,542
-How you doing?
-Talky thing, ain't you?

98
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,169
Another proud moment for the Simpsons.

99
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,131
I don't remember anybody telling me
I was gonna be on TV.

100
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,549
(slurping)

101
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,050
So, what do you do for a living?

102
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,678
Oh, you know, I'm a guy at a place.

103
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:08,099
How'd you get such a crappy job?
You a convict or a junkie?

104
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,102
-Little of both. You got a family?
-Oh, yeah.

105
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,313
Wife and two or three kids.

106
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,356
Can't imagine my life without them.

107
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,442
Oh, you big fooler.

108
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,653
Pretending not to remember
so you could surprise us.

109
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,698
(chuckles) Yeah, I'm pretty great.

110
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,117
At the end of a hard day

111
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,122
there's no better feeling than coming home
to the people that you love.

112
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,876
-Oh, Homie.
-That is so sweet.

113
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,836
I had no idea, Dad.

114
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,672
I just assumed with all the
stranglings, you know...

115
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,675
That my family isn't the center
of my universe?

116
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,677
Are you nuts?

117
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,804
Then there's those other days

118
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:50,683
where you just wish you never got married
or had kids.

119
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,893
(groans)

120
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,395
One minute, you're a carefree teenager,

121
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,359
with dreams of being a rock
star, or a photographer for <i>Playboy...</i>

122
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:03,237
then, bam, some babe
gets her claws in you...

123
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,238
Huh?

124
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:09,160
...and, boom, you got a bunch
of kids that always needs love.

125
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,745
BOTH: (gasping)

126
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,831
So whammo, you get stuck
in some boring job

127
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:18,586
where they don't let you play guitar
or take pictures of naked women.

128
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:23,091
And all you can do is watch yourself
get bald and fat

129
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,885
and kiss your dreams goodbye.

130
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:29,514
(snoring)

131
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:33,476
Oh, I can't believe they took
<i>Monkey Trauma Center </i>off for this.

132
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,064
(snoring)

133
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,441
<i>Lousy family.</i>

134
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:45,279
So I'm just some babe
who sank her claws into you.

135
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,241
-A hot babe.
-Oh!

136
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,118
Have you always resented us, Dad?

137
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,037
Oh, I don't resent you, sweetheart.

138
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,666
What I was trying to say,
and maybe I didn't use the right words

139
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,837
was that marriage is like a coffin
and each kid is another nail.

140
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,756
-But as coffins go...
-Please don't say anymore.

141
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,134
Sorry we ruined your life, Homer.

142
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,762
Hmph!

143
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,433
Oh, what have I done?

144
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,767
(alarm whistles)

145
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,358
-Get in.
-What?

146
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,193
Get in.

147
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,362
Hey, what's this suitcase for?

148
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,614
-Are we going on a trip?
-You are.

149
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,617
(laughing)

150
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,910
(whimpers)

151
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,497
Where are you taking me?

152
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,084
A place where you'll never be
bothered by your family again.

153
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,336
(gasps)

154
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,255
Oh.

155
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,382
(whimpers)

156
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,592
(screams)

157
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,803
(tires screech)

158
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,263
Get out of the car, Homer.

159
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,182
You can't just leave me out here.

160
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,267
There's not another woman for miles.

161
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,811
Sorry, Dad.
Maybe now you'll appreciate us.

162
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,397
While you're spending the week at...

163
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,983
Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp.

164
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,527
HOMER: (gasps)

165
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,071
The Rolling Stones' Rock 'n'
Roll Fantasy Camp.

166
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,240
But I thought you guys were mad at me.

167
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,868
For once in my life, I'm confused.

168
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,621
We had a family meeting and decided

169
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:20,583
that even though what you said about us
was incredibly thoughtless,

170
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,835
and hurtful, you had a point.

171
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,838
-Damn straight.
-You work a job you don't like

172
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,049
so I'm able to be home with the kids.

173
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:32,136
And you take me places you hate
like museums, plays and the Olive Garden.

174
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,931
And even though you knew
I ratted you out to the IRS,

175
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,891
-you never busted me on it.
-You what?

176
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:40,520
So to say thank you
for all your sacrifices,

177
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:45,399
we spent our family vacation
fund on something that's just for you.

178
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,485
-Do you like it?
-You guys are the best.

179
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,737
I love you. I love you.
I love you... Ugh, oh.

180
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,365
I'm OK. I love you.
I love you. I love you.

182
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,541
Hey, what gives?
Where are all the rock stars?

183
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,876
I don't know,
but it's starting to get dark.

-To rock!

195
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,999

00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,517
Hey, Mick, you gonna teach us
your cocksure strut?

202
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,145
Not today, I've got a ton of paperwork
to catch up on.

203

Ah, tell me about it. At my

207
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,580
-Have you been awake all night?
-I am so excited, I couldn't fall asleep.

208
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,999
I even took some pills
I found on the floor and still nothing.

209
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,959
You took pills you found on the floor?

210
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,588
Uh-huh, now I'm afraid that if
I stop talking, I'll die. Isn't Mick cool?

211
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,758
I thought he'd be all like,
"I'm a rock star. Aren't I great?"

212
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,510
But he's just like you or me
or Jesus over there.

213
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,931
-Can I have a guitar?
-Can I have a guitar?

214
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,642
(whistles) People. People.

215
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,936
If everyone's gonna pick guitar,
I'm not gonna have enough to go around.

Oh, come on.

217
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,731
But there's lots
of other fun instruments...

218
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,982
like bass.

219
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,073
Come on, who'd like to be a bass player?

220
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,450
Out of my way, nerdlinger.

221

-My image.
-OTTO: Get me the Strat.

222
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,454
Hand me the Strat.

223
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,039
I'm telling Mr. Jagger.

224
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,416
Ooh, "I'm telling Mr. Jagger."

Gonna Go My Way?" playing)

be a defiant statement of individuality.

God, no.

229
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:23,849
May we talk about, uh, accentuating
the masculine area?

230
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,894
Did you hear that, people? Apu asked
about crotch stuffing.

231
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,980
Now, I don't do it. Kenny Loggins does.

Now, a guitar has many, many nicknames.

An ax, a gitbox...
Well, I guess that's it.

236
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,330
Anyway, we're gonna start
with the fundamentals.
