1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,043
(theme music playing)

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,464
CHORUS: <i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

3
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:11,136
(bell rings)

4
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,222
(whistle blows)

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,311
(beeps)

6
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,776
(playing the blues)

7
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,491
(tires screeching)

8
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,412
D'oh! (screams)

9
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,414
(tires screeching)

10
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:59,309
Hello, I'm Kent Brockman,
and this is <i>Eye on Springfield.</i>

11
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,145
(flashy pop music playing)

12
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,054
I'm here with actor Rainier Wolfcastle,

13
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,807
who, surprisingly,
has filed for bankruptcy.

14
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,391
Rainier, what went wrong?

15
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,560
Three divorces in three months.

16
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,728
What can I say, Kent?

17
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,063
I'm a romantic.

18
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,565
But this personal tragedy translates

19
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,235
into a good, old-fashioned
bankruptcy sale.

20
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,737
Yeah, everything must go.

21
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,073
Even the painting of my Nana.

22
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,784
This was done on her wedding day,

23
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,745
or should I say... deading day?

24
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,123
How the mighty have fallen...

25
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,624
into my price range!

26
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,834
I wanna go there.

27
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,293
Dad, we are there.

28
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,628
Whoo-hoo!

29
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,841
Now, Rainier, I really
don't think it's right

30
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,051
to sell these <i>Playdude </i>centerfolds.

31
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,845
(girls chuckling)

32
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,972
Zip it, Holy Joe.

33
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,267
Are you taking us to another mansion?

34
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,643
Uh... yeah.

35
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,145
Uh, Miss September, I think

36
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,938
-you're gonna have to get in the trunk.
-Oh.

37
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,733
Whoa, a sword cane.

38
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,861
Everything here is sword.

39
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,445
Sword baseball bat.

40
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,697
Sword rifle.

41
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,865
Sword pineapple.

42
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,783
Sword sword sharpener.

43
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,869
Sword pie. It's...

44
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,954
Hey, what happened to the sword pie?

45
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,540
What do I do now?

46
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,750
Hey, look, a cyborg hand.

47
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,544
This could really come in useful.

48
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,548
Well, well, look who's gone Hollywood.

49
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,384
Whoo... um... eh...

50
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,969
Do you need some assistance

51
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,471
picking over the tattered
remains of my life?

52
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,182
No, I'm good.

53
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,267
Hey, your early porno movies.

54
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,477
Holy... Are any of these hetero?

55
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,979
What's there is there.

56
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,274
You got any junk that'll go up
in value after you die?

57
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,984
Right this way.

58
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,446
My first weight set.

59
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,530
(gasps)

60
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,948
The weights that changed you

61
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,827
from a Bavarian cream puff
to a mass of twitchy muscles?

62
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:23,995
(chuckling)

63
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,122
They know you are talking about them.

64
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,874
I'll take it.

65
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,376
Who's up for coconut oil?

66
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,175
There's no way all this junk
is going to fit in that car.

67
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,676
Now, don't worry.

68
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,639
This is what all those hours
of playing Tetris were for.

69
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,850
(Tetris 8-bit music plays)

70
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,231
No!

71
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,533
Perfect.

72
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,868
But there's no room for you.

73
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:04,953
D'oh!

74
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,079
(game-over tones)

75
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,914
Do you think you could
give me a lift home?

76
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,875
Sure, I'll carry you
in this giant Snuggli.

77
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,044
I used it to carry Rob Schneider

78
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,672
in the movie <i>My Baby is an Ugly Man.</i>

79
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,048
Mm? Ooh.

80
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,216
(grunts)

81
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,676
(yawns)

82
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,887
Your heartbeat is so soothing.

83
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:23,972
Shh.

84
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,224
Time for sleep, little fatso.

85
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,396
Aw!

86
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,855
Ew! Mom!

87
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,774
I think Maggie fudged her Huggies.

88
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,401
Bart, don't say it like that.

89
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,610
You'll hurt her feelings.

90
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,611
(sniffing)

91
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,656
(gagging) Geez Louise!

92
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,659
How did you turn
cinnamon applesauce into that?

93
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,163
Don't try to pin this on me, sister.

94
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,583
MARGE: Sorry. Emergency.

95
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,752
(grunting)

96
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:55,878
Hello, Mrs. Homer.

97
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,714
Apu, where is your bathroom?

98
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,048
The bathroom is not for customers.

99
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,134
Please use the crackhouse
across the street.

100
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,974
Oh! That is the most pungent thing

101
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,892
I have ever smelled, and I am from India.

102
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,520
All right, all right,
but speak of this to no one.

103
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,985
Don't worry, that sign is just a ruse--

104
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,903
like all "high voltage" signs.

105
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,363
Hmm...

106
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,953
There's a happy baby, aren't you?

107
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,372
(laughing happily)

108
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,874
Gimme your purse.

109
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,418
Oh, God. Oh, God, oh, God.

110
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,211
-Shut up.
-(both gasp)

111
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,590
-That's not a purse. It's a diaper bag.
-What?

112
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,883
It looks like a purse.

113
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,885
-That's why I bought it but it's really--
-Shut up!

114
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,261
(whimpers)

115
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,555
Fine. I'll just take this!

116
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,474
(gasps)

117
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,944
Come on, Mom. Let's go.

118
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,154
Mom?

119
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,865
-Are you OK?
-(Marge crying)

120
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,745
It's all my fault my wife got mugged.

121
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,955
There you have it, boys. Case closed.

122
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,583
Look, this really made me feel vulnerable.

123
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,169
I want to know how soon you think
you'll catch this guy.

124
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,379
Don't worry, Marge.

125
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,923
I swear to you I'll put my best man on it.

126
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,299
BOTH: Mm?

127
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,842
Oh, boy, is this awkward.

128
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,762
Wait, Marge.

129
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,264
I don't want you to leave
the house without this.

130
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,934
Emergency whistle,
pepper spray, and this map

131
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,311
of the most vulnerable parts
of a man's body.

132
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,105
Why is it Ned Flanders?

133
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,733
Oh, like I'm going to kick
Chief Wiggum in the groin.

134
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,029
OK, Marge, you can do this.

135
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,657
You've done it a thousand times before.

136
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,534
-Hi, Mrs. Simpson.
-Aah!

137
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,743
(coughs)

138
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,079
Oh, no! I pepper sprayed Ralph.

139
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,958
(coughs): Even my boogers are spicy.

140
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,835
Sorry!

141
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,170
Let's go home.

142
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,672
There's nothing dangerous there

143
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,382
except for the electrical wiring.

144
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,802
(breathing heavily)

145
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,429
Mom, you didn't get the milk.

146
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,931
And you parked on top of the mailman.

147
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,933
It's OK. All part of the job.

148
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,853
Can you believe I get paid
to wear short pants?

149
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,020
Oh, I'm sorry.

150
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,064
I'll come right out and help you.

151
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,109
(grunts)

152
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,907
I gave your necklace
to my cheap girlfriend.

153
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,785
I just throw it in a drawer at night.

154
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,580
(cackles)

155
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,957
No! It'll tangle!

156
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,714
Sorry, I can't go outside.

157
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,840
I'll call for help.

158
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,259
No hurry, I got plenty to read.

159
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,845
Whoo, <i>Twilight Zone </i>magazine.

160
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:54,056
Oh, no, my glasses are broken.

161
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,143
(Twilight Zone theme plays)

162
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,355
Marge, I'm afraid
you've developed agoraphobia--

163
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,399
A fear of leaving the home.

164
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,860
I recommend watching this
Lifetime Channel movie.

165
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,238
It's called, <i>The Woman</i>
<i>Who Died In Her Home.</i>

166
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,157
(chuckles)

167
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,783
Oh, my God.

168
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,368
Isn't there anything I can do?

169
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,121
Marge, I suggest
you slowly desensitize yourself

170
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,664
to the fear of going outside.

171
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,208
Create controlled situations

172
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,751
where you can leave the house

173
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,919
without pain or panic.

174
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,172
What if I can't feel
comfortable outside again?

175
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,216
Then I hope you like
throwing dinner parties.

176
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,300
I do.

177
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,135
No one wants to eat dinner
at a crazy lady's house.

178
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,428
Get real.

179
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,721
LISA: Don't worry, Mom.

180
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:37,141
This first time, we'll only take
a few steps outside.

181
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,604
All right, just to the mailbox and back.

182
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,359
Now, Dr. Hibbert said

183
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,361
to use a number from one to ten

184
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,947
to describe how anxious you are.

185
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,200
Two... three... two.

186
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,494
Don't worry, everything is fine.

187
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,995
-What the hell is that?
-Eight.

188
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,790
-Dad, it's just a bug.
-Two.

189
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,125
It's not just a bug,
it's the queen of something!

190
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,795
Ten, ten, ten, ten.

191
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,588
Don't worry, I'll set fire to the hive.

192
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,676
Twelve. Fifteen!

193
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,344
-(bees buzzing)
-703!

194
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,637
Run!

195
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,184
Oh, my goodness.

196
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,978
It looks just like the Kwik-E-Mart.

197
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,522
Yep, but you're still safe at home.

198
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,148
After a few practice trips here,

199
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,776
the real Kwik-E-Mart
will be a piece of cake.

200
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,112
-Now, Bart will play Apu.
-Mm-hmm.

201
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,863
I'm a magazine rack.

202
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,615
Look, I'm the first to admit it.

203
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,701
I don't write good parts for women.

204
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,119
I'm a robber!

205
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,370
(grunts)

206
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,205
(screams) Help!

207
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,791
All this does is shoot bubbles.

208
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:44,875
(yells)

209
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,669
Silly String!

210
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,337
Kids, I'll go find your mother.

211
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,172
Dad, we're canceling the rest of the play.

212
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,465
What play?

213
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,509
What the hell's he talking about?

214
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,889
-Marge?
-I'm going to sleep down here tonight.

215
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,644
Listen, kids.

216
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,813
Your mom is going to be living
in the basement,

217
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,524
but with our love, she'll get better soon.

218
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,567
What if she doesn't?

219
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,277
Then we'll have to smoke her out.

220
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:17,658
And may the peace of God
be with you. Amen.

221
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,077
-MARGE: <i>Amen. Over.</i>
-(static)

222
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,121
Breaker, breaker, Bartman to shut-in.

223
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,956
The big guy's asleep. Please advise. Over.

224
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,042
Whack him with the hymnal. Over.

225
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,960
-I'll roger that big time.
-D'oh!

226
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,503
HOMER: <i>Why, you little...</i>

227
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,089
(chuckles) <i>Oh, hi, Jesus.</i>

228
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,382
<i>I was just...</i>

229
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,092
(Homer munching)

230
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,096
Wow, honey, eating dinner
downstairs is great.

231
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,222
Isn't it, kids?

232
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,432
The air hockey table

233
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,934
makes passing the carrots a breeze.

234
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,397
Bart, eat your spinach.

235
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,607
No way.

236
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,941
Yes way.

237
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,694
(both grunting)

238
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,945
Stop it, please.

239
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,489
I'm trying to eat.

240
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,366
And all those feet going by the window

241
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,909
are really creeping me out.

242
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,786
It's like we're at <i>Cheers.</i>

243
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,120
I loved that show

244
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,623
because you always knew it
was only a half hour till <i>Wings.</i>

245
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,792
Then you could just sleep till Monday.

246
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,127
BOTH: Bye, Mom.

247
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,963
MARGE: I'm sending the cat up
with your lunches.

248
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,341
(grunted meows)

249
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,389
(meowing)

250
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,184
Good-bye, kids.

251
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,520
(sighs) What to do now?

252
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,563
Too crazy to go outside,

253
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,566
not crazy enough
to have imaginary friends.

254
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,360
Why did Homer buy those?

255
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,112
No one's ever going to use them.

256
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,156
Hmm.

257
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,992
-(grunts) MAN ON TV: <i>And three...</i>

258
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,994
<i>and four...</i>

259
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,996
<i>and five eggs.</i>

260
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,416
<i>Ladies, feel that burn.</i>

261
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,668
<i>If you don't, the oven's not on.</i>

262
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,002
MARGE: Ten...

263
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,964
Eleven...

264
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,466
Twelve...!

265
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,888
I can bench twice as
much as when I started.

266
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,724
And look at my abs.

267
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,143
BOTH: Mom!

268
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,978
Ooh-woo-woo-woo!

269
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,646
I'm married to Joey Heatherton.

270
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,401
Ooh, you know what would
zest up this Hollandaise?

271
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,652
A lemon.

272
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,863
Dad, do you plan to get in shape?

273
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,031
No, actually, I'm going
to eat twice as much.

274
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,199
Excellent.

275
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,451
Uh, guys?

276
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,036
Mom just left the basement.

277
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,413
(all gasp)

278
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,958
(gasps) She's in the backyard.

279
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,253
I got all the way out to the tree

280
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,672
before I realized I'd left the house.

281
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,758
(grunts)

282
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,303
(gasps) I'm stronger than I've ever been.

283
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,597
I don't have to go back inside.

284
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,849
I'm not afraid.

285
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,142
-All right, Mom!
-Yay, Mom!

286
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,310
Whoo-hoo!

287
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,021
I'm not afraid!

288
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,398
Ned! I'm not afraid!

289
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,067
Well, aren't you a super-duper recouper.

290
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,402
Grampa!

291
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,488
I'm not afraid!

292
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,990
Then you're not paying
close enough attention.

293
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,951
(gasps) You!

294
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,412
What you been up to? Living in fear?

295
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,914
Not anymore.

296
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,457
(grunting)

297
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,542
Ow-ow-ow!

298
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,464
(glass shatters)

299
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,174
(grunts)

300
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,807
You've just been Marge-inalized.

301
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,811
(cheering)

302
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,771
Marge, that was amazing.

303
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,898
It's like I'm married to Shaft.

304
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,484
Hey, Chief, I think
that's the guy who mugged her.

305
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,945
Yep, looks like
she caught her own criminal...

306
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,823
Unlike the rest of you lazybones.

307
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,449
You're not going to find those criminals

308
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,243
looking at your feet, people.

309
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,499
(theme from <i>Rocky </i>plays)

310
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,802
(metal clinking)

311
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,265
WOMAN: Marge Simpson?

312
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,599
It's Ruth.

313
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,017
Ruth Powers.

314
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,812
Ruth Powers? My old neighbor?

315
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,856
Oh, my goodness, look at you!

316
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,524
I got this body in prison.

317
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,943
I was Miss Mexican Mafia
three years in a row.

318
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,152
Wow!

319
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,363
(seagulls crying)

320
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,574
You know, another four inches
on your neck,

321
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,908
and you'd look pretty hot.

322
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,660
Ever thought of competing?

323
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,704
I don't have those kind of muscles.

324
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,747
Well, you could, if you use these.

325
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,291
Steroids?

326
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,792
I can't take drugs.

327
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,919
I have so many anti-drug bumper stickers,

328
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,297
I'd be making a liar out of my tailgate.

329
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,592
Steroids aren't drugs.

330
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,135
They occur naturally in the body,

331
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,846
like sweat, or tumors.

332
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,472
But aren't there side effects?

333
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,517
Yes, their main side effect is greatness.

334
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,896
But if you'd rather be weak
and helpless...

335
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,898
No, no.

336
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,526
(Popeye the Sailor Man theme plays)

337
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,738
I feel good, with no repercussions.

338
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,615
(humming)

339
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,949
A little of this, a little of that.

340
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,369
Bulkenoids for my lats,

341
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,580
mesomax for my delts,

342
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:18,042
and estrogen blockers
for that minty taste.

343
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:21,837
(gulping)

344
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,838
Whoa!

345
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,923
(horn beeps)

346
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,591
Hurry up, kids. You'll miss the bus.

347
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,929
(hollering)

348
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,806
(grunts)

349
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,934
Not so fast, busboy.

350
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,102
Man! What am I smoking?

351
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,313
Oh, yeah. Pot.

352
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,690
BART AND LISA: Thanks, mom.

353
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,861
Bye, kids.

354
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,404
Bye-bye.

355
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,368
Haw-haw! Your mom changed!

356
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,040
Hey, hot stuff, I've got
a competition tomorrow.

357
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,542
I could use a good-luck snuggle.

358
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,252
I'd rather talk about our feelings.

359
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,047
I feel that illegal
performance-enhancing drugs

360
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,131
are too common these days.

361
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,175
-Rebuttal?
-(grunts)

362
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,843
Let's do it.

363
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,305
Oh, uh... Uh, listen, my bulky flower,

364
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,807
I-I have an early day...

365
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,225
I wasn't asking.

366
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,519
(whimpering)

367
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,940
Morning, kids. I made your lunches.

368
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,024
They're on the table.

369
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,777
Huh?

370
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,487
Why didn't Mom make our lunch?

371
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,198
Your mom has a lot of stuff to shave.

372
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,950
Ow. Ow.

373
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,910
Ow. Ow.

374
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,873
ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):
<i>Now, let's meet the ladies</i>

375
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,875
<i>who our doctors assure us are women...</i>

376
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,713
<i>the Iron Maidens.</i>

377
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,298
<i>Ay caramba!</i>

378
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,758
I'm off women forever.

379
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,889
(grunts)

380
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,891
(gruff voice) Support the arts!

381
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,894
(all cheering)

382
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,732
This is the cheapest vacation
you've ever taken me on.

383
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,735
<i>♪ The man who shot Liberty Valance ♪</i>

384
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,529
<i>♪ He shot Liberty Valance ♪</i>

385
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:14,033
<i>♪ He was the bravest of them all ♪</i>

386
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,367
Nice lady.

387
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,119
In second place...

388
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,997
Marge Simpson.

389
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,710
Second place?

390
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,962
Oh, man, this'll just encourage her.

391
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,923
I'm tired of her
criticizing my saggy glutes.

392
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,135
Quiet. Her muscular ears can hear us.

393
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,848
(grunts)

394
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,935
So then, I pop my delts, clench and bam!

395
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,729
Not a dry eye in the house.

396
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,355
Oh, I'm so proud of you, honey.

397
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,941
You bulked up, but managed
to keep your femininity.

398
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,194
And that's why I didn't win.

399
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,612
Sorry, sir, sorry.

400
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,490
Starting tomorrow,
I'm going to up my glyco-load,

401
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,241
use a denser ripping gel...

402
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,326
Denser?

403
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,535
Damn straight!

404
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,622
I didn't sacrifice
my period for second place.

405
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,457
(chuckles)

406
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,125
I hear that!

407
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,377
Uh, listen, Marge.

408
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,339
Um... how can I put this delicately?

409
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,884
I don't got enough booze in this place
to make you look good.

410
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,095
(grunts) Ya!

411
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,889
Maybe death will stop your yammering, huh?

412
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,057
Marge, easy...

413
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,058
Ya! (yells)

414
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,559
(all gasp)

415
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,978
Everyone, pile on Homer's wife.

416
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,271
(grunting)

417
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,610
(song on radio)
<i>♪ Love is a battlefield... ♪</i>

418
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,403
(grunting)

419
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,282
<i>♪ At last... ♪</i>

420
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,618
<i>♪ Relax, don't do it ♪</i>

421
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,746
MAN: Disco Stu should have Disco Ducked.

422
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,083
(Homer whistling)

423
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,546
(classical music playing)

424
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,090
(all grunt)

425
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,262
(whimpering and crying)

426
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,649
(siren blaring)

427
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,693
Marge?

428
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,533
Somewhere in that sea of bull hormones

429
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,869
is the sweet, wonderful girl I married.

430
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,288
The woman who instead of swatting a fly

431
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,748
would give it a bath
and sent it on its way.

432
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,502
I'd sure like to go home
and have Jiffy Pop with her.

433
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,298
Oh, my gosh!

434
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,632
You're right.

435
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,262
Steroids have turned me
into everything I hate.

436
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,264
Let's go home, sweetie.

437
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,266
Club soda will get that blood out.

438
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,392
(groans)

439
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,189
Well, there's only one way
to recoup my losses.

440
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,404
Whoa, Moe, wait a minute.

441
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,198
Don't you have to buy insurance first?

442
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,365
Oh, crap.

443
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,121
(gasps)

444
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,207
(grunts)

445
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,794
You know, I really do miss being a lady.

446
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,131
And I miss being
your knight in flabby armor.

447
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,508
Oh, Homie.

448
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,805
(giggling)

449
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,103
HOMER: Ready for a <i>real </i>workout, Marge?

450
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,396
MARGE: Mm-hmm.

451
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,773
Good! Can you wax the car?

452
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,899
HOMER: Ow! Ow! Ow!

453
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,275
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!

454
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,612
(theme from <i>Rocky </i>playing)

455
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,493
(theme song playing)

456
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,781
Shh!
