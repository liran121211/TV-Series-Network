00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,340
(murmuring)

184
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,966
I was going to tell you this privately,

185
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,678
but because of your incredibly
low test score,

186
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,473
we're sending you <i>back </i>to third grade.

187
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,934
(laughing)

188
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,977
The... wh... eh... Huh?

189
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,688
What? I've got to be
in the same class as her?

190
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,566
What? I've got to be
in the same class as him?

191
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,485
Hmm?

192
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,904
They're going to be in
the same class as each other?

193
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,113
(changes channel)

194
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,700
(gasps) An old army buddy
is visiting Mannix?

195
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,248
Class, meet our newest third graders--

196
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,124
Lisa and Bart Simpson.

197
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,585
Lisa comes to us from Miss Hoover...

198
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,628
(gulping)

199
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,589
...while Bart was taught
by Mrs. Krabappel.

200
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,674
(coughing) Slut!

201
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,926
ALL: Hi, Bart and Lisa.

202
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,596
A rooster sits on a roof, facing north.

203
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,889
It lays an egg.

204
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,140
Which way does it roll?

205
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,560
OK, the sun rises in the east

206
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,478
so the rooster
would probably want to lay it

207
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,021
on the cool side...

208
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,773
Roosters don't lay eggs.

209
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:26,732
They're boys.

210
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,984
Very good, Bart.

211
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:28,985
Mm-hmm.

212
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,529
Lisa, I want you to stick close
to your big brother

213
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,738
until you catch up.

214
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,657
(scraping)

215
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,244
-(loud clang)
-(appalled gasp)

216
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,704
Ha-ha.

217
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,416
Young man, you're not in this class.

218
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,584
What are you doing here?

219
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,002
Laughing at jerks.

220
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,218
"Quiet nerds burp only near school."

221
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,470
Bart, I'm doing my geography homework.

222
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,306
I know. That's how you remember

223
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,890
the four original provinces of Canada.

224
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,977
"Quebec, New Brunswick,
Ontario, Nova Scotia--

225
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,354
Quiet nerds burp only near school."

226
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,314
And here's how you remember

227
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,565
the principal exports:

228
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,817
"Dogs eat barf solely
on Wednesday, Mabel."

229
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,320
Stop. I want to learn on my own!

230
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,240
Canada's Governors General,

231
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,700
"Clowns love haircuts,

232
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,410
so should Lee Marvin's valet."

233
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,578
Get out!

234
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,746
(creaking)

235
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,206
McCONNELL: Here are your math tests.

236
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,043
Morgan, Dakota, Ashley,

237
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:31,130
Dakota, Tyler, Tyler, Lisa...

238
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,799
What's this weird mark next to my "A"?

239
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,301
That's an A-minus.

240
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,136
M-Minus?

241
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,596
Nice work, Bart.

242
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,930
An "A"?

243
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,223
Copacetic.

244
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,850
You did better than me?

245
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,685
Ah, I took this test last year.

246
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,936
The answer key never changes.

247
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,898
"B-C-B-C-A-A-B-B-C-C-D- False-False-True

248
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,107
William Jennings Bryan."

249
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,567
That's cheating!

250
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,860
Bart cheated!

251
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,112
Young lady, in the third grade,

252
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,864
we don't care for tattletales.

253
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:57,990
Oh...

254
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,368
And we don't care for moaners, either.

255
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,370
(crying)

256
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,997
Sobbing only pushes Bart's grade higher.

257
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,540
(pen squeaking)

258
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,417
(sobbing)

259
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,211
Pukers in back.

260
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,421
Kids, look what I got you

261
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,382
for your third-grade field trip,

262
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,801
matching fanny packs!

263
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,678
Now your fannies match.

264
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,096
(both groan)

265
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,681
(both grunting)

266
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,183
-Hey, get away from me. Get...!
-Out... ow, oh!

267
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,310
-Quit it!
-Ow, let go!

268
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,228
-Ow!
-Stop!

269
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,605
You'll crush your juice boxes!

270
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,981
(both moan)

271
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,653
(both groaning angrily)

272
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,115
All right, everybody choose
a buddy for the field trip.

273
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,199
I'll take Kyle!

274
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,409
I'll take Ashley!

275
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:45,079
Saying your buddy's name
out loud is a security risk.

276
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,747
I'll just put you two together.

277
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,417
(both moaning)

278
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,629
(song playing) <i>♪ There's a swingin' town</i>
<i>I know called... ♪</i>

279
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,132
<i>♪ Capital City... ♪</i>

280
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,802
Punch buggy red! (grunts)

281
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,929
Ow! You are such an immature...

282
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,389
Punch buggy white!

283
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,473
Ow!

284
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,391
Stop fighting.

285
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,475
He started it.

286
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,018
He did Punch Buggy first.

287
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,437
What's "Punch Buggy"?

288
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,688
When you see a Volkswagen Bug

289
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,356
you punch somebody and yell the color.

290
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,983
(murmuring)

291
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,359
(all gasping)

292
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,653
-BOY: Punch Buggy blue!
-(thud) Ow!

293
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,864
-GIRL: Punch Buggy green!
-(thud) Ow!

294
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,449
-BOY: Punch Buggy taupe!
-(thud) Ow!

295
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,492
-(blows landing, crying)
-GIRL: That really hurt!

296
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,578
OTTO: <i>Two for flinching!</i>

297
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,787
(two blows land)

298
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,789
(children moaning)

299
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,877
Now, as we cross the street,

300
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,087
I want you to hold hands with your buddy.

301
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,839
(both moan)

302
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,258
(vehicle approaching)

303
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,593
(tires screech)

304
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,220
Hey, dude, who's your girlfriend?

305
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,139
(laughter)

306
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,432
Did you see his face?

307
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,185
(tires screech)

308
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,352
What happened, dude?

309
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,937
Did your girlfriend dump you?

310
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,272
(laughter)

311
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,483
(goofy honk)

312
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,526
(both moan)

313
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,571
Now children, if you look up
at the capitol dome,

314
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,990
you'll see a mural of our state bird,

315
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,492
the Pot-bellied Sparrow

316
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,952
eating our state pasta, bow-tie.

317
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,120
(children exclaiming)

318
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,414
Order, order, order.

319
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,084
The chair recognizes
the esteemed representative

320
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,377
from Capital City...

321
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,172
BART: The Capital City Goofball?

322
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,173
That's right.

323
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,009
To win, he spent $80 million
from his own pocket.

324
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:26,096
Mr. Speaker, the time has come
to redesign our state flag.

325
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,349
This confederate symbol
is an embarrassment.

326
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,851
Particularly as we are a northern state.

327
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,686
(crowd murmuring)

328
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,523
This lively debate has given me an idea.

329
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,317
Tonight, each buddy team
is going to design

330
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,902
a new state flag.

331
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,821
Homework on a field trip?

332
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,239
What have <i>you </i>been huffing?

333
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,160
Well, Bart's being his usual jerky self

334
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,413
but, Mom, I'm really excited
about this new flag design.

335
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,124
Oh, and the hotel gives you
a free USA Today

336
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,417
outside your room.

337
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,710
No, I'm sure it's free.

338
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,879
OK, I won't touch it.

339
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,548
Well, make sure you don't.

340
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:04,093
And try not to let your brother
get under your skin, honey.

341
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,011
Believe me, he doesn't.

342
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,013
His act is getting old fast.

343
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,932
He think he's really cool...

344
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,600
but frankly, the other kids

345
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,228
are starting to wake up
and smell the cooties.

346
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,691
One last sunbeam... and we're done.

347
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,776
"To Fraternal Love."

348
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,403
When I get through with that flag,

349
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,613
it's gonna be a Bart Mangled Banner.

350
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,323
("Pomp and Circumstance" playing)

351
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:31,120
So, I understand you children
have some state flags for me.

352
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,413
Who would like to go first?

353
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,747
We would, Governor Bailey!

354
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,915
Team Simpson!

355
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,959
I spearheaded this one.

356
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,879
I'll just unfurl this...

357
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,589
(horrified scream)

358
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,427
(all gasp)

359
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,471
That was my worst unfurling ever!

360
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,890
Lisa, how could you?

361
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,600
The governor is crying.

362
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,560
(sobbing)

363
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,061
(moans)

364
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,272
Ha-ha!

365
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,025
You weren't on this field trip.

366
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,359
How did you get here?

367
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,569
Biked.

368
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,492
Bart, I am <i>so </i>mad at you!

369
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,037
(laughs) You should have seen
the look on your face.

370
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,455
It was something like this.

371
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,456
(laughing)

372
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,333
(growls)

373
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,753
(both grunting)

374
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,090
(bubbling)

375
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,926
(groaning)

376
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,096
(horn honking)

377
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,765
-Huh?
-(gasps) The bus!

378
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,311
OK, children, before we leave

379
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,854
is anyone missing their buddy?

380
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,105
ALL: No.

381
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,108
Ah, the buddy system. Foolproof.

382
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,860
Floor it, Otto.

383
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,528
(gears grind)

384
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,075
LISA: Wait, wait!

385
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,409
(both panting)

386
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,535
Ha, ha.

387
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,162
(sing-song voice) They left without you

388
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,373
They left without you, too, you idiot.

389
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,499
Well, if I'm such an idiot,

390
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,668
how come I'm the smartest kid
in the third grade?

391
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,212
Because you've already done it once.

392
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,214
You've lost me.

393
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,049
Oh, forget it.

394
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,843
Hey, how do we get back?

395
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,303
No problem. We'll just circle around

396
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,930
like those kids
in <i>The Blair Witch Project.</i>

397
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,187
(panting) I must be getting close.
I recognize that girl!

398
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,318
Oh, Bart, I think we're lost.

399
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,820
I used to be lost...

400
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,863
until a friend turned me on to a book,

401
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,949
a book that changed my life.

402
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,243
It's called Lisa is Stupid.

403
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,452
You die now!

404
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,663
(gagging) Whoa!

405
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,665
Hey!

406
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,874
(laughing)

407
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,252
(teacher sobbing)

408
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,795
They're gone.

409
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,338
I don't know what happened.

410
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,549
If the buddy system can fail,

411
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,426
I don't know what to believe in.

412
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,011
There, there, Audrey.

413
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,262
It's happened to all of us.

414
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,473
Willie, we have two more
names for the wall.

415
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,058
(lone bugle plays mournfully)

416
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,143
(sniffling)

417
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:03,230
Ach! Why is it always the kids
with the long names?

418
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,649
(chugging)

419
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,114
(doorbell rings)

420
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,074
Hello, Principal Skinner.

421
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,076
A parent who waives
her right to sue says "What?"

422
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,286
What?

423
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,663
-Got it.
-Hey, you can't fool us.

424
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,707
We're from the "Learn to Fart" state.

425
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,750
(exhales)

426
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,835
Bart and Lisa are lost in Capital City

427
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,503
and presumed crying.

428
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,504
(gasps)

429
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,298
My poor babies!

430
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,841
I'm so sorry.

431
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,052
Lisa's a very special little girl,

432
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,721
and we'll spare no expense in finding her.

433
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,930
Well, what about Bart?

434
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,015
We're looking.

435
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,309
But in the meantime
the class clown pro-tem

436
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,310
will take his place.

437
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,270
Cowabunga!

438
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,856
(wind blowing)

439
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,858
(animal noises)

440
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,485
(Lisa shivering)

441
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,820
-You cold?
-What do you care?

442
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,113
(unzipping)

443
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,491
-Here.
-Thanks.

444
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,533
Where'd you get...

445
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,035
Oh.

446
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,995
Bart, you're my big brother.

447
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,955
You should act like it more often.

448
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,749
You know, protect me

449
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,334
from the bad things in the world.

450
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,088
Well, as far as nerdy little sisters go,

451
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,255
you're the coolest.

452
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,340
Thanks, Bart.

453
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,425
And I'm sorry I sabotaged your flag.

454
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,886
I'm sorry I got us lost out here.

455
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,096
Oh, and I'm sorry

456
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,473
I sawed the heads off
your Malibu Stacey dolls.

457
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,390
OK, you go.

458
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,184
I don't think I've done anything else.

459
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,268
OK, I'll go again.

460
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,938
Remember when your bike
was mangled by "gypsies"?

461
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,022
Yes...

462
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,482
(chuckles) Yeah, funny story,

463
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,317
One day, I was really bored

464
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,153
and Dad had left his steamroller idling
in the driveway...

465
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,823
This is where the kids were last seen.

466
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,740
(gasps)

467
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,660
The plastic casing from the tip
of Bart's shoelace!

468
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,663
A mother knows.

469
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,832
Well, he's not going
to get very far without that.

470
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,876
Bart, is that you?

471
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,461
MAN: No.

472
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,174
(rifles cocking)

473
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,760
-(both gasp)
-Say your prayers!

474
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,012
Oh, Lord, please strike
these mountain folk dead.

475
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,055
Bart!

476
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,515
Listen, we're really sorry.

477
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,808
We got lost on a field trip

478
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,101
from Springfield Elementary.

479
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,395
(sputters) Lost on a field trip?

480
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,105
Heck, why didn't you say so?

481
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,691
That's how Grandpappy wound up
in these parts.

482
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:15,404
They was taking us to Capital City to
see The Nutcracker.

483
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,240
And I wandered away from the group...

484
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,702
I married a bear
and I started up a family.

485
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,704
I told you, I ain't a bear.

486
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,165
(laughs) Rar, rar, rar.

487
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,084
No one understands you, She-Bear!

488
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,294
(laughs)

489
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,089
(car rattling)

490
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,966
Thanks for driving us back to town.

491
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,843
No problem. We were going there anyway

492
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,720
to pick up the new <i>Spy </i>magazine.

493
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,138
I'm sorry.

494
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,556
They don't publish that anymore.

495
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:46,393
The world I grewed up in is gone.

496
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,188
(kissing)

497
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,607
Oh, my special little guys!

498
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,984
You're OK! You're OK!

499
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,235
(kissing)

500
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,530
And, Maggie, you no longer have
to live with the burden

501
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,574
of replacing Bart and Lisa.

502
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,996
Well, if this episode
has taught us anything,

503
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,457
it's that nothing works better
than the status quo.

504
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,375
Bart, you're promoted
back to the fourth grade.

505
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,543
Yay!

506
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,378
And Lisa, you have a choice--

507
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,756
you may continue to be
challenged in third grade

508
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,216
or return to second grade

509
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,218
and be merely a big fish in a small pond.

510
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,677
Big fish! Big fish!

511
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,304
ALL: Aw...

512
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,973
The status quo.

513
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,808
The status quo?

514
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,602
<i>Ay carumba!</i>

515
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,270
That's just sad.

516
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,571
(closing theme music)

517
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,569
Shh!
