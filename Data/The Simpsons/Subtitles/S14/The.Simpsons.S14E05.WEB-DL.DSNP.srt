1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:03,044
(theme music playing)

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,839
CHORUS: <i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,052
(bell ringing)

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:11,970
(tires screech)

5
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,724
D'oh! (screams)

6
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:21,938
(squeaks)

7
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,202
(whistles)

8
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,620
(yells)

9
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,415
(whistling and groaning)

10
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:46,212
Oh, this doesn't look good, sir.
This man could sue us.

11
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,257
Yes. If he's smart,
he'll hold out for millions.

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,218
Whoo-hoo! I got skybox tickets.

13
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,638
And with only 20% loss
of my brain function.

14
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,808
Life is... (slurring)

15
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,817
Can't beat a skybox. All the excitement...

16
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:12,363
of being in the sky with the security
of being in a box.

17
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:16,284
Oh, this is gonna be the coolest
basketball game ever.

18
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,661
Actually, it says here
we're gonna see hockey.

19
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,829
(in unison) No!

20
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,957
(people screaming)

21
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,130
-Would you care for some cologne?
-You have anything...

22
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,800
-with ground-up whale in it?
-But of course.

23
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,678
Hey, don't we regular fans get anything?

24
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,388
(both grunt)

25
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,557
Hey, do we tip these guys, or what?

26
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,730
Wow, it's so fancy.

27
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,191
It's like Moby's house on <i>Cribs.</i>

28
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,526
Paint your portrait, sir?

29
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,402
Can you paint me knocking out
Larry Holmes?

30
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,862
Certainly.

31
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,575
Don't hit my face.

32
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,662
-OK, where do you want it?
-I don't know. Work the stomach.

33
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,374
Mm. That takes me back.

34
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:11,339
Check out those non-skybox
losers watching hockey without sushi.

35
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,216
If you can call that hockey.

36
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,219
Hey, Homer's looking down his nose at us.

37
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,764
Let's take Mr. Figgy Pudding down a peg.

38
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,600
Otto, what are you waiting for?
Get your ass on my neck.

39
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,018
(Otto grunts)

40
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,397
I'm getting close. I smell vinaigrette.

41
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,982
(all grunting)

42
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,401
Heads up, Dad. Here comes the scum.

43
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,652
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

44
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:36,030
Why can't they just be happy
for my success?

45
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,033
(all three groaning)

46
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,245
-Hot fudge!
-Yarr, It burns!

47
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:47,333
Oh, great. And I just got all
that gum out of my armpits.

48
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,961
(players grunting)

49
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,343
(crowd cheers)

50
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,221
All right. A people tooth.

51
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:04,976
Gummy Sue, this is your lucky day. There.

52
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,312
Now I is like Britney Spears.

53
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,441
(players grunting)

54
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,359
(goal siren buzzes)

55
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,778
-PLAYER: Yeah!
-(crowd cheering)

56
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,034
(groans)

57
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,452
This is a joke.

58
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:26,748
You'll find me down with the real fans
standing ankle-deep in beer and blood.

59
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,042
Fine. Watch your stupid Eagles concert.

60
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,628
-It's a hockey game.
-Whatever.

61
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,004
(crowd cheers)

62
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,840
Hey, Kozlov!

63
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,258
Aim for the five hole.

64
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,510
He's got an opening
the size of Red Square.

65
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,638
(grunts)

66
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,432
-(goal siren buzzes)
-(crowd cheering)

67
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,185
Thank you, mouthy American child.

68
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,270
Please to take my hockey tree.

69
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,565
Hmm.

70
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,359
Come on, Lisa. It's time to go.

71
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,985
But the game's not even over.

72
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,905
They've already told
the skybox fans who's gonna win.

73
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,282
LISA: Huh?

74
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,244
Yeah! Go, Ice-O-Topes!

75
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,498
This sucks.

76
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,959
How come Lisa gets something and I don't?

77
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:15,380
Because she took the trouble
to wander away and talk to a stranger.

78
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,925
Your sister getting something nice
doesn't hurt you in any way.

79
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,098
HOMER: Hmm. Better add some more nails.

80
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,600
Perfect.

81
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,108
(ravenous growl)

82
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,074
(yawns)

83
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,496
Well, cock-a-diddily-doo.

84
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:52,292
What a Marge-alicious way
to start my Flander-rific day.

85
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,376
Wha...

86
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,172
Hey, Ma, our crap shack's going to hell.

87
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,258
Bart, watch your potty mouth.

88
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,220
Hey! Get out! I'm in here!

89
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,722
Oh.

90
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,142
I think we might have termites.

91
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,604
(squeaks)

92
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,232
These are no ordinary termites.

93
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,402
What you've got here
are Russian No-wood-niks.

94
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,029
Can you save our house?

95
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,699
OK. But in order to kill
these bugs, I've got to live like a bug,

96
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,826
think like a bug, become a bug.

97
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,750
Ugh. Why do you always hire
the cheapest guy?

98
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,461
I go by how funny the sign is.

99
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,631
(lever squeaking)

100
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,137
Sweet. A circus.

101
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,056
Let's sneak in.

102
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,849
That's using your noodle.

103
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,393
(all laughing)

104
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,854
(thudding)

105
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,984
(boys humming circus music)

106
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,403
So when can we go back in our house?

107
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,864
Not for a while, I'm afraid.

108
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,616
I had to use the good poison.

109
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,285
It comes with James Coburn's
picture on the bottle.

110
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,996
This place won't be inhabitable
for another six months.

111
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,415
-But where will we live?
-Don't worry.

112
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,960
We'll just hang out in front of the house
beside these garbage cans.

113
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,129
The time will just fly by.

114
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,007
<i>(King of the Hill </i>theme music playing)

115
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,148
Uh, that was boring. Let's get a hotel.

116
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,320
Don't you have any rooms?

117
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,989
We can't live in our house for six months.

118
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,617
Sorry, folks. Every hotel room
in town is booked.

119
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,286
Stupid bran producers convention.

120
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,955
I'm just gonna say it.

121
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,833
We haven't had a good idea
since Raisin Bran.

122
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,001
(indistinct chattering)

123
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,003
-Let him speak!
-No! He's crazy!

124
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,880
Why don't we stay at a youth hostel?

125
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,342
I do not want another lecture
from a German backpacker

126
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,095
about how we don't appreciate
the National Park System.

127
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:14,267
I know. We'll stay with
my very best friend in the world. Lenny.

128
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,309
(buzzes)

129
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,062
Hey, Simpsons.

130
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,730
That's Lenny?

131
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,275
Oh, I wanted the black one.

132
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,693
Wow, Lenny.

133
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,070
Your apartment is stunning.

134
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,364
So how do you afford such a sweet pad?

135
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,116
(rumbling)

136
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,161
-What the hell was that?
-Oh, I share a common wall

137
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,620
with a jai alai court.

138
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,289
(Simpsons yell)

139
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,459
Ha-ha-ha. That's the sound of
the pelota hitting the fronton.

140
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,002
I find it soothing.

141
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,922
(sighs)

142
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,677
Thanks for letting us stay with you.

143
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,179
Oh, please, it is such an honor

144
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:55,433
to host our favorite family. And you came
at an exciting time.

145
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,269
I'm chairing a meeting
of the Galactic U.N.

146
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:02,148
My apologies. The paint is still wet
on Ambassador Farfoon.

147
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,903
We are not staying at Moe's.

148
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,865
Maggie's already drunk on the fumes.
And she's a mean drunk.

149
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,743
(Bart whimpers)

150
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,954
Come on, guys. You gotta stay.
Tonight's the big cockfight.

151
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,122
We can eat the loser.

152
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,500
Pfft. Who wants to eat a loser?

153
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,668
Dad, we have to find a place soon.

154
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,838
I really have to go to the bathroom,
and I'm out of tokens.

155
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,840
You know, I heard of a new reality show

156
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,176
where they let you live
in a home for free.

157
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,763
Oh, yeah. The gimmick is
it's a house from 1895.

158
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,765
And you gotta do everything
like they did back then.

159
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,725
1895? Forget it.

160
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,978
We'd be too late to save Lincoln
and too early to save Kennedy.

161
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,232
-You could save McKinley.
-It's not a time machine, Moe.

162
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,817
HOMER: Marge,
I'm still not sure about this.

163
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,237
MARGE: Hey, if TV can give
Mike O'Malley a home,

164
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,738
it can give us one.

165
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,659
Welcome to the Reality Channel.

166
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:58,329
Hi. I'm Mitch Hartwell,
creator of <i>The 1895 Challenge.</i>

167
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:02,500
And by creator, I mean I saw it
on Dutch television and tweaked the title.

168
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,878
Well, this family
looks pretty interesting.

169
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,797
But isn't the dad Bill Cosby?

170
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,841
You see, I gotta get back on the TV

171
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,845
'cause with <i>The Osbournes</i>
and the soft-core porns

172
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,474
and the dogs pooping
and nobody scooping and the...

173
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,393
(mumbling indistinctly)

174
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,480
We need a family
that hasn't been on TV forever.

175
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,690
Let's try the Simpsons.

176
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,694
I like what I'm seeing in there.

177
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,949
-(pretends choking)
-I'll teach you to whistle on the Sabbath!

178
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,034
They go to pieces over nothing.

179
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,078
They're perfect for reality TV.

180
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,373
Where's that kid with my latte?

181
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,708
(gasps)

182
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,003
He's not coming, is he?

183
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,212
Is he?

184
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,131
(crying)

185
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,263
Welcome to your home
for the next six months.

186
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,432
Oh, man. I can't wear this.

187
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,309
I look like Buster Brown.

188
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,768
Whoever that is.

189
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,980
Oh, you look adorable, Lisa.

190
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:10,026
Your school chums are going to be
so jealous of your little outfit.

191
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,905
God, I wish I had that little outfit.

192
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,576
Yeah. Those golden curls are to die for.

193
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,244
(floorboards squeaking)

194
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,248
Wow, they had an Army helmet
under every bed?

195
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,753
Uh, Mr. Simpson, that's a chamber pot.

196
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,254
You're supposed to go
to the bathroom in it.

197
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,214
Befoul an Army helmet?

198
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,800
You'd like that, wouldn't you, hippie?

199
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,511
Behind this door,
you'll find the one piece

200
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,222
of 21st century technology
in the whole house.

201
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,517
Ooh, please be a melon baller.
Please be a melon baller.

202
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,313
This is your video confessional.

203
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,982
You come in here to express
your deepest feelings

204
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,442
and darkest secrets.

205
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,321
Uh, ha, ha. My hair isn't really blue.

206
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,074
(gasps) I need that tape!

207
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,496
Good morning, ladies.

208
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,289
What's so good about it?

209
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:09,418
It takes six hours to make breakfast now.

210
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,379
Hey, you should see
how much trouble Dad's having

211
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,672
shaving with a straight razor.

212
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,757
(whistling)

213
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,678
Finally. I'm no longer a slave
to the Gillette corporation.

214
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:25,267
Why, it says here
that President Cleveland has...

215
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,187
(groans)

216
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,398
(engine backfiring)

217
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:34,402
OK, more coal. Less coal.
Less, less. More.

218
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,029
Less, less, less.

219
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,447
And none.

220
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,450
Perfect.

221
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,245
By orders of The Reality Channel,
I must make sure

222
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,081
that you only buy items available in 1895.

223
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,793
Oreos? Sorry, these are from 1896.

224
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,130
Non-scarring toilet paper. Ha. Dream on.

225
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,049
Urkel-O's. Delicious but forbidden.

226
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,135
I'll just take these tampons.

227
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,721
I don't believe they had those in 1895.

228
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,598
-Yes, they did. Look closer.
-Ooh!

229
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,392
Twenty-three skidoo.

230
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,103
You know, it's 6:15.

231
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,857
The kids are in bed
and Maggie's in her cage.

232
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,944
Maybe I could wuther your heights?

233
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,946
Well, OK.

234
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,489
Blow out that lamp

235
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,659
and I'll take off
my Victorian undergarments.

236
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,580
-HOMER: All right, let me get that.
-MARGE: Remember, if you just...

237
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,789
(ripping)

238
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,708
HOMER: Just... That comes off.

239
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,709
(clanking)

240
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,793
MARGE: That's... No. Up.

241
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,003
(grinding)

242
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,213
HOMER: All right.
Let's see what we've got here.

243
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,383
Almost done.

244
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,928
This has been the worst week of my life.

245
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,639
I miss my toys, my video games.

246
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,225
"Mutt and Jeff" comics are not funny.

247
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,227
They're gay, I get it.

248
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,562
(knocking)

249
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,397
HOMER: You've been in there over an hour!

250
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,649
Other people
have to confess too, you know.

251
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,068
Oh, I can't hold it in.

252
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,403
I hate this house!

253
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,574
Ugh. Bread tastes like clothes.

254
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,451
I'm so cold.

255
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:09,330
All of you stink so much.

256
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,333
This is great television.

257
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:16,003
Yeah. I can't wait to see
which one of them dies first.

258
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:19,173
Look, we can't give up. We're on TV.

259
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,216
And when you're on TV,

260
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,177
you dig in your claws
and you never let go.

261
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,221
Just like Bill Moyers.

262
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,815
(beeping)

263
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,193
Telegram for Haywood U. Cuddlemee.

264
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,445
Haywood U. Cuddlemee?

265
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,366
Big guy in the back,
Haywood U. Cuddlemee? Hey... Oh.

266
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,035
Ooh, that little... Ooh.

267
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:51,247
I'm gonna drive a golden spike

268
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,167
where your Union meets
your Central Pacific. Stop.

269
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,585
(laughing)

270
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,943
Aw.

271
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,736
Bart, honey, would you like

272
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,030
-some more cod liver oil?
-Yes, Mom.

273
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,116
(gulps)

274
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,411
I thought I was regular before,
but I was wrong.

275
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,581
With all this hard work, I'm too tired
to worry about the world.

276
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,207
And soon, I will marry

277
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,543
one of father's
wealthy business associates.

278
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:41,046
Oh, I wish you would reconsider
the proposal of Hiram Beatwife.

279
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,507
<i>He's betrothed to Martha Takeapunch.</i>

280
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,426
This is boring.

281
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,012
Yeah. Switch it to
the Elderly Animal Channel.

282
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,639
(lions groaning)

283
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,059
(groans)

284
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,105
(weak growl)

285
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,734
(groans)

286
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,487
The show's getting boring.
We're losing viewers.

287
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,241
I have an idea. It's crazy,
but it just might work.

288
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,744
Like it did last week on another show.

289
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:15,998
We bring in the biggest, most famous star
from a '70s sitcom

290
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,083
whose phone hasn't been disconnected.

291
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,460
(gasps)

292
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,921
-Hello.
-Squiggy?

293
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:27,009
Why is the guy from <i>Laverne & Shirley</i>
living in our house?

294
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,720
Because nobody's watching you clowns.

295
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:33,724
If you was to ask me,
you're all too calm and happy.

296
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,685
The essence of drama is conflict.

297
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,687
That's why they gave me this Taser.

298
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,315
(Homer yells)

299
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:45,486
This still isn't working. Fixing this show
is gonna take some original thinking.

300
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,822
Everybody, pull out your TVs
and start flipping around.

301
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,410
I think I've got an idea.

302
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,787
Turn to channel 24.

303
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,872
ALL: Hmm.

304
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,457
(snoring)

305
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,503
Hello, Laverne.

306
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,964
Hello, Laverne.

307
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,429
Hello, Laverne.

308
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,477
Marge, I'm off to the blacksmith's
to get my tooth pulled.

309
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,229
(yells)

310
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,066
(gasping)

311
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,985
Oh. Lisa. Explain.

312
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,195
I guess the network
made our show more exciting

313
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,780
by dumping the house in a river.

314
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:33,283
Marge, throw me an old-timey rope
in an old-timey way!

315
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,246
(grunts) This rope was woven
from handlebar mustaches.

316
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,872
(grunting)

317
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,332
(groaning)

318
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,713
You monsters. You turned this show
into a <i>Survivor </i>clone.

319
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:49,341
Mr. Simpson, your contract
allows us to do anything we want to you.

320
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,844
I would never sign that.

321
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,055
Unless there was a red sticker
that said sign here.

322
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,598
Uh-huh. That's what we used.

323
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,392
Where do you get those things, anyway?

324
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,893
-(indistinct banging)
-(shudders)

325
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,396
(Lisa and Homer yelling)

326
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,234
(all screaming)

327
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,155
(whimpering)

328
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,117
(panting)

329
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,749
Oh, no. Everything is ruined.

330
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,669
Our good bellows, our stereopticon.

331
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,171
Squiggy.

332
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,590
(gasps)

333
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,716
Homer, your strop.

334
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,218
Your strop.

335
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,928
(sobs)

336
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,222
Our lives are ruined.

337
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,893
Oh, yeah. This is great stuff.
Let's take lunch, people.

338
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,353
-Do we get lunch?
-We're not allowed to interfere...

339
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,855
with the reality of the show.

340
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,316
Which reminds me, burn the leftovers.
Leave nothing.

341
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,862
I can't remember the last time
I cried like this.

342
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,531
When you put your T-shirt on backwards?

343
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,076
Oh, yes.

344
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,536
The tag chafed my throat.

345
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,539
(crying)

346
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,832
Let's go eat some bugs.

347
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,215
Is it just me or are you guys getting sick
of crazy adventures?

348
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,674
MAN: Psst. Psst.

349
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:20,182
Savages. I'll handle this, Marge.

350
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,143
We come in peace.

351
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,604
-We take your land.
-We're not savages.

352
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:29,233
-I'm a paralegal from Cleveland.
-And I'm a nutritionist from Santa Fe.

353
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:33,278
We were a tribe on another reality show,
but we lost the final challenge.

354
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,073
I just couldn't eat
anymore kangaroo testicles.

355
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,117
So the show just abandoned us here.

356
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,202
The weird part is,
now I can't get enough of them.

357
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,995
But now we're going to escape.

358
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,623
We're gonna overpower your crew
and return to civilization.

359
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,836
Wow. Marge, I think I figured out
their primitive language.

360
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,420
That's my Homie.

361
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,339
(all chomping)

362
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,133
Is it so gosh-darn hard

363
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,802
to get cocktail sauce
in the middle of the Amazon?

364
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:57,886
(yelling)

365
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,185
(gagging)

366
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,113
(screams)

367
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,950
Geez, now we know what it feels like
to be tormented.

368
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,368
And yet I learn nothing.

369
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,624
(grunts)

370
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,836
And now to wreck
their precious helicopter!

371
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,839
No, Homer, no! That's our only way home.

372
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,550
Yes, but... OK.

373
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,010
(grunting)

374
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,219
Whoa.

375
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,262
(straining)

376
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,974
That Lenny sure had a crazy apartment.

377
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,225
(cracking)

378
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,771
Oh, it sure is good to be home.

379
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,815
No more reality shows for us.

380
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,735
Let's watch some quality,
scripted television.

381
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,403
<i>(Law & Order </i>theme music playing)

382
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,613
NARRATOR: <i>Law & Order...</i>

383
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,116
<i>Elevator Inspectors Unit.</i>

384
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:17,049
Here's the thing, inspector.
The button for five doesn't light up.

385
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,342
I think I'm gonna be sick.

386
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,385
Oh, that's it.

387
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,638
TV was the one good thing in my life

388
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,640
and now I can't enjoy it anymore.

389
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,849
Hmm.

390
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:29,144
I guess we'll have to find a new way
to entertain ourselves.

391
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,354
What about books?

392
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,398
Yeah. If we read books,
we could form a club.

393
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,776
If we formed a club,
we could serve drinks.

394
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,612
Hey, Dad. Why don't we watch you
drink from a hose?

395
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,030
Good idea, Lisa.

396
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,784
Hmm. The water's off.

397
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,453
I'll use my eye
to see what the trouble is.

398
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,872
-(Homer yells)
-(all laughing)

399
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,374
Hmm. Off again.

400
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,209
Maybe I can hear what's going on.

401
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,585
(yells)

402
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,840
So this has become a game of wits, has it?

403
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,593
<i>Perhaps my other eye</i>
<i>will get to the bottom of this.</i>

404
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,970
-(water gushes)
-(Homer yells)

405
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,846
(all laughing)

406
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,932
(theme music playing)

407
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,263
Shh!

408
