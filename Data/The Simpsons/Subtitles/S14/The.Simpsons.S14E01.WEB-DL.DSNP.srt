1
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:06,256
Ha, ha, I don't know, neighbor-inos.
I'm all for Halloween fun

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,926
but a seance sounds a little PG-13.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,512
But this is your chance
to contact your late wife, Maude.

4
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,806
Well, I do miss the missus.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:21,229
Maude Flanders, we the living beseech you
to appear.

6
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,314
BART (as Maude): Ned...

7
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,316
I'm back.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,944
Give me a kiss.

9
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:28,987
(all screaming)

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,573
(in normal voice)
Chill out, dudes. It's me, Bart Simpson.

11
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:32,866
(whimpering)

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,784
What are you looking at?

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,454
(wailing)

14
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,538
(all screaming)

15
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:42,625
Maude. You still look as pretty
as the day I buried you.

16
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,918
(purrs)

17
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,588
Are you ready for tales

18
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:50,842
that will shatter your spine
and boil your blood?

19
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:55,472
-Well, duh.
-Then choke on these!

20
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,059
(laughing maniacally)

21
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,979
(Homer screaming)

22
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,413
Now to spend some quality time
away from my family.

23
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,249
(sighs)

24
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,253
I've got a list of things
for you to do today.

25
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,215
-My favorite is number three.
-Oh, I'd love to.

26
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,717
But someone made me too many pancakes

27
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,886
and now I have to sleep them off.

28
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,764
Oh, those were for the Church breakfast.

29
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,265
Were they now?

30
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,017
(grunts)

31
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,185
(groans)

32
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,231
Hammocks. Get your hammocks.

33
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,943
The hammock man. I'm glad
he's a little early today.

34
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,780
The price is $10.

35
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:57,575
But I must warn you,
this is no ordinary hammock.

36
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,746
Its webbing is a mesh of comfort and evil.

37
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,081
You had me at "comfort."

38
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:09,963
Mm-hmm. Hmm, Mr. Hammock,
say hello to Madam Ass.

39
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,714
(grunting)

40
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,174
(shouting)

41
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,805
What the... It made another me.

42
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,682
How cool is that?

43
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,017
(groans)

44
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,312
Hmm, no bellybutton.

45
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,730
Shuttle's in the hangar.

46
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,607
You wanna be my slave?

47
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,442
(moaning indistinctly)

48
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,986
Outstanding.

49
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,072
-Oh, uh... Mm-hmm.
-(electricity crackling)

50
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,448
Speed it up, ugly.

51
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,075
-(Homer clone screams)
-(thuds)

52
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,829
(Homer grunts)

53
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,956
Eh, he had a good run.

54
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,126
(grunting)

55
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,588
I'm gonna need help with this. Hmm.

56
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,884
(grunting)

57
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,303
(laughs)

58
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,345
(slurps)

59
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,514
Beer for me?

60
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,641
No, you've got chores to do.

61
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,144
Chores? Me need clone.

62
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,189
Clone? That's ridiculous.

63
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,899
Where am I supposed to find a...

64
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,650
Wait a minute.

65
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,279
(grunting)

66
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,907
Wow, four of me.

67
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,993
I think this could be a magic hammock.

68
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,539
And it just might be the answer
to my problems.

69
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,791
-Uh...
-MARGE: What do you think, Homer?

70
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,585
Does this make my hips look big?

71
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,879
(in monotone voice)
Outfit good, flatters butt.

72
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,964
Oh, aren't you a dear?

73
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,426
Then after World War II,
it got kind of quiet

74
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:42,847
till Superman challenged FDR
to a race around the world.

75
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,558
FDR beat him by a furlong.

76
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,353
Or so the comic books
would have you believe.

77
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,064
The truth lies somewhere in between...

78
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,524
(snoring)

79
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,613
(Homer grunts)

80
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,073
(grunts)

81
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,950
Me good dad.

82
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,996
Hmm. Does Dad seem
a little dumber than usual?

83
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,167
Me not notice.

84
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,963
Homie, you've been
such a sweetheart today.

85
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,047
Let's go upstairs and...

86
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,091
(whispers)

87
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,384
(chuckles)

88
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,386
(grunts)

89
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,597
-I'll take it from here, fake-o.
-Uh-uh.

90
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,140
-Uh-huh. Unh!
-Unh!

91
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,227
(in unison) Why you little... Aah!

92
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,020
Man, are we evenly matched.

93
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,188
Me concur.

94
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,607
(both gagging)

95
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,443
-(yells)
-(laughs)

96
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,947
It would take three clones
to beat the original Homer.

97
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,407
ALL: Hmm.

98
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,117
Huh, I mean four.

99
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,744
-ALL: Oh.
-Suckers.

100
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,582
(chattering)

101
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,712
MARGE: Kids, your father
made us breakfast.

102
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,297
BART AND LISA: Yay!

103
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,632
-Go, go, go.
-OK.

104
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,635
(kids munching)

105
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,930
Say, Homer, I was, uh...

106
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,475
I was wondering if I could borrow
that chainsaw you, uh, stole from me.

107
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,561
Yeah, but you have to leave a credit card.

108
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,230
-No problem. Discover OK?
-Ned.

109
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,357
OK, here's my Amex.

110
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,445
(grunts)

111
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,946
Mm-hm.

112
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,744
Homie, I must say you have the energy
of 20 men lately.

113
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,037
Twenty-three.

114
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,457
Now, today, I'm gonna mow the lawn,
do my taxes, shoot hoops with Bart

115
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,625
and girl it up with Lisa.

116
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,918
Aw.

117
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,715
-(yelps)
-(door slams)

118
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,092
(groaning)

119
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,678
Oh, I gotta get rid of these guys.

120
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,597
(tires squeal)

121
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,225
Now, before I abandon you
in this cornfield,

122
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,436
does anyone remember the way home?

123
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,645
I do.

124
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,105
-(fires)
-(body thuds)

125
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,315
Anybody else?

126
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,526
Anybody else?

127
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,070
Come on.

128
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:05,740
OK, everyone out.

129
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,451
(all grunting)

130
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:13,706
Now to make sure this hammock
never troubles anyone again.

131
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,707
(grunts)

132
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,958
(tires screeching)

133
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,669
Ooh. Mm?

134
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,172
(groans)

135
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,095
(chattering)

136
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,143
Let's all go out for some frosty
chocolate milk shakes.

137
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,773
(all moaning)

138
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:46,948
Ah, look at that corn. Old Gil's hard work
is finally paying off.

139
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,117
(munching)

140
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,413
Well, at least I got my health.

141
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,291
Aw.

142
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,002
CLONES: Beer, beer, beer.
Beer, beer, beer.

143
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,006
-(cans ripping open)
-(clones gulping)

144
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,468
(clones babbling)

145
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,886
(pants unzipping)

146
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,180
(clones sighing)

147
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,474
<i>Like comedy clubs in the late '80s,</i>

148
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,102
<i>these ravenous clones are everywhere.</i>

149
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,813
<i>They've destroyed every building in town</i>

150
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,941
<i>except Moe's Tavern, which is reporting</i>
<i>record business.</i>

151
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,401
(chattering)

152
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,610
(gulping)

153
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,029
Now, uh, who's gonna be
picking up the tab?

154
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,948
ALL: Lenny.

155
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,992
Anything for Homers.

156
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:34,162
Dad, is there something
you'd like to tell us about this horde?

157
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,830
You'd think so, but no.

158
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,417
They look like you, they were rude
to Patty and Selma,

159
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,337
and the horde has been
describes very gassy.

160
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,755
Yeah, it's a good group.

161
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,091
Currently the, uh, Vietcong--

162
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,344
I mean, the, uh, Homers
are occupying these areas.

163
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,096
By tomorrow...

164
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,100
(all shuddering)

165
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,352
Good God, we're doomed.

166
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,104
No!

167
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,024
We're out of doughnuts.

168
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,319
That's it. I know exactly
what we should do.

169
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,528
Thank God.

170
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,989
And you said we shouldn't let little girls
in the war room.

171
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,657
Look, I was wrong, OK?

172
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,916
(all gasping)

173
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,960
ALL: Mm, doughnuts.

174
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,879
Want doughnut.

175
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,881
-Doughnut.
-Chocolate.

176
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,633
(all screaming)

177
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,928
ALL: D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!

178
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,138
HOMER CLONE: Son of a...

179
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,390
D'oh!

180
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,270
Thank you, General. That's a big relief.

181
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,147
The horde is almost dead.

182
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,316
There's still some writhing and twitching.

331
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,790
Can you recommend some activities?

332
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:43,419
Well, one activity you might enjoy
is not asking questions.

333

(laughs)

334
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,882
But man's inquisitive nature
is what separates us from the animals.

335
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,801
And why must we be separated, dammit?

336
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,636
Think what Shakespeare
might've accomplished

337
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,179
if he'd had the eyes of an eagle

338
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,056
or could spray stink on his critics.

339
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,768
Now, who'd like some turkey?
It's a lovely nerd...

340
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,937
(laughs) I mean "bird."

342
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,400
No! Wait a minute now.

343
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,611
Guess what, I'm dying, ha, ha...

344
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,864
...with the basting and the butterballing

345
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,950
and the chestnut stuffing in my pupik.

346
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,536
Gobble, gobble, gobble. Death.

347
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:23,083
Homie, something very creepy
is going on here.

348
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,461
You mean they're gonna try
to sell us timeshares?

349
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,421
I think I'm going to do
a little sleuthing.

350
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,547
Bring back some ice.

351
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,717
(people shouting nearby)

352
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,263

you pay the bill.

00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,404
(purrs)

359
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:56,617
Unh. What's up, honey?
Want a little loving?

360
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,119
(purrs)

361
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,621
Woo-hoo, quite a tiger there.

362
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,791
Easy, easy. Ha, ha,
I guess it has been a while.

363
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,876
OK, that hurts more than it tickles.

364
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,628
(Marge purring)

365
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,088
Quiet, youse.

366
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,173
-(thuds)
-(Marge yelps)

367
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,926
Isn't vacation sex always the best?

368
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,011
(growls in agreement)

369
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,430
Marge, you were like a wild beast.

370
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,224
So voracious and prowly.

371
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:24,019
And I've never seen you
use your tail like that.

372
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,187
(bird chirps)

373
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,605
(growls)

374
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:31,110
What the... Oh, my God.
She's become a monster.

375
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,780
Which I have to admit, I sort of suspected
during the sex.

376
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,491
(groans)

377
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,743
Gotta find a way to change Marge back.

378
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,037
And replace the M&M'S I took
from the minibar.

379
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,872
NED: Hey, Homer.

380
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,165
Flanders.

381
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,876
Oh, a perfect vacation ruined.

382
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,088
Hate to be a needy Neddy,
but could you do me a favor?

383
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,299
-Hmm.
-Milk me.

384
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,386
Uh, I really don't wanna do that, Ned.

385
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,472
Oh, come on, Homer. All I'm asking
is for you to yank my teats

386
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,808
-and harvest my milk.
-Ugh, fine.

387
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,354
Ooh, that's nice.

388
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,148
You're actually quite
gentle when you wanna be.

389
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,732
You know, you're not helping.

390
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,194
<i>♪ In the jungle the jungle,</i>
<i>the creepy jungle ♪</i>

391
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,613
<i>♪ Homer rides a freak ♪</i>

392
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,823
Shh. Hey.

393
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,867
(indistinct chattering)

394
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,160
Huh! What's that?

395
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,124
(grunts)

396
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,334
(squeaks)

397
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,795
I'm a dog.

398
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,715
(blows horn)

399
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,967
Hear me, accursed brethren.

400
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,889
I understand that some of you
are still wearing tattered pants.

401
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,183
Please, throw them on the bonfire

402
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,476
and embrace your animal essence.

403
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,398
OK, but I'm keeping the tattered vest.
I still have my dignity.

404
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,691
Hey, slops.

405
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,236
Ooh, a toenail. Ha, ha.

406
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,572
I can't believe it.

407
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,241
Hibbert's turned you all
into human guinea pigs.

408
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,702
We prefer "Italian-American pigs."

409
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,078
Hey, Dad, check it out.

410
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,043
"Eat my shorts"? Why, you little...

411
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,754
Maggie.

412
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,050
Lisa. Ugh!

413
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,551
We were just playing.

414
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,802
What game?

415
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,179
Let's Eat Maggie.

416
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,889
(grunts)

417
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,558
Manimals, inverta-broads.

418
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,311
You must fight back against
the one who did this to you.

419
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,856
Yar, the half-man, half-gorilla
speaks the truth.

420
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,483
(all grunt in agreement)

421
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,278
(laughing)

422
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,656
Now, I admit I made a few mistakes,

423
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,366
but all in the name of progress.

424
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,742
Hear, hear.

425
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,870
-It's Mr. Burns.
-With a fox attitude.

426
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,081
Think about it, my hideous children.

427
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,917
Aren't you better off now
than you were as humans?

428
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,794
<i>Me gusto </i>pollen.

429
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:57,172
Disco Shrew can still boogaloo.

430
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,925
(disco music playing)

431
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,843
(all groan in disgust)

432
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,720
You guys are nuts.

433
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,515
All you can do is eat and sleep

434
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,518
and mate, and roll around
in your own filth

435
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,396
and mate and eat-- Where do I sign up?

436
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,608
(bird chirps)

437
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,069
So how do you like being a walrus, Dad?

438
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:22,114
It's great. I haven't been
this skinny since high school.

439
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:26,326
Homie, someone owes me a back scratch.

440
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,037
(groans in pleasure)

441
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,128
Look at that island
shaped like our number four.

442
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,504
Makes you think.

443
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,265
(theme music playing
in tune of space music)

444
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,889
-(indistinct screeching)
-(organ music playing)
