WOMAN: <i>Welcome to another</i>

10
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,748
This was today?

11
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,750
The girl was supposed to call.

12
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,002
Oh, let's get this over with.

13
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,130
Here's the recliner where

14
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,631
Don Adams and Shelley Winters...

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,675
made beautiful music together.

16
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,054
It should be in a museum,
but museums don't want it.

17
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,431
And here's my pool.

18
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:59,267
I don't swim, so that's where
I throw my shrimp shells.

19
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,021
Krustofski.

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,066
Why, look, it's my celebrity neighbor,
Elliott Gould.

21
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,151
Your monkey bit my kid again.

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,114
Well, if he would stop wearing
the banana suntan lotion...

23
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,910
-Say hello to Bob, and Carol.
-(groans)

24
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,745
-And Ted and Alice.
-(groans)

25
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,246
KRUSTY: Oh, that's it, Gould.

26
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,166
<i>And you keep your lousy dog off my lawn.</i>

27
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,210

"I have a crush on Kenny."

30
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,841
Ha! That's me.

31
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,260
You would like me, loser.

32
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,137

Turbo Diary, I love that I bought you.

00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,828
Hey, I could really use one of those.

42
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,454
No arguments here.

43
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,374
Man, I really come off
like a jerk in this thing.

44
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,375
(Marge humming)

45
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,294
Mom, Dad, my birthday's coming up

46
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,548
and Girltech Turbo Diaries
are in stores now.

47
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,883
Lisa, nobody likes a shill.

48
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,719
-Just buy me the frigging toy.
-(chuckles)

49
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,055
I love that little shill.

50
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,558
-Let's get her that diary.
-I agree.

51
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,560
A girl should have her own private diary.

52
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,562
I had to share mine with my uncle.

53
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,318
HOMER: Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

54
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,529
Dad, you can't eat all those free samples.

55
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,072
We've gotta get Lisa's present.

56
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,323
Watch and learn.

57
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,242
(growling and snorting)

58
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,586
More free samples.

59
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,588
Dad, you ate all the free samples.

60
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,715
Now you're eating men's slacks.

61
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,010
Eh, it's still better than Indian food.

62
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,846
Oh.

63
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,559
One Turbo Diary, please.

64
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,562
Trying to keep those
crushes secret, eh, Romeo?

65
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,981
It's not for me. I'm not a girl like you.

66
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,609
Well played. Oh.

67
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,360
I'm sorry, sir, but I just sold

68
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,404
the last Turbo Diary to that guy.

69
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,822
Finally, Smithers,

70
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,950
a device worthy of storing
my top-secret enemies list.

71
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:21,993
I'm ready, sir.

72
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:26,080
Number one, the Kingston Trio.
Ugh. Number two...

Oh. Now what am I gonna get Lisa?

76
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,465
Sir, I can offer you
this Tickle Me Krusty...

77
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,218
the most popular toy of 1999.

78
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,177
(squeaks)

79
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,971

<i>I wonder what mommy's</i>

82
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,560
Lisa's not gonna want that.

83
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,021
Oh, what can I get her?

84
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:56,694
Shop of the morning, Homer.
Just call me Mall Flanders.

85
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,196
(chuckles)

86
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,365
What are you buying? Jerk stuff?

87
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,616
Oh, you betcha.

88
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,993
This kiosk sells personalized movies.

89
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,246
I had one made starring little Rod.

90
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,041
NARRATOR: <i>Kiosk Productions presents...</i>

91
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:13,920
<i>an outer space adventure starring you.</i>

92
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,172
<i>One day while flying your spaceship,</i>

93
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,467
<i>you saw a planet and decided to land.</i>

94
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,096

95
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,681

96
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,807
(Flander's voice) Rod.

97
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,267
Welcome, earthling.

98
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,185
What are your hobbies?

99
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,479
(narrator's voice) My hobbies include...

100
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,064
(Flander's voice) Being quiet during trips

101
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,525
clapping with songs, and diabetes.

102
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,402
Sounds like fun!

103
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,778
Let's party!

104
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,488
(lively, canned tune plays)

105
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,617
Hey, your kid is in the movie!

106
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,244
And the movie knows his name!

107
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,705
Maybe Lisa will like this
better than the diary.

108
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,374
Stupid Flanders, you're a genius.

109
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,962
A laser pointer.

110
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,755
Thanks, Bart.

111
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,840
It's really cool.

112
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,800
You can point a red dot
at people's crotches

113
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,051
from really far away.

114
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,015
Hmm.

115
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,976
There appears to be a red dot
on my trouser fronts.

116
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,312
I'd better lower them. (sighs)

117
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,814
The dot also appears
to be on my underpants.

118
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,065
Well, down they go.

119
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,859
(police siren)

120
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,027
Hey, buddy,

121
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,195
you better get that red dot checked out.

122
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,323
My uncle died of crotch dot.

123
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,449
OK, Lisa.

124
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,868
Now, open the present
from your father and me.

125
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,369
Hmm, hmm.

126
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,748
I wonder what this could be.

127
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:36,210
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

128
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,129
Could it be some kind of book?

129
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,173
Well, yes and no.

130
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:42,800
Mostly no.

131
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:43,885
What?

132
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:48,056
You were supposed
to get her that stupid diary!

133
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,099
But it's a personalized video

134
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,560
about my favorite little star--

135
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,145
Lisa Simpson.

136
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,773
Well, this could be fun.

137
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,566
Let's watch it.

138
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,028
(tinny music plays)

139
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,112
(female voice) Howdy, pardners.

140
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,489
My name is Sheriff...

141
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,823
(Homer's voice) Lisa Simpson.

142
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,034
I sure am hungry for my favorite food...

143
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,160
(Homer's voice) McNuggets.

144
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,453
I don't like McNuggets.

145
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,871
I'm a vegetarian!

146
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:12,955
Still?

147
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,249
Then you're not going to like
your other present.

148
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,210
(cowboy theme plays)

149
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,544
(female voice) Why, it's my best friend...

150
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,545
(Homer's voice) Maggie.

151
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,838
Huh?

152
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,382
Bad news, Sheriff...

153
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,633
(Homer's voice) Lisa Simpson.

154
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,760
Some Indians took all the...

155
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,844
(Homer's voice) McNuggets.

156
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,930
<i>Mm, McNuggets.</i>

157
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,391
(Homer groaning happily)

158
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,393
(female voice)
I'll get those no-good Indians.

159
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,853
Just as sure as my favorite book is...

160
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,188
(Homer's voice) Magazines!

161
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,565
(Homer snoring)

162
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,858
BART: Wake up, Dad.

163
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:41,984
(Homer's voice) Huh? What?

164
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,322
Dad! That information is all wrong!

165
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,075
Maggie's a baby, not my best friend.

166
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,243
(crying)

167
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,661
You don't know anything about me!

168
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,703
(sobbing)

169
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,123
-Wh...
-(door slamming)

170
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,374
Maggie, you're her best friend.

171
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,417
Go talk to her.

172
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,918
(thudding)

173
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,338
Oh, what have I done?

174
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,592
Children don't remember
bad birthdays, do they?

175
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,636
(sighs)

176
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,599
Good morning, honey.

177
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,893
Did you cry out all your angries?

178
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,645
I don't think so.

179
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,730
Oh, Lisa's still mad at me.

180
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,731
I'm still mad at you

181
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,859
for chopping up my skateboard with an axe.

182
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,111
I did it for the insurance money.

183
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,237
Huh!

184
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,989
Look, Lisa, I'm still trying

185
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,365
to get to know you.

186
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,200
-(horn honks)
-Who's your favorite Traveling Wilbury?

187
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,828
Is it Jeff Lynne?

188
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,289
Dad, you've had eight years
to get to know me.

189
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,707
It's too late.

190
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,834
(tires screech)

191
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,878
But I'm full of questions.

192
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,629
What's your favorite cigar size?

193
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,466
Is it Robusto? Is it?

194
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,635
LENNY: <i>Gee, Homer...</i>

195
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,095
you sure look sad.

196
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,096
Yeah.

197
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,181
At least you ain't aging

198
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,642
six years for every one
'cause of your cow heart.

199
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,645
Oh, my daughter hates me

200
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,647
because I don't know anything about her.

201
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,441
Ah. Well, whenever

202
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,109
I got to know something about a broad

203
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,527
I use this guy.

204
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,030
This detective is unbelievable.

205
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,531
He can learn more about a chick

206
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,241
by digging through one garbage can

207
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,951
than you could from years of intimacy.

208
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,871
He found out who was cobbling
shoes for me at night.

209
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,165
Turns out I have severe schizophrenia.

210
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,251
Well, if hiring this guy

211
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,046
will make Lisa like me again,
then I'll do it.

212
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,339
Can I get this beer to go?

213
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,632
Sure.

214
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,596
Maybe someday, I'llturn into a swan.

215
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,597
(sighs)

216
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,932
Ah, God.

217
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,016
(jazz theme plays)

218
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,559
(tires squeal)

219
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,896
(electrical buzzing)

220
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,022
(door squeaks)

221
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,443
Drunk Cop?

222
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,444
Is that you?

223
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,071
No. Look lower.

224
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,490
HOMER: Ooh! Pie.

225
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,574
What can I do for you?

226
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,784
My name is Homer Simpson

227
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,369
and I desperately need your help.

228
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,621
Let me guess. It's about a girl.

229
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,081
(gasps) How did you know?

230
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,916
It's always a dame.

231
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,418
Usually, with gams that don't quit...

232
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,838
till they get to the shoes,
and then they're only napping.

233
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,924
(chuckles)

234
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,384
Priceless.

235
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,679
I need you to find out
everything about my daughter

236
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,347
so she'll think I'm a good dad.

237
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,559
OK, I'll get a line on your kid.

238
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,144
I charge 50 bucks a day, plus expenses.

239
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,605
Anything to trick my daughter
into liking me.

240
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,274
Now, if you need to reach me

241
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,277
my e-mail is chunkylover53@aol.

242
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,821
"Chunky... lover... 53?"

243
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:32,863
It's one word.

244
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:33,906
One word.

245
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,366
Chunkylover53.

246
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,617
At AOL.

247
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,119
Dot com.

248
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:45,626
(jazz theme plays)

249
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,794
(camera shutter clicks)

250
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,964
(floor waxer whirring)

251
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,508
Hey, that's not your locker.

252
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,802
You know, you are the spitting image

253
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,679
of the Aberdeen Strangler.

254
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,722
Move along.

255
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,182
(whistling)

256
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,603
I need to see Lisa Simpson's
permanent record.

257
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,730
I'm afraid that
information is confidential.

258
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,649
These are some nice-looking
papers on your desk.

259
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,611
It would be a shame
if somebody <i>shuffled </i>them.

260
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,237
You wouldn't dare.

261
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,655
Oh, wouldn't I?

262
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,368
(scoffs) I could easily put them back
in their original order.

263
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,870
Oh, really?

264
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,627
(echoing scream) No!

265
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,050
You're late, Muntz.

266
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,426
Get bent, Shamus.

267
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,511
I got what you're looking for.

268
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,014
Nice... very nice.

269
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,974
Now give me back what's mine.

270
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,811
(sighs)

271
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,230
My picture with Snow White.

272
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,940
You know, she's just an actress.

273
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:50,983
Shut up!

274
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,069
Some of us prefer illusion to despair.

275
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,320
(horn honks)

276
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,073
Lisa Simpson is a girl at my school.

277
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,241
Yes, yes, you said that already.

278
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,368
What else do you know?

279
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,578
I once picked my nose till it bleeded.

280
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,497
(sighs) About Lisa!

281
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,957
Lisa Simpson is a girl at my school.

282
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,418
Someone's already worked this guy over.

283
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,921
(horn whistling)

284
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,007
Ah, the information I've been waiting for.

285
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,509
So far, so good.

286
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,637
(mumbling)

287
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,391
(gasps) Lisa's pet peeve is <i>phonies?</i>

288
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,142
I thought she loved them!

289
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,313
(jazz playing)

290
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,439
Huh?

291
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,443
Is that Miles Davis' <i>Birth of the Cool?</i>

292
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,861
You should know.

293
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,947
It <i>is your favorite album.</i>

294
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,281
So, you know one thing about me.

295
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,366
Big deal.

296
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,537
-(record scratching)
-HOMER: Wait, wait!

297
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,955
I thought you might like to go

298
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,290
to an animal rights protest today.

299
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,834
Well, maybe.

300
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,420
On the way home we could stop
and get your favorite treat--

301
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,505
ice...

302
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,506
cream.

303
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,007
What do we want?

304
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:00,094
ALL: The gradual phase-out
of animal testing

305
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,138
over the next three years!

306
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,556
When do we want it?

307
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,975
Over the next three years!

308
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,519
Uh, young lady,
why are you protesting today?

309
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,729
Because this lab

310
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,398
is cruelly testing consumer
products on animals.

311
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,858
Take a look for yourself.

312
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,569
They're making monkeys smoke cigarettes...

313
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,241
(exhales)

314
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,326
(contented sigh)

315
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,580
...and look at the way
they've slathered those pigs

316
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,664
with cosmetics!

317
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:34,003
So sad, yet so sexy, yet so delicious.

318
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,546
Mm...

319
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,507
Dad, today was so great.

320
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,259
The animal rights protest,

321
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,095
a visit to the Museum,
of Sadness and Oppression...

322
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,347
Well, we should get along.

323
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,516
I mean, after all, I am your...

324
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,018
father.

325
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,645
How'd you think of such
perfect things for us to do?

326
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,730
Did mom help you?

327
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,816
Mom? Don't you think I could
read the report by myself?

328
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,193
What report?

329
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:01,030
Uh--uh, well, "report" is a daddy word

330
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,365
that means "loves his daughter."

331
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,244
You read the "loves his
daughter" by yourself?

332
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,121
That's right, honey.

333
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,541
(door opens)

334
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,542
You did it!

335
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,211
Lisa thinks I'm the greatest.

336
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,296
I might even put you to work
on Bart and Maggie--

337
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,381
go super-dad on all their asses!

338
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,301
I believe there's still
the matter of my expenses.

339
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,137
Oh, yes. Well, let's take a look and see.

340
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,681
A thousand dollars?

341
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,642
How did you spend $1,000?

342
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,768
It's itemized.

343
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,728
A $40 steak?

344
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,522
Yeah, but if I'd eaten the whole thing

345
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,689
it would've been free.

346
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,025
You've been living like a king
on my dollar.

347
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,778
Super unleaded gas... silver bullets?

348
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,404
Early on I was working under the theory

349
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,781
that your daughter was a werewolf.

350
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,074
It didn't pan out.

351
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,409
I can't believe a man who agreed

352
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,579
to follow my daughter around for money

353
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,748
would turn out to be a dirtbag.

354
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,375
You better pay up, Simpson.

355
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,584
(grunting)

356
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,002
(whimpering)

357
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,758
You'll regret the day
you crossed Dexter Colt!

358
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,843
You'll regret the day

359
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,220
you went to the expensive coffee place!

360
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,055

Monkey Research Labs

365
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,857
where hundreds of test animals

366
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,859
have been freed by unknown activists.

367
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,527
Chief Wiggum, do you have a statement?

368
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,362
Uh, yes. Yes, I do, Kent.

369
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,240
This is a horrible crime, one that...

370
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,533
(laughter)

371
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,909
Cut it out, Lou.

372
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,786
I... he's making funny faces.

373
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,329
Sorry, chief. One of these monkeys

374
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,248
has the same name as my ex-wife.

375
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,333
(laughs)

376
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,878
Chief, do you have any suspects
at this time?

377
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,547
Well, we do have several promising clues.

378
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,633
Ah, let's see... there's
a "Malibu Stacy" scrunchie,

379
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,302
a saxophone reed,

380
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,929
and a book report on <i>The Secret Garden</i>

381
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,264
by Lisa Simpson.

382
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,765
Well, what does this tell you, Chief?

383
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:55,102
Well, apparently, there's a secret garden
in all of us...

384
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,563
and that Lisa Simpson is guilty!

385
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,647
(all gasping)

386
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,024
I was framed!

387
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,609
You believe me, don't you, dad?

388
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,235
Of course, I do.

389
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,196
It's all my fault for refusing to pay--

390
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,450
(nervous laugh) ...pay attention to you.

391
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,577
My sweet little, father-loving

392
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,579
pile of forgiveness.

393
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,830
Yes!

394
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,248
(knocking)

395
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,919
Can Lisa come out with her hands up?

396
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,005
Chief Wiggum,

397
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,216
my daughter is innocent
until proven guilty.

398
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,385
(tires squeal)

399
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,513
Would an innocent person flee?

400
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,975
No, really. Tell me.
I--I honestly don't know.

401
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,101
Chief, no.

402
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,436
Even I knew that.

403
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,022
Yeah, yeah, I'm not... I'm not good.

404
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,945
(sirens wailing)

405
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,696
(tires screeching)

406
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,281
(sirens stop)

407
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,241
Heh, heh. They're trapped.

408
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,539
Oh, damn it!

409
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,712
Oh, I can't stop worrying
about Homer and Lisa.

410
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,922
Aw, Mom.

411
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,882
This will take your mind off them.

412
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,801
(grunts)

413
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,345
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

414
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,597
(humming)

415
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,640
(glass shattering)

416
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,891
NEWSCASTER: <i>Police are looking</i>

417
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,018
<i>for a bald man in blue pants</i>

418
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,479
<i>and a fair-haired girl in a red lampshade.</i>

419
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,774
Blackening our hair was a great idea, Dad.

420
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,193
I look just like a Powerpuff Girl.

421
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,362
I look just like Elvis.

422
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,407
(groans)

423
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,825
(car approaching)

424
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,076
(tires screeching)

425
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,160
Names, please?

426
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,288
Lady Penelope Ariel-Ponyweather.

427
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,416
Uh... Rock Strongo.

428
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,750
Your real name?

429
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,294
Uh... Lance Uppercut.

430
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,337
Thank you.

431
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,131
Sign here, Mr. Uppercut.

432
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,717
Let me just put on my glasses.

433
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,851
You're charging how much for a room?

434
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,852
(phone ringing)

435
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,103
Hello?

436
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,356
HOMER (phony voice):
Hello, this is a phone survey.

437
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,859
If the election were held today,

438
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,279
would you vote for A, the cops are there

439
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,032
or B, you're free to talk?

440
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,742
Uh, "A".

441
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,326
And I'd like to add

442
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,663
that Proposition "Hug Lisa for Me"

443
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,206
has my full support.

444
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,125
Oh, Marge, you're not getting it.

445
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,793
It's me, Homer. Simpson.

446
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,919
(chuckles nervously)

447
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,254
We got a location, Chief.

448
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,338
Good work, Lou.

449
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,924
We'll leave right after dinner.

450
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,761
Lisa, this is from your mom.

451
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,262
(grunts)

452
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,346
Ah...

453
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,182
Life on the lam is really hard

454
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,142
but at least it's with you, Dad.

455
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,311
I feel terrible
for putting you through this

456
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,563
after what a wonderful father you've been.

457
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,359
Oh... Lisa, I can't lie to you any longer.

458
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,903
This is all my fault.

459
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,238
I'm the worst dad in the world.

460
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,656
What? Why?

461
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,034
The man who framed you
is a crooked detective.

462
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,118
Who I hired.

463
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,828
Why did you do that?

464
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,455
To find out everything about you

465
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,207
so I'd seem like a good father.

466
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,958
How could you?

467
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,086
Well, all the childless drunks at Moe's

468
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,587
thought it was a great idea.

469
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,631
Let's just get some sleep.

470
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,475
All right, Simpsons, the jig is up!

471
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,810
We know you're in there!

472
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,354
HOMER: OK, I'm coming right out the door.

473
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,522
Damn it!

474
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,398
These windows are
so hard to squeeze through!

475
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,650
(Homer grunts)

476
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,158
Cheer up, honey.

477
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,993
We're living an all-natural existence,

478
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,120
the kind you like.

479
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,663
Ooh, a trash can.

480
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,706
We'll find breakfast in here.

481
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,750
I don't want to eat from the trash.

482
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,252
Ooh, a banana.

483
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,255
What the...?

484
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,757
It's full of cigarette butts.

485
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,967
So is this one.

486
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,593
They must've come from over there.

487
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,928
(circus calliope playing)

488
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,435
Those are the test animals.

489
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,105
The detective must've
sold them to the circus.

490
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,690
We'll just tell the police

491
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,234
and then I'm back to being
plain ol' Rock Strongo.

492
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,278
COLT: You're not telling nobody nothing.

493
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,447
Make one move and you'll get a bellyful

494
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,699
of The Flying Giuseppe.

495
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,242
How you doing?

496
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,578
Dexter Colt.

497
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,538
The man who framed my daughter.

498
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,498
You should've paid the expenses.

499
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,542
In retrospect, yes.

500
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,129
(gasping)

501
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,132
(loud explosion)

502
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,596
(grunting)

503
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,848
Ooh, I think that fixed my back.

504
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,349
(cracking) Oh... oh, no, no.

505
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,475
It's much worse.

506
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,313
(fretful moaning)

507
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,647
I'll just hide here.

508
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,065
(shrieks)

509
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,570
(electrical crackling)

510
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,076
(laughing) Now what are you going to do?

511
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,661
You can't shoot all of us.

512
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,913
-(gunshot)
-Damn it!

513
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,665
You know, Simpson,

514
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,250
from the moment you walked into my office

515
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,376
I had a feeling

516
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,462
I'd kill you in a hall of mirrors.

517
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,172
Dad, are you in here?

518
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,632
How did she find us?

519
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,592
Oh, Lisa has excellent hearing.

520
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,676
Once, when she was three

521
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,678
I was quietly sobbing in the closet,

522
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,138
and she found me.

523
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,141
Oh, Dad, you <i>do </i>remember
something about me.

524
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,601
Perhaps you also remember

525
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,354
this laser Bart gave me earlier.

526
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,396
(screams)

527
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,815
(grunts) I can't see!

528
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,652
How ironic.

529
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,111
Now he's blind

530
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,740
after a life of enjoying
being able to see.

531
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,411
Well, it wasn't easy, honey,

532
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,163
but I'm glad you love me again.

533
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,874
Yeah. But what's
going to happen to the animals?

534
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,167
Don't worry, honey.

535
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,169
I released them all into the wild.

536
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,505
-(monkeys chattering)
-(pigs squealing)

537
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,800
Cletus, if I find pig lipstick
on your collar again

538
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,386
I'm not going to let you
sleep in the sty no more.

539
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,971
Duly noted.

540
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,479
(theme music playing)

541
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,918
BART: Hey, Dad, will you
read me a bedtime story?

542
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,378
HOMER: Why, certainly, Son.

543
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,338
Just hand me that book you've got there.

544
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,424
(computerized voice) <i>Unauthorized user.</i>

545
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,591
<i>-Access denied!</i>
<i>- </i>(electrical zapping)

546
