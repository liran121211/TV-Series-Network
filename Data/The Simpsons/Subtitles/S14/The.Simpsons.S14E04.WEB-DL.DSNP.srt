00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:06,548
CHORUS: <i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:07,590
(tires screeching)

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,177
D'oh! (screams)

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,016
-(knobs squeaking)
-HOMER: Woo-hoo!

6
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:31,031
NARRATOR (on TV): <i>November, 1948.</i>
<i>Americans picked their president.</i>

7
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,867
<i>Victory seemed certain</i>
<i>for Governor Thomas E. Dewey.</i>

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,703
Dewey, Dewey, Dewey.

9
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,955
Dad, I'm telling you, Truman wins.

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,249
NARRATOR: <i>The headlines proclaim:</i>
<i>"Dewey Defeats Truman."</i>

11
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:44,377
Woo-hoo! I win the bet. Who's your daddy?

12
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,880
NARRATOR: <i>But the headlines</i>
<i>are dead wrong.</i>

13
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,048
(gasps)

14
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,633
<i>Harry Truman triumphs by 2 million votes.</i>

15
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,219
Not if I can stop that inauguration.

16
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:57,599
I win, Dad. That means I get to choose
today's father-daughter activity.

17
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,683
Let's hear it.

18
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,602
We're building homes for the homeless.

19
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,978
(gasps)

20
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,065
You know it's gonna be bad,
but you just can't prepare yourself.

21
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,527
"Domiciles for the Destitute"?
Is this that thing Jimmy Carter does?

22
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,781
Yes. But now that it's hip,
all the ex-presidents are doing it.

23
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,657
There's Clinton, Bush Senior,

24
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,744
and the nice guy who finished last,
Jimmy himself.

25
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,872
(humming)

26
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,124
Hey! Why you...

27
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,168
I'm sorry, George. I didn't see you there.

28
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,086
No hard feelings.

29
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,004
I'll slaughter you, you lamebrain.

30
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,422
(groans)

31
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,632
(chuckles)

32
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,675
-What are you laughing at, Clinton?
-Ow.

33
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,011
(grunts)

34
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,222
(grumbles)

35
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,227
(humming)

36
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,812
Dad, what is that?

37
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:47,190
Well, if Bart can be El Barto...

38
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,570
Oh, if only I had your courage, señor.

39
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,072
Ha, ha, thanks. (yelps)

40
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,990
(mutters)

41
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,326
Dad, you're getting paint
on your wedding ring.

42
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,870
Huh? Oh, right. Can you hold it?

43
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,291
This is a Band-Aid wrapped in tinfoil.

44
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,585
My real ring's inside a turtle.

45
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:14,050
-Are you sure we'll find husbands here?
-Absolutely.

46
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,012
These volunteer events are crawling
with the successful single men we deserve.

47
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,181
And how. Let's see what we've got.

48
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,102
NAEGLE: Well, he's not much to look at.

49
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,770
But he is a good father.

50
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:30,066
Hello. Wedding-ring tan line.
He's new on the market.

51
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,651
Hmm.

52
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,404
-Can I help you?
-Maybe. I'm Lindsay Naegle.

53
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,198
And I don't wanna spend
another fiscal year alone. Unh!

54
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:41,161
Cookie Kwan, realtor.
Number one on the west side.

55
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,830
I could move you into
a beautiful new home. Mine.

56
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,416
Sign here, sign here,
kiss me here, initial there.

57
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,375
What the...

58
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,919
ANNOUNCER (on radio): <i>You're listening</i>
<i>to Radio Disney.</i>

59
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,964
<i>The songs you love rewritten for babies.</i>

60
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,799
BAHA MEN (singing) :
♪ <i>Who left the milk out? </i>♪

61
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,551
(singing) <i>♪ Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck ♪</i>

62
00:02:56,634 --> 00:03:00,388
<i>♪ Dad left the milk out</i>
<i>Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck ♪</i>

63
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:04,184
That's good satire.
It doesn't hurt anyone.

64
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,227
What do you think, Maggie?

65
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,729
BAHA MEN: <i>♪ Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck ♪</i>

66
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,272
Oh, look, there's your father!

67
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,065
(grunting)

68
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,275
(gasps)

69
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,236
(ladies exclaiming)

70
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,613
(gasps)

71
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:22,076
Well, I've read enough articles
about flirting to know it when I see it.

72
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,329
(tires screech)

73
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,040
(grunts)

74
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,249
(breathing heavily)

75
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,004
And that's how my beautiful wife
brought our son Bart into the world.

76
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,464
-Aw.
-Touching.

77
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,465
BUSH SENIOR: You knucklehead.

78
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,927
-A little help.
-I'll give you a little help.

79
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,513
(groaning)

80
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:49,395
Uh, Homie, are you as attracted to me
as you were when we met?

81
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,356
Sure, why not?

82
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,734
Sometimes I worry you might think
about other women.

83
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:58,780
Hey, why would I want Purina when I got
Fancy Feast right here?

84
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,324
That doesn't sound very convincing.

85
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,995
Aw. It sounds like all you're looking for
is a little reassurance.

86
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,205
Well...

87
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,540
(snoring)

88
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,294
(squeals)

89
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,633
Bart, remember when I was
crying at recess?

90
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:22,053
I think I'm finally ready to tell you why.

91
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,346
Let's see what's on TV.

92
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:27,100
MAN (on TV): <i>I stick my neck</i>
<i>out for no one, Frankenstein, no one.</i>

93
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,434
(Frankenstein growls)

94
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,728
(Batman theme plays on TV)

95
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,065
Oh, cool, the old <i>Batman </i>show.

96
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,486
Struggling in vain.

97
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,405
Gather your wits, old chum.

98
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:44,575
We seem to have fallen prey
to that painted Pagliacci of perfidy.

99
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,286
You mean, Clownface?

100
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,788
None other.

101
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,623
(laughing maniacally)

102
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,419
Well, if it isn't Bat-mensch
and the Goy Wonder.

103
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,546
(laughing)

104
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:01,009
Sweet Valley High!
Krusty played a Batman villain?

105
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,137
Well, sure. He was also
Uncle Velderschmoink on <i>Bewitched.</i>

106
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,559
Clownface, what in the name of Huntley
and Brinkley do you plan to do to us?

107
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,895
I'm just gonna take you for a spin.

108
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,150
Hoo, Ha, Hee, show our guests
to the twirly gates.

109
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,819
(laughing maniacally)

110
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,829
Holy g-force, Batman.
The blood's rushing to my head.

111
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,789
That's right, my panicky chum.

112
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:37,211
In a few moments, you and I
will literally blush ourselves to death.

113
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,839
KRUSTY: Oh, my,
this is taking a long time.

114
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,216
Oh, cool. We should try that at school.

115
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,387
Hey, yeah. You can try it on me.
Batman got out of it OK.

116
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,433
Faith and begorra, Batman.
How did you ever escape?

117
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:55,146
Fortunately, I always carry
my Carousel Reversal Spray.

118
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,690
Oh, what don't you have in that belt?

119
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,194
Patience for harlequined
hoodlums like yourself.

120
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,988
Truer words were never spoken, crusader.

121
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,535
Manjula, remember when Apu cheated on you?

122
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,620
Yes, thank you.

123
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,456
I'm worried Homer might do the same thing.

124
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,292
What would make a husband
lose interest like that?

125
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,961
What I do now I do as your dearest friend.

126
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,589
Look at this flab. Look at it.

127
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,257
Oh, my God. Is that me?

128
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,884
Most assuredly, yes.

129
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:28,262
Faced with a problem like this,
I wonder, what would Oprah do?

130
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,686
Yes. I need to fit into this
in time for a funeral. Thank you.

131
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,314
Uh, I need some liposuction.

132
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,567
Just enough to make me
attractive to this man.

133
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,529
One 10-minute suck and tuck.

134
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,656
(bell dings)

135
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,536
Doctor, before we begin,
I have a couple questions.

136
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,413
Time is money. Ask the mask.

137
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,791
MARGE: What if I just do aerobics,
hmm...?

138
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,378
(groans)

139
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:05,758
Hmm, that's funny.
Hmm. I don't feel sucked out.

140
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,261
Doctor, my assistant is as flat as ever.

141
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,305
Where are the new knockers
the taxpayers paid for?

142
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,475
Hmm, you're right. That's like flatsville.

143
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,436
Then where did I put those implants?

144
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,895
(screams)

145
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,230
What on earth have you done?

146
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,774
My maguppies became bazongas.

147
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,111
Great Ceausescu's ghost! Are those real?

148
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,446
Oh. Oh, right.

149
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:33,619
Accidentally giving me breast implants
is not a simple misunderstanding.

150
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,580
My surgery was botched.

151
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,249
"Botched." What is that,
the word of the day?

152
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,294
You had no right
to make my bosom this ample.

153
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,715
Look, just come back in 48 hours,
I can remove the implants.

154
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,258
Oh, I'll come back all right.

155
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:50,720
And I'll bring my husband
to do a little malpractice on you.

156
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,890
Yes, your husband. I'm sure he's going
to be furious.

157
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,642
(grunting)

158
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,354
I'm a little worried
about the spinning, Bart.

159
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,899
Milhouse, if you're
uncomfortable with this in any way...

160
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,110
-Do it, Otto. Do it. Do it. Do it.
-You're the boss, kid.

161
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,112
(tires squeal)

162
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,072
(Milhouse screaming)

163
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,659
My change purse!

164
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:18,456
(continues screaming)

165
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,624
Hi, Milhouse.

166
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,545
Skinner, I was a little wary

167
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,549
of bringing these veterans
of Iwo Jima to tour your school,

168
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,844
-but I see my fears were unfounded.
-Thank you, sir.

169
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:36,057
And what more fitting finale
than to gaze reverently at Old Glory?

170
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,769
(all gasping)

171
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,771
Come on, boys. You know the drill.

172
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,192

176
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:58,538
My God! This youngster befouled the flag!

177
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,498
Wait, this just doesn't add up.

178
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,042
Milhouse has never been
anything but a comic foil.

179
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,419
Hey, what's going on here?
Something crazy?

180
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,005
There's your queen bee.
Explain yourself, Simpson.

181
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,091
Uh, I saw Krusty do it on TV.

182
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,677
Then Krusty will feel my wrath.

183
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,262
The spritz has hit the fan.

184
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,515
You won't hurt Krusty, will you?
He's all we got.

185
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,601
-Shut your puke hole, punk.
-Sir. Yes, sir.

186
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,480
(grunts)

187
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,440

192
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,867
Oh, sweetie.

00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,287
(babbles)

194
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,329
Hmm. Oh!

195
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,789
(yelps)

196
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,127
Don't worry, Maggie,

197
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,463
I'll have these silly things out
in just two days.

198
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,174
Till then I'll just try to
hide them from the family.

199
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:58,681
<i>Making it the latest Segway scooter</i>
<i>accident to claim over 1,000 lives.</i>

200
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,476
Not feeling well. Going to bed.
Dinner and breakfast are on the table.

201
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,769
(footsteps receding fast)

202
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,564
Did you label the meals
so I could tell which is which?

203
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,982
MARGE: Yes.

204
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:12,111
<i>Locally, two school children</i>

208
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:24,373
-Would you people get a life?
-Not an option.

209
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,209
-Stop corrupting our children.
-No.

210
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,378
Bart, this is all your fault.

211
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,756
Don't worry. Krusty always
lands on his feet.

215
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,346
(groans)

216
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,768
Well, someone's tucked in
to an insane degree. Good night.

217
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,395
Hey, give me some of those blankets.

218
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,065
-MARGE: Unh!
-HOMER: What's this?

219
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,025
It's enormous.

220
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,902
Oh, my God. There's another one.

221
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,403
Homer, let me explain something.

222
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,238
-HOMER: Explain later.
-Homie.

223
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,823
(Marge giggles)

224
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,451
Ooh, ooh, Homie.

225
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,620
-Hey, what happened?
-HOMER: I fell off.

226
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,331
(both laughing)

227
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,959
Now, don't get too used to these.

228
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,338
That awful doctor said he'd take them out
in a couple of days.

229
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,756
Yeah, he truly is a monster.

230
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,511
Hey, let's go out to dinner tomorrow.
Just you, me, the kids, and the twins.

231
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,929
What do you say?

232
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,515
Hmm. Hmm?

233
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:26,102
Hmm, they do make my neck look thinner.

234
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,270
Oh, all right. Let's do it.

235
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,399
Mom, Lisa pushed me in the laundry basket.

236
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,067
Whatever Bart is saying is a lie.

237
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,276
(gasps)

238
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,362
Mom, what happened?

239
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,322
Your endowment's bigger than Harvard's.

240
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,532
Well, that cinches it.

241
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,785
Lisa gets the prize for the best
off-the-cuff response.

242
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,538
I saw them earlier,
and I was working on it in the hall.

243
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,959
I'm a-sorry, we are a-totally full.

244
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,210
(kids whimper)

245
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,963
Boy, oh, Boyardee.

246
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:58,217
Ha, ha. I bazoom you want
a table. Right this way.

247
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,639
Wow, Mom, your guns got us a great table.

248
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,641
Right by the lobster tank.

249
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,521
For you, pretty lady,
I make a-the fresh a-pasta

250
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,733
instead of the crap a-from a can I give
to a-everybody else.

251
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,527
It's as cold as my love for you.

252
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:21,574
And, Marge, if your mouth get tired,
Angelo here will chew for you.

253
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,868
Yes. I like a-to chew.

254
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,286
Thank you, fellas.

255
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,622
Mom, doesn't it bother you
that they're giving you all this attention

256
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,416
just because of those?

257
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:34,211
That's not true, Lisa. There are a lot of
complicated issues here

258
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,047
that can only be explained through song.

a song like that to me before?

280
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,672
Uh, I was getting around to it.

281
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,052
Kiekie Highsmith, Highsmith Modeling.
Honey, I like your look.

282
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:09,723
Forget it, Kiekie. You're not
putting your brain into her body.

283
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,350
That's not why I'm here.

284
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,727
I can offer your wife
a lot of modeling work.

285
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,188
Trade shows to start. Then, who knows?

286
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,691
No dice. Take your fun
and adventure outside.

287
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,276
-Now, wait, Homer.
-Wait for what?

288
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,652
Confirmation of my attitude?

289
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,405
Homie, I could use
a little more excitement in my life.

291
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,367
Hmm, maybe I'll just keep these.

292
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,536
That's great, Mom, but don't forget--

Gentlemen, say hello to Springfield's
newest supermodel.

304
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,085
You're a lucky man, Homer.

305
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,255
Yeah. This is the longest I've ever gone
without looking at Lenny.

306
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,382
Don't make a fuss over me, boys.

307
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,093
Just pour me a beer in a clean glass.

308
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,346
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you said no fuss.

309
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,350
Uh, I wouldn't eat them peanuts, they're,
uh, spit-backs.

310
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,605
So, Krusty, are you ready
to shoot this apple off my head?

311
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,857
Well, if by "shoot" you mean "teach"

312
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,319
and by "my head" you mean
"safety," then, yes.

313
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:48,322
Oh, man. Now they won't let
Krusty do anything fun.

314
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,033
<i>Teletubbies </i>get away with more than this.

315
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,786
I've learned my lesson, Krusty.

316
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,747
Never again shall I look
directly at an eclipse.

317
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,125
This sucks! Bring out Mr. Teeny!

318
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,462
I can't. They made me
release him into the wild.

319
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,761
(whines)

320
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,347
Hey, we got Krusty into this,
we'll get him out.

321
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,807
We have to make him a hero again.

322
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,519
Maybe if we cut his foot off,
people will feel sorry for him.

323
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,646
It didn't help your dad get your mom back.

324
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,439
(groans)

325
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:27,069
Hi, Mrs. Simpson. My mom said
I'm not to look at you.

326
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,322
-What's with the belt, Mom?
-It's for my back spasms.

327
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,784
If guys didn't keep pinching
my tush, I'd never stand up straight.

328
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,078
I thought you liked all the attention
you were getting.

329
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,248
I'm afraid all that attention is from
the wrong kind of people.

330
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,001
(chuckling)

331
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,092
(sighs)

332
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,761
-Hey, Krusty.
-How'd you get in here?

333
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,181
-The doorman died.
-Oh, no. He was my agent.

334
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,810
Listen. I have a plan that will make
the world fall in love with Krusty again.

335
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,854
It's too late. I've given up.

336
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,982
The Krusty I know didn't get where he is
by giving up.

337
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,027
No, I got where I am
by naming names in the '50s.

338
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,653
OK, what's your plan?

339
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,157
It's simple. We just have to cause a riot
at the Springfield Shoe Expo.

340
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,409
I like. I like.

341
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,869
(car horn honks)

342
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,330
Oh, this is my Woodstock.

343
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,874
(shivering)

344
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:30,132
I have been paid millions to endorse these
butt-ugly shoes.

345
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,425
(crowd chattering)

346
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,928
My forthrightness is my undoing.

347
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:40,225
Kiekie, I'm tired of tradeshow modeling.
My back really hurts.

348
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,438
You seem unhappy. So I'm going to
inject this smile solution into your jaw.

349
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,814
(grunts)

350
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,776
Did you just drug me? What the...?

351
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,987
-Technically, it's a toxin.
-Hmm.

352
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,405
(elephant trumpets)

353
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,865
OK, here's the drill.

354
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,367
A rogue elephant, played
by my old friend Stampy

355
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,703
is about to crush sweet young Milhouse.

356
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,289
Then you run up and save the day

357
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,709
by saying Stampy's safety word, "magumbo."

358
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,711
(Stampy groans)

359
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:12,049
Whoa, he's a big as Brando,
but he takes direction.

360
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,842
Eighty-nine percent of Americans

361
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,470
would rather have a shoehorn
than a computer.

362
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,139
I'd like to 89 you.

363
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,391
I've heard about you vendors.

364
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,311
Hey, lady. I like the way your body looks.

365
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,648
- Stop objectifying my mom.
- I will in a second.

366
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:31,068
Ooh! Hey, baby!
You're an object! Ha-ha-ha!

367
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,445
Help! Help!

368
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,032
Who will save this
promising young honors student?

369
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,869
Hey, hey, hey. I'll save the day.

370
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,164
-Hey, it's that clown who hates children.
-And flags.

371
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:48,502
I say we judge him
by what he does next. Yeehaw!

372
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,921
Hey, elephant, I got one word for you.

373
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:54,133
Columbo! No, that's not it.

374
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:58,095
Modesto! <i>Daktari? </i>Nintendo? Oh.

375
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,766
-(Milhouse groans)
-(Stampy trumpets)

376
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,976
(all gasping)

377
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,687
(Stampy trumpets)

378
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,105
Whoa!

379
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,984
Oh, if he bites, I'm sunk.
If he swallows, I'm good.

380
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,527
(trumpeting)

381
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,904
-Dad, look.
-I'm on it.

382
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,866
Be careful, uh... Uh-oh.

383
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,534
(Homer shouts)

384
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:24,079
All right, aim for the big hose
coming out of his face.

385
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,915
-You mean the trunk?
-Easy there, college boy.

386
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,500
Wait! Wait!

387
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,421
My son, my husband, and the Van Houten boy
are in there.

388
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,799
Sorry, ma'am. We don't negotiate
with elephants.

389
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,427
-Ready...
-Mom, do something.

390
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,096
-...aim...
-I've gotta stop them from shooting.

391
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,639
I don't...

392
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,474
Lisa, don't hate me for this.

393
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,270
Continue aiming. Still aiming.

394
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,940
Hey, cops. Check out this
all-points bulletin.

395
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,735
-(Marge grunts)
-(crowd gasping)

396
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,904
(grunts)

397
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,615
Whoa, look at those magumbos.

398
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,116
(trumpets)

399
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,743
Hey, that's it.

400
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,161
Magumbo!

401
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,412
(groans)

402
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,541
I came out of the elephant's mouth, right?

403
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,251
Because I already showered once today.

404
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,920
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

405
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,346
Well, you saved Krusty's reputation.

406
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,766
And you learned a woman doesn't need
a 48-inch chest to be beautiful.

407
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,559
That's how I felt all along.

408
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,687
(in sing-song) Lisa learned a lesson.
Lisa learned a lesson.

409
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:35,609
Kids, I'd like to re-introduce you
to classic Marge.

410
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,528
I finally feel like me again.

411
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:42,032
-You're not disappointed are you?
-Not at all, sweetie.

412
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,077
At least one of us should be able
to put their arms around the other one.

413
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,662
(Marge groans affectionately)

414
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:50,374
Anyway, you're the only man
I want ogling me.

415
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,543
Oh, we're gonna do
a little more than just ogling.

416
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,795
Oh, Homie.

417
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,546
Let's go get fried chicken.

418
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,425
