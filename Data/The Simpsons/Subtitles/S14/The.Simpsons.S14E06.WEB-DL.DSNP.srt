CHORUS: <i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

2
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,385
D'oh!

3
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:11,469
(screams)

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,971
(tires screeching)

5
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,531
(humming)

6
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,243
Three minutes, forty seconds--

7
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:38,038
a new personal best!

8
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,626
Maggie?

9
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,005
(coughing)

10
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,882
(haughty grunt)

11
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,056
Mmm.

12
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,017
No one will ever know.

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,727
HOMER: Mail call!

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,895
Oh, anything good?

15
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,856
The George Foreman Mail Sorter
will let us know.

16
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,109
(whirring)

17
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,575
(sizzling)

18
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,500
Mmm!

19
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,085
"Your family is invited

20
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,088
to a free weekend
at Stagnant Springs Spa."

21
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,964
Ooh, that place is famous.

22
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,509
It's where J. Lo hit
P. Diddy upside the head

23
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,843
with Gary Coleman.

24
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,893
Our attendants can take
ten years off your face

25
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,436
and stick it in your boobs.

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,272
And this place isn't
just for gals anymore.

27
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,942
It's also for vain, effeminate men.

28
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,070
(squeaking)

29
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,908
Kent Brockman?

30
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,203
Well, if you find this
shocking, look at Tom Brokaw.

31
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,830
(machine whirring)

32
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:02,914
(clicks)

33
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,960
Truly, that was the greatest regeneration.

34
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,962
This place blows.

35
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,046
I'm going to go float a Baby Ruth

36
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,506
down the mineral bath.

37
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,799
Don't worry, kids.

38
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,135
We've got something just for you.

39
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,553
Do you like Dr. Seuss?

40
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,472
-No.
-Then you'll love Dr. Mas-seuss.

41
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,441
Bad posture has floobled
and snozzled your neck.

42
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,611
I'll stop talking like this
if you write me a check.

43
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,737
(slurping)

44
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,990
Ooh...

45
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:40,493
These turtles know
just where the knots are.

46
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,619
It just shows you

47
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,289
God has a plan for every creature.

48
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,207
Yes, yes, indeed.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,959
(cracking)

50
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,294
(sloshing)

51
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,301
(gasps): Ooh! Uh... help, please!

52
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,052
Someone throw me a stick!

53
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,554
Don't struggle.

54
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,222
You'll only sink faster.

55
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,892
Roll your eyes back into your head,

56
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,476
focusing on your breathing.

57
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,645
You should feel a pleasant tingling.

58
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,732
Oh, I do! I do!

59
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,650
(Marge grunting)

60
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,154
Now, get down on all fours
with your rear in the air.

61
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,822
What position is this?

62
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,158
The American taxpayer!

63
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,953
The American taxpayer!

64
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,748
Hmm.

65
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,167
(sighing)

66
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,586
(gasping)

67
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,714
(Homer's inner voice)
<i>Oh, my God, a naked celebrity.</i>

68
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,300
<i>Be cool. Don't stare at his famous wang.</i>

69
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,094
Ha, ha, ha! Go ahead, look.

70
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,013
The whole world already saw it

71
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,890
in <i>Nudist Camp Commandant.</i>

72
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,226
I wore nothing!

73
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,871
"Do not use steam room

74
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,249
if you are overweight
or have a heart condition."

75
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,333
D-ohh!

76
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,544
Wait a minute. I'm not wearing a shirt!

77
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:20,760
(yelling)

78
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,470
(groaning)

79
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,810
(humming)

80
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,105
(grunts)

81
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,774
Who ordered the steamed Gentile?

82
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:38,027
Mm, steamed Gentile.

83
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,362
CHIEF WIGGUM: Don't worry,

84
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,406
us pigs will catch this killer.

85
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,449
Now, Mr. Simpson, is it possible

86
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,077
you're living a double or triple life

87
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,912
that your wife doesn't know about?

88
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,748
Triple? No. Definitely, no.

89
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,459
You have to do something
to protect my husband.

90
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,461
Where on my badge does it say anything

91
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,130
about protecting people?

92
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,381
Uh, second word, Chief.

93
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,009
Thanks, Princeton Pete.

94
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,804
Now, your case requires
someone who understands

95
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,723
the twisted mind of a murderer

96
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,474
and I know just where to find him.

97
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,102
-Paris?
-No. No, not Paris.

98
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,313
(sighs): I'm never going to go to Paris.

99
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,111
These are our most dangerous criminals.

100
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,363
Each one crazier than the last.

101
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,824
Uh, come to think of it he should be there

102
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,118
and this guy-- he should be over there.

103
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,954
Wait. You saying he's crazier than I am?

104
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,874
That's exactly what I'm saying,
Decapitating Harry.

105
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:33,958
Now, move it.

106
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,461
(screaming gibberish)

107
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,421
Yeah. Yeah, whatever.

108
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,799
I don't think this was a great place

109
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,009
to bring the children.

110
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,595
It still beats Disney's
California Adventure.

111
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,679
Mm-hmm.

112
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,556
-Oh, yeah, it's true.
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

113
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,974
So, which one of these psychos

114
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,642
is going to help me catch my killer?

115
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,019
He's right in here.

116
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,397
(beeps)

117
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,982
COMPUTER VOICE: <i>Access denied.</i>

118
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,193
Oh, fine, I got to use a fork.

119
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,449
(door opens)

120
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,035
Hello, Bart.

121
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,287
(screaming) BOTH: Sideshow Bob!

122
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,372
Oh, come now.

123
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,123
We've been through so much together.

124
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,333
Just call me "Bob."

125
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,459
(screaming)

126
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,710
BOTH: Bob!

127
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,216
All right, Bob, if you help us catch

128
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,552
the guy trying to kill Homer,
we'll make it worth your while.

129
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,054
What could you possibly offer me?

130
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,390
Your pick of roles in the prison musical.

131
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,809
This year I think it's <i>Man of La Mancha.</i>

132
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,938
Yeah, Don Quixote,
Sancho Panza, Dr. Carrasco,

133
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,648
you know, they're all great parts.

134
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,858
Ah, what a great show.
I wish it was today.

135
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,235
So what do you say, Bob?

136
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,319
Fair enough.

137
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,322
(groans)

138
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,700
Now, I will need round-the-clock access

139
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,868
to all the Simpsons.

140
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,286
Especially Bart.

141
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,288
Well, then, you might as well
to stay with us.

142
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,874
We serve the same meat the prisons do.

143
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,419
Wait, wait, wait. Bob can't stay with us.

144
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,878
This man has tried to kill me so much

145
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,255
it's not funny anymore.

146
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,589
Don't worry, son.

147
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,300
We have ways of making him compliant.

148
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,844
Dad, I can't believe

149
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,596
you're putting my life at risk
to save your own.

150
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,933
You'll understand someday
when you have kids.

151
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,480
Now, if he even looks at you funny

152
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,066
this shock garter will set him straight.

153
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,318
And don't try taking it off

154
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,446
because it's taped to your leg hair.

155
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,072
And that really hurts.

156
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,115
Oh, come now.

157
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,159
As gentlemen, surely
we can just agree to...

158
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,326
-(shock garter goes off)
-Ack! Gah!

159
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,120
-Sorry.
-Fair enough.

160
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,746
But now that we know what it can do,

161
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,166
there's no need to... Mother! Aah!

162
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,376
Wow, you don't even
have to point it at him.

163
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,461
(buzzing and yelling)

164
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,715
Homer, think carefully.

165
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,383
Of all the people you have known,

166
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,677
who might have reason to do you ill?

167
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,930
Hmm... well, there's Mr. Burns,

168
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:57,268
Fat Tony, the Emperor of Japan,
ex-President Bush.

169
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,769
The late Frank Grimes.

170
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,356
PBS, Stephen Hawking,
the fat little Dixie Chick...

171
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,525
And the state of Florida.

172
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,652
How can one ordinary man
have so many enemies?

173
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,530
I'm a people person... who drinks.

174
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,615
Ah.

175
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,576
Homer, in order
to identify your assailant,

176
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,996
I must follow you through the course
of a normal day.

177
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,664
Just do what you usually do

178
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,083
and the killer will reveal himself.

179
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,168
Gotcha.

180
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,963
This is a normal day?

181
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,508
I just wanted to impress you.

182
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,179
Welcome to your Springfield
Mardi Gras headquarters.

183
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,598
Cast your vote now for this year's king.

184
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,017
HOMER: Ooh, Mardi Gras.

185
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,186
Didn't last year's king have to abdicate

186
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,812
because he married a commoner?

187
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,814
And I'd do it again.

188
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,151
But I do miss the Royal Crown Cola.

189
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,237
Ah, yes, the Kwik-E-Mart.

190
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,696
I haven't been here since I robbed it

191
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,989
dressed as Krusty.

192
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,325
My one successful crime.

193
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,369
You were quite the gentlemen.

194
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,080
Today's robbers,
they are all smash-and-grab.

195
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,790
You understood the dance.

196
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,960
Our time is passing, old friend.

197
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,088
Uh, if you two country hens are
finished clucking,

198
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,924
I'd like to buy a copy of <i>Jugs and Ammo.</i>

199
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,846
Well, we've settled that argument.

200
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,266
You can't read a magazine and drive.

201
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,768
Look, junior, I expect this to be fixed

202
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,812
with quality GM parts!

203
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,398
But your car was built in Croatia.

204
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,400
It's made from old Soviet tanks.

205
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,403
Just fix it, Mr. Sasswrench!

206
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,404
Homer, please.

207
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,573
The last thing you need is more enemies.

208
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,657
Right, right.

209
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,034
I'm counting the pennies in the ashtray.

210
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,203
There's two!

211
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,709
(squeaking)

212
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,835
The trap is set.

213
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,253
The killer will think this dummy

214
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,672
is you out for an evening stroll.

215
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,008
Now we lie in wait

216
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,553
like hungry Cassius for noble Caesar.

217
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,179
You're so smart.

218
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,598
Shock him.

219
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,975
(anguished yell)

220
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,524
(machine squeaking)

221
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,319
Ooh, someone's coming.

222
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,904
Huh, ugh, ugh!

223
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,115
Now who's the sociopath, huh?

224
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,701
Moe!

225
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,787
He's got a dark side
I've never dreamed of.

226
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,456
Well, mystery solved.

227
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,750
Wait a moment...

228
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,420
Oh... he's hurt.

229
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,047
-Go, go, go!
-(tires screeching)

230
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,299
These are Homer's friends and family.

231
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,884
They don't want him dead.

232
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,469
They just want him to suffer.

233
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,012
Aiyaa!

234
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,807
(grunting)

235
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,892
Thank you, Lord.

236
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,270
(grunting)

237
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,857
Once I kill you, everyone
will think I'm the real Homer.

238
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,233
(laughing)

239
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,069
None of this seems odd to you?

240
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,195
Nah.

241
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,913
Say, Bob, how come you were
never able to kill Bart?

242
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,956
Yeah, a kid should be real simple to kill.

243
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,708
I'd just come behind him with a knife

244
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,460
and slit his throat real quick-like.

245
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,170
Guys, Bob is my only hope.

246
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,089
Back off and give him some room to think!

247
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,174
Homer, if I could write haikus

248
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,134
while skinheads beat me with soap,

249
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,428
I can concentrate anywhere.

250
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,310
(gasps)

251
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:34,985
Oh, my God!

252
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,028
He's getting closer!

253
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,698
Ah, my poor jar.

254
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,659
Oh, why didn't I take more photos?

255
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,619
(sighs)

256
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,915
<i>♪ Memories ♪</i>

257
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:52,837
<i>♪ Like the corners of my mind... ♪</i>

258
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,758
Here's an interesting clue.

259
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,845
Homer's assailant left a black smudge
on the spa invitation.

260
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,513
This could be the breakthrough we...

261
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,598
(chuckles)

262
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,016
I thought I could get it

263
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,184
while it was in the recharger.

264
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,145
(screaming)

265
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:14,650
I... what's wrong?... Oh...

266
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,528
I don't know how we ever
had fun without him.

(laugh track playing)

275
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,466
Tom Shales gave this show a good review

276
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,844
and I'm the one in prison!

277
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,306
Uh, Bob, I know you're enjoying
Fall Preview Week,

278
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,349
but I was wondering
if you made any progress

279
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,143
towards finding Homer's killer?

280
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,686
No, I haven't.

281
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,104
Go ahead, shock me.

282
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,231
Well, just a little one.

283
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,025
(babbling)

284
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,321
Homer, it's stuck!

285
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,036
(grunting)

286
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,996
Whew. (gasping)

287
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,585
Listen, Homer, I don't know
who your killer is,

288
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,796
but I do know he'll strike again.

289
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,340
Your only hope is to stay
completely out of sight.

290
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,926
Very well. I am gone!

291
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,761
(grunts)

292
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,474
Don't look at me.

293
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,518
-(knocking)
-MAN: Homer Simpson?

294
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,769
Right here.

295
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,271
-(horns honking)
-(jazz music plays)

296
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,107
You've been elected King of Mardi Gras!

297
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,861
Whoo-hoo! Good things
do happen to bad people.

298
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,279
Honey, the King of Mardi Gras

299
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,698
has to ride around on a float all day.

300
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,325
You'll be a sitting duck.

301
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,035
Marge, you're embarrassing me

302
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,912
in front of the drag queen.

303
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,836
(chuckles)

304
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,004
It's Mardi Gras time in Springfield!

305
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,257
This year's Mardi Gras King is
none other than

306
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,092
local hothead Homer Simpson.

307
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,177
Long live the king!

308
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,303
In a related story,

309
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,764
Homer Simpson may not have long to live.

310
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,599
Homer, it's a trap.

311
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,809
You only won because

312
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,561
somebody stuffed the ballot box...

313
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,728
with these.

314
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,440
Nonetheless, the people have spoken.

315
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,109
But I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

316
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,110
Marge, this is a way

317
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,237
to flush this killer out
once and for all...

318
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,780
and get drunk on a Tuesday.

319
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,033
Today's Tuesday, and you've had six beers.

320
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,910
But I'm not drunk!

321
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,079
(crowd cheering)

322
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,334
The killer is out there.

323
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,796
I would stake my entire fortune
of cigarettes on it.

324
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,715
Now, Bob, I know you're concerned,

325
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,341
but don't worry.

326
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,177
I have operatives working the crowd.

327
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,722
So, uh, you're from Tempe?

328
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,056
I'm from Chicago.

329
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,226
Whoa! I'm so drunk I'm going to puke.

330
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,478
Ever get that feeling, beautiful?

331
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,023
(crowd cheering)

332
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:05,362
America loves its Kings,
from George III to Larry.

333
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,447

(man grunts)

336
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,993
Whew! Just Italians.

337
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,539
His float's already moving.

338
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,708
I didn't even hear the engine start.

339
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,627
Yeah, it's really running quiet.

340
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,921
Some mechanic tuned it up right
before the parade.

341
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,422
A mechanic?

342
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,009
(suspenseful music plays)

343
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,677
(no audio)

344
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,430
(rattling)

345
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,309
(no audio)

346
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,563
My God, that's it!

347
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,651
Homer, you must get off that float!

348
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,402
The brake line has been cut!

349
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,570
(float creaking)

350
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,821
Oh, my God!

351
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,824
Attention drunken idiots,
this is your king!

352
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,827
Sacrifice yourselves to slow me down!

353
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,245
(gulps)

354
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,665
(yells and grunts)

355
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,707
Ooh, that's heavy!

356
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,875
(screams)

357
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,293
(grunts)

358
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,170
Hey, how 'bout some beads?

359
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,922
They're not for dudes!

360
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,131
That's cool.

361
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,804
LISA: Dad's heading straight
for the Museum of Swordfish!

362
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,765
That museum has been nothing
but trouble since it opened.

363
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,518
Must... save... buffoon.

364
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,654
(wheels squeaking)

365
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,616
(screams)

366
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,993
Huh?

367
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,203
Ha, ha! I did it!

368
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,372
Wha-Wha... Huh?

369
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,873
You saved my life!

370
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,837
I've saved a life.

371
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,131
And it feels wonderful.

372
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:50,384
And yet, I could just as easily
drop you to your death.

373
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,844
Don't be so sure.

374
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,722
I've got my legs wrapped
around your ass pretty tight.

375
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,098
(gunshot)

376
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,519
Everything going dark... like Duff Stout

377
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,771
the beer that made Ireland famous!

378
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,064
I love you, Doris!

379
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,108
I... ooh...

380
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,861
Ooh, we're up so high.

381
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,030
Where could that shot have come from?

382
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,950
There's your killer!

383
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,285
Well, duh!

384
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,663
(grunts)

385
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,498
Your king needs these stilts!

386
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,001
Jesus is our only king!

387
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,044
Not anymore.

388
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,462
(grunts)

389
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,588
There he is!

390
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,648
Hey, I know you.

391
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,484
You're my mechanic, Junior.

392
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,986
Frank Grimes Junior!

393
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,822
Frank Grimes?

394
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,908
Don't you remember?

395
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:59,453
Your ape-like incompetence drove
my father insane.

396
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,331
Frank Grimes...

397
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,374
What's this?

398
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,502
"Extremely High Voltage."

399
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,589
Well, I don't need safety gloves because
I'm Homer Simps--

400
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,716
(electricity crackling)

401
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,639
Oh, yeah!

402
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,099
How is Old Grimey?

403
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,017
He's dead!

404
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,393
Like you should be!

405
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,686
Whoa! Whoa!

406
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,730
Wait, Frank Grimes wasn't married.

407
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,148
How could he have a son?

408
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,984
He happened to like hookers, OK?

409
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,695
Dad, I figured it out!

410
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,822
The murderer is--

411
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,406
We know-- Frank Grimes Junior.

412
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,491
Huh?

413
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,952
Precisely.

414
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,996
Take him away, boys.

415
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,002
That's nice work, Bob.

416
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,712
Now give him the rhino tranqs.

417
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,594
(delirious babbling)

418
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,889
If I can tranq out
just one freak on stilts,

419
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,016
I know I've done my job.

420
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,476
You're living the dream, Chief.

421
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,314
Dad, I'm really glad you're still alive.

422
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,608
Yeah, it's every parent's dream

423
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,610
to outlive their children.

424
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,945
Good night, son.

425
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,410
Hello, Bart.

426
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,744
(screams)

427
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,913
(groans)

428
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,332
Looking for this?

429
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,004
Now I'm going to take some advice

430
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,047
that was given to me by Lenny

431
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,008
and kill you without delay.

432
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:44,391
One thrust and the deed is done.

433
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,477
I...

434
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,022
I can't do it.

435
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,565
Huh? Why not?

436
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,859
Well, I guess I've...

437
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,862
Dear God... grown accustomed to your face!

438
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,324

00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,118

We shall meet again, old friend.

462
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,830
But now, I must steal away into the night.

463
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,039
(electrical zapping)

464
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,666
