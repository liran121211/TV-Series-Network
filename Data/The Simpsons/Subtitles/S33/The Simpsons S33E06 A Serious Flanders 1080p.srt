1
00:00:18,838 --> 00:00:22,111
<i>A greedy man
once yearned for more,</i>

2
00:00:22,177 --> 00:00:24,783
<i>so the fool began to borrow.</i>

3
00:00:24,883 --> 00:00:27,354
<i>He ate and drank
and told the bank,</i>

4
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:29,860
<i>"I'll pay the debt tomorrow."</i>

5
00:00:29,927 --> 00:00:33,033
<i>But as both dolt
and purse grew fat,</i>

6
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,337
<i>the calendar grew thinner.</i>

7
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,945
<i>The debt collector had enough</i>

8
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:41,884
<i>and hungered for his dinner.</i>

9
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,969
<i>The coward ran,
with coin in hand,</i>

10
00:00:51,069 --> 00:00:54,408
<i>but come dawn, lost his breath.</i>

11
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:57,582
The fool was caught,

12
00:00:57,649 --> 00:00:59,085
'twas all for naught,

13
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:03,026
for the collector's name
was Death.

14
00:01:03,093 --> 00:01:06,299
Heck of a poem there, fella.

15
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,069
I just caught the tail end.

16
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:11,209
You got any more chilling verses
in that book of yours?

17
00:01:11,309 --> 00:01:14,115
Oh, this isn't
a poetry book, cowboy‐man.

18
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:16,085
This is a ledger of debts.

19
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:19,960
Debts to be paid
in money or blood,

20
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,830
and lately, Venmo.

21
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:24,970
I've been sent
to collect in blood.

22
00:01:26,072 --> 00:01:27,107
Don't do this!

23
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,947
I have a wife
and two young mistresses,

24
00:01:30,013 --> 00:01:31,817
also a secret other wife.

25
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:34,355
Please, I'm a good man.

26
00:01:34,455 --> 00:01:35,692
A good man!

27
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:42,404
In my experience, Mr. Texan...

28
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,647
there's no such thing
as a good man.

29
00:01:50,888 --> 00:01:55,732

30

Mm, as pristine

38
00:02:18,176 --> 00:02:20,047
before Eve came along.

39
00:02:20,147 --> 00:02:21,182
Homer Simpson?

40
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,549
I didn't know you were a fellow
volunteer Litter Gitter?

41
00:02:23,587 --> 00:02:24,799
No, I'm doing community service

42
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:28,263
'cause of where I told the judge
to shove some parking tickets.

43
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,167
Well, sir,
I guess your punishment

44
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:32,739
is my predilection to do good.

45
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:35,945
Oh, Flanders, you do
so much for the town,

46
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:38,283
yet no one ever
appreciates you for it.

47
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,418
Why, thank you, Homer.

48
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:42,424
Not a compliment.
Saying you're dumb.

49
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:48,804
Shucks!

50
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:50,608
Gosh! Ah!

51
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:52,378
Honey, ooh, mustard!

52
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:02,899
Hey, that's a strange place
to check your bag‐a‐rino.

53
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:07,441
Dear Lord.

54
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:09,145
Crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap,

55
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:11,082
crap! Oof!

56
00:03:11,182 --> 00:03:13,286
I saw you fell,

57
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:16,092
so I rushed over
to laugh at you, then...

58
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:25,110
Aw, it's always been my dream
to find a bag of money.

59
00:03:25,177 --> 00:03:26,479
You stole my dream.

60
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,751
You know, I'd say it's all
a part of God's plan,

61
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:31,557
but usually that only applies
to horrible tragedies.

62
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,529
Aw, a do‐gooder like you
finding this money

63
00:03:34,596 --> 00:03:37,569
is proof that karma is real,
which sucks

64
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:40,040
'cause now I can't club you
over the head and take it.

65
00:03:40,107 --> 00:03:42,277
Aw, thanks, neighbor.

66
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:47,789
$173,296.

67
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:52,297
We should get a huge terrarium
with like a million turtles.

68
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:55,872
No, we should get a speedboat
with bunk beds on it.

69
00:03:55,972 --> 00:03:57,141
‐Turtles. 
‐Bunk‐boat.

70
00:03:57,207 --> 00:03:58,978
‐Turtles! 
‐Bunk‐boat!

71
00:03:59,044 --> 00:04:00,681
I wish your great‐grandfather,

72
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,019
Paw Paw Flanders,
was still here to guide us.

73
00:04:03,086 --> 00:04:05,658
He was the finest man
I ever knew.

74
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:10,400
Pouch of chewing tobacco
for myself

75
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,039
and a pouch of candy tobacco
for my grandson.

76
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:18,617
Paw Paw, that man stole
a loaf of bread.

77
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:21,022
It's under his T‐shirt
that says...

78
00:04:21,155 --> 00:04:23,193
Linda Ronstadt.

79
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:24,863
Stay here, Neddy.

80
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:29,639
Afternoon, mop top.

81
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:31,142
Yeah?

82
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,187
Here's some "bread"
for your bread,

83
00:04:37,254 --> 00:04:39,458
my countercultural friend.

84
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,701
‐Have a good one.
‐Death to pigs, except you, man.

85
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:46,540
Gee, Paw Paw,
why didn't you arrest him?

86
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:49,245
Neddy, when I was growing up
at the orphanage,

87
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:51,382
the nuns taught us one thing:

88
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:54,021
the harder the good,
the better the man.

89
00:04:55,992 --> 00:04:58,631
Boys, I know just what to do.

90
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,373
Oh, my gosh.

91
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,112
In all my years
of orphanagereal management,

92
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:09,451
I've never seen
a donation this generous.

93
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,690
The town's gonna go
ape over bananas

94
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,395
when it hears all about
your generosity.

95
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:16,065
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

96
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:18,136
I always donate anonymously.

97
00:05:18,203 --> 00:05:20,541
"When thou doest thine alms..."

98
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:24,014
"Do not sound a trumpet
before thee."

99
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:25,651
Matthew 6:2.

100
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:29,726
Aw, but wouldn't you like
some accolades

101
00:05:29,826 --> 00:05:32,699
and attaboys for being
such an upstanding fella?

102
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,803
Oh, I don't do good deeds
for recognition.

103
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,673
That's why no one
ever gives it to me.

104
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:37,976
Hold on.

105
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:42,719
What if you donated that money
in the name of someone special?

106
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:46,325
I could honor my Paw Paw.

107
00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:49,331
Oh, see?
Nothing prideful about that.

108
00:05:49,431 --> 00:05:51,837
Now, what's the name
of the saintly fella

109
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:54,241
you'd like to give
all the credit to?

110
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:55,912
Ned Flanders.

111
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:57,214
Uh, the First.

112
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:00,888
Ned's number one!

113
00:06:00,955 --> 00:06:03,192
Paw Paw was technically
Ned number one,

114
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:04,829
so that chant's okay with me.

115
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:08,871
So, how does it feel to be the
most beloved man in Springfield?

116
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:10,908
You mean, the grandson of?

117
00:06:12,044 --> 00:06:14,816
It feels darn‐diddly good.

118
00:06:28,544 --> 00:06:30,080
I love a pomegranate.

119
00:06:30,146 --> 00:06:34,188
Its juices remind me of the
bloody profession I've chosen.

120
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:36,860
No, I agree, it's not subtle.

121
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:40,166
Anyhoo, the Rich Texan account
has been balanced,

122
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,371
and I'll be bringing you
the proof.

123
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:44,809
No, not the whole head.

124
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:47,782
They only let you have
one bag on United.

125
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:51,222
<i>An anonymous do‐gooder donated
a fortune to a local orphanage,</i>

126
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:53,961
<i>money found
in an old Pan Am bag.</i>

127
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:58,537
<i>A grand total of $173,296.</i>

128
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:01,108
I'm staying in Springfield.

129
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:05,785
I have a very old,
very personal debt to collect.

130
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:09,224
<i>I spoke to the generous donor,
who insisted on anonymity.</i>

131
00:07:09,258 --> 00:07:11,863
<i>It feels darn‐diddly good.</i>

132
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:21,817
Good day to you, shopkeep.

133
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:24,121
Quite the collection
of funny books you have here.

134
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:25,457
Wonder if you could help us.

135
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:28,831
Looking for a local fella,
name of Flanders.

136
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:32,237
Do I look like the town's
information kiosk to you?

137
00:07:32,304 --> 00:07:33,741
It is much smaller than I.

138
00:07:33,774 --> 00:07:35,678
Hit the bricks, Lucky Charms.

139
00:07:35,711 --> 00:07:38,349
I like a good joke.

140
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,451
But my partner?

141
00:07:39,552 --> 00:07:41,590
She's not quite as jovial.

142
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:44,562
- ‐Now, where's this Flanders chap?
- ‐

143
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:48,036
Ooh, locking the door
as a means of intimidation.

144
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:49,639
How original.

145
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:52,679
The silent
but violent accomplice,

146
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:55,016
another overworked cliché.

147
00:07:58,691 --> 00:08:00,460
Correction, French accomplice.

148
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:03,232
An unexpected yet still
underwhelming twist.

149
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:04,435
Two stars.

150
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:06,640
Just point us towards
Ned Flanders,

151
00:08:06,707 --> 00:08:08,276
and Colette won't have to spoil

152
00:08:08,343 --> 00:08:11,048
this lovely morning
we're having.

153
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,490
Mando!

154
00:08:16,526 --> 00:08:18,864
Stop, stop! I don't know
where Flanders lives,

155
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:22,371
but you can always find him at
the First Church of Springfield.

156
00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:25,210
Now, that wasn't
so hard, was it?

157
00:08:25,276 --> 00:08:28,149
I'll let you get back to your
Heathcliffs and your Garfields.

158
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,986
I only like the cat ones.

159
00:08:32,224 --> 00:08:36,265
Um, two thugs just manhandled me
in the collectibles.

160
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:39,906
<i>Why the hell am I
paying you for protection?</i>

161
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:42,745
If another outfit
is moving in on my town,

162
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:46,520
then appropriate violence
will be taken.

163
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:52,732
Bye, now.

164
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,769
Mr. Flanders, it's an honor

165
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:57,575
to live next door
to such a generous man.

166
00:08:57,642 --> 00:08:58,711
Baller move, Ned.

167
00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:00,581
You splashed the cash
on some no‐dads,

168
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:03,554
and now you're the top
God‐wad. Respect.

169
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,891
Well, I can't accept
your praise,

170
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,795
as that donation
wasn't in my name.

171
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:11,202
Oh, you heard him, kids.
Take back your praise.

172
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:12,805
Anonymous Boy Scout Superman

173
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:15,243
doesn't want any hugs
or handshakes

174
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:17,314
or little pats on the head.

175
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,153
Well, I wasn't trying to‐‐

176
00:09:20,253 --> 00:09:21,288
Um, oops.

177
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:24,061
I forgot my Bible inside. Bye.

178
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,769
Uh, pardon me, sir.

179
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:30,173
I believe that's my good book
you're giving a look.

180
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,843
"Ned Flanders."

181
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:33,379
Used to be a man had to die

182
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:35,885
to get his name
printed in his Bible.

183
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,955
Eh, guess I saved someone
the trouble.

184
00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:40,093
Hey, haven't seen you
in our church before.

185
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,462
Are you new to the pew?

186
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,332
I am a debt collector by trade,

187
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,573
and this ledger
is my "good book."

188
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,779
I only have one unbalanced debt,
my very first.

189
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:52,752
It's like having a tickle
in my nose for 50 years

190
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:56,158
but never getting to sneeze.

191
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:00,233
That's the same amount I‐‐

192
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,206
This is now your debt to me.

193
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:06,546
Uncle Neddy!

194
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,951
Barb, am I glad to see you.

195
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:10,621
You know, I was just
talking to...

196
00:10:10,688 --> 00:10:12,390
He's gone.

197
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:13,827
No, I'm not.

198
00:10:13,894 --> 00:10:17,134
I started to hide, but I
couldn't find any good places.

199
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,608
I'll see you later.

200
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,814
That was the most terrifying
man I ever met.

201
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,618
Yup, he's an odd duck,
all right.

202
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:27,387
Say, I'm glad I found you.

203
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:30,326
The Springfield Winter Markets
are opening tonight,

204
00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:34,067
and I was pondering if you
wanted to come with.

205
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,370
To chaperone the kids?

206
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:37,407
To chaperone me.

207
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,178
Like a date.

208
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:41,817
Ooh!

209
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,870
Get out of town.
You? A javelin thrower?

210
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:53,874
Oh, yeah. I would've qualified

211
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:55,778
for the Pine City
Junior Throwlympics, but,

212
00:10:55,878 --> 00:10:57,323
you know, that was
the year the good Lord

213
00:10:57,347 --> 00:11:00,053
thought to bless me
with my top shelf here.

214
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:02,157
I hated to hang up
my javelin clogs,

215
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,196
but luckily I discovered
my true passion:

216
00:11:05,263 --> 00:11:06,733
parentless children.

217
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,639
Barb Belfry, at the risk
of sounding crass,

218
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:11,710
I... I think you're swell.

219
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:13,580
Cute couple alert.

220
00:11:13,614 --> 00:11:15,818
So cute, so cute!

221
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:18,590
Some arm candy for Flandy.

222
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:20,226
Whoop‐de‐do.

223
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:24,368
Uh, you've had
a little too much eggnog.

224
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,940
Nog just gives voice to truth.

225
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,046
That's right, neighborino.

226
00:11:30,113 --> 00:11:31,181
I'm onto you.

227
00:11:31,282 --> 00:11:33,754
When you bought
all the orphans in town,

228
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,925
I thought you were a fool,

229
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,964
but now I see what you
really did with that money:

230
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:43,172
buy the love and admiration
of all these suckers.

231
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:44,408
Boo!

232
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:47,648
All right, noggy,
into the drunk rink with you.

233
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,353
Go slip it off.

234
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:59,371
I've never been so humiliated
at a seasonal market.

235
00:11:59,438 --> 00:12:03,246
How can someone else's
generosity make you angry?

236
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:05,918
Mm, because that money
should've been mine!

237
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:08,089
I fall down inclines
all the time,

238
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:12,632
and all I ever get
is concussionezzezzezzezzes...

239
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,734
zzezzes.

240
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,838
Wow. I can't believe I'm married

241
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:18,577
to the most selfish man
in the world.

242
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,636
How come every song you play

243
00:12:31,703 --> 00:12:33,974
has to be so kooky and obscure?

244
00:12:34,107 --> 00:12:36,546
Just for once, I wouldn't mind
a little Taylor Swift

245
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:38,015
before we commit an atrocity.

246
00:12:40,186 --> 00:12:41,556
It's right here.

247
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:45,631
Relax. I remember it.

248
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,267
Evergreen Terrace.

249
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,237
740... something.

250
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:01,563
Hmm?

251
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,215
What do you got there, boy?

252
00:13:11,315 --> 00:13:13,219
Drop it, boy. Drop it.

253
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:21,368
Doggy man face.

254
00:13:26,445 --> 00:13:28,082
Nighty night, Mr. Flanders.

255
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:37,334
Well, as the picture frame
said to the level,

256
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:39,739
that was quite an even‐ing.

257
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:45,350
Oh, this was
the best night I've had

258
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,886
in a month of Sundays.

259
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:48,824
Barb, if I were
to kiss you right now,

260
00:13:48,857 --> 00:13:50,794
would, uh, would that
be all right?

261
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:52,631
Golly, it sure would.

262
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,802
Hot dog!

263
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:56,238
Well, bye.

264
00:13:56,305 --> 00:14:00,413
Ned, would you like to come in
and see my javelin medals?

265
00:14:00,514 --> 00:14:03,486
‐Oh, yeah. Oh, you betcha.
‐ Diddly.

266
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:05,089
‐That's the business. 
‐Doodly.

267
00:14:05,156 --> 00:14:07,293
‐Oh, good golly, Miss Molly.
‐Great golly.

268
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:10,601
Right in the kisser. 
Oh, yeah.

269
00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:14,675
Is that... is that Sideshow Mel?

270
00:14:14,776 --> 00:14:16,145
You must be a real fan.

271
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:18,550
Well, I used to be.

272
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:26,298
He's your husband?

273
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,104
Well, technically,
but don't you worry, hon.

274
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:31,375
We got an arrangement,
me and Mel.

275
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:32,545
What?!

276
00:14:32,645 --> 00:14:34,982
I get to have
my extracurriculars

277
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:36,385
and, uh, so does he.

278
00:14:36,452 --> 00:14:39,091
Well, he tries, anyway.
Aw, bless his heart.

279
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:41,830
Oh, Lordy, I'm an adulterer.

280
00:14:41,896 --> 00:14:45,403
Don't mind me.
Just rebooting the Wi‐Fi.

281
00:14:45,504 --> 00:14:46,973
Gah, the cuckold!

282
00:14:47,073 --> 00:14:49,912
Oh, come on, Mel. You knew
I had the living room tonight.

283
00:14:49,979 --> 00:14:51,683
Check the darn schedule.

284
00:14:51,783 --> 00:14:52,918
Don't worry about him.

285
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:54,856
He can turn his video game
up real loud.

286
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:57,260
Barb Belfry,
this diddly‐daliance

287
00:14:57,327 --> 00:14:59,397
is doodily.
done.

288
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:03,940
Another Craigslist winner?

289
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:05,711
Oh, shut up, Mel.

290
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,453
Your prized piggy,

291
00:15:10,554 --> 00:15:12,892
Mr. Ned Flanders.

292
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:17,935
This is not Ned Flanders.

293
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:19,705
W‐Well, sure it is.

294
00:15:19,806 --> 00:15:21,442
Why, look at his credit cards,

295
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:23,078
his medic alert bracelet,

296
00:15:23,145 --> 00:15:25,450
the tag on his suspiciously
tight undershirt.

297
00:15:25,517 --> 00:15:28,122
They‐they all say Ned Flanders.

298
00:15:28,222 --> 00:15:31,395
Stupid Flanders,
getting me kidnapped.

299
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:37,273
You've brought me the wrong man!

300
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,146
Okay, okay,
I'll just get rid of him.

301
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:43,185
Don't kill him.

302
00:15:43,252 --> 00:15:44,020
Yet.

303
00:15:44,087 --> 00:15:45,557
It's your lucky day, big boy.

304
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:47,895
I hope you like HGTV.

305
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:50,701
This one loves
the <i>Property Brothers.</i>

306
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:53,472
Giant charmless goons.

307
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,613
Oh, Lord, seems like
everything's gone screwy

308
00:15:56,646 --> 00:15:58,884
ever since I donated
that money in my name‐‐

309
00:15:58,984 --> 00:16:02,190
I mean, in, uh, Paw Paw's name.

310
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,864
Oh, are you punishing me
for one small,

311
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,035
possibly prideful moment?

312
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:11,609
God?

313
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:13,947
Not quite, church chum,

314
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,886
but another friend of yours
is on the line.

315
00:16:16,953 --> 00:16:18,122
Flanders, you got to save me.

316
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:20,226
This guy's way too weird
not to be dangerous.

317
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:22,565
He doesn't even look
at his phone when he's bored.

318
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:23,834
He's not human, I tell you.

319
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,471
You've got 24 hours
to get me my money,

320
00:16:26,573 --> 00:16:29,879
or I'll take out his tonsils
with a power drill.

321
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:31,014
No cops.

322
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,122
Ned, Homer's missing.

323
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:38,195
I just found the back door open,
his car's in the garage,

324
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:41,769
and the dog looks really queasy
for some reason.

325
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:46,278
The last thing I said to Homer

326
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:49,184
was that he was the
most selfish man in the world.

327
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:50,921
Do you think
I should call the police?

328
00:16:50,988 --> 00:16:53,325
<i>Oh, no. If she calls the police,
Homer's dead.</i>

329
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:56,933
<i>If I want to save his life,
I have to... tell a lie.</i>

330
00:16:57,033 --> 00:17:00,239
Uh, H‐Homer, uh, uh,
stopped by here last night

331
00:17:00,306 --> 00:17:02,912
and apologized
for being a jerk to me,

332
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:05,116
and‐and, uh, you know,
then he hopped on a bus

333
00:17:05,182 --> 00:17:07,387
to Shelbyville
for a‐a‐a three‐day

334
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:09,692
anger management course
at the Airport, uh,

335
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,061
Hyatt‐Hyatt Express.

336
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:13,065
That doesn't sound like Homer.

337
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,401
Are you calling me a liar?!

338
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:17,975
No, but if anyone other than you
told me that story,

339
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:20,079
I'd be a little suspicious.

340
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:22,618
Oh, you got to believe
old Honest Ned.

341
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:25,958
Anyway, I'm, uh, late for my,
uh... hormone therapy.

342
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:28,162
Bye, now. No cops.

343
00:17:28,229 --> 00:17:31,769
Something about this
just doesn't feel right.

344
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:54,548
Ah, donut and a fried egg.

345
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:58,222
You, stranger, are a man
of circular tastes.

346
00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:03,499
On the subject of circles,
some associates of yours

347
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:07,641
roughed up a rotund gentleman
under my protection,

348
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,212
and now I am irate.

349
00:18:10,346 --> 00:18:12,016
Hmm.

350
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:16,358
Did you ever hear the parable
of Lucifer and the millipede?

351
00:18:16,425 --> 00:18:18,295
One day, a tiny millipede...

352
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:21,536
Get the hell out of my town,
or else!

353
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,758
Excuse me.
Have you seen this man?

354
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:34,427
Sure, that's the hobo

355
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:36,465
that eats the day,
olds out of our dumpster.

356
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:39,270
Haven't seen him today, though.

357
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:44,214
You just ate
your last cigar, old man.

358
00:18:45,617 --> 00:18:47,053
Ah, coffee.

359
00:18:47,153 --> 00:18:49,024
Exactly how I like it,

360
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,794
scalding hot!

361
00:18:50,894 --> 00:18:52,898
Ah! But you said hot.

362
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,334
Hot!

363
00:18:59,177 --> 00:19:00,747
Gun!

364
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:02,317
What the...

365
00:19:05,122 --> 00:19:06,993
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

366
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,932
Stayin'

367
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,775
You should've let me
finish my parable!

368
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,581
Ahoy‐hoy.

369
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:30,206
Huh?

370
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:32,043
Uh...

371
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:37,353
Why are you dipping
my face in dough?

372
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,992
Why are you kneading my face
into an "O" shape?

373
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:43,298
Why are you pushing my face
toward the deep fryer?

374
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:46,104
Oh, I see. Clever.

375
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,419
Madam.

376
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:01,101
Homer.

377
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,005
Oh, no.

378
00:20:03,072 --> 00:20:06,144
Hands up. This is totally...

379
00:20:06,211 --> 00:20:08,082
Oh, God! My God!

380
00:20:08,182 --> 00:20:09,518
What the hell happened?!

381
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:12,591
Oh, Mafia guys! Headless dude!

382
00:20:12,658 --> 00:20:14,695
Oh, Disco Man!

383
00:20:14,795 --> 00:20:16,431
I need some water.

384
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:19,705
Oh! His face is a donut!

385
00:20:19,772 --> 00:20:22,009
That is so messed‐up.
