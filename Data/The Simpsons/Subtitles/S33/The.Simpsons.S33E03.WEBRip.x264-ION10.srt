Barti, wait for me.

9
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:42,786
Shh!
Stop all that noise.

10
00:00:42,852 --> 00:00:44,790
A hunter has entered the forest.

11
00:00:44,856 --> 00:00:47,061
Cool.
What's a hunter?

12
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:55,444
- Run, Barti, run!
- Not without you, Mama.

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,285
Owl season starts next week.
Next week!

14
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:01,189
‐ ‐Death.

15
00:01:01,255 --> 00:01:04,328
Barti, if you love me, run!

16
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:10,340
I made it, Mama.

17
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:13,380
Mama?

18
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:14,883
Mama?!

19
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,462
Where‐where's my mama?

20
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,037
I'm fine, sweetheart.
I'm fine.

21
00:01:25,103 --> 00:01:28,043
Your father took care of
the bad man.

22
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:30,347
Time for a little "stag party."

23
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,792
- Thank God you're herbivores.
- That's right.

24
00:01:35,858 --> 00:01:38,764
And today your name is "Herb."

25
00:02:02,144 --> 00:02:03,848
This family is so poor.

26
00:02:03,914 --> 00:02:07,287
I hate to say it,
but you are a bad provider.

27
00:02:07,354 --> 00:02:09,726
Hey, I put
a roof over your head.

28
00:02:11,028 --> 00:02:12,532
Okay, under your head.

29
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,770
Family, I have excellent news.

30
00:02:14,836 --> 00:02:17,407
I got a job as a tutor
in a nice, rich home.

31
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:19,546
How deep is the water
in their living room?

32
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:21,449
There's no water
in their living room.

33
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:24,221
That's a thing?

34
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:29,866
Oh, Homie, use a coaster.

35
00:02:38,517 --> 00:02:40,020
Okay, here's a math problem.

36
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:41,757
How long can the two of us

37
00:02:41,824 --> 00:02:46,165
watch your hundred‐inch TV
before anyone gets wise?

38
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,336
"Y" equals 102.

39
00:02:48,403 --> 00:02:50,340
What the hell
are you talking about?

40
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:52,211
I want to watch TV.

41
00:02:57,287 --> 00:02:58,557
Tickets.

42
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:07,140
Oh, blood and guts.

43
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:09,679
Sir, you're not happy
with me? Why?

44
00:03:09,746 --> 00:03:12,585
You have the poor person smell.

45
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:15,858
Gas station ramen,
a whiff of despair.

46
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:19,465
May I?
Oh, also class resentment.

47
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,935
Almost boiling over.

48
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:22,739
- Very dangerous.
- Mm‐hmm.

49
00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:25,076
Now leave. I just have
to find another idiot

50
00:03:25,143 --> 00:03:26,145
to take your job.

51
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:27,649
Idiot, eh?

52
00:03:27,715 --> 00:03:29,920
How did you
hear about this position?

53
00:03:29,986 --> 00:03:32,357
Well, through proper channels.

54
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:33,704
Certainly not through
your tutor,

55
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:35,063
who I never met,

56
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,100
Or your new maid, Marge.
Or your‐‐

57
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:38,671
Lisa, what's your job again?

58
00:03:38,737 --> 00:03:41,677
Uh, sir, I'm the art teacher.

59
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:45,584
Aw, you've loved art ever
since you were a little...

60
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:47,989
late for the job interview.

61
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:49,124
<i>Ja, ja. Gut.</i>

62
00:03:49,191 --> 00:03:50,403
We are leaving
on a long vacation.

63
00:03:50,427 --> 00:03:53,634
Here are the keys to the beer
garden, the saxophone room,

64
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,638
and my armory of stink bombs.

65
00:03:55,705 --> 00:03:58,009
- Can we trust you?
- Honored sir,

66
00:03:58,076 --> 00:03:59,679
we are beyond reproach.

67
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:01,817
Especially the new groundskeeper.

68
00:04:05,256 --> 00:04:06,593
Ah.

69
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:10,066
I think she has
a thing for the pool boy.

70
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:19,753
Stupid rich people.

71
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:22,525
While they're gone, we eat
their food, drink their booze,

72
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:24,729
and break
their complicated toilets.

73
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:27,802
I was not built
for the American ass.

74
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:30,941
He thinks
I am a drinking fountain. Ugh.

75
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:36,520
Who could that be?
At this hour?

76
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:39,391
In the pouring rain?

77
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:43,266
<i>Please let me in.
My jeans are wet.</i>

78
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:45,905
<i>And they're
my only pair of pants.</i>

79
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:48,209
Oh, you poor, poor man.

80
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:50,447
Can I get you some tea?

81
00:04:50,514 --> 00:04:53,419
Oh, yeah, I‐I know where it is.

82
00:04:57,962 --> 00:04:59,833
Sir, what are you doing?

83
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:04,108
I need to go...
downstairs.

84
00:05:05,443 --> 00:05:07,515
Daddy's coming!

85
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:18,770
Go on... without me.

86
00:05:18,837 --> 00:05:19,772
Really, fatso?

87
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,410
You're that exhausted
going <i>downstairs?</i>

88
00:05:22,477 --> 00:05:24,248
Why, you little...

89
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:30,861
Huh?

90
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,702
That's right, I hid my family

91
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:38,109
in this cramped,
windowless basement.

92
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:40,581
This is nicer than our house.

93
00:05:40,648 --> 00:05:43,587
See what I mean?
Bad provider.

94
00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:45,390
Everything was great

95
00:05:45,456 --> 00:05:48,062
until you parasites
took our jobs.

96
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:51,870
You're squatting in the basement
and you're calling <i>us</i> parasites?

97
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:55,744
Well, maybe the truth is
the master is the parasite

98
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:59,819
because he exploits us all,
and, um, yeah, okay.

99
00:05:59,886 --> 00:06:01,464
This is where you're supposed
to be smacking them

100
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:04,562
- with the frying pan.
- Sorry.

101
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,344
- Parasites.
- Parasites!

102
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,582
Geez, how many people
live down here?

103
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:16,553
People of all incomes.

104
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,422
This house is an allegory.

105
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:20,794
Emphasis on "gory."

106
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:25,236
You don't have
a worthwhile bone in your body.

107
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:35,490
Wait! If we all work together,
regardless of class,

108
00:06:35,557 --> 00:06:38,429
we could finally change
everything for the better.

109
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:41,870
Wow, that sounds great.
Unless it's socialism.

110
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:44,174
Not totally,
but certain aspects are

111
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:46,445
- similar to social...
- Kill her!

112
00:06:53,627 --> 00:06:56,766
Seeing all that horror
and poverty makes me think

113
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,239
- we should lower the corporate
tax rate even further. - Agreed.

114
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:03,309
There's no way they
can get up here, is there?

115
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,686
Heh, heh, heh.

116
00:07:07,988 --> 00:07:09,291
My last words are

117
00:07:09,358 --> 00:07:11,362
"I'm too young
and beautiful to die.

118
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:13,032
Take a baby instead."

119
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:24,922
Well, Marge, I finally
got you a house with no leaks.

120
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:27,928
Yeah, but it's filled
with dead bodies.

121
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:31,001
Some people are never happy.

122
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:43,994
And they say on moonless nights,

123
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,463
just like this one,

124
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,004
in ordinary neighborhoods,
just like this one,

125
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,874
the ghost of
the murdered squirrel

126
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:53,212
leaps, treehouse to treehouse,

127
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,185
biting the toes of little girls.

128
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:02,932
You sure scared them.

129
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:06,171
- Can you get off my lap?
- In due time.

130
00:08:06,238 --> 00:08:08,375
Oh, Marge.

131
00:08:08,442 --> 00:08:10,981
I did a chore today.

132
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:12,518
Which one?

133
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:16,926
Unloaded the dishwasher.
All... the... way.

134
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:18,062
Ooh.

135
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:24,107
Mom, Dad,
can we sleep in your bed?

136
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:29,150
Oh, which scary story did
Bart tell you this time?

137
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,923
The one where the little girl's
head is filled with potato bugs,

138
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,425
and there's no way she can tell?

139
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:35,463
'Cause that's
only partially true.

140
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:38,068
No! And that's even worse!

141
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:41,709
Lousy treehouse.

142
00:08:41,776 --> 00:08:43,980
Every year,

143
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:46,318
two of them good,
and a lame one in the middle.

144
00:08:46,385 --> 00:08:47,588
I'll put an end to that.

145
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:55,202
Stupid hard work.
I'll put an end to that.

146
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:11,101
Who dares cleave my trunk,
because...

147
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:12,203
You keep talkin'.

148
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,439
I'm gonna chop you down

149
00:09:13,506 --> 00:09:15,309
before you finish that sentence.

150
00:09:33,713 --> 00:09:35,349
<i>I am Groot.</i>

151
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:38,489
Hmm. You're real mature.

152
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:40,326
Laughin' at
a brain‐damaged tree.

153
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:48,910
Help! Help! S‐O‐S!

154
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:50,781
Is there a dendrologist
in the house?

155
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,387
And this is
the Doppler Effect...

156
00:09:54,454 --> 00:09:56,893
Always teaching science...

157
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,669
Oh, ain't that nice?
A tree farm.

158
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:05,977
No!

159
00:10:06,044 --> 00:10:08,482
This holiday is worse
than Dutch Elm Disease.

160
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,152
Eh, no offense there.

161
00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:20,774
Oh, yeah...

162
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,919
Humans have abused us
for too long.

163
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:30,259
Today we celebrate
our Arbor Day.

164
00:10:30,326 --> 00:10:34,134
We have got to get
a better name for that holiday.

165
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:49,197
I may live in the human world,

166
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:51,368
but I never forget
my tree roots.

167
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:55,476
Hey! How'd you like me
to pick something off you?

168
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:59,050
I didn't like it at all.

169
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:02,023
Feed me. Feed me!

170
00:11:03,593 --> 00:11:05,664
You're not a tree.
You're a plant.

171
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,202
Yes, but I identify as a tree.

172
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,139
I'm a trans‐plant.

173
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:14,949
A legion of forest grumps
is heading into town,

174
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:19,758
bent on revenge for years of
bad tree‐tment.

175
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:23,265
This just in, my chest...

176
00:11:33,385 --> 00:11:35,991
All right, this is it.
No tree is a match for

177
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:37,260
a human with a wooden bat.

178
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:41,134
First, we kill them,
then we hang our hammocks!

179
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,403
(cheering

180
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:46,913
Finally I'll get my revenge

181
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:49,551
for all the leaves I had
to rake, and all the prunin'.

182
00:11:49,618 --> 00:11:52,724
And the times a tree leaped
out in front of me tractor

183
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,695
when I was textin' me friends.

184
00:11:54,762 --> 00:11:57,033
Gah!

185
00:12:01,274 --> 00:12:03,211
Oh, no. Pollen!

186
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:05,583
And I'm all
out of antihistamine.

187
00:12:09,558 --> 00:12:10,392
Huh?

188
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:12,564
Time to hit me a homer.

189
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:29,297
Whee!

190
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:34,842
Oh, the trees won.

191
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:38,181
Another crass play for
an environmental award.

192
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:42,189
You will make
a fine beanbag chair.

193
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:44,394
That is very difficult
to dispute.

194
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,630
However...

195
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:47,567
Oh, boy...

196
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:52,944
Halloween isn't over,

197
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:55,249
and they're already
starting with Christmas.

198
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:08,108
<i>In January, Bart was awful,</i>

199
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:10,980
<i>put earthworms
in his father's waffle.</i>

200
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:13,418
<i>In February, the dead of winter,</i>

201
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:16,926
<i>Bart catfished teacher,
right on Tinder.</i>

202
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:19,832
<i>In March,
we saw the start of spring.</i>

203
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:22,804
<i>Bart unscrewed
the playground swing.</i>

204
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:25,309
<i>April's known for paying taxes.</i>

205
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,415
<i>For Bart, it's known
for nude butt faxes.</i>

206
00:13:28,482 --> 00:13:32,256
<i>- In May...
- Oh, how many months are there?!</i>

207
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:35,162
<i>In May we dance around a pole.</i>

208
00:13:35,229 --> 00:13:37,934
<i>Bart knocked it down
with a car he stole.</i>

209
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:39,805
<i>June is halfway through
the year.</i>

210
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:42,009
<i>Bart has a sip
of his first beer.</i>

211
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:44,313
<i>July is when the Bastille falls.</i>

212
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,052
<i>Bart cuts heads
off Lisa's dolls.</i>

213
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,925
<i>August is always a scorcher.</i>

214
00:13:49,992 --> 00:13:51,929
<i>Bart perfects
his turtle torture.</i>

215
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:54,568
<i>September,
Bart won't even mention.</i>

216
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:56,739
<i>He spends the whole month
in detention.</i>

217
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:58,943
<i>October ends with Halloween.</i>

218
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,014
<i>Bart eats candy till he's green.</i>

219
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,451
<i>In November,
Bart can carve the turkey.</i>

220
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,559
<i>He'll be serving human jerky.</i>

221
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,297
<i>Then, worst of all,
in cold December...</i>

222
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:13,940
R. I. P.

223
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:31,140
Lisa, we have
something to tell you.

224
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:33,679
We had a party
and didn't invite you.

225
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,986
It was a week ago.
We watched a cool TikTok.

226
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:39,123
But anyone
who watches the TikTok

227
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,294
dies after seven days.

228
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:43,633
I watched it first.

229
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:44,968
Oopsie!

230
00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:47,406
Finally, I'm not a twin anymore.

231
00:14:47,473 --> 00:14:50,513
I can have the top bunk and...

232
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,451
I killed Jerry and Larry.

233
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,324
Bart, have you heard
about this deadly TikTok?

234
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:59,463
Oh, yeah. Everyone was invited
to that party except you.

235
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,336
- Even Milhouse?
- I was the bouncer.

236
00:15:04,908 --> 00:15:07,714
Then I watched that
TikTok eight times.

237
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:12,524
I didn't watch it.
But you can if you want.

238
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:15,295
Nice try.

239
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:17,667
If we knew
what was in that video,

240
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,604
maybe we could stop it.

241
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:23,713
We just have to find someone

242
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:25,449
who isn't afraid of death

243
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:27,353
and likes to watch TV.

244
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:29,223
I'm your man.

245
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:34,200
But, Grampa, if you do watch,
you die in seven days.

246
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,605
That's three more
than the doctor gave me.

247
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:39,542
Okay.

248
00:15:39,578 --> 00:15:41,882
First,
there's an evil‐looking ring.

249
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:43,385
Then an empty chair.

250
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:45,389
Then a lady combing her hair.

251
00:15:45,455 --> 00:15:48,829
I like the old movies
where the combing was implied.

252
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:50,833
Now there's a bunch of maggots.

253
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,969
Satan head.

254
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,340
More maggots. More maggots.

255
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:56,277
No, wait,
that's an ad for Chipotle.

256
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:58,516
Now a woman's jumping
off a cliff,

257
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,586
and we end up
with an abandoned well.

258
00:16:00,653 --> 00:16:02,757
This is the kind of movie
you watch in a museum

259
00:16:02,824 --> 00:16:04,126
when your feet hurt.

260
00:16:04,193 --> 00:16:05,630
And my feet always hurt.

261
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,336
<i>Seven days.</i>

262
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:10,105
What?

263
00:16:10,172 --> 00:16:12,977
<i>Seven days.</i>

264
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:14,781
I can't hear ya.

265
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,085
Seven days.

266
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:18,956
Maybe I better jot this down.

267
00:16:19,023 --> 00:16:20,660
What was your name again?

268
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:27,507
I don't know who you are
or what you want,

269
00:16:27,574 --> 00:16:29,878
but let me give you
my credit card number.

270
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:31,849
I don't have time
for your nonsense.

271
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:33,117
We have bigger problems.

272
00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:35,523
Steroid allegations
on the kickball team.

273
00:16:37,392 --> 00:16:38,428
Psst.

274
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:41,702
I know about
your infernal TikTok.

275
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,083
This is the tragic tale
of a sad second‐grader.

276
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:51,220
Mopey Mary, they called her.

277
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:52,924
Kids can be so cruel.

278
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:57,499
Ooh, "Mopey." The worst thing
you can call someone in 1932.

279
00:16:57,567 --> 00:17:00,038
One cold February,

280
00:17:00,105 --> 00:17:02,409
<i>after receiving naught
in her Valentine's box</i>

281
00:17:02,476 --> 00:17:04,514
<i>but a poop
from the class rabbit,</i>

282
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:07,921
<i>poor Mary ran
to the old school well</i>

283
00:17:07,987 --> 00:17:09,456
<i>and threw herself in.</i>

284
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:11,895
<i>She was down there
for seven days</i>

285
00:17:11,962 --> 00:17:14,968
<i>before anyone bothered to look.</i>

286
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,707
<i>Fortunately,
it was the end of my shift.</i>

287
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:21,080
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

288
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:22,850
<i>We don't have a school well.</i>

289
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,086
<i>I covered it</i>

290
00:17:24,153 --> 00:17:26,658
<i>so no one would
ever go near it again.</i>

291
00:17:26,725 --> 00:17:29,531
They say the unhappy spirit
of Mopey Mary lurks

292
00:17:29,598 --> 00:17:33,304
in the murderous video
shared by popular children.

293
00:17:33,371 --> 00:17:35,610
Shouldn't you have
told the police first?

294
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:37,179
I tried to tell Wiggum.

295
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:39,551
He got scared and ran off.

296
00:17:40,485 --> 00:17:43,191
Daddy, that's my pee‐pee bed.

297
00:17:43,257 --> 00:17:45,563
Uh, not anymore.

298
00:17:49,504 --> 00:17:52,042
Looks like it's up to me
to save the school.

299
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:53,646
I can do this.

300
00:17:53,712 --> 00:17:55,482
Beware.

301
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:56,752
Milhouse?

302
00:17:56,818 --> 00:18:00,091
Yeah. It was really nice of
them to give me ghost glasses.

303
00:18:00,158 --> 00:18:01,528
Now, be careful, Lisa.

304
00:18:01,595 --> 00:18:04,099
And can you kill off
a Hershey bar for me?

305
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,037
I think that's how I get one.

306
00:18:06,103 --> 00:18:08,041
The rules aren't very clear
up here.

307
00:18:08,107 --> 00:18:09,711
I will.

308
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:20,933
<i>Seven days.</i>

309
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,037
- Coward!
<i>- Say what?</i>

310
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:25,175
I don't want to wait seven days.

311
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:27,412
So... come and get me now.

312
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:30,953
<i>Uh, I have to move
some stuff around; just a sec.</i>

313
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:36,464
<i>Killing you is very
important to us. Please hold.</i>

314
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:39,771
<i>Your curse will be answered
in the order it was received.</i>

315
00:18:39,838 --> 00:18:42,610
<i>Okay, um, how's Wednesday?</i>

316
00:18:42,677 --> 00:18:43,545
<i>I've got a guy coming to look at</i>

317
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:45,448
<i>the air conditioner
in the morning.</i>

318
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:48,421
Kill me now or kill me never.

319
00:18:48,488 --> 00:18:49,624
<i>Fine!</i>

320
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:03,451
Hello, Mary.
I'm not scared.

321
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,058
Um, would you mind taking those
black boots off in the house?

322
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,762
Oh, wait.

323
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:11,802
Those are your feet!

324
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:18,515
Um, I wanted to give you
something.

325
00:19:18,582 --> 00:19:21,220
Something that will change
the way you look at the world.

326
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,594
Here it is.

327
00:19:26,063 --> 00:19:28,434
A valentine? For me?

328
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,405
I want to be your friend.

329
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:31,975
I want to braid your hair

330
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,745
and see your beautiful face.

331
00:19:34,948 --> 00:19:36,852
Ah! All right. All right.

332
00:19:36,918 --> 00:19:38,889
We'll work with that. Oh...

333
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:40,391
You know why I'm smiling?

334
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,162
‐ ‐'Cause I have a best friend!

335
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:44,433
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Best friend?

336
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:46,370
I've already suffocated.

337
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:48,441
Give me a little space.

338
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:50,378
Okay, no problem.

339
00:19:50,445 --> 00:19:52,884
Hey, I wrote you
a song on the saxophone.

340
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,088
It's called "Well Bottom Blues."

341
00:19:59,162 --> 00:20:00,307
I'll tell you what.
I'm just gonna walk

342
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:01,267
right over here, okay?

343
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,471
You sound great.

344
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:06,010
I bet it sounds even better
from the bottom of the well.
