1
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:11,620
Don't rot your brain
on Satan's calculator.

2
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,231
Babies need real toys
like these.

3
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:24,371
- It's Princess Maggie.

4
00:00:24,415 --> 00:00:26,461
Princess Maggie's here.

5
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:28,245
Princess Maggie, what's wrong?

6
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:30,160
The girl is bored.

7
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,902
Royal court,
entertain my daughter at once.

8
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:36,079
No princess can frown
when her eardrums are pulsing

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,690
with the beat
of iambic pentameter.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,476
That's quite a frown.

11
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:43,173
Out of my way!

12
00:00:43,304 --> 00:00:46,263
I've got no shame
or regard for my own well-being.

13
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:48,570
Hey, hey!

14
00:00:50,354 --> 00:00:52,704
You fools have failed
the princess.

15
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,142
We have no other option.
We must give her...

16
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:57,492
- the special gift.

17
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,252
Goodbye, Princess Maggie.
Goodbye.

18
00:01:24,388 --> 00:01:25,389
<i>¡Ay, caramba!</i>

19
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,351
Oh, boy.

20
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:31,613
Homer,

21
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:33,832
your father's
messing up the baby again.

22
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:22,403
Way ahead of you, pal.

23
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:38,331
My eyes...

24
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,916
Where did all this traffic
come from?

25
00:02:58,047 --> 00:03:00,397
It's like my favorite
movie ever, <i>Cars 3.</i>

26
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:02,486
I hated <i>Cars 1 and 2.</i>

27
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:10,451
I'm unsupervised.

28
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:11,887
Have no fear.

29
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:13,932
Safety is here.

30
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:16,457
Traffic, no traffic...
What's the difference?

31
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:19,503
I got nothing to be late for
and no one who cares.

32
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:36,999
Let's take this from Disney+
to HBO Max.

33
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:44,180
Oh, Marge, you haven't honked

34
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:45,616
like this since high school.

35
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:47,662
It's a traffic jam.

36
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:57,411
My, my, look at all those middle
fingers raised to the Lord.

37
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:01,632
Wait a minute.
That car looks familiar.

38
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:03,634
Hey, that looks like...

39
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,422
No, don't go there, Moe.
Don't go there.

40
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:09,988
Erase, erase, erase!

41
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,092
Oh, come on.

42
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:28,920
We put up a sign and everything.

43
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:30,792
This is so unreal.

44
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:33,882
Why did all this traffic
suddenly appear on our street?

45
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:36,101
Wayz told me this was
the fastest route.

46
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:38,495
That's important when
you're selling your organs.

47
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:40,149
Oh, my God, I've heard of this.

48
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:41,542
That app routes traffic

49
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:43,457
through a quiet
residential neighborhood,

50
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:45,894
turning it into
a gridlocked nightmare.

51
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:55,338
Sorry, I met someone
in another car.

52
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:07,959
We need to do something.

53
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:10,222
This is driving
the neighborhood nuts.

54
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:12,616
Even the guy who's always
in his underwear.

55
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:14,488
This is more
than I put on for Zoom.

56
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:16,577
Enough with the traffic.

57
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:18,405
I'm calling
a neighborhood meeting.

58
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,756
<i>Neighborhood Meeting.</i>

59
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:23,671
<i>Neighborhood meeting.</i>

60
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:27,239
<i>Please rate my app.
Please rate my app.</i>

61
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,112
<i>Two stars? My IPO is ruined.</i>

62
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,636
<i>Ruined! Ruined!</i>

63
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,727
We're here to talk about

64
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:39,991
the terrible problem
on our street.

65
00:05:40,078 --> 00:05:41,993
- Finally.
- About time.

66
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,997
We assume you're talking
about you, the Simpsons.

67
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:47,216
Wha...?

68
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:48,870
I've seen the boy's moons
more times

69
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:51,089
than I've seen the real one,
and I'm an astronomer.

70
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:52,743
What's wrong with us?

71
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:55,746
You haven't stopped by
to say hello in 25 years,

72
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:57,618
and I live next door.

73
00:05:57,748 --> 00:06:00,795
The only good one's the baby,
and she shot a guy.

74
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,296
Wait, are we ignoring
the elephant in the room?

75
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,453
By which I mean
the big, fat husband.

76
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,542
Every time Homer
wears corduroys,

77
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:11,588
I just hear those thighs
scraping, scraping, scraping.

78
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:14,417
Oh, my God.
I'm starting to get the idea

79
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:16,550
you think
we're not good neighbors.

80
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:20,249
You see? You see?

81
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:22,120
Now, don't worry, my friends.

82
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:24,732
I'm stepping forward
to fix this traffic.

83
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:27,604
And by doing so, maybe...
just maybe I'll fix

84
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:30,085
my reputation with you all.

85
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:34,785
So just say to me what I say
to Tinker "I believe."

86
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,050
And... off I go.

87
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,276
Um... no.

88
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:49,670
"Identify all traffic lights."

89
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,845
Done.

90
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:52,281
"Identify all yield signs."

91
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:53,630
Done.

92
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:55,284
"Identify all the crosswalks."

93
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,809
Oh! Lisa, help me.

94
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,158
Done.

95
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:01,899
"Identify all fire hydrants."

96
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,030
Done.

97
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:04,380
Jesuits? Done.

98
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:06,077
20th-century dictators?

99
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,558
Uh, overrated fiction?

100
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:11,213
Hyperintelligent
cartoon characters?

101
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,084
Vegan nut milks?

102
00:07:13,215 --> 00:07:15,173
Future criminals?

103
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:17,262
Aah! New England doorways!

104
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:19,613
Oh, forget this.
I'm calling instead.

105
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:21,832
<i>You've reached
Wayz customer service.</i>

106
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:25,749
<i>You have 5,700 callers
ahead of you.</i>

107
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:29,144
<i>Now, please enjoy the frustrated
noises of other callers on hold.</i>

108
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,756
<i>I'm gonna blow my brains out.</i>

109
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:37,326
- You again?

110
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:41,983
Can it be her,
after all these years?

111
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,552
The woman I thought was the one
stuck behind my car?

112
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:02,569
Hi, Moe. I missed you.

113
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,440
I never should've left.

114
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:07,530
Maya. The longest,
best relationship of my life.

115
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:10,490
That was a great six days.

116
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,841
You're a good kisser.

117
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:16,365
Yeah.
I practice by siphoning gas

118
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,323
out of other people's tanks.

119
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:21,501
So, is there a knob or an
"open sesame" type deal or what?

120
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:23,372
My house is over there.

121
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,503
Wha...?

122
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,859
Every day since you left me,
I've written you a letter.

123
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:35,254
Really wish I had gotten
your address.

124
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:44,393
So, how you been, Maya?

125
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,700
Well, I finally got my PhD.

126
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,571
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

127
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,181
You taking medicine
for that or what?

128
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:51,835
Oh, Moe.

129
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:54,403
It's nice to laugh again.
How are you?

130
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,187
Oh, I-I'm doing great.

131
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:58,470
Yeah, the factory closed,
so there's lots of new drunks.

132
00:08:58,494 --> 00:09:00,409
And, uh, oh, the bathroom possum

133
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:02,759
is getting real good
at handing out them combs.

134
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:08,765
Who am I kidding?

135
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,811
My life is a wreck, Maya.

136
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:13,770
The face recognition software
on my phone says, "Yuck."

137
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:16,643
My playlist only has
breakup songs.

138
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,819
It's rough,
I'm telling you, yeah.

139
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:21,952
I miss you, Moses Marie Szyslak.

140
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:24,302
Oh, no, no, no.
Please don't give me that look.

141
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:27,131
I can't go through it
again, Maya. I can't.

142
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:30,004
Ah, just look at you walking
toward me, coming closer,

143
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:31,962
with those big green eyes
of yours

144
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:33,573
and the great-smelling hair,

145
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,445
skin smoother
than American cheese.

146
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:43,583
But I want a drink now.

147
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:52,983
Oh, I wish this moment could
last forever, like, uh...

148
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:55,856
uh, I don't know, uh,
Henry Winkler's career.

149
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:57,858
Boy, that guy
never jumped the shark.

150
00:09:57,988 --> 00:09:59,990
Not even when
he jumped the shark.

151
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:03,254
Just so I know, have you had
another girlfriend since me?

152
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:05,256
Uh, not really, no.

153
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:06,693
Uh, no one could match you.

154
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:09,217
I mean, I have been
catfished a few times.

155
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:10,784
Hey, Moe.

156
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:13,221
It's us, "Online Gloria."

157
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:15,484
I'll kill you!
Also, I love you.

158
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:20,663
Oh, Moe, you poor guy.

159
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,927
<i>Oh, everything is perfect.</i>

160
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:27,452
<i>Which it always is
until I say, "I love you."</i>

161
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:31,979
I love you.

162
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:40,074
I love you. Will you marry me?

163
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:47,734
To hell with women.

164
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:49,779
I love you, New York.

165
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,740
Help me. Spider-Man!

166
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,923
Professor, can you get
the traffic off our street?

167
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:04,576
I'll give you anything
except for money

168
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,100
or credit for what you did.

169
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:09,625
The only way to defeat
a global data behemoth

170
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:12,193
is to get into the source code.

171
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:15,196
Just look what I did here
on, uh... on the Wikipedia.

172
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:21,376
<i>Welcome to Wayz.</i>

173
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:24,422
<i>We figure out the fastest route
to get you where you want to go.</i>

174
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:26,903
<i>Our secret?
Always collecting data.</i>

175
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,036
<i>But we would never misuse it.</i>

176
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,602
<i>Who do you think we are, Google?</i>

177
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,343
<i>We're owned by Google.</i>

178
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:34,171
I've got the answer.

179
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:36,957
What if we made your street...

180
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,436
not exist?

181
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,351
Well, where would we live?

182
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:42,179
Well, that's quite silly.

183
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,226
It would, of course,
still exist in real life,

184
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,968
but I could make it disappear
from the database.

185
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,754
- All right, let us see here.

186
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:53,974
Uh, keystrokes, keystrokes,
escape key,

187
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:57,107
both colon and semicolon,
backslash, backslash,

188
00:11:57,238 --> 00:12:00,981
ampersand...

189
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:03,548
we come to a new day
on "no such street."

190
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:13,471
Never again
will we be afraid of cars.

191
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:16,213
Get thee out of my way, English!

192
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:19,390
It's time to play
in the streets!

193
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:21,828
Haw-haw!

194
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:31,315
Climate change is real.

195
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:37,800
They know I did this.

196
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:40,237
They're making eye contact
with me. Eye contact.

197
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:42,936
Even the guy
with the boat in his driveway.

198
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,199
Hey, hey, Homer, want to come
on my boat with me?

199
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:46,200
In the water?

200
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:47,636
Eh, we'll see.

201
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:48,723
Uh, one step at a time.

202
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:50,595
I will never get tired of this.

203
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:53,033
Never. Never, ever.

204
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:56,297
So, what do you feel like doing?

205
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:58,647
I don't know, I...
I feel like singing.

206
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:25,761
Hey, are you guys an item again?

207
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:28,416
Well, maybe, maybe.

208
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:29,983
We definitely are.

209
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:31,985
He has a toothbrush at my place.

210
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:33,943
Yeah, but, yeah, it's a rental.

211
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:36,728
Moe's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

212
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:39,122
And this time, it's gonna last.

213
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:41,124
Way to go, Moe. Three cheers.

214
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:42,691
Hip, hip, hooray!

215
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,128
Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip...

216
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,565
Homer, come in
the alley with me.

217
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:50,351
My doctor warned me not
to cut off a "hip, hip, hooray."

218
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:54,268
Look, Maya left me once.

219
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:56,096
I just know she's gonna
leave me again.

220
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:58,228
This-this is a disaster.

221
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:01,101
You're the only guy here who
knows how to hold on to a woman.

222
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:03,364
What is your secret?
How do you keep Midge?

223
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:05,453
Well, it's, uh... it's, um...

224
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,933
Hmm.

225
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:08,717
It helps
if you get them pregnant.

226
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:11,459
Please, I need some actual,
real advice here.

227
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:13,200
Yeah, I better call Midge.

228
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:14,679
Hello.

229
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,290
Honey, I'm here in the alley
with Moe.

230
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:18,094
The only woman
who ever loved him came back,

231
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:19,791
and he's afraid
she's gonna leave him again.

232
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:20,947
What should he do?

233
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:22,731
Hand him the phone.

234
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,081
Moe, trust love.

235
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:26,387
Gotcha.

236
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:27,649
Your wife's an idiot.

237
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:29,346
Another tray of doughnuts.

238
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:31,174
This time from
that family over there.

239
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:33,698
Geez, I can't take
all this adulation.

240
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,962
This must be what drove
Randy Quaid crazy.

241
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:37,528
Mr. Simpson, will you throw out

242
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:39,356
the first pitch
at my Little League game?

243
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:41,619
Want to have coffee
on my boat in the parking lot?

244
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:43,186
Do you ever take it
in the water?

245
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,492
Not yet.

246
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:46,407
Please, I'm just here to eat.

247
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:48,191
Geez, you were mad
they didn't like you,

248
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,193
and now you're mad
they like you.

249
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,674
I just want to be left alone
with my to-do list.

250
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,197
Excuse me.

251
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:56,156
Will you be godfather
to my baby?

252
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:57,505
Let me see it.

253
00:14:57,635 --> 00:14:59,550
Ugh. Pass.

254
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:02,205
Okay, Moe.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

255
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:03,903
I'm just getting
some stuff for dinner.

256
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,774
- Love you.
- Mwah.

257
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,689
Love you, too.

258
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:10,257
<i>Moe. Oh, Moe.</i>

259
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:12,650
Huh?

260
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:14,739
Look at you. Look at us.

261
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,872
She's not gonna come back.

262
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:19,353
- They never come back.
- Oh, yeah?

263
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,529
Well, this time,
I'm not gonna listen to mirrors

264
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:23,096
or mud puddles

265
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:25,576
or my upside-down face
in a spoon.

266
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:27,709
This time, I'm gonna believe.

267
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:29,580
Oh, no, you're not.

268
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:32,583
No one could love you.

269
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,281
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

270
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:35,998
What does it take
to get a beer around here?

271
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,240
Shut up!

272
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:39,460
Shut up?
I would stop coming here

273
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:41,655
if you weren't the only place
in stumbling distance.

274
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,246
You are not real.

275
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,161
You're just that nagging
voice of self-doubt

276
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:46,771
that lives in my head.

277
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:48,991
That's right.
Easy in, easy out.

278
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:50,645
Well, this time,
I'm gonna stop you

279
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:52,734
before you wreck my life.

280
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:58,000
Now you're a loser
with seven years bad luck.

281
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:19,065
I guess what
we're trying to say is...

282
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,895
You're right.

283
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,306
You beautiful bastards
are right.

284
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:30,990
- Mm-hmm.
- Ah, yeah.

285
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:36,299
Huh? What the...?

286
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,649
Moe? You're hiding here?

287
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:41,217
Yeah. Bart's treehouse
is the one place

288
00:16:41,304 --> 00:16:43,045
no one will look for me.

289
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:44,612
Plus, there are
no girls allowed,

290
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:46,918
which, uh, helps.

291
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,877
Moe's going through
a tough time, son.

292
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:50,183
Just play around him.

293
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:52,074
We'll just pretend
he's a dead, rotting alien.

294
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:53,316
Thank you, son.

295
00:16:57,973 --> 00:16:59,975
The alien's alive!

296
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:01,977
- And it has feelings.
- Kill him!

297
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:13,467
I'm sorry, no breakfast

298
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:15,251
until you get Moe out
of the treehouse.

299
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:19,255
And I'll keep your bacon safe
while you're gone.

300
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:23,346
Thank God I have
my pocket bacon.

301
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:27,959
Moe, you can't stay here
anymore.

302
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,353
Sure, I can. Uh, you want
some eggs with that?

303
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,138
I got 'em out of that nest
over there.

304
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:33,574
Just one.

305
00:17:33,748 --> 00:17:35,489
I don't want to be rude.

306
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:37,708
Listen, Moe,
every once in a while,

307
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:41,147
a beautiful woman falls in love
with a homely guy like us.

308
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:42,887
You got to make the most of it.

309
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:46,239
If Kevin James can find
happiness, why can't you?

310
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:48,545
And he was always
wearing shorts.

311
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:51,157
You know, after all these years,
I dated all these women,

312
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:53,811
and it always just goes back
to square one.

313
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:55,813
Lonely old Moe.

314
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:57,685
Well, there is
a way around that.

315
00:17:57,815 --> 00:17:59,165
You could propose.

316
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,123
Wha...?

317
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:03,952
What are you proposing
I propose?

318
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,607
I mean the big "M."

319
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:08,609
- Murder-suicide?
- No.

320
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:11,133
- Marriage.
- Marriage? Whoa.

321
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:13,024
You mean I could have
the thing you're always

322
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:15,094
coming into my bar
and moaning about?

323
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:18,749
You know what? She's worth it.

324
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,534
I'll give it a shot.

325
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,191
Okay. This is as far as we go.

326
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:27,062
Yeah, yeah, okay.

327
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:28,629
Let me just
straighten myself up.

328
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:48,605
You'd better speak fast,
or for the second time,

329
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:50,433
you're gonna lose
the first good thing

330
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,087
that's ever happened to you.

331
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:54,002
I'm so sorry.
You're great, so great,

332
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:55,209
and all I've been is afraid.

333
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:00,878
But all I got to do
is look in your eyes.

334
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:02,967
Baby, I love you so much.

335
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:05,622
You stick with me, you'll get
everything you ever wanted.

336
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:07,450
I will never doubt you again.

337
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:09,017
You can control the remote.

338
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,324
You can pick all our vacations.

339
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:13,935
And because I know
the ladies like it this way,

340
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:16,633
I will leave the toilet seat on.

341
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:19,462
Maya, will you marry me?

342
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,555
Forget it, loser.

343
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:27,818
Gorillas like us
don't get the girl.

344
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:30,952
We're lucky if our cage
gets hosed down once a week.

345
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,475
Yes.

346
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,434
I knew it! That's it.

347
00:19:34,564 --> 00:19:36,044
I'm never getting up again.

348
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,829
Staying here, on the ground.

349
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,788
Wait, you-you said yes.

350
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:43,269
Yes, Moe. Yes.

351
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:15,866
Good song, but, uh,
the movie is crap.

352
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:23,396
What is it, Mosie?

353
