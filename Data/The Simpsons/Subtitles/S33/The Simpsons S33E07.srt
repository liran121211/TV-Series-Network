1
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,052
This just in...

2
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,756
Chief, I think
that madman who shot up

3
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:25,092
the Lard Lad
knows where Homer is.

4
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:28,562
Look, he dropped this
on his way out.

5
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:29,930
Have you been crying?

6
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,099
It's just so horrible.

7
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,801
Mr. Burns? The Disco Guy?

8
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,203
Fat Tony?

9
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:39,907
Look what they did
to my beautiful goombah.

10
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:46,313
I can't ever eat a donut again.

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,282
Chief, pull yourself together.

12
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,117
My husband is still missing.

13
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,754
And I hate to say it,
but I think Ned Flanders

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,522
has something to do with this.

15
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:56,823
Open your eyes, Marge.

16
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,258
If Homer's mixed up in this,

17
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,361
he's probably a cruller by now.

18
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:04,198
Satan himself has come
to this town,

19
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:07,401
and I'm not man enough
to take him on.

20
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:10,637
If you see Lou,
tell him Eddie's chief now.

21
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,681
The killer's driving
the Rich Texan's car.

22
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,352
Hmm...

23
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,591
<i>Police describe
the mysterious assailant</i>

24
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:34,194
<i>as a grim metaphor
for a universe without justice.</i>

25
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,463
That's the may‐diddly‐aniac
who's got Homer.

26
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,332
How am I gonna come up
with that ransom?

27
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,934
I can't do a GoFundMe
for a kidnapping.

28
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,469
There's too many
of those already.

29
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,305
Oh, Granddad, I donated
that money to the orphans

30
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,941
in honor of your decency, but...

31
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:49,810
now I need it back.

32
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,546
How'd all that cash
get in that tree anyway?

33
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,725
I want my haircut to look

34
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:07,394
just as square
as yours, Paw Paw.

35
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,331
Careful there, barber.

36
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,100
I wouldn't want you
to nick the neck

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,536
of the town's favorite sheriff.

38
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:18,205
The Szyslak brothers.

39
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,174
Hey, hey, we don't want
no trouble, fellas.

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,875
Someone call the zoo,

41
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:25,345
the ape house is missing
its ugliest baboons.

42
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:28,081
You got no call
pointing out our ugliness.

43
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:32,119
That's why it's time
you got what's coming to you.

44
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,989
Cy, take the boy outside.

45
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:47,434
You got something for me?
Let me have it.

46
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,677
Ah, my favorite time of day,

47
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,545
bribe o'clock.

48
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,814
Ooh, and thicker than usual.

49
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,249
That's what I came to tell you.

50
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,718
We made a deal
with the Capital City Mob.

51
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:07,187
We're slinging amphetamines now.

52
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,590
That's right, "Brain fizz."

53
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,091
"Trucker's milk."

54
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,227
"Texas Teeth looseners."

55
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,428
Long as I get my cut,

56
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,764
I don't care if you sell rat
crap and call them Milk Duds.

57
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,335
Now, Slocum, I've got
a sterling reputation to uphold.

58
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,912
You mind if I punch
one of your brothers

59
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,013
through this plate glass window?

60
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,806
Nah, take your pick.

61
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,681
Paw Paw, you're the finest man
I'll ever know.

62
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,383
Yes, I am, Neddy.

00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,650
‐Hmm? ‐Time to earn your keep.

72
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:23,197
Gentlemen, your primo crank
is selling like meth on speed.

73
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,101
Just give it to our numbers guy.

74
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,943
One hundred seventy‐three
thousand, two hundred and...

75
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,078
ninety‐six dollars.

76
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:41,315
Yeah, that's even more money
back now in the early '70s.

77
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,952
Which made me wonder,
why should we share?

78
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,622
Uh... uh...

79
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:58,298
Oh, God, all right, fellas,
why don't we all relax

80
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,634
and put down our crazy
assortment of weapons?

81
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,537
I'm talking to you,
Mr. Dynamite Nunchucks.

82
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,074
The tiniest little thing

83
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:10,377
could turn this standoff
into a bloodbath.

84
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,948
Oh, shoot.

85
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:37,938
Dear Lord, you know me,
I'm a good time Charlie,

86
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,640
but if you see fit
to save my hide,

87
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,644
I promise to become the kind of
man my grandson can be proud of.

88
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,045
Hmm?

89
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:55,722
My whole family, they're dead.

90
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,925
I don't got to share this
with no one.

91
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,962
Sorry, God, but hey,

92
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,797
you can only send me
to Hell once.

93
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,800
Hmm? Hmm.

94
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,174
Fellas, Sheriff Flanders here.

95
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,445
The money, where is it?

96
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,647
Okay, hey, okay.

97
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,849
Easy, friend.

98
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,817
It's all yours, I promise.

99
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,419
Just don't..

100
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,490
Ah...

101
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,959
Oh, come on.

102
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,194
So frustrating.

103
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,431
Well, there goes my life.

104
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,649
Oh, Paw Paw,

105
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,318
I've lived my whole life trying
to be as fine a man as you,

106
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:01,522
but Homer Simpson's gonna die
unless I do the unthinkable:

107
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:05,259
steal back the money
I gave to these orphans.

108
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,696
We love you, Mr. Flanders!

109
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,447
Oh, Colette.

110
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,784
There appears to be
a trail of rose petals

111
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,186
leading to the master bath.

112
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,854
I wonder who
could've left them there?

113
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,326
Oh, come now.
You're still cross?

114
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:42,229
For the last time,
we can't just turn down jobs

115
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,931
because it's our anniversary.

116
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:47,467
Wait, you international
psychos are married?

117
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,636
That's none of your concern,
you shorn sheep.

118
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:50,637
Huh?

119
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,639
Tell him, how many year?

120
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,142
How many year?

121
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,678
Ten years of wedded bliss.

122
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,746
Each year sweeter than the last.

123
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:05,285
Not one vacation.

124
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:08,088
We don't get to take vacations
if we don't take jobs.

125
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,257
It's called math, darling.

126
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:14,962
Hm, wow, if I said something
that sexist,

127
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:17,130
my wife would be furious.

128
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,333
You see?
Even the dead man knows.

129
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,402
Look, the best marriage advice
I ever got was,

130
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,506
"If you're thinking it,
just say it."

131
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,442
Really? Then I should
tell her that every day

132
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:32,045
she becomes more and more
like her mother.

133
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,915
My mother was twice the assassin
you will ever be.

134
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:39,520
What did Dr. Pam say
about acting on anger?

135
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,124
You tell her, Irish guy.

136
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,926
Go for the eyes, Frenchie.

137
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:48,729
Whoever wins
was right all along.

138
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,802
‐Hey!
- Oh!

139
00:08:57,437 --> 00:09:01,175
Uh, guys? There's a little fire
situation in the kitchen here.

140
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:04,945
Okay, you're communicating
honestly, which is great.

141
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,748
What say we focus on
achievable goals as a couple,

142
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,616
like putting out this fire?

143
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:11,652
Phew.

144
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:12,886
D'oh!

145
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:15,756
‐Ah! ‐Never go to bed angry?

146
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,424
Cuddling doesn't always
lead to sex?

147
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:21,361
You're not just married killers,
you're homicidal best friends.

148
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,201
Happy anniversary?

149
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,740
Ah, you're a corker,
my violent femme.

150
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,315
Aw, I knew you crazy kids
could make it work.

151
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,984
Now, we should probably
get out of here before the‐‐

152
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,754
You guys okay?

153
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:59,566
The key to this safe
has to be here somewhere.

154
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:06,273
What in the blue heck
are you doing here?

155
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,042
Last I saw, you were judging

156
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,411
my God‐given right
to an open marriage.

157
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:14,882
Uh, Barb, I'm in
serious trouble.

158
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,016
The thing is, uh...

159
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:19,119
Fish or get off the hole,
Mr. Flanders.

160
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,693
I haven't been able
to get that spiffy bod of yours

161
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:30,063
out of my dang‐diddly mind.

162
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,699
Jumpin' jiminy.

163
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:39,173
<i>You can do this, Neddy.</i>

164
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,376
<i>Just think about Homer Simpson.</i>

165
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,787
Oh, Homie.
I thought I'd lost you.

166
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:58,058
Oh, Marge, I'm so sorry.

167
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,794
I'll never be selfish again.

168
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:05,299
Whew! Wasn't that a brisk walk
around Lake How‐do‐ya‐do?

169
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,901
I'm gonna get a Faygo
from the mini fridge.

170
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,036
Do you want one?

171
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,638
Uh, grape, if they have it.

172
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:23,050
That gosh darn thief.

173
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,587
Uff‐da!

174
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:28,488
I got away with it.

175
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:30,490
I got away with...

176
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,595
I'm sorry, God.

177
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:38,131
I‐I just want Homer Simpson
to be okay.

178
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:45,506
Oh, there he is.

179
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:52,145
Ned. Buddy.
Let's get you out of there.

180
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:01,421
Ow!

181
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,828
Oh, I saved you.

182
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:10,397
You're finally mine.

183
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:17,137
I'm married to the most
selfish man in the world.

184
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,972
Everybody, all around,

185
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,276
look at this man.

186
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:26,046
He saved the orphans' money
and the flag.

187
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,282
Look at the burns
on his saintly arm.

188
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,885
Oh, this husky gent
is an American hero.

189
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:38,458
Not like that snake,
Ned Flanders.

190
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,196
Why, he stole this money
after trying to seduce me

191
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:45,832
out of my happily‐closed
marriage to Sideshow Mel.

192
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,668
Oh, uh...

193
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,036
That monster!

194
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,739
Where is he, so that
I might thrash him?

195
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:55,342
He's right over...

196
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:02,916
<i>Hello, church chum.</i>

197
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,786
I, um...
I don't have your money.

198
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,654
And I don't have your man.

199
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,189
Funny how things work out.

200
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,025
I committed every sin
in the book to get that money‐‐

201
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,928
except sloth, I guess‐‐
and now it's gone.

202
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,297
Money can be lost, Mr. Flanders,

203
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,900
but a debt never goes away.

204
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,869
I am coming to collect.

205
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:25,038
When you least expect it,
expect it.

206
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,541
‐You mean now? ‐No, not now.

207
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:30,611
Well, you saying not now
makes me expect it more.

208
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:33,413
Look, this is the one time
you shouldn't expect it,

209
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,483
but every other time,
do expect it.

210
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,626
<i>Three years ago,
Homer Simpson risked his life</i>

211
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:46,960
<i>to save an orphanage's future.</i>

212
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,696
And now, I'm here
to save your car's future.

213
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,231
Oil changes, alignment,

214
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,800
and brake pads,
brake pads, brake pads.

215
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,303
All at Heroic Lube and Tire.

216
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,939
<i>Where Route 4 meets
Disco Stu Memorial Drive.</i>

217
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,009
<i>Just look for the inflatable me.</i>

218
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:04,645
Mr. Simpson, may I just say

219
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:08,048
it is an honor to get
my washer fluid from you.

220
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:11,418
Yo, can I get a selfie
with that gnarly arm?

221
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,221
What's it like to be married

222
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:16,490
to the most beloved man
in Springfield?

223
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:19,159
Every day's
better than the last.

224
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:20,460
Now come back soon

225
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,697
'cause you'll always get
a hero's welcome.

226
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,300
I get it.

227
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:30,270
"Hero." The word makes me
sick to my stomach.

228
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,810
I'll never forget
seeing you choose the money

229
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,213
instead of saving Ned. Never.

230
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:42,916
I wish I could explain,
but I can't.

231
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:45,485
I would've left this
godforsaken marriage

232
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,821
years ago if it
wasn't for the kids‐‐

233
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,023
‐My special little guy!
‐There he is.

234
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,024
Check it out.

235
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:53,227
I got my
Online Citizenship badge

236
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,495
for being so polite
on social media.

237
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,765
You're going to be the youngest
Eagle Scout in town.

238
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:00,400
Well, I am half hero.

239
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:05,706
I got 100 RSVPs
to my birthday party.

240
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,410
They probably just want
to come to meet you.

241
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,379
Got some mail, Dad.

242
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:15,516
Why'd you get a blank postcard
from Wyoming?

243
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:18,519
Hm, that's weird.

244
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,554
Probably just junk.

245
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,741
Don't shoot, you little weirdos.

246
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,944
Daddy, it's Mr. Simpson.

247
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:20,013
Hiddly‐ho, neighborino.

248
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,384
So, how are things
in good old Springfield?

249
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,353
Uh... it's okay.

250
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,355
Jailbird got super religious.

251
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:31,491
And Marge hates me.

252
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:35,128
Our marriage is deader
than Disco Stu.

253
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:38,098
All because I tried
to save that money's life

254
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,766
and not yours.

255
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,336
That money made sinners
of us all.

256
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,204
Can I tell you something, Homer?

257
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,707
I wanted people
to know I donated it.

258
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:48,942
I wanted the attention.

259
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,011
I brought all of this upon us.

260
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:52,813
We both suck.

261
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:57,584
Equally.

262
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,823
Oh, no. He's tracked you here.

263
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:04,958
No way. I took
all the precautions,

264
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:06,827
even the mariachi Ferris wheel.

265
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,298
What is it, Homer?

266
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,400
A mistress? A secret family?

267
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,270
You'd better not be
a sports podcaster.

268
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,472
Ned?

269
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,807
Don't be too sore
at this fella, Marge.

270
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:22,409
Homer's been
our lifeline up here:

271
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:25,379
food, shelter,
books he thinks I'd like.

272
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:27,481
They certainly were
a motley crew.

273
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:31,285
This is the most selfless thing
you've ever done,

274
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,120
and you didn't even tell anyone.

275
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,756
I couldn't say anything,
or Ned would be in danger.

276
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:38,792
There's this crazy psycho
who wants to kill him, and‐‐

277
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:40,459
Hey, you weren't
followed here, were you?

278
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,544
Great, more walking.

279
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:00,147
Homie, if we don't make it,

280
00:18:00,214 --> 00:18:03,684
I need you to know
that you are a decent man,

281
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,886
and I love you.

282
00:18:05,953 --> 00:18:08,689
No. I won't put you two
in any more danger.

283
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,557
I'm the one he wants.

284
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,228
‐Okay. Bye. 
‐Phew. Good luck.

285
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,952
It's been a long time,
Mr. Flanders.

286
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:41,088
Now, will you
be paying your debt

287
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:43,690
in money or blood?

288
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:47,227
Blood it is.

289
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:51,532
Ah, balance.

290
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,068
Balance? Is that what
this blood‐soaked rigmarole

291
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:57,471
has been all about? Why?

292
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:01,575
You ever hear the parable
of Lucifer and the millipede?

293
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:03,544
One day, a tiny...

294
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:07,481
The end.

295
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:08,815
Oh, just kill me already.

296
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,817
I deserve it for stealing,

297
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:13,153
seducing, fibbing.

298
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,989
I tarnished the good name
of my Paw Paw,

299
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,358
Sherriff Ned Flanders.

300
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:23,530
Your grandfather was dirtier
than a hobo's handkerchief.

301
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,801
Why, he even killed a man
in cold blood for that money.

302
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:28,902
No!

303
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:31,638
He was nothing
but a good time Charlie.

304
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:33,707
I'll kill you!
