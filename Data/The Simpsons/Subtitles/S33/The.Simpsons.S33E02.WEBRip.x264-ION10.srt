1
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,178
We sure lucked out
with this new gig.

2
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:12,580
Half day on Christmas,
unpaid polio leave,

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,682
and all the bread crumbs
you can sweep.

4
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,288
Mac, we just
got our first paychecks.

5
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,790
Take this money
and turn it into giggle water.

6
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,793
FICA?!

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,960
What the hell is that?

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,962
Eh, that's your
Social Security tax.

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,964
Government takes our money,

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,202
then gives it back
when you retire in 50 years.

11
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:36,804
What? Stupid government
thinks it's smarter than me.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,372
I can handle my money.

13
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:41,142
Put five bucks
on any two animals fighting.

14
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:43,377
And I'll eat the loser.

15
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,546
We're not gonna
need Social Security.

16
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:46,714
We're gonna be rich.

17
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:49,383
Yeah, we'll never
need government help.

18
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,285
Help me, government!

19
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,954
We need our
Social Security checks.

20
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,990
Make rain a modest,
fixed amount.

21
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:25,519
Hmm.

22
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,520
Hmm.

23
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,722
Now, this is what
I call cribbage.

24
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,258
Abe wins again!

25
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,994
Another great day in the books.

26
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,764
Now to cap it all off
with a medicated foot bath

27
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:40,100
and a nice, deep-ear Q-tipping.

28
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:50,744
Hello?

29
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,880
<i>Grandfather!
You've got to help me!</i>

30
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,283
What?
Is that you, Bart?

31
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:57,885
<i>That's right.
It's me, Bart.</i>

32
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,120
<i>I'm so scared.
I'm in jail!</i>

33
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:02,523
- Jail?
-<i> Please don't tell my dad or mom.</i>

34
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,293
<i>Hey'll be so mad. The policemanT
needs to talk to you.</i>

35
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,561
<i>Sir, your grandson
is in big trouble.</i>

36
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,398
No, not Bart.
My little angel.

37
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,301
<i>Well, he was arrested for
andalism and shoplifting, sir. v</i>

38
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:16,069
Yeah, that sounds like Bart,
that little devil.

39
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,282
<i>F you don't send his bail moneyl
in the next 90 minutes,</i>

40
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,773
<i>he's going straight
to the downtown</i>

41
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,275
<i>juvenile detention center.</i>

42
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,711
<i>Grandfather! Help me! Please!</i>

43
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,112
Don't worry, Bart.

44
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:27,147
Just tell me what you need
and I'll do it.

45
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,417
Your Grampa loves you.

46
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,288
I need to wire some money
to an overseas account

47
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:37,258
to bail my grandson
out of an unnamed jail.

48
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,059
Fill out this form.

49
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,762
I didn't know my little Emma
was in Colombia,

50
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,965
let alone
working as a drug mule.

51
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,268
I'm just thankful
the Russian secret police

52
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:49,837
will accept the title
to my Lexus.

53
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,908
<i>Mr. Simpson, we've
confirmed receipt.</i>

54
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,644
<i>Your grandson
will be released...</i>

55
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:58,246
Oh, thank God.

56
00:02:58,346 --> 00:02:59,947
<i>Once you pay
his processing fees,</i>

57
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,683
<i>holding cell costs
and handcuff tax.</i>

58
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,286
It's on its way,
plus a little extra

59
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:08,188
for you being so helpful.

60
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:10,658
Did he reach out to his father?
His mother?

61
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,360
His dead grandmother?

62
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,362
No.
He came to me.

63
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,830
Because Bart knew that
he could count on his Grampa

64
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,533
to get him
out of any kind of jam.

65
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,270
Mm.

66
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,172
Oh, thank goodness you're out!

67
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,043
Okay, okay,
enough with the smooches.

68
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,446
I don't care what you've done.
All that matters

69
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,182
is that no grandson of mine's
gonna go to jail.

70
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:37,718
Jail?
Are you off your meds

71
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:38,886
or on new meds?

72
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:41,221
Bart, don't you remember?

73
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:44,157
I just wired all that money
to pay your bail.

74
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,027
Whoa, Grampa,
I think you were...

75
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,228
scammed.

76
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,998
Me, scammed?

77
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,366
That's impossible.

78
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,968
No one hornswoggles Abraham J...

79
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,537
S-I-M-P-S-O-N.

80
00:03:56,637 --> 00:04:00,341
Social Security number:
327-00-3658.

81
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,343
First pet's name: Homer.

82
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,246
I've been hornswoggled.

83
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,083
<i>You're watching
the Punt Zone channel.</i>

84
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:11,852
<i>It's nothing but punts.</i>

85
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,921
<i>Never miss another
exciting fair catch</i>

86
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:17,358
<i>or thrilling second
of hang time.</i>

87
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:19,560
<i>It's fourth and long,
here's the snap.</i>

88
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,363
<i>It's a fake punt!
Cut away! Cut away!</i>

89
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:26,033
Guys, something happened
to Grampa.

90
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,935
I got bamboozled out of my money

91
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,604
by a flimflam artist.

92
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:33,006
It's not his fault.
Some scammer

93
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,675
convinced him I was in jail.

94
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,944
I'm so sorry, Grampa.

95
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:40,280
Um, uh, let me
go microwave your slippers.

96
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:42,850
I don't deserve warm toes.

97
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,720
I'm nothing but a feeble,
useless, old idjit.

98
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,057
No. You were just trying
to be a good grandparent.

99
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,793
And one bad apple
took advantage of you.

100
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,262
You got nothing
to feel bad about.

101
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:59,467
Bart in jail? I would have
fallen for that, too.

102
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:00,877
I mean, how much money
could they have taken

103
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,770
from a retired,
old meatball man...

104
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,906
50 bucks plus a pocketful
of hard candies?

105
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,809
Here you go, Dad. I'll cover it.
What's the damage?

106
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,579
Ten thousand dollars!

107
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,915
Where the hell
did you get that kind of money,

108
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,217
you broken-down
old meatball man?

109
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,753
It's 20 years
of my cribbage winnings,

110
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,155
saved up in a cigar box.

111
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:25,993
I was gonna leave it to you,
and now it's all gone.

112
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,498
No. No.

113
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:31,999
No!

114
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:36,103
I had an inheritance
and you gave it away?

115
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,572
I'm so mad I could kill you,

116
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,474
but now I'd get nothing.

117
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,510
I hope you live forever!

118
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,518
Now to read Abraham J. Simpson's

119
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,953
final will and testament.

120
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,822
To my surviving Homers,

121
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:57,024
I leave you $10,000

122
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:59,693
- that I never told you about...

123
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,429
- Oh! - Huh? - Yeah?

124
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,831
But then I lost it all
to a scam.

125
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,433
So, because I'm a moron,

126
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,267
I leave you nothing.

127
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,336
D'oh!

128
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:11,038
Ten thousand dollars!

129
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,140
That dream again?

130
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,943
The money's gone, gone.

131
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:19,447
But how can you miss money
you never knew you had?

132
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:22,182
That's the worst part:
to find out got money,

133
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,384
but you lost money,
so you have it,

134
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:25,786
but you don't have it.

135
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,988
Oh, it's giving me whipcash.

136
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,528
Just think of all the ways
my life could have been better

137
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,964
with that ten grand.

138
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:45,906
Oh.

139
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,411
So, uh, we're asking each family
to chip in $50

140
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,814
for a new
fundraising thermometer.

141
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,050
Oh, yeah, 50 bucks...
I would totally donate that

142
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,351
if my father hadn't

143
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,555
given away $10,000!

144
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,324
Um, it's just
a suggested amount.

145
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,995
Sure, ten grand might not
sound like much to you teachers,

146
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,564
but I choose inheriting $10,000

147
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,601
over earning a million.

148
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,168
And all of you
would do the same!

149
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,170
Homer, not here.

150
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,573
Because generational wealth
is the purest,

151
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,742
most sacred kind of money
there is.

152
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:24,678
But my father fell for
some super-obvious scam

153
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,947
because his brain is made of

154
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,416
powdered mashed potatoes.

155
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:33,353
So, no, I will not be donating.

156
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,168
- Oh... - Marge, if I may, I-I
dealt with a similar situation

157
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,894
with my mother.
She got a phone call

158
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,130
claiming punk rockers were
threatening to cut my hair

159
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,866
into a Mohawk, which is
a distinctive hairstyle...

160
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,134
I know what it is.

161
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,102
This place got us through it.

162
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,938
Hmm.

163
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,073
This could be just what we need.

164
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,075
Oh, uh, sorry,
that's not for you to keep.

165
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,377
I don't get many business cards.

166
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,616
Group therapy? In my day,
we dealt with horrible shame

167
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,218
by getting blind drunk,
stumbling into a hobo camp

168
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,920
and fighting their king.

169
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,222
Sometimes it worked,
sometimes it didn't.

170
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,791
Just give it a try, Abe.

171
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,627
It'll help to know
that you're not alone.

172
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,064
Nice, Marge.

173
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,633
Making Dad sit through
a pathetic sob-fest

174
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,936
with his fellow losers
is the perfect punishment.

175
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,172
There's a group for you, too.

176
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:30,510
I... wish I never voted
to build this community center.

177
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,481
I should have known
mortgage lenders

178
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,850
don't take
Applebee's gift cards.

179
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,150
He said if I didn't wire
the money to the power company,

180
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,321
they'd shut off my electricity.

181
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,791
I <i>am</i> the power company.

182
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,025
Catfished.
Ooh!

183
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,994
Now it seems so obvious

184
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,963
that I would never meet
the real Melissa Joan Hart

185
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,299
in a online billiards forum.

186
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,002
These criminals
target the good in all of us,

187
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,370
so the first step
is to take a deep breath

188
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,640
and forgive ourselves.

189
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:07,214
My mother paid hackers to return
her stolen computer photos.

190
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,516
They weren't gone.
They were backed up

191
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:12,285
to the cloud, Dropbox,
Time Machine...

192
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,521
Things of that nature.

193
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:17,658
Now, these are the things you
should never say to a victim.

194
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,827
"I would never
have fallen for that,"

195
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,295
"Everyone knows
about that scam,"

196
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,632
and "What were you thinking?"

197
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:26,700
I would have never
fallen for that!

198
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,568
Everyone knows about that scam!

199
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,671
What were you thinking?!

200
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:32,172
No, it wasn't my fault.

201
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,875
This group taught me
not to feel shame.

202
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,045
I'm on a path of healing
and self-empowerment.

203
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:39,813
You better not be.

204
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,216
Now, what do we say
to shamers like him?

205
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,318
Shaming is blaming.

206
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,188
Yes, 100% agree!

207
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,494
How could you treat
Grampa like that?

208
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,830
You think you're so smart.
Do you really think

209
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,332
the same thing
wouldn't have happened to you?

210
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,901
Me? Impossible.

211
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,936
I'm too savvy.

212
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,673
This savvy!
See?

213
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:08,742
Dad, anyone can get scammed.
Even me.

214
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,044
I paid the bullies
for wedgie insurance.

215
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,946
But the minute
I got a wedgie, bam!

216
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,548
I got hit with a deductible...
Another wedgie!

217
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,250
And my rates went up.

218
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,420
That's why I never get
any insurance.

219
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,089
I got an email
saying I qualified

220
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,091
for the Saxophone
Junior Olympics,

221
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,960
but when I clicked the link,
they hacked my phone

222
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:30,597
and stole
my Audible listener credits.

223
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,802
You clicked the link?

224
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:38,605
That's so...
Who clicks the link?

225
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:40,808
Even children are being scammed?

226
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:43,610
Well, maybe there's a few more
bad apples than I thought.

227
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:48,048
But I still have to believe
the barrel is mostly good.

228
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,718
Oh, Marge, how I envy
your sweet innocence.

229
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:54,788
The world is a blender full
of sharks set on extra teeth.

230
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,657
So you got to be like me...
Always on guard

231
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,894
- so you're never a sucker.

232
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,296
Delivery for Homer Simpson.

233
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,898
Why'd you buy all these knives?

234
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,735
They're not knives.
They're the future of cutlery.

235
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,436
Put 'em in the garage
with the others.

236
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,502
Others?

237
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,941
- Cutlife is a famous

238
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,309
multi-level marketing company.

239
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,412
Dad, you fell
for a pyramid scheme.

240
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,681
Scheme? No way.

241
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,416
They didn't even
want to let me join.

242
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,419
But, luckily, at the last
minute, a space opened up.

243
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,488
How many knives
have you even sold?

244
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:31,024
I don't sell them.

245
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,692
I engage opportunity handlers

246
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,862
to distributize them for me,

247
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,130
the expandibution manager.

248
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,632
It's all
part of Charles E. Cutlife's

249
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,335
three-dimensional
triangle system.

250
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,171
- Look!
- Why can't Dad

251
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,106
ever get arrested in a suit?

252
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,607
Face it, genius:

253
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,211
you got scammed.

254
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:54,347
She's right. Everyone's right.

255
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,117
Don't look at my gullible face!

256
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:01,021
And so I consign to the flames

257
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,523
a monument to my own stupidity.

258
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:04,657
- No!

259
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,530
Now, isn't there someone
you need to apologize to?

260
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,032
Maybe your father?

261
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,400
Yeah, you're right.

262
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:16,369
I said such horrible things
to him.

263
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:20,707
All that time
I was yelling at you,

264
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,709
it turns out I'm a sucker, too.

265
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,311
Will you forgive me, Dad?

266
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,346
Of course, son.
Hopefully, we've all

267
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,049
come out of this
a little more savvy.

268
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,586
Hello?
Yes, this is a grandparent

269
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,190
of a boy or girl. Sure,
put him or her on the phone.

270
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,827
No!
Lisa's in jail!

271
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,429
Grampa, they're trying
to trick you again.

272
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,331
It's the same swindler.

273
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,566
He must think
I'm greedy for more.

274
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,201
I got an idea.

275
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,505
Grampa, you got to keep talking
so that guy stays on the phone.

276
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,941
Keep talking?

277
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,708
I've been preparing
for this moment

278
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,444
my entire life.

279
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,112
<i>Sir, look, if you don't</i>

280
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,914
<i>put up that bail money,
your granddaughter</i>

281
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:03,083
<i>will be spending the night
in the cooler.</i>

282
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,785
- In my day, we didn't have
fancy coolers,

283
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:09,189
so everyone took turns blowing
on the meat to keep it fresh,

284
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,259
unless you hired a Dutch family
to blow on your food for you.

285
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,395
Breezies is what you'd call 'em.

286
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,770
<i>Sir, if you could just</i>

287
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:26,073
<i>ive us your bank information... g</i>

288
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,608
<i>It was quite the scandal
when a breezy</i>

289
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,578
<i>married a smusher...
Hose were the fellas you hiredt</i>

290
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,047
<i>to flatten your sandwiches
by sitting on 'em...</i>

291
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,150
<i>And the whole town came out
to throw tar...</i>

292
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,987
Wow, that's some
quality prattle.

293
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,955
Okay, I've run all three hours
of the call

294
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,924
through open-source
audio software,

295
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,725
and the unique pattern
of church bells

296
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,662
and roller-coaster screams
pins the location to...

297
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:54,234
ladies and gentlemen,
the address of the scammer.

298
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,304
Whoa, we could
get the money back.

299
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:59,272
It's not about the money.

300
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,975
I want to show that bad guy
the face of the old man

301
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:05,178
whose love and decency
he exploited.

302
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,680
Oh, honey, you have
a beautiful heart.

303
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,082
But make no mistake...

304
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,818
It is about the money!

305
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,971
Kids, today you're gonna
learn an important lesson:

306
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,976
sometimes the sheep
get back their wool.

307
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,645
No, they don't.
They just grow more wool.

308
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,981
What are you, a shepherd?
Come on, Dad.

309
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,950
Let's go get
my eventual money back.

310
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,353
How are we gonna
get past the guard?

311
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:48,321
Aw, don't worry about that.

312
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:51,224
My <i>friends</i> can get us in.

313
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,695
That's the surgical precision
you only get

314
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,897
from the finest Idaho steel.

315
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,867
Amazing.
I'll take the full set.

316
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:02,802
Oh, you're not
buying the knives.

317
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,371
I could sell them?

318
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:07,740
No, you can sell other people
on selling them.

319
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,478
These knives sell
selling themselves themselves.

320
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,181
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime!

321
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:17,684
I'm gonna go tell my pregnant
wife about my new career.

322
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,388
Okay, Grampa,
we're gonna find that bad guy

323
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,723
and get you some justice.

324
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,728
Uh, which one's the scammer?

325
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,897
They're all the scammer.

326
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:33,266
The IRS tax police
are on their way to your home,

327
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:36,069
but we'll accept immediate
payment in <i>Fortnite</i> V-bucks.

328
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,671
Oh, your Airbnb
is all ready to go, there.

329
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,673
I'm fluffing the towels
right now.

330
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,342
Fluff, fluff.

331
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,211
There's so many of them.

332
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:48,048
You are all
in an unethical industry

333
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,417
and we have called
the authorities.

334
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,686
Oh, man.

335
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:56,556
Another boiler room
of phone hucksters.

336
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,858
All right, scambags,
you know the drill:

337
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:02,729
you don't got to go home,
but you can't grift here.

338
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,867
- Come on. - What? - Really?

339
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,571
Aren't you going to arrest them?

340
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,706
Marge, you shut down
one of these,

341
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,775
five more pop up in its place.

342
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,245
Phone fraud and
Halloween costumes for pets

343
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,081
are America's
only growth industries.

344
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:24,151
So they're just employees
doing this for a paycheck?

345
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,286
I wish we got paid in money.

346
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,921
All we get is minimum wage
and gift cards.

347
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:31,124
- Do you have my dad's money?
- No.

348
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,992
- Do you have my money?
- Nope.

349
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,794
Can I have $10,000?

350
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,463
BART' Not gonna happen, dude.

351
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,431
Hey, you sound familiar.

352
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,100
Don't have a cow, man.

353
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:44,003
Is this what
we wanted to happen?

354
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:48,075
Okay, I know this seems bad,
but... but, uh...

355
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:51,678
Oh, come on, Mom, you always
see the good in everything.

356
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:54,414
Well, on the bright side,

357
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:57,117
if you look at it
a certain way...

358
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,851
there is no bright side!

359
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,654
The whole world is one big
criminal organization!

360
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:05,258
From hedge funds to payday loans
to the NCAA,

361
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,094
it's not just a few bad apples...

362
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,629
It's the whole orchard
that's rotten!

363
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,765
Whoa, gift cards!

364
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,301
Justice wasn't served,

365
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,803
but dinner is.

366
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,540
I can't believe we ate

367
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,176
$500 worth of appetizers.

368
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:26,613
Revenge sliders
dipped in payback sauce.

369
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,047
Mmm.

370
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,049
Honey, you're not
sweating from overeating.

371
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,984
What's wrong?

372
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:35,555
These gift cards were obtained
by scamming innocent people.

373
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,490
So no, thank you.

374
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,025
You said it yourself...

375
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:41,661
Everyone in the world
is ripping off everyone else.

376
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,231
Why shouldn't we wet our beaks?

377
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:47,167
Oh, you got to try
these fried beaks.

378
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,736
Dip the beak!
Dip the beak!

379
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,139
Well, it seems like
no one else has a problem

380
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,974
gorging on
ill-gotten appetizers.

381
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,077
Beak me.

382
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,422
With that deep-fried morsel,

383
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:12,559
my victory is complete.

384
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,327
Uh, we're all seeing

385
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:17,330
the freak in the sandals, right?

386
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:20,267
Yes, but this can't be real.

387
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:24,036
We probably just ate too many
wasabi mac and cheese balls.

388
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:25,938
Silence, you mewling wretches,

389
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,542
for I am Loki, god of mischief.

390
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,878
But I am known by many names

391
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,013
and take many forms.

392
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,618
Buy crypto, suckers!

393
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,853
And my handiwork of deception

394
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,056
is woven into the fabric
of the universe.

395
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:46,193
From the Ticketmaster
convenience fee

396
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,795
to the NCAA.

397
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:52,199
Oh, lord of appetizers,
I kneel before you.

398
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,568
Who shall I smother with ranch
in your name?

399
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:59,439
Well, Loki, you've already
taken an old man's life savings.

400
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,140
What more do you want?

401
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,410
I have come here to...

402
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:04,744
'Zerz...

403
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,579
to take my prize:

404
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:09,816
an honest woman's belief
in the good of mankind.

405
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,919
And now, as the old laws demand,

406
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:16,155
I must bestow
upon the vanquished a kiss.

407
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:17,724
Mwah.

408
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,926
Ha-ha!
There are no old laws.

409
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,395
God of mischief does it again!

410
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,631
Now, off to add
more blackout dates

411
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,300
to Disneyland annual passes.

412
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,572
Suckers.

413
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,308
Whoa, that was weird.

414
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,244
Should we get the rest to go?

415
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,180
Excuse me, I'm out of gas

416
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:42,815
and left my wallet at home.

417
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,317
Would you lend me $20?

418
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,419
I'll mail it back to you,
I promise.

419
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,256
Uh, I'm sorry,
but that is an obvious scam.

420
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,090
Uh, go find another sucker.

421
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,526
Is this it... from now on,
I live in a world

422
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:56,496
where nobody trusts anybody?

423
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,298
No, not me.

424
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,967
Here's $20 and my address.

425
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,936
I trust that
you'll mail me the money.

426
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,485
I knew it!

427
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:19,886
Maybe you're right, baby.

428
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:22,555
There still are some
good people out there.

429
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,725
In your face, god of scams!

430
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,566
Well, I'm out another 20 bucks,

431
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,536
but I gave them
something to believe in.

432
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,539
Suckers.

433
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,543
<i>FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY</i>

434
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,545
<i>And FORD.
We go further, so you can.</i>

435
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,387
Your Social Security number
has been compromised.

436
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:55,531
Please give us
your Social Security number

437
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,590
so we can keep it safe.

438
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,494
I met my billionaire boyfriend
on Billionaire Match.

439
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:02,995
Match with billions
of billionaires

440
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:05,365
for only $4.95 a month.

441
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,169
If you or your family have used
toilet paper in the last year,

442
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:13,340
you can join us
in a class action lawsuit.

443
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,209
We have found
nude photos of you.

444
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:19,211
If you want these removed
and/or touched up,

445
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:21,414
please press 1 now.

446
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:25,418
This is Jerry
down at whatever bank you use.

447
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,186
We lost your PIN number.

448
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:29,288
Can you send it to us?

449
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,392
Shh!
