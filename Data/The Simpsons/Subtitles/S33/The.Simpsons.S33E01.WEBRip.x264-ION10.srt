Mmm. When I die,

2
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:12,726
we should totally
get this sandwich place

3
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:13,828
for my memorial.

4
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:16,934
So good. Mmm. Can't wait.

5
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:20,440
Oh, all these people
loved Mr. Chase.

6
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:22,946
His students
are taking it so hard.

7
00:00:23,013 --> 00:00:25,585
Yeah, nobody grieves
like theater kids.

8
00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:32,298
This is my show!

9
00:00:32,364 --> 00:00:35,170
Why are they singing
about computers?

10
00:00:35,237 --> 00:00:37,141
- It was a musical about Y2
- K,

11
00:00:37,207 --> 00:00:39,646
which was very scary back then.

12
00:00:39,713 --> 00:00:42,051
Scarier than anything
we have now.

13
00:00:42,117 --> 00:00:44,556

Mrs. Chase,
I'm so sorry for your loss.

00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:19,325
Oh, thank you, dear.

25
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:21,797

Oh, Franklin always said you
were the heart of the show‐‐

31
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:36,392
that your stage managing
was so... zealous.

32
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:38,798
I definitely ran a tight ship.

33
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:41,402
But in a fun way
everyone loved, obviously.

34
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:43,440
- Oh, yeah, totally.
- Super fun.

35
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:46,547
Of course, I would have loved
to have been in the show,

36
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:48,450
except I'm not much of a singer.

37
00:01:48,517 --> 00:01:52,525
But in my imagination, I've got
the voice of a Disney princess.

38
00:01:52,592 --> 00:01:53,326
Oh...

39
00:01:53,393 --> 00:01:55,297

you filled in for Lenny
