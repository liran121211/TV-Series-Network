180
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,104
(distastefully)
...snot party.

181
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,814
Sir, right away, sir!

182
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,405
They didn't have
any aspirin

183
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,365
so I got you
some cigarettes.

184
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,034
(growls)

185
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,912
Maybe my headache will go away
once the show starts.

186
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,581
(feedback screeching)

187
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,041
Ladies and gentlemen,

188
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,919
what a day for an air show!

189
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,297
Not a cloud in the sky!

190
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,049
Except perhaps...

191
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,593
a mushroom cloud.

192
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,554
(diabolical laughter)

193
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,351
Oops.

194
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,394
(nervous laughter)

195
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,855
Oh, forget it.

196
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:46,025
HAPABLAP:
"To slip the surly bonds of Earth

197
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,236
"and touch the face of God.

198
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,738
To fly"--

199
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:54,075
the dream of man
and flightless bird alike.

200
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,411
And now, hold on tight

201
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,372
as we blast through

202
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,916
the thrilling highlights
of aviation history!

203
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,086
(parade march playing)

204
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,087
Say...

205
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,548
did somebody say box kites?

206
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,549
BART:
No!

207
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,883

208

209
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,012
The common box kite
was originally used

210
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,057
as a means
of drying wet string.

211
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,976

213
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,945

214
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:31,946
Every note is pounding
into my skull.

215
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,407

216
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,826
(whistling)

217
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:43,124
Anybody out there
feel the need for speed?

218
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,251
-ALL: Yay!
-Yay.

219
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,211
Then get ready for the pride

220
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,547
of the United States Air Force:

221
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,842

00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,975
Heh-heh. Why jerk my neck

226
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,644
when tyranno-vision decides
what I should look at.

227
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:07,398
Whoo, look!
It's Maggie!

228
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,900
Uh... Maggie?

00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,113

234
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,205
<i>Television!</i>

235
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,791
<i>Wouldn't our lives</i>

237
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,003
What?

238
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,005
Surely he's not
talking about VH-1?

239
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:34,050
<i>Why, we could revive the lost</i>

00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,434

249
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,489
(clamoring)

250
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,533
<i>By the way, I'm aware</i>

252
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,206
(siren blaring)

253
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,582
Kids, everything's
gonna be okay!

254
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,292
Don't panic!
Just don't panic!

255
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,960
Mom, Mom! You're
stepping on my heels

256
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,712
and knocking my shoes off!

257
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,255
We can always get more shoes.
Move, move, move!

258
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,302
Stamp your hand
for re-entry.

259
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,847
Hey...

260
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,810
Cool. I want to be around when
those guns start going off.

261
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,228
Bart, no!

262
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,856
Wait! Wait, my children
are in there!

263
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,858
You must be
very proud, ma'am.

264
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,989
Our city will not negotiate
with terrorists.

265
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,450
Is there a city nearby
that will?

266
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,535
No need, sir.

267
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,036
We'll find that head case

268
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,038
faster than Garfield
finds lasagna.

269
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,041
Oh... I'm sorry.

270
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,835
My wife thought
that was gangbusters.

271
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,677
This elevator only goes
to the basement,

272
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,139
and someone made
an awful mess down there.

273
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,020
Watch out!
He's got his probe!

274
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,273
(imitating airplane)

275
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,983
(imitating machine gun)

276
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,943
Bart! Bart!

277
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,195
What are you doing?
We've got to get out of here.

278
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,448
Target sighted.
Launching air-to-nerd missile.

279
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,158
Oww! Come on!

280
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,909
Mom and Dad are waiting.

281
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,870
Bob is not here.

282
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:29,039
We have searched
every square inch of this base

283
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,876
and all we have found
is porno, porno, porno!

284
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,421
We have only 20 minutes left.

285
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,923
Send in the esteemed
representatives of television.

286
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,345
Hey, hey!

287
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,681
Now, this is
my kind of meeting.

288
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,894
Gentlemen, it's time we face up
to the un-face-up-to-able.

289
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,520
We must sacrifice television

290
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,690
in order to save the lives
of our townspeople.

291
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,067
Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho!

292
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,944
Let's not go nuts.

293
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:03,157
Would it really be worth living
in a world without television?

294
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,118
I think the survivors
would envy the dead.

295
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:11,123
I appreciate your passion
on behalf of your medium,

296
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,542
but I'm afraid
we're out of options.

297
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,961
Television must go.

298
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,215
May God have mercy
on our souls.

299
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,888
(screaming, cars collide)

300
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,848
<i>And as my final newscast</i>
<i>draws to a close</i>

301
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,350
<i>I'm reminded of a few</i>
<i>of the events</i>

302
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,101
<i>that brought me</i>
<i>closer to you--</i>

303
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,603
<i>The collapse of</i>
<i>the Soviet Union,</i>

304
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,688
<i>premium ice</i>
<i>cream price wars,</i>

305
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,941
<i>dogs that were mistakenly</i>
<i>issued major credit cards,</i>

306
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,984

307
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,821
<i>And so... farewell.</i>

308
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,490
<i>And, uh, don't forget</i>
<i>to look for my...</i>

309
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,408

Success!

314
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,423
They're giving in!

315
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,842
Blast!

316
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,761
I should have
made more demands.

317
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,013
Some decent local marmalade,
for one.

318
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,014
Oh, well. Next time.

319
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,308
Agh! Not my Extendo-Glove!

320
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,185
Oh, they haven't made those
since the war.

321
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,522
Oh! Not my Paris backdrop.

322
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,024
How am I going
to make fun of the frogs?

323
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,819
(sobs)

324
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:25,030
Wait. If I could
only stay on the air,

325
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,324
I'd have a hundred percent
of the audience.

326
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,869
Think of the ratings.

327
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,164
Okay, so we can't
go over the fence.

328
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,791
I feel so helpless.

329
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,626
What if something
happens to them?

330
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,628
I'm sure they're
fine, honey.

331
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,922
Well, at least they're
wearing clean underwear.

332
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,929
Free and easy, Lis.

333
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,056
There's nothing like
an unfurnished basement

334
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,474
for pure comfort.

335
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,518
Huh? Hurry up.

336
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,061
Mom and Dad are
probably worried sick.

337
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,024
You know what really frosts
my Kelvinator?

338
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,818
That fruit cup's probably
still laughing at us

339
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,194
from his damn
hidey hole.

340
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,280
I'd rather take an order
from Bill Clinton

341
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,366
than hear that guy's snooty
high-toned voice again, sir.

342
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,201
High-toned voice.

343
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,329
Bart, that's it.

344
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,122
I know where Sideshow
Bob is hiding.

345
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,584
(panting) When Bob broadcast
that message,

346
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,835
his voice was higher
than normal,

347
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,754
and what makes
your voice high?

348
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,255
Tight binding underwear?

349
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,590
Helium!

350
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,467
Sideshow Bob is
in the Duff blimp.

351
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,305
(constricted voice)
All Springfield trembles

352
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:34,266
before the might
of Sideshow Bob.

353
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,143
Blasted helium.

354
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,436
Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo.

355
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,897
Ah-hah! That's better.

356
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,899
Gone. Gone too.

357
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,318

365
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,961
Krusty? But how?

366
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,755
Coming at you live
from the civil defense shack

367
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:08,467
in the remote alkali flats
of the Springfield badlands.

368
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,637
I'll be beaming out
11 watts of wackiness.

369
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,347
Hour after hour

374
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,197
Oh, my utopia lies in ruins.

375
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,908
How naive of me
to think a mere atom bomb

376
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,953
could fell
the chattering cyclops.

377
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,751
(both gasping)

378
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,170
Well, at least
I'll have my revenge.

Bob, no!

380
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,675
Don't you see? That would
be taking the easy way out?

381
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:50,968
I agree.

382
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,177

00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,159
Damn it, Bob.

385
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,411
There were plenty
of brand-new bombs

386
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,997
but you had to go for
that retro-'50s charm.

387
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,499
(scared gulps)

388
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,460
Well, if it isn't
my arch nemesis

389
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,254
Bart Simpson
and his sister Lisa

390
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,505
to whom I'm fairly indifferent.

391
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,799
So Krusty double-crossed you,

392
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,761
but your basic plan
was pure genius.

393
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,388
Where do you get your ideas?

394
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,890
Oh, please.

395
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,600
Let's not
embarrass us both

396
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,435
with that hoary old
"stall the villain

397
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,478
with flattery" scheme.

398
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,232
I... should have known you
were too smart to fall for that.

399
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,902
Really? What type of smart?
Book smart?

400
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,820
Because there are a lot of
people who are book smart

401
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,822
but it takes a very
special type of genius to...

402
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,199
CHIEF WIGGUM:
<i>All right, Bob, it's over.</i>

403
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,034
Come out with
your hands up.

404
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,827
No!

405
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,370
How did they find me?

406
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,841
(Lisa gasps)

407
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,722
LISA:
He's getting away!

408
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,519
Aw, not the Harrier.

409
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,853
We've got a war
tomorrow.

410
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,189
God bless
the idiot-proof Air Force.

411
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,279
They're gone!

412
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:39,451
HAPABLAP: Hell. Not the
Wright Brothers' plane.

413
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,246
The Smithsonian's gonna
have my ass on a platter.

414
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,625
BART:
Dad!

415
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,794
Help!

416
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,254
Aaah!

417
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,505
Hang on, boy!

418
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,632
Daddy's coming to save you!

419
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,634
D'oh!

420
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,720
Mom, I found
Sideshow Bob's hideout,

421
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,264
and I got a secret message
to the police,

422
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,141
and I had a blimp fall on me,

423
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,934
and I was in an atomic blast,
but I'm okay now.

424
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,645
Well, I wrecked the gate,
but you don't hear me bragging.

425
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:07,938
Now let's roll.

426
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,070
Ah, for the days
when aviation

427
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,488
was a gentleman's
pursuit--

428
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,615
back before
every Joe Sweat Sock

429
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,534
could wedge himself
behind a lunch tray

430
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,703
and jet off
to Raleigh-Durham.

431
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,706
Are you getting lots of bugs
in your mouth, too?

432
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,915
Yes.

433
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,000
(spitting)

434
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,545
<i>Prepare to engage enemy.</i>

435
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,507
<i>Bogie's airspeed not sufficient</i>
<i>for intercept.</i>

436
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,967
<i>Suggest we get out and walk.</i>

437
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,685
Jump, boy! I got ya!

438
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,187
I'm coming!

439
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,438
(both grunt)

440
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,321
Now you, boy!

441
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,823
(gasps)
You can't escape, Bob.

442
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,159
If the tennis rackets don't get you,
the pool skimmers will.

443
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,578
Whoo. I-- I never
planned to escape.

444
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,331
You see, this is
a kamikaze mission.

445
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:11,251
You and I are going
to kill Krusty the Clown!

446
