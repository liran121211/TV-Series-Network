Milhouse, you did

Bart, come with me

00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,691
You, too, snitchy.

40
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,193
Now I want you to clean every
one of these organ pipes

How could you
tell on me?

45
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,752
Well, I didn't want hungry
birds pecking my soul forever.

46
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:54,048
Soul? Come on, Milhouse,
there's no such thing as a soul.

47
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,009
It's just something
they made up to scare kids

48
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,219
like the bogeyman
or Michael Jackson.

49
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,763
But every religion
says there's a soul, Bart.

50
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,223
Why would they lie?

51
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,308
What would
they have to gain?

52
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,353
I don't hear scrubbing.

53
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,522
Well, if your soul's real,
where is it?

54
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,566
It's kind of in here.

55
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:12,984
And when you sneeze

56
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,069
that's your soul
trying to escape.

57
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,572
Saying "God bless you"
crams it back in.

58
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,533
And when you die,
it squirms out and flies away.

59
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,744
Uh-huh. What if you die
in a submarine

60
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:23,786
at the bottom
of the ocean?

61
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,080
Oh, it can swim.

62
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,499
It's even got wheels in case
you die in the desert

63
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,293
and it has to drive
to the cemetery.

64
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,379
How can someone with glasses
that thick be so stupid?

65
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,757
Listen, you don't have a soul,
I don't have a soul.

66
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,551
There's no such thing

67
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,761
Fine.

68
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,138
If you're so sure
about that

69
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,390
why don't you sell
your soul to me?

70
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,808
How much you got?

71
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,435
-Five bucks.
-Deal.

72
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,273

85
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,429

a family restaurant.

86

Oh, it is. It is.

87
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,767

stools up to the pool table.

88
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,312

restaurants these days.

in a dank pit no more.

93
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,533
You ain't thinking of getting
rid of the dank, are you, Moe?

94
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,326
Ah, maybe I am.

95
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,662
But, Moe, the dank, the dank.

96
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,997
Yeah, family restaurants.

97
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,832

the big bucks are.

98
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,502

into a place

to bring your family, huh?

100
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,298
I'm not ashamed.

for you lying in the driveway.

water all over me!

110

(sighs)

111
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,590
I wasted five bucks on these.

112
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,591
Where did you get
five bucks?

113
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,967
I want five bucks.

114
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,761
I sold my soul
to Milhouse.

115
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,472
What? How could you
do that?

116
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,599
Your soul is the most
valuable part of you.

117
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,559
You believe in
that junk?

118
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,979
Well, whether or not the soul
is physically real, Bart,

119
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,815
it's the symbol of everything
fine inside us.

120
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,276
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Poor, gullible Lisa.

121
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,487
I'll keep my
crappy sponges, thanks.

122
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,490
Bart, your soul is the only
part of you that lasts forever.

123
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,949
For five dollars,

124
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,410
Milhouse could own you
for a zillion years.

125
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,329
Well, if you think
he got such a good deal,

126
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,581
I'll sell you my
conscience for 4.50.

127
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,458
I'll throw in my sense
of decency too.

128
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,378

00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,294
Well?

179
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,588
Nope. I don't
feel a thing.

180
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,798
That's creepy,
Bart.

181
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,259
I think you really did
lose your soul.

182
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,219
-Good boy. Ow!
-(growling)

183
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,470
Who's doin' that?

184
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,638
Hmm?

185
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,057
Nothing.

186
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,267
Ow! Help me! Ow!

187
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,477
Why isn't anybody--
Ow! Helping?

188
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,357
-(doorbell rings)
-Hi, is Milhouse home?

189
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,359
He's playing in the dirt
with his Army men.

190
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,736
Oh, and a white
piece of paper, I believe.

191
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,779
(gasps)

192
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,824
Cover me, Sarge.

193
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,158
I'm going after Bart's soul.

194
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,160
(imitating gun fire)

195
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,914
If the Ayatollah can't
have it, no one can.

196
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,874
(imitating engine)

197
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,042
Uh, uh, you know, Milhouse...

198
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,502
(smugly)
Yes?

199
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,546
Bet you're getting tired
of that soul, huh?

200
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,089
No.

201
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,925
Well, suppose someone
wanted to buy it from you?

202
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,344
Ohh. You want
to buy it back, Bart?

203
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,930
Sure. No problem.

204
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,974
-50 bucks.
-What?!

205
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,976
Who's stupid now? Huh?

206
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,020
(maniacal laughing)

207
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,820

Bart, what's wrong?

226
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,824
There's something
a little off

227
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,117
about your hug.

228
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,119
Mom, I need to tell
you something.

229
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,579
I kind of--

Uh, uh, uh.
Let me guess.

231
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,375
A mother can always tell.

232
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,376
Mm-hmm.

00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,627
Hmm.

234
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,379

00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,381
Mm-hmm.

236
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,133
It's not swim test anxiety.

00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,261
It almost feels like
you're missing something--

238
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,429
something important.

239
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,597

Wait. Wait for me!

257
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,622
(singsongy) Bart, it's time
to end this dream,

258
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,333
and don't forget
the standard scream.

259
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,210
(screaming)

260
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,343
An alligator with sunglasses?

261
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,179
Now I've seen everything.

262
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,598
Hiya, folks.
Welcome to Uncle Moe's.

263
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,726
Ah, look at all
the cute little minors.

264
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,771
Wow. That's Moe.
The guy from the ad.

265
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,230
Right this way, Homer.

266
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,232
And he knows my name.

267
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,778
Street signs indoors?

268
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,404
(giggles)
Whatever.

269
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,406
Now Rod, you order
anything you want

270
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,241
for your big ten-o.

271
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,243
Million Dollar Birthday Fries.

272
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,037
Uh-oh.

273
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,997
Moe gets so excited
when you order

274
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,832
his Million Dollar
Birthday Fries

275
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,126
he just has to celebrate.

276
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,128
Here you go.
Here I am, Uncle Moe.

277
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,129
Thank you, ma'am.

278
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,297
This'll be a treat.

279
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,716
Uncle Moe,
here I am, while you eat.

280
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,889
Please take the fries
off my head, kid.

281
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,766
The basket is extremely hot.

282
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,352
How are the southwestern
pizza fingers?

283
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,853
They're, um...

284
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,647
"awesomely outrageous."

285
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,981
Oh, these look good.

286
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,775
Guilt-free
steak fish filets.

287
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,485
No, no, let me level
with you, Marge.

288
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,611
That's just our name

289
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,904
for bottom-feeding
suction eel.

290
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,405
You don't want that.

291
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,325
Why don't you try
Moe's Hobo Chicken Chili?

292
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,953
I start with the best part,
the neck,

293
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,455
and then I add
secret hobo spices.

294
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,415
Ooh, <i>tres bien.</i>

295
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,583
Yeah.

296
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,544
(giggles)

297
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,712
What the hell are you doing,
you little freak?!

298
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,006
(crying)

299
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,550
Oh, sorry, kid.
Sorry.

300
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,926
I'm not used to the
laughter of children.

301
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,970
It cuts through me
like a dentist's drill.

302
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,055
But no, no, that was funny,
that was funny

303
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,640
taking away my dignity
like that.

304
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,641
Ha, ha, ha.

305
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,226
I would like
to say grace.

306
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,019
(clears throat)

307
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,230
Lord, have mercy
on my soul

308
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,731
and Mom's soul

309
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,567
and Dad's soul

310
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,068
and Maggie's soul

311
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,988
and that every soul
in Christendom-- Uh!

312
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,197
Bart!

313
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,490
I can't take
this anymore.

314
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,534
I want my soul,
and I want it now.

315
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,829
Bart, you didn't finish
your spaghetti and Moe Balls.

316
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,163
<i>HOMER'S BRAIN:</i>
<i>Silence, you fool.</i>

317
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,290
<i>It can be ours.</i>

318
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,625
Run, boy!

319
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,085
Run.

320
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:42,172
(chewing)
Run for your life... boy.

321
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,262
Milhouse! Milhouse.
You win!

322
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,680
I want this nightmare to end!

323
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,057
(creaking)

324
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,434
(deep breathing)

325
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,104
(sinister voice)
Leave this place.

326
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,732
You are in great danger.

327
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,775
Where's Milhouse?

328
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,570
The one you call
Milhouse is gone.

329
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,657
(normal voice) He went to his
grandma's place

330
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,825
while we're spraying
for potato bugs.

331
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,621
Oh. When Milhouse left

332
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,706
did you notice if he was
carrying a piece of paper?

333
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,042
Oh, yeah. You don't forget
a thing like that.

334
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,003
(alarm sounding)

335
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,004
Oh, God.

336
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,382
Here you go!

337
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,551
Here I am, Uncle Moe!
Thank you, ma'am.

338
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,845
This will be a treat.
Uncle Moe! Here I am!

339
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,263
-While you eat!
-Yay!

340
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,765
Now do it
for Terri.

341
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,099
What? It's your
birthday too?

342
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,809
BOTH: We're twins.

343
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:36,894
(sighs)

344
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,312
Here you go.
Here I am.

345
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,064
Eat your fries.
Eat them.

346
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,732
Here's you.

347
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:45,069
Ah, geez. And you got
the stink lines and everything.

348
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,574
Oh, dude,
you did not smile.

349
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,992
We eat for free.

350
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,661
Come on, Shoshanna,
let's roll.

351
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,995
(chuckles)

352
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,580
But I sang you
the potato stuffings.

353
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,375
Come on, I sang you
the potato stuffings!

354
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,293
Look at the vein
on that guy's forehead.

355
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,544
He's gonna blow.

356
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,130
(alarm sounding)

357
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,049
Unky Moe?

358
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,551
What... is it,
sweetheart?

359
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,970
My "sodie" is too cold.

360
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,471
My "teef" hurt.

361
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,848
Your "teef" hurt, huh?
Your "teef" hurt?

362
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,058
Well, that's
too freaking bad!

363
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,393
Ya hear me?
I'll tell you

364
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,269
where you can put your
freaking "sodie" too!

365
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,730
(all gasping)

366
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,358
-Ow! My freaking ears!
-(gasps)

367
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,943
Oh, let's go, dear.

368
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,403
I expect that type
of language at Denny's

369
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,362
but not here.

370
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,156
Come on, folks, wait!

371
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,408
Please, come back!

372
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,951
Please, I got a new
offer.

373
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,786
Whenever Uncle Moe threatens you

374
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,746
you get a free
steak... fish.

375
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,747
(sighs)

376
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,168
Okay. Okay.

377
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,713
Milhouse's grandmother
lives on 257th Street

378
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,464
and I'm on Third.

379
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,590
(groans)

380
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,633
(horn blaring)

381
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,639
(pop!)

382
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,641
Well finally, a little luck.

383
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,600
(squeaking)

384
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,479
(evil laugh)

385
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,358
(crashing)

386
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,285
(yelling gibberish)

387
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,911
Son, you wait here
while Daddy tries

388
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,955
to talk some sense into
this raving derelict.

389
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:25,002
(gibberish)

390
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,128
Now slow down,
slow down.

391
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,258
Who's been stealing
your thoughts?

392
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,683
-Hello, Ralph. 
-(gasps)

393
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,769
Um, hi, Bart.

394
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,562
I know you from school.

395
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,897
Yes.

396
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,024
A simple proposition, Ralph:

397
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,650
how would you like
to make a dollar?

398
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,487
Uh... I don't know.

399
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,738
All you have to do
is sign a paper

400
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,990
that says I can
have your soul.

401
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,283
I need a soul, Ralph.

402
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,701
Any soul.

403
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,702
Yours.

404
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,621
(whimpers)

405
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,955
(crying)

406
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,707
Hey, what's going on
over there?

407
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,958
(hissing)

408
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,961
(pounding on wood)

409
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,049
Go on, take it all.
Get it all out of here.

410
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,133
You know, Moe,
you might want

411
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,094
to keep the fire
extinguishers.

412
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,720
Nah. Too many
bad memories.

413
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,430
Well, look on the
bright side, Moe.

414
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,265
You still got us.

415
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,393
Yeah. You know, that actually
makes me feel a little better.

416
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,895
HOMER: Why?

417
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,522
That was the problem
in the first place.

418
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,898
You were going broke

419
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,566
because we were
your only customers.

420
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,777
Wasn't that the problem
in the first place?

421
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,904
That you were
going broke?

422
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,739
Moe? Moe?

423
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,241
Hey, Moe?

424
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,992
Oh, you're thinking
about all the money

425
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,285
you blew, aren't you?

426
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,747
What was it,
$50,000, $60,000?

427
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,332
Moe? Look,

428
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,917
maybe it would help
if you went over

429
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,585
all the mistakes you made
from the beginning.

430
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,628
-Moe?
-What?!

431
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,629
Let me get a pad.

432
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,092
(snoring)

433
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,593
(knocking on door)

434
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,595
A caller at this hour?

435
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,347
You dial 9-1,

436
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,767
then when I say so,
dial 1 again.

437
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,352
(panting)

438
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,478
Milhouse, please.

439
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,522
Bart, I can't play now.

440
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,190
It's 2:00 A.M.

441
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,234
Milhouse, I got to
have my soul back.

442
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,694
I'll do
anything you want.

443
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,904
Uh... well...

444
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,406
Milhouse,
give him back his soul.

445
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,532
I've got work tomorrow.

446
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,117
I'm really sorry.

447
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,869
I kinda traded
your soul to the guy

448
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,453
at the comic book store.

449
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,789
But look, I got
some cool Pogs.

450
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,499
Alf Pogs.

451
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,959
Remember Alf?

452
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,128
He's back,
in Pog form.

453
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,422
You traded my soul
for Pogs?!

454
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,757
No-o-o-o!

455
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,426
GRANDMOTHER:
Close that door.

456
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,719
You're letting
the heat out.

457
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,637
FATHER:
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

458
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,687
If you're waiting for
the "Hi & Lois" signing

459
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,647
it has been moved
to the Springfield Coliseum.

460
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,399
Please, you have
something of mine

461
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,692
on a little piece of paper.

462
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,653
Oh. So you're Bart Simpson, eh?

463
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,322
Well,
since my breakfast burrito

464
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,656
is congealing rapidly,

465
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,657
I will be blunt.

466
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,658
You're too late.

467
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,327
I sold your soul
last night.

468
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,748
Yes, yes, I found a buyer
right away for that item.

469
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,041
Who?

470
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,834
I'm not at liberty
to divulge the party

471
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,669
but they were most interested
in having possession

472
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,795
of a little boy's soul.

473
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,174
Excuse me.

474
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,426
No banging your head
on the display case, please.

475
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,637
It contains
a very rare "Mary Worth"

476
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,721
in which she has
advised a friend

477
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,556
to commit suicide.
Thank you.

478
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,360
Are you there, God?

479
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,863
It's me, Bart Simpson.

480
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,074
I know I never paid too much
attention in church

481
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:46,036
but I could really use
some of that good stuff now.

482
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,621
I'm afraid.

483
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,706
I'm afraid
some weirdo's got my soul

484
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,417
and I don't know
what they're doing to it.

485
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,919
I just want it back.

486
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,422
Please.

487
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,049
(sobbing)

488
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,050
(whimpers)

489
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,594
I hope you can hear this.

490
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,769
Lisa? You bought this?

491
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,562
With the change
in my piggy bank.

492
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,481
There's no change
in your piggy bank.

493
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,899
Not in any of the ones
you know about.

494
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,777
Oh, Lis, thank you.

495
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,320
Happy to do it.

496
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,364
But you know Bart,
some philosophers

497
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,825
believe that nobody
is born with a soul,

498
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:25,867
that you have to earn one

499
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,910
through suffering

500
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,453
and thought
and prayer

501
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,247
like you did
last night.

502
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,498
Uh-huh.

503
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,708

504
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,593
Ha! It's like punting on the
Thames. Stroke. Stroke.

505
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,389
Oh!

00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,433
