43
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,872
No, it's no use.

45
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,627

they canceled my jazz program

57

got fired...

shoot someone.

-Could not.

-Sure!
-He's a good suspect.

67
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,751

Yeah! Smingers did it.

77
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,143
A gun...

78
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,312
And it's been recently fired.

79
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,190

Us hotheads here

87

97
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,668

98
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,878

99
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,008
Father, I'm not
a Catholic but--

100
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,220
Well, I tried to march in
the St. Patrick's Day parade.

101
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:27,058
Anyway, I've got
a rather large sin to confess.

102
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,354
(sniffles)
I'm the one who--

103
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,148
who shot Mr. Burns.

104
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,358
That's all I
needed to hear.

105
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,443
Boy, this thing
works great.

106
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,153
The man became
consumed by greed.

107
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,947
He'd steal from anyone.

108
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,199
This isn't a rival company
you're battling with.

109
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,368
It's a school.
People won't stand for it.

110
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,786
Pish-posh.

111
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,247
It will be like taking
candy from a baby.

112
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,166
Say, that sounds like a larf.

113
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,752
And when he tried
to steal our sunlight,

114
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:58,339
he crossed that line between
everyday villainy

115
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,549
and cartoonish super-villainy.

116
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,134
Bah!

117
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:06,639

129
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,788

she missed Tailhook.

131
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,001

132
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,087
Hey, that's my Madonna gag.
That guy stole my gag.

133
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,797
And you stole it

134
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,175
from last Friday's episode
of "Pardon My Zinger."

135
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,595
Stole, made up-- What's the difference?
(nervous chuckle)

136
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,348
Mr. Smithers must have
seen that program too.

137
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,725
He never misses it.

138
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,602
At the town meeting,
he mentioned

139
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,312
that he watched
Comedy Central.

140
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:58,483
I made sure to note that,
as it seemed quite unusual.

141
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,692
Ye gods!

142
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,444
To the police station,
Krusty.

143
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,905
I am Melvin Van Horn

144
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,240
and this is my associate,
Hershel Krustofsky.

145
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,742
Hey, hey.

146
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,536
Officers, you have arrested
an innocent man.

147
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,038
Really? Oh, geez.

148
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,207
All right Colossos,
you're free to go,

149
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,750
but stay away
from death mountain.

150
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,044
But all my stuff is there.

151
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,420
(clearing throat)

152
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,881
I was referring
to Wayland Smithers.

153
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,509
Mr. Burns was shot
Friday at 3:00 p.m.

154
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,344
The very time that Smithers
was at home

155
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,346
watching "Pardon My Zinger."

156
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,515
So you see,
he couldn't have done it.

157
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,100
Yes...

158
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,518
You're right. I remember now.

159
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,479
I--I watched that entire show.
In fact...

160
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:40,274
I left the town meeting early,
so I could get home in time.

161
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,277
SMITHERS (slurring):
I got to run or I'll miss

162
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,570
the opening rank-out.

163
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,365
Get out of my way, please.

164
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,367
Slow down. The sidewalk's
for regular walking,

165
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,202
not for fancy walking.

166
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,830
SMITHERS: Out of my way.
I'm in a hurry.

167
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,040
You simmer down,
I'll let you go.

168
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,292
(gunfire)

169
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,003
So, instead of wounding
an evil old man

170
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,548
I may have killed
an innocent old man.

171
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,508
That's much worse.

172
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,553
About 50,000 volts worse,
if you know what I mean.

173
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,887
(grunting)

174
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,264
Sizzle!

175
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,267
Wait a minute. If a second
old geezer got shot,

176
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,227
how come nobody reported it?

177
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,564
(knocking)

178
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,149
Uh, hi.

179
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,026
Um, could we take
a look at your leg?

180
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,780
Yeah, that's real spruce.

181
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,948
You like it?

182
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,658
Whew, thank God.

183
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,078
Sir, I only hope
you can forgive me

184
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,788
for shooting
your wooden leg.

185
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,957
You shot who
in the what, now?

186
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,917
Okay, Smithers,
you're free to go.

187
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,794
And you, one question.

188
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,713
Do you know who shot Mr. Burns?

189
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,549
'Cause we are really
up the creek on this one.

190
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,636
<i>And with the</i>
<i>prime suspect cleared</i>

191
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,762
<i>and found</i>
<i>completely innocent,</i>

192
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,681
<i>we must now ask ourselves</i>

193
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,725
<i>who could possibly</i>
<i>be as bloodthirsty</i>

194
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,351
<i>as Wayland Smithers?</i>

195
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,021
I guess it's never
the most likely suspect.

196
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,607
Actually, Mom,
in 95% of cases it is.

197
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,984
The rest of the time,
it's usually

198
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,111
some deranged lunatic
who did it for no reason.

199
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,155
Hey, I had
a damn good reason.

200
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,408
He could never remember my name.

201
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,993
Who the devil are you?

202
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,036
(grunting)

203
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,579
(screaming)

204
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,331
Homer Simpson!

205
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,416
My name is Homer Simpson!

206
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,876
Well, I don't think
anyone in this family

207
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,628
is capable of
attempted murder.

208
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:28,090
Eh, you never know
what you're capable of.

209
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,927
I never thought I could
shoot down a German plane,

210
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,305
but last year
I proved myself wrong.

211
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,224
Nancy Drew says that all you
need to solve a mystery

212
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,434
is an inquisitive temperament
and two good friends,

213
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,561
and I've got an
inquisitive temperament.

214
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,771
Maybe I could help solve this.

215
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,356
(groans)

216
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,857
I think you're
a little young

217
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,609
to be investigating
an attempted murder.

218
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,070
Why don't you try
to solve the mystery

219
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,197
of who put that mud
in the freezer?

220
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,449
Who wants chocolate ice cream?

221
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,450
Me, me, me, me!

222
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,163
Okay, boys, we've got a clue.

223
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,999
The bullet they
took out of Burns.

224
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:06,546
Now, let's discuss
the uh... mo-tive.

225
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,756
LISA: Mr. Burns is the
richest man in town.

226
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,924
Maybe it's about money.

227
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,217
That's some good
thinking, Lou.

228
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,260
Hey, thanks, Chief.

229
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,302
LISA: Hey, I said that!

230
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,971
My name is Lisa Simpson,

231
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,515
and I made a chart of all
the suspects in the Burns case.

232
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:21,310
Look. Mr. Burns hurt
all these people financially.

233
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,187
<i>Nightclub owner Moe Szyslak.</i>

234
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,773
<i>His bar was closed because</i>
<i>of Burns's negligence.</i>

235
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,858
<i>Liquor connoisseur</i>
<i>Barney Gumble.</i>

236
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,278
<i>When Moe's closed Barney lost</i>
<i>his only means of support:</i>

237
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,905
<i>Sucking coins out of</i>
<i>the love tester machine.</i>

238
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,782
That's a real good way
to get sick.

239
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,243
<i>LISA: Dedicated educator</i>
<i>Principal Seymour Skinner.</i>

240
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,619
<i>His school lost millions</i>

241
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,913
<i>when Burns pirated its</i>
<i>oil well.</i>

242
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,082
<i>And grounds tender</i>
<i>Groundskeeper Willy.</i>

243
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,626
<i>He lost his job</i>
<i>and his dream of owning</i>

244
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,086
<i>a fine crystal slop bucket.</i>

245
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,963
And what about that jazz teacher
that got laid off,

246
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:52,508
you know, uh, Mr. Samba,
Señor Mambo-- What was it?

247
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,843
-Tito Puente?
-Yeah.

248
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,636
Well, he did vow revenge.
(chuckles)

249
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,307
But I can't see him
doing something illegal.

250
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,350
He's in show business,
he's a celebrity.

251
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,893
Let's roll, boys.

252
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,895
(police siren blares)

253
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,940
Revenge? Of course--

254
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,817
But why wound
his body with bullets

255
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,070
when I could set his soul afire
with a slanderous mambo?

256
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,823
Listen, if you will,
to my revenge.

257
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,033

Let me...

286
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,194
Let me think.

287
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,320
Oh.

288
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,321
Now I did...

289
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,781
I did go to the town meeting

290
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,283
with the intention
of ambushing Mr. Burns.

291
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,079
When it adjourned, I rushed
to the lavatory to apply

292
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,248
my camouflage makeup.

293
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,167
Blast! I took mother's
makeup kit by mistake.

294
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,211
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.

295
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,754
Superintendent Chalmers!

296
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,840
Oh, my God!

00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,842
(distant gunshot)

298
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,553
So Superintendent Chalmers
can vouch for your whereabouts?

299
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,514
Oh, yes, but anything else
he tells you is a filthy lie.

300
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:07,143
I'm telling ye,
I could nay have shot Burns.

-(groans)
-(gun cocks)

302
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,022
This is your last warning
about that.

303
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,984
It's impossible for me
to fire a pistol.

304
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,194
If you'll check
my medical records

305
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,822
you'll see I have
a crippling arthritis

307
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,908
Look at them.

308
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,370
I got it from Space Invaders
in 1977.

309
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,330
Yeah, that was a pretty
addictive video game.

310
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,874
Video game?

311
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,208
Do you hold a grudge
against Montgomery Burns?

312
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,626
-No.
-(buzzes)

313
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,754
Alright, maybe I did
but I didn't shoot him.

315
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,631

you're free to go.

316

a hot date tonight.

All right!

323
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,391
I'm gonna sit at home
and ogle the ladies

324

Would you unhook this
already, please?!

328
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,358

your cigar box

331
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,030
dug up in the back yard,
but the gun wasn't there.

332
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,615
Have you seen it?

333
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,284
You accuse me of everything
around here.

337

I was just asking
if you'd seen it.

00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,629
There's no need
to be a prickly pear.

Oh, you're
the bee's knees, baby.

340
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,593
I missed you bad.

341

to me, Grandpa?

342
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,889
Um... Yes.

00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,767
We're still not close.

Boy! This is gonna be
an all-night brainbuster.

346
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,523
Yep, better drink some coffee.

347
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,567
Oh, we're out of coffee.

348
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,612

this warm cream.

00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:25,406
(normal voice)
Look at Burns's suit! Yeesh!

356
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,907
Huh?!

357
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,492
I had an idea, Chief.

358
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,952
Why don't we
check out that suit

359
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,579
Burns was wearing
when he got shot?

360
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,247
Did you have the same
backwards-talking dream

361
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,707
with the flaming cards?

362
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,708
I'll drive.

363
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,046
Eureka!

364
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,967
Ooh, nice eyelash. Yours?

365
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,136
No. We need to find out
who it belonged to.

366
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,304
We want a DNA test.

367
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,471
Ooh-ooh-ee-ooh-oh.

368
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,849
That takes eight
to ten weeks.

369
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,642
(sighs)

370
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,185
Did I say weeks?

371
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,186
'Cause I meant seconds.

372
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,941
What do you got, the whole
town's DNA on file?

373
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,818
Uh-huh. If you've
ever handled a penny,

374
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,528
the government's
got your DNA.

375
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,113
Why do you think
they keep 'em in circulation?

376
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,489
Scan's finished.

377
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,450
Now it's going
to narrow it down

378
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,910
to the family bloodline.

379
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,536
♪♪ (fanfare)

380
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,163
(shuddering)

381
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,289
Homer Simpson!

382
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,373
Bingo.

383
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,751
Our gunman
has a name-o.

384
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,294
-Chief, Chief!
-Chief.

385
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,087

387
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,301
Hey, Chief Wiggum
what are you doing?

388
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,345
What's going on?

389
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,222
I'm sorry, kid. We got
Simpson DNA on Burns's clothing

390
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,892
and your father was identified by
the old man himself.

391
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,018
(all gasp)

392
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,395
DNA, positive I.D.

393
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,396
Those won't hold up
in any court.

394
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,398
-Run, Dad!
-Hey ho.

395
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,943
Look what I found
under Mr. Simpson's car seat.

396
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,447
I swear! I've never
seen that gun before.

397
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,990
Then why are your fingerprints
all over it, sir?

398
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:50,991
(yelps)

399
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,248
This bullet matches the one
we took out of Burns.

400
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,376
Homer Simpson,
you're under arrest

401
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,543
for attempted murder.

402
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,878
D'oh!

403
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,672
Yeah, that's what
they all say--

404
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,215
They all say "D'oh."

405
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,848
WIGGUM: Yeah,
we need two cups of coffee,

406
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,850
and two orders of bite-sized
breakfast pancakes

407
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,644
with extra dipping sauce.

408
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,939
<i>MAN: Please pull up to</i>
<i>the service window, please.</i>

409
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,191
The wagon's too tall.

410
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,859
I don't want
to have to get out.

411
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,736
I'll just drive up
on the curb.

412
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,782
(grunting)

413
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:32,783
Blug.

414
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,451
Almost got it.

415
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,494
Drop the food,
Chief.

416
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,954

00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,622

00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,748
Dang fools.

419
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,874
Drive-through's not for parking.

420
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,837
(yells)

421
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,677
Diane, I'm going
to take my break now.

422
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,930
Hi, everybody.

423
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,890
Ho! Mer... Simp... Son.

424
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,143
Okay, that was
a little strange.

425
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,436
Um...

426
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,062
Tell me, how are
you feeling today?

427
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,480
Homer.

428
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,481
Simpson Homer.

429
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,442
D-oh... Simpson!

430
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,945
Hmm. That seems to be
all you can say.

431
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,739
When you were
in that coma,

432
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,116
did you feel your brain
getting damaged?

433
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,785
The police have such
a strong case against Homer.

434
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,120
Mr. Burns said
he did it.

435
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,288
They have Homer's DNA--

436
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,081
They have Simpson DNA.

437
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,666
It could have come
from any of us.

438
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,418
Except you,
since you're a Bouvier.

439
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,879
No, no, no, when I took
your father's name

440
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,715
I took everything that came with it,
including DNA.

441
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,133
Okay, Mom.

442
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,801
Anyway, my point is

443
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,345
the evidence isn't
as concrete as it seems.

444
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,930
Like those fingerprints.

445
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,724
They could have gotten
on the gun some other way.

446
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,435
Are you sure you don't
want me to hold

447
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,811
one of your ice cream cones?

448
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,688
Yeah, right.

449
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,024
You chose fruit.
You live with fruit.

450
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,067
D'oh!

451
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,068
Oh...

452
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,153
No... No... No.

453
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,739
Ew! Why is this
on the floor?

454
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,243
And we don't even know
whose gun that was.

455
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,914
Maybe somebody planted
it there to frame Dad.

456
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,707
No, we can't start
thinking that way

457
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,209
about our own
family members.

458
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,795
Suspicion could
tear us apart.

459
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,546
That's right.

460
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,215
We all got
to stick together

461
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,509
if we're gonna have
any hope of bringing

462
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,302
that awful Homer
to justice.

463
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,099
Here is a photo of
the fugitive from our files.

464
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,892
And now, Wayland Smithers,

465
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,769
who's been a real good sport

466
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:24,895
about that
wrongful arrest thing...

467
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,396
(whistles)

468
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,023
Has a statement
that he would like to make.

469
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,109
-Wayland?
-Thank you.

470
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,860
As Montgomery Burns's
closest friend,

471
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,445
I'm certain that there
is nothing he'd want more

472
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,949
than swift, brutal revenge
against Homer Simpson.

473
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,993
Therefore, I am offering
a $50,000 reward

474
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,621
for his capture...
Dead or alive.

475
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,123
Holy cow!
Me first! Me first!

476
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,750
Homer Simpson?

477
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,920
So, you finally
learned my name, eh?

478
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,464
Homer Simpson.

479
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,550
I've got no time for your
demented parlor games.

480
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,887
You won't be telling anyone else
that Homer Simpson shot you.

481
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,309
The scene of the crime.

482
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,770
There must be something here
that can clear Dad.

483
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,897
(cooing)
Clue, clue.

484
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,066
That's it! Oh, Mr. Pigeon!

485
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,027
I'd kiss you if you
weren't swimming with disease.

486
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,615
(church bell tolls)

487
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,749
(gasps)
So the DNA was right.

488
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,711
It must have been...
Oh, Dad!

489
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,754
<i>MAN: Attention all units:</i>
<i>Homer Simpson has been sighted.</i>

490
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,923

493
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,262
Be careful when we capture him.

494
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,555
We cannot claim the reward

495
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,473
unless we have 51%
of the carcass.

496
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,691
Stop!

497
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,527
Don't shoot my dad!

498
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,862
He's innocent.

499
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,865
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

500
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,075
-Stop telling them it was me!
-Homer Simpson.

501
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,952
I'll kill you
for saying it was me.

502
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,704
Ho-mer Simp-son.

503
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,165
BURNS: What is the
m-meaning of this?

504
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:11,210
Smithers, who is this
beast that's shaking me?

505
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,337
D'oh!

506
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,923
Say it, Burns!

507
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,425
Say I never shot you!

508
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,426
Before...

509
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,303
Shot? (chuckles)
By you?

510
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,680
I'm afraid not,
my primitive friend.

511
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,016
Your kind has neither
the cranial capacity

512
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,560
nor the opposable digits
to operate a firearm.

513
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,229
The one who shot me was...

514
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,149
(yelling)

515
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,859
M--Maggie Simpson!

516
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,073
With the sunblocker in place
and the town aghast,

517
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,116
I was on top of the world.

518
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,160
<i>So, I wanted to kick</i>
<i>up my heels</i>

519
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,787
<i>and indulge</i>
<i>my sweet tooth.</i>

520
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,622
I feel like celebrating.

521
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,086
Oh, it's you. What are you
so happy about?

522
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,296
(gasps)
I see.

523
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,758
Yes...

524
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,009
(lips smacking)

525
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,594
That's the one.

526
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,429
Smithers had thwarted
my earlier attempt

527
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,889
to take candy from a baby,

528
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,100
but with him out
of the picture,

529
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,227
I was free to wallow
in my own crapulence.

530
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,312
I think you better drop it.

531
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,147
<i>But the old axiom</i>
<i>was misleading;</i>

532
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,775
<i>taking the candy proved</i>
<i>exceedingly difficult.</i>

533
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,652
I said, drop it!

534
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,946
(straining)

535
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,950
(gunfire)

536
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,833
<i>Stricken, I lurched forth</i>
<i>in search of aid</i>

537
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,752
<i>but finding only</i>
<i>slack-jawed gawkers</i>

538
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,921
<i>I gave up and collapsed</i>
<i>on the sundial.</i>

539
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,424
Then with your last
ounce of strength

540
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,510
you pointed
to "W" And "S"

541
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:47,264
Or, from your point
of view, "M" And "S."

542
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,807
Maggie Simpson.

543
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,100
What?

544
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,144
No, with my last ounce
of strength

545
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,022
I sucked out my gold fillings
and swallowed them.

546
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,190
Those paramedics
have sticky fingers.

547
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,318
Well, I'm just relieved
that Homer's safe

548
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,820
and that you've recovered,
and we can all get back to normal.

549
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,405
If Maggie could talk

550
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,865
I'm sure she'd apologize
for shooting you.

551
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,242
I'm afraid
that's insufficient.

552
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,202
Officer, arrest the baby.

553
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,080
(laughing)
Yeah, right, Pops.

554
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,250
No jury in the world's
gonna convict a baby.

555
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,418
Hmm, maybe Texas.

556
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,420
Besides, she didn't mean it.

557
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,588
It was an accident.

558
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,718

00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,934

00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,349
