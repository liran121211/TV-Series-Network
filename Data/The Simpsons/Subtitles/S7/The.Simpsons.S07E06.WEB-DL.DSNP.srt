6
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,490
Ah, the Miracle Mile.

7
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,826
Where value wears
a neon sombrero,

8
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,871
and there's not a single church
or library to offend the eye.

9
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,914
There it is!

10
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,167
The chain that put the "fat"

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,918
in "fat Southern sheriffs."

12
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,962
I want a colossal donut

13
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,423
just like the one
on the sign.

14
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,050
D'oh! Nuts.

15
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,468
That's false advertising.

16
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,511
Sorry, sir.
No refunds.

17
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,347
I paid for a colossal donut,

18
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:00,560
and I'm going
to get a colossal donut.

19
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,812
-You don't scare us.
-(thunderclap)

20
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,190

21
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,150

26
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,455
(snorting)
Eggheads.

27
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,539
What do they know?

28
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,635
-(metal scraping)
-Hee hee hee!

29
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,553
I got your donut, Lard Lad!

30
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,806
And what are you going
to do about it?

31
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,349

(Marge grunting)

36
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,410
Homer, where
did you get that?

37
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,578
Get what?

38
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,080
That giant donut.

39
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,083
Well, I acquired it legally,
you can be sure of that.

40
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,088
(cheering)

41
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,465
Dude, you're huge!

42
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,051
Yeah, let's party, baby.

43
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,052

00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:22,851

00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,310
Fellas!

46
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,812
Where are you going
at this hour?

47
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,148
Hey! Don't scratch up
them heads!

48
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,192
<i>Good morning, everybody.</i>
<i>Panic is gripping Springfield,</i>

49
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,320
<i>as giant advertising mascots</i>
<i>rampage through the city.</i>

50
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,865
<i>Perhaps it's part of some</i>
<i>daring new ad campaign,</i>

51
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,033
<i>but what new product</i>
<i>could justify such carnage?</i>

52
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,869
<i>A cleanser?</i>

53
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,412
<i>A fat-free fudge cake</i>

58
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,550
Whoa. Another acid flashback.

59
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,886
Man, I'd hate to be driving
a bus right now.

60
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,684
-(screaming)
-(gulps)

61
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,651
Aw, they're not
so tough.

62
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,278
Uh, Chief, that
wasn't a monster.

63
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,571
That was the captain

64
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,822
of the high school
basketball team.

65
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,324
Uh, yeah...

66
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,242
well, he was turning
into a monster, though.

67
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,370
BART:
What are you waiting for?

68
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,455
Wreck the school.

69
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,789
You know you wanna.

70
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,082
-Hmm.
-I agree.

71
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,127
-Destroy the school.
-Hmm.

72
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,337
(shouts)

73
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,214
(doorbell rings)

74
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,717
Hello? Yes? Oh.

75
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,177
(laughs nervously)

76
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,179
If you're looking
for that big donut of yours,

77
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,264
uh, Flanders has it.

78
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,807
Just smash open his house.

79
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,684
He came to life.

80
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,394
Good for him.

81
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,855
-(glass shattering)
-(rubble falling)

82
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,899
(approching stomps)

83
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,025
(doorbell)

84
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,404
-Help me, Lord!
-I told you!

85
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,781
Flanders has it.

86
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,158
Or Moe. Go kill Moe.

87
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,286
-(tires screeching)
-Homer, just give him the donut.

88
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,622
Once he has it, that'll be
the end of all this horror.

89
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,582
Well... okay.

90
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,084
If it'll end horror.

91
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,926
(barking)

92
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,052
(whimpers)

93
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,305
Don't you ever get tired

94
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,140
of being wrong
all the time?

95
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,684
Sometimes.

96
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,104
(Godzilla-like roar)

97
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,823
These monsters
are destroying

98
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,992
everything and everyone
we hold dear...

99
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,202
and you kids should
have jackets on.

100
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,745
Hey, what's that
in his footprint?

101
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,084
Hmm.

102
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,044
If your advertising agency

103
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,754
created all those
giant characters,

104
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,256
you must know
how to stop them.

105
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,883
Well, sir, advertising
is a funny thing.

106
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,469
If people stop
paying attention to it,

107
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,346
pretty soon,
it goes away.

108
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,223
Like that old woman
who couldn't find the beef?

109
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,558
Exactly.

110
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,310
If you stop paying attention
to the monsters,

111
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,978
they'll lose their powers.

112
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,187
But people can't help
looking at them.

113
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,397
They're wrecking
the town.

114
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,232
(roaring in distance)

115
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,360
You know, maybe
a jingle would help.

116

Mmm... sprinkles.

Homer, stop looking!

136
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,011
Don't make us poke
your eyes out, Dad.

137
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,096
Oh!

138
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,851
Here comes something.

139
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,478
Remember the story.

140
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,730
We're newlyweds on our way
to Earth capital.

141
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,566
D'oh. Shazbot!

142
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,985
<i>Even as I speak,</i>
<i>the scourge of advertising</i>

143
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,862
<i>could be heading</i>
<i>toward your town.</i>

144
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,989
<i>Lock your doors,</i>
<i>bar your windows,</i>

145
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,908
<i>because the next</i>

Okay boy,
catch the Frisbee.

149
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,384
Good catch, boy.

150
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,885
(English accent)
Thanks, Bart.

00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,559
Oh, hard luck.

00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,978
(stammering babble)

155
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,858
Ah!

156
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,029
Glad to rake
your acquaintance.

157
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,448
(laughing)

158
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,074

(sighs)

162
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,999
It was only a dream.

164
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:40,960
HOMER:
Bart! Is that you?

165
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,587
-Yes.
-Take out the garbage.

166
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,424
And then he raked me
across the chest.

167
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,217
And the weirdest thing was

168
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,220
it was that school janitor
who mysteriously disappeared,

169
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,555
Groundskeeper Willie.

170
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,265
Oh, my God, Bart,

171
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,309
Groundskeeper Willie
was in my nightmare, too,

172
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,729
but he got me
with hedge clippers.

173
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,191
He ran his floor buffer over me.

174
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,985
(chuckling) Children, I couldn't help
monitoring your conversation.

175
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,362
There's no mystery
about Willie.

176
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,239
Why, he simply disappeared.

177
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,366
Now, let's have
no more curiosity

178
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,077
about this bizarre cover-up.

179
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,538
Remember, class, the worse you do
on this standardized test,

180
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,915
the more funding
the school gets.

181
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,333
So don't knock yourselves out.

182
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,709
You have three hours to--

183
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,753
-Finished!
-Ugh.

184
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,380
Then put your head down
on your desk and sit quietly.

185
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,883
Ah... a duet of pleasures.

186
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,304
I am the wondrous wizard
of Latin!

187
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,766
I am a dervish of declension
and a conjuror of conjugation

188
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,810
with a million hit points
and maximum charisma!

189
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,688
Ha ha! Morire: to die.

190
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,857
Morit: he, she or it dies!

191
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,362
Moris: you die.

192
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,488
(screams)

193
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,281
(chortling)

194
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,992
You've mastered a dead tongue,
but can you handle a live one?

195
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,832
(choking)

196
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,042
(yelps)

197
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,628
(shrieks)

198
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,713
Ha ha!

199
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,591
Wheel him out quietly.

200
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,552
It's best the children
don't see him.

201
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,929
(all screaming)

202
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,598
Oh, just get it out of here.

203
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,058
Not into the kindergarten.

204
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,726
(high-pitched screams)

205
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,061
Mom, Dad!

206
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,188
Martin died
at school today.

207
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,774
Ooh.... I don't see
what that has to do

208
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,192
with Groundskeeper Willie.

209
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,069
Um...

210
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:33,072
We didn't mention
Groundskeeper Willie, Mom.

211
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,782
Mm...

212
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,993
Kids, it's time we told you
the true story

213
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,078
and put your fears to rest.

214
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,664
It's a story of murder
and revenge

215
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,000
from beyond the grave.

216
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,294

00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,558
Good advice.

228
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,692

Willie, please.

239
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,296
Mr. Van Houten

240
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,922
I for one
would like to see

241
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,758
the cafeteria menus
in advance

242
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,385
so parents can adjust their
dinner menus accordingly.

243
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,596
I don't like the idea
of Milhouse having

244
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,848
two spaghetti meals
in one day.

245
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:46,312
-(fire roaring)
-(anguished screaming)

246
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:50,858
You'll pay for this,
with your children's blood!

247
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,944
Oh, right. How you going to
get them? "Skeleton power"?

248
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:58,115
I'll strike where you
cannot protect them:

249
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,951
in their dreams.

250
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,707
Bart, don't you realize
what this means?

251
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,502
The next time we fall asleep,
we could die.

252
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,128

We can't
stay up forever.

261
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,813
You're right.

262
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,981
The only thing left to do
is go into my dream

263
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,442
and force Willie
into a final showdown.

264
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,902
You stay awake.

265
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,404
If it looks like I'm
in trouble, wake me up.

266
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,571
Okay.

267
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,156

grouchy.

Come on, Willie.

00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,629
I know you're out there.

272
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,093

273
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,267
The sandbox.

(grunts)

275
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,029
Hey, lawn boy!

276
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,239
You missed a spot!

277
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,868
When I'm done with you,

278
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,246
they'll have to do
a compost-mortem.

279
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,340
Ach! Sinky sand!

280
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,300
Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh!

283
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,599
Willie's gone for good.

284
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,934
Now I can get back
to my normal dreams.

285
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,729
Me and Krusty
winning the Super Bowl.

286
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,730
Bart, there's
two seconds left.

287
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,190
Now, listen up.

288
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,524
It's your basic
Statue of Liberty play

289
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,568
with one twist:
you throw it to me.

290
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,737
Knute Rockne called it
the forward pass.

291
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,864
Now, the clock's still running,
so it's important

292
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,657
we start this play as
quickly as possible.

293
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,950
(screams)

294
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,702
Oh, boy.

295
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,662
Don't dream
about me no more, kid.

296
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,081
Help. Lisa, help!

297
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,082
Bart, you're in trouble!
Wake up!

298
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,834
Wait a minute.

299
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,212
If you're here,
then you've fallen asleep too.

300
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,338
I'm not asleep.

301
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,464
I'm just resting my eye...

302
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,049
Uh-oh.

303
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,804
Good-bye, Bart.

304
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,138
Good-bye, Lise.

305
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,932
Hope you get
reincarnated as someone

306
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,558
who can stay awake
for 15 minutes.

307
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,354
(gasps)

308
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,776
(screams)

309
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,286
You saved us, Maggie.

310
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,752
I don't know, Bart.

311
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,754
Something tells me
Willie's still out there

312
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,382
and that he could come back
any time in any form

313
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,634
and kill us in ways
we can't even imagine.

314
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,389
Boo!

315
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,517
Ohh! Aah! Eeh!

316
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,518

318
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,354
Oh!

319
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,355
Stop!

320
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,274
I left my gun on the seat!

321
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,275
Hey!

322
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,276
(panting and gasping)

323
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,861
Wait here, please.

324
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,532
Ah, jeez.

325
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,992

326
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,124
MARGE:
Homer, get ready.

327
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,042
Patty and Selma
will be here any minute.

328
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,086
D'oh. Oh, no.

329
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,754
Better ride this one
out in the closet.

330
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,632
Sorry, Dad.
This is our spot.

331
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,969
Oh, yeah? Well, it's my house,
so it's my spot.

332
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,596
Na-aw. Cause we
called it.

333
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,180
-Did not.
-Well, we're calling it now.

334
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,557
-You are?
-'Fraid so.

335
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,517
They got me with
legal mumbo-jumbo.

336
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,191
-(growling)
-(doorbell rings)

337
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,068
MARGE:
Just a second!

338
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,778
Doo-ooh.

339
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,447
Huh?

340
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,199
I never looked behind this
what-cha-ma-call-it case before.

341
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,035
(laughing)

342
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,162
Huh? That's weird.

343
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:17,166
It's like something out of that
twilighty show about that zone.

344
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,002
How's it hanging, Marge?

345
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,464
Uck, I'm baking like a meat loaf
under this wet wool.

346
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,093
Uh, may I take
your coat, Aunt Selma?

347
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,263
Um, I would also like
to take your coat.

348
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,893
Have we got a family
activity for you.

349
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,812
A pillowcase full of seashells
from our trip to Sulfur Bay.

350
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,481
You're going to help us
clean and organize them.

351
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,274
And pry out all the
dead hermit crabs.

352
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,026
Get a screwdriver.

353
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,527
(squeals)

354
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,905
I'll take my chances
in the mystery wall.

355
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,751
HOMER'S BRAIN:

358

00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,472
Hey. You can
just suck them out.

361
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,057
HOMER (reverberating voice):
<i>Hello?</i>

362
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,517
<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

363
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,435
Homer, where are you?

364
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,480
<i>Uh, I'm somewhere,</i>
<i>where I don't know where I am.</i>

365
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,773
Do you see towels?

366
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,441
If you see towels,

367
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,985
you're probably
in the linen closet again.

368
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,195
<i>Just a second.</i>

369
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,407
<i>No. It's a place</i>
<i>I've never been before.</i>

370
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,491
Ah, the shower.

371
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,076
(laughing)

372
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,327
<i>Hey!</i>

373
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,671
I don't want to alarm you,
Marge,

374
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,507
<i>but I seem to be</i>
<i>trapped in here.</i>

375
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,967
We better call Ned.

376
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,301
He has a ladder.

377
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,303
What's going on here?

378
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:57,141
I'm so bulgy.

379
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,351
My stomach sticks way out
in front and my...

380
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,853
(screams)

381
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,939
Well, as the tree said
to the lumberjack,

382
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,899
I'm stumped.

383
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,527
It's like he just
disappeared into fat air.

384
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,112
(laughing)

385
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,989
Hey, shut up!

386
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,252
Mmm...

387
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,379
unprocessed fish sticks.

388
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,809
Man,

389
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,603
this place looks expensive.

390
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:46,273
I feel like I'm wasting
a fortune just standing here.

391
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,193
(humming)

392
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,736
Better make the most of it.

393
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,446
(burps)

394
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,990
Ow!

395
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,367
Watch it, coney!

396
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,661
(grunts)

397
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,371
(whistling sound)

398
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,539
Oops.

399
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,374
Do you see
a light, Homer?

400
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,001
<i>Yes.</i>

401
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,753
Move into the light,
my son.

402
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,754
(sizzling noise)

403
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:09,922
<i>Ow!</i>

404
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,465
Homer, this is
your physician

405
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,008
Dr. Julius Hibbert.

406
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,219
Can you tell us what
it's like in there?

407
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,305
Um... it's like, uh...

408
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,016
Did anyone see the
movie "Tron"?

409
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,017
-No.
-No.

410
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,268
-No.
-No.

411
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,603
-No.
-No.

412
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,771
-No.
-No.

413
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,772
Yes.

414
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,148
I mean, no. No.

415
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,861
Well, where's my Dad?

416
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,071
Well, it
should be obvious

417
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,281
to even the most
dimwitted individual

418
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,701
who holds an advanced degree
in hyperbolic topology

419
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,830
that Homer Simpson
has stumbled into...

420
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,373
the third dimension.

421
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,626
Sorry.

422
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,463
Here is an ordinary square.

423
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,049
Whoa, whoa,
slow down, egghead.

424
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,426
But suppose we
extend the square

425
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,637
beyond the two dimensions
of our universe

426
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,640
along the hypothetical
"z" axis there.

427
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,308
(all gasping)

428
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,311
This forms a three-dimensional
object known as a cube

429
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,273
or a frinkahedron in honor
of its discoverer.

430
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,649
Hoo-hey, hoo-hey.

431
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,359
<i>Help me!</i>

432
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,027
<i>Are you helping me</i>
<i>or are you going on and on?</i>

433
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,863
Oh, right.

434
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,490
And of course, within, we find
the doomed individual.

435
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,908
Enough of your borax,
Poindexter!

436
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,993
A man's life is at stake.

437
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,244
We need action.

438
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,166
Take that
you lousy dimension!

439
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,458
Huh? Huh?

440
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,461
Ah!

441
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,302
Oh, there's so much I don't know
about astrophysics.

442
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,180
I wish I read that book
by that wheelchair guy.

443
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,182
(screaming)

444
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,436
(whimpering)

445
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,027
I'll save Homer.

446
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,614
All I needs is four stout men
to work the bellows.

447
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,157
No, pops. It's too risky.

448
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,367
For all we know,
there could be cubes in there

449
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,161
the size of gorillas
and other large...

450
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,080
<i>Help! I don't have much time!</i>

451
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,666
That does it.
I'm going in.

452
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,626
Bart, no!

453
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,882
Cool, man.

454
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,139
Oh, my God, I'm going
to be sucked into a black hole.

455
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,016
I'm going to be sucked
into oblivion.

456
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,059
I'm going to be nothing.
And what's gonna be

457
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,436
coming out the other side,
I don't know.

458
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,854
I'll save you, Dad.

459
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,567
Oh, I can't get any closer.

460
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,361
You'll have to jump.

461
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,156
Piece of cake, son.

462
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,245
Crap, crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap, crap

463
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,496
crap, crap, crap, crap...

464
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,166
(screaming)

465
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,839
Bart, what happened?

466
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,675
Well, we hit a little snag

467
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,343
when the universe sort
of collapsed on itself

468
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,595
but Dad seemed
cautiously optimistic.
