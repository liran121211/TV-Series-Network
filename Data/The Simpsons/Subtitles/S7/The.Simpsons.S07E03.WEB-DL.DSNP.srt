D'oh!

00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:18,059

00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,046
Here's your toast, Maggie.

8
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,049
I melba-fied it myself.

9
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,469
Oh, Lisa, honey,
I tracked down

10
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,304
those old newspapers
for your history project.

11
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:57,348
Wow, Mom, you didn't have
to go to this much trouble.

12
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,225
Oh, it was no trouble.

13
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,852
The hobos at the dump
were very helpful.

14
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:03,980
Except one man who seemed
to have mental problems.

15
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,607
(muffled)
Good morning.

16
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,193
Bart, it's class photo day.
No Dracula fangs.

17
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,861
But they told us to wear them.

18
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,446
No, they didn't.

19
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,447
Huh?

20
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,867
And don't put signs
on your sister.

21
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,457
Now, keep the lettuce
separate until 11:30.

22
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,125
That way

23
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,835
the lettuce stays moist
and the bread stays dry.

24
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,337
Huh? Huh?

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,672
Mom, you fuss over us
way too much.

26
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,132
Enjoy it now

27
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,383
because when
you're a grown-up

28
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,927
you'll have to take care
of yourself.

29
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,303
(whining) Marge,

30
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,639
there's a spider
near my car keys.

31
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,767
You did the right thing
by telling me.

32
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,061
Shoo. Get out
of here.

33
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,396
(sighs)
That's better.

34
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,107
Now that we're alone,

35
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,443
Papa Bear has a little
honey for his Mama Bear.

36
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,653
(giggling)

37
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,113

38
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:57,408
(reading certificate)

39
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,618
"Mineral bath,
facial massage."

40
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,287
How did you afford these?

41
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,123
Oh-ho,
never you mind.

42
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,381
What advantages does
this motor car have

43
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,383
over say, a train?

44
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,385
Which I could
also afford.

45
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,803
Well, you'll notice

46
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,472
how the heated gas pedal
warms your feet while...

47
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,976
...gently massages
your buttocks.

48
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,394
Well, Count Homer

49
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,645
shall we discuss the--

50
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,771
No, we shan't.

51
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,691
Yoink!

52
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:34,237
Homie, this is so sweet,
but I can't possibly go now.

53
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,655
The sink is full
of dirty dishes.

54
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,781
The trash needs
to be taken out.

55
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,158
The living room
is a mess.

56
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,909
Oh, we'll clean up
this afternoon.

57
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,952
What about Maggie?

58
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,704
I got my Dad
to look after her.

59
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,497
Behind ya!

60
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,666
Don't do that!

61
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,376
Don't do that!

62
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,255
Come on, honey, you work
yourself stupid for this family.

63
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,799
If anyone deserves
to be wrapped up in seaweed

64
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,843
and buried in mud,
it's you.

65
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,846
Well, all right.

66
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,681
But I'm taking some of the ironing
with me in the ca-- Ohh!.

67
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,854
Tighten those braids, Missy.

68
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,105
-Hoist your flag, Dooley.
-(zipping)

69
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,025
Nelson, you look adorable.

70
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,735
I feel like
punching myself.

71
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,028
Bart, stop scratching.

72
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,863
You're messing up
your hair.

73
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,032
Ah!! Lice!

74
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,575
How on earth does a boy
get head lice

75
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,911
in this day and age?

76
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,496
We bought a wicker basket
from Trader Pete's

77
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,041
and he was passed out
inside.

78
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,919
(chittering)

79
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,631
Hey, how come I get lice and
nothing happens to Milhouse?

80
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,758
S-So cold.

81
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,510
So very, very cold.

82
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:45,225
See you in hell,
you wingless blood-suckers.

83
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,478
(tiny shrieks)

84
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,146
What kind of parents
would permit

85
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,732
such a lapse
in scalpel hygiene?

86
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,317
You'd better
check out his sister.

87
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,111
She could be rife
with them bugs, too.

88
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,489
Keep away.

89
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,407
Hey, come on.

90
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,408
Those are
prescription shoes.

91
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,160
I need them.

92
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,914
ALL: You have cooties,
you have cooties.

93
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,208
No, I don't.

My tongue.

99

Head's up.

100
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,933
Principal Skinner,
I need some shoes.

This is so relaxing.

106
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,079
Homie, this was
a wonderful idea.

107
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,039
(chuckling)
Yeah.

108
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,375
If that mafia guy
weren't staring at us

109
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,377
I'd take off my towel.

110

MAN: Oh, don't mind a-me.

111
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,464
Look, I do it first.

112
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,637
Whoa. Would you look
at this place?

113
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,265
Sink full of dirty dishes.
Trash not taken out.

114
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,183
Living room a mess.

115
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,852
Stacks of old newspapers...

116
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,478

found sleeping

123
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,201
Seems confused
and dehydrated.

124
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,703
Where's the baby?

125
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,038
That's her, ain't it?

126
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,708
Kids love that water.

127

Oh, my Lord!

128
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,212
Stupid babies need
the most attention.

Children, where
are your parents?

136
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,028
I don't know.

137
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,654
They should
be here.

138
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,907
Yes, they should...
be here.

139
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,658
Tsk, tsk.

140
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,369
Those parents better
have a good excuse.

141
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,703
(door opens)

142
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,539
I love getting away
from this dump.

143
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,334
It's like I'm on
some wonderful drug.

144
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,919
(clearing throat)

145
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,712
What's going on here?

146
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,255
Child Welfare, ma'am.

147
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,965
Here's a little
bedtime reading.

148
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,342
Hmm?

149
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,220
"Squalid hell hole?

(whimpers)

153
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,646
What are you doing
with my children?

154
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,481
We're taking them where
you can't get them.

155
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,983
What?! No, you can't!

156
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,610
I won't let you!

157
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,945
Mrs. Simpson, restrain yourself

158
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,988

160
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,248
Now just relax, kids.

161
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,875
All we're doing
is taking you to...

162
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,628

00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,468
-Yay!
-Heydilly-ho.

165
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,762
Welcome to your new home,
neglect-areenos.

166
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,559

your new foster family.

ROD & TODD:
We love you!

168
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,271
Uh, please don't hug me.

169
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,398
It sickens me.

170
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,108
I don't judge
Homer and Marge.

171
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,317
That's for a vengeful
God to do.

172
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,111
Mm-hmm. All we want to do

173
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,779
is give you kids
a good home

174
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,822
until they
get their act together.

175
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,115
You don't understand.

176
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,409
Mom and Dad
take good care of us.

177
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,536
That was a baby tooth.

178
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,622
It was loose!

179
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,374
Don't you worry,
little girl.

180
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,418
We'll get you some nice
county dentures.

183
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,016
We leave you the kids
for three hours

184
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,684
and the county
takes them away?!

185
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:00,104
Oh, bitch, bitch, bitch.

186
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,482
I can't believe
I put my own pleasure

187
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,233
ahead of my home
and family.

188
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,235
That is so like me.

189
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,862
Oh, Marge, don't
blame yourself.

190
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,864
I'm the terrible parent.

191
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,991
The boy bugs
the hell out of me.

192
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,118
I can't help Lisa
with her homework.

193
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,705
The only thing I'm fit to
take care of is a houseplant.

194
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,332
Lousy houseplant!

195
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,918
Oh, son of a--
I'll teach you to--

196
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,461
(sputtering)

197
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,639
Go with it!

198
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,141
Here you go, Todd,
the City Edition.

199
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,480
Bart, I don't know if this
should be an extra.

200
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,941
Is your source
on this reliable?

201
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,984
Oh, I hate this place.

202
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,070
Yeah, it seems
like our house

203
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,781
but everything's got a creepy
Pat Boone-ish quality to it.

204
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,408
Hey, kids, nachos,
Flanders-style!

205
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,160
That's cucumbers
with cottage cheese.

206
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,829
(sniffing)

207
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,540
(spitting)

208
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,334
Oh, Bart, I know you're
still getting adjusted here.

209
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,919
Tell you what,

210
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,046
we'll do whatever
you want to do.

211
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,506
Watch Itchy and Scratchy!

212
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,259
Well, I guess a little
television won't hurt.

213
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,511
I used to let the boys
watch "My Three Sons"

214
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,471
but it got them all
worked up before bedtime.

215
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,724
(blowing)

216
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,227
<i>♪ The Itchy & Scratchy show ♪</i>

217
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,401
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

218
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,120
<i>Ah...</i>

219
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,124
<i>(screaming)</i>

220
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,461
<i>(evil laughter)</i>

221
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,172
<i>Why? Why?</i>

222
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,884
<i>Oh... my only son.</i>

223
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,555
(laughing)

224
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,519
Daddy, what's
the red stuff

225
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,563
coming out of
kitty's ears?

226
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,566
Uh... that's just
raspberry jam.

227
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,776
Dad, should I poke Rod
with a sharp thing

228
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,028
like the mouse did?

229
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,531
No, son. No sirree, Bob.

230
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:19,910
Can you see them?

231
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,579
I can see Lisa...

232
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,623
but it might be
a starfish.

233
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,374
I got to call them.

234
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,501
(touch tones)

235
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,879
WOMAN'S VOICE:
<i>The number you have dialed</i>

236
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,756
<i>can no longer be reached</i>
<i>from this phone,</i>

237
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,840
<i>you negligent monster.</i>

238
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,635
-Oh...
-That's it.

239
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,054
We're going downtown
to get our kids back.

240
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,430
Right now!

241
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,351
We've always tried
to be good parents.

242
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,604
Please. I'm begging you
one mother to another.

243
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,230
You must have a family.

244
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,441
No. I don't care for children.

245
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,401
Now, wait a minute!

246
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,904
Okay. I'm not gonna win
Father of the Year.

247
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,657
In fact, I'm probably
the last guy in the world

248
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,783
who should have kids...

249
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,660
Well... wait...

250
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,453
Can I start again?

251
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,622
Fathering children is
the best part of my day.

252
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,540
I'd do anything
for Bart and Lisa.

253
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,501
-And, uh, Margaret?
-Who?

254
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,669
Lady, you got
the wrong file.

255
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,253
It's Maggie.

256
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,089
Oh, Maggie. I got
nothing against Maggie.

257
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,300
I can see you sincerely
want your children back

258
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,136
but you have a lot to learn
about being parents.

259
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,138
Before I can return
your children,

260
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,390
you'll have to complete
a course called

261
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,641
"Family Skills."

262
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,518
It teaches parents
to listen to--

263
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,187
-Communication. Gotcha.
-But it's important to--

264
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,939
-Listen, yes, I know--
-But there's more to it--

265
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,148
I have listening skills.

266
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,525
Mr. Simpson
would you please--

267
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,776
Shut up, Judge!

268
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,945
Peek-a-boo. I see you.

269
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:36,946
(giggles)

270
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,198
Peek-a-boo. I see you.

271
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,828
I never heard Maggie
laugh like that before.

272
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,162
Well, when was
the last time

273
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,164
Dad gave her that
kind of attention?

274
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,541
When she swallowed that
quarter,

275
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,750
he spent
all day with her.

276
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,043
I thought I could
ride this thing out

277
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,086
but everything's just
too weird here.

278
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,713
I know.

279
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,340
They put honey on pancakes
instead of maple syrup.

280
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,801
And they read Newsweek
instead of nothing.

281
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,386
C'mon you Gloomy-Gusses.

282
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,513
Who's up for a big bowl of
non-fat ice milk?

283
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,098
I want wintergreen.

284
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,099
Unflavored for me.

285
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,855
And then I saw my boy
in a burlap sack

286
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,232
and they told me
he had lice.

287
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,276
This story going
somewhere?

288
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,777
All right, easy there, Flub.

289
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,154
We're all going
to get a chance.

290
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,030
Mrs. Skinner,
why are you here?

291
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,240
The county is threatening

292
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,117
to take my Seymour away.

293
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,413
We had another fight over
the inflatable bath pillow.

294
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,207
I kept screeching and
screeching at him but--

295
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,252
Alright. Very good.
Now who knows how the Skinners

296
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,212
could have resolved
this problem?

297
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,381
Without resorting to violence...

298
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,341
or childish name-calling.

299
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,843
Anybody?

300
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,303
Okay, that's okay.

301
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,763
Because making a happy home

302
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,931
isn't like flipping on
a light switch.

303
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,683
Duh, light switch?

304
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,226
There are a lot of
little tricks to it.

305
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,811
Things you should have
learned a long time ago.

306
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,648
Such as: if you leave milk out,
it can go sour.

307
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,358
Put it in the refrigerator

308
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,153
or failing that,
a cool, wet sack.

309
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,741
And put your garbage
in a garbage can, people.

310
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,159
I can't stress that enough.

311
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,744
Don't just throw it
out the window.

312
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,205
This is so humiliating.

313
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,207
"Garbage in garbage can."

314
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,792
Hmm, makes sense.

315
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,628
Nighty night, my sweet
little foundling-a-dings.

316
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,213
But it's only 7:00.

317
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,632
Yeah, the sun is still out.

318
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,801
(children chattering)

319
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,302
(both sighing)

320
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,434

325
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:49,119
You know, Maggie hasn't been
a Simpson as long as us.

326
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,831
I think she's beginning
to forget Mom and Dad.

327
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,667
Remember how Mom used
to microwave our underwear

328
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,210
on cold days?

329
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,003
Or the way Dad used
to call the radio station

330
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,797
with fake traffic tips?

331
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,926
(both sighing)

332
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,261
They're ten feet away

333
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,971
and we can't even
talk to them.

334
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,723
I wish I could tell them
how much I miss them.

335
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,443
It's so quiet here
without the kids.

336
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,445
What I wouldn't give
to hear Lisa play

337
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,739
another one
of her jazzy tunes.

338
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,784
Saxa-ma-phone.

339
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,703
Saxa-ma-phone.

340
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,454
Aw...

341
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,498
I miss the way Bart
would say something

342
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,542
and then say "dude."

343
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,669
I wish I knew something
about the baby

344
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:39,837
I could miss now.

345
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,131
-You mean Maggie?
-That's it.

346
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,175
We've never been separated
from the kids for so long.

347
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,468
I don't know how much
more I can take.

348
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,304
(rapid doorbell ringing)

349
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,805
BOTH: That's Bart's ring!

350
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,485
"Todd smells."

351
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,195
Aw, I already knew that.

352
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,655
Look at the other side.

353
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,537
(both sighing)

354
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,459
Okay let's see if
we've learned anything.

355
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:22,463
I want you two to simulate a
typical household problem. Go.

356
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,925
Pa, I cut myself
on the screen door again.

357
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,676
Why you cotton-pickin'--!

358
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,677
(growling)

359
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,095
(gagging)

360
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,188
No, I got to pass
this class for my kids.

361
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,441
Son, let's stop
the fussin' and a-feudin'.

362
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,360
I love you, Pa.

363
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,278
I love you, Cletus.

364
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,238
(laughing and crying)

365
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,158
(cheering, applause)

366
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,285
(gunshots)

367
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,037
Well, children,
it's Saturday night

368
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,123
so what say we let our hair
down and play Bombardment--

369
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,500
-Yay!
-Yay!

370
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,210
Of Bible Questions?

371
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,544
-Yay!
-Yay!

372
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,796
Which version shall it be?

373
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,922
St. James.

374
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,298
The Vulgate
of St. Jerome.

375
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,968
Vulgate it is.

376
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,178
-Oh...
-Okay, for one gold star,

377
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,682
what Persian king exempted
the Levites from taxation?

378
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,684
-Ataxerxes.
-Righty-o!

379
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,896
(cough)

380
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,486
-NED: Well?
-I know!

381
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,197
No, son, we got to let
Bart and Lisa get one.

382
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,740
Come on,
this one's easy.

383
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,910
We give up.

384
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,453
Well, guess.

385
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,288
Book of Revelations...
fire-breathing lion's head.

386
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,415
Tail made
out of snakes.

387
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,749
Who else is it gonna be?

388
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,126
Jesus?

389
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,379
Je-- Jes--

390
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,131
Don't you kids know anything?

391
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,049
The Serpent of Rehaboam?

392
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,260
The Well of Zohassadar?

393
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,221
The Bridal Feast
of Beth Chadruharazzeb?

394
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,974
That's the kind of thing you should
start learning at baptism.

395
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,144
Um, actually, you see...

396
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,770
we were never baptized.

397
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,813
(gasping)

398
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,023
(moaning)

399
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,776
Oh, Neddie! Neddie!

400
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,028
Neddie!

401
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,698
No, that ain't
gonna do it.

402
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,658
(moaning)

403
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,368
I'm very proud of you people.

404
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,619
You've learned how to care
for your children,

405
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,996
how to maintain
your homes,

406
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,165
and you've all passed
the drug test.

407
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,541
Except for Marge.

408
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,626
Marge, you tested positive
for crack and P.C.P.

409
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,462
Oh, my!

410
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,589
Okay, the re-test
says you're clean.

411
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,798
Sorry about the mistake.

412
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,593
The only thing
I'm high on is love.

413
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,637
Love for my son
and daughters.

414
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:39,099
Yes, a little L.S.D.
is all I need.

415
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,560
All right,
sounds very good.

416
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,479
(laughter and gunshots)

417
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,900
Jeepers H. Crackers.

418
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:48,984
I'd better call the reverend.

419
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,198
Ned Flanders
is on the phone.

420
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,742
Hello, Ned.

421
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,118
Reverend, emergency.

422
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,453
I-- It's
the Simpson kids.

423
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,330
Eedily... baptism...

424
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,332
oodily...
doodily, doodily!

425
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,000
Ned, have you thought

426
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,585
about one of the other
major religions?

427
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,546
They're all
pretty much the same.

428
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,215
(crash)

429
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,258
Oh... damn Flanders.

430
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,763
Looks like I'm gonna have to
baptize you myself.

431
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,602
(air horn blares
"Hallelujah Chorus")

432
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,772
Kids, we're
good parents now.

433
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,190
Get your asses out here!

434
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,900
We missed you
so much.

435
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,235
(gasps)

436
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,490
He's going to baptize
our children?

437
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,991
Oh, no!

438
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,536
In the eyes of God,
they'll be Flanderseseses.

439
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,455
Until this I never thought
Homer and Marge were bad parents

440
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,040
but now I know
you kids need

441
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,750
a less
hell-bound family.

442
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,043
Just sit back

443
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,294
and before you know it,

444
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,630
you'll be part
of the Flanders flock.

445
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,798
(laughs)

446
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,716
You're gonna be
Lisa Flanders.

447
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,301
You're going
to be Bart Flanders.

448
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,344
Ah!

449
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,138
Oh, relax, Bart.

450
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,848
Your sister Maggie
isn't scared.

451
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,766
That's because she can't talk.

452
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,812
Daddily-doodily.

453
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,025
Where are we going?
Where are we going?

454
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,735
Okay, okay. Don't panic.

455
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,197
To find Flanders, I just have
to think like Flanders.

456
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,991
HOMER'S BRAIN:

462

Today we write a new page

463

in the Flanders family bible.

464
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,269
Who wants to be the first
to enter God's good graces?

465
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,355
Easy, easy.

466
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,356
(approaching car)

467
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,944
Oh, why do You hate my trains?

468

(gasps)

474
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,842
Do you reject Satan

475
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,844
and all
his empty promises?

476
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:26,600
(in slow motion)
No!

477
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,395
(sizzling)

478
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,357
(pained yell)

479
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,661
Wow, Dad, you took
a baptismal for me.

480
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,329
How do you feel?

481
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,249
Oh, Bartholomew, I feel
like St. Augustine of Hippo

482
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,793
after his conversion
by Ambrose of Milan.

483
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,128
Wait, Homer--
What did you just say?

484
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,047
I said shut your ugly face,
Flanders!

485
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,423
Oh. Fair enough.

486
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,842
Oh. There's my sweet
little Maggie.

487
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,119
Oh, Maggie, you're
a Simpson again.

489
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,463
So, what was it like
at the Flanders' house?

490
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,840
Yeah, give me
all the dirt.

491
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,801
Let's see...
dirt... dirt.

492
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,261
Well, there wasn't
really much dirt.

493
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,263
There was a bunch
of old paint cans

494
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,347
in the garage, though.

495
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,349

496
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,268
