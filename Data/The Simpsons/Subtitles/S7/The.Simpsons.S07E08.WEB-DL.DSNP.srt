Here's your
caption boys:

00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,033
"Local hero shuns spotlight
and pitches in."

8
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,992
What an angle.

9
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,457
I can't believe I'm spending
my Saturday picking up garbage.

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,666
I mean, half these bottles
ain't even mine.

(all grumbling)

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,677
Hey, where's Homer?

15
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,304
How'd he get
out of this?

16
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,472
HOMER:
Hey, everybody!

17
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,931
Up here!

18
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,018
Simpson, stop frolicking
and get to work.

19
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,686
Right away, Mr. Smithers.

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,023
I'll just walk across
these slippery ro... aah!

21
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,401
Oh, no! He's going
over the falls!

22
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,615
Oh, good. He snagged
that tree branch.

23
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,408
Oh, no!
The branch broke off.

24
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,245
Oh, good. He can grab on
to them pointy rocks.

25
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,538
Oh, no!

26
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,499
Them rocks broke
his arms and legs.

27
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,460
Oh, good.
Those helpful beavers

28
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,503
are swimming out
to save him.

29
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,129
Oh, no.

30
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,632
They're biting him
and stealing his pants.

31
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,469
Good Lord. He'll be sucked
into the turbine.

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,598
(all gasp)

33
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,644
Smithers,
Who was that corpse?

34
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,145
Homer Simpson, sir.

35
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,355
(sniffling)

36
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,357
One of the finest,
bravest men

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,609
ever to grace Sector 7G.

38
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,653
(sobbing)

39
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,531
I'll cross him
off the list.

40
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,698
(Bart laughing)

41
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,617
That dummy worked
like a charm, Dad.

42
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,410
Best 600 bucks
I ever spent.

43
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,495
Come on, boy.

44
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,663
We've earned this Saturday.

45
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,082
Now let's make
the most of it!

46
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,048
61, 62, 63...

47
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,889
Marge, we can't tell you
how sorry we are.

48
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,268
You have our deepest
condol-diddly-olences.

49
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,894
I'm sorry.
I-I'm just nervous.

50
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,104
I didn't mean
any disrespect.

51
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,272
What are you talking about?

52
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,273
You know, uh...

53
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,608
Homer's passing.

54
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,069
Away.

55
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,321
Into death.

56
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,198
What?

57
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,285
That's ridiculous.
Homer's not dead.

58
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,661
He's right out back
in the hammock.

59
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,876
Oh, Marge, of course
Homer's alive.

60
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,545
He's alive in
all our hearts.

61
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,588
Yes, Marge.

62
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,589
I can see him.

63
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,425
Hi, everybody.

64
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,551
Marge, I'm going to
give you the card

65
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,886
of our juvenile
counselor.

66
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:58,887
(doorbell rings)

67
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,974
A tombstone?

68
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,350
It came with
the burial plot.

69
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,810
But that's
not important.

70
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,104
The important thing is,
Homer's dead.

71
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,231
We've been saving for this
since your wedding day.

72
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,775
Get out of here
you ghouls!

73
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,612
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.

74
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,821
Hmm?

75
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,782
Uh, excuse me.

76
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,368
Sir, I think there's
been a mistake.

77
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,745
Oh, no. No mistake.

78
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:24,913
Your electricity's
in the name

79
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,748
of Homer J. Simpson,
deceased.

80
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,209
The juice stays off till you
get a job or a generator.

81
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,169
Oh, and, uh, my
deepest sympathies.

82
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,504
Mmm... Homer?

83
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,547
That's my name.

84
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,007
When I asked you
if that dummy

85
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,092
was to fake your own
death, you told me no.

86
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,719
You go downtown first
thing in the morning

87
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,262
and straighten this out.

88
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,764
LISA:
Mom! Dad!

89
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,266
Bart ran into a doorframe
and bit his tongue!

90
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,227
BART: What the hell'th
goin' on heah?

91
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,940
Listen here. My name
is Homer J. Simpson.

92
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,858
You guys think I'm dead,
but I'm not.

93
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,610
Now I want you
to straighten this out

94
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,111
without a lot of your bureaucratic
red tape and mumbo jumbo.

95
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,988
Okay, Mr. Simpson

96
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,575
I'll just make the change
here... and you're all set.

97
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,703
I don't like your attitude,
you water-cooler dictator.

98
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,705
What do you have in that
secret government file, anyway?

99
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,831
I have a right to read it.

100
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,458
You sure do.

101
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,668
"Wife: Marjorie.

102
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,670
Children: Bartholomew,
Lisa..."

103
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,507
Ah-hah! See? This thing
is all screwed up.

104
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,425
Who the heck
is "Margaret" Simpson?

105
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,760
Uh... your youngest daughter.

106
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,388
(mimicking)
"Uh... your youngest daughter."

107
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,847
Well, how about this?

108
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,641
This thing says
my mother's still alive!

109
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,476
She died when I was a kid!

110
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,978
You see that stone angel
up there?

111
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,021
That's my mother's grave.

112
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,732
My Dad points it out
every time we drive by.

113
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,401
Mr. Simpson, uh...

114
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,652
maybe you should actually

115
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,945
go up there.

116
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,029
Huh?

117
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,325
Oh, Mom, I'm sorry
I never come to see you.

118
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,119
I'm just not a cemetery person.

119
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,454
"Here lies...

120
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,789
Walt Whitman"?

121
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,207
(yelling)

122
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,709
Damn you, Walt Whitman!

123
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:57,046
I-hate-you-
Walt-freakin'-Whitman!

124
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,590
Leaves of Grass, my ass!

125
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,467
Wait a minute.

126
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:05,680
Maybe it's that other grave--
the one that says "Simpson"!

127
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,723
(shrieking)

128
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,308
Oh!

129
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,810
Why does my death
keep coming back to haunt me?

130
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,061
Oh!

131
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,940
You awful, awful man!

132
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,734
Get out of my son's grave!

133
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,195
I hate to rain on your parade,
lady, but this is my grave.

134
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,572
Hey...

135
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,781
wait a minute...

136
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,158
Mom?

137
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,701
Homer?

138
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,372
I thought you were dead!

139
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,291
I thought you were dead!

140
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,126
Oh, dang blast it.

141
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,962
Isn't anybody in this
dad-gummed cemetery dead?

142
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,131
I didn't want
to cause a fuss

143
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,758
but now that
you mention it...

144
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:49,265
Oh, Homer, you
grew up so handsome.

145
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,309
Some people say
I look like Dan Aykroyd.

146
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,896
I can't believe
you're here.

147
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,565
Dad always told me you died
while I was at the movies.

148
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,234
Oh, my poor baby.

149
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,404
You must have been so upset.

150
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,406
But I suppose Abe
has his reasons.

151
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,451
Yeah, well... where have you
been all this time?

152
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,287
Oh, it's a very
complicated story.

153
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,872
Let's just enjoy
this moment.

154
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,291
Mom, there's something
you should know about me.

155
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,335
I almost always
spoil the moment.

156
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,339
(burping)

157
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,673
I'm sorry.

158
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,425
That's okay, darling.

159
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,426
It wasn't your fault.

160
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,681
Hey, everybody, I got
a big surprise for you.

161
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,267
Presenting... my mother!

162
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,353
(gasps)

163
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,396
Your mother?
That's Grandma Simpson?

164
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,231
Can you
believe it?

165
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,315
I thought
she was dead.

166
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,316
Hello.

167
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,692
This is so weird.

168
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,444
It's like something
out of Dickens

169
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,904
or Melrose Place.

170
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,280
Where have you
been, Granny?

171
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,281
Did they freeze
you or something?

172
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,574
(laughing)

173
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,535
Oh, my,
such clever grandchildren.

174
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:54,038
So full of questions
and bright, shiny eyes.

175
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,623
I don't know what to say.

176
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,958
I finally have a mother-in-law.

177
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,584
(giggling)

178
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,962
No more living vicariously
through my girlfriends.

179
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,672
(giggles and coughs)

180
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,881
Hey.

181
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,341
Since you
were a no-show

182
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,051
at all the big
moments of my life,

183
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,554
you owe me years
of back presents.

184
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:13,349
Christmases, birthdays, Easters,
Kwanzas, good report cards...

185
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,436
Hmm. 75 bucks a pop
plus interest and penalties...

186
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,188
You owe me $22,000.

187
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,440
I'll Kwanza you!

188
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,358
Gaa! Gaa!

189
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,902
Homer, don't be so hard
on little...

190
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,529
(whispering)
What is his name?

191
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,989
This is my room.

192
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,907
This is my dresser.

193
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,534
It's where I keep my shirts
when I'm not wearing them.

194
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,078
Oh, yes,
right in the drawers.

195
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,580
(both laughing)

196
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,959
You remembered.

197
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:44,547
Oh, I've missed moments
like this... Mom.

198
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,424
I saw all
your awards, Lisa.

199
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,092
They're mighty impressive.

200
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,344
Oh, I just keep them
out to bug Bart.

201
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,596
Don't be bashful.

202
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,556
When I was your age,
kids made fun of me

203
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,558
because I read at
the ninth-grade level.

204
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,268
Me too!

205
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,478
Hey, Mom, look at me!

206
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,271
Look at what I can do!

207
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,355
I see you, Homer.

208
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,857
That's very nice.

209
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,776
Although I hardly consider
"A Separate Peace"

210
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,903
the ninth-grade level.

211
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,571
Yeah, more like preschool.

212
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,572
I hate John Knowles.

213
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,573
Me too.

214
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,284
(both laughing)

215
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,536
(both sighing)

216
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,206
Mom, you're not
looking!

217
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,291
You know, Lisa,
I feel like I have

218
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,460
an instant rapport with you.

219
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,837
(gasps)
You didn't dumb it down.

220
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,797
You said "rapport."

221
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,426
Got to run.
Grandma stuff.

222
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,766
Huh?

223
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,976
(turns dryer on)

224
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,811
There. Now no one should
be able to hear us.

225
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:41,812
What?

226
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,231
(turns dryer off)

227
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,232
All right, we don't
need the dryer.

228
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,274
What?!

229
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,318
Just shut up and listen.

230
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,278
There's something
fishy about Grandma.

231
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,405
Whenever we ask her where
she's been all this time

232
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,949
she changes the subject.

233
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,575
And just now when a
police car drove by

234
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,118
she ran into the house.

235
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,662
Yeah, I don't
trust her, either.

236
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,996
When I was going
through her purse

237
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,039
look what I found.

238
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,499
LISA:
"Mona Simpson."

239
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,833
"Mona Stevens."

240
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,085
"Martha Stewart."

241
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,336
"Penelope Olsen."

242
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,838
"Muddy Mae Suggins."

243
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,633
These are the calling cards
of a con artist.

244
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,803
Whoo-hoo!

245
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,596
I'm so glad
to have my Mom back.

246
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,099
I never realized
how much I missed her.

247
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,560
She's nice.

248
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,186
But?

249
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,938
I just don't think
you should get too excited

250
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,899
about the woman who
abandoned you for 25 years.

251
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,317
You could get hurt again.

252
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,070
First, it wasn't 25 years.

253
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,155
It was 27 years.

254
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,366
And second, she had
a very good reason.

255
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,492
Which was?

256
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,536
I don't know.

257
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,871
I guess I was
just a horrible son

258
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,498
(crying)
and no mother would want me.

259
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,916
Oh, Homie.

260
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,085
Come on, you're a sweet,
kind, loving man.

261
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,421
I'm sure you were
a wonderful son.

262
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,256
Then why did she leave me?

263
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,591
Let's find out.

264
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,345
Mother Simpson,
we'd like to ask you

265
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,097
a few questions
about your past.

266
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,724
Can't reminisce.
Sleeping.

267
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,183
(snoring)

268
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,562
Spill it, Muddy Mae,
or we're calling the cops.

269
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,063
Please don't.

270
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,649
Alright, then we'll call
your husband-- Grampa.

271
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,234
No! I'll talk.

272
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,360
I'll tell you everything.

273
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,945
I've wanted to tell you.

274
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,574
It all started in the '60s.

275
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,161
Take out wrenched ankle.

276
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,287
(buzzing)

277
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,832
Mom! Mom! Mom!

278
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,877
Oh, my little Homie Bear.

279
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,546
Time for bed.

280
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,715
Sing me my

00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,739
Probably. I'm trying

take you?

308
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,246

00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,834

363

365

369
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,638
Homer?

370
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,603
(sobbing)

371
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,688
I'll miss you, Homer.

372
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,902
I thought I dreamed that kiss.

373
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,363
(sniffling)

374
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,907
I'm so sorry
I misjudged you, Mom.

375
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,201
You had to leave
to protect your family.

376
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,828
How did you survive?

377
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,080
Oh, I had help from
my friends in the underground.

378
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,748
Jerry Rubin
gave me a job

379
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,709
marketing his line
of health shakes.

380
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,752
I proofread Bobby
Seale's cookbook

381
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,170
and I ran credit checks

382
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,630
at Tom Hayden's
Porsche dealership.

383
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,173
Wait a minute.

384
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,217
There's one thing
I don't understand.

385
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,596
In all those years, why didn't
you ever try to contact me?

386
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,972
But I did.

387
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,891
I sent you a care package
every week.

388
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,767
Aw come on, Mom.
We use that same line

389
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,311
on the kids
when they're at camp.

390
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,812
But I did. I really did.

391
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,771
I'll prove it to you.

392
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,985
Any undelivered mail
for Homer J. Simpson?

393
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,529
No... oh, wait. This.

394
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,281
That's what happens

395
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,908
when you don't tip your
letter carrier at Christmas.

396
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,367
Yes, I'd like to send
this letter

397
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,912
to the Prussian consulate
in Siam by aeromail.

398
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,164
Am I too late
for the 4:30 auto-gyro?

399
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,541
Uh... I better look
in the manual.

400
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,001
Oh, the ignorance.

401
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,463
Wait a minute.

402
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,381
I know that woman.

403
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,382
But from when,

404
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,968
and in what capacity?

405
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,011
(gasping)

406
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,012
It's her.

407
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,138
At last.

408
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,890
This book must
be out of date.

409
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,893
I don't see Prussia,
Siam or auto-gyro.

410
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,478
Well, keep looking.

411
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,104
(gasps)

412
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,944
Are you sure this is the woman
you saw in the Post Office?

413
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,195
Absolutely.

414
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,196
Who could forget
such a monstrous visage?

415
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,530
She has the sloping brow

416
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,908
and cranial bumpage
of the career criminal.

417
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,284
Uh, sir, phrenology
was dismissed

418
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,911
as quackery
160 years ago.

419
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,496
Of course,
you'd say that

420
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,873
You have the brainpan
of a stagecoach tilter.

421
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,792
At any rate, the F.B.I.
will track down

422
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,586
this mystery woman
and put her behind bars.

423
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,798
How does it happen, Joe?

424
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,799
How does what
happen?

425
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,300
How does a sweet young lady

426
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,011
mortgage her future for
a bunch of scraggly ideals

427
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,180
and greasy-haired promises?

428
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,932
Maybe she thought the war on
southeast Asia was so immoral

429
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,350
her end justified the means.

430
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,686
Gee, Joe, you haven't
been the same

431
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,063
since your son went
crazy in Vietnam.

432
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,189

Oh, Abe.
You've aged terribly.

a lot of sense.

set the cause of biological

We're only now
finally caught up.

earlier that day.

487
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,744

your assistance

Oh, you're fresh.

492

Don't you want to play

Ma'am, we're all good cops.

494

But bring back some
of them, uh, gyros.

into your wallet.

ever thought

511

to Springfield?

There's nothing to be
alarmed about,

520
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,440
but could you take one
last look at the family

521
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,524
and join me in the kitchen?

00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,864
It's all thanks
to our anonymous tipster.

539
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,076
But who are you
and why did you tip us off?

540
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,245
<i>Well, it's 'cause of your</i>
<i>old lady that I got rid</i>

541
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,747
<i>of the asthma that was</i>
<i>keeping me out of the academy.</i>

542
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,082
Thanks.

543
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,542
Sure. Just think of me
as an anonymous friend

544
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,212
who rose through the ranks
of the Springfield Police

545
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,838
to become
Chief Clancy Wig...

546
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,923
(dial tone)

547
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,508
Yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak.

548
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,928
(horn beeping)

549
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,846
Well, there's my ride.

550
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,890
The underground awaits.

551
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,269
(sniffling) At least this time
I'm awake for your good-bye.

552
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,771
(sniffing)
Oh, Homer.

553
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,898
Remember: whatever happens,

554
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,191
you have a mother

555
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,568
and she's truly
proud of you.

556
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,115
Oh...

557
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,450
Oh! Hurry up, man.

558
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,495
This electric van only has
20 minutes of juice left.

559
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,790
Don't forget me.

560
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:32,916
Don't worry, Homer.

561
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,043
You'll always be a part of me.

562
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,211
D'oh!

563
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,648

564
