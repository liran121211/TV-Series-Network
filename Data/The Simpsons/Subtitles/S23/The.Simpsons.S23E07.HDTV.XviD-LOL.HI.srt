1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,467
Hey.

2
00:00:04,518 --> 00:00:05,968
(yelling)
(laughing)

3
00:00:06,475 --> 00:00:07,708
Is there any
better feeling

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,177
than waiting for a live
Krusty show to start?

5
00:00:10,228 --> 00:00:13,013
Maybe watching your bride
coming down the aisle.

6
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:14,048
Hmm.

7
00:00:14,116 --> 00:00:17,401
(organ plays discordant music)

8
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:20,604
(grunting)

9
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:22,123
(sobbing)

10
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,425
Why does she get to eat
before the reception?

11
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:25,993
(sobbing)

12
00:00:26,018 --> 00:00:29,518

14
00:00:34,569 --> 00:00:36,954
Seltzer bottle connected
and pressurized?

15
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:38,472
Check.

16
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,207
Roll-up dicky
set to six?

17
00:00:40,258 --> 00:00:41,976
Nope. 11.
(gasps)

18
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:44,820
My comedy comes
from taking risks.

19
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:47,110
Or avoiding them,
I can't remember.

20
00:00:47,135 --> 00:00:48,608
Krusty, we need to talk.

21
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:51,089
Make it fast.
I got a coiled up spring

22
00:00:51,114 --> 00:00:53,038
ready to boi-oi-oi-oi-oing.

23
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:57,144
Oh, why can't I be funny
with just my words?

24
00:00:57,154 --> 00:00:59,488
Bill Maher doesn't put dangerous
things near his crotch,

25
00:00:59,556 --> 00:01:01,557
except when
he's off work.

26
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:02,958
(laughs)
Yeah.

27
00:01:03,026 --> 00:01:05,628
It's about your vodka,
Absolut Krusty.

28
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:07,062
We're having trouble
persuading people

29
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,665
it's hip to drink a
vodka made by a clown,

30
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:11,367
in a bottle shaped
like a clown,

31
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:13,035
that does this
when you open it.

32
00:01:13,103 --> 00:01:14,203
(ooga horn sounds)

33
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:15,337
(laughs)

34
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:16,772
Always gets me.

35
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,107
Yeah, plus,
that TV special

36
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:20,543
where you drank another brand
of vodka didn't help.

37
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,845
I used up my stuff
poisoning deer.

38
00:01:22,913 --> 00:01:24,613
If we're ever gonna
sell your vodka,

39
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:26,515
we need to do something
completely unorthodox--

40
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:27,817
a viral marketing
campaign.

41
00:01:27,884 --> 00:01:29,018
(metallic creaking)

42
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:30,352
Get to the point!

43
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,788
Unless you want a face
full of clown chunks!

44
00:01:32,856 --> 00:01:34,757
People are more likely
to drink your vodka

45
00:01:34,825 --> 00:01:37,326
if they think all their
coolest friends are drinking it.

46
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:39,061
So, we pay for
a big party

47
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:40,863
at the home of a
Springfield trendsetter.

48
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:43,732
Your Brockman,
your Bumblebee Man...

49
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,635
He invites his cool friends,
we serve free cocktails,

50
00:01:46,703 --> 00:01:49,071
made with your vodka,
generating buzz.

51
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:50,606
We got buzz.

52
00:01:50,674 --> 00:01:52,007
<i>Positive</i> buzz.

53
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:54,143
That exists? Wow.

54
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:57,246
So, all you have to do is find
one of your loyal fans

55
00:01:57,314 --> 00:01:59,448
whose house we can trash
and friends you can exploit.

56
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:00,516
(metallic creaking)

57
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:02,251
(gasps, grunts)

58
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,752
I need a drink.

59
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,522
Not that!
Never that!

60
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,456
(theme music plays)

61
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:08,891
Hey, hey, kids!

62
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,293
Who wants to host
a viral marketing event?

63
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:12,795
ALL:
Yay!

64
00:02:12,863 --> 00:02:15,130
All you have to do
is write me a letter

65
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:17,499
about how hip and influential
your parents are.

66
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:19,501
Milhouse, I'm gonna
win that thing.

67
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:20,903
How do you know, Bart?

68
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:23,138
Maybe for once <i>I'll</i> win.

69
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:25,608
Children of troubled marriages
not eligible.

70
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:27,109
Oh!

71
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:28,410
(birds singing)

72
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:30,512
So, uh, why
are you here?

73
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,681
Is it about that unauthorized
Krusty lookalike

74
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:34,350
I hired for Lisa's
first communion?

75
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:35,484
What was his name?

76
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:37,286
Krappy the Klunk. See?

77
00:02:37,354 --> 00:02:40,089
Homer, we're here
to throw the most redonkulous

78
00:02:40,156 --> 00:02:42,424
marketing outreach
this town's ever seen.

79
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:45,127
All you have to do is invite
every cool person you know.

80
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:46,495
Hey, I wrote the application.

81
00:02:46,563 --> 00:02:48,430
Do any of my friends get
to come?

82
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:49,732
One friend.

83
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:51,634
He can listen to music
with headphones on,

84
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:53,269
he gets one slice
of cheese pizza,

85
00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:54,770
and if the party
gets slow,

86
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:57,139
he has to pretend to let
Krusty save him from drowning.

87
00:02:57,207 --> 00:02:58,307
Redonkulous!

88
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,408
Off the dilge!

89
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:02,912
(dance music playing)

90
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:04,446
(tires squeak)

91
00:03:04,514 --> 00:03:08,417
(crowd chatter)

92
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:11,387
This party is so much better
than the crummy ones we plan.

93
00:03:11,454 --> 00:03:12,588
(laughs)

94
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:14,790
I hope Bart's having fun.

95
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:18,027
And that's why John Gielgud
is more of a father to me

96
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:19,762
than my own father.

97
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:21,630
Where's the nachos
you promised?

98
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:24,300
There'll be time enough
for nachos!

99
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:27,036
Why can't I go to
the grown-up room?

100
00:03:27,103 --> 00:03:29,571
You said the clown scared you.

101
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,407
Well, he did a little.

102
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:33,108
(crowd chatter
and laughter)

103
00:03:33,176 --> 00:03:35,477
Boy, everyone from the
nuclear plant is here.

104
00:03:35,545 --> 00:03:36,979
Except the bosses,
of course.

105
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:39,081
Yeah, even Homer's not dumb
enough to invite...

106
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:40,482
BURNS:
So!

107
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,784
This is the famous party.

108
00:03:41,851 --> 00:03:43,352
Feh.

109
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,520
Guh.

110
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:46,221
Pffoy.

111
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:48,023
(crowd chatter)

112
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,195
He's destroying
our youthful demographic!

113
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:55,030
Oh, God, I need a drink!

114
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:59,768
So the car in front of us
forgot to validate his... uh...

115
00:03:59,836 --> 00:04:02,705
(laughing):
I was in an anecdote once.

116
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:05,007
Um, I have surgery
in the morning.

117
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:07,743
Yeah, and I'm the one
having the surgery.

118
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:09,578
(sighs)

119
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:10,913
Homer, you're
the nominal host.

120
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:12,181
Do something!

121
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:14,350
Oh! Uh! Oh!

122
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:16,852
Mr. Burns,

123
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,887
so glad you're here.

124
00:04:18,955 --> 00:04:20,889
Finally, the party
can get started.

125
00:04:20,957 --> 00:04:23,258
Your cotillion seems
to be in full promenade.

126
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:24,693
(laughs):
Good one.

127
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:28,330
Uh, Mr. Burns, everyone is dying
to hear you sing karaoke.

128
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:31,000
Come on, just pick
a popular song.

129
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:32,968
Do you have anything
by Prince...

130
00:04:33,036 --> 00:04:34,770
Wilhelm of Prussia?

131
00:04:34,838 --> 00:04:37,706
I have 16 million
songs, but, uh, no.

132
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:42,044
Just play the oldest,
stupidest thing in your catalog.

133
00:04:42,112 --> 00:04:44,113
Uh, let me check
my beeswax cylinders.

134
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,448
Uh, here we are.

135
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:49,551
♪ Come Josephine
in my flying machine! ♪

136
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:53,355
♪ Going up she goes,
up she goes ♪

137
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:56,358
♪ Balance yourself
like a bird on a beam ♪

138
00:04:56,426 --> 00:05:00,162
ALL: ♪ In the air she goes,
there she goes. ♪

139
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,864
(applause and cheering,
Mr. Burns chuckles)

140
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:05,501
May you all fly
in an aeroplane someday.

141
00:05:05,568 --> 00:05:07,736
You certainly seem to be
enjoying yourself, sir.

142
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:10,172
Indeed. That Homer Simpson
is the beating baboon heart

143
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,607
of this party.

144
00:05:11,674 --> 00:05:14,810
So he says, "Bigamy is having
one too many wives."

145
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:17,613
To which I replied,
"So's monogamy."

146
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,081
(laughter)

147
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:20,716
Oh, yeah!

148
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:22,951
I may have a use for
this Simpson character

149
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:24,553
higher up in the
organization.

150
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:26,255
Really? Well,
as safety inspector,

151
00:05:26,322 --> 00:05:28,657
he hasn't exactly
set the world on fire,

152
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:30,459
although he came close
several times.

153
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:31,927
(crow caws)

154
00:05:31,995 --> 00:05:33,495
Simpson, you're
probably wondering

155
00:05:33,563 --> 00:05:35,197
why you're here.

156
00:05:35,265 --> 00:05:36,465
It's never good.

157
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:38,500
I always wind up
being chased by hounds,

158
00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:40,169
or falling
through a trapdoor,

159
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:42,938
or being a peg in your game
of human croquet.

160
00:05:43,006 --> 00:05:45,374
When I made you a hoop,
you split your pants.

161
00:05:45,442 --> 00:05:48,010
Now, here at the plant, there's
no position more important

162
00:05:48,078 --> 00:05:50,479
than our accounts man,
who's responsible

163
00:05:50,547 --> 00:05:52,848
for glad-handing our
customers and suppliers.

164
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,284
I'd like you to take
over that position.

165
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:57,820
The last thing I understood
in that was "pants."

166
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,688
Just give me your answer,
and make it quick!

167
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:01,090
Our current account man,
Robert Marlowe here,

168
00:06:01,157 --> 00:06:02,825
is retiring at the
end of the month.

169
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:05,060
In two weeks, the only tie
I'll be wearing is

170
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:07,096
for autoerotic pleasure.

171
00:06:07,163 --> 00:06:09,631
Yes. Simpson,
only you have the bonhomie

172
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,567
and rotund charm
to replace him.

173
00:06:11,634 --> 00:06:14,937
It means a hefty expense account
and a corner office.

174
00:06:15,004 --> 00:06:17,106
Well, in that case...

175
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:20,609
Before you say yes, Simpson,
I feel it's my duty to warn you,

176
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:22,778
account men lose their soul.

177
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:24,980
Woo-hoo! No

So long, Sector 7-G.

180
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:34,744
Hello, Sector 22-F!

Uh.

186

The higher they rise,
the further they fall!

187
00:06:59,436 --> 00:07:01,504
You know,
you're kind of a downer.

188
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:02,839
I thought
you were retiring.

189
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:04,340
Why are you still here?

190
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:06,075
Hey, you're a
baby account man.

191
00:07:06,143 --> 00:07:07,577
Still on the bottle.

192
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:10,413
So, for my last good
deed before I retire,

193
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:12,415
I'm going to help you
persuade Mayor Quimby

194
00:07:12,483 --> 00:07:14,284
to sign off on a
nuclear rate hike.

195

with the mayor.

201

Aw. Bourbon go bye-bye.

204
00:07:36,774 --> 00:07:39,509
There ain't enough bourbon
in Kentucky for you, big guy.

205
00:07:39,577 --> 00:07:43,446
Yeah, the governor wrote me
a letter to that effect.

Wow, I can't believe

207
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,584
I'm eating steak
with the mayor.

The next time, I vote for
you, it's gonna be on purpose.

209
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,654
Much obliged.

210
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,223
Now, uh, where would you like

211
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,359

your proposed tax breaks?

Hey, Homer!

215
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:02,599
Look at you, man!

216
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,434

It's not what you think.

356
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:13,433
It's much weirder.

357
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:17,804
You're reading
a chapter book.

358
00:14:17,872 --> 00:14:19,139
For fun!

359
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:21,675
Bullies, to me.

360
00:14:21,743 --> 00:14:23,043
(both grunt)

361
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:25,412
Let's see the name
of this wedgie ticket.

362
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,113
(gulps)

363
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,681
<i>Little Women?</i>

364
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:30,584
Are you aware that's another way
of saying "girls"?

365
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:32,319
Look, I had to read it
to my sister.

366
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:34,688
Well, maybe
we should hear a little.

367
00:14:34,756 --> 00:14:37,457
And then maybe you'll be
hearing from <i>my</i> sisters.

368
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:39,726
Your fists
are sisters?

369
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:42,796
Yeah, Poke-ahontas
and Sock-ajawea!

370
00:14:42,864 --> 00:14:43,797
Nice save.

371
00:14:43,865 --> 00:14:46,199
Get reading.

372
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:49,403
"And Amy and Jo hugged
one another close,

373
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,140
and everything was forgotten
in one hearty kiss."

374
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:54,841
End of chapter eight.

375
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:56,109
You can't stop now.

376
00:14:56,177 --> 00:14:58,078
I want to know if their
father comes home.

377
00:14:58,146 --> 00:15:00,647
Does Jo learn to handle
her hasty temper?

378
00:15:00,715 --> 00:15:02,983
Does Amy get over
her conceitedness?

379
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:05,719
Aw, come on, guys,
it's getting dark.

380
00:15:05,787 --> 00:15:09,523
Okay, but you better be here
tomorrow after school.

381
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,491
'Cause we're going to
keep making you read us

382
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,993
a lame ol' girl's book.

383
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:15,295
(laughter)

384
00:15:15,363 --> 00:15:17,230
Bart needs to work
on differentiating

385
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:19,132
the character voices
a little better.

386
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,235
I know, I keep going,
"Why is Meg saying that?"

387
00:15:22,303 --> 00:15:24,338
and then I realize it's Beth.

388
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:25,572
(all agreeing)
That's right.

389
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,175
(Homer grunting)

390
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:30,177
(intercom buzzes)

391
00:15:30,244 --> 00:15:32,079
RECEPTIONIST:
Your wife is here, Mr. S.

392
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:35,015
(whispering loudly): Tell her
I'm at a meeting, not drinking.

393
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,818
This is
a whisper-amplifying intercom.

394
00:15:37,885 --> 00:15:39,419
- (screams)
- Homer, I want you to come

395
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:41,955
with me and the kids
on a family vacation.

396
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:43,056
Of course, of course.

397
00:15:43,124 --> 00:15:46,426
Family is everything
to us company men.

398
00:15:46,494 --> 00:15:49,262
Now, where shall we go
on your vacation?

399
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,898
The farthest thing from
this office I know:

400
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:52,899
rafting down Rattler
River Canyon.

401
00:15:56,237 --> 00:15:57,371
(whimpers)

402
00:15:57,438 --> 00:15:59,139
That's great--
let me run the numbers

403
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:01,041
'cause I really want
the Simpson account.

404
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:03,443
And give these cigars
to your children.

405
00:16:03,511 --> 00:16:06,079
Don't talk to me
like I'm a client.

406
00:16:06,147 --> 00:16:08,982
You're not a client,
you're <i>the</i> client.

407
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,417
(groans)

408
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:13,954
Simpson, put on your charm-
their-pants-off pants.

409
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:15,822
The mumpish oafs
in Washington are sending

410
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,291
their sternest band
of nuclear regulators,

411
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:20,293
handpicked to resist
all blandishment.

412
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:22,262
I'll handle it, I always do.

413
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,997
Rafting, eh?

414
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:26,032
It's a perfect way
to entertain them.

415
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,169
Finally, humanity has found
a use for water.

416
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:32,439
Mr. Burns, I can't go
rafting with you because--

417
00:16:32,507 --> 00:16:34,608
wait a minute,
could this all work?

418
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:41,481
Oh, no, you don't.

419
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:42,816
Coggily-doggily.

420
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:43,817
It all fits.

421
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:45,485
Mr. Burns, rafting it is.

422
00:16:45,553 --> 00:16:46,453
Excellent.

423
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:48,054
But Mr. S.,

424
00:16:48,122 --> 00:16:50,457
you just promised this week
to Mrs. S., Master B.,

425
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:51,958
and Mamselles L. and M.

426
00:16:52,026 --> 00:16:52,959
Now, relax, Dottie.

427
00:16:53,027 --> 00:16:55,595
Leave everything to me.

428
00:16:55,663 --> 00:16:56,897
(grunts)

429
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:01,940
Oh, Marge, this is
the most romantic trip

430
00:17:02,008 --> 00:17:03,875
you ever nagged me into.

431
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:05,977
And maybe
when we get home,

432
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:08,747
we can ride down
something else.

433
00:17:08,814 --> 00:17:10,649
Not sure what you're
going for, but...

434
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:11,783
(lusty growl)

435
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:14,452
(gasps)

436
00:17:16,455 --> 00:17:18,723
Uh, Marge, why don't I
catch us some salmon?

437
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,358
(grunting)

438
00:17:20,426 --> 00:17:21,860
D'oh!

439
00:17:21,928 --> 00:17:23,795
(grunting)

440
00:17:23,863 --> 00:17:25,363
It's about time.

441
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:28,366
We've been making small talk
about Mussolini for 15 minutes.

442
00:17:28,434 --> 00:17:30,869
Well, I, uh, found
that contact lens I was missing.

443
00:17:30,937 --> 00:17:32,637
Let me just screw her back in.

444
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:36,107
(pained grunting)

445
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:39,411
So, everybody good?

446
00:17:39,478 --> 00:17:43,348
Why did you get us...

447
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,784
It's more fun to play
with a ball of yarn

448
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:48,286
if it has all the colors in it.

449
00:17:48,354 --> 00:17:51,122
And yarn should be allowed
to marry dental floss.

450
00:17:58,097 --> 00:17:59,764
If you've got
that, then...

451
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,568
Are you sure
you're Martin Scorsese?

452
00:18:03,636 --> 00:18:04,703
(Homer grunts)

453
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,205
Enjoy the outdoors,
you stupid kid.

454
00:18:07,273 --> 00:18:08,373
(worried grunting)

455
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:09,874
This family time is so precious.

456
00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:11,509
Got to go.

457
00:18:11,577 --> 00:18:12,811
(panting)

458
00:18:12,878 --> 00:18:15,180
(murmurs suspiciously)

459
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:16,548
(grunting)

460
00:18:16,616 --> 00:18:17,882
(unzips, hums)

461
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,084
(zips up)

462
00:18:19,151 --> 00:18:20,418
(grunting)

463
00:18:20,486 --> 00:18:21,553
(grunts wearily)

464
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:23,388
Homer, I want
a Long Island ice tea,

465
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:25,657
America's most
complicated cocktail.

466
00:18:28,094 --> 00:18:29,461
Homer,

467
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:32,797
are you schmoozing those men?

468
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:34,299
(alarmed shriek)

469
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,067
Huh?

470
00:18:36,135 --> 00:18:38,637
Um, I think we're supposed
to get off here.

471
00:18:38,704 --> 00:18:40,171
Take us out first.

472
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:41,740
Anyone can start a family.

473
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:44,109
These days
no one can find a job.

474
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:46,778
Let's see, my family
gives me love and sex.

475
00:18:46,846 --> 00:18:48,446
My work gives me
money and sleep.

476
00:18:48,514 --> 00:18:50,482
Hurry, we're heading
for the falls!

477
00:18:52,585 --> 00:18:54,586
My coworkers are like a family,

478
00:18:54,654 --> 00:18:57,589
but in some ways
my family is like a family, too.

479
00:18:57,657 --> 00:19:00,992
For God's sakes, Homer,
I've given you three children.

480
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,827
Whose side are you on?

481
00:19:02,895 --> 00:19:06,931
Yours, Homie,
I'm always on yours.

482
00:19:11,737 --> 00:19:13,438
How ironic.

483
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:15,607
I survived the <i>Titanic</i>
by making a raft

484
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:18,576
out of steerage passengers,
and now this.

485
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:21,312
MARLOWE: Mr. Burns,
your heart will go on.

486
00:19:23,983 --> 00:19:25,350
(all screaming)

487
00:19:25,418 --> 00:19:27,819
Marlowe, I thought
you retired.

488
00:19:27,887 --> 00:19:29,587
I can't-- Treasury bills
are paying nothing.

489
00:19:29,655 --> 00:19:30,789
Nothing!

490
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:32,490
Well, Simpson,
you were willing

491
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:34,492
to let me go
over a waterfall,

492
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,561
but you cut operating expenses
by six percent,

493
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:37,796
so you're forgiven.

494
00:19:37,863 --> 00:19:39,030
Thanks.

495
00:19:39,098 --> 00:19:40,432
Now if you'll
excuse me,

496
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:42,901
I don't really like bourbon
or business talk,

497
00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:46,471
just good old
Simpson family fun.

498
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:47,906
Hey, kids, I'm it.

499
00:19:47,973 --> 00:19:49,474
(laughter)

500
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:53,378
(grunting)

501
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:54,379
Aah!

502
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:57,248
(screams)

503
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:02,253
I'm okay, and I
found some gold!

504
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:05,056
See, luckiest man
in the world.

505
00:20:06,225 --> 00:20:07,959
Oh, I'm so glad

506
00:20:08,027 --> 00:20:10,628
you're not an
accounts man anymore.

507
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:12,464
Yep, your worries
are over.

508
00:20:12,531 --> 00:20:15,133
I'm back to being
a boring old safety inspector

509
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:17,135
at a nuclear power plant.

510
00:20:17,203 --> 00:20:20,371
(both moaning)

511
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:26,742
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

512
00:21:14,426 --> 00:21:16,294
Shh!
