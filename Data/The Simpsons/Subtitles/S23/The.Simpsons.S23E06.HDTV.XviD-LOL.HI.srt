4
00:00:11,331 --> 00:00:14,427
Our journey begins
65 million years ago

5
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:17,999
when amazing creatures
took their first steps.

6
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:19,903
It's so cute that
all these children

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,609
are excited to see
their favorite dinosaurs.

00:00:22,677 --> 00:00:24,447

These aren't dinosaurs!

Oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh!

18
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:41,136
I paid $800 for five minutes!

19
00:00:41,204 --> 00:00:44,640
NARRATOR: The dinosaurs ruled the Earth
for millions of years,

20
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,177
until a massive asteroid
collided with the Earth,

21
00:00:47,244 --> 00:00:48,979
bringing their reign to an end.

22
00:00:49,047 --> 00:00:51,516

23
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,453

HOMER (singsongy):
Ex-tinct!

25
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,159
NARRATOR: So remember,
take good care of the Earth,

26
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:02,431
or we could suffer
the same fate as the dinosaurs.

27
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:04,935
Ooh, kids, did
you hear that lesson?

28
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:06,772
How is <i>that</i>
the lesson?

29
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,441
The point of
the dinosaurs is,

30
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:11,812
no matter what we do, an
asteroid's gonna wipe us out,

31
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:15,149
so we should party hard
and wreck the place!

32
00:01:15,217 --> 00:01:17,887
Yeah! Why should
the asteroid have all the fun!

33
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:19,156
(grunts)

34
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:24,197
What? They've
got a point.

35
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:25,298

Gift shop!
Gift shop!

37
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,379
All right, you can
each have one toy.

38
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:38,216
Lisa has a big toy.

39
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:40,818
No fair. That means
I get two small toys.

40
00:01:40,886 --> 00:01:42,987
No fair. This isn't
big, it's medium!

41
00:01:43,055 --> 00:01:46,058
No fair! Then I get four
small toys and Lisa gets

42
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,483
one medium and one small.

43
00:01:47,827 --> 00:01:49,895
What?! He gets four
and I only get two?

44
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:51,096
No fair!

45
00:01:51,164 --> 00:01:52,498
All right, that's it!
Forget it!

46
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:53,532
No toys for anyone!

47
00:01:56,804 --> 00:01:58,271
Okay, Maggie gets a toy.

48
00:01:58,338 --> 00:01:59,606
No fair!
No fair!

49
00:01:59,673 --> 00:02:01,475

Wait! Wait!
Come back!

54
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,924
Dad, follow that dinosaur!

55
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:16,491
I've waited my whole life
to hear that.

57
00:02:22,798 --> 00:02:24,498

59
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,902
Stegosaurus back plates,
used for either defense

60
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:30,338
or control of body temperature,
coming through!

61
00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:32,473

62
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:33,742
So tired.

63
00:02:33,809 --> 00:02:34,876

You're T.R. Francis!

69
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,521
You wrote

70
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:47,922
the Angelica Button books.

71
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,024
They're my favorite
fantasy novels.

72
00:02:50,092 --> 00:02:52,193
Um, yes, it's me,

73
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:55,497
the creator of your
beloved magical world,

74
00:02:55,565 --> 00:02:57,533
full of whimsy and, uh...

75
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:58,768
chapters.

76
00:02:58,836 --> 00:03:00,336
Now, off you go.
Bye-bye, now.

77
00:03:00,404 --> 00:03:02,640
But why are you working
at a dinosaur show?

78
00:03:02,707 --> 00:03:04,508
And why did you
run away from me?

79
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,477
And how did Angelica
get a new wand

80
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:09,080
after Baron Mortdeath burned
the Wandwood Forest? And...

81
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:11,016
Look, you seem
like a smart kid,

82
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:12,317
so here's the truth.

83
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:14,420
T.R. Francis isn't real.

84
00:03:14,488 --> 00:03:16,690
(laughs):
Of course you're real.

85
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:19,593
Everybody knows you got
the idea for this series

86
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:21,495
after an explosion
at a crumpet factory

87
00:03:21,563 --> 00:03:23,664
knocked you off
a double-decker bus.

88
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:25,733
How could <i>that</i> be made up?

89
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,168
I'm just an actress
they use for the jacket photo.

90
00:03:29,236 --> 00:03:32,203
That inspirational life story
is pure fiction.

91
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:34,304
Oh, I hate to break it to you,

92
00:03:34,372 --> 00:03:36,573
<i>but all the books you kids love</i>

93
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:38,675

<i>in executive boardrooms.</i>

94

<i>The plots are based</i>
<i>on market research,</i>

95
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:43,111
<i>and the pages are churned out</i>

96
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:45,980
<i>by a room full of</i>

97

<i>desperate for work.</i>

00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:52,551
<i>Publishers rake in the cash,</i>

Can I buy Lance Early?

108
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,910
I need to buy some
carbon-offset credits

109
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:23,946

Angelica Button books.

110

00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:30,250
But you liked the stories

So what does it matter?

114
00:04:31,652 --> 00:04:33,452
Doesn't it bother you
that Betty Crocker

115
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,854

would lie to their readers

easy million bucks?

00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,777
