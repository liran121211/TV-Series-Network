00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:20,180
No.

87
00:04:20,248 --> 00:04:22,416

How would you know?

99
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:45,472
I was Fatso's agent.

100
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,040
Annie Dubinsky.

101
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:50,210
If you ever hear a star's name
and wonder, is he dead?

102
00:04:50,278 --> 00:04:52,946
The answer is either
I represent him or yes.

103
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:55,365
Now, let me ask you something:
is there a place for

104
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:58,568
an old-fashioned lard-ass
like me on today's television?

105
00:04:58,636 --> 00:05:02,322
Um, would you play a
bloated corpse on <i>CSI?</i>

106
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,640
Would I?!

107
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,061
Wow, that's good
bloat work!

108
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:10,347
He always comes back
really religious.

109
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:14,651
You're killing me here
with this Catchy and Patchy.

110
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:16,453
I'm barely on my own show.

111
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:18,922
Today's kids are uncomfortable
with a clown

112
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,792
whose every reference they have
to look up on Wikipedia.

113
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:24,494
Wikipedia, Twitter--
who names these things?

114
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:26,062
Percy Dovetonsils?

115
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,131
(laughs)

116
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,599
Get it?

117
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:34,037
Come on, he was on Ernie Kovacs
with a smoking jacket...

118
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:36,139
Krusty,

119
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:38,241
we want to make some changes.

120
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:39,976
What kind of changes?

121
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:43,713
Krusty, um, this is never easy,

122
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:45,382
but you're fired.

123
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:47,050
Oh, that <i>was</i> easy.

124
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:48,418
Oh, no!

125
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:50,720
My contract states
there's only one way

126
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:52,322
you're allowed to fire me!

127
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,875
(drumroll)

128
00:05:54,942 --> 00:05:57,077
Yep, everything's
nice and legal!

129
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:01,298
(groans)

130
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:02,899
Could this be
more awkward?

131
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:09,039
They took my dressing room, my
parking space, even my writer,

132
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:11,007
so I don't have a
funny third item.

133
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:15,178
But at least I got you,
my agent and best friend.

134
00:06:15,246 --> 00:06:16,813
(sighs)

135
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:18,782
Krustila, I'm gonna
drop you as a friend first,

136
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,684
so that when I drop you
as a client,

137
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:22,052
you'll know it's only business.

138
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:23,887
But we shared everything!

139
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:26,156
Boats, girlfriends, condos.

140
00:06:26,224 --> 00:06:29,593
And when I finished, every one
of them was spic and span.

141
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,895
Krusty, I'm gonna prove
that it's over.

142
00:06:31,963 --> 00:06:33,997
What? I'm on
your garage door opener?

143
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:35,932
It's a smartphone,
you out-of-it hack.

144
00:06:37,802 --> 00:06:39,669
(groans)

145
00:06:42,356 --> 00:06:43,890
Little help?

146
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,943
This only shuts the door.

147
00:06:48,746 --> 00:06:52,249
So, what was everyone's
favorite moment at the museum?

148
00:06:52,316 --> 00:06:54,484
I liked the
knowledgeable docents.

149
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:56,820
I liked the early
closing time.

150
00:06:56,888 --> 00:06:58,188
(sobbing)

151
00:06:58,256 --> 00:06:59,256
Krusty?

152
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:01,992
Fate is so cruel.

153
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:05,779
This morning I was a star,
with a top agent.

154
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:08,548
Now I'm strung out
in a ball pit!

155
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:10,550
(sobbing)

156
00:07:10,618 --> 00:07:11,952
Go away.

157
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:14,988
No kid should see
his hero sunk so low.

158
00:07:15,056 --> 00:07:16,790
Well, you're not
exactly my hero.

159
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:18,625
I see you more as
a cautionary tale.

160
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:20,060
What?!

161
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:21,761
I'll show you
who's a cautionary tale.

162
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:23,129
(grunting)

163
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:25,332
I'll show everybody!

164
00:07:29,537 --> 00:07:30,470
You're not licked,
Krusty.

165
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:31,938
People love a comeback.

166
00:07:32,006 --> 00:07:34,608
Look at Robert Downey Jr.,
Mickey Rourke.

167
00:07:34,675 --> 00:07:37,010
I don't know if
I got it in me.

168
00:07:37,078 --> 00:07:38,845
Well, people also
love a quitter--

169
00:07:38,913 --> 00:07:40,747
Sarah Palin, The Beatles...

170
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:42,916
Eh, it's hopeless
without an agent.

171
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:44,117
You need an agent?

172
00:07:44,185 --> 00:07:45,785
We met a ten percenter today.

173
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:47,587
She'll get you meetings
with the eye,

174
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:49,189
the peacock,
the alphabet web.

175
00:07:49,257 --> 00:07:51,658
You'll have a skein on the sked
before you can say

176
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:54,861
"Krusty's wardrobe furnished by
Ha-Has of Beverly Hills."

177
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:56,496
A new agent?!

178
00:07:56,564 --> 00:07:57,647
I better freshen up.

179
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:01,618
(humming)

180
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:04,821
Also better get back on
those anti-psychotic meds.

181
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:06,823
(dog howling)

182
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:09,926
Oh, this is a bad sign.

183
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:11,962
I've been to classier
gas stations.

184
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:13,630
(laughs)

185
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:15,432
I know that laugh!

186
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:17,534
It's the laugh of
the most ungrateful,

187
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:19,035
credit-grabbing,

188
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:21,938
other-people's-room-service-
eating man that I ever met.

189
00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:25,675
I will never forgive you
for what you did to me.

190
00:08:25,743 --> 00:08:28,211
Krusty, you know her?

191
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:32,926
Ms. Dubinsky,
can you please just tell us

192
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:33,961
why you hate Krusty?

193
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:36,079
Come on in.

194
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:38,031
It's a long story.

195
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:40,117
(groans): Oh, now
I hate him, too.

196
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:42,035
It was the mid '60s.

197
00:08:42,103 --> 00:08:44,471
<i>I was a virgin agent,</i>

198
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:46,940
<i>looking for a first client</i>
<i>or a fourth husband.</i>

199
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:48,325
<i>And then I saw him.</i>

200
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:49,593
Hey-hey.

201
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,094
Scary world.

202
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:53,931
They start with the A-bomb,
then skip right to the H-bomb.

203
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:56,133
These geniuses can
blow up the planet,

204
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:57,551
but they don't know
the alphabet.

205
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:59,469
(laughter)

206
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:03,473
<i>I knew he could be big.</i>

207
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:05,142
<i>He just needed</i>
<i>some savvy fingers</i>

208
00:09:05,193 --> 00:09:07,995
<i>to mold his clay into an Ali.</i>

209
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:11,782
Herschel, you killed
them tonight!

210
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,985
(chuckles) There wasn't a
dry turtleneck in the house.

211
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:16,553
But mark my words:

212
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:18,555
the bohemian crowd
is small potatoes.

213
00:09:18,623 --> 00:09:20,457
You're gonna have to
broaden your act

214
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:22,226
if you want to play in Peoria.

215
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:23,760
I don't want
to play in Peoria.

216
00:09:23,828 --> 00:09:26,430
They're always doing
construction on Highway 74.

217
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:29,499
I mean, if you want to hit it
big, you got to lose this...

218
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:34,004
stick this on...

219
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:38,041
and make your comedy
a touch more physical.

220
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:39,343
How do I do that?

221
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,827
Like so.

222
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:42,729
(screaming)

223
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:47,267
(laughter)

224
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:48,402
(chuckles)

225
00:09:48,469 --> 00:09:49,770
Wow.

226
00:09:49,837 --> 00:09:52,656
This is the best kind of
comedy of all: cheap!

227
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:55,976
Herschel, you are gonna get
everything you want:

228
00:09:56,044 --> 00:09:57,494
money and women...

229
00:09:57,561 --> 00:09:59,162
There's only one
thing I want:

230
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,181
ice for my ding-dong!

231
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:02,749
And you.

232
00:10:02,817 --> 00:10:05,252
<i>Every night, he had them</i>
<i>rolling in the aisles,</i>

233
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:07,521
<i>followed by a roll</i>
<i>in the hey-hey with me.</i>

234
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:16,980
This is the part where I get
the kids out of the room.

235
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:18,382
Oh, grow up.

236
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:21,351
Today's kids are less sensitive
than an army condom.

237
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:24,621
They see more on TV than my
mother did on her wedding night.

238
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:27,357
And they don't complain about it
for the next 50 years.

239
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:30,694
I got big plans
for us, Krusty.

240
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:32,296
This is just
the beginning.

241
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:34,564
Actually, sweetheart,
it's the end.

242
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:37,668
I'm leaving you for Ron
Rabinowitz at United Parasites.

243
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:40,070
You waited until now
to tell me that?!

244
00:10:40,138 --> 00:10:42,606
I can only tell the truth
right after sex.

245
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:44,875
But all during sex
I was thinking it.

246
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:45,976
Get out!

247
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:47,844
(groans)

248
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:49,947
You ungrateful pig!

249
00:10:50,014 --> 00:10:51,815
I made you!

250
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:54,818
Deep down, I'm doing this
to get back at my father.

251
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:56,186
Don't blame
this on me.

252
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:57,921
Your childhood
was heaven.

253
00:10:57,972 --> 00:10:59,373
(groans)

254
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,108
I was so mad at him

255
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:03,710
I didn't have sex with a clown
for five months.

256
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:04,878
What about mimes?

257
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:06,847
Come on.
I'm not made of stone.

258
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:11,118
Annie, would you ever consider
taking Krusty back as a client?

259
00:11:11,185 --> 00:11:14,121
No! Absolutely not!

260
00:11:14,188 --> 00:11:16,590
Trust with me is
like a candle.

261
00:11:16,658 --> 00:11:19,259
When you blow it out,
it's gone for good.

262
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:20,894
What about a comedy candle?

263
00:11:20,962 --> 00:11:23,263
You know, that relights itself?

264
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:25,098
I don't find those funny,
just frustrating.

265
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,300
They're pretty funny.

266
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:27,801
Once, I used one on Milhouse.

267
00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:30,103
He was wishing for his parents
to get back together,

268
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:31,505
but the flame never went out.

269
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:32,673
(blows raspberry, laughs)

270
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,391
(chuckles)
Good one, boy.

271
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:37,394
Annie, I'm down on
my rebuilt knee.

272
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:40,030
Can't you forgive me?
Please?

273
00:11:40,098 --> 00:11:42,566
For the sake of me
getting what I want?

274
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:48,305
(chuckles) Fine.
But no nonsense.

275
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:49,740
Except, of course,
during working hours,

276
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:51,408
then it's all nonsense.

277
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,810
Great. So we're booked

278
00:11:53,878 --> 00:11:57,014
for three weeks in June
at the Springfield Playhouse.

279
00:11:57,081 --> 00:12:00,717
I promise you Krusty will show
up on time or sober.

280
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:03,020
Yeah, that's right, I said "or."

281
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:05,105
Let me get this straight:

282
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:07,474
you want me
to do my kids' show for adults?

283
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:10,043
They're gonna want F-bombs and
all I can give 'em is

284
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,845
"ca-ca" and "ta-tas."

285
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:15,248
Krusty, there is nothing people
love more than the things

286
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:16,483
they loved when they were kids.

287
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:19,252
So you re-create
your show for adults!

288
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,488
It worked like magic
for Pee-Wee Herman

289
00:12:21,556 --> 00:12:23,023
after his setback.

290
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:24,758
What did he get in trouble for?

291
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:26,727
(whispering)

292
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:27,961
That's all?!

293
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:30,430
I did that while
you were on the phone!

294
00:12:35,136 --> 00:12:37,037
You know, I'm
a little nervous

295
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:39,039
about doing
live theater again.

296
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:41,341
Come on. Didn't you do
your TV show in front

297
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:42,876
of an audience
for years?

298
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:45,679
Yeah, but they were kids and we
gave 'em candy if they laughed.

299
00:12:45,747 --> 00:12:46,847
And if they didn't,

300
00:12:46,914 --> 00:12:49,483
until the '70s,
I hit 'em with a stick.

301
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,918
Some jerk tracked down the kids
and made a documentary.

302
00:12:51,986 --> 00:12:54,254
It's called <i>Circus of Shame</i>
or something.

303
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:55,956
(drum roll)

304
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:58,325
And now, let's welcome a man

305
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:03,730
the Spanish call "Señor No-Fun":
Krusty the Clown!

306
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:05,866
(cheers)
Hey-hey, kids!

307
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:07,768
ALL:
Hey-hey, Krusty!

308
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:09,936
Who here likes nostalgia?

309
00:13:10,004 --> 00:13:11,238
(all cheer)

310
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:13,340
Everything's perfect
about the past

311
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:15,041
except how it led
to the present.

312
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:18,995
Then welcome back the original
Tick-Tock the Clock!

313
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:21,481
Would that I could
turn back time

314
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:23,784
and never play this
career-killing role.

315
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:29,122
Ooh, looks like Tick-Tock is
telling us it's time for...

316
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,925
ALL:
What's In Krusty's Pocket?!

317
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:34,361
Mmm. Ah!

318
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:36,396
(chuckles)

319
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:41,001
(cheering)

320
00:13:44,872 --> 00:13:47,374
I've pulled out everything
but my Little Krusty.

321
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:50,377
Aw, what the heck?

322
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:51,812
(audience laughs)

323
00:13:54,515 --> 00:13:56,183
Oh, that was great, man!

324
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:58,468
I feel like I'm
ten again!

325
00:13:58,536 --> 00:14:00,287
Everything I loved
as a kid

326
00:14:00,354 --> 00:14:03,089
and hated as a teenager
I love as an adult!

327
00:14:03,157 --> 00:14:05,008
No one knows better
than me

328
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:07,644
that it's "Here today,
gone tomorrow."

329
00:14:07,712 --> 00:14:10,380
But I'm here today!

330
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:12,282
Thanks to you, honey!

331
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,251
BOTH:
Mmm... mwa!

332
00:14:14,318 --> 00:14:15,919
Uh, um, sorry...

333
00:14:15,987 --> 00:14:17,721
This one, I think,
is mine.

334
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:19,089
Yeah, I'll take that...

335
00:14:19,157 --> 00:14:20,190
I'll, give me
that one.

336
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:21,691
Well, that looks
better on you, honey.

337
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,393
Yeah.
No, no, no, it screams you.

338
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:24,427
Let's just keep smooching

339
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:26,396
till everything sorts
itself out.

340
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:27,430
Mmm... I'm done.

341
00:14:29,014 --> 00:14:32,066
Krusty, you're getting
the best reviews of your career!

342
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:34,696
Yep! I'm back on top!

343
00:14:34,763 --> 00:14:38,600
And this time I'm not blowing it
on cocaine for my horses.

344
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:41,736
They start well, then they get
paranoid around the third turn.

345
00:14:41,804 --> 00:14:43,872
And you'll have plenty
to invest.

346
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:46,140
The networks have
come crawling.

347
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,709
Which ones? Telebozo?

348
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:50,311
Shtick at Nite? E.S.P.U.?

349
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:51,980
Better, baby.

350
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:54,048
Our premium cable network is
a little different

351
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:55,617
from what you're used to.

352
00:14:55,684 --> 00:14:57,752
Our brand is classy
and upscale.

353
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,855
And we pay for everything
with soft porno and boxing.

354
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:03,858
Wait a minute.
There's <i>soft</i> porno?

355
00:15:03,926 --> 00:15:05,827
And here you don't have
to worry about budgets,

359
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,635
And that will be the end
of that phoenix.

360
00:15:13,702 --> 00:15:17,689
All good. I just have one
non-negotiable demand:

361
00:15:17,756 --> 00:15:21,726
This brass begonia here is
my producer now

362
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:24,012
until the end of time.

363
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,613
Really?
Yep.

364
00:15:25,681 --> 00:15:28,082
And you know
that anything said

365
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,452

can be taken to the bank.

you finally hit it big.

You said it!

No, no, no!

What, are you crazy?!

You can't put

sad old man!

00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:18,199
Scream something nice.

00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:21,068
Krusty, I am here to serve
you and no one else.

"Nice" gets booked

Hey, birthday parties got me
through some tough times.

388
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:29,794
For years I lived on
piñata candy!

389
00:16:29,862 --> 00:16:32,964
Yeah? Well, from now on
the only birthday parties

390
00:16:33,032 --> 00:16:34,966
you are gonna do are
for the insane sons

391
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:37,001
of rich Middle Eastern
dictators.

392
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:38,903
Your going rate is 100
barrels of oil.

393
00:16:38,971 --> 00:16:41,272
Whoa, that's Beyoncé volume.

Wait one hairy, banana-peeling,
scene-stealing minute here!

00:16:57,006 --> 00:16:58,039
Wha...?
What'd I do?

399
00:16:58,107 --> 00:16:59,741
Whose show is this?
Huh? Huh?!

400
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:01,209
Whose name is on
that sign?!

(chatters)

402
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:05,046
Yeah, that's right,
little buddy boy!

403
00:17:05,114 --> 00:17:06,180
Krusty! Krusty!

404
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:08,583
And don't you ever
upstage him

405
00:17:08,651 --> 00:17:10,852
or craft service will be
serving chimp tacos!

406
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:12,070
(drooling)

407
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:14,372
Yeah, I'd like to squeeze
a lime on that!

408
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,323

00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:18,626
(whimpering)

410
00:17:18,694 --> 00:17:20,862
Now apologize to Krusty!

411

412
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:25,767
(hushed):
Not so hard.

413
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:27,835
She'll know
we have a past.

414
00:17:27,903 --> 00:17:29,988
What's going on,
yanking me out of my <i>schvitz?!</i>

415
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:31,973
I look like an unwrapped mummy.

416
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,375
Ooh! Idea for sketch:
rapping mummy.

417
00:17:34,443 --> 00:17:36,511
Notorious T-U-T.
It writes itself.

418
00:17:36,578 --> 00:17:37,945
Find someone to write it.

419
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:39,080
Where's Annie?

420
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:40,832
Annie is what we need
to discuss.

421
00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:42,400
She's out of control.

422
00:17:42,468 --> 00:17:44,969
She called a network
vice president "unhip."

423
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:47,488
And he reads <i>GQ</i>
and he's straight.

424
00:17:47,556 --> 00:17:49,590
And recently
we had this incident.

425
00:17:49,658 --> 00:17:52,593
(gasping) Wait!
What are you doing?!

426
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:53,978
She claimed this intern

427
00:17:54,046 --> 00:17:55,813
sharpened her pencil
"too pointy."

428
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:59,250
Oh, I see what's
going on here:

429
00:17:59,318 --> 00:18:01,719
if a woman does it,
she's a bitch.

430
00:18:01,787 --> 00:18:04,455
But in a man, those traits would
be considered...

431
00:18:04,523 --> 00:18:05,306
Uh-oh!

432
00:18:05,357 --> 00:18:06,557
(gasping)

433
00:18:06,642 --> 00:18:08,743
(tires squeal)

434
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:11,763
That hallway looks
familiar.

435
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,548
I'm only getting
college credit for this!

436
00:18:13,615 --> 00:18:14,632
(crash)
My legs!

437
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,533
(groans)

438
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:19,749
Wow, I can't believe
we're in the audience

439
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,218
of a pay-cable show!

440
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:25,456
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Krusty's favorite part

441
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:28,426
of the taping: talking to the
audience before the show.

442
00:18:28,493 --> 00:18:31,345
Hey-how-are-ya-don't-talk-to-me
-the-show's-starting.

443
00:18:31,413 --> 00:18:32,914
(all muttering)

444
00:18:32,998 --> 00:18:37,885
And now... the clown
that never lets you down...

445
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:42,456
Krusty the... Clown!

446
00:18:44,676 --> 00:18:47,712
Hey, hey, premium cable
subscribers! (applause)

447
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:52,083
Tonight we've got the cast of
the hit <i>Boardwalk Vampire!</i>

448
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,785
We've also got Janeane Garofolo.

449
00:18:54,853 --> 00:18:56,153
Wait a minute!

450
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:58,723
We have very specific
language in our contract

451
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:02,360
saying "No guests who are
funnier than Krusty."

452
00:19:02,427 --> 00:19:05,229
Janeane has promised to be
strictly angry and polemical.

453
00:19:05,297 --> 00:19:07,698
And I'll keep my promise,
like Obama did with Guantanamo.

454
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:09,166
(cheers, applause)

455
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:12,370
Oh! That's funnier
than I can ever hope to be!

456
00:19:12,437 --> 00:19:15,206
Sorry, Janeane.
Grab some shrimp and go.

457
00:19:15,274 --> 00:19:17,708
You can fill
your stupid beret once.

458
00:19:17,776 --> 00:19:21,195
Burn on you! I brought
my expandable beret!

459
00:19:21,263 --> 00:19:22,647
(audience cheers)

460
00:19:22,714 --> 00:19:24,665
Krusty, this is
exactly the kind of meddling

461
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,667
that only we're allowed to do.

462
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:28,286
Fire her as we discussed!

463
00:19:28,353 --> 00:19:29,754
Don't make us
threaten you.

464
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:31,489
Krusty?!

465
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:32,757
What did you tell them?

466
00:19:32,824 --> 00:19:35,126
Oh, I, I did that laugh
that people interpret

467
00:19:35,193 --> 00:19:36,160
any way they want.

468
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:38,562
(laughs nervously)

469
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,831
I thought that laugh meant
"I love you."

470
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:43,067
It can...

471
00:19:43,135 --> 00:19:44,669
Well, there's no room
for waffling anymore.

472
00:19:44,736 --> 00:19:46,604
You're with me
forever or never.

473
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:47,622
Which is it?

474
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:49,790
What, uh, when you said...

475
00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:51,292
(laughs nervously)

476
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,960
I'm paying extra
for this channel?

477
00:19:53,028 --> 00:19:55,429
Hasn't been good since
<i>The Wire.</i> Ah, who am I kidding?

478
00:19:55,497 --> 00:19:56,897
I never watched <i>The Wire.</i>

479
00:19:56,965 --> 00:19:59,500
Had to bluff my way through
so many conversations.

480
00:19:59,568 --> 00:20:00,801
Well, Annie,

481
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:04,588
I think you know my answer.

482
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:09,477
Wow, Krusty, adjusting
for age, that was amazing!

483
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:12,079
Hey, hey.
And the best thing is

484
00:20:12,147 --> 00:20:16,133
I kept my word
and I got a new show.

485
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:19,203
<i>Sex over 60:</i> <i>The Mechanics</i>
<i>of the Impossible.</i> Take two!

486
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:27,041

Can I open my eyes?

487
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:31,303
(chuckle)
Hey, come on, wake up.
