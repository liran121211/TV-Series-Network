Tomb of the Unknown Mascot...

45
00:02:14,308 --> 00:02:17,994
Aw... That's so sad.
And as entertainers,

46
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:20,763
it is our solemn duty to cheer
them up for a little while.

47
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:22,598
Gaga, it's my job
to keep you away from

48
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,133
ugly bumps on the map
like Springfield.

49
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:26,385
Don't worry, we'll get you
right on a plane.

50
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:29,338
No! Don't you remember what
happened at LaGuardia?

51
00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:34,377

52
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:36,345
Yeah, well, uh, you
missed your flight.

53

63
00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:08,528
"Popularity Awards," the awards
voted by students,

64
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:09,929
in judgment of their peers.

65
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:14,133

BART: Call back.

76
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:36,539
I fail to see
the honor in this.

77
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,841
Aren't awards shows
rather silly?

78
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:41,360
What?! Without awards shows,
how would I know what movie

79
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:44,780
has the best beheading,
or that <i>Glee</i> is a comedy?

80
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:47,984
And now the award for
Least Popular Student.

81
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:49,619
Lisa Simpson!

82
00:03:49,686 --> 00:03:50,887
What?

83
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:52,588

85
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,091
I gotta go.

86
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:56,626
You probably should
accept it, Lisa.

87
00:03:56,693 --> 00:03:58,160
They'll go easier
on you if you do.

88
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:02,832

89
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,867

92
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:10,773
You said they'd
take it easy on me.

93
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:12,308
I know very little
about children.

94
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:17,380
We've got to cheer up
a whole town.

95
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:20,232
Where's the dress I wore
when I met the Pope?

96
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,803
It's nice, but I saw
Jennifer Lopez wearing it.

97
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,471
Burn it. Burn it now.

98

I just want my life back!

101
00:04:31,194 --> 00:04:33,279
No negativity!
Oh, you're right.

102
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:36,065
I'm missing a terrible winter!

103
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:41,003
And that's how Berber carpet
got its name according to some.

104
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:42,672
Lisa, how was your day?

105
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:45,041
Um, can I be excused
from holding up

106
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:46,575
my end of the conversation?

107
00:04:46,643 --> 00:04:47,877
What's wrong with her?

108
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:49,712
She just found out
no one likes her.

109
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,213
(loud whisper):
I thought she knew.

110
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:53,950
Hey, Lisa, maybe you'd
feel a little better

111
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:57,720
if you read the Daily Fourth
Gradian Message Board, huh?

"Lisa doesn't judge
other people.

119
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:17,289
Why should we judge her?"
It's signed, "Truth Teller."

120
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:20,426
Whoever this "Truth Teller" is,
I'm a fan.

121
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:23,863
It takes a lot of courage to
post nice things anonymously.

122
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,932
You know, it seems like
more than a coincidence

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,002
that Milhouse brought it
to our attention. Hm?

124
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,672
(chuckles) Well, I certainly
wish I was Truth Teller.

125
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:36,208
But if I was, you'd know,
because I can't keep a secret.

126
00:05:36,276 --> 00:05:38,911
I sleep under my bed every night
'cause I'm scared

127
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:42,148

If gasoline is their food,

then why do they have teeth?!

129
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:51,340
So, Lisa, I guess you're not
as unpopular as we thought.

130
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:53,609
Yep. Message boards
are never wrong.

131
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:56,679

BOTH: Double Dutch.

Forgive a fool her tears.

the parents are divorced.

where Lady Gaga's
fabulous freighter

176
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:49,926
has bumped and grinded
its way into town.

177
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:51,628
Suffice it to say,
this is the most

178
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:54,063
culturally significant train
to stop here since

179
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:57,734
the McKinley funeral cortege
paused to pick up casket ice.

180
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,340
Now, sweetie, don't make
a big deal out of this.

181
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:07,110
I stopped reading
after "Top Student."

182
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:09,445
Want to honk your jazz tube?

183
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:12,015
Oh, what is the point?

184
00:08:12,082 --> 00:08:14,317
I think this is the end of me.

185
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:16,386
All I had was my integrity.

186
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:17,920
And now that's gone.

187
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:21,658
(sobbing): I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry.

188
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:25,061
I try not to cry
till you're asleep.

189
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,964
I appreciate that.
(groans)

190
00:08:28,032 --> 00:08:31,034
(sobbing): Look, if I could
just spend a few days

191
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:33,903
in my room without anyone
trying to cheer me up,

192
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,489
I think I might
have a chance to...

193
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,324
Hey, why don't we
go see Lady Gaga?

194
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,326
That'll turn your
frown upside down.

195
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,730
It's not a frown. It is a
straight line of resignation.

196
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:46,032
Looks just the same
upside down.

197
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,935
What are you talking about?
Y-You're right!

198
00:08:49,003 --> 00:08:51,504
Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!

199
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:55,174
Dad, if you really want to help,
please stop trying to help.

200
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:58,011
I will, but you know me
and my crazy number thing

201
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:00,179
where I always have
to get to 17.

202
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:02,248
Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!
Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!

203
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:03,566
Voop! Voop! Voop!

204
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:05,601
Whoops, I lost count.
Better start again.

205
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:06,886
Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!

want to be here.

What's wrong, honey?

260
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:44,494
Please, I've had enough
attention for one day!

261
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:48,164
Yo, lighting! I can't see the
girl who's had enough attention.

262
00:11:51,134 --> 00:11:53,169
We should go to
your house and talk.

263
00:11:53,237 --> 00:11:54,937
Incognito!

264
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:55,838
Oh, God.

00:11:57,241 --> 00:11:59,976
Psst! It's me, Gaga.

266
00:12:00,043 --> 00:12:01,861
But no one must know.

267
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,263
HOODIE VOICE CHIP (monotone):
Gaga. Gaga. Gaga.

268
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:08,734
So peaceful. Just the buzzing
of the paparazzi.

269
00:12:08,802 --> 00:12:10,836
(cameras snapping)

270
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:12,605
Hey, Gary.
How's your wife and kids?

271
00:12:12,673 --> 00:12:14,874
Still ashamed of me.
Big smile!

272
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,642
This is where I live.

273
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,778
Well, hello.

274
00:12:18,845 --> 00:12:20,913
It's one of those
music industry superstars

275
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:23,673
who's turning our innocent
children into ladies of the night.

276
00:12:23,674 --> 00:12:25,744
What sweater drawer
did you crawl out of?

277
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:28,554
(chuckles): Name's Ned Flanders,
I've heard of you.

278
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,824
Haven't seen so much skin since
shedding season on a snake farm.

279
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:34,393
But all I'm saying is that
everyone is beautiful...

280
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:36,762
Yes, but Jesus said that...

281
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,631
pretty much the same thing.

282
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:41,100
Darn it, the Bible said
the Devil would be attractive.

283
00:12:41,168 --> 00:12:43,069
What makes you think
I'm the Devil?

284
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:48,674
Unless you're gonna slap some
wieners on those, turn 'em off.

285
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:52,111
Joke's on you; I needed a trim.

286
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:59,919
(Gaga groaning)

287
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,254
Bastards!

288
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:04,156
Lisa, look at me.

289
00:13:04,224 --> 00:13:07,243
So what if your number one
supporter is you.

290
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:08,761
That's how it should be.

291
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,163
I had some very
tough times myself

292
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:13,699
before I became
a superstar at age 22.

293
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:16,869
Everything is gonna
be fine. You better yet?

294
00:13:16,937 --> 00:13:20,206
(phone chimes)
Sorry, gotta answer this text.

295
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:21,774
Please, take your time.

296
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,144
You know what you need?

297
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:27,513
Solitude?
Flash mob!

298
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:33,886
Now, Lisa, if that didn't
fundamentally change

299
00:13:33,954 --> 00:13:37,523
who you are,
I don't know what.

300
00:13:42,663 --> 00:13:45,131
You idiots!
She meant we should disperse.

301
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,370
Lisa, you un-tattooed
little miracle,

302
00:13:51,438 --> 00:13:55,641
I'm not leaving here until I
restore your sense of hope.

303
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:59,645
Let me explain. I have a chance
for a grim but tolerable life,

304
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,781
but only if I give up hope.

305
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:04,650
Now if you don't mind,
and with all due worship,

306
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,752
I would like to be alone.

307
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,822
Lady Gaga, meet your biggest
threat: Baby Googoo.

308
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:14,377
Can I please be alone?

309
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:28,324
Well, it worked once.

310
00:14:32,513 --> 00:14:35,114
So, any ideas about Lisa?
(sighs)

311
00:14:35,182 --> 00:14:38,234
I never have any idea
what to do for Lisa.

312
00:14:38,302 --> 00:14:41,070
To be the mother of someone
who's so smart

313
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:45,224
and so sensitive and who
beautifully plays an instrument

314
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:47,660
(sotto voice):
I don't really care for,

315
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:49,929
(sobbing): it's so hard.

316
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,799
I wish I was one of those

317
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:54,968
young women who could
just wave their hands

318
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:56,836
in front
of their eyes and not cry,

319
00:14:56,904 --> 00:14:58,738
because it doesn't
work for me.

320
00:14:58,806 --> 00:15:00,206
(yells)
Marge...

321
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,641
(yells)
Ah...

322
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:03,409
Ooh! Aah! Ooh!
Marge. Marge.

323
00:15:03,477 --> 00:15:04,377
Marge.
Hm...

324
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,346
Marge, take it easy.
(groans)

325
00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:08,181
It's just human contact.

326
00:15:08,248 --> 00:15:11,651
I'm afraid handholding
isn't going to cheer me up.

327
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:13,419
Well, maybe this will.

328
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,608
Homer!

329
00:15:18,676 --> 00:15:20,209
Wow. Wow.

330
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:23,713
This is like the night Hillary
won the New Hampshire Primary.

331
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,084
Lisa snuck out.

332
00:15:28,152 --> 00:15:29,952
I'm going after her.
(Homer grunting)

333
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,689
What are you gonna say?
HOMER: Whoo! Mm.

334
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:34,574
I'll just tell her that...

335
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,242
Stop it, Homer!

336
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,861
Some of that meat is me.
Can I just trim the hem?

337
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:40,529
(groans) It's yours.

338
00:15:44,752 --> 00:15:46,786
Oh, good. She's playing.

339
00:15:46,854 --> 00:15:49,689
Not so good.
It's "Lisa Roulette."

340
00:15:49,757 --> 00:15:51,491
(kids shouting)
Don't let her get you!

341
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,428
Her eyes shoot loser lasers!

342
00:15:55,512 --> 00:15:56,712
(feigns gasping last breath)

343
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:01,384
(chanting):
There is no over-the-top.

344
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:02,852
There is no over-the-top.

345
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:04,537
Run!

346
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:08,408
With an egg that big, there's
gotta be an even bigger chicken!

347
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,128
Lisa?

348
00:16:12,196 --> 00:16:15,064
Lisa, listen to me.

349
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:18,167
This pity party's being shut
down by the smile police.

350
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:20,002
Here's what
you're gonna do.

351
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,205
Why do you keep telling me
what I'm gonna do?

352
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,906
This isn't about me.

353
00:16:23,974 --> 00:16:25,564
Well, who else
would it be about?

354
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:26,509
You!

355
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,946
It's about
"Hello, hello, Springfield."

356
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:32,048
"It's me, Gaga!"

357
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,184
"Why is everyone looking
at my purple hair

358
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:36,686
full of bluebirds?"

359
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,556
Well, I denounce thee!
Wha...?

360
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,191
I denounce thee for
giving people ambitions

361
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:43,926
they cannot fulfill.

362
00:16:43,994 --> 00:16:45,595
And I denounce thee
for positing a world

363
00:16:45,662 --> 00:16:49,165
where social acceptance
and walking on heels are easy!

364
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:51,768
Please, may we kill the kid?

365
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:54,053
I denounce thee!
I denounce thee!

366
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:55,471
I denounce thee!

367
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:58,174
Whoa, easy, little monster.

368
00:16:58,242 --> 00:17:00,610
Don't "monster" me.

369
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:01,611
(all gasp)

370
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,880
Whatever you say.

371
00:17:03,947 --> 00:17:05,248
(sobbing)

372
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:09,952
Are you crying... glitter?

373
00:17:10,003 --> 00:17:11,404
Tiny diamonds.
(sobs)

374
00:17:11,472 --> 00:17:13,306
Hurts like hell.

375
00:17:13,373 --> 00:17:16,375
(chanting):
Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga...

376
00:17:18,398 --> 00:17:21,600
HOMER: Okay Lisa, coming up
to make things better!

377
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:24,503
(grunting):
Okay, I'm almost there.

378
00:17:24,571 --> 00:17:26,638
Upward, ever upward.

379
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:28,407
(panting):
Stay hydrated...

380
00:17:28,474 --> 00:17:30,609
Oh, I'm on the wrong tree!

381
00:17:30,677 --> 00:17:32,878
(grunts)
Okay, try again.

382
00:17:32,946 --> 00:17:34,880
Here we go, okay.

383
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:37,516
(grunting and panting):
Oh... Lisa, can you come down?

384
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:42,538
Sweetie, I've been thinking.

385
00:17:42,605 --> 00:17:44,873
Now, this all started
because you used a fake name

386
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:47,209
to defend yourself.

387
00:17:47,277 --> 00:17:49,711
The problem's not
that you were cheating.

388
00:17:50,813 --> 00:17:53,015
It's that you got caught.

389
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:57,653
I cheat on my diet,
but nobody knows

390
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,222
'cause the damage
is on the inside,

391
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,724
and the first warning sign
is sudden death.

392
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:04,593
So, honey, what do you say?

393
00:18:04,661 --> 00:18:06,795
Dad, thank you!

394
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:09,147
Like always, the fact
that I could tune you out

395
00:18:09,232 --> 00:18:11,316
without fearing I'd miss out
on something

396
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:13,502
gave me the time
to take stock and realize

397
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,637
how ungrateful I have been.

398
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:18,640
Which means, I've got
a train to catch.

399
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,159
(chuckling): Parenting.

400
00:18:21,227 --> 00:18:25,197
It's the one job you know
you're always doing right.

401
00:18:25,265 --> 00:18:28,967
So long, Springfield.
You are my Waterloo.

402
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:30,836
(crowd cheers)

403
00:18:30,904 --> 00:18:34,573
And now I'm just going to lie
in bed and eat Fruit Roll-Ups.

404
00:18:34,641 --> 00:18:37,142
Why is she doing in defeat
what I do in victory?

405
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,577
(whistle blowing)

406
00:18:38,645 --> 00:18:40,479
(chugging)

407
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:42,965
Gaga!

408
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:43,966
Lisa?

409
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:45,300
Why are you here?

410
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:46,635
To thank you.

411
00:18:46,686 --> 00:18:47,669
For what?

412
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,671
Look at me!
You did help me

413
00:18:49,722 --> 00:18:52,024
by allowing me to
inappropriately focus

414
00:18:52,108 --> 00:18:54,810
eight years of rage
and rejection on you.

415
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:57,095
It was like a great sneeze.

416
00:18:57,163 --> 00:18:59,064
And now I can say
what's good about me.

417
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:01,500
And I can say it
as Lisa Simpson!

418
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:03,702
(gently): Just not that loud.
Go ahead.

419
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,888
Well, I am smart,
nice, tolerant, funny

420
00:19:06,956 --> 00:19:08,957
but not "mean funny," and I
never forget a birthday,

421
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:10,759
even for kids who move away.

422
00:19:10,827 --> 00:19:12,461
Now, Lisa, there's
only one last thing

423
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:14,546
you have to do to
be a Little Monster.

424
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:16,865
I'll do anything but sing.

425
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,935
