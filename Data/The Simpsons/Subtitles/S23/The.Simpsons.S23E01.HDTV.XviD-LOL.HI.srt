00:00:01,041 --> 00:00:02,240
Good evening.

2
00:00:02,265 --> 00:00:04,781
Tonight we reveal to you
the fate of Nedna.

3
00:00:04,806 --> 00:00:07,746
I have devoted my summer
to a more meaningful task

4
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:10,670
salvaging
Mr. Popper's Penguins online.

5
00:00:10,908 --> 00:00:12,976
Anyway...the answer
to Ned and Edna

6
00:00:13,044 --> 00:00:15,414
is carefully hidden
in tonight's episode,

7
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:18,252
like a bread crumb
lodged inside my stomach crease.

8
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:19,855
Enjoy.

10
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:23,820

What the...?

15
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:36,031
Aha!

00:01:23,863 --> 00:01:25,564
(laughs)

35
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:28,134
While I'm here,
I might as well pre-punch out.

37
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:33,637
Hmm, we've had
a lot of bills lately.

38
00:01:33,638 --> 00:01:35,138
Better put in some overtime.

39
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,442
(chuckles)

40
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,843
(humming)

41
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:43,379
Larry, my man!

42
00:01:43,446 --> 00:01:45,047
Hey, you're
not Larry.

43
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:46,081
How come you're
not Larry?

44
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:47,782
I wouldn't know, sir.

45
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,319
Uh, listen,
if you could indulge me,

46
00:01:51,387 --> 00:01:53,854
Larry and I fist-bump
every morning.

47
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:54,855
Like that.

48
00:01:54,923 --> 00:01:56,623
The warmth of human contact

49
00:01:56,691 --> 00:01:58,458
with a manly whiff of violence.

50
00:01:58,526 --> 00:01:59,626
Eh?

51
00:01:59,693 --> 00:02:01,527
Not interested.

52
00:02:01,595 --> 00:02:02,595
Wha...?!

53
00:02:02,662 --> 00:02:04,296
Sheesh!

54
00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:06,230
Hey, what's with that
new security guard?

55
00:02:06,298 --> 00:02:07,665
He's acting
all aloof.

56
00:02:07,732 --> 00:02:10,501
Uh, by the way, that's my
word of the day: "he's."

57
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:12,502
Maybe I was
a little hard on him,

58
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,671
expecting him to be Larry
right away.

59
00:02:14,738 --> 00:02:16,239
By the way, where is Larry?

60
00:02:16,306 --> 00:02:17,806
Crazy house.
Violent ward.

61
00:02:17,874 --> 00:02:19,374
Good ol' Larry.

62
00:02:19,442 --> 00:02:20,542
(humming)

63
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,544
Say... Wayne,

64
00:02:22,611 --> 00:02:24,112
I couldn't help but notice

65
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:26,047
that your breath doesn't
smell like alcohol.

66
00:02:26,114 --> 00:02:28,082
You want to go grab
a beer after work?

67
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:30,584
I prefer not to have social
interaction with coworkers.

68
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:33,320
It, um, hasn't worked
out for me in the past.

69
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:36,456
Well, maybe he just
doesn't like fist-bumping.

70
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,291
Hey, Wayne.

71
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:43,428
As God as my witness,
this fist will be bumped!

72
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,730
Put that
fool thing down.

73
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,098
ANNOUNCER:
<i>We now return to</i>

74
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,533
Master Chef:
Extreme Snack Edition.

75
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,472
Marge, your ratio of peanut
butter to cracker was spot on.

76
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:57,807
And I loved the addition
of the thin slice of apple.

77
00:02:57,874 --> 00:02:59,508
This was a great
plate of food.

78
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:00,909
Thank you.

79
00:03:00,977 --> 00:03:03,411
This is my third favorite
reality cooking show.

80
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:06,147
For your prize, you have won
a brand-new kitchen,

81
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:07,615
which I will now become.

82
00:03:07,683 --> 00:03:09,350
(makes transforming noises)

83
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:11,785
Ow! Ow! Ow!

84
00:03:11,852 --> 00:03:13,654
I miss my soul patch.

85
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:15,088
(groans):
Oh.

86
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:20,290
Kids, enjoy your
extreme snack.

87
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,893
Wait, this tastes different.

88
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,861
I put a slice of apple in it.

89
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:27,062
Gross.

90
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,730
You know
I hate surprises.

91
00:03:28,798 --> 00:03:29,798
You tricked us.

92
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:32,668
I like routine.
I like routine.

93
00:03:32,735 --> 00:03:33,702
(sighs)

94
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,070
(sighs)

95
00:03:35,138 --> 00:03:36,805
Did you have
a hard day, too?

96
00:03:36,873 --> 00:03:39,640
Ah, a guy at work
seems not to like me.

97
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:40,940
I guess it's not much

98
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:43,041
when you look at real problems
in the world,

99
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:45,744
like Major League umpires
not using instant replay.

100
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:47,011
It's big to you.

101
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,513
Would you like
a get well pork chop?

102
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:51,081
I love you so much.

103
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:53,049
Potatoes and gravy
on the side, please.

104
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:54,350
(whistle blows)

105
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,654
Charlie, want to
grab a beer?

106
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:02,390
No, I was tipsy last night
when a telephone survey called,

107
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,225
so I told them
to call back tonight

108
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:05,759
for more accurate answers.

109
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:07,127
Oh. Okay.

110
00:04:07,195 --> 00:04:08,528
(thunder rumbling softly)

111
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:13,466
(gasps)
Wayne!

112
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:16,101
Want a ride?

113
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:17,735
I can walk.

114
00:04:17,803 --> 00:04:20,270
(hail pattering)

115
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:23,374
(groans)

116
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:25,277
All right, Homer,
you win.

117
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:28,280
You know, I just got a little
chill when you said my name.

118
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:29,647
(quietly):
Every town I go to,

119
00:04:29,715 --> 00:04:31,382
I run into some guy
just like this.

120
00:04:32,717 --> 00:04:34,451
Look, I'm not
weird or anything,

121
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,021
I just like to feel like
I'm friends with everybody.

122
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:39,256
(sighs)
Homer, you're a nice guy.

123
00:04:39,324 --> 00:04:40,824
I'll have one beer
with you.

124
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:42,191
After that, we will have

125
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:45,061
a courteous professional
relationship, and that's it.

126
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:47,530
No secret Santa,
we're not trading lunches,

127
00:04:47,598 --> 00:04:49,065
Oh!
and I don't want you

128
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:50,900
calling me at home and saying
"Turn on channel six."

129
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:51,968
But what if the weather girl...

130
00:04:52,036 --> 00:04:54,370
I don't care!

131
00:04:57,607 --> 00:04:59,975
Wow, I can't believe
Homer bagged the tiger.

132
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:01,543
Excuse me, I need to use the...

133
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:02,610
Men's room!

134
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:03,745
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

135
00:05:03,813 --> 00:05:06,783
We're completing
each other's...

136
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,451
Completing each other's...

137
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,056
sen... ten... ces...

138
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:21,296
Totally surprising entrance!

139
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:22,463
(cocks gun)

140
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,664
Hand over your
cash and jewelry.

141
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:25,731
Pronto.

142
00:05:25,798 --> 00:05:26,965
(groans)

143
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:31,400
Hmm. Hmm.

144
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:33,502
Okay, now,
don't want no trouble.

145
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,738
Let me just get my cash
out of my cash drawer here.

146
00:05:36,806 --> 00:05:40,541
Just, uh, lining up all
the presidents, nice and neat.

147
00:05:40,609 --> 00:05:42,343
Ain't trying to be no hero.

148
00:05:42,411 --> 00:05:43,444
(chuckles)

149
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,245
Uh...
(chuckles)

150
00:05:45,313 --> 00:05:46,246
Uh, here you go.

151
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:47,814
Thanks for the upgrade.

152
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:48,848
Ha-ha!

153
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:53,751
(grunts)

154
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:54,753
Wayne?

155
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,154
Stand back, Homer!

156
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,855
I know what I'm doing.

157
00:05:57,923 --> 00:05:59,257
Well, we all know
what we're doing.

158
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:00,624
The question is,

159
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:02,326
is it an appropriate
reaction to the situation?

160
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:03,360
(sighs)

161
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:05,796
Drunks are so boring.

162
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:06,796
(gasps, gunshot)

163
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:08,897
(screams)

164
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:10,466
My fresco!

165
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:12,868
That's coming out
of your stealings!

166
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:14,336
(grunts)

167
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:15,938
(yells)

168
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:17,273
(grunts)

169
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,875
Wayne, maybe it's the me
being still alive talking,

170
00:06:20,943 --> 00:06:23,545
but I think you're awesome.

171
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:27,181
I'm just a guy who saw what
needed to be done and did it.

172
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:30,684
Oh, speaking of which, let's
get these eggs back in a jar.

173
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:33,286
(humming)

174
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:37,221
(cocks gun)

175
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,526
Wow, that's the farthest
that one of my eggs

176
00:06:46,594 --> 00:06:48,261
ever made it down
someone's throat.

177
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:54,461
It's great to have
a home-cooked meal.

178
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:57,063
Well, if anyone
saves my Homie's life,

179
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,764
they get a free meal.

180
00:06:58,831 --> 00:07:01,766
Which actually comes up
about once a week.

181
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,901
So, Wayne,
how'd you learn

182
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:05,469
all those cool
self-defense moves?

183
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:06,569
I had training.

184
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:07,904
Special training.

185
00:07:07,972 --> 00:07:10,941
The kind they're not allowed
to give anymore.

186
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:19,284
(grunts)

187
00:07:20,686 --> 00:07:21,653
(screams)

188
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,156
(choking)

189
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:38,500
(grunting)

190
00:07:45,372 --> 00:07:47,773
(quacking laugh)

191
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:49,141
(grunting)

192
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,843
(yelling)

193
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:54,579
(roaring)

194
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:57,949
(straining)

195
00:07:59,517 --> 00:08:00,783
Sorry.

196
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:01,883
I have to go.

197
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:03,750
Oh, come on,
stay for dessert!

198
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:06,720
(straining)

199
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:08,655
(sighs)

200
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,356
(door opens, closes)

201
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,924
Hey, Simpson, you want to hear
about the big change in my life?

202
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,359
Sure, why not.

203
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:17,995
I started drinking
orange juice with pulp.

204
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:20,031
I asked the Reverend,
and he said it was okay.

205
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:21,533
Then he hung
right up on me.

206
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,936
That man is cranky at
3:00 in the morning.

207
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:30,144
And here he is, this
week's Noble Nobody.

208
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:32,010
What the... (bleep)

209
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:34,212
A quiet, unassuming
security guard

210
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,347
who foiled a robbery
at a local tavern,

211
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,383
as seen in this Taiwanese
animated dramatization.

212
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,484
(female narrator
speaking Taiwanese)

213
00:08:54,897 --> 00:08:56,864
(laughing)

214
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,203
(tires screeching)

215
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:05,104
(video game sound effects)

216
00:09:07,674 --> 00:09:09,308
Please, sir,
just let me do my job.

217
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:10,709
Pish tush.

218
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:13,477
Wayne, as a reward for
your valiant fisticuffery,

219
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:14,878
I hereby award you

220
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:17,380
the Springfield Nuclear Plant
Silver Safety Hat.

221
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,684
(fanfare plays)

222
00:09:20,752 --> 00:09:23,153
(fanfare plays, horses neigh)

223
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:24,688
(chuckles maniacally)

224
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,692
Thanks to you, Wayne,

225
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:31,259
we did not lose the
visible half of the moon.

226
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:32,627
Just doing my job, sir.

227
00:09:32,694 --> 00:09:33,728
All too well.

228
00:09:33,795 --> 00:09:35,229
I'm afraid that protocol demands

229
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:36,997
that I totally
erase your memory.

230
00:09:38,432 --> 00:09:39,733
(grunting)

231
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,541
(crackling)

232
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:48,942
(grunting)

233
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,577
Die, you fascist bastard!

234
00:09:51,645 --> 00:09:54,179
Mother, is that you?

235
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:56,047
Wayne, stop!
That's Mr. Burns!

236
00:09:56,115 --> 00:09:58,850
(gasping)

237
00:09:58,918 --> 00:10:00,485
Ooh.

238
00:10:00,552 --> 00:10:03,220
I expect insolence,
but rank insolence?

239
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:04,355
Off with his job!

240
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:05,523
(sighs)

241
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:06,457
Damn it.

242
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:09,292
Why don't you
come stay with us

243
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,027
till you can get
back on your feet?

244
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:12,862
Really? Are you sure?

245
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,963
Of course.

246
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,331
I mean, how long
could it be?

247
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:16,832
I don't know.

248
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,834
I've got no job, no references,
can't afford my apartment.

249
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:22,503
It's best to concentrate
on what you do have.

250
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:25,271
I have reoccurring flashbacks
to a nightmarish past.

251
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:27,006
That's funny, because I have

252
00:10:27,074 --> 00:10:29,742
reoccurring flash-forwards
to a nightmarish future.

253
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:33,845
(chanting):
Unfair! Unfair!

254
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:35,946
That robot took our jobs!

255
00:10:37,415 --> 00:10:38,881
He said it.

256
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:40,316
Or, uh, maybe it was him.

257
00:10:41,451 --> 00:10:44,987
Man, this robot really gets me.

258
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:48,356
My nightmares are real.

259
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:52,059
Your voice is so gravelly,
just like Lauren Bacall's.

260
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,439
If you don't listen to me,
Senator,

261
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,775
there's not going to be
a Fourth of July!

262
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:06,476
WAYNE (panting): Don't you get it?
- He used the governor's eyeball

263
00:11:06,544 --> 00:11:08,210
for the retinal scan!

264
00:11:08,277 --> 00:11:10,345
That's ten members
of the electoral college

265
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:11,880
dead in one day!

266
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:13,681
If you don't give me
those launch codes,

267
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:15,916
you'll never be able to make
the "okay" sign again.

268
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:18,018
I know the map
is inside your eyelids,

269
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:20,854
and I will turn them
inside out if I have to!

270
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:23,589
If you move that little top hat
to St. James Place,

271
00:11:23,657 --> 00:11:25,324
we'll all be blown
to kingdom come!

272
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:27,459
Bring me every fish
in that aquarium!

273
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:29,461
One of them is lying!

274
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:30,696
(relieved sigh)

275
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:32,899
I'm sorry I have
so many nightmares.

276
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:34,367
I've done
unspeakable things,

277
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:36,436
from Buenos Aires
to the Ukraine.

278
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:38,205
Well, what brought you
to Springfield?

279
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:40,841
Was it our Frito-Lay
distribution center?

280
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,543
I needed somewhere to lie low.

281
00:11:42,611 --> 00:11:44,779
Your town appears
on no maps or charts.

282
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:47,048
Yeah, they couldn't find
a Google map photo

283
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:48,716
without me naked
or urinating.

284
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:50,985
And when there was
a mapmaker's convention here,

285
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,688
they all got
Lou Gehrig's disease.

286
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,390
Not the one you're
thinking of--

287
00:11:54,457 --> 00:11:56,125
there's
another one.

288
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:58,461
So, Lisa, if you press
on Bart's elbow,

289
00:11:58,529 --> 00:11:59,762
here,
Ow!

290
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,530
he'll tell you
anything you want to know.

291
00:12:01,598 --> 00:12:02,831
I admit it!
I let Milhouse

292
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:04,266
lie down in your bed!

293
00:12:04,334 --> 00:12:06,602
Kids, can I talk
to Wayne alone a minute?

294
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:09,869
Remember everything they say,
and tell us later in rattle code.

295
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,404
(rattling)
What do you mean, no?

296
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:12,672
(grunts)

297
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,874
I don't know if you
should teach our children

298
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,110
advanced interrogation
techniques.

299
00:12:17,178 --> 00:12:18,077
I'm sorry, Marge.

300
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:19,845
Sometimes I forget where I am.

301
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:21,713
Apology accepted.

302
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:25,050
Now, could you teach me
a couple little driving tricks?

303
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:36,856
(laughs)
We'll see who gets their pick

304
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,557
of pizza pockets!

305
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,593
Give us your lunch money!

306
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:43,894
(grunting in pain)

307
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:44,927
(martial arts yell)

308
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:45,895
(bones crack, grunts)

309
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:47,196
What gives, man?

310
00:12:47,263 --> 00:12:48,762
Where'd you
learn that stuff?

311
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,563
If I told you,
I'd have to kill you.

312
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:51,798
Can I tell you?

313
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:53,633
No! I won't listen!

314
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,335
We can't keep serving
the same thing every day.

315
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:59,038
These kids have mashed potatoes
coming out of their ears.

316
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:00,239
(Jimbo yells)

317
00:13:00,306 --> 00:13:01,540
Point taken.

by Prokofiev)

319
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:06,510

(music continues)

324
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:23,625
I can't live in the
real world anymore.

325
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:25,293
This is the <i>real</i> world?

326
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:27,662
Hallelujah!
I'm still alive!

327
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,064
Ha-ha! And I'll
appreciate every moment!

328
00:13:30,132 --> 00:13:33,268
Except the ones that aren't
as good as they used to be.

329
00:13:33,336 --> 00:13:34,903
Which is all of them.

330
00:13:34,971 --> 00:13:36,738
Oh, someone kill me.
