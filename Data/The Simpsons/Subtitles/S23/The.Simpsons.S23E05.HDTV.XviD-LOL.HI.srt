3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,702
And here's a marble for Lisa
for cleaning her room,

4
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:12,405
and a marble for Bart
for not trashing Lisa's room.

5
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:14,981
The jars are full,
so you've earned

6
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:17,517
your Saturday Surprise Dad Day!

7
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:19,019
BART and LISA:
Yay!

8
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:22,422
This Saturday, from the dad who
brought you cemetery paintball

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,324
and go-karts on real roads,

10
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:26,476
comes the greatest
activity yet...

11
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:30,614
BART and LISA:
Video game convention!

12
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:32,732
(cameras clicking)

13
00:00:34,936 --> 00:00:37,721
(crowd gasps)

14
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:39,005
(crowd cheering)

15
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:40,557
And check these out.

16
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,442
BART and LISA:
VIP passes!

17
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,911
Is there any better feeling
than cutting in line

18
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:47,864
because a plastic badge
says you're special?

19
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:49,482
(drools)

20
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:52,786
(Bart and Lisa drool)

21
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,721
(all gasp)

22
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:55,889
BART:
GTS!

23
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:57,390
HOMER:
So many games.

24
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,225
- Ah.
- Wow.

25
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,827
BART:
Whoa.

26
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,629
(gasps)
W.O.K.?!

27
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:04,998
HOMER:
Ooh, the Flying Tomato.

28
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,033
BART:
Ah! TMTOLO!

29
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:08,635
DL2L-to-D!

30
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:10,437
Oh! ACSOL!

31
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:11,671
HC1?!

32
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:15,392
Whoa! Guts of War Two:
Entrails of Intestinox!

33
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:19,779
Colon slash!

34
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,564
Rectum kill!

35
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:24,167
We've made a game that'll
reward the hardcore gamer

36
00:01:24,235 --> 00:01:26,086
with hundreds and hundreds
of hours of...

37
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:28,004
- Finished it.
- Huh?

38
00:01:28,072 --> 00:01:30,590
(fanfare plays)

39
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:32,776
But working on this game
cost me my marriage.

40
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,945
I-I have twins
I've never met!

41
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:38,181
Well, when you meet them,
tell them your game's too easy.

42
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:44,004
This game has all the best
college marching bands.

43
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,573
From the precision footwork
of Ohio State

44
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:49,876
to the lame, dead-on-arrival
humor of Stanford.

45
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,077
(crowd cheering over TV)

46
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:52,779
("Stars and Stripes Forever"
playing)

47
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:54,547
Uh-oh, I'm losing the crowd!

48
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,249
(grunting)

49
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,218
GAME ANNOUNCER:
Level cleared.

50
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,788
Next level: study for chemistry
test on 12-hour bus ride home.

51
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,123
(giggles)

52
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,659
This is the funnest game ever!

53
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:09,595
Man, how many quarters
does this game take?

54
00:02:09,647 --> 00:02:13,233
Dad! Funtendo is unveiling their
new system in three minutes,

55
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,601
in Hall G!

56
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,436
And we're in Hall D.

57
00:02:16,487 --> 00:02:19,055
Three halls, three minutes.

58
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:21,791
No problem.

59
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,681
HOMER:
Out of my way! Move it!

60
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,215
(people screaming)

61
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:31,601
Geeks must yield to normals!

62
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:32,602
(grunts)

63
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:34,521
(panting heavily)

64
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:39,509
(cash register dings)

65
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:41,428
(chewing, ascending beeps)

66
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,046
Room's full.

67
00:02:43,114 --> 00:02:44,147
Hmm.

68
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:45,899
Aha!

69
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,200
(laughs)

70
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:48,635
BART and LISA:
Yay!

71
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:50,670
(fanfare plays)

72
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:51,671
Woo-hoo!

73
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,040
(humming)

74
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,141
(tires screech)

75
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,342
Conventions rock!

76
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,644
Fun Dad rocks!

77
00:02:57,712 --> 00:02:59,312
I need a nap!

78
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,580
(Bart and Lisa laugh)

79
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:02,949
You kids have had a big day.

80
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,185
Head up to the tub
while I deflate your toys.

81
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,587
Save us, Fun Dad!

82
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:08,921
(laughter)

83
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:11,975
(Rod and Todd grunt happily)

84
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:17,297
The kids sure had
a good time with you.

85
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,233
Yeah, I was on today.

86
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:22,569
Scary on.

87
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,871
How come they never call me
Fun Mom?

88
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,557
Look, honey, a
family's like a team.

89
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:31,194
And on every team, you have
the slam-dunking megastar

90
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:33,012
and the referee.

91
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,647
It's not fair.

92
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,868
Moms want to be fun, but we're
stuck with all the mom stuff.

93
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:41,221
Okay, okay, how about this:

94
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:45,675
next week, you take the kids
on a Saturday Surprise Dad Day.

95
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:47,377
What if...

96
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:50,897
we roll pennies
and go to the dollar store?

97
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:52,549
That's good, Marge!

98
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:55,151
Get all the terrible
ideas out of your system.

99
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,302
(groans):
Oh.

100
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,922
I've got it!

101
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:03,359
Your Saturday Surprise Mom Day
is the X-Games!

102
00:04:03,427 --> 00:04:05,395
BART and LISA:
Yay! X-Games! X-Games!

103
00:04:05,463 --> 00:04:07,380
All right!

104
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:10,116
That isn't an "X," Mom.

105
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:12,418
Welcome to the Cross Games,
Simpsons.

106
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,387
A Christian fellowship expo!

107
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,156
Are there at least games here?

108
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,624
Oh, no, "games"
stands for

109
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,944
Gathering of American Messengers
for Evangelical Sports.

110
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,095
Sports?

111
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:23,596
(chuckles)
"Sports" stands for

112
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:26,065
Strict Parental Oversight
Rather Than Sports.

113
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,368
(both groan)

114
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:32,222
Come on, kids,
fun comes from inside.

115
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,040
It isn't about
what we actually do.

116
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,308
Yes, it is!

117
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:36,843
That's all it is!

118
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:38,027
You're right, you're right,
you're right.

119
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,012
Let's go.

120
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,446
Thank the Lord!

121
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,248
Two children
to play debtors

122
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:45,485
in the Parable
of the Unjust Steward.

123
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:49,405
All the other kids are at
something called the X-Games.

124
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,824
(Bart and Lisa groan)

125
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,911
I'm sorry, gang.

126
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,246
I blew it.

127
00:04:56,313 --> 00:04:58,531
(groans) I hate it when
grown-ups call kids "gang."

128
00:04:58,582 --> 00:05:00,466
Don't worry about it, Mom.

129
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:03,002
Dad will take us on
a great outing next weekend.

130
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,871
(sighs)

131
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,039
(engine clanks, rattles)

132
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:11,144
Why do old squirrels always
crawl into <i>my</i> engine to die?

133
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:12,762
(groans):
Oh.

134
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,882
Guess we'll be making an
unscheduled pit stop, gang.

135
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:17,750
We're not a gang!
Gangs are cool!

136
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,285
(tires screech)

137
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:22,622
Uh, Mom, where are we?

138
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,740
Nowhere scary.

139
00:05:25,943 --> 00:05:27,744
(engine hissing)

140
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:29,412
Everything's fine.

141
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,448
We'll just wait here
for the tow truck.

142
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:35,785
That newborn
has earrings!

143
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,951
Mom, we're hungry.

144
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:44,452
(groans):
Oh.

145
00:05:44,537 --> 00:05:46,137
I guess we could
make a sprint

146
00:05:46,205 --> 00:05:48,373
for one of these
local establishments.

147
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:53,478
(Marge groaning)

148
00:05:56,348 --> 00:05:58,650
They're using pancakes
as spoons.

149
00:05:58,717 --> 00:06:01,019
Ooh, let's see
what else they do wrong.

150
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:07,542
(groaning)

151
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,893
Ew!

152
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:09,861
Ugh!

153
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:11,446
They're selling CDs

154
00:06:11,513 --> 00:06:13,531
<i>in</i> the restaurant!

155
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:14,782
Back to the car!

156
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,551
What can I get you?

157
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:18,987
Oh, I'll just have
a side salad.

158
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:20,989
We have no side salad.

159
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:22,156
Back to the car!

160
00:06:22,224 --> 00:06:23,157
Relax, Mom.

161
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:24,292
Be adventurous.

162
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,643
Yeah, just have fun.

163
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:27,228
Dad would.

164
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:30,031
(sighs)

165
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:31,950
What's the craziest thing
on the menu?

166
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:34,185
(chuckles) She means
the most authentic.

167
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:36,487
Well, that would be

168
00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:38,222
the Zelzel Minchet
Aletcha Wat.

169
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,792
Then I'll have that!

170
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,693
(all gasp)

171
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,263
Okay, Marge,

172
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:47,849
you test-drove a convertible
once; you can do this.

173
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,807
(lively Ethiopian music playing)

174
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,609
(taste buds gasping,
murmuring excitedly)

175
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:03,481
Holy casserole-y!

176
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:04,882
That's good gloop!

177
00:07:07,086 --> 00:07:08,920
I wish I lived in Ethiopia!

178
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:13,057
Exotic, getarian,

179
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,193
I can mention it
in a college essay.

180
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,595
Mom, this
is amazing!

181
00:07:17,663 --> 00:07:19,147
(all chewing noisily)

182
00:07:19,214 --> 00:07:21,449
Wait, wait, wait,
what is she eating?

183
00:07:21,517 --> 00:07:23,084
They've never
served me that dish,

184
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,253
and I wear indigenous
beaded headgear.

185
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:26,587
Oh, this?

186
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,890
It's just a little
Zelzel Minchet Aletcha Wat.

187
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,325
It's all I ever eat here.

188
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:32,226
(gasps)

189
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:36,130
They have prepared her a dish
from the non-translated page!

190
00:07:36,198 --> 00:07:37,632
(gasps)

191
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,801
So grab a pancake
and slurp some slop!

192
00:07:39,868 --> 00:07:42,170
Foodies,
heed my call!

193
00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:45,657
Commence ripping and dipping!

194
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:48,326
(all chewing noisily)

195
00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:50,762
So, did all of your cars
break down?

196
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:52,563
Mom, they're
here on purpose.

197
00:07:52,631 --> 00:07:54,032
They're foodies.

198
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,366
Indeed.

199
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,769
Our passion is to seek out
interesting foods,

200
00:07:57,836 --> 00:08:00,238
savor their exotic flavors,
then blog about them.

201
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:02,006
Yes.

202
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:04,308
We discovered Korean barbeque
in this town.

203
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:06,778
Uh, before the Koreans?

204
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:09,280
Oh, sure they cook it,
but they don't get it.

205
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:13,484
"When you stick a pancake into a
friend's mouth, it's a goorsha."

206
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:15,586
Everybody goorsha!

207
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:17,388
ALL:
Goorsha!

208
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,706
BART and LISA:
Goorsha! Goorsha! Goorsha! Goorsha!

209
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,124
Goorsha! Goorsha!
Goorsha! Goorsha!

210
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:21,259
Goorsha!

211
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:23,161
Marge, the kids
are acting ethnic!

212
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:25,029
Relax, Homie.

213
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:27,832
Have some leftover
Galalalalalalalalah.

214
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,802
(grunting)

215
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:32,186
Oh, no.

216
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:35,723
I don't eat anything new
unless I've eaten it before.

217
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,658
Aw, come on, Dad,
be a foodie.

218
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,343
You're already
a fatty and a drunkie.

219
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:42,313
I don't want to think about
food, I want to like it.

220
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:47,018
Why drive across town
to savor a bowl of mystery mush

221
00:08:47,086 --> 00:08:49,220
when there's four different
Krusty Burgers

222
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:51,489
we can see from our house?

223
00:08:51,557 --> 00:08:55,259
Oh, and here's my favorite
restaurant: La Fridge.

224
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,730
It's open 24 hours a day
and there's no dress code.

225
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:04,385
What kind of American man

226
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:06,704
doesn't want to explore
global food culture?

227
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,656
And then brag about
it on the Internet.

228
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:11,125
We should start
our own food blog.

229
00:09:11,193 --> 00:09:12,093
(gasps)

230
00:09:12,161 --> 00:09:14,962
The Three Mouthketeers.

231
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,297
Three?

232
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:19,217
You mean, one, two... me?

233
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:22,186

00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,897
of Springfield's top 99
Afghan restaurants.

265
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:42,834
I feel bad for all those places
that didn't make the cut.

266
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:45,937
All right, food
nerds, reality check.

267
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:48,940
All the food in those
pictures is poop by now.

268
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:52,076
Minds blown,
you're welcome.

269
00:10:52,144 --> 00:10:53,644
(groans):
Oh.

270
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:56,180
I'll remind you kids
what real fun is.

271
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:57,682
Hey, hey, kids!

272
00:10:57,749 --> 00:10:59,016
(laughs)

273
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:00,651
Krustyland has a new ride.

274
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,353
The Eyeballs of Death.

275
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:05,323
It only passed the safety panel
by a three-to-two vote.

276
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,325
And that third vote
didn't come cheap.

277
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:08,993
(laughs)

278
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,461
And I've got tickets

279
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:12,430
for the grand opening
Saturday night.

280
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:14,599
Whoa!
(gasps) Cool.

281
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,551
Uh, kids,
don't forget

282
00:11:16,618 --> 00:11:18,886
about our special plans
Saturday night.

283
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:20,788
Oh, sorry, Dad.

284
00:11:20,856 --> 00:11:22,990
Our blog is so popular,
we got an invitation

285
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,560
to the most exclusive
restaurant in town.

286
00:11:25,627 --> 00:11:28,095
Kent Brockman himself
could only get

287
00:11:28,163 --> 00:11:30,998
a reservation at 5:30 or 9:30.

288
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,049
(giggles)

289
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:33,601
It's called
El Chemistri,

290
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:35,870
and they use science
to make the food.

291
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:41,058
Behold... pine needle sorbet.

292
00:11:41,126 --> 00:11:43,895
(moaning)

293
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:46,297
Pine needle... sorbet?

294
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:48,966
Pine needle sorbet?

295
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:52,603
My kids do not eat sorbet;
they eat sherbet.

296
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,238
And they pronounce
it "sherbert,"

297
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:55,973
and they wish it
was ice cream.

298
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,409
Sorry, Dad, this
is our thing now.

299
00:11:58,477 --> 00:12:00,378
Fine, blow off Fun Dad

300
00:12:00,445 --> 00:12:03,814
and go eat your walrus mustaches
and deep-fried pixie wangs.

301
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,453
Don't be so jealous, Homie,
just because the kids

302
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,039
are finally having fun
doing something with me.

303
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,442
Aah! Jealous? Me?

304
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:16,077
(chortles)

305
00:12:16,144 --> 00:12:18,112
That is to laugh.

306
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,014
The very idea.

307
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:24,385
If anything... (laughs)

308
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,687
you're the one who's jealous.
Of what?

309
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:29,590
Of how much fun
I am to be around!

310
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:32,310
(sobs)

311
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:36,213
It's always a party
with Fun Dad!

312
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:38,349
(sobbing)

313
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:44,188
Too sad to walk.

314
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:48,059
Too sad and fun to walk.

315
00:12:54,684 --> 00:12:55,832
What are you doing?

316
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,835
When I'm sad, I make
baseball bats.

317
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:02,862
Homie, I don't want you
to feel excluded.

318
00:13:02,863 --> 00:13:04,548
Would you like
to come with us

319
00:13:04,632 --> 00:13:06,049
to dinner
at El Chemistri?

320
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:07,751
Really?

321
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:09,887
You'd let me in
on your thing?

322
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:12,322
Even though I think
it's stupid?

323
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,007
Of course.

324
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:15,242
Hand me that
saw, Marge.

325
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,543
Why?

326
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:18,478
When I'm happy,
I make birdhouses.

327
00:13:18,546 --> 00:13:20,047
Kids, guess what.

328
00:13:20,114 --> 00:13:21,915
Mom invited me
to your fancy dinner.

329
00:13:21,983 --> 00:13:23,283
Cool.
Awesome!

330
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:25,869
I guess Fun Dad
is a foodie now.

331
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:28,388
BART and LISA:
Food Dad! Food Dad! Food Dad!

332
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:29,957
(groans)

333
00:13:31,392 --> 00:13:33,226
(murmuring)

334
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,713
I'm food bad boy Tony Bourdain.

335
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:39,283
There's nowhere I won't go
and nothing I won't eat,

336
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,084
as long as I'm paid in emeralds

337
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:43,720
and my hotel room has a bidet
that shoots warm champagne.

338
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:45,622
I'm here at a Singapore
street-food market

339
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,692
with famous blogging family,
the Three Mouthketeers.

340
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,062
Marge, you've got to try
some of this hang hir kuay chap.

341
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,198
Ooh, triple spicy
barbecued stingray

342
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:57,367
stuffed with
pig organs.

343
00:13:57,435 --> 00:13:59,469
Fun Dad
is a foodie now!

344
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:01,388
(munching loudly)

345
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:02,656
(swallows)

346
00:14:02,724 --> 00:14:05,509
This is my thing
and always will be.

347
00:14:05,577 --> 00:14:08,595
(munching loudly)

348
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:11,698
Food Dad! Food Dad!
Food Dad!

349
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,571
Everything's more fun
with Homer.

350
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,873
(speaking faux Swedish)

351
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:31,001
But this was all I had.

352
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:33,470
BRITISH MAN:
Stop your bloody whinging, Marge.

353
00:14:33,554 --> 00:14:35,389
Aah! Gordon Ramsay!

354
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:37,524
You (bleep) it up,
big blue, didn't you?

355
00:14:37,592 --> 00:14:38,892
Why did you
invite Homer?

356
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,727
He stole your
bloody thunder.

357
00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:42,629
You're not as
(bleep) fun as him,

358
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,130
and you never will be.

359
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:45,649
(crying)

360
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:47,167
Darling, darling,
crying's not fun.

361
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:48,702
Homer's fun.

362
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,936
Now, get out
of my dream.

363
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:51,188
It's my dream.

364
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:52,489
Not anymore it's not.

365
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:53,690
Ramsay, awake.

366
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:56,443
What in the hell was that?

367
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,346
(gasps, sighs)

368
00:14:59,414 --> 00:15:02,799
Fun me. Fun me. Fun me.

369
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:05,569
Kids, I was thinking, was
it really such a great idea

370
00:15:05,637 --> 00:15:07,371
to invite your father
to that dinner?

371
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:09,806
Relax-- Dad will be
the life of the party.

372
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:11,975
He'll be the fourth
Mouthketeer.

373
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:14,645
But there weren't
four Musketeers.

374
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:18,515
Yeah-huh. Athos, Porthos,
Aramis and D'Artagnan.

375
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,151
D'Artagnan wasn't
a Musketeer.

376
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:23,253
He only had a letter
of introduction

377
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:26,757
to the captain of the guards--
which he lost!

378
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,059
You know, I'm pretty excited

379
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:30,160
about this far-out dinner.

380
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:31,261
Maybe I'll like it.

381
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:32,596
Oh, I doubt it.

382
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:35,365
You sit at communal tables
full of hipsters.

383
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:37,034
Well, actually,
I've come around on hipsters.

384
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:39,569
Takes a lot of guts
to all wear the same hat.

385
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:41,972
And the food will all
be weird foams--

386
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,408
cooked with chemicals
or served in a test tube.

387
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:46,109
It's too crazy for you.

388
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:47,277
So it's weird.

389
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:48,912
Don't worry, I'll make it fun.

390
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,048
Yeah, you always do.

391
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:53,316
Well, here's where to meet us.

392
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:56,153
1501 W...

393
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,689
East Oak Street.

394
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:00,657
East Oak Street.
Is that it?

395
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:02,225
Uh... yes.

396
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:03,860
Yes, East Oak Street.

397
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:05,328
That's where you should go.

398
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:06,797
See you there.

399
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:09,566
Don't you judge me.

400
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:12,202
Ah, save it for
the sitter.

401
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:15,906
Welcome
to El Chemistri.

402
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:18,108
Please place these mints
in your mouth,

403
00:16:18,176 --> 00:16:20,877
and when your table is ready,
they will vibrate.

404
00:16:22,346 --> 00:16:23,947
Ooh.

405
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:28,969
(dog howling)

406
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:31,421
Here it is: 1501 East Oak.

407
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:33,957
No name on the door--
very trendy.

408
00:16:35,593 --> 00:16:36,993
What do you want?

409
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:38,628
Is this the chemical
kitchen place

410
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:39,896
where you do the
crazy cooking?

411
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:41,364
Quiet, man.

412
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:43,533
The experience begins.

413
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:46,536
Where's Dad?

414
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:48,472
Uh...
I don't know.

415
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:50,373
Probably
changed his mind

416
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:52,275
and stopped off
for doughnuts.

417
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:53,877
(chuckles)

418
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,696
CHEF:
Before you

419
00:16:56,764 --> 00:16:58,899
is a deconstructed
Caesar salad:

420
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:01,735
romaine lettuce gel,
egg yolk ice,

421
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:04,371
crouton foam
and anchovy air.

422
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,806
You eat it like this:

423
00:17:05,873 --> 00:17:08,625
gel, ice, foam, air,
foam, ice, gel, foam, air.

424
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:14,815
Just like Marge said--
chemicals and test tubes.

425
00:17:14,882 --> 00:17:16,683
The open kitchen
is a nice touch.

426
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:19,118
I guess I'll get started
before my family gets here.

427
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,520
How much for a taste?

428
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:21,922
You know,
just to get me going.

429
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:23,023
50 bucks.

430
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:26,092
Ouch. This place is fancy.

431
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,961
The next course is Regret.

432
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:34,968
(delighted moans)

433
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:37,921
(moaning)

434
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:39,306
(chuckling)

435
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:40,574
Hipsters.

436
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:42,409
Too cool for school.

437
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:44,644
You don't look like the
kind of guy who does this.

438
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:46,863
Well, my wife thinks
it's too crazy for me,

439
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:48,999
but I'm going
to prove her wrong.

440
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:50,267
(chuckles)

441
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:51,985
I'm doing this
for my family.

442
00:18:00,357 --> 00:18:03,042
All right, Breaking Baddies,
drop the meth.

443
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:06,529
Pick up the meth!
Pick up the meth!

444
00:18:06,597 --> 00:18:07,831
(gasping)

445
00:18:07,898 --> 00:18:09,699
This better be dinner theater!

446
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:12,435
And now,
pork chops 100 ways.

447
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:13,736
DINERS:
Ooh.

448
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:18,508
100 pork chops!

449
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:20,944
I can't believe Dad
is missing this.

450
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:24,097
Sure, your dad's great,
but I'm fun, too.

451
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:25,598
Look at me eat, huh?

452
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,866
(munching loudly)

453
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:28,234
D'oh. D'oh. D'oh.

454
00:18:30,037 --> 00:18:31,271
Who am I kidding?

455
00:18:31,338 --> 00:18:32,872
I'm not enjoying this.

456
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,141
Even the foam
tastes like nothing.

457
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:36,860
(sighs)
I'm calling Homer.

458
00:18:38,262 --> 00:18:39,295
HOMER:
Marge!

459
00:18:39,363 --> 00:18:40,797
This isn't a food restaurant!

460
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:43,166
It's a meth restaurant!
(gunshots)

461
00:18:43,234 --> 00:18:45,335
A meth-taurant! Aah!

462
00:18:45,402 --> 00:18:47,871
(gasps)
Foodies, help me!

463
00:18:47,938 --> 00:18:49,305
My husband's in danger!

464
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:50,773
Oh, we can't leave now.

465
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:52,575
We haven't had
the root vegetables

466
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:54,944
cooked in the perfect vacuum
of outer space.

467
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:57,447
They say you can't even
understand parsnips

468
00:18:57,515 --> 00:18:59,682
until you had
zero-g parsnips.

469
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,450
(groans)

470
00:19:01,502 --> 00:19:03,670
How dare you
walk out on me!

471
00:19:03,754 --> 00:19:06,055
Your dessert is in
this doggie bag

472
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:09,242
woven from the silk of
a blueberry-fed spider.

473
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,377
Take it and go!

474
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:12,478
(sirens whooping)

475
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:14,848
Ah, shucks.

476
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:16,950
We get the family
dressed up to go

477
00:19:17,017 --> 00:19:19,419
to our favorite meth lab,
and it's all raided out.

478
00:19:19,486 --> 00:19:21,187
(children groaning)

479
00:19:21,255 --> 00:19:22,989
Oh, honey,
I always liked

480
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:25,325
your home-cooked
better anyways.

481
00:19:25,392 --> 00:19:26,759
Aw.

482
00:19:26,827 --> 00:19:29,028
Uh, where do you
think you're going?

483
00:19:29,096 --> 00:19:31,831
A wife needs to tell her
husband she was wrong.

484
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:34,133
And in you go.

485
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:35,935
(whimpering)

486
00:19:36,003 --> 00:19:37,537
Sorry.

487
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:40,290
Everything you've done
here has created problems.

488
00:19:42,209 --> 00:19:44,727
(grunting)

489
00:19:44,795 --> 00:19:46,162
(gasps)
I've got to save him.

490
00:19:46,213 --> 00:19:47,797
(gasps) Ooh.

491
00:19:47,848 --> 00:19:48,848
My dessert.

492
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:52,602
Eat deconstructed apple pie!

493
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:54,270
(grunts)

494
00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:55,889
(swallows)

495
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:57,523
(sighs)

496
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:05,882
<i>Merci, Maman,</i>
<i>pour la tarte tatin à la mode.</i>

497
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:11,738
(sighs)

498
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:17,944
Oh, Marge,
you saved me

499
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:20,113
from the danger
you put me in.

500
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,649
I am so happy
and angry.

501
00:20:22,716 --> 00:20:24,517
I'm sorry.

502
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:26,019
I guess I just
wanted the kids

503
00:20:26,086 --> 00:20:27,987
to look at me the way
they look at you.

504
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:29,188
Aw.

505
00:20:29,256 --> 00:20:31,457
Wow, Mom!
That was awesome.

506
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:33,493
We ate
mad-scientist food

507
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,929
and broke up a meth lab
in the same day.

508
00:20:35,996 --> 00:20:37,897
Fun Mom! Fun Mom!

509
00:20:37,965 --> 00:20:39,799
Fun Mom!

510
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,338
Now, that's my kind
of foam.

511
00:20:45,406 --> 00:20:47,407
This is nice.

512
00:20:47,474 --> 00:20:49,442
A family fun day.

513
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,677
Here's 50 bucks.

514
00:20:50,744 --> 00:20:52,078
For the next
two hours,

515
00:20:52,146 --> 00:20:53,696
I don't want
to know you exist.

516
00:20:53,764 --> 00:20:54,998
(laughing)

517
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:57,700
Family fun day.
