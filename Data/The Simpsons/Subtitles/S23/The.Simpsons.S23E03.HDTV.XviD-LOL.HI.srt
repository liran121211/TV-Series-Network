Massive haul
this year.

To candy!

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,608
Fee-fi-fo-fum, give me
all your candy and gum!

7
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:24,610
Who are you
and why do you want our candy?

8
00:00:24,678 --> 00:00:26,512
Your mother is
the switch witch--

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,381
a sort of tooth
fairy dealie.

10
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:31,683
I take your sugary sweets
and I give you healthy items.

11
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:35,586
Plain brown toothbrushes,
unflavored dental floss

12
00:00:35,654 --> 00:00:39,556
and fun-sized mouthwashes--
TSA approved.

13
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:41,757

16
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:48,633
Now remember, Homie,
that candy goes to...

17
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:51,036
Our fighting
men and women overseas.

18
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:54,306
It's our way of letting them
know we're having fun back here.

19
00:00:54,374 --> 00:00:57,579
No sneaking off and eating
that candy yourself.

20
00:00:57,647 --> 00:00:59,715
Marge, you know
I'd never do that.

21
00:00:59,783 --> 00:01:02,586
I'm too scared
of the evil switch witch.

22
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:04,722
The switch witch is me.

23
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,993
You know, on some level,
I've always known.

Just because you've
had a little setback

100

They say no two ass-webs
are the same.

183
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:07,347
Beautiful in its way.

184
00:07:09,116 --> 00:07:12,351
Want to go home
and celebrate?

185
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,320
(farts)

186
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:16,355
Whoo!

187
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,029
I wish I could
move like him.

188
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:33,478
FLANDERS:
<i>Springfield,</i> <i>my hometown.</i>

189
00:07:33,546 --> 00:07:34,746
<i>Pretty little place.</i>

190
00:07:34,814 --> 00:07:37,015
<i>Although, even</i>
<i>the Garden of Eden</i>

191
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,951
<i>could use a nice cleansing rain</i>
<i>now and then.</i>

192
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:40,952
(laughter)

193
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,187
My money's on the kid.

194
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:44,089
(machine churning)

195
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:46,825
(tires screech)

196
00:07:46,893 --> 00:07:48,327
Hey, whiskers.

197
00:07:48,395 --> 00:07:49,729
Want to party?

198
00:07:49,796 --> 00:07:52,364
Spend less time on your back
and more time on your knees.

199
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:53,532
Hmm?

200
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,069
Have I lost
my back-alley beauty?

201
00:07:57,137 --> 00:08:00,606
Well, those who can't do, teach.

202
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:06,412
FLANDERS:
<i>No more distractions.</i>

203
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,813
<i>I have work to do.</i>

204
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:10,617

(groans)

207
00:08:52,592 --> 00:08:55,093
<i>All these years,</i>
<i>I thought murder was a sin.</i>

208
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:57,429
<i>Then I got new instructions</i>

209
00:08:57,497 --> 00:08:59,699
<i>in his favorite language--</i>
<i>English.</i>

VOICE OF GOD:
Slay Montgomery Burns

211
00:09:01,211 --> 00:09:03,266
and pee in his ashes!

212
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,904
Are you sure, Lord?

213
00:09:04,972 --> 00:09:07,573
If you're having trouble
with the second part,

214
00:09:07,641 --> 00:09:09,341
drink a lot of water.

215
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:11,377
Now I've got to go.

216
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:14,880
A hip-hop star
is thanking me at the VMAs.

217
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:17,916

<i>of the Lord.</i>

220
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:42,841
Peter, Andrew, James

John, Philip, Thaddeus.

222
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,113
Heavenly Father, I...

223
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,548
VOICE OF GOD:
Quiet, you!

224
00:09:49,615 --> 00:09:52,284
Your next divine
whack job is a twofer.

225
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:56,154
I command you to kill
Patty and Selma Bouvier.

226
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:57,589
Patty and Selma?

227
00:09:57,657 --> 00:10:00,325
Sure they smoke, and they don't
shave much of anything,

228
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:02,160
but do they deserve to die?

229
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:05,796
Do not question me,
the star of the Bible.

230
00:10:05,864 --> 00:10:08,900
Now, on a non-murder-
related note,

231
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:11,302
I want you to find out

232
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,605
what's making that funny noise
in Homer Simpson's car.

233
00:10:14,673 --> 00:10:16,474
It's, uh, it's, you know,

234
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:18,509
it's like a
chigga-chigga-chigga-chigga.

235
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,912
But you only hear it
when you're driving over 30.

236
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:23,682
And you never hear it
when you take it to the shop.

237
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,585
Then it sounds perfect.

238
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:28,354
Yes, Lord!

239
00:10:28,422 --> 00:10:30,389
Homer, have you noticed
how many of your enemies

240
00:10:30,457 --> 00:10:31,891
have died lately?

241
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:34,026
Mr. Burns, Sideshow Bob...

242
00:10:34,094 --> 00:10:35,595
You forgot Patty and Selma.

243
00:10:35,662 --> 00:10:37,597
Oh, wait.
That hasn't happened yet.

244
00:10:37,665 --> 00:10:39,600
Patty and Selma?

245
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,602
Who's next,
Ned Flanders?

246
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,471
Now, how would that work?

247
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:44,372
Huh?

248
00:10:45,908 --> 00:10:47,175
(tires screech)

249
00:10:51,013 --> 00:10:52,046

250
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:57,318
(laughs)

251
00:10:58,787 --> 00:11:00,721
Okay, stupid Flanders,

252
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:04,425
first I want you to kill
that guy at the ice cream parlor

253
00:11:04,492 --> 00:11:07,595
who gave Homer Simpson a cone
that had a little air in it.

254
00:11:07,662 --> 00:11:09,029
FLANDERS (sighs):
Really?

255
00:11:09,097 --> 00:11:10,931
Come on!
God does crazy things!

256
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:12,499
Check your Old Testament.
Hey, Dad.

257
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:15,435
Hey Bart...
Uh, I mean, Jesus.

258
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:18,038
Hey son, you want Flanders to
kill anybody?

259
00:11:18,105 --> 00:11:19,372
He's totally in my power.

260
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,141
Well, there's a tall boy
in front of me

261
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,342
in class so I can't see
the board.

262
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,377
And I sayeth unto you,

263
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:26,947
slay every tall boy in town!

264
00:11:27,014 --> 00:11:28,148
Yeah!
Yeah!

265
00:11:28,216 --> 00:11:30,083
Homer Simpson!
(shrieks)

266
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,951
You made a killer out of me!

267
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:34,254
Yeah, and what are you gonna do
about it?

268
00:11:34,322 --> 00:11:37,190
I'm going to kill you!
(shrieks)

269
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:40,126
- Because of you, I'm going to Hell!
- Language.

270
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:42,262
Hell!
Damn! Backside!

271
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:43,696
Nothing matters anymore!

272
00:11:43,764 --> 00:11:46,699
I'm goin' down and my
hand-basket seats two!

273
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,967
(scoffs)
Wake up, Flanders!

274
00:11:49,035 --> 00:11:51,937
There is no Hell,
and there is no God.

275
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:54,372
If there were, would
He let me do this?

276
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:59,510
(gasping and wailing)

277
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:01,245
GOD:
Why you little...

278
00:12:01,313 --> 00:12:04,647
(choking)

279
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:05,648
(gasps)

280
00:12:05,716 --> 00:12:07,584
What happened?!

281
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:10,219
Uh... Flanders killed Homer.

282
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:11,220
But, but...

283
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:13,155
But you're God.

284
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:15,324
Couldn't you make everything
the way it was?

285
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:17,392
Well, I could.

286
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,262
But the big man downstairs
wouldn't like it.

287
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,564
(murmurs)

288
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,767
Get me a coffee!

289
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:26,269
Yes, sir.

290
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:32,575
Could this get any worse?

291
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:36,612
Honey, come back to bed.

292
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,346
Oh, for cryin' out loud!

293
00:12:47,895 --> 00:12:49,663
(indistinct voices)

294
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:51,265
People, you are on the most

295
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,901
inhospitable planet
in the galaxy.

296
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:55,603
Extreme temperatures...

297
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:57,672
vicious indigenous life forms...

298
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,175
Are there any questions? Yes?

299
00:13:00,243 --> 00:13:02,811
Are we in Kansas anymore?
No.

300
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,446
Well, are we in Nebraska?

301
00:13:04,514 --> 00:13:06,715
No!
We are not in any state!

302
00:13:06,783 --> 00:13:08,684
Oh, oh, is it Michigan?

303
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:10,819
Nobody talk anymore!

304
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:13,888
You will now direct your
attention to our C.E.O.,

305
00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:15,356
Mr. Krusty the clown.

306
00:13:15,424 --> 00:13:18,693
We are here on this fakakta
planet for one reason:

307
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,460
Hilarium.

308
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:23,496
Spray this in an audience and
they'll laugh at anything.

309
00:13:23,564 --> 00:13:24,864
And I need some now.

310
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:27,100
Gotta play a Nazi party rally.

311
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:29,269
Oh, yeah, they're back.

312
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:33,040
Our spies will go planet-side,
locate said Hilarium

313
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:35,810
and contact us so that we may
begin extraction.

314
00:13:35,877 --> 00:13:39,314
This is a delicate mission that
requires utter loyalty.

315
00:13:39,382 --> 00:13:41,183
I can think of no better
candidate

316
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:44,287
than the resentful guy in the
wheelchair who has just arrived.

317
00:13:47,024 --> 00:13:50,125
Yes, I think this is gonna work
out just fine.

318
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:54,797
All strapped in?

319
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:56,132
Yep.

320
00:13:57,968 --> 00:14:01,536
Now prepare to take an
incredible journey across the room!

321
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:04,071
(whooshing)

322
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:07,007
Yo.

323
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:17,419
Whoa!
Check out this bitchin' bod!

324
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:19,789
Oh, man, if I could just have

325
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:21,992
five minutes alone with my
old bullies...

326
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:23,393
Hey, avaturd.

327
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:24,594
Are you guys gonna beat me up?

328
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:25,796
Naw, we can't.

329
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:28,299
These avatars cost
$80 billion each.

330
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,135
But your human body costs
nothing.

331
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,838
(grunting and groaning)

332
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,773
(skunk chittering)

333
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,845
(chuckling)

334
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:42,515
(pained groaning)

335
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:45,852
(moaning)

336
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,023
Come on, let's bond,
you stupid jerk.

337
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,894
That's a Japanese outlet, Bart.
You need an adapter.

338
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:57,397
(groaning, zapping)

339
00:14:57,465 --> 00:14:59,232
Oh, maybe I'll just take a taxi.

340
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,534
Where you go?
Where you go?

341
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:01,835
No meter, is cheaper, yeah?

342
00:15:01,903 --> 00:15:03,036
No, thanks.

343
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:05,338
Suit yourself, you
one-eyed bastard.

344
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:07,073
(grunts)

345
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:09,309
Aw, the only thing that looks
good on this stupid planet

346
00:15:09,377 --> 00:15:10,243
are the bananas.

347
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:13,580
Hmm?!

348
00:15:13,648 --> 00:15:15,716
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

349
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:19,686
(battle cry)

350
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:28,728
Thanks, dude.

351
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:30,463
I am a female!

352
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:31,998
You don't have to yell!

353
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:35,135
I am not yelling!
This is my seductive voice!

354
00:15:35,203 --> 00:15:38,505
I am called Kamala.

355
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:42,776
Oh! Even when we're monsters,
he gets the girl. (grunts)

356
00:15:42,844 --> 00:15:45,912
Fool! Every part of
this world is alive!

357
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,448
Apologize to sister rock!

358
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,750
Sorry, sister rock.

359
00:15:50,818 --> 00:15:54,053
Now you've murdered our
brothers, the flowers!

360
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,088
Stupid! Stupid!

361
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,356
Now you're having
sex with Uncle Tree!

362
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,958
(groans)

363
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,959
Thank the Almighty
Fungus you are wiser

364
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,861
and cuter than your friend.

365
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,697
Hey, what gives, man?

366
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:09,834
And now let us touch
testicles and mate for life.

367
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:11,502
Don't you mean tentacles?

368
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,103
I know what I said!

369
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:14,972
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

370
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,208
(zapping)

371
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,247
Today you are a man.
Mazel Tov!

372
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,322
So... was it okay?

373
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,124
It was serviceable!

374
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:34,894
Ah, man, back on Earth we
don't have so many moons.

375
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:38,098
What do you mean,
"back on Earth"?

376
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:43,137
Uh... it's a place on the other
side of this planet that's...

377
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:45,740
very rainy so you can only see
one moon.

378
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:47,141
You know, like Portland.

379
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:49,210
I never hear of
this Port-land.

380
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,714
But on Rigel Seven, lack of eye
contact and too many details

381
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:55,882
indicate the
telling of truth.

382
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,552
I love you, sugar-slime.

383
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,754
(smooching)

384
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,522
Man, you are full
of surprises.

385
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,491
(squawking)

386
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:08,861
I can't believe I'm getting
combat pay for this.

387
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,532
Well done, young man!
Our daughter is with child.

388
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,766
Here.

389
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:16,803
Feel the wonder of
one million fetuses!

390
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:19,974
(grunts) You said you
were using birth control!

391
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:23,310
That only keeps me from giving
birth while we are having sex.

392
00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:24,345
(moans)

393
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:27,014
How do those mountains float?

394
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:29,383
They don't.
They are falling.

395
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:33,187
Now that Kamala has
a slug in the oven,

396
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:37,257
we must make sure she gets
her daily dose of Hilarium.

397
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:41,527
Without it, her crankiness will
become unbearable.

398
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:45,264
Unfortunately our environment is
too hostile to grow pickles.

399
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:48,901
And the only flavor ice cream
we have is butter brickle.

400
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:51,871
To repeat: no pickles,
butter brickle.

401
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:54,373
It is the Rigelian way.

402
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:56,443
So, where can I load up on this
Hilarium?

403
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,612
Listen closely.

404
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,083
The Hilarium is found in the
sacred secretions of the queen!

405
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:10,824
(dialing phone)

406
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:12,492
We have located the Hilarium.

407
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,927
Lock in on my signal.

408
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:18,764
Traitor! How dare you betray
the planet I got laid on?!

409
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,668
They're all in one place.
Let's fry these calamari

410
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:27,237
and dip 'em in a sauce made
of their own blood!

411
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:29,740
And wine from
their own grapes.

412
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:30,807
That's not so bad.

413
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,242
It's a little bad.

414
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:41,952
So Kamala, where do we keep all
our tanks and planes and stuff?

415
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,622
We have no tanks.
Our planet will protect us.

416
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,758
Oh, man, you sound like my
art teacher.

417
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,226
Look a little like her, too.

418
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:51,628
(snarling)

419
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:54,731
(bellowing)

420
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:04,406
(shouting)

421
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:05,207
(growling)

422
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:09,611
(squawking)

423
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:13,649
(yelling)

424
00:19:20,156 --> 00:19:22,091
(hooting)

425
00:19:22,158 --> 00:19:24,894
(battle cry)

426
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:27,196
I guess this is a good time

427
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:29,665
to tell you I've been a double
agent all this time.

428
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:31,500
But now I am
totally on your side.

429
00:19:31,568 --> 00:19:35,070
And this is a good time to tell
you I have space warts.

430
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:37,006
And I got them from
Milhouse.

431
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:37,940
(gasps)

432
00:19:42,678 --> 00:19:45,714
Time for a good old-fashioned

433
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:48,717
servo-suit/bulldozer-saurus
fight!

434
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:54,456
(grunting)

435
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:58,193
(growling)

436
00:19:58,261 --> 00:19:59,761
Dammit!

437
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:02,231
Yo, Colonel! Uh, you've got
some schmutz on your cheek.

438
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:04,566
Where?...
Here?

439
00:20:04,634 --> 00:20:06,869
Skinner...!

440
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:11,941
Had they asked
for the Hilarium,

441
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:14,310
we would simply have
given it to them.

442
00:20:14,377 --> 00:20:18,013
In Rigelian there is no word
for "yours" or "mine."

443
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:21,750
That's the reason we didn't enjoy
the movie <i>Yours, Mine and Ours.</i>

444
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:24,285
(somber music plays)

445
00:20:26,488 --> 00:20:28,956
Halloween is over,
which means, America,

446
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:31,125
it's time to start your
Christmas shopping.

447
00:20:31,193 --> 00:20:34,996
Infuse our stagnant economy with
dollars you don't really have.

448
00:20:35,063 --> 00:20:39,099
And whatever you do, avoid the
urge to make homemade gifts.

449
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:44,304
Knitting one sweater for someone
costs 27 Americans their jobs.

450
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:45,938
And don't forget, Christmas

451
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:48,508
is a wonderful time to
take up alcoholism.

452
00:20:48,575 --> 00:20:51,110
Come on, you see your
family all year round.

453
00:20:51,178 --> 00:20:54,080
The holidays are for
your bartender. (laughs)

454
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:56,717
("Carol of the Bells" plays)

455
00:21:01,256 --> 00:21:03,592
(music stops) When are we doing
the <i>Black Swan?</i>

456
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:05,961
(moans)

457
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:07,963

458
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:53,742
(scream)

459
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:55,643
