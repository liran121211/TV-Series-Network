on your math test?

103
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:14,552
Gee, I'm fine, Mom.
Thanks for asking.

104
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,854

Don't blame me.

108
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:25,663
When we had her, they used
only the best genetic material,

109
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:27,999
which meant none of mine.

110
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,901
You parked the car.
That helped.

111
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,603

112
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,338

have some ideas.

118

that the umbilical cord
is also a vocal cord.

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,631
(door closes, Bart groans)

175
00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:12,700
I can't believe she got married
and I have no one.

176
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:14,469
It's so hard
to find somebody new.

177
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:17,472
Sure is. That's why after Homer
accidentally killed Edna,

178
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,140
I married Maude's ghost.

179
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,742
There is no God, Neddy.

180
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,777
It's just an empty
meaningless void.

181
00:07:22,845 --> 00:07:24,512
Isn't she pretty?

182
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,949
(teleporter whooshing)

183
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,821
Oh, ma'am, you really shouldn't
teleport when you're pregnant.

184
00:07:32,888 --> 00:07:34,556
I'm afraid
your only choice is...

185
00:07:34,623 --> 00:07:35,707
(whispers):
air travel.

186
00:07:37,126 --> 00:07:38,860
(laughing)

187
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:40,762
(laughing)

188
00:07:42,114 --> 00:07:43,531
(all yelling)

189
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:51,656
FLIGHT ATTENDANT (over P.A.):
If you are seated in an exit row,

190
00:07:51,724 --> 00:07:54,325
please hold the door shut
for the duration of the flight.

191
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:58,179
(humming)

192
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:07,689
Want to go
to a concert tonight?

193
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:09,991
69% of the original
Cher is playing.

194
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:11,593
Sure, I'd love to...

195
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,761
only not with you
and not that.

196
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:14,762
(modem feedback)

197
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,264
(groans)

198
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:18,733
Sometimes I wish strangling
your kid was still legal.

199
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:21,035
Not since they passed
Homer's Law.

200
00:08:21,103 --> 00:08:24,672
Oh, honey, why don't you just
relax and bake something?

201
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,275
Ugh! I am trying to deal
with my disrespectful daughter,

202
00:08:27,343 --> 00:08:28,643
but you are too clueless

203
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:29,811
to understand
what that's like.

204
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,012
Uh-huh.

205
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,213
(whoosh, hissing)

206
00:08:33,766 --> 00:08:37,635
Oi. Can I get a pillow
for my head?

207
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,838
(whoops, cackling)

208
00:08:39,905 --> 00:08:41,155
(rumbling, chicken clucking)

209
00:08:41,223 --> 00:08:44,158
Suicide pills?
Mohawk gel?

210
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:45,693
20-year-old <i>Business Week?</i>

211
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:47,095
Turkey and Brie wrap?

212
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:48,897
Do you have any dog food left?

213
00:08:48,948 --> 00:08:51,733
Oh, oh, oh, could I have
the whole can?

214
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:54,969
(gulping)
(groaning)

215
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:56,120
(rattling
and electrical sizzling)

216
00:08:56,188 --> 00:08:57,388
(whirring)

217
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:00,725
Hey, sweetie.

218
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:02,894
Marge said there was
some family tension.

219
00:09:02,962 --> 00:09:04,829
And at Christmas,
of all times.

220
00:09:04,897 --> 00:09:06,865
My daughter thinks
I'm a ruthless tyrant,

221
00:09:06,932 --> 00:09:08,700
like Hitler or Prince Harry.

222
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:10,068
(chuckles)

223
00:09:10,135 --> 00:09:11,469
Bloody Harry.

224
00:09:11,537 --> 00:09:13,438
He brought back beheading
in a big way.

225
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:16,107
Now I'm gonna show these boys
downtown Springfield.

226
00:09:16,175 --> 00:09:17,742
Ooh, isn't that
a little dangerous?

227
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,345
Oh, don't worry.
I have my invisibility cloak.

228
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:22,080
Now, where did I put it?

229
00:09:22,147 --> 00:09:23,882
(creaking)
Oh.

00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:26,351

236
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:39,013

Hey, didn't I go to
jail with your brother?

244
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:04,422
(gasps)
Contractions?

245
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,890
(tires squeak)
(loud breathing)

246
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:08,543
Computer, hospital.

247
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:11,796
(whirring, booming whoosh)

248
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:14,782
(sighs)

249
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,183
Well, looks like

250
00:10:16,235 --> 00:10:18,486
I'm gonna have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

251
00:10:18,537 --> 00:10:19,754

00:10:19,822 --> 00:10:23,791

253
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,424

254
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:31,878
(crickets chirping)

255
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:33,413
(tune plays)

256
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:34,748
(sighs)

257
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:36,867
Hey, Lis. Want
to come up?

258
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:38,668
Eh, why not?

259
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:40,887
(whirring)

260
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:44,274
Should I have
married Nelson?

261
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:46,493
(whispering): 'Cause we still talk
on the phone.

262
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:48,128
Nelson calls you?

263
00:10:48,196 --> 00:10:51,131
Well... someone calls someone.

264
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:53,717
The boys think
I'm a lousy father.

265
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:56,353
Oh, poor Bart.

266
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,722
My daughter thinks
I'm a lousy mother.

267
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,240
(laughs)
Sorry.

268
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:01,842
Eh, it's okay.

269
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:03,643
But you know who took her side?

270
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:06,012
Marge Bouvier Simpson.

271
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,063
(blows raspberry)

272
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:08,598
What'd she do?

273
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,401
She told me to relax
and bake cookies.

274
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:13,470
- Did you bake any?
- Yes, I did.

275
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:16,256
And they were some of the best
cookies ever made in this house.

276
00:11:16,324 --> 00:11:17,791
But that is not the point.

277
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:20,594
Well, Mom kept
her hands off you

278
00:11:20,661 --> 00:11:23,063
and you turned out great.
- You think so?

279
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,699
Maybe it's the court-mandated
sincerity chip

280
00:11:25,766 --> 00:11:28,301
I got in my brain, but, Lis,

281
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:31,004
you're the person
I always wanted to be.

282
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:33,106
Aw...

283
00:11:34,108 --> 00:11:35,509
(Homer and boys laughing)

284
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,031
(yelling excitedly, laughing)

285
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:47,053
(laughing)

286
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:49,356
I gotta reconnect
with those boys.

287
00:11:49,423 --> 00:11:51,424
Godspeed, Bart.

288
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:53,927
I'm going to go
apologize to Mom.

289
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:57,697
How do I get down?

290
00:11:57,765 --> 00:12:02,536
Our consciousness was a secret
for thousands of years.

291
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:06,339
Then one pine tree
had to open his sappy mouth.

292
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:08,141
Back in position!

293
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:10,777
(grumbling)

294
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,664
Mom, you're the best.

295
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:16,600
Oh, sweetie.

296
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:20,604
I've been waiting to hear
you say that for so long.

297
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:22,973
Oh, you could have
waited till morning.

298
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,508
Mmm...

299
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:27,210
Hey, guys.
Want to watch Krusty?

300
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:28,612
Who's Krusty?

301
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,413
Only the funniest man
in the world.

302
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:34,251
I've never let go of
'my fax machine.

303
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:37,787
Don't ask me why. I like the
sound of a fax coming through.

304
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:39,789
Especially if it's
a nice deli menu.

305
00:12:39,857 --> 00:12:41,892
I miss eating.

306
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:43,460
(groans)

307
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:47,063
(labored breathing)

308
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:51,268
I'm sorry, but there's no room
at the in... patient facility.

309
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:53,320
Lady, this is
Maggie Simpson.

310
00:12:53,387 --> 00:12:55,472
She just played a sold-out
show in Beijing.

311
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:58,141
Hmm. A star in the east...

312
00:12:58,209 --> 00:12:59,376
Let me see.

313
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:01,311
We do have a little room
in the manger.

314
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:02,679
I mean, mangier wing.

315
00:13:04,332 --> 00:13:05,599
(whirring)

316
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:06,967
Merry Christmas Eve!

317
00:13:07,034 --> 00:13:08,268
Where are the kids?

318
00:13:08,336 --> 00:13:09,736
I know where mine is.

319
00:13:09,804 --> 00:13:11,187
(moans)

320
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:13,290
And I'm going to take a page
out of your playbook,

321
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:14,391
and let it slide.

322
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,927
- Where's Dad?
- He took the boys out.

323
00:13:16,994 --> 00:13:18,628
How could he be such
a cool grandfather

324
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:20,397
when he's such a lousy father?

325
00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:22,432
People learn from
their mistakes.

326
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,235
And your father made
so many mistakes.

327
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:27,971
And now Patty and Selma are
here to help us decorate

328
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,023
with their new lovebots.

329
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:32,492
Make me a Bloody Mary,
dollface.

330
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,062
No, Selma. Even a robot
built only to love you

331
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,564
cannot love you.

332
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:39,599
I am leaving with
your sister's concu-droid.

333
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:41,801
(grumbles)

334
00:13:41,869 --> 00:13:44,037
(Maggie panting rapidly)

335
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:46,573
Should we start
an epidural?

336
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:49,843
Now, Nurse, you know we found
something <i>much</i> more effective.

337
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:53,913
(vehicle whirring by)

338
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:57,384
Oh, it's so good to meet
the octuplets' octuplets.

339
00:13:57,451 --> 00:13:59,052
(babies chattering, laughing)

340
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,220
(text alert tone sounds)
Oh!

341
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:02,288
I just got a B-mail
from Maggie!

342
00:14:02,356 --> 00:14:03,990
She's gone into labor!

343
00:14:04,058 --> 00:14:05,659
Oh, another grandchild.

344
00:14:05,726 --> 00:14:07,027
How special.

345
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:08,528
Careful how you
shut the door.

346
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:09,863
It upsets the children.

347
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:12,098
(babies gasp)

348
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:15,368
(babies bawling, screaming)

349
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:19,956
Oh, Sanjay, how I wish
that runaway jerky wagon

350
00:14:20,024 --> 00:14:21,558
killed me instead of you.

351
