There’s a mannequin there

The shoe size calibrator

Yes, Mr. Freedman.
I’m sorry, Mr. Freedman.

You’re lacing it wrong.

31
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,633
I want it overy-undery,
not undery-overy.

32
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,426

I’m leaving this job to work

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,648

what happens to your rule

38
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,360
about not whaling on customers?

Because of exciting
current events,

54
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,022
the Army needs new members.

55
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,857
New members who want
to earn money for college,

56
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,651
and see a part of the world
that tourists never go to.

57
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,862
Doesn’t the Army have to fight
in wars?

59
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,240

we’re going to control
the world.

112

We’re China, right?

113
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,347
Now listen, Bub.

114
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,765
You go down to those recruiters

115
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,684
and tell them Bart is too young
for the Army.

116
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,021
I don’t want this to be
the only memory I have of him.

139
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,702
well, I don’t know,
joining the Army?

140
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,872
Wouldn’t that take me away from
my family for two whole years?

141
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,334
Hey, a big target like you will
be home a lot sooner than that.

142

143
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,714
Now where’s my parade?

go into space, attend

00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,466
I have to, Marge.

00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,435
Aw, oh, oh, don’t, no.

161
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,020
(baby talking):
Daddy’s just teasing.

162
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,646
Of course you could.

163
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,607
You could keep it
under a hundred.

164
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,192
Yes, you could.

165
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,194

No, she couldn’t.

167
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,664

spend the next two hours

a secret weapon--

358
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,589
one more deadly
than any gun.

359
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,091
-Lisa’s face?
-A phone tree.

360
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,342
Huh?

361
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,677
Well, you’d
better hurry.

362
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,179
I don’t think Dad
can last much longer

363
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,180
where he’s hiding.

364
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,806
(coughing)

365
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,309
Dorothy’s daughter comes
every Sunday

366
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,853
and brings all kinds
of wonderful soups.

367
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:43,854
(annoyed):
Oh...

368
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,315
And Melvin’s son
brings a banjo.

369
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,234
And he works our names
into his songs.

370
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,486
(anguished):
Oh...!

371
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,198
Hello, Helen?

372
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:57,159
I’m calling about the recent
destruction of our town.

373
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,954
Well, I have a little plan
to fix their wagon.

374
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,165
(telephones ringing)

375
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,124
-Hello.
-Hello.

376
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:04,958
Hello.

377
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:09,254
-Hello.
-Hello.

378
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,131
Yes, Nelson,
of course I’ll help.

379
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,758
And a haw-haw to you.

380
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,218
So that’s the plan.

381
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,679
We’re meeting
at the reservoir at 8:00 p.m.

382
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,556
I flushed a potato
down the toilet.

383
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,809
Now we have to
live in a hotel.

384
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:22,810
Terrific.

385
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:23,852
Now call
Lindsay Naegle.

386
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,236
Marge, why did you
have us bring our liquor

387
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,113
to the reservoir?

388
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,199
We’re going to dump it in
the water to get the Army drunk.

389
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,158
Wow, uh...

390
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,245
this’ll be the first time
I ever watered down <i>my </i>booze.

391
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,371
(laughs nervously)

392
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,456
Moe, why are your
eyes darting back
and forth so much?

393
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,749
Oh, I-I’m just thinking

394
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,293
about a-a great tennis
match I saw once, yeah.

395
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,796
Uh, uh, now I’m thinking
about ping-pong.

396
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,549
A... ver-very fast chess game.

397
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,968
A... snappy David Mamet play.

398
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,017
What the hell...
happened to us?

399
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,561
I’ll tell you
what happened to us.

400
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,522
Y-You used to be cool and
then you got promoted.

401
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,607
I’m still cool.

402
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,608
Oh, really?

403
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,318
When’s the last time
we took the tank

404
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,112
and went down to
Hansen’s Point?

405
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,446
Just the two of us?

406
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,241
All right, all right,
here’s the plan.

407
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,577
We’re gonna take
a li-little nap,

408
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,955
and then we’re gonna wake up
fresh as daisies.

409
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,958
(snores)

410
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:34,006
Colonel, we’re here to discuss
the terms of your surrender.

411
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,090
Surrender?

412
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,717
Never.

413
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,137
Hmm, let’s see what
your hangover has to say.

414
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,138
(blows horn)

415
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,973
Great Cheney’s Ghost!

416
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,516
You win.

417
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,893
Colonel, I hope
you’ve learned

418
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,519
that an occupying
foreign force

419
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,272
can never defeat
a determined local populace.

420
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,816
Among the many things
we learned in Vietnam...

421
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,692
Horn, please.

422
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,735
(blows horn)

423
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,574
Simpson, you may have won,
but you still have to serve

424
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,993
the remainder of
your tour of duty.

425
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,204
All right,
but no combat.

426
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,705
Don’t you
worry, ma’am.

427
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,999
A man of your
husband’s ingenuity

428
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,251
can be put to
very good use.

429
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,505
Dudes.

430
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,882
Want to make
some extra spending money?

431
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,342
Get a free pair of boots?

432
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,345
Hey, baby,
you like obstacle courses?

433
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,346
Thinking it over, huh?

434
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,306
I’m cool with that.

435
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,683
Hey, pal, like the way
you handle that mop.

436
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,684
You like killing?

437
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,478
Hey, ladies.

438
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,022
Are you tired of waiting
for sanctions to work?

439
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,233
I know I am.
