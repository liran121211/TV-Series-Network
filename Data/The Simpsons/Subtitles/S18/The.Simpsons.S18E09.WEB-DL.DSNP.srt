Elvis Stojko

He can lace up
my skates any time.

38
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,601
Don’t you hags know
that all male figure skaters

39
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,186
are "twinkly in the lutz"?

40
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,855

those figure skaters,

50
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,213
sure are having
a swell time out there.

51
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,548
Indeed!

52
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,466

-Never!

is gorgeous.

87
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,641
I’ll take one
in "wife" size

88
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,309
and three in
"mistress" size.

00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,440
Now Smithers,
I need your advice

90
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,818
picking out a gift
for a very dear friend of mine.

91
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,070
A single fellow,
a bit quiet,

92
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,406
but one with a warm,
loyal heart.

93
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,241
Well, sir,
a fellow like that

94
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,244
might have had his eye
on this silver frame.

95
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,621
It would go great with his
collection of Art Deco...

96
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,832
Shut up, shut up!
There he is.

97
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,041
Hello, Phillip.

98
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,584
What are you
doing here?

99
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,877

mind, Mr. Nosey.

102
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,259
Are you going
to that string quartet thing?

103
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,095
-’Cause I’m not.
-(both laughing)

104
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,179
(sotto voce)
Are you still here?

105
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,097
Go pay for that.

106
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,269
Well, uh...

107
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:14,272
what can ol’ Santa bring you
for Christmas, son?

108
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,481
I want a dirt bike,

109
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,151
one of those video game
chairs that vibrate...

110
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,862
Dad, he’s not
the real Santa.

111
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,864
We can’t afford
that stuff.

112
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,075
Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up!

113
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,076
(sobbing)

114
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,911
I better go
after him.

115
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,333
What can I do for you,
young lady?

116
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,003
What I want
can’t be bought at any store.

117
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,546
Oh, what is it, sweetie?

118
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,922
Peace on earth?

119
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,299
What? No!

120
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,301
I-I mean,
that’s a given.

121
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,512
But also, the Malibu Stacy
Pony Beach Party Set

122
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,306
with Sparkle Sand.

123
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,266
It’s sold out
everywhere.

124
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,732
You know,

125
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,693
Santa thinks he saw an
extra Beach Party Set

126
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,487
sitting back
in the stockroom there.

127
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,113
(gasping)
Really?

128
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,281
Y-You just wait here.

129
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,241

131
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:17,335
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

132
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,046
You really made my
daughter’s Christmas.

133
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,799
Well, her smile
made mine.

135
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,388
March your fake boot
fronts over here!

136
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,348
Mr. Costington!

137
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,350
Sir, I’m glad I have
this chance to talk to you.

138
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,352
I’ve been on the payroll
here since May,

139
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,562
and I’d really like
to start working
in Ladies Shoes.

140
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,980
Not literally,
of course.

141
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,565
I... I couldn’t walk
very fast,

142
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,942
though I’d learn
if that’s what it takes.

143
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,318
Never mind that now!

144
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,904
Did you sell
the Malibu Stacy set
I put aside?

145
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,740
That was for you?

146
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,034
It was
for my daughter!

147
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,746
You nitwit!

148
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,040
I want my dolly!

149
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,459
(jowly)
You nitwit!

150
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,212
Now get back
that toy.

151
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,674
Gee, I’m sorry, sir.

152
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,676
Taking back that
doll would break

153
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,303
a little girl’s heart
on Christmas Eve.

154
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:13,891
I made a lot
of mistakes in my life,
but I would never do that.

155
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:17,395
Well, then, you’re...
fired!

156
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,312
But I...

157
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,982

Aw.

158
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,571
Oh, you poor man.

161
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,368
Why don’t you have dinner
with us tonight?

162
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,786
Please, Santa?

163
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,664
Well, let me check
the bus schedule here.

164
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,916
If I get it...
make a transfer there.

165
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,959
Well, I could be there

166
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:40,960
by 2:00 a.m.

167
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,378
We’ll give you a ride.

168
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,379
That’s swell.

169
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,631
Could you swing
by my ex-wife’s place?

170
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,301
I want her to see me
riding in a car.

00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,828
You’re getting
a cab, old man.

182
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,830
In fact, I believe
I see it now.

183
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,124
But I haven’t given you
a present.

184
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,668
Your present
is leaving.

185
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,379
Oh, I don’t see
a cab.

186
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,883
Well, since I’m staying,
how about another song?

187
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,011
♪ Jazzin’ around
the Christmas tree ♪

188
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,306
♪ It’s a skit skat holiday. ♪

189
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,599
LISA & BART:
It’s Christmas!

190
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,559
-It’s Christmas!
-It’s Christmas!

191
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,728
I didn’t think it would
ever come, but it did!

192
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,271
(both laughing)

193
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,275
What is all this?

194
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,444
Well, I figured since
you invited me to stay,

195
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,446
I might as well go down
to the bus locker

196
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,864
and get my stuff.

197
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,074
Oh.

198
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:56,077
Marge, we have
a problem here.

199
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,080
You have a bigger
problem out there.

200
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:03,876
Grumply, grumply groo,
your blood will make my stew.

201
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,295
(whispering loudly)
Do you think that’s
the same Grumple

202
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,214
from the ice show?

203
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,590
Because I do.

204
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,050
(grunts)

205
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,223
Hey, who wants some eggs
a la Harold Stassen?

206
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,516
Huh?

207
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,353
They’re always running!

208
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,729
(Gil laughs)

209
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,940
(Lisa laughs)

210
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,484
(whispering)
Do you really understand
what that means?

211
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,069
(chuckles)
Kinda.

212
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,905
Why did you let that loser
into our home?

213
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,491
I’ll tell you why:
Christian Charity.

214
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,909
Christian Charity?

215
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,953
What does a porn star have
to do with this?

216
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,121
He’s gotta go.

217
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,748
I promise you
he’ll leave after today.

218
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:43,916
Really?
Who’s gonna make him?

219
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,001
I will.

220
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,094
He sure has a lot of markers
that don’t work.

221
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,762
Well, I got something.

222
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,389
Gah! A spider bite,

223
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,641
or as I like to call it,
a "Christmas kiss."

224
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,728
Listen, uh, Gil...

225
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,188
I sort of
thought that...

226
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,566
you know, you’d be
on your way by now.

227
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,734
Really?

228
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,653
You’re gonna put me out
on Christmas Day, huh?

229
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,031
(chuckles)

230
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,157
Well, that’s all right.

231
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,950
I can go down
to the men’s shelter.

232
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,036
I just hope that weird priest
with the runny eye

233
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,622
ain’t serving soup,
’cause they...

234
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,790
Wait, you don’t have
a place to live?

235
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,626
(whispering loudly)
Lower the boom.

236
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,752
(sighs)

237
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,754
I guess you don’t
have to leave

238
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,380
till the holiday’s over.

239
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,008
(grunts worriedly)

240
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,302
(whispering loudly)
Has the boom
been lowered?

241
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,346
No!

242
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,681
(whispering loudly)
D’oh...

243
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,226
<i>TV ANNOUNCER:</i>

244
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,021

246
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,567
Hey-ya, Marge,
Happy New Year.

247
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,402
You make
any resolutions?

248
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,404
Yes. One...
involving you.

249
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,822
What a coincidence!

250
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,157
I made one, too.

251
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,201
I’m gonna move
my fanny off this sofa.

252
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,577
(gasps)
Oh.

253
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,996
And move it over to that
recliner by the phone

254
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,998
’cause I’m expecting
a call any minute now

255
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,000
from my old boss
at Jackpot Realty,

256
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,586
asking me to take over
the Scottsdale office.

257
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,796
Really?

258
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,632
Oh, yeah. That desert air’s
gonna give the ol’ one-two

259
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:15,966
to my bronchitis.

260
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,138
(chuckles)
(coughing)

261
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,265
Oh... boy.

262
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,141
(sighs)

263
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,852
I guess you can stay
a little longer.

264
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,521
Ah, thank you, Marge.

265
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,066
You know, those floats
should really slow down

266
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,611
and savor it, ’cause your life
can go to Hell pretty quick.

267
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,529
(grunts)

268
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,620
We’re not keeping
that moocher

269
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,789
in this house
another minute.

270
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:47,623
(coughs)

271
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,666
He’s still in need.

272
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,543
We have to let him stay.

273
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,837
It’s what Dr. King
would want us to do.

274
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,089
Oh, that’s it.
We’re changing doctors.

275
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,508
Please,
just a few more days.

276
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,759
Marge, admit it.

277
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,303
You just can’t say
"no" to anyone.

278
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,305
That’s why you have three kids.

279
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,682
It’s true.

280
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,851
I do have trouble saying "no."

281
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,561
It all started when I was seven.

282
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,524
Marjorie,
we need you to hide our
cigarettes in your dollhouse.

283
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,692
No!

284
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,818
(both growling)

285
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,281
Mom?
Gramma?

286
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,657
Aunt Larina?

287
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,617
Anybody?

288
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,287
Whoa-whoa-whoa-wha--

289
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,747
Ugh.

290
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,959
And that’s why I have trouble
saying "no" to people.

291
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,544
Even Gil.

292
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,088
Marge,
I have no idea

293
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,507
what you were just
thinking about.

294
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,176
Why would you
think I did?

295
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,636
Uh... hmm.

296
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,096
(dog barks)

297
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,932
(grumbling)

298
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,350
What’sa matter,
Homer?

299
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,144
You still miss
the UPN?

300
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,645
Yeah, but there’s
something else.

301
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,064
There’s this loser staying
in our house.

302
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,524
Marge says she’s gonna
kick him out,

303
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,650
but then she never does.

304
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,235
Well, you can’t kick him out,

305
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,488
’cause then Marge will never
learn to assert herself.

306
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,115
Well, I guess I’ll have
to wait for Marge

307
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,617
to show
some backbone and--

308
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,285

LISA:

366
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,573
Now he even mooches
our lunches.

(Bart grunts)

368
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,953
All he left me with are
these used nicotine patches.

369
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,246
Give me your lunch,
dingus.

370

375
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,483
I’m so sick of Gil.

376
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,318
He ruins Thanksgiving,

377
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,321
uses my leg razor
to peel his carrots...

378
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,699
Marge, I hate to
interrupt the ol’
solilo-diddly-iloquy,

379
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,284
but I just want to
thank you for your
early Christmas card.

380
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,327
Christmas card?

381
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,329
I haven’t even taken
the photo yet.

382
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,331
Isn’t this your posse
on this glossy?

383
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,041
(gasps)

384
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,337
That Photoshopping freak!

385
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,965
Oh, I don’t mean to cause
Gil ill will, but still...

386
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,175
Don’t you defend him!

387
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,720
I want that mooch out
of my house right now!

388
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,097
Marge, I’ve never seen
you like this before.

389
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:55,973
That’s right!

390
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:59,184
I just found my gumption,
and I like it!

391
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,980
Marge Simpson is gonna say no!

392
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,565
Gil! Gil?

393
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,399
Gil!

394
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,358
Gil’s gone.

395
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,568
Back to Scottsdale.

396
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,153
-Problem solved.
-End of story.

397
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,696
Can we have pancakes
for dinner?

398
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,114
Gil’s gone?

399
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,325
But I have a "no" inside me
that has to come out.

400
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,161
Hey, Marge,
you want a thousand dollars?

401
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,162
No!

402
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,329
I mean, yes!

403
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,497
Too late.

404
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,957
(groaning)

405
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,335
Don’t worry. I make
six of those a year.

406
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,425
Even though Gil left,

407
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,218
I still have
to kick him out.

408
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,555
I need this, or I’ll never
be able to say "no."

409
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,432
Mom, I understand
your psychological need,

410
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,225
but I’m not sure
what you can do.

411
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,435
I’ll tell you what.

412
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,520
We’re going
to Scottsdale!

413
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,354
Scottsdale?

414
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,148
Will we stay
at a Tripletree Resort?

415
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,150
-Sure.
-Then forget it!

416
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,995
I’ll ask these active
seniors if they know Gil.

417
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,997
I’ll have you
know I’m 32.

418
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,248
Oh!

419
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,293
(gasping)
There he is!

420
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,339
Gunderson?!

421
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,265
Whoa, Gil’s a big shot!

422
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,684
And to think he and I once
shared a shower.

423
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,270
I don’t care
how successful Gil is.

424
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,731
He’s still a mooch,
and I need to tell him off!

425
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,942
(screeching)

426
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,241
117 degrees?

427
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,742
Ooh, that reminds me.

428
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,868
(heavy panting)

429
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:44,456
There’s water
under the seat!

430
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,958
(whimpering)

431
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,460
Now remember, Marge,

432
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,922
we’re not buying anything
for more than 1.2,

433
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,508
but if I scratch my nose,

434
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,094
that means
we can go to 1.5.

435
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,724
People, remember,
you’re selling dreams!

436
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,101
When a family owns a home,

437
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,603
it means they own
a piece of America.

438
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,731
And what matters most
isn’t the commission you make,

439
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,692
it’s the smiles on their faces

440
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:15,070
when they know they own
that land free and clear.

441
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,488
He’s the best
I’ve ever seen.

442
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,283
He’s talking
at a Century 22 level.

443
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,826
(groans)

444
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,703
Gil, remember me?

445
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,080
Marge Simpson?
What are you doing here?

446
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,291
Lookin’ for a home
on a quiet cul-de-sac,

447
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,626
where your neighbor
could be Tanya Tucker?

448
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,087
Listen, bub.

449
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,714
I have something
to say to you,

450
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,507
and it can’t wait.

451
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,967
Oh, well, looks
like we got

452
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,969
a Backout Betty
on our hands.

453
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,972
But watch ol’ Gil take her
from furious to curious.

454
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,141
Now, ma’am, you say
you can’t wait,
and you’re right.

455
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,351
With interest rates climbing
and choice properties

456
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,147
in the Kingsbridge School
District drying up...

457
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,566
The only house I’m
interested in is my own,

458
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:56,111
which you defiled
for 11 hellish months.

459
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,530
But now I’ve
learned to say "no!"

460
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,990
No to your mooching!

461
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,533
No to your manipulation!

462
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:05,662
And a big fat no to the
Kingsbridge School District!

463
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,999
Aw, come on, you can’t
say no to ol’ Gil.

464
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,751
No!

465
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,129
Why, he’s as pathetic
as we are.

466
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,006
(laughing)

467
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,592
Gunderson!

468
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,177
I put you in charge
of this office

469
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,013
because I thought
you could tame this town.

470
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,182
You’re fired!

471
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,815
