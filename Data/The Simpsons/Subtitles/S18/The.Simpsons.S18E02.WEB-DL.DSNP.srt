182
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,428
And they want me
to join their trio!

183
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,346
Whoo-hoo! What's next?

184
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,431
A contract with
Groove-tone Records?

185
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,226
Take the G-train, baby.
Groove-tone!

186
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,063
(grumbling):
Oh, I can't believe it.

187
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,731
Stupid brother...

188
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,276
Lisa, why aren't you
smiling with us?

189
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,904
'Cause <i>I've </i>wanted to jam with
jazz musicians all my life.

190
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,074
How would Bart like it if I
just hopped on his skateboard

191
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,993
and instantly became great?

192
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,205
Ah... whoa...

193
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,833
(yells)

194
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,212
Mild! Mild! Mild!
Mild! Mild!

195
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,174
(grunts)

196
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,509
(groans)

197
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,178
Lisa, you've got
to be more careful.

198
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,431
I need you to teach me
all about the world of juzz.

199
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,517
It's jazz! Jazz!

200
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,602
(sobbing)

201
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,062
You don't even know
the name of the thing

202
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,939
you are stealing from me.

203
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,774
(chuckles):
Bart, you're so steady

204
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,985
on those skins,
we're gonna call you "Tic Tock."

205
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,113
Oh-- <i>I </i>always
wanted a jazz nickname.

206
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,197
Fine.
We'll call you, uh...

207
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,407
Downbeat.

208
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,867
'Cause
you're bringin' us down.

209
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,537
(groans):
That is the most unfair...

210
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,747
Downbeat, Downbeat,
please.

211
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,165
We're shootin' the breeze
with Tic Tock.

212
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,960
Oh, man, I am so juzzed.

213
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,343
Bart, a rising star like
you needs a manager,

214
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,427
and Gil's your guy!

215
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,971
Oh, I'm a jazz daddy
from way back.

216
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,223
With the skit-skat
skittily boom-de-boom,

217
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,516
and the ding-dong daddy...

218
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,810
Is that jazz?
That's jazz, right?

219
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,772
Cha-cha-cha
with the curly fries.

220
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,941
Hey!

221
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,694
Oh, son.

222
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:58,032
I like you more, now that
other people like you.

223
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,493
It's mergatronic, Daddy-Ho.

224
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,161
Bart, does that
even mean anything?

225
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,246
Xavier Cugat!

226
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,583
(plays drum flourishes)

227
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,335
(crowd applauding)

228
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:15,049
Bossie, the music business would
chew you up and spit you out.

229
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,260
You just keep your eyes
on the prize, girl.

230
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,970
(chainsaws whirring)

231
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,347
(suspicious moo)

232
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,765
Mom, I'm gonna lose it.

233
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,518
Bart's on the cover of both
local jazz magazines:

234
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,937
"Blowin'"
and "The Sugar Sheet".

235
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,107
Here's the only thing I've
been on the cover of.

236
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,529
(sobbing)

237
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,615
Mm, look, uh, how 'bout
we go to the pound,

238
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,076
and get a puppy
just for you?

239
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,244
(stops sobbing)

240
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,871
That might work.

241
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,415
(dogs barking)

242
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,458
Oh, they're all so cute.

243
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,876
Yeah, you know
what's even cuter?

244
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,545
Picking one without
talking to me.

245
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,880
Well, I kind of like this guy.

246
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,466
(barks weakly)

247
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,344
(coughing)

248
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,097
Oh, but this one is precious!

249
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,098
(panting)

250
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,558
(hacking)

251
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,435
(yipping playfully)

252
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,228
(hacking)

253
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,438
(yipping)

254
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,315
Okay, this little guy's
coming home with me.

255
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,402
Who's gonna get neutered
tomorrow?

256
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,654
You are! Oh, yes you are.

257
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,825
(eerie tones playing)

258
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,788
Lisa Simpson...
you doomed me.

259
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,582
(gasps):
I did? How?

260
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,500
By choosing the cuter puppy.

261
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,502
You picked looks over
personality,

262
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,087
youth over experience,

263
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,340
no history of rabies over
unknown rabies status.

264
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,342
And now I'm going to die.

265
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,802
I never wanted
that to happen!

266
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,055
(ghostly):
You suuuuuck! You suuuuuck!

267
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,932
(scratching)

268
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,560
Ah, thanks, sweetie.

269
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,479
You suuuuuck!

270
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,355
Well, if you want him,
you can have him.

271
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,651
And if you
get tired of him...

272
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,028
I won't get tired of him.

273
00:12:59,111 --> 00:12:59,904
It's just too bad

274
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,447
you can't take ol'
Smiley here.

275
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,907
(whimpers)

276
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,826
Yeah, he'll be in God's
Dumpster tomorrow.

277
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,245
I'll take him, too.

278
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,456
And I'm gonna put
ol' Henry here to sleep...

279
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,958
because he knows
my darkest secret:

280
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,419
I like putting
animals to sleep.

281
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,545
(sighs)

282
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,255
I'll take him, too.

Okay, guys.

And if you get hungry,

00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,360
there are rats living in

What are
those noises?

302
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,046
They sounded
zoological.

(gasps):
I just said "shut up."

306
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,307
I'll punish myself
by going upstairs.

307
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,895
Bart!
What are you doing here?

308
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,314
Uh... not smoking reefer.

309
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,398

Bart, that was
a nasty bite you got.

318
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,966
You'll recover...
but you'll never drum again.

319
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:26,967
Says you.

320
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,511

321
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,806
I was a great drummer,
and now I'm nothing,

322
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,350
just like Phil Collins.

323
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,893
I feel so terrible.

324
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,895
I just wanted
to save those animals

325
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,730
while Bart
became a drummer,

326
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:43,692
but I <i>never </i>thought the two
stories would intersect.

Uh, yes, I would like a bird

333
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,964
because I'm often
lonely in the lab.

335
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,800
Birds help.

336
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:09,885
See, Lisa.

337
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,719
We're making progress.

339
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,305
Drop the marsupial!

340
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,141
If those animals aren't gone
by midnight tomorrow,

341
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,644
Animal Control is
gonna round 'em all up.

342
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,605
And kill 'em.

343
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,442

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,946
Can I, uh, can I
borrow that ostrich?

346
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,030
Sure.

347
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,369
How cool is this?

348
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,495
(laughs)

349
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,789
I guess that's it.

350
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,916
These animals
are all gonna die.

351
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,210
Not if I can
help it, Lisa.

352
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,420
Do you have an idea?

353
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,423
Uh, no. Sorry if it
sounded like I did.

355
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,804
Hey, guys,
great news.

356
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,181
I can drum again.

357
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,275
Sorry, Tic Tock.

358
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,986
Your tick is on...
but your tock is gone.

359
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,822
Well, I've got
a confession to make.

360
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,825
This right arm...
it's not mine.

361
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:15,909
Whose is it?

362
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,161
I don't know.

363
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,416
Tic Tock, maybe you
could get yourself

364
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,836
some of that sweet, sweet...
what do you call it?

365
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,087
Arthroscopic
micro-surgery

366
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,089
to reattach
the ulnar nerve?

367
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,382
Yeah, that's
the jingle.

368
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,052
The doctor <i>did </i>say
surgery might help,

369
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,929
but it costs $78,000.

370
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:36,972
Well, I bet we
could raise it

371
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,850
with a benefit
concert. Huh? Huh?

372
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:40,684
Outta sight!

373
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,518
In the pocket!

374
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,437
Groovay, groovay!

375
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,521
Now, you boys know

376
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,606
you don't have
the follow-through

377
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,732
to put something
like that together.

378
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,025
Somethin' like what together?

379
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,068
A benefit concert!

380
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,402
Benefit concert!?

381
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,570
Outta sight!

382
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,738
In the pocket!

383
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,115
Groovay, groovay!

384
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:00,913
Oh, this benefit concert
is gonna be Scooby Dooby.

385
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,665
I'm very happy for you, Bart.

386
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,750
(sighs)

387
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,001
Why are you sad?

388
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,211
Thinking about your marriage?

389
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,047
If we can't find
a home for those animals,

390
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,715
they'll be put to sleep.

391
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,842
Your sister's very upset.

392
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,011
Oh... I feel weird.

393
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,055
It's like a potato
chip full of shame,

394
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,681
going down
my throat sideways.

395
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,392
Honey, what you're feeling
is called "empathy."

396
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,603
Oh... now I'm gonna
learn a new word.

397
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,397
"Empathy" means
you're looking at Lisa

398
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,192
and feeling what she feels.

399
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,153
Your sister poured her heart
into rescuing those animals

400
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,907
to forget the pain of
being upstaged in jazz,

401
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,909
and now...

402
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,120
(moaning)

403
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,454
How can I end this torture?!

404
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,165
You could do
something nice for Lisa.

405
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,042
(agonized moan)

406
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,043
You're my mother.

407
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,461
How can you say that?

408
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,505
(moaning)

409
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:56,927
(drums playing)

410
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,013
(playing jazz tune)

411
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,732
(cheering)

412
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,278
Hey, hey! We got more jazz
superstars on the way, folks!

413
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,531
Gooey Martin, Willie Mimms,
Drop Jaws Turner,

414
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:21,201
Sketch Friendly, Tootsie
Childs, Sammy Biltmore,

415
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:25,247
No-Talent Jones,
Anwar Benitez, Bossy Marmalade,

416
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,499
Bad-Check Mazursky,
Ray-Ray Takamura,

417
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,711
Shaky Premise,
Bootsy Croutonne, Richard Sakai,

418
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:35,132
The Pre-Marital Sextet,
C.S.I. Miami, D.W. Jitters

419
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,301
The Chubb Group,
Cantaloupe St. Pierre,

420
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,053
and many, many, more
funny names!

421
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,305
(laughs)

422
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,725
And it's all to fix
this very talented arm.

423
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:45,559
Ow!

424
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,269
Oh, right,
the nerve damage.

425
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,437
Here's
the benefit money,

426
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,814
Now I'm gonna go vomit
to keep my weight down.

427
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,775
That's right.
That's how Krusty does it.

428
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,029
(feeble laugh)

429
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,366
I wanna thank everyone
for this special night.

430
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,785
Jazz folk may have
the smallest apartments,

431
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,163
but they also have
the biggest hearts.

432
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,248
(cheering)

433
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:12,127
But the biggest heart I know
is in my sister Lisa.

434
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,088
(audience gasps)

435
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,131
WOMAN:
What about me...

436
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,258
...Tootsie Childs?

437
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,426
Lis, you poured your heart

438
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:23,430
into rescuing society's most
vulnerable critters-- animals.

439
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,016
So I want all the money
we've raised tonight

440
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,184
to go to building...

441
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,686
The Lisa Simpson Home
for Abandoned Animals!

442
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,854
(gasping)

443
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:40,739
Oh, Bart, thank you
so, so much!

444
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,159
(cheering)

445
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,911
You know
what we should do?

446
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,162
Hold a benefit concert.

447
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,830
Outta sight!

448
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,915
In the pocket!

449
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,251
Groovay, groovay!

450
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,169
Hey, am I still married
to your sister?

451
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,671
Naw, she died.

452
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,799
♪♪

453
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,634
Shh!
