1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:05,255
(thunder rumbling)

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,382
(wind howling)

3
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,268
MAN (gasps):
Whoa!

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,811
(grunting)

5
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,355
(groaning)

6
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,488
(squeaking)

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,953
Hello, boils and ghouls.

8
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,039
I am the <i>Crypt Keeper,</i>

9
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:42,709
or should I say
master of scare-i-monies?

10
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,419
(laughs)

11
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,754
(laughing)

12
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:46,880
Priceless, sir.

13
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,340
You made the word
"ceremonies" frightening.

14
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,800
I know what I did.

15
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,968
(scoffs)

16
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,928
MOE:
Hey, can we get going here?

17
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,306
Listening to you two is
more torture than the torture.

18
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,436
(grunts)

19
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,271
Actually, no, this is worse.

20
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:06,191
Although the right nipple spike
seems a little dull.

21
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,567
(grunts)

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,152
Oh, yeah.

23
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,154
Oh, that’s barbaric.

24
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,657
Whoa, look at that!

25
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,909
My blood’s a genius.

26
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,620
Fancy Roman numerals
and everything.

27
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,514
Look!

28
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,807
A shooting star!

29
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,141
Hey, that’s great.

30
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,310
Let’s look at it after.

31
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,105
Whoa!

32
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,858
That almost tore
my head off.

33
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,444
Oh, you always find an excuse
not to make out.

34
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,743
Whoo! A space marshmallow.

35
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,495
Where do you think
you’re going?

36
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,416
Dad, no!

37
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,461
It could teach us the secret
of interstellar travel.

38
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,756
If he’s so smart, how come
he can’t stay out of my mouth?

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,675
(grunting)

40
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,140
How could you
eat that goo?

41
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,517
You don’t know
what galaxy it’s from.

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,894
Marge, I ate it. It’s over.

43
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,604
Whoa. Oh, no, you don’t.

44
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,565
(snorting)

45
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,697
(snorting)

46
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,366
If I can keep down Arby’s,
I can keep down you.

47
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,161
(hooting)

48
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,414
(stomach rumbling)

49
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,004
(zombie-like):
Must eat, then poop,

50
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,006
then eat some more,

51
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,675
then eat while pooping.

52
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,343
(wind whirring)

53
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,056
(panting, grunting)

54
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,391
Still hungry.

55
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,517
BART:
Dad?

56
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,813
Son, let me have
a lick at you.

57
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,773
(both grunting)

58
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,610
Homer!

59
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,195
You won’t eat
my stuffed peppers,

60
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,946
but you’ll eat our son?

61
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,948
Nag, nag, nag.

62
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,450
(gasping for air)

63
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,286
(yowling)

64
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,579
Is that the cat?

65
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,873
Uh, no, just gas.

66
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,791
(grunting)

67
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,709
(meowing weakly)

68
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,213
Food. Ooh. Food.

69
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,797
(grunts)
Ooh!

70
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,175
(gasps)
Ooh!

71
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,593
Ooh, teenagers.

72
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,012
Mmm. Oh...

73
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,097
No, today’s teens
have enough problems

74
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,182
without me eating them.

75
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,184
Barbeque sauce fight!

76
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,269
(all squealing)

77
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,812
Oh, I gotcha!

78
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,232
(screaming)

79
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,234
The flames are sealing
in my juices.

80
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,444
I’ll savor you.

81
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,529
(gasping)

82
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,822
(all screaming)

83
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,158
Mmm. Extra-virgin.

84
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,160
(gurgling)

85
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,537
(screaming)

86
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:10,208
Tell my friends I died
kissing a girl!

87
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,584
No.

88
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,128
(gasps)

89
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,257
Ooh. Beer-battered Germans.

90
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,633
(overlapping chatter)

91
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,970
(crowd gasping)

92
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,060
What did we Germans ever do
to deserve this?

93
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,479
Oh, right.

94
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,315
Must eat more fat people.

95
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,025
Thank God I’m in America.

96
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,402

I used to think these shirts
were just for fat slobs.

110
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,764
(gunshots on TV)

111
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,771
It’s blob rule on the streets
of Springfield.

112
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,690
And to make matters worse,
we’re also being attacked

113
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,067
by a 50-foot Lenny.

114
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,944
Everyone’s paying attention
to Homer.

115
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,487
CARL:
I still like you.

116
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,905
Thanks, Invisible Carl.

117
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,491
(screaming)

118
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,368
Mmm. Mmm.

119
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,828
Mmm.

120
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,538
FLANDERS:
Hi-de-ho, Bloborino.

121
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,789
Eh. Mm.

122
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:32,915
MAN:
Homer?

123
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,042
Hmm?

124
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,252
-I need to talk to you.
-(gasps)

125
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,962
Dr. Phil McGraw!

126
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,257
You’ve got a weight problem,
and you know it.

127
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,550
You’re right.

128
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,178
Starting tomorrow,
no bread before dinner.

129
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,639
Homer, don’t sell me an outhouse
and tell me it’s the Taj Mahal.

130
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,600
Yeah, Homer,
stop doing that.

131
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,770
It’s time to open up
a can of honesty.

132
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,147
You’re thinking about eating me
right now,

133
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,398
aren’t you?

134
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,233
Aren’t you?

135
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,653
That’s ridiculous,
talking fudge.

136
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,072
Homer, your family’s here.

137
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,657
And you got to help me
help them

138
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,785
help you help me
help you.

139
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,453
Marge, I missed you.

140
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,914
All this eating has put me in
the mood for a little lovin’.

141
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,165
(purrs sexily)

142
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,251
I have to be
honest with you:

143
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,421
I can’t love
a 4,000-ton cannibal.

144
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,840
What happened to "for better
or for worse?!"

145
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,217
Dad,
you’re eating Dr. Phil.

146
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,011
It’s amazing.

147
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,222
He tastes
just like Jeffrey Tambor.

148
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,890
(grunting)

149
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,226
Food does not equal love!

150
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,481
Marge, to keep you in my life,
I’d do anything.

151
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,441
There must be some way
to turn my problem

152
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,902
into a positive
for the community.

153
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:43,903
BOTH: Hmm...
Hmm...

154
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,697
In you go, boys.

155
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,992
We’ve got everything--
warm beds, square meals,

156
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,869
homeless women.

157
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,913
(all clamoring)

158
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:57,583
I got a bad feeling
about this, Blue.

159
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,668
(sniffs)

160
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,711
(yelps)

161
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,963
Get in there.

162
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,423
(screaming)

163
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,056
Nice to be indoors, isn’t it?

164
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,936
♪♪

165
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,231
Finally, I’d like to announce

166
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,275
that starting Monday,
this show will be

167
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,735
broadcast in HDTV.

168
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,279
Here’s how I’ll look.

169
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,321
-Eh?
-(kids scream)

170
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,409
That’s right:
look at your hero!

171
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,828
(laughs)

172
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:34,912
Good night, everybody.

173
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,789
Aren’t you coming, Bart?

174
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,791
Nah, I’m gonna go
backstage and complain.

175
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,836
This Krusty Brand alarm clock
sprays acid in your face.

176
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,171
-(acid fizzes)
-Oh!

177
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,590
You already
showed me before!

178
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:50,219
Whoa, Krusty’s
prop room.

179
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,224
Cool! It’s that clown car

180
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,393
all those midgets drowned in.

181
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,061
Wha..?

182
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,024
(gasps)

183
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,067
Hey, kid.
This ain’t a museum.

184

<i>It’s burning people alive.</i>

362
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,586
(people screaming)

363
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,296
Okay, boys, we’re
under attack.

364
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,007
Let’s drive ’em out of town
the way we did with the Irish.

365
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,175
Hey, I’m Irish.

366
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,426
Oh.

367
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,886
Oh, wait, I’m Polish.

368
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,180
Oh.

369
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,265
The devastation is incredible.

370
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,559
They’re grinding up
the bodies of human beings.

371
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,144
(grinding)

372
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,729
Now they’re riding horses
in the rain.

373
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,022
-(clip clop)
-(water falling)

374
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,691
Now they’re playing
the xylophone

375
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,359
while bowling near
an airport.

376
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,533
Now, before we all die,

377
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,494
one last selection from
the Nathan Newley Orchestra.

378
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,288
(singing):
♪ I’m young and healthy ♪

379
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,874
♪ And you’ve got charms... ♪

380
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,127
Gee, Mr. Welles,

381
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,296
this sure is a swell show
you’re puttin’ on
for the folks.

382
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,924
Well, I just hope our
saucy little radio prank

383
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,219
will give these "folks," as
you call them, a giggle, a gasp,

384
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,264
and provide a good lead-in
for Misters Amos and Andy.

385
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,349
(people screaming, gunfire)

386
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,644
Burn everything.

387
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,854
You know, Homer,

388
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,856
we haven’t actually
seen these aliens.

389
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,357
That’s alien talk.

390
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,361
"Big Band Stu,"
says 23 Skidoo.

391
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,821
Ooh!

392
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,073
(a la Franklin D. Roosevelt):
We have nothing to fear

393
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,702
but the aliens and their vastly
superior killing technology.

394
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,954
Boys, we have to assume
our guns are useless.

395
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,080
Throw ’em in the lake.

396
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,167
Good. Now, the
police car.

397
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,714
Wait, did you
get my sweater

398
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:29,631
out of the front seat?

399
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,632
Uh, yeah.

400
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,259
-Well, where is it?
-(sighs)

401
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,719
I’ll go get it.

402
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,267
Wait, I have an idea.

403
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,478
The Martians are
only killing humans,

404
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,314
so we should pretend
to be animals.

405
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,940
Ingenious.

406
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,527
Everyone, remove your clothes
and wallow in filth.

407
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,532
(braying, meowing,
and barking)

408
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,242
-(meowing)
-(mooing)

409
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:01,497
(animal noises continue)

410
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,211
(clucking and meowing)

411
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,338
(barking)

412
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,173
Bow-wow.

413
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,258
What is everyone doing?

414
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,676
We’re outsmarting the Martians.

415
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,095
(braying)

416
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,054
Martians?

417
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,348
You do know that radio broadcast
was a hoax?

418
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,724
Moo?

419
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,060
Yeah, it was an Orson Welles
radio play

420
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,478
of <i>War of the Worlds.</i>

421
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,396
See.

422
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,441
-(sighing)
-(muttering)

423
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,277
I’m proud of what I achieved
during my rioting.

424
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:37,449
It was either kill him
or kill no one.

425
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,534
(Kang laughs)

426
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,661
Foolish Earthlings.

427
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,163
Now is the perfect time
to strike.

428
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,998
They’ll think
it’s another hoax.

429
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,250
(grunting)

430
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:59,388
Dad, a flying saucer
blew up that statue.

431
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,557
Lisa, that was
just a radio show.

432
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,474
Uh, Paw.

433
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:10,023
Please, you must believe me,
this is no hoax.

434
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,525
This is a real invasion.

435
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,777
Oh, yeah? Why don’t I just
punch you in the nose, Bud?

436
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,489
"Nosebud."

437
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,825
Chief, you’ve got
to alert the military.

438
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,826
Fine, fine,

439
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,869
I’ll do it right now.

440
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,120
(rings)

441
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,663
US Army. What’s the threat?

442
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,123
Uh, we’ve been invaded...

443
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,667
by a pompous, radio ham.

444
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,420
How’s it feel when the hoax
is on the other foot?

445
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,422
I must admit it’s unpleasant.

446
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,384
You fool.

447
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,469
You’ve doomed us all.

448
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,346
Eh, tell it to the Great
Gildersleeve.

449
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,973
(screams)

450
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,187
Well, they didn’t
eat the skin.

451
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,646
It’s--that’s healthy.

452
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,867
Colonel Kang, your report.

453
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,452
Uh, well...

454
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,954
the Earthlings continue
to resent our presence.

455
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,623
