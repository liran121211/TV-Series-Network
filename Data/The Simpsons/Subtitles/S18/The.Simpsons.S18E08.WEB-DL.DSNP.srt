52
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,301
Is that legal?

00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,221
Wait. What if <i>nobody </i>goes?

54
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,889
He can’t kill all of us.

55
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,935
He’s right. Individually,
we are weak like a single twig.

56

00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,101
I’ll whack you with

75

the whole salad set

76
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,396
if you don’t start

77
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,190

jumped off

would you not jump?

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,743

but you still have to go.

98
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,109
Why?

99
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,028
Son, we all have
to do things

100
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,988
we don’t want to:

101
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,825
like have jobs and families
and responsibilities

102
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,036
and having to be Mr. Funny
all the time.

103
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,705
You think I wouldn’t rather
be living nude in the forest

104
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,959
like some ancient pagan,
just dancing around

105
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,669

106
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,544

113
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,982

114
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,235

lot out there.

123
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,711

129
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,431
Hi, kids, my spidey sense
is tingling.

130
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,684
Tingling because it’s
a certain someone’s birthday.

131
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,519
Yeah!

132
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,065
Uh, where are
all the kids?

133
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,900
They’re coming!
They are!

134
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,986
I love you, Spidey!

135
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,405
Uh, listen, I only got
ten minutes of material.

136
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,866
Maybe I should come back
a little later.

137
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:25,783
Don’t go.

138
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,203
My party peeps are en route,
I swear!

139
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,666
Nelson,
nobody’s coming.

140
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,127
But how could
nobody come?

141
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,378
I ordered them to.

142
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,422
Well, that’s the thing.

143
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,550

145
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,680
but I thought
I had <i>some </i>friends.

146
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:51,142
Maybe you can have fun
with just me.

147
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,478
Okay. Why not?

148
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,438
Stop having fun, kids.

149
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,233
I’m Dr. Octopus
from Marvel Comics’ <i>Spiderman.</i>

150
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,360
I’m inventing a ray

151
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,154
that turns birthday presents
into homework.

152
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,405
Yah!

153
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,406
Come on, Bart.

154
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,033
Let’s knock him down.

155
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,578
(both grunt)

156
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,163

(both exclaiming)

161
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,971
Look at our kids,
playing like champs.

162
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,641
Yeah. How’d you afford
this kickass party?

163
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,935
Carnival ride
hit me on the head.

164
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:34,852
Hmm...

165
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,356
So how was
Nelson’s party?

166
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,273
Not bad.

167
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,860
We had pizza, cake
and then sang songs
with Nelson’s grandma.

168
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,196
But it was
a one-time thing,

169
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,198
and now I’ll never
see him again.

170
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,367
NELSON:
Hey!

171
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,618
It’s my birthday bud!

172
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,540
Yeah, yeah, it was,
uh, super fun.

173
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,582
Good times.

174
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,583
Hey, Ralph,

175
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,128
have I got
half a sandwich for you.

176
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,337
Bart, where you going?

177
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,005
I saved you a seat,

178
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,006
best friend.

179
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,007
(gasps)

180
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,386
Ha-ha!

181
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,892
Hey, best friend,
I got you a present.

182
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,603
An entire case
of pool cue chalk.

183
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,021
Huh? Huh?

184
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,399
We can make the tip
of anything blue.

185
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,984
Um, Nelson,

186
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,987
I was just thinking about us
being best friends.

187
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,197
Whoa! Me, too!

188
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,366
We are so connected!

189
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,619
Look, um, I don’t have
time for new friends.

190
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,663
I got a lot
on my plate.

191
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,124
I’ve got a big report due
on the Nile River--

192
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,376
topic sentence,
bibliography, page numbers--

193
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,586
it’s nuts.

194
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,713
-(grunts)
-Dude...

195
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,549
You made me get water
on my cheek.

196
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,345
(grunting)

197
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,264
Bart is my best friend now,

198
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,142
which means no one
picks on him ever again.

199
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,187
Okay! Okay!

200
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,856
I forgot
how cool Bart was.

201
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,441
-Yeah, he’s awesome.
-Good guy, good guy.

202
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,275
Isn’t he?

203
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,443
I’ve known him for years,

204
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,321
but I ran into him at a party
and we really clicked.

205
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,989
That’s right, we’re
best friends now.

206
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,910
So why don’t you go pick on
someone smaller and weaker?

207
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,453
Good idea!

208
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,746
Let’s go over
to the Sunshine Preschool

209
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,539
and wail on toddlers.

210
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,333
Yeah, we’ll jump ’em
while they’re napping.

211
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,212
MARGE:
Homie...

212
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,546
Huh...?

213
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,384
When you’re done putting
Lisa to bed we can, uh...

214
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,512
finish what we started
the other day.

215
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,554
Woo-hoo!

216
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,556
Marital sex!

217
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,226
Okay, tucked in tight,
glass of water,

218
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,852
nightlight on,
no barn owls,

219
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,438
don’t do drugs,
love you, good night.

220
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,857
Dad, can’t you read me
a story for a little bit?

221
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,401
But your mother
smells like coconut.

222
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,237
(groans)

223
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,657
Okay, sweetie, which
book should I read?

224
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,826
<i>Angelica Button and</i>
<i>the Dragon King’s Trundle Bed.</i>

225
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,496
It’s the ninth book in
the Angelica Button series.

226
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,164
Oh, yeah,
this is that fantasy book

227
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,541
that even grown-ups like.

228
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,751
Broken,
lonely grown-ups.

229
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,296
"Chapter One: The Ruby Stone
in the Door-Portal".

230
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,631
Are you asleep yet?

231
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,674
No.

232
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,591
(sighs)

233
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,510
"Angelica trembled

234
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,888
as she looked up at
the stern but wise whiskers

235
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,058
of Headmaster Greystash..."

236
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,812
(British accent):
Angelica Button,
you are a mere Earthkin.

237
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,023
What business have you
with the Merlinical Council?

238
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,400
I bring warning!

239
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,735
The Minister of Niceness,
Lord Evilton,

240
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,696
is not what he appears!

241
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,490
Preposterous-sss!

242
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,659
Foolish Earthkin!

243
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,413
Send her to the sorrow
mines of Mount Purgatorium.

244
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,498
No!

245
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,374
(gasps)

246
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,834
Lisa, wake up.

247
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,295
They’re taking Angelica
to Mount Purgatorium.

248
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,463
Oh, Dad, I’m tired.

249
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,507
We’ll read more tomorrow.

250
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,718
Tomorrow?
But she’s in trouble now.

251
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,261
I’ll just read ahead
without you.

252
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,556
No! We have to read
it together.

253
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,392
Oh, of course.
Whatever you say, sweetie.

254
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,435
Nighty-night.

255
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,854
(snoring softly)

256
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:05,771

257
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,610
(snoring)

258
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:18,034
NELSON:
I like to come up here
and make fun of the sunset.

259
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,536
Hey, gas ball,
you suck!

260
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,497
Nelson, do you ever wish
you weren’t a bully?

261
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,708
Mm, sometimes.

262
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,377
But it’s not up to me,
it’s who I am.

263
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:32,214
I mean, a shark can’t stop
swimming or it’ll blow up.

264
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,051
Man...
I never knew you were so deep.

268
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,893

Lisa’s sleeping

I promised Lisa
I wouldn’t.

Bart, why are you hanging
around with Nelson so much?

He’s a bully.

319
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,627
Hey, don’t use
the "B" word around me.

320
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,711
It’s offensive.

Yo, bully.

Whoa, Bart Simpson

327
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,227
Then why are you
wearing that vest?

328
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,938
Because my chest is cold
and my arms aren’t.

329
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,606
I see.

330
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,525

00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,176
The cat’s eyes are runny,
and I need you to dab ’em.

356
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,678
Coming, Ma!

357
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,140
See you later,
lying traitor!

358
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,895
Something in your eye,
Mr. Mooch?

359
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,689
Well, there’s something
in my eye, too.

360
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,065
(sobs)

361
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,486
Ma, what happened
to the curtains?

362
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,197
I made ’em into a dress
for karaoke singing.

363
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,702
Hey, Bart, do you want
some ice cream?

364
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,996
(whispers):
I just hit a major
marshmallow vein.

365
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,917
Oh! I think it goes
all the way to the bottom.

366
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,002
-No, thanks.
-What’s wrong?

367
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,295
Me and Nelson were
best friends,

368
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,880
and now I think
he’s gonna kill me!

369
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,256
Bully problem, eh?

370
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,426
You know what they say--
all bullies are cowards.

371
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:31,388
It’s not true-- they’re brave,
’cause they’re strong.

372
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,473
(groans)

373
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,020
(yells)

374
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,563
Bart, we need to talk.

375
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,981
(grunts)

376
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,818
I feel so bad about
freaking out on you.

377
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,862
It’ll never happen
again, I swear.

378
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,365
Um... okay.

379
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,158
Best friends?

380
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,493
Forever?

381
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,078
No!
I can’t do it.

382
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,246
You’re a nut bar,
a whack job!

383
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,456
A kooka-dooka!

384
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,333
Please, just
leave me alone.

385
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,960
Best not to get
involved.

386
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,002
Agreed.

387
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,589
(whimpers)

388
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,675
Looks like you’ve
made your choice.

389
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,469
Make sure your affairs
are in order.

390
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,679
I’ve set up a trust.

391
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,764
It bypasses the inheritance tax.

392
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,350
Only till 2008.
Look into it!

393
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,646
(sobbing):
Oh...

394
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,731
Oh, Greystash...

395
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,525
Greystash!

396
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,985
Oh, hello, Lisa.

397
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,736
Come on, Dad, read
the last chapter.

398
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,530
Everyone says there’s
a big surprise.

399
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,825
I bet Angelica discovers
that <i>she’s </i>a wizard.

400
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,119
Uh... how would you feel

401
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,955
if something bad happened
to Greystash?

402
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,373
It would be the day
my childhood ended.

403
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,374
(screams)

404
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,126
Come on, read, read!

405
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,961
(whimpering):
Mm... mm...

406
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,630
"Angelica was trapped
in the Suffoclock

407
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,173

408
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,967
Time to choose, Greystash.

409
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,554
If you save Angelica,
you die!

410
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,972
Why are you stopping?

411
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,975
We’re almost
at the happy ending.

412

<i>HOMER:</i>
<i>No book is gonna make</i>

413

<i>lie to a child!</i>

414
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,026

Oh, man, I can’t believe
you beat me, but you did.

421
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,385
I somehow escaped
from the hourglass!

422
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,765
And now,
to go on living!

423
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,185
(laughing, cheering)

424
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,647
The End.

425
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,984
Is that really how it ends?

426
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,736
What happened
to the Merlinical Council?

427
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,530
Uh... they went
to Star Wars Land

428
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,823
and fought star wars.

429
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,077
Dad, you can read

Eh... Dad’s ending is better.

433
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,053
Okay, field-trippers,

434
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,388
welcome to the Springfield
Tide Pools,

435
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,974
nature’s most fecund
ecosystem.

436
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,643
Who will spot
the playful abalone?

437
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,895
The mighty winkle?

438
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,563
I think it might be you, Sherri.

439
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,065
(gasps)

440
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,650
Now, remember, these pools
can be dangerous,

441
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,734
so everyone pick a buddy.

442
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,363
Bart’s <i>my </i>buddy.

443
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,531
Good boy, Nelson.

444
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,366
Squeeze him extra
tight for safety.

445
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,202
Ah...

446
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,954
We sure are far from
the rest of ’em.

447
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,288
(nervous chuckle)

448
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,415
Funny how that
happened, huh?

449
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,251
-Come with me.
-(Bart whimpers)

450
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,502
(grunts)

451
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,045
Nelson, please
don’t kill me.

452
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,422
Remember when we made
fun of Cinco de Mayo?

453
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,926
I called it "Stinko de Mayo."
We laughed so hard.

454
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,469
Bart...

455
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,597
you are a bad friend.

456
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,474
S-Say again?

457
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,476
You never liked me for <i>me.</i>

458
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,062
You liked that I protected you
and gave you a vest

459
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,022
and stole milk boxes
for you.

460
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,315
I hate milk!

461
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,859
It comes
from cow wangs!

462
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,277
There you go again.

463
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,863
You act all nice,
and then you go crazy.

464
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,823
Well, maybe
I get jealous.

465
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,992
But it’s just because...

466
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,995
I never had
a best friend before.

467
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,834
Um, Nelson, was the water
always up to our necks?

468
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,252
(water rushing)

469
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,545
Nelson?

470
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,046
Help! Help!

471
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,256
Put this on.

472
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,674
Where did you get it?

473
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:36,758
Dude gave it to me.

474
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,948

475
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,286

giving him CPR,

479
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,879
And if anyone loves Bart,
it’s Nelson.

480
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,339
Where <i>is </i>Nelson?

481
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,174
I’m sorry, Nelson
never woke up.

482
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,009
-What?!
-Never woke up,
because...

483
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,595
he never passed out--
he’s right over there.

486

Course I saved you--
you’re my field trip buddy.

00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,104
And <i>nothing </i>else.

488
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,105
You mean...?

489
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,232
Exactly.

490
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,192

Gee, you’re really upset
about this Greystash thing.

501
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,032
Don’t say his name.
