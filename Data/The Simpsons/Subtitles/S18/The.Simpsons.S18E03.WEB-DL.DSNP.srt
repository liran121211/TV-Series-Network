no peanut products

the sound of a
woman measuring.

173
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,338
Oh, uh, that was me.

174
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,881
You know that old saying:

175
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,592
"Measure like a girl,
hammer like a guy."

176
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,095
Yes, but you’re holding
your hammer backwards.

177
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,888
Oh, uh... you know
what they say,

178
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,432
"Hammer with the wood,
and it’s all good."

179
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,684
It’s all good.

180
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,644
All right, then.

A dash of glue,

183
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,240
a turn of screw,

184
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:32,994
and a gazebo’s built that’s
perfect for two...

185
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,078
or more.

186
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,623
Uh-oh! Switch!

187
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,500
Eh... eh... eh!

188
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,085
And... done!

189
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,253
Mm-mmm!

190
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,130
Simpson, you’re
a master craftsman.

191
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,132
Listen,
what would you say

192
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,093
if I told you a woman
did most of the work?

193
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,013
I’d have this gazebo torn down
and built into a coffin...

194
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,848
-for your manhood.
-(shrieks)

195
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,809
Why did my hypothetical
scenario scare you so?

196
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:01,439
Uh, like all manly men,
I have a vivid imagination.

197
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,690
Well said.

198
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,108
Let’s take off our shirts
and wrestle.

199
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,278
(both grunting)

200
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,616
GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE:
Okay,

201
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,451
give me all your peanuts,

202
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,995
Goobers, and Fluffer Nutters.

203
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:19,207
Oh, why should <i>we </i>have
to give up our salty snacks

204
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,459
just to keep one allergic kid
from exploding?

205
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,377
Who is this selfish jerk
anyway?

206
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,421
It’s not me--I swear.

207
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,008
I’m only allergic to honey,
wheat, dairy, non-dairy,

208
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,593
and my own tears.

209
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,303
(sobs)

210
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,387
Oh, no.

211
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,431
Call my allergist...

212
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,974
and my optometrist.

213
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,017
(all laughing)

214
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,562
Willie, you can tell me.

215
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,190
Who’s the mystery wuss
who can’t eat peanuts?

216
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,900
I’ll never say his name.

217
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,068
"His," eh?

218
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,362
Hmm, so it’s a dude.

219
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,531
Who says it’s a dude?

220
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,825
A principal can be a man
or a woman these days.

221
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,202
Hmm.

222
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,040
I’ve taken all the
peanut products.

223
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,959
Just like the English
took our sheep

224
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,711
and our women in 1291.

225
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,798
Then, they sent them back,
which was worse!

226
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,717
Yes, yes,
every day we go through this.

227
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,928
Why don’t you
just incinerate the contraband?

228
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,056
Will do, but first,
Willie gets his gob-full.

229
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,686
Careful
with those peanut crumbs!

230
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,521
My allergy is so sensitive,
a single molecule

231
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,274
would make my throat close
like a museum at 4:45.

232
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,275
(gasps)

233
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,280
Hello, Marge.

234
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,949
Picking up supplies
for Handy Homer?

235
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,618
It must feel good to know
that you’re "helping."

236
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,745
Oh, I help more than
you might think.

237
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,497
Sure you do.

238
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,291
You provide food
and sexual release

239
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,542
for your handy husband.

240
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,543
(grunts angrily)

241
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,627
Looks like
you broke something.

242
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,628
Better call Homer!

243
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,130
(both laughing)

244
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,257
(groans)

245
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:56,387
Of course I can make a credenza,
whatever that is.

246
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,141
Just give all the details
to my secretary Shirley.

247
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,309
This is Shirley.

248
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,643
Yes, fine,
he’ll be there tomorrow.

249
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,270
Goodbye.

250
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,314
That Shirley
is quite a gal.

251
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,941
-We should fix her up
with Barney.
-Homie...

252
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,153
I think you’re taking a little
too much credit for my work.

253
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,529
I mean, look at
your t-shirt!

254
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,035
Marge, giving me credit
was your idea.

255
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,078
Now, could you
rub my butt?

256
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,331
I sat on it so much
it’s a little sore.

257
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,457
Oh...!

258
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,375
Look, I’m sorry
you’re upset,

259
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,002
but if we tell the truth now,

260
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,130
I’ll be humiliated
in front of the whole town.

261
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,174
Then you won’t be married
to a man.

262
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:36,344
You’ll be married
to some kind of gay jellyfish

263
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,054
floating
outside the Florida Keys,

264
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,473
cruising for rich snorkelers.

265
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,016
You don’t want that.

266
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,810
I guess I don’t.

267
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,020
(sighs)

268
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,404
Bart, Skinner’s going
to be really mad at you.

269
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:59,200
Yes, you might say
he’ll "blow up."

270
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,077
(laughs evilly)

271
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,078
Whatever.

272
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,330
I’ve got some paper
to mâché.

273
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,331
(grunts)

274
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,417
Simpson!

275
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,169
Report to
detention at once.

276
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,005
Ah, I’m not a big fan
of detention.

277
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,341
You might say
it drives me <i>nuts.</i>

278
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,384
(gasps)

279
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,761
My allergen.

280
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,056
<i>♪ Beat on the brat,</i>
<i>beat on the brat ♪</i>

281

00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,030
I’ve been one all my life.

286
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,824
<i>I like the cooties so much,</i>

287
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:40,908

288
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,413
(groans)

289
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,582
Why does Lenny need
a windmill, anyway?

290
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,668
Ah, he wants
to grind his own corn.

291
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,461
Maybe it’ll finally shut him up

292
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,630
about the high price
of cornmeal.

293
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,090
Oh, switch.

294
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,218
(grumbling):
Oh, yeah,
switch, switch, switch.

295
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,678
Wow, great
job, Homer.

296
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,889
Yeah, and to think you
built this whole thing
with your own two hands.

297
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,684
Who do you think would help me,
my wife?

298
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,810
Your wife?

299
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,437
(scoffs)
Give me a break.

300
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,856
The only thing women can
build is credit card debt.

301
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,190
(both laughing)

302
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,650
Credit card debt.

303
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,318
(muffled yelling)

304
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,404
Homer, did you leave a power
drill on in your toolbox?

305
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,780
It’s making
this horrible noise.

306
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,073
Yeah, I hear it, too.

307
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,576
Maybe we can cover it up
by singing a fun song.

308
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,579

309

I’m sorry, infinity.

316
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,142
I never expected them
to climb on the cabinet

317
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,144
and ride it down the
biggest hill in town.

318
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,771
(groans)

319
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,316
Homer, it’s time
people knew the truth.

320
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,358
I’m doing the work

321
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,277
and I want the credit.

322
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,780
Look, I understand
that you’re mad.

323
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,114
Which makes now
the perfect time

324
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,200
to tell you the mayor’s
hired us to fix

325
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,701
the old Springfield
roller coaster.

326
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,330
(dramatic music)

327
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,583
By the way, nice job installing
this wall-chart bracket.

328
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,211
(loud whisper):
If the kids ask,
I did it.

329
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,254
(groans)
You’re gonna
have to fix

330
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,257
that roller coaster
yourself, ’cause I quit,

331
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,260
and I’m taking this with me!

332
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,263
(groaning)

333
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,682
Darn these countersunk
molly clamps.

334
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,103
(cats screeching)

335
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,522
This is not going
to end well.

336
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,695
Now, as I see it, the problem
with this roller coaster

337
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,573
is there are too many
boring going-up parts.

338
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,785
We need to replace them
with kick-ass going-down parts.

339
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,786
(men murmuring)

340
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,704
Oh, yeah,
going-down parts.

341
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,957
Uh, Mr. Simpson, shouldn’t we
begin by securing the struts?

342
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,708
Hmm...

343
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,878
Let me mull that over.

344
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,714
(Homer sobbing loudly)

345
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,424
What are struts?!

346
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,844
(wailing): Oh...

347
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,055
(sobbing):
Oh, I don’t know

348
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,890
anything about struts.

349
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,269
This guy’s all
bubble and no level.

350
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,021
So what? He’s paying
us 50 grand.

351
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,232
HOMER (sobbing):
And I promised these guys
money I don’t have!

352
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,443
And they’re gonna be so mad!

353
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,612
(sobbing loudly)

354
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,698
Ah, let’s go home.

355
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,243
Maybe I can sneak home

356
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,036
without them seeing me.

357
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,038

361
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,096

Are you ready to be
lightly assaulted?

362
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:49,930

363
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:50,848

Mm.

367
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,023

Good morning.

368
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,274
(groans)

369
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,901
I brought you breakfast in bed.

370
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,152
Ugh!

371
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,446
Eat it.

372
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,871
(clears throat)
Excuse me.

373
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,789
I’m supposed to stand
in your store window

374
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,083
and breast-feed
Bilbo Baggins.

375
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,003
Your cowering suggests that
Bart has found your kryptonite.

376
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,212
Kryptonite?
What’s that?

377
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,256
The "ite" suffix
suggests a mineral.

378
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,842
I do not know whether to laugh
or cry at your ignorance.

379
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,427
I shall laugh. Ha-ha!

380
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,388
Kryptonite is Superman’s
greatest weakness.

381
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,725
Wait, maybe Bart
has a kryptonite!

382
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,143
Perhaps.

383
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,395
But for now, you may
suckle your Baggins.

384
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,158
(muffled):
I’ve got you now, Bart.

385
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,787
Mm-hmm.

386
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,746
(groans): Hmm.

387
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,421

388
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,799

00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,425
(making siren noises)

390
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,135
Dad, here’s
a thought:

391
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,389
If you just gave Mom credit,
maybe she could help you.

392
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,224
Sweetie, you
don’t understand.

393
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,309
If I can do this myself,

394
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,812
then all those lies
I told will be true.

395
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,523
Don’t you want
Daddy’s lies to be true?

396
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,025
I’d like a daddy who lived
in the real world.

397
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,027
To Daddy,
the real world

398
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,280
gets fainter and fainter
every day.

399
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,198
(groans)

400
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,117
Good morning, Seymour.

401
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,743
You may be wondering

402
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,079
what I’m doing with
this hat full of maggots.

403
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,539
Actually, I’m not
wondering at all.

404
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,629
Simpson, you’ve been
waving your nuts in
my face for too long.

405
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,047
Eat shrimp and die!

406
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,383
No! I’m allergic!

407
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,093
Stick-on-stick.

408
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,302
Just like the
knights of old.

409
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,680

you won’t get married

Put aside your selfish male ego

440
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,759
and tell the truth!

441
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,428
Sure, I’ll tell them the truth.

442
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,097
The truth is...

Homer, I was
pretty upset with you,

end, I... I...

under all that rubble:

471
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,852
Marriage is the real
roller coaster.

472
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,521

you as my safety bar.

save your principal,
