1
00:00:00,515 --> 00:00:03,500
<i>Este es "El Show de Mencia"</i>

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,950
<i>Este es "El Show de Mencia"</i>

3
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:08,471
What is this?

4
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:10,515
Stop! Stop! Stop!

5
00:00:11,182 --> 00:00:13,000
What? Am I
"The Resident Beaner" now?

6
00:00:13,284 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm supposed to
sit around and tell jokes

7
00:00:15,078 --> 00:00:16,948
about burritos and tacos?

8
00:00:17,068 --> 00:00:18,528
Don't forget piñatas!

9
00:00:21,057 --> 00:00:22,447
Are you kidding me?

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,174
No! This is not me!

11
00:00:25,857 --> 00:00:27,000
This is me!

12
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:47,889
Thank you.

13
00:00:52,254 --> 00:00:53,830
Thank you.

14
00:00:55,262 --> 00:00:57,452
We got a show! We got a show!

15
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:01,250
Hey. I'm Carlos Mencia and
welcome to the "Mind of Mencia".

16
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:03,347
By the way...
Oh, thank you.

17
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:05,232
Yes.

18
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:08,135
The Beaner got a show!

19
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:12,000
I want you guys to know
that the fence aroud here

20
00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:13,688
is not just for decoration.

21
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:18,484
This is the actual fence that my mom and
dad jumped when they came to this country.

22
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:23,478
"Is he already making fun of people?"

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,000
I make fun of everybody.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I got Muslims pissed-off.

25
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:31,554
"Why are the American
people messing with me?"

26
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,830
Because, Ahmed, it's your turn!

27
00:01:36,558 --> 00:01:39,558
America's a giant game of "Tag",
somebody's always "it".

28
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,150
And, guess what,
Ahmed: you're "it"!

29
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:46,021
Here's what happened:
a lot of people don't understand.

30
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,232
September 11th: bad day in American
history, great day for Blacks and Hispanics.

31
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:53,265
Greatest day of our generation.

32
00:01:53,273 --> 00:01:55,864
'Cause on that day white
people accepted us as Americans.

33
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:58,065
Before that we weren't Americans.

34
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:00,715
Then on the 11th the buildings collapse,

35
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,570
they show the pictures of the hijackers.

36
00:02:02,673 --> 00:02:05,580
When they show those pictures
Maria, Laquisha, Carlos and Tyrone

37
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,580
walked up to
Ahmed and went: "Tag!"

38
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,897
"Your turn!"

39
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:18,835
"You are over there just to steal our oil!"

40
00:02:19,326 --> 00:02:20,180
Come on!

41
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,550
That's the problem with people:
you don't understand Americans.

42
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:25,519
Americans are not small.
We think big.

43
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,319
Not ********take a little.

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,063
Listen, listen, Ahmed. Look at me.
I know you're watching right now. Look at me.

45
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:38,376
Put the "huluh" down. Look at me.

46
00:02:40,554 --> 00:02:44,554
Oil is about that much money in comparison
to how much we're gonna fuck you out of

47
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,885
when we'll open up Wallmart.

48
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,827
"You're not going to bring Wallmart here!"

49
00:02:50,827 --> 00:02:53,355
We'll bring in all our
corporations, Ahmed, and in two months

50
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:56,355
you will be wearing
a turban with a Nike swoosh.

51
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,510
He will.

52
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:02,766
Oh, no, no, this is just real.

53
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,637
This is just real.

54
00:03:04,637 --> 00:03:08,117
Hey, listen: I know you guys
are clapping, but I'm telling you:

55
00:03:08,117 --> 00:03:10,200
Do you know that they
just opened up a McDonald's?

56
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,149
That they just opened up a
Subway Sandwich Shop in Irak?

57
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,847
I kid you not.
A Subway Sandwich Shop!

58
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,370
I don't know what those
commercials are gonna be

59
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,574
'cause I don't think Jared
is gonna go over there.

60
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:23,381
They'll have Jihad or
something: "Jihad: Alalalala!"

61
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,881
"Subway sandwiches:
they are the BOOOMB!"

62
00:03:27,926 --> 00:03:30,598
"They will blow you away!"

63
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:34,827
You know what's gotta
be cool? Just to see commercials.

64
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:37,404
You know what I mean? 'Cause
they're gonna be like ours, but different.

65
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:38,676
That's gotta be hilarious.

66
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,673
It's gotta be a guy that's
gonna run in an overcrowded room.

67
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:42,027
Then he's gonna go: "Allah*****!"

68
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,999
He's gonna pull a cord,
but nothing happens.

69
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,581
Then he's gonna go:
"Allah****!"

70
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:47,500
He'll pull another cord,
and nothing happens.

71
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:50,731
Then you're gonna hear:
"Wanna Get Away?" (airline slogan)

72
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:59,067
Oh, stop, stop!

73
00:04:00,904 --> 00:04:02,920
What? I don't care.
I make fun of anybody.

74
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,490
It's America. That's what
people don't understand.

75
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,537
You want me to tell you
what does piss me off?

76
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,067
Getting checked at the airport.

77
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,200
That's what annoys me.

78
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,255
Why am I getting
checked at the airport?

79
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:13,247
Why are white people
getting checked at the airport?

80
00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:15,468
'Cause America
doesn't have the balls

81
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:17,731
to treat Ahmed the way
we treated every other minority?

82
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,419
Now we gotta pretend?
That's bullshit!

83
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,039
Let ME be the TSA agent.

84
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:24,539
Please! Let me be
the guy at the airport!

85
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,770
I wanna be the guy that says:
listen, the rules have changed:

86
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,331
anybody that's not a Muslim,

87
00:04:29,331 --> 00:04:32,394
doesn't go "alala" and doesn't have
a "hhh" in the middle of their name

88
00:04:32,394 --> 00:04:36,265
go directly to your plane.
Just go to your planes.

89
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,970
And then I'll put the
pictures of the hijackers.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,953
So, when Ahmed goes: "Why are you
only checking people that look like me?"

91
00:04:40,953 --> 00:04:44,050
Good question.
Look at the pictures!

92
00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:49,326
You look like Number 3
and Number 10. Check him twice!

93
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:01,383
Because America is like a fraternity.

94
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:04,757
In order to join our
country you must get hazed.

95
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:08,686
And, guess what,
Ahmed, it's Greek Week.

96
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,946
There's a lot of Beaners in here. You didn't
go to college, so you didn't get that joke.

97
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,013
"What's that a Greek Week?"
Whatever.

98
00:05:23,936 --> 00:05:26,316
Everybody went through it.
That's what I don't understand.

99
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,016
I'm not afraid of
people calling me a racist.

100
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:30,578
Go ahead and call me
a racist. Go ahead and do it.

101
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:32,725
"Hey, that's not fair
you're only checking me."

102
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:34,460
"Why don't you
check the women?"

103
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,588
Well, because women
in this country, Ahmed,

104
00:05:36,697 --> 00:05:39,338
were treated like
crap for about 150 years

105
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,510
when they couldn't vote.

106
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,695
So, unless you wanna
NOT vote for that long

107
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:44,531
and, possibly, give me head

108
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:48,177
I suggest you:
get your ass over there!

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,500
What?

110
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:51,849
Right?

111
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,399
"Why don't you
check the black people?"

112
00:05:58,304 --> 00:06:00,852
And how many gold medals
have you won for us lately?

113
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:06,373
See? Shaniqua:
"************"

114
00:06:08,723 --> 00:06:10,427
She does!

115
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:14,234
"Then why don't you
check the white people?"

116
00:06:14,234 --> 00:06:17,255
Because they gave me the job!

117
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:22,026
"Then why don't you check the
Hispanics? Is it because you're Hispanic?"

118
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:24,115
No, it's because
Hispanics don't blow shit up.

119
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,711
They clean it up and build
it up after you blow it up!

120
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,110
What?

121
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:37,659
And, by the way, even if a
Wetback did hijack a plane,

122
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:41,419
where is he going?
He's already here!

123
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:44,086
What? Is he gonna
hijack a plane at LAX:

124
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,812
"We're going to Burbank!"

125
00:06:49,814 --> 00:06:52,816
"That's not even that far."
"But I don't have a car!"

126
00:06:52,816 --> 00:06:55,434
"Take it easy.
Relax. Relax."

127
00:06:59,818 --> 00:07:02,929
A lot of you, people, are gonna be
offended by something I say tonight.

128
00:07:03,234 --> 00:07:05,781
If we didn't get
to you yet, don't worry:

129
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:09,691
there's a lot more
show left. We'll be right back.

130
00:07:46,786 --> 00:07:48,808
Welcome back to "Mind of Mencia".

131
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:51,375
I am Carlos Mencia, for
those of you who don't know me.

132
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,967
I'm the 17th of 18 kids, okay?

133
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:57,579
My mom was basically
a uterus with a head.

134
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:02,742
I was the 17th born.
My mom had 16 kids

135
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,729
before I did, with no
C-sections, no multiple births.

136
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,064
I'm not saying she
was "loose" or anything.

137
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:10,860
But, by the time I got there,

138
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,645
it was a slipping slide.

139
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,641
She didn't even know I was born.

140
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:17,456
I was hanging
from the cord like a piñata.

141
00:08:17,635 --> 00:08:21,818
And my brothers were like:
"How come the candies don't come out?"

142
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,580
I can't tell you
how I survived, but I'm here.

143
00:08:26,647 --> 00:08:29,076
And I got fans and
they're the best in the world.

144
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:34,876
And you, guys, send me...
Oh, thank you, thank you guys.

145
00:08:37,678 --> 00:08:40,118
And the cool thing is
you, guys, let me know it.

146
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,991
You send me mail all the time.

147
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,926
And I just have two words, man:

148
00:08:43,926 --> 00:08:45,926
spell-check.

149
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:50,549
Look, I honestly think

150
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:53,810
that a great way for you guys
out there to get to know me

151
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,499
is by hearing one of these letters.
So, I asked a really good friend of mine, Peter,

152
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:59,735
to see if he can read
one of my favorites.

153
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,564
"Dear Carlos,

154
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:16,874
I have seen you perform 27 times,

155
00:09:16,874 --> 00:09:19,259
more than any other comedian.

156
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:22,752
I brought my wife,
my brother and even my parents.

157
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:25,114
And I honestly have to say:

158
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,712
your act sucks!

159
00:09:29,147 --> 00:09:31,378
I, too, am a Latino

160
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:35,898
and find your
stereotyping of our race disgusting,

161
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:39,373
as I told my pregnant wife and 8 kids.

162
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,046
I'm as liberal and
open minded as the next guy,

163
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,151
but I just can't tolerate
you, California Queers!

164
00:09:51,564 --> 00:09:57,082
The one thing that lets me sleep in night
is knowing you'll never end up on television

165
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,822
- maybe basic cable.

166
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,454
Carlos Mencia,
you're a racist spic!

167
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:14,304
Go fuck yourself!

168
00:10:25,902 --> 00:10:28,529
Sincerely, Michael Hernandez.

169
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:36,279
Peter Boyle!

170
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,080
Thank you.

171
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,167
You never saw that on "Rain Man".

172
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:46,287
All right.

173
00:10:47,017 --> 00:10:51,507
All across the country you, guys,
have road signs that look like this:

174
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:56,483
I live in southern California and near
the border we have a very unique road sign.

175
00:10:56,896 --> 00:10:59,166
What the hell is this?

176
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:12,368
Nobody seems to know
exactly what it means.

177
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:16,355
So I went on a
mission for you to find out.

178
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:25,144
What does the sign mean to you?

179
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:26,552
It was so fast I didn't see it.

180
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,187
Have you ever seen this sign, bro?

181
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:32,713
No, this is the first time I ever had
the opportunity to lay an eye on this sign.

182
00:11:32,713 --> 00:11:35,165
What is this sign
supposed to actually mean?

183
00:11:35,298 --> 00:11:37,017
"There's people
running across the road."

184
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:41,841
Maybe it's telling them: "Run across
the freeway, but just do it really fast."

185
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:43,600
What kind of people
do you think they are?

186
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,962
I'm not gonna say!

187
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,476
Well, they have no
afro-s, so they're not black.

188
00:11:48,034 --> 00:11:53,536
Mr. Hogarth, are you familiar with
the sign "W54 Special Pedestrian Crossing"?

189
00:11:53,536 --> 00:11:58,556
Yes, I am. I think is probably one of
the better signs that we do have in our collection.

190
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:01,369
What are these
silhouettes intended to depict?

191
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:02,755
Just a family unit.

192
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:06,235
Pretty much; basically
anyone that may reside in California.

193
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,285
What kind of family
are they meant to depict?

194
00:12:09,285 --> 00:12:11,687
Just a small family; they're
maybe on their way to the beach.

195
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,367
What do you think this sign means?

196
00:12:14,197 --> 00:12:15,660
"Watch out for people crossing the border?!"

197
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,811
-What makes you think they're immigrants?
-Because it's the daddy...

198
00:12:19,677 --> 00:12:21,581
The family takes the kids and they run.

199
00:12:23,155 --> 00:12:26,298
Who is this sign intended to warn?

200
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,806
Anyone is at risk when
they're trying to cross the freeway,

201
00:12:28,806 --> 00:12:32,522
regardless of national origin, or ethnicity...
- But who's getting hit?

202
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:36,550
When was the last time you heard a guy
from Denmark getting hit on a San Diego freeway?

203
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:40,959
I don't have that information. I don't think
it's ever been presented to me in any official form.

204
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,547
What if we actually made it
look more authentic Mexican?

205
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:49,329
If you look at the sign,
the mom's holding the kid.

206
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:51,515
He's like jamming.

207
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:53,882
Yeah, he's not even
caring about the mom or the kid.

208
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:55,503
The guy is running from them.

209
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:57,109
Child support issues maybe?

210
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,198
If he can get away
with it, you know, why not?

211
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,150
Later on he's just by himself.

212
00:13:01,152 --> 00:13:03,183
- ¿Maneja?
- No.

213
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,278
- Ah, entonces
no maneja, no lo ha visto.

214
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:07,636
- No.
- Gracias.

215
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:09,669
The sign doesn't work.

216
00:13:09,841 --> 00:13:12,086
He didn't even see it when he crossed.

217
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:15,895
He's a Wetback.
Probably got hit by a car himself.

218
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:19,389
- It's obviously for immigrants.
- No.

219
00:13:19,851 --> 00:13:22,811
And you know,
it would be wrong for us to attempt

220
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:25,539
to identify any specific group.
- So how many white people have been hit

221
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:29,432
on those freeways that they are
actually a statistic that we would say:

222
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:30,909
we wanna save white people through it.

223
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:32,061
So you think that's a baby?

224
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:33,883
Could it be something different?

225
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,327
Could it be a midget? Look at that.

226
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,783
Hey, grab his hand.
We're doing the thing.

227
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,500
Like right here.

228
00:13:40,715 --> 00:13:43,730
No, she ain't holding on, dude.
You're running away from her, dog.

229
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:49,587
Seriously. You know what?
Turn off the camera. Seriously.

230
00:13:51,225 --> 00:13:53,782
This is just between you
and me. Who's the sign for?

231
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:56,209
- Who is the sign for?
- Who's the sign for?

232
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,020
Wetbacks.

233
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:04,689
Now you know who it's for.

234
00:14:04,838 --> 00:14:06,565
It's for Wetbacks!

235
00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:10,078
Run, mojado, run!

236
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:11,796
We'll be right back.

237
00:14:19,077 --> 00:14:22,802
You, in the cave,
come out with your hands up!

238
00:14:25,193 --> 00:14:27,133
Not going anywhere for a while?

239
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,457
Why wait? Have a Snickers.

240
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:31,828
The favorite
last meal of terrorists

241
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:33,299
everywhere.

242
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:39,823
*******

243
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:43,355
*******

244
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,668
How do you build the
world's largest wireless network

245
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,539
*******

246
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:50,021
by occupying one country at the time,

247
00:14:50,183 --> 00:14:51,183
*******

248
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:53,636
until no matter where you are

249
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:58,093
you can't occupy it without us?

250
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:16,714
Listen. My wife reads these celebrity
magazines all the time. And I swear

251
00:15:16,724 --> 00:15:20,018
she could pretty much spend
the rest of her life on top of a toilet

252
00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:22,261
and not have the time
to read all this stuff.

253
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,756
So, I'm gonna do for
you what I do for her:

254
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:29,345
I'm gonna condens
all of it into 3 minutes, OK?

255
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,135
We call this "The Celebrity Ticker", all right?

256
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:38,645
Start the clock. Let's go!

257
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,272
Aaa! Poly wants a crack pipe!

258
00:15:43,684 --> 00:15:47,123
Oh, she's been with a black guy,
a white guy, a Cuban and a Portorican,

259
00:15:47,123 --> 00:15:49,406
so, if she's gonna break up
with him, Asians are gonna be like:

260
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,565
"Oooh, we're next!"

261
00:15:51,656 --> 00:15:52,868
Next!

262
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:57,623
Wink if you haven't
eaten in 3 months!

263
00:15:58,112 --> 00:15:58,897
Next!

264
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:02,263
Oh, he's been
complaining, Stevie Wonder has,

265
00:16:02,263 --> 00:16:05,742
about violence in videos.

266
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,491
He can't see the freakin' video!

267
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:16,953
Next!

268
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:19,684
That's just an oxymoron!

269
00:16:26,356 --> 00:16:30,400
That's kinda like when ugly chicks
wear shirts that say: "Cutie".

270
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,559
Next!

271
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:35,785
Oh, she said that
she wants to stay a virgin

272
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:37,517
until she gets married.

273
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:41,749
Hey, not gonna be a problem there.

274
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:47,597
What?

275
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:49,499
Next!

276
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:52,031
"How many times do I have to tell you:"

277
00:16:52,031 --> 00:16:56,683
"I am not hiding any
weapons of mass destruction!"

278
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:58,755
Next!

279
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:02,715
All right, not a big surprise. Come on,

280
00:17:02,715 --> 00:17:06,418
I've seen her many times
in all forms with meat in her mouth.

281
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:11,036
Next!

282
00:17:11,424 --> 00:17:13,090
You still suck!

283
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,346
Next!

284
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:23,935
Raise your hand if
you wanna bowl on Carlos Mencia.

285
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:27,129
Next!

286
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:32,565
"E.T., phone home!"

287
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:34,935
Next!

288
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,037
How much time do I have left?

289
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:40,488
All right. Michael Jackson -
I am so glad that he got off

290
00:17:40,488 --> 00:17:43,924
so now that we can put in jail
the people that really deserve to be there:

291
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:47,055
parents that actually
take their kids to his house.

292
00:17:47,353 --> 00:17:52,486
Even if you don't believe this man
is a pedophile, he fits the profile:

293
00:17:52,486 --> 00:17:55,317
he lives in Neverland,
he calls himself Peter Pan,

294
00:17:55,317 --> 00:17:58,232
his entire estate is built
to atract children to it.

295
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,868
You do not take your kids
to Michael Jackson's house.

296
00:18:00,868 --> 00:18:03,775
I don't even take my kids to church!

297
00:18:04,412 --> 00:18:08,119
No! No! Oh, no!
It is not over!

298
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:11,219
Look, I think Michael
Jackson bangs little kids.

299
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:13,308
Have you seen him dance?
Watch him dance:

300
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:16,023
he staps his fingers
and he gets their attention;

301
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:17,955
then he calls'em over.

302
00:18:18,214 --> 00:18:20,710
Then, when they're getting
close he starts getting happy.

303
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:24,561
Then, when their heads
are right there - Bam! Bam!

304
00:18:24,764 --> 00:18:27,200
And then: "Aooooo!"

305
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,495
Now I'm done.
We'll be right back.

306
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:43,824
Welcome back to "Mind of Mencia"

307
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:46,392
This is actually
my favorite part of the show.

308
00:18:46,632 --> 00:18:48,433
I watch so much television

309
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,818
and I so often find myself thinking:

310
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:54,877
"Why the fuck is this news?"

311
00:18:57,563 --> 00:19:00,211
How slow of a news day
does it really need to be

312
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:03,102
in order for this
to end up on television?

313
00:19:03,102 --> 00:19:05,706
"Big searches on this
afternoon in the North Shore."

314
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:10,815
-"Three big birds escaped..."
- Nobody can see back there a dumbass?

315
00:19:15,372 --> 00:19:17,464
"Anna, this is about emus?"

316
00:19:17,464 --> 00:19:20,527
"- Emus. Exactely...."
Woo, big birds!

317
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:26,883
"...they tell me by a professional emu wrangler..."
There's a "professional"!

318
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,642
No one knows where it is. They're
taping it, somebody knows where it is!

319
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,139
"...because these birds run really fast..."
Yeah, look how fast it's running.

320
00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:38,139
Oooh, it's running fast!

321
00:19:38,923 --> 00:19:43,240
"...the Animal Control, *** police,
Glencoe police, Protecting Guard and..."

322
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:46,533
Stop! Stop! Did you hear
how many people are chasing a bird?

323
00:19:47,078 --> 00:19:49,802
It's a bird! It can fly!

324
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,341
Why don't you tell the black people
that there's a giant chicken on the loose

325
00:19:53,406 --> 00:19:59,182
and 2 minutes later we'll have a bucket
of big-ass wings? Come on! Come on!

326
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,328
No!

327
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,751
That's on the News? Come on!

328
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:10,996
This is what should've been
on the News, and you didn't see it

329
00:20:10,996 --> 00:20:14,203
but we'll show it to you
here, on "Mind of Mencia":

330
00:20:20,624 --> 00:20:25,177
Look at that! Ooo! Ooo!

331
00:20:25,614 --> 00:20:26,585
Dude!

332
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:32,351
We voted this guy,
and not once, but twice!

333
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,902
That's our President!

334
00:20:41,524 --> 00:20:42,886
And that's our show.

335
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,250
Thank you for watching.

336
00:20:44,622 --> 00:20:47,663
Thank you guys for being here.
Thank you so much.

337
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,764
Let's thank Peter Boyle.

338
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:55,265
