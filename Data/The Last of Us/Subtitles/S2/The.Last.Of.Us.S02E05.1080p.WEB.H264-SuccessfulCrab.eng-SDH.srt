Okay. Who?

216
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,170
When I was little,
we lived in a cabin

217
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,030
in a forest north of Santa Fe.

218
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,009
And there were
scattered families around,

219
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,702
but mostly it was just us alone.

220
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,139
And I would get so bored
cooped up with my mom

221
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,432
and sister,
I would just beg them,

222
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,184
"Just let me play outside."

223
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,769
But my mom was scared

224
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,837
and she wouldn't let me
go outside alone.

225
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,607
But one day, I just fucking did,

226
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,442
and I had a gun,
so who's gonna fuck with me?

227
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,444
Now, you already know
how this story ends

228
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:50,448
because I don't live in a cabin
north of Santa Fe anymore,

229
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,474
and I don't have a mom
or sister anymore.

230
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,870
But since everyone's
past is fucked

231
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,038
and we've all heard
everyone's fucked stories,

232
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,457
how do you think this one goes?

00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,278

And then?

00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,132
Uh, you got home.

236
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,301
They were dead, he was gone.

237
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,493
Almost.
He was still there.

238
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,473
I heard them screaming
and I ran back with my gun out

239
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,559
but I was too slow
because I was fucking eight.

240
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,644
And when he heard me,
he turned around,

241
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,128
and he looked really startled.

242
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,983
And when I shot him,
he looked more...

243
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,484
startled.

244
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,486

245
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,488

- How did you get to Jackson?
- It doesn't matter.

247
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,351
This is what matters.

Whatever reason Joel gave
those people to do what they did,

249
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,273
he didn't deserve that.

250
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,486
And I think,
what if I hadn't snuck out?

251
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,757
What if my mom and sister

252
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,699
were beaten to death
in front of me?

253
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,953
What if that motherfucker
made me watch as he did it?

254
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,848
Would it make a difference
if my family

255
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,290
had hurt his people first?

00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,168

has to be a last resort, okay?
