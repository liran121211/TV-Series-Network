But if that day should come...

716
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:42,065
if you should ever
have one of your own...

717
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:49,739
well, then...

718
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,870
I hope you do
a little better than me.

719
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:58,081
[Ellie sniffling]

720
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,088
[sighs deeply]

721
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,890
I don't think I can
forgive you for this.

722
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,277
But I would like to try.

723
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,825
[♪ gentle music playing]

724
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:42,083
[rain falling]

725
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,838
[thunder rumbling]

726
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,868
[thunder crashing]

727
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,895
[♪ soft music playing]

728
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,278
[♪ music swells]

729
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:17,076
[♪ gentle music playing]

730
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:26,062
[♪ music fades out]
