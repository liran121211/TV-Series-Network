1
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,011
Swear to me that everything you said
about the Fireflies is true.

2
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,350
I swear.

3
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,616
Okay.

4
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,066
Why would he do this?

5
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,068
I heard rumors.

6
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,362
It was some kid he took
that was supposedly--

7
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,240
- That wasn't true.
- Supposedly what?

8
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,368
Something not true.

9
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,828
Because it isn't possible.

10
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,123
No. Probably not.

11
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,916
And even if it were,
it doesn't fucking matter anyway.

12
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,418
- Not without--
- Enough.

13
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,924
You want to worry about something,
worry about us.

14
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:19,179
So, what do we do?
Do we look for other Fireflies?

15
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,723
Where?

16
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,644
This place was the Fireflies.

17
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,898
Ed has a brother
who runs an outfit in Seattle.

18
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:33,318
A guy named Isaac.
Supposedly, he'd take us all in.

19
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,196
Not until we find Joel.

20
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:43,036
We're finding him. Yes, we are.

21
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,581
Yes, we are.

22
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,668
Alright, let's talk about how.

23
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,128
Because here's what we got.

24
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,589
He's a smuggler.
His name's Joel or Joe.

25
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,007
There's some confusion about that--

26
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,635
Fifties, graying, beard, six foot tall,
scar on his right temple.

27
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,429
Oh, yeah.
They say he's handsome.

28
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,513
I forgot.

29
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,099
With a three-day jump on us.
We should have gone right after him.

30
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,143
He drove away, Abby.
In our only working vehicle.

31
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,645
And we were trying to save the wounded.

32
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,400
But we didn't save anyone, did we?

33
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,279
- It's not fucking fair.
- No.

34
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,907
None of this is fucking fair.

35
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,409
Abby.

36
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,497
Maybe,

37
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,293
maybe the Seattle crew has resources.

38
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,756
They could help us get some sort of lead.

39
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,636
You'll help me find him.

40
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,015
Yes. We'll help you find him.

41
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,853
Then, we'll help you kill him.

42
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,028
Slowly.

43
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,072
What?

44
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,369
When we kill him,

45
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,749
we kill him slowly.

46
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,791
Get up.

47
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,882
Okay. Okay.

48
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,176
Ellie!

49
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,101
Boom, motherfucker.

50
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,019
First of all, "okay" means stop.

51
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,813
Sorry, I was in the moment.

52
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,731
Second, you can't
"Boom, motherfucker" people

53
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,191
who land the first hit on you.

54
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,651
Square in the face, by the way.

55
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,404
Well, I can obviously take a punch,
so who cares?

56
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,614
- Fuckin' hard, by the way.
- I pulled it.

57
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,867
- You pulled it?
- Yeah, he pulled it.

58
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,577
- Why?
- 'Cause I told him to.

59
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,163
- Why?
- Otherwise, he would have knocked you out.

60
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,583
And I don't want to have
to explain that to Joel.

61
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,920
Don't do that again.

62
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,505
Okay.

63
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,887
I should've closed in faster on that one,
but the rest was good.

64
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,347
The rest was good.

65
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,518
Are you going to the thing tonight?

66
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,063
Don't we have to?
'Cause community and shit?

67
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,108
You're part of the community now?

68
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,155
Seriously, though, if you are,
we could use an extra pair of hands

69
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,824
breaking down firewood for the cookout.

70
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,120
Don't pull punches.

71
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,873
Oh.

72
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,292
Well, that's fucked.

73
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,277
Hey.

74
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,279
Hey, kiddo.

75
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,656
Somethin' go wrong out there?

76
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,868
Well, the main lines are clay,
all cracked to shit and full of roots.

77
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:42,748
We're not sure what we're supposed to do,
and our foreman isn't foreman-ing.

78
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,003
Yeah, sorry.
I'll be out there in a minute.

79
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,673
- Whatcha doin'?
- Fixing these breakers.

80
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,468
They were gonna chuck the whole panel
but all they need is new springs.

81
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,057
Teach me?

82
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:04,812
Okay.

83
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,024
Well...

84
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,277
First thing first,
before you mess with circuits,

85
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,695
you gotta check if the wires are live.

86
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,280
So, how do you do that?

87
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,532
I...

88
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,492
lick them?

89
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,372
Voltage tester.

90
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,461
Now, this right here
is the part that matters.

91
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,087
Bimetallic strip.

92
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,965
Too much current runs through,
heats up the strip,

93
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,843
it bends, releases the lever?

94
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,552
Circuit breaks.

95
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,054
Otherwise,
the wires get hotter and hotter,

96
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,222
lights the inside of your walls on fire.

97
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,558
There goes your house.

98
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,311
- Can I ask a question?
- Shoot.

99
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,773
Why is she angry at you?

100
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,863
- She said she was angry?
- No, but...

101
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,037
You're her best friend,
reckon she would have told you.

102
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,498
Nope.

103
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,130
Well, I figure it's normal.

104
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:18,468
Her bein' 19 and me bein' her, what I am.

105
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,930
No one likes their parents at that age.
I never got there with my own kid,

106
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,642
so we're both just figuring it out
for the first time, is all.

107
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,645
We'll get through it.

108
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,690
Yeah, that makes sense.

109
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,276
- So, the springs hold the levers back--
- The thing is, I try.

110
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,530
I know I'm a hard-ass
and maybe overprotective,

111
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,865
and she's

112
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,369
her, but...

113
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,998
I mean, what did I do?

114
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,043
I don't know.

115
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,214
Yeah, well.

116
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,303
I can't hold myself responsible
for another person's emotional state.

117
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,475
Are you in fucking therapy?

118
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,144
Holy shit, you're seeing Gail?

119
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,147
I'm not in therapy. Jesus, go,

120
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,190
go fix the main line.

121
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,859
Saw out the cracked parts,

122
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,111
pull the roots and we'll fill in the gaps
with some ABS.

123
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,488
Go on.

124
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,578
It'll be okay.

125
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:32,918
Dina.

126
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,759
Don't tell anyone I'm in therapy.

127
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,074
Oh, shit.

128
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,951
This scope is sick.

129
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,788
It ain't the scope, it's the shooter.

130
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,332
- You're gettin' good.
- Who's next?

131
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,667
Let's see.

132
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,838
Ah, okay.
There's a cluster of 'em up by the road.

133
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,758
- One's broken away, you see him?
- See him.

134
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,594
Alright, you wanna take your time
with this one.

135
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,763
It's further away, so more drop.

136
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,641
He's going uphill,
so you gotta compensate.

137
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,935
Head shot?

138
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,437
Always.

139
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,032
- Ah, fuck.
- Nah.

140
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,951
It's alright, you got him anyway.

141
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,120
I guess. A lot of them out there.

142
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,041
Yeah, I noticed.
Probably followin' down Route 89.

143
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,337
Maybe comin' outta Alpine.

144
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,048
We should head back.
I wanna get a patrol out there.

145
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,218
Cool, I'll do that run.

146
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:09,055
Actually,
I'm takin' you off patrols for a bit.

147
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,348
Puttin' you on gate watch.

148
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,226
Gate watch? What? Why?

149
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,186
'Cause it's an important job.

150
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,565
It's standing on a fucking fence.

151
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,859
He's concerned about you.

152
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,861
Unfucking real.

153
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,572
Well, you know, last run,
you were a bit reckless.

154
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,907
It was two runners and a Clicker
who barely had teeth.

155
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,784
I handled it. Isn't that the job?

156
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,661
You wandered off on your own, Ellie.

157
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,788
- We have rules for reasons.
- Oh, please, Dina does this shit

158
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,915
all the time, no one's putting her
on the fucking fence.

159
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,794
Tommy, I'm an adult.
He can't tell me what I can and can't do.

160
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,589
Yeah, well, he can tell me.

161
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,758
Look, I've been dealin' with him
my whole life.

162
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,261
Sometimes, easier to just go along.

163
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,555
I don't care if it's easier.
It's not fair.

164
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,015
And by the way, you know I'm the one

165
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,975
we should be least worried about
when it comes to infected.

166
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,020
Hey, no. You swore.
We don't talk about that.

167
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,897
I got bit on my arm.

168
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,650
Ellie, we don't talk about that.

169
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,986
- I got bit, everybody!
- Hey!

170
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,196
- I got bit!
- Hey! Hey, hey!

171
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,741
I'm immune!

172
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,535
Hey! Jesus.

173
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,412
Goddammit.

174
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:18,166
I swear, you and my brother?
Same goddamn fuckin' person.

175
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,253
Well, if we're the same person,
you know you're not winning this.

176
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,841
Put me on the patrol.

177
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,139
Alpine run leaves at 1300.

178
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,812
Now, you follow the rules.

179
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,148
You obey your captain.

180
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,399
No questions, no exceptions.

181
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,736
Well, that depends. Who's the captain?

182
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,572
- Ellie.
- Okay, fine. Whatever.

183
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,158
I'll do it by the book.

184
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,167
Easy girl. Come on.

185
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,548
Open it up!

186
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,479
These three will be done
by next day or so.

187
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,398
Then another day to hook up sewage.

188
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,901
Now, y'all wanted the library
and the school restored by spring.

189
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,528
But they both need new roofs.

190
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,114
With the manpower that we have,
I don't see any of this

191
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,658
gettin' done until summer.

192
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,370
This window isn't keepin'
the cold out anymore.

193
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,124
Yeah, yeah. Caulk.
It's high up on my list.

194
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,959
We've been using a ton of it
to restore the new--

195
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,421
- We need to build faster.
- Faster?

196
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,339
Sure. How much faster?

197
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,719
See, we got this dial
called the Constructo meter.

198
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,637
- Joel.
- The more you turn it, the faster we go.

199
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,431
We're running out of space
to put these people.

200
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,515
Yeah, I noticed.

201
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,935
Maybe your council
would stop lettin' so many of 'em in.

202
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,562
It's our council.

203
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,522
And those people are fleeing
collapsed settlements.

204
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,649
They're fleeing infected.
We're supposed to leave them out there?

205
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,945
If our lifeboat is swamped,
yeah, we leave 'em out there.

206
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,621
If I could, I'd let 'em all in.

207
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,917
And I'm workin' every damn day and night
to make more space, you know that.

208
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:28,005
But you got to look after your own first,
or you're no good to anyone.

209
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,050
- Uncle Joel.
- Hey, buddy.

210
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,887
- What are those?
- Come here.

211
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,181
Okay, we're lookin' at maps.

212
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,768
See? This is where we live.

213
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,770
- And what's that?
- The fence.

214
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,438
- And what's inside?
- People!

215
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,565
- And what's outside?
- Monsters.

216
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,233
That's right. And how do we keep 'em out?

217
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,195
- We shoot them.
- What do you mean, "we"?

218
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,946
Are you shootin' monsters?

219
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,740
- No.
- Are you shootin' monsters?

220
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,033
- No.
- You are. You are.

221
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,493
- Hey.
- You're shootin' monsters!

222
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,577
Daddy!

223
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,621
There he is! Killer!

224
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,749
Yeah. I missed you, boy.

225
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,209
Hey.

226
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,588
- What y'all up to?
- Well, your wife wants me to build faster.

227
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,756
Did you tell her about the big dial?

228
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,134
Yeah, he told me. Come here, baby.

229
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,553
Ah! You're getting so big.

230
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,850
- You huntin' or...?
- Infected.

231
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,686
What? By yourself?

232
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,605
Yeah.

233
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,484
I gotta go.

234
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,488
You keep gettin' those monsters, Benji.

235
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,033
Oh, you got me.

236
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,536
You got me.

237
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,329
Joel.

238
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,457
You were a refugee too.

239
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,185
It's open.

240
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,567
I'll be right there.

241
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,132
Do you want anything to drink?

242
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,383
What do you have?

243
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,136
Whiskey. Herbal tea.

244
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,098
But the tea's mostly
thistles and dirt, so.

245
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,988
What's the occasion?

246
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,616
It's my birthday.

247
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,331
Well, you wanna start or what?

248
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,966
Shake and stems.
What am I, in high school?

249
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,052
It's winter, Gail.

250
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,346
That never stopped Eugene.

251
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,513
January, February,

252
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,892
the man would grow buds
the size of pinecones.

253
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,519
Sticky as glue.

254
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,234
Payment accepted.

255
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,995
Didn't know psychiatrists were allowed
to drink in these things.

256
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,038
Psychotherapist.

257
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,916
Psychiatrists are the pill ones.

258
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,210
And, no, we're not allowed
to drink in these things.

259
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,671
But I woke up this morning feeling sad.

260
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:00,968
It's my first birthday
without my husband in 41 years.

261
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,020
Tick, tick, tick.

262
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,611
Well, I tried what you said. I backed off.

263
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,196
I stopped puttin' pressure on her.

264
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,365
Don't even make her sit down with me
for dinner anymore.

265
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,742
And what do I get for it? Nothin'.

266
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,786
She comes home,
shuts herself in the damn garage,

267
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,247
which I should never have
allowed her to move into.

268
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,834
And that's it. Not so much as a hello.

269
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,377
I see her around town.

270
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,171
Gives me a nod like I'm a stranger
or some asshole.

271
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,507
Even Dina asked me today,
"What's wrong with her?"

272
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,010
I mean, everyone can tell.

273
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,886
Now, that one.

274
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,390
That one treats me like a human being.

275
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,767
She talks to me, says "Hello,"

276
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,728
gives me a smile, looks up to me,

277
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,022
makes me feel like I'm a good guy,
which I am.

278
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,565
See, Dina understands me.

279
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,609
Like she's my kid or somethin'.

280
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,405
But she's not.

281
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,533
Neither is Ellie.

282
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:09,870
Tell you what.

283
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,914
Let's try something different.

284
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,169
- Like what?
- Like not pretending

285
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,714
you have the most boring
problem in the world.

286
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,090
"Oh, a 19-year-old daughter.

287
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:26,385
"She's acting toward me like
every 19-year-old daughter

288
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,181
has ever acted toward their dad, ever."

289
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,390
What is this, our fifth session?

290
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:35,144
Are you just gonna keep
grouching on like this every time?

291
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,731
Aren't you supposed to be
validating me or somethin'?

292
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,234
Oh, yeah, actually, I am.

293
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,821
But I'm not gonna do it anymore
because you're lying to me,

294
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,615
and it's exhausting.

295
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,451
Yes, you are, Joel. Yes, you are.

296
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:54,080
I've done this long enough to know
when somebody is leaving something out.

297
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,958
And you are definitely
leaving something out.

298
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,794
And you want me to validate that?

299
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,295
No.

300
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,173
In fact, fuck, no.

301
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,554
- That's not your first one of the day.
- Oh, no, it isn't.

302
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,182
And before, when I said I was sad,
that wasn't true either.

303
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,101
I'll just come back another day.

304
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,728
Should I say it out loud?

305
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,108
Yeah, I should.

306
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,070
You can't heal something
unless you're brave enough

307
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,656
to say it out loud.

308
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,578
I'm scared though.

309
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,957
I'm scared to say it.

310
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,751
Which is why I have to.

311
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,591
You shot and killed my husband.

312
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,095
You killed Eugene.

313
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,222
And I resent you for it.

314
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,225
No. Maybe a little more than that.

315
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,437
I hate you for it.

316
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,814
I hate you for it.

317
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,108
And, yes, I know you had no choice.

318
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,987
I know that. I know I should forgive you.

319
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,323
Well, I've tried, and I can't

320
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:14,035
because of how you did it.

321
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:20,542
And looking at your face
sitting in our home,

322
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,005
makes me so fucking angry.

323
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,850
There it is. I've said it.

324
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,018
I'm ashamed.

325
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,314
But it's in the air
and I can't take it back.

326
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,905
And now, maybe there's a chance
I can make things right with you.

327
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,910
Your turn.

328
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,581
Say the thing you're afraid to say.

329
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,085
I can help you.

330
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,215
Say it out loud, no matter what it is.
No matter how bad.

331
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,800
I promise, I will help.

332
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,808
Did you do something to her?

333
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,858
Did you hurt her?

334
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,860
No. No.

335
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,196
Then, what?

336
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,074
What did you do?

337
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,639
I saved her.

338
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,000
Coming.

339
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,087
Hi.

340
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,005
Came to pick you up.

341
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,090
Oh, you're on this run?

342
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,968
Give me a second.

343
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,930
Take as much time as you need.
Two minutes.

344
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,518
I heard you were getting stuck
on the fence today.

345
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,771
How'd you get out of that?

346
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,024
- Tommy.
- Tommy.

347
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,610
Where'd you get the holster?

348
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:38,073
Dominique. Traded some old boots for it.

349
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,911
Should've kept the boots.

350
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,246
Here, let me help.

351
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,581
- I can do it.
- It's okay.

352
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,167
I got it. There we go.

353
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,421
Just like that. Hold on.
Let me get this part here.

354
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,884
Yep. 'Cause now-- There we go.

355
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,263
- Better?
- Yeah, better.

356
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,140
Look at you with all that hardware.

357
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,726
You're like Curtis and Viper.

358
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,520
You know those movies Joel likes?

359
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,105
Yeah, I know.

360
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,564
I was actually gonna maybe watch them

361
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,693
tomorrow night with him,
if you wanna join.

362
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,028
Patrol?

363
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,323
Yeah. Yeah, patrol.

364
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,827
- Why, thank you.
- You're welcome.

365
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,954
Yeah.

366
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,463
Hey, Shimmer.

367
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,299
Hi, girl.

368
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,009
Ellie.

369
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,565
There we go.

370
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:59,486
Okay, we're five minutes behind
because of one or two of you,

371
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,905
so I'll make it short.

372
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,365
You're doing the Alpine run.

373
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,368
I know a couple of you
are new to this trail, so listen up.

374
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,164
You're taking Route 191 down to Hoback.

375
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,040
- Yes, Dina.
- Hi.

376
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:15,294
Should we stick to the road,
scan the countryside, hit our checkpoints,

377
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,756
and sign the log books?

378
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,966
You know what? That sounds great.

379
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,761
But while you're doing all that,
we've got reports of strays.

380
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,722
So, be careful when you get into the town.

381
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,767
Now, I see Ellie over here
looking like Curtis and Viper.

382
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,894
- The fuck?
- So, let me remind you,

383
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,354
this is just a recon patrol.

384
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,857
If you see one or two runners,
that's fine, clear 'em out.

385
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,193
Anything more, anything worse,

386
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,612
you come on back and we send out a squad.
Understood?

387
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,698
You know you're only, like,
four years older than us, right?

388
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,576
Just say, "Understood."

389
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,663
- Understood.
- Thank you.

390
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:55,752
Your patrol leader is Kat,
so you will follow her orders.

391
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,713
When you're back,
today's all-clear sign is yellow.

392
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,050
Yellow, good. Green, bad.

393
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:08,014
Jokes aside, can you take things
a little more seriously?

394
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,310
The others look up to you two.

395
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,814
For some fuckin' reason.

396
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,108
Okay, Alpine run, moving out!

397
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,570
Alpine run! Moving out, let's go!

398
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,828
So, you going tonight?

399
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,414
Yes, I'm going.

400
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,499
Taking anyone?

401
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,254
- No.
- Why not?

402
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,423
- Kat's available.
- Why would I ask Kat?

403
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,510
Because she's the other one.

404
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,262
- Oh, my God.
- What?

405
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,973
You used to with her.

406
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,391
And she definitely left her mark.

407
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,019
Right, yes, thank you.

408
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,896
But no.

409
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,694
You're into someone else.

410
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,449
Tell you what. You can go with me.

411
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,117
We can get baked.

412
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,828
We can dance to the smooth tunes of--
what are they called?

413
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,248
Britney and the Jug Boys. It'll be fun!

414
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,207
We'll count down to the New Year together.

415
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,209
BFFs, 2029.

416
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,337
- Aren't you and Jesse?
- No.

417
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,505
Broke up.

418
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,799
Yes, again.

419
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,635
For now.

420
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,596
What is it with you two?

421
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,433
I don't know.

422
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,621
Let's go.

423
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,791
- Okay. We're on.
- Wait.

424
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,668
We should go back and report it.

425
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,795
We're recon, Kat. Let's fuckin' recon.

426
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,005
Wait, guys!

427
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,717
Hey, come on. Guys!

428
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,666
How many infected does it take
to bring down a bear?

429
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,919
Check out the van.

430
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,130
So, they've been sheltering in the market.

431
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,799
Yeah, it looks like at least one of them
made it back in.

432
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,176
Maybe needed a nap
after chomping that poor thing.

433
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,470
Yeah.

434
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,056
Hey,

435
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,350
what do you call a grizzly's ribs?

436
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,103
Bear-b-cue.

437
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,649
Did you just make that up?

438
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,401
- Yeah.
- Bear-b-cue?

439
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,611
- Yeah.
- Seriously?

440
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,411
So, you think Hungry Boy
is still alive in there?

441
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,038
Fuckin' hope so.

442
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,123
Good.

443
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,250
Hi. Oh, hi there.

444
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,586
- Here comes fun.
- Hi.

445
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,713
Oh, my God.

446
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:11,632
Happy?

447
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,431
Hey, can we go back now, please?

448
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,224
Yeah, we will. Promise.

449
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:25,228
We're just gonna listen quick,
see if any are in there,

450
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,897
which is definitely recon.

451
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,398
Hey, you know,
maybe there's a regular person

452
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,275
who's trapped and needs help.

453
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,527
Yeah, what if there's a family in there?

454
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,614
What if there's a toddler? Or a baby?

455
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,575
There's no babies in there.

456
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,911
Hey, come on.

457
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,080
Rules!

458
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,832
Fine.

459
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,085
If you hear anything, you come right back.

460
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,462
Okay.

461
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,132
You just gonna let 'em go in?

462
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,676
I'll give 'em five minutes.

463
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,685
Two on one.

464
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,909
Okay, so one on one.
We've done that before.

465
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,792
If you'd rather let the men handle it.

466
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,045
Two.

467
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,214
The bottle.

468
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,275
Fuck yeah.

469
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,445
Did you get bit?
Do I have to shoot you in the face?

470
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,280
- Not today.
- Okay.

471
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,699
Nice.

472
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,495
Oh, my God, before we leave,
you gotta check out the employee--

473
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,415
Ellie!

474
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,585
Ellie! Ellie!

475
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,088
Ellie, are you okay?

476
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,217
I'm good.

477
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:12,265
Nothing's broken, I don't think.

478
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,642
Oh, shit.

479
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,644
Are you alone?

480
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,987
I don't hear anything.

481
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,865
I think we're good.

482
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,380
Alright, let's figure out
how to get you out.

483
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:48,927
I don't see a way out.

484
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,388
- A bunch of padlocked doors.
- Okay.

485
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:56,059
It's too far for me to drop down,
so I can find a stairway or something

486
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,894
and figure out a path back up here.

487
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,896
- Just stay put.
- Yeah.

488
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,190
Ellie?

489
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,567
Stay put.

490
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,612
- Yeah.
- Alright.

491
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,041
Run at me, fucker!

492
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,298
Run at me!

493
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,408
Fuck.

494
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,830
Ellie, are you okay?! Ellie, it's me!

495
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,374
Over here!

496
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,963
Oh, shit. You okay?

497
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:17,923
Yeah.

498
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,594
That was it?

499
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,515
- Just her?
- Just her.

500
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,981
<i>So, you're saying it was, what?</i>

501
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,190
Smart?

502
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,109
I'm not saying
it could do math or anything,

503
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,485
but it didn't run at me.

504
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:43,156
It did what we do--
took cover, planned, waited,

505
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,324
lured me in.

506
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,493
Stalking.

507
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,496
And you saw this?

508
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,332
It was exactly like Ellie says.

509
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:57,170
And how exactly does you two runnin' into
an uncleared building

510
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,548
qualify as following the rules
and obeying your captain?

511
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,675
Well, it wasn't like
this is our first time.

512
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,719
We've killed a lot of infected before.

513
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,887
And you're telling me, what,

514
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,263
if it were you and Joel,
you wouldn't have gone in?

515
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,557
- Well, that ain't the same.
- Why?

516
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,185
- 'Cause it's different.
- How?

517
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:19,777
Alright. Apologize to Kat
and log your report with Jesse. Go.

518
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,913
Do we believe them?

519
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:35,625
Dina was lying. She didn't see anything.
But I believe Ellie.

520
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,836
Maybe this smart one was a one-off.

521
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:39,796
Maybe.

522
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,881
But what about the other six
that brought down the grizzly?

523
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,759
Yeah, well, six ain't good,
but it's not exactly a horde.

524
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,261
Not yet.

525
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,931
I don't know, just lately,
I've had a feeling.

526
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,433
A feeling?

527
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:56,605
"Reality is nothing
but a collective hunch."

528
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,860
Lily Tomlin.

529
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,280
Four hours till New Year's.

530
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,616
We adjourned?

531
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:09,827
Adjourned.

532
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,250
Come in.

533
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,422
Ellie.

534
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,636
- Better?
- Nope.

535
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:53,680
Okay.

536
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,144
Just come to see if you were going
to that thing tonight.

537
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,396
Be good to show your face.

538
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,398
I don't know. Yeah, maybe.

539
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,776
I don't know.

540
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,450
You been playin' much?

541
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,286
Enough, yeah.

542
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,842
Strings are shot.

543
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,344
- Well--
- I'll put some new ones on for ya.

544
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:34,679
Oh, you don't have to do that, I--

545
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,306
I can get it back tomorrow.

546
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:22,769
Oh, sorry!

547
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,709
I hate these things.

548
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:51,131
Tell me about it.
Had to get half-drunk just to show up.

549
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,509
She's putting on quite the show.

550
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,595
Happy New Year!

551
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:07,481
You guys will be back
together in two weeks, tops.

552
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,233
Not gonna happen.

553
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,737
- Why?
- Ellie! Hey!

554
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,280
What took you so long?

555
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,699
Okay, this next one is a little slower.

556
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,035
- It's one of our favorites.
- Come on! Let's go!

557
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,621
Hey, don't forget, you got early patrol,
so get some rest.

558
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,332
Sir, yes, sir.

559
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,933
Okay, I have a very serious
question for you.

560
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,353
How bad do I smell?

561
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:54,318
Like a hot pile of garbage.

562
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,279
Oh, okay.

563
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,782
Yeah.

564
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,536
Gross.

565
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,663
You're so drunk.

566
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,416
I'm high. Smoked a lot.

567
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:41,283
Every guy in this room
is staring at you right now.

568
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:49,833
Maybe they're staring at you.

569
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,004
They're not.

570
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,382
Maybe

571
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:00,427
they're jealous of you.

572
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,015
No reason to be.

573
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,350
I'm not a threat.

574
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:13,899
Oh, Ellie.

575
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:19,196
I think they should be terrified of you.

576
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:45,931
Hey.

577
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,768
It's a family event.

578
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,021
Sorry.

579
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,735
Sorry!

580
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,240
You're in a church.

581
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,033
- Dykes.
- The fuck did you just say?

582
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,619
Ellie, no. Ellie.

583
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,037
Get the hell outta here.

584
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,539
Jesus!

585
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,501
Seth, let's...

586
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:19,464
Let's take a walk. Come on. Let's go.

587
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,842
Are you okay?

588
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,679
What is wrong with you?

589
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,978
I don't need your fucking help.

590
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,485
Right.

591
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,599
There ya go!

592
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,144
Cheers!

593
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,064
Happy fucking New Year!

594
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,113
- Same thing.
- I know.

595
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,490
We started at the party too, man.

596
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,825
I know.

597
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,996
Oh, my God. Wait up!

598
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,415
Come on, let's go.
