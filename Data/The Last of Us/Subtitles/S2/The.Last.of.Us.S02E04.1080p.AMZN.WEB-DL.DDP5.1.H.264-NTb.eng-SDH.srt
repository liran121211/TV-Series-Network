You, cut 'em down.

Yep.

- You said it was a burn.
- Most of it is.

It's a little thing,
but when you start

00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,503
to hide little things,
they become big things.

592
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,862
You don't say.

593
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,748
Why now?

594
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,883
I thought you were gone.

595
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,322
And then all of a sudden,

596
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,098
this future I was imagining...

597
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,518
wasn't gonna happen.

00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,362
I don't even know
if you want that.

600
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,867

How?
I was hiding it really well.

604
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,276
No, you kind of fucking weren't.

605
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,403
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

606
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:47,572
I wanted to.

607
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:48,722
Yeah?

608
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,353
When I was little...

609
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,751
I told my mother I liked boys
and I liked girls.

610
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:03,046
And she said,
"No, you like boys."

611
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,112
[Ellie] Hm.

612
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,615
And it just...

613
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:12,496
I got stuck.

614

Even after she died, it...

615
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,004
I tried to make things
work with Jesse

616
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,758
because I like him.
I do, I think he's a really good guy.

617
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,512
But he wasn't the one.

618
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,100
Still kept trying anyway.

619
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:38,522
Couldn't let myself just...
be.

620
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,861
You were scared.

621
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,174
Not everyone's as brave as you.

622
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,927
I'm not brave.
I'm just obvious.

How do you know
for sure that you're...

629
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,960
Oh!
I started wondering

630
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,504
after we saw the bodies
in the forest,

631
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:29,007
because I've seen fucked-up shit before
without barfing.

632
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:32,010
And I knew morning sickness
was a thing,

633
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,554
and I was late, which I--
I've never been regular,

634
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,806
but I was very late.

635
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,559
And then, I found
a pregnancy test

636
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,645
at the pharmacy,
and I peed on it.

637
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,981
- You pee on it?
- That's how it works.

piss on stuff.

- And here.

644
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,270
