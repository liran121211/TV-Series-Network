00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,136
[voice]
He's dead.

6
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,267
Who?

7
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,999
[breathing shakily]

8
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,525
I don't know you.

9
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,338
[clicks tongue]
Don't go in there.

10
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,841
- Stop it.
- I am telling you, go back.

11
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,051
No.

12
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,409
[sighs]

13
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,664
His brains are on the floor.

15
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,130

- Hey.
- Hey.

21
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,099
Fuck.

22
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,227
[shivering]

23
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,666
You been out?

24
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,168
Yeah, thought about
setting up a watch,

25
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,611
in case one of those patrols
gets too close.

26
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,424
Made it about an hour.
[chuckles]

27
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,592
We'll do shifts.

28
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,302
I'll get you something
to warm up.

29
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,077
- Mm-hmm.
- Fuck.

30
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,932
It did not look like that
in the dark.

31
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,268
Shit. Hey, you two.
Hey. Come on.

32
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,145
- [groaning]
- Get up, get up, get up.

33
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,771
- Let me see.
- Well, it's alright.

34
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,106
Now that we know
what we're dealing with,

35
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,442
we can come up with a plan.

36
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,176
- Right?
- Definitely.

37
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,988
- [Mel] Fuck.
- [Nora] Oh, shit.

38
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,616
Wha-- It's-- it's a city, Abs.

39
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,492
I thought it would be like
a tent colony or something.

40
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,952
Well, we knew they had lights.

41
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,537
Yeah, I thought they were
from little generators

42
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,955
- like we use at the FOB.
- [Manny] Nope.

43
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,707
They got full
fuckin' power lines.

44
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,334
[Nora]
Oh, well, isn't that great?

45
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,794
[Owen]
Power lines aren't a problem.

46
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,171
Here are the problems.

47
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,465
They've got four main gates,
no other ins or outs.

48
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,508
Guard towers flanking each exit.

49
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,386
Mounted patrols, all heavily armed,
overlapping routes.

50
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,846
These guys are trained.

51
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,414
[Owen] Yeah, they've got
some vets down there, for sure.

52
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,334
But, okay.

53
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,313
Let's just say
we get past the gates,

54
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,315
the guards, the patrols--

55
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,882
[Manny]
Ah, they also got dogs.

56
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,469
'Kay. [chuckles]
And the dogs.

57
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,098
We still don't know
where Joel is in there.

58
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,662
Okay, how about this?

59
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,998
We ambush a patrol.
We tie 'em up.

60
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,000
- Make 'em tell us where Joel is.
- [Owen] Make them?

61
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,710
Yeah, we said that we weren't
gonna hurt anyone else.

62
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,671
- Just Joel. I'm not gonna--
- Mel, fuck. Relax.

63
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,840
I'm not saying we would.
I'm saying we bluff.

64
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,093
Scare 'em, you know?

65
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,012
And if they don't talk,
then what?

66
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,330
Yeah, it's not like
we could let 'em go.

67
00:04:55,628 --> 00:05:00,734
I do have the beginnings
of an idea for a plan, maybe.

68
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,028
Just need some time.
I have to let it crystallize.

69
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,387
But you're onto something?

70
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,848
I'm onto something.

71
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,935
Okay. Then let's buy you
some time, then.

72
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,938
I'll take the next watch.

73
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,898
Where's the spot?

74
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,045
Up the hill.
A little outcropping.

75
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,463
You'll know it when you see it.

76
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,031
Okay.

77
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,200
Better be a good fuckin' plan.

78
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,916
[♪ tense music playing]

00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,880
[shivering]
Oh, fuck.

81
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,300
Fuckin' hour out here?

84
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,034
You don't actually
have a plan, do you?

85
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,661
No, I do.

86
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:16,167
The plan is to
convince her to go back.

87
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,147
'Cause if we don't,
the only people

88
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,839
getting killed out here are us.

95
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,965
Wow, you look like shit.

96
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,634
Dude, what do you want?

97
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,803
I want you to fulfill
your obligation

98
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,805
to the community
of Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

99
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,807
- Mm-hmm?
- 8:00 a.m. patrol.

100
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,350
[groaning]
It's eight?

101
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,143
No, it's-- 7:30.
But you're riding with me

102
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,353
and I like to be on time.

103
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,254
Okay, gimme a minute,
I'll get changed.

104
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,473
I heard you had quite
the night after I left.

105
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,820
Oh. Yeah.

106
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,822
Yeah, uh, she kissed me.

107
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,323
It was just Dina being Dina.

108
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,741
She was high,
she won't even remember it--

109
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,827
Uh, I was talking about
some fight

110
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,746
you had with Seth and Joel.

111
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,896
You kissed her?

112
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,834
- No.
- Wow, Ellie, come on.

113
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,252
We-- we've been
broken up one week,

114
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,711
- and you made a move on her?
- I-- I didn't.

115
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,921
- I didn't make--
- Seriously?

116
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,006
Dina-- you--
It didn't mean anything.

117
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,550
She was probably just trying
to make you jealous.

118
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,009
It didn't mean anything.
It didn't.

119
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,678
- I-- I wouldn't do that.
- I'm screwing with you, man.

120
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,846
I already know.
I don't care.

121
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,788
Come on, get dressed.
We gotta go.

122
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,040
You're the worst.

123
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,936
It's kind of fucked up
you did that, though.

124
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,003
- [scoffs]
- [slams door]

125
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,232
[Ellie]
What's everyone doing?

126
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,859
[Jesse]
Council put the town on alert.

127
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,445
Last night, Kylie and Max
found a pile of dead infected

128
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,363
near Seven Cabins.

129
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,866
- Frozen stiff.
- Okay?

130
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,243
They didn't think anything of it
until 30 live ones

131
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,037
broke through
from underneath the corpses.

132
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,623
They're using their own dead
like insulation.

133
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,917
Thirty? Fuck.
They okay?

134
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,752
Yeah, sprinted back
on their horses.

135
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,546
Sent a squad out
to clear the infected,

136
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,423
but now we're thinking
we don't know how many

137
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,300
are underneath the snow.

138
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,052
Could be 30 more.
Could be a thousand more.

139
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,430
A thousand?
Get the fuck outta here.

140
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,265
[chuckles softly]
Ah, yes.

141
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,809
Certainty masquerading
as knowledge.

142
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,978
- It's very Ellie of you.
- Suck my dick.

143
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,564
Also, somebody told
the council a ghost story

144
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,566
about the world's
smartest infected,

145
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,735
and now everybody's spooked
out of their minds.

146
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,404
It wasn't a ghost story.
You know, no offense, man.

147
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,323
I'm gonna do my patrol
with Joel.

148
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,450
Um, yes, offense,
'cause that's the one person

149
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,076
you've been avoiding
like the plague.

150
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,912
Well, we're better now, okay?

151
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,622
As of when?
'Cause last night I did--

152
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,915
Yeah, I know
what happened last night.

153
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,315
Can you shut the fuck...

154
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,611
[sighs]

155
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,841
My shit with Joel
is complicated.

156
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,676
I know that.
From the outside,

157
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,428
it probably looks really bad.

158
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,930
It <i>has</i> been really bad.

159
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,540
But I'm still me,
he's still Joel, and we--

160
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,771
And nothing's ever gonna
change that, ever.

161
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,272
So, you can all
stop talking about us,

162
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,108
worrying about us,
and thinking about us, alright?

163
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,051
So, you two hashed it out?

164
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,137
Uh... Alright.

165
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,784
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna go on patrol with him

166
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,994
like fucking daddy-daughter day.

167
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,372
- Okay? Okay.
- He already went out.

168
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,624
What? With who?

169
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,876
Dina.
They left an hour ago.

170
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,378
For what it's worth,
he wanted to go with you,

171
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,838
but he said
we should let you sleep.

172
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,633
- Let's hit the restaurant.
- I'm not hungry.

173
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,468
Neither am I,
but Maria wants to talk to you.

174
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,703
And don't ask.
I don't know.

175
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,223
[Tommy] <i>Now, the most likely
outcome is none of this</i>

176
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,642
is necessary, okay?

177
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,352
You wanna remind me next week
how I made y'all

178
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,020
go through
all this crap for no reason?

179
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,523
- [townsperson] Ha. Yeah.
- Nothin' will make me happier.

180
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,732
But you know the drill.

181
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,902
Prepare for the worst,
hope for the best.

182
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,862
Now, half of y'all is hung over
and want me to shut up.

183
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,322
- [laughter]
- But, uh,

184
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,032
I'ma go through this anyway
'cause it's been a minute.

185
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:02,411
If you see flares,
if you hear bells,

186
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,662
stop what you're doin'.

187
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,938
You follow the plan.
What's the plan?

188
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,166
Vanessa, what's the plan?

189
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,377
We go to the forest?

190
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,753
- [laughter]
- To the forest?

191
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,839
Do not go
to the forest, sweetheart.

192
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,215
Be such a bad idea.

193
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,676
- [laughter]
- Now, young ones, old ones,

194
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,845
right quick into basements
and cellars.

195
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,180
You lock the doors,
you reinforce, shelter in place

196
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,682
'til we tell you it's safe
to come out.

197
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,267
Now, for the rest of us,
where do we go?

198
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,852
- [crowd] Up!
- Up, that's right.

199
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,937

What do we bring?

200
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,188
[crowd] Guns!

201
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,857
- You wanted to--
- That means everyone is carrying

203
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,735

Keep 'em on you.
Safeties, please.

205
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,363
Somebody shot themselves
in the leg last week.

206

- [laughter]
- [townsperson] Earl!

207
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,034
- Alright, don't be Earl.
- [laughter]

208
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,745
Now, bigger weapons,

209

For the rest of you,
if there's a breach...

210
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,960
God forbid,
stay off the main street.

211
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,212
Last place you wanna be,
trust me on that one.

212
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,048
Any questions?

213
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,592
Alright then.
Get with your group leaders.

214
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,218
Spread the word
to your neighbors.

- Go hug Daddy.

This is bullshit, right?
It's just a drill.

220

Yep, it's a drill.

221
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,441

Correct.

Seth, we have something to say?

226
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,081
Yeah.
Um, so last night,

227
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,333
I obviously had a few too many.

228
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,669

I shouldn't even thought it.
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,854

if you're going out there.
