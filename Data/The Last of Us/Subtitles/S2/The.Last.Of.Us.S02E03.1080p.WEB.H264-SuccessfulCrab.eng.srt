1
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,528
Give Sarah my love.

2
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,270
...multiple lacerations.

3
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,150
My daughter, she's five years old.

4
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,878
Hey. It's okay.

5
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,088
You're in the hospital.

6
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,218
Are you in pain?

7
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,386
We can give you something.

8
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,310
Ellie! Ellie!

9
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:53,942
Here.

10
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,694
It's okay.

11
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,340
And how would you rate your pain?
Scale of one to ten?

12
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,324
- Nothing. Zero.
- Zero.

13
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,993
Can't ask for much more than that.

14
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,372
Okay. One last PFT.

15
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,019
Look at that.

16
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,294
Yeah.

17
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:19,938
Alright.

18
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,130
Today's the day.

19
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,525
- So, can I just--
- Almost.

20
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,094
I just need you to see one more person,
then you're good to go.

21
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,558
Oh, for fuck's sake.

22
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,288
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

23
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,540
If you say it that fast,
it kind of implies you're not.

24
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,899
Okay, ask me again.

25
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,984
How are you doing, Ellie?

26
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,630
Give me a moment.

27
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,633
It's really complicated
'cause, you know, feelings.

28
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,051
Okay.

29
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,577
Oh, come on, man,
I've been stuck in here since...

30
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,102
Yeah, I miss him.
He meant a lot to me.

31
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,169
So, yeah. Upset and sad.

32
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,046
Of course.

33
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,942
But I was actually wondering
about New Year's Eve.

34
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,694
You two got into it at the dance.

35
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,512
Was that the last time you spoke to him?

36
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:13,850
Yeah.

37
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,247
When I got home, he was on the porch,

38
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,024
and I should've talked to him,
but I didn't.

39
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,046
- Do you regret that?
- Yeah, of course.

40
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:32,803
But your final moment with someone
doesn't define your whole time with them.

41
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,288
It shouldn't, but it often does.

42
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,668
In my last moment with Joel, he said he

43
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,920
wronged you.

44
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,047
Maybe bad.

45
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,429
What is it that he said that he did?

46
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,932
Well, that's the thing.
It didn't really make sense.

47
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,810
He said, "I saved her."

48
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,856
He saved me a lot of times.

49
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,818
Yeah, I would think so.
But that's not wronging someone.

50
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,279
That's weird.

51
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,948
No idea what he meant.

52
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,785
I don't feel wronged.

53
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,223
Man, I wish I could have
let him off the hook

54
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,541
for whatever it was he was talking about.

55
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:26,130
I guess I'll have to let myself
off the hook for that.

56
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,675
Well, you really are doing good.

57
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:36,450
Shit, if everyone were as healthy as you,
what would I do for weed and booze?

58
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,619
I wouldn't worry, Gail,
there's still a lot of fucked up people

59
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,078
- in this town.
- Yeah.

60
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,854
But not you, though.

61
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,510
Ellie?

62
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,557
Fuck.

63
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,731
Yeah, I'm coming.

64
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,456
I went to the hospital.

65
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,310
When'd they let you out?

66
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,003
- Thirty minutes ago.
- Nice.

67
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,714
They made me talk to Gail.

68
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,554
I never said--

69
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,450
I should have said thank you

70
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,392
for all those times you came to visit.

71
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,455
That's okay.
You would have done the same for me.

72
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,190
- Yeah, maybe not as often.
- Yeah, no, probably not.

73
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,652
I made you cookies.

74
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,672
- Just 'cause?
- No.

75
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,532
This is a peace offering.

76
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,869
Because I'm about to make you angry.

77
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,709
In the hospital,

78
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,548
when you asked me about that day,

79
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,385
I told you I didn't learn anything useful.

80
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,680
That wasn't true.

81
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,727
I know most of their names,
and I know where they're from.

82
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,707
Please, just listen.
The doctors told me not to upset you.

83
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,793
- I don't give a fuck.
- And I knew that if I told you

84
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,586
where they were,
you'd just start pulling your tubes out

85
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,463
and crawling on your hands
and knees to get there.

86
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,406
I don't give a fuck.

87
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,202
You cost us time. You let them get away.

88
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,683
First of all,

89
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,394
this town was wreckage
and funerals for weeks.

90
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,813
Nobody was gonna go after anyone.

91
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,274
And then it occurred to me,
if you wanna find someone,

92
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,018
and the only thing you know about them
is where they're gonna end up.

93
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,305
Maybe let them get there.

94
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,565
I loved him too, you know.

95
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,357
Okay, let's start with names.

96
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,629
The dark-haired guy was Manny.
The other guy was Owen.

97
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,464
The girl with the dark hair
and the bald one,

98
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,341
one of them's named Nora.
I'm not sure which.

99
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,699
The girl with the braid?

100
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:52,910
Abby.

101
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,828
Abby.

102
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,041
Where are they from?

103
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,669
I saw a patch on a backpack.

104
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,255
Yellow triangle, wolf's head,

105
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,485
and the letters W-L-F.

106
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:12,197
And then, I remembered a story Eugene
told me from back when he was a Firefly.

107
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,865
He said that there were
these small regional groups

108
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,325
in the West all trying to fight FEDRA,

109
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,328
and how stupid it was
that they didn't just join together.

110
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:22,231
One of those groups was
the Washington Liberation Front.

111
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,252
Out of Seattle.

112
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,338
W-L-F. Wolf.

113
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,571
Fucking morons.

114
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,134
- Did he say how small they were?
- No.

115
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,345
But seeing as how no one's
ever mentioned them since,

116
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,579
I'm guessing small enough
for us to handle.

117
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,017
Who else knows?

118
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,584
Just us.

119
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,172
I wasn't gonna tell anyone before you.

120
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,277
So, now what?

121
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:22,958
Well?

122
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,437
I gotta think about this.

123
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,731
Think about what?
Let's fucking get these guys.

124
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,816
Ellie, it ain't that simple.

125
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,425
The town is still recovering.

126
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,570
- So are you.
- We get where you're coming from--

127
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,281
No, we don't get where you're coming from.
I don't get where you're coming from.

128
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,991
If it had been you,
Joel would be halfway to Seattle

129
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,909
- before the sun came up.
- He'd be halfway to Seattle

130
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,310
to save my life.

131
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,913
But when we lost people, no.

132
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,041
It would just break him
like it was his fault.

133
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,500
I saw that time and time again.

134
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,318
And don't talk to me
like I didn't know him.

135
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,445
He was my brother.

136
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,704
Listen, I'm not sayin'
you shouldn't do this.

137
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,224
But if we're gonna put a posse together,

138
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,643
we gotta do it right,
which means taking it to Maria.

139
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,896
Yes, it's fuckin' necessary.

140
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,815
She's gonna want a council meeting,
open it up to the town.

141
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,050
Everyone who wants
to get heard gets heard.

142
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,677
But you'll back us, right?

143
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,805
Of course, I will.

144
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,351
Come here.

145
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,628
And you, you hold out
information on me again,

146
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,196
you got rendering detail for a month.

147
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,449
Alright.

148
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,496
Ellie.

149
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,918
We buried our dead
ten miles south of town.

150
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,295
If you want to visit him.

151
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,967
When we're on our way to Seattle.

152
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:52,900
Well?

153
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,672
"No one following.
All clear. Keep moving."

154
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,090
Good.

155
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,117
Once we get resettled,
I'll teach you to whistle.

156
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,539
Why can't you tell me where we're going?

157
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,708
'Cause we don't know yet.

158
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,770
I've told you the reason we're going.

159
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:16,858
I know, but why can't
she just keep us safe?

160
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,258
The Prophet?

161
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:23,448
She's been dead ten years, Constance.
I wouldn't count on her to help.

162
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,242
But Ezra said the Prophet is eternal.

163
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,061
Well, she is, in a way.

164
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,247
A prophet isn't magic.

165
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,834
They're just people that see
truths hidden from others

166
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,402
and share that truth,
no matter what the cost.

167
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,548
So it was with our Prophet.

168
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,175
So it was.

169
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,552
That's how we keep her spirit alive.

170
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:49,706
Follow her words, we obey her teachings,
but we keep ourselves safe.

171
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,671
Then, can I have a hammer?

172
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,342
Alright.

173
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,366
Tell me, you feel safer?

174
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,641
Yes.

175
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,018
Good.

176
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,664
Understand, what we're giving you now,

177
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,357
will keep you far, far safer
than a hammer.

178
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,361
Distance.

179
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,863
From home.

180
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,532
From war.

181
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,295
Take cover! Go!

182
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,730
Demons?

183
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,941
Wolves.

184
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,130
Alright.

185
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,114
Good, but rotate. More.

186
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,635
Now, the right side. Just the right side.

187
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,970
Come on, man, that side hurts more.

188
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,888
I noticed.

189
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,080
- Come on.
- Okay.

190
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,767
Harder.

191
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,102
Harder! Let's go!

192
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,461
Last five.

193
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,442
There it is, okay. Done for the day.

194
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,675
Okay.

195
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,362
So, what'd you think?

196
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,780
Well, for someone who sat on their ass

197
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,325
for three months,
I'm pleasantly surprised.

198
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,285
- Yeah?
- Push-ups?

199
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,412
Yeah, and crunches
when they weren't looking.

200
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,289
Yeah, that'll do it.

201
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,624
A few more weeks, and you'll be right back
to where you were before.

202
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,251
Nice.

203
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,128
Which is 80% of where you
should have been.

204
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,071
Whatever. Fuck you.

205
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,494
So, I heard you're on the council now.

206
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:51,995
Yep.

207
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,332
So, you know about the meeting coming up?

208
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,317
I know about the meeting coming up.

209
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,255
Can I count on you?

210
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,777
I can't discuss upcoming votes.

211
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,904
Seriously? It's me.

212
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,155
I know.

213
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,948
Dude, you were there.

214
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,474
I know that too.

215
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,518
Gotta go.

216
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,521
Oh, my God.

217
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,833
Ellie.

218
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,920
The council won't make up their mind
until we hear people speak.

219
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,963
So, here's a little advice.

220
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,508
Organize your thoughts, write them down,

221
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,093
and then read 'em out loud tomorrow.

222
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,844
Okay, yeah, 'cause I'm stupid.

223
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,870
'Cause you're angry, Ellie.

224
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,915
And no one's gonna vote for angry.

225
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,235
Which is why I keep
saying we need to invest

226
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,029
more in turkeys and less in chickens.

227
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,282
And that brings me back
to my earlier point about corn.

228
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,451
Corn, some of you have heard me say,

229
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:59,205
is not the easiest crop to grow,
but it is among the fastest.

230
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,125
You can plot a graph
that shows ease and resources

231
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,001
versus time to harvest and get a li--

232
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:07,529
Scott, I'm sorry,
but we gotta keep you on target here.

233
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,008
But it's an open meeting.
The bylaws say that--

234
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,552
Maybe we should stick
to what everyone else

235
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,202
came here to discuss.

236
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,181
I don't really have an opinion
on the Seattle thing.

237
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,124
Okay. Thank you.

238
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,376
So, that was Scott.

239
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,646
Next is Rachel.

240
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,983
Yeah, Joel meant
so much to so many of us.

241
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,943
Can't hear you.

242
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,112
Can you take him, please?

243
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,096
Yeah. Okay, here we go.

244
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,648
I said that Joel meant
so much to so many of us.

245
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,067
But he wasn't the only one.

246
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,112
I lost my sister that day.

247
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,240
A lot of people in here buried family.

248
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,660
And now, you wanna send, what,
you're saying 16 of our best?

249
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,224
Well, while they're gone, who's gonna be
on the wall if Raiders come?

250
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,685
A wall that's barely mended.

251
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,879
And none of you up there can
promise us that all 16 will come back.

252
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:10,550
So, my heart is with you, Tommy and Ellie.

253
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,887
We are too hurt, and it is too soon.

254
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,556
Thank you, Rachel.

255
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,187
Next is Carlisle.

256
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,861
I'll be quick.
'Cause this one's simple to me.

257
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,782
People came and killed Joel.

258
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,327
So, why wouldn't we wanna
take our vengeance?

259
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,122
Well, because we're not supposed to.

260
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,502
Forgive and be forgiven.

261
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,713
No grudges. No revenge.

262
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,840
And I'm not even a Christian.

263
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,653
I've always seen the wisdom in that.

264
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:58,098
That's what separates us from the Raiders
and the murderers.

265
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,809
Our capacity for mercy.

266
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,062
Those sons of bitches
don't deserve our mercy.

267
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,958
Well, of course they don't deserve it.

268
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,359
- That's what makes it mercy.
- Well, to hell with that.

269
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,129
And to hell with you
for saying it, Carlisle.

270
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,297
- Seth, sit down.
- No.

271
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,383
- You're not on the list.
- No!

272
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,534
What the hell
are we all talking about here?

273
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,097
It's not fair.

274
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,099
What, we gotta forgive everybody
when they show up

275
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,059
and piss in our eye?

276
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,876
They came into our house.

277
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,296
They took one of ours.

278
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:34,735
My God, somebody shoots your brother,
you wanna take the locks off your doors?

279
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,885
Grow up!

280
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,763
You idiots, they'll come back.

281
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,309
They'll come back
because we didn't make 'em pay.

282
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,395
And when they come back,
they'll be laughing.

283
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,149
And you'll all deserve it.

284
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,987
Bunch of goddamn victims.

285
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,502
Ellie?

286
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,292
I normally don't write things down

287
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,753
because I normally
don't think before I talk,

288
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,797
which has gotten me
in trouble before, a lot,

289
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:40,241
and it's cost me in ways
that sometimes couldn't be undone.

290
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:45,580
But I can't afford that right now,
because I know what I'm asking is a lot.

291
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,226
I'm asking us to risk
more people and resources,

292
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,270
and at the worst possible time.

293
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:55,441
And I want everyone to know,
it's not because I want revenge.

294
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,818
It's not. It's not about revenge.

295
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,720
What I want is what you
used to give people.

296
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,306
I want justice.

297
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:08,037
Because it's either that,
or we do nothing.

298
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:11,123
That's what everyone else
out there is going to do for us.

299
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,500
Nothing.

300
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,252
A whole world of people
who won't lift a finger

301
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,196
if something bad happens to me or you.

302
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,574
We have a word for these people.

303
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,136
They're called strangers.

304
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,972
Well, I don't think that
we're strangers to each other.

305
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,475
And I want to know
that I can count on you.

306
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,769
And I swear, if someone hurts any of you

307
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,004
or the people you love,
you can count on me.

308
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,632
That's what holds all this together.

309
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,344
Not potluck dinners
or New Year's Eve dances.

310
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:45,032
Definitely not a wall,
because that thing got busted through.

311
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,975
But Jackson is still here.

312
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,373
I'll accept whatever the council decides.

313
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,567
But I am asking you, please,

314
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,612
do what it takes to see
that justice is done.

315
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,576
Not for me. Not even for Joel.

316
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:10,874
I am asking you, please, do it for us.

317
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:16,963
Thank you.

318
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:31,328
The council will now vote on the proposal
to send a party of 16 citizens to Seattle

319
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,939
to find the people who killed Joel
and execute them.

320
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,047
Amy-Beth?

321
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,260
Yes.

322
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,263
No.

323
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,099
Yes.

324
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,603
No.

325
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,272
No.

326
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:18,858
Yes.

327
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,611
No.

328
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,948
No.

329
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,492
No.

330
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:29,994
No.

331
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,331
No.

332
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,921
The vote is 8 to 3.
The proposal is rejected.

333
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,178
Adjourned.

334
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,497
Here we go, nine. Here we go.

335
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:17,959
Grab the ball!

336
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,295
Attaboy, nine!

337
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,816
Oh, shit.

338
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,717
I didn't know you were a fan.

339
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,113
Hell, yeah! I had Tigers season tickets.

340
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,447
Get in the game, Charlie.

341
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,284
This actually isn't that far off
from the '03 squad.

342
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,452
Louie, stand up! Stand up!

343
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,688
You want a beer? I get them from Marshall.

344
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,037
I spotted you in the crowd
at the meeting today.

345
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,372
Yeah.

346
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,852
And I thought to myself,

347
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,420
she's probably been extra busy
these last few weeks.

348
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,773
Brutal.

349
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:08,551
And I'm supposed to see a shrink myself,
you know, to process it all, it's...

350
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,136
I'm the only one here.

351
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,199
- So, what do you do, then?
- Oh, well, I'm an alcoholic.

352
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,619
And I smoke as much weed as I can.

353
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,436
You know, complete fuckin' disaster.

354
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,564
But you're not here
'cause you're worried about me.

355
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,585
Two outs, guys, two outs. Look alive!

356
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,818
I don't know.

357
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,073
You see things that others don't.

358
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,012
I'm nervous she's gonna do
somethin' stupid.

359
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,847
What, you didn't believe her speech?

360
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,540
- Did you?
- Course not. She's a liar.

361
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,645
Well, there's a difference
between lyin' and being a liar.

362
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,254
Oh, I know. And that one? Liar.

363
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:49,258
There was maybe one person
she told the truth to, and he's...

364
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,680
But we can agree to disagree about that.

365
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,620
What matters is you're afraid.
So, let's talk about it.

366
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,021
Okay. Free of charge.

367
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,444
I just don't want her to go down
the same paths that Joel did.

368
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,741
Comin' up with justifications and such.

369
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,246
All he was really doin' was lashin' out.

370
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,833
So, you think she might have
learned that behavior from him?

371
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,562
There it is! Keep it up.

372
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,922
Turns out nurture can only do this much.

373
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,484
The rest is nature.

374
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,177
If she's on a path,
it's not one that Joel put her on.

375
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,031
No. No.

376
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:39,600
I think they were walking side by side
from the very start.

377
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,230
Tommy, I get it.

378
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,127
You inherited her,
and you wanna keep her out of trouble.

379
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,987
Take it from a psychotherapist
of 40 years.

380
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,364
Some people just...

381
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,829
Some people just can't be saved.

382
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,568
- Who is it?
- Dina.

383
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,490
Hey.

384
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,762
I'm just going to bed.

385
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,997
No, I don't think
that is where you're going.

386
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,464
- Are you alone?
- I'm alone.

387
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,283
Get in.

388
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,702
Oh, Christ.

389
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,287
Please don't try and talk me out of this.

390
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,896
You think that's why I'm here?

391
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,733
So, what's your plan?

392
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,153
Go to Seattle and kill Abby.

393
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,696
What route?

394
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,175
Northwest.

395
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:21,637
And is that all guns, or do you
have medical supplies in there?

396
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,745
No?

397
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,475
Well, better not land weird on an ankle

398
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,978
or get a fever on your
well-charted path "northwest."

399
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,963
Okay, so what am I supposed to do?

400
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:41,490
Stay off the highways.
Steer clear of cities or settlements.

401
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,534
First stage
is through the national forest.

402
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,912
Once we're out,
we follow the Snake River Canyon,

403
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,497
then break off through
the Snoqualmie Pass.

404
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,873
Snoqualmie?

405
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,417
Yeah. Snoqualmie.

406
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,796
Approach Seattle from the east,
then reassess based on what we find.

407
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,549
Provisions. Travel light, but smart.

408
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,592
Winter coats for beds,
jackets for blankets.

409
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,928
First aid kits, batteries, bear spray.

410
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,954
Now, handguns.
What are you bringing?

411
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,041
- Is that Joel's?
- Mm-hm.

412
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,187
So, that's what
you're gonna kill her with?

413
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,314
- Fuckin' right.
- Then, save it for that.

414
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,840
It's slow and kicks like hell.

415
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,887
Really? Shoot your damn ass off?

416
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,323
I've heard that before.

417
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,826
We'll want at least 100 shells apiece,
plus 50 rifle rounds.

418
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,370
Bring any long gun you want,
as long as it's scoped.

419
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,206
Chlorine tablets, a pan,
and something to keep Shimmer dry.

420
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,875
- Just Shimmer?
- Yeah.

421
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,710
We share a horse. Fewer resources.

422
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:38,362
Everything else is what you'd figure,
except this.

423
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:40,865
Boots.

424
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,344
Love the Converse.
Respect your consistency.

425
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,555
But you're not crossing
open country in fuckin' Chucks.

426
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,932
- I've done it before.
- No Chucks. Questions?

427
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,602
Yeah, one. How the fuck
are we gonna get all of this?

428
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,960
I know a guy.

429
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,565
Oh, no. No, don't tell me
you told Jesse, please.

430
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,859
Captain Wyoming? No.

431
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,220
I love the man, but he's a little uptight
about rules and shit.

432
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,489
Wear all the clothes you're gonna bring,

433
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,991
fill your pockets with ammo.

434
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:09,244
Everything else needs to fit inside
a holster or your backpack.

435
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:12,355
We'll meet by the old east gate, 3:00 a.m.

436
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,065
3:00 a.m.

437
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,776
Hey.

438
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,072
Thank you.

439
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,802
You know, you could have just asked.

440
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,954
No, I actually didn't know that.

441
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,124
Now you do.

442
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,413
Trade.

443
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,125
It's better. Trade.

444
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,288
How'd you get her out?

445
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,581
Jeanine's night watch at the stables.

446
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,667
She's sympathetic to our cause.

447
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,960
"Our cause"?

448
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,570
You're the one that gave
the "us" speech, not me.

449
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,342
Saddlebags are filled with stuff
I had squirreled away.

450
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,344
Two weeks' worth of hardtack, bandages,

451
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,430
alcohol, meds, batteries.

452
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,174
I'd come with you, but I caught
some friendly fire on New Year's Day.

453
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,625
- You sure it was friendly?
- Jesus Christ.

454
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,211
We got ten minutes
before a patrol comes by.

455
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,380
Let's get you going.

456
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,031
Okay, so...

457
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,658
F.

458
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,243
F.

459
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,598
- Fleetwood Mac.
- Nope.

460
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,766
What?
What do you mean, "no"?

461
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,518
- It's my opinion.
- Yeah, well,

462
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,795
your opinion is wrong
because Frank Zappa exists.

463
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,383
Okay, so, G.

464
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,111
Green Day.

465
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,429
No, you're wrong. It's Guns N' Roses.

466
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,036
Ozzy Osbourne.

467
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,289
Nice! Double points.

468
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:30,792
So, L-M-N-O, P.

469
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:33,360
Are you seriously gonna
make me do the entire alphabet?

470
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,530
We don't have to. I'm incredibly flexible.

471
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,175
Lemme see, new topic.

472
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,261
- Or silence.
- Got one.

473
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,721
First person you killed.

474
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,180
Jesus, really?

475
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,123
Yeah, fun stories of childhood.

476
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:50,937
Okay, well, the first one's too fucked up,
but I can tell you the second one.

477
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,046
I accept.

478
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,067
It was a little before Joel
and I got to Jackson.

479
00:43:56,091 --> 00:44:01,055
In Kansas City, he got jumped by this kid,
maybe just a couple years older than me.

480
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:06,435
And I came up behind him,
raised my gun and, yeah.

481
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,789
Sorry, Ellie.

482
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:13,025
Interesting.
I shoot a guy, and you feel sorry for me?

483
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,320
I'm just loyal like that.

484
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,341
Let me know if you see any outcroppings

485
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,343
- or spots with cover.
- Why?

486
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,951
It looks okay.

487
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,604
Holy shit, that came on fast.

488
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,981
How the fuck did you know
that was gonna happen?

489
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,257
- I'm a witch.
- Clearly.

490
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,118
Well, good night.

491
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,245
Night.

492
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:24,471
Okay, but I have a stupid question.

493
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:35,482
It's about New Year's Eve,
and, you know,

494
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,026
the kiss.

495
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,549
Okay.

496
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,427
I mean, whatever, you were super high.

497
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,137
And you were drunk.

498
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,638
Right, so it doesn't mean anything,

499
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,789
- if that's what you're asking.
- No, I know that.

500
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:52,916
My question is,

501
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,879
how would you rate it?

502
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,942
- Scale of one to ten.
- No.

503
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:03,236
Come on.

504
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:07,014
You've kissed girls before.
You're gay, I'm not.

505
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,476
I'm just curious.
I wanna know if I'm any good at it.

506
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,978
One to ten.

507
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,292
Okay, fine. Six.

508
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,668
Fuck you, "six."

509
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,755
- That's not bad.
- That sucks!

510
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,214
What?

511
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,073
For the record, I don't believe you.

512
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:29,328
Well, you asked, and I told you.
I'm sorry.

513
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:33,433
You can go back to Jesse.

514
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,917
I already did.

515
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,878
Well, there you have it.

516
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,016
Does he ever strike you as sad?

517
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,894
Jesse? Yeah.

518
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,898
Has he ever told you why?

519
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,317
No.

520
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,989
But I think deep inside,
that's just how he is.

521
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,746
- At least, I hope that's why.
- Why would you hope that?

522
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,670
Well, because if it's not that,

523
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,673
then it's me.

524
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,471
Well, good night.

525
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:31,598
Night.

526
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,609
Ellie?

527
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,613
I wasn't that high.

528
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,254
- How much further?
- Close.

529
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,567
Maybe ten miles?

530
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:09,428
In theory, we'll come out
near Highway Five, just north of the city.

531
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,073
He was running away.

532
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,220
What's that symbol?

533
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,246
I don't know, I've never seen it before.

534
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,637
A lot of different calibers.
I don't think this was FEDRA.

535
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:54,848
Dina.

536
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,851
Dina?

537
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,354
Move.

538
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:07,694
You okay?

539
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,571
It's just...

540
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,253
Doing okay?

541
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:12,217
Yeah, I'm sorry, it's just
that's never happened before.

542
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:14,946
I think it was the smell.

543
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,638
It wasn't easy to look at either.

544
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,185
If this was fucking them,

545
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,646
if Abby and her crew did this to people,

546
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,190
to kids?

547
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,362
Yeah.

548
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,284
Let's go.

549
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,191
We're close now.

550
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,406
It's quiet.

551
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,808
Yeah. Too quiet.

552
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:47,270
- Curtis or Viper?
- Both, in all four movies.

553
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,400
Nine more miles.

554
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,445
Nine more.

555
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,972
Fucking Seattle. Pretty.

556
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,685
Plus, no one's shooting at us.

557
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:32,107
I guess there aren't that many Wolves.

558
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,360
There's about to be a whole lot less.

559
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,965
Curtis or Viper?

560
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,466
What?

561
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:44,452
No, that was just me.
I was trying to sound like a badass.

562
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,623
You don't need to try.

563
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,395
<i>Manny.</i>

564
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,606
Yeah, go ahead.

565
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,127
<i>We're moving up to the FOB.</i>

566
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,278
<i>All clear between
checkpoint three and five?</i>

567
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,135
Told me to watch six and eight.

568
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,786
Now, they want fuckin' three and five.

569
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,765
<i>Manny, you copy?</i>

570
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:32,792
Just give me a fuckin' second. Jesus.

571
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,883
You're all good. You can move up.
