1
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,330
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

2
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,175
Fuck you, FEDRA!
Fuck you, FEDRA!

3
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,040
<i>Kansas City belongs to the people.</i>

4
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,795
<i>Collaborators, surrender now,
and you will receive a fair trial.</i>

5
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:13,007
<i>We have control of the QZ
and the open city.</i>

6
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:17,804
<i>Anyone caught hiding will face charges
of counter-revolutionary activities.</i>

7
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,431
<i>Kansas City belongs to the people.</i>

8
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,726
<i>Collaborators, surrender now...</i>

9
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,402
You know, Perry,
I used to be so scared of these people.

10
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,988
Now look at them.

11
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,116
Did it feel good,

12
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,202
betraying your neighbors to FEDRA?

13
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,289
Watching us get thrown in prison,

14
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,916
watching us hang,

15
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,168
so that you could get medicine,

16
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,796
alcohol, fucking apples?

17
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,260
Did it make you feel better?

18
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,263
Did it make you feel safe?

19
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,060
How does it make you feel now?

20
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,358
Well, I'm not FEDRA.

21
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,318
Lucky for you

22
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,236
no one here has to die.

23
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,573
Yeah, we could put you on trial.

24
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,867
You're all guilty,
so that's how that'll go.

25
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,994
And you'll do some time. Easy.

26
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,623
But first, you have
to do something for me.

27
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,752
Where is Henry?

28
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,464
You're informers.

29
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,758
Inform.

30
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,970
Where is Henry?

31
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,768
I guess they don't know.

32
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,483
- Kill them.
- He's with Edelstein.

33
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,031
Edelstein was a collaborator?

34
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,828
Well, he was a lot more discreet
than you fucking idiots.

35
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,830
Where are they?

36
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,792
He said he was meeting up
with Henry and Sam.

37
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,043
'Kay.

38
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,171
He had a place to hole up in the open city

39
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,173
in case things went bad.

40
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,012
But things have gone great,
haven't you heard?

41
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,973
Kansas City is free.

42
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,893
Hole up where?

43
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,937
He didn't say.

44
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,984
I swear, I've told you everything I know.

45
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,070
Of course, you have.

46
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,573
You're a rat.

47
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,785
He's still in the city.

48
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:31,831
Okay, I want our people going door-to-door
until we find him.

49
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,583
- Now?
- I'm sorry.

50
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,418
How long do you think we should wait?

51
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,837
Should we wait a day or two?
Should we wait a week?

52
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,006
Fuck it. Let's give him a month.

53
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,133
I'm not sayin' we do nothin'.

54
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,718
We already got a perimeter
around the city.

55
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,678
We can wait him
out. Door-to-door would take a lotta men,

56
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,763
and there are other things that
probably need--

57
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:50,224
He's not my seventh priority, Perry.

58
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,642
Is that what he is to you?

59
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:55,813
No.

60
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,319
Are we really puttin' 'em on trial?

61
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,365
No, we are not really
putting them on trial.

62
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:09,368
When you're done, burn the bodies.
It's faster.

63
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,235
You sure they don't know about this?

64
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,156
I got it from a FEDRA officer.

65
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,367
Patient.

66
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,369
Owed me a favor.

67
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:37,623
He said he found it himself,
never told anyone about it.

68
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,709
- And what if they get to him?
- They already did.

69
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,711
- He won't be talking.
- Fuck.

70
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,130
Okay. Water? Toilets?

71
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,010
The apartments below
are tied into the QZ main.

72
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,638
We can use those,
but we have to be fast and careful.

73
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,640
- Food?
- Whatever you brought.

74
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,392
I barely made it out as is.

75
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,727
So we're fucked on food?

76
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,562
- Ammunition?
- Empty.

77
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,980
Yeah, so is mine.

78
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,192
We weren't shooting our way
outta this anyway.

79
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,903
No, so we'll sneak our way out.

80
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,322
How?

81
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,074
- Tunnels.
- Tunnels?

82
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,492
Why go to the trouble?

83
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:15,036
You can kill yourself right here.

84
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,998
Twenty cans, and six pounds of jerky
for the three of us.

85
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,042
If we stick to the minimum,

86
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,835
I think we can make it 11 days?

87
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,671
So that's how long we have
to figure it out.

88
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,007
Is he scared?

89
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,261
Yeah. Well, he saw a lot.

90
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,263
Nothin' I can do about that now.

91
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,227
He's scared because you're scared.

92
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,533
What?

93
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,801
Yeah, yeah.

94
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,648
Joel.

95
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,317
Joel!

96
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,489
Eyes on me. Eyes on me.

97
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,243
You don't have to worry about what to say.

98
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,704
We don't wanna hurt you.

99
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,288
We wanna help you.

100
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:40,791
Okay.

101
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,377
Okay,

102
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,548
I don't know what the next step is
with something like this,

103
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,258
but if I lower my gun,

104
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,426
we didn't hurt you,

105
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,720
so you don't hurt us,

106
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,721
right?

107
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,765
That's right.

108
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,101
That's a weird fuckin' tone, man.

109
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,061
That's just the way he sounds.
He has an asshole voice.

110
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,479
Joel, tell him he's okay.

111
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,233
- Everything is great.
- Dude.

112
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,234
Fuck!

113
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,237
Okay. Listen,

114
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,656
I'm gonna trust you.

115
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,291
Yes.

116
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,917
But if either of you guys try anything,

117
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,420
yeah?

118
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,630
Yeah?

119
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,174
Yeah.

120
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,476
Can I sit up?

121
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:42,811
Yeah.

122
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,438
Slow.

123
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,607
Get up slow.

124
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,701
Who are you?

125
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,539
My name's Henry.

126
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,125
That's my brother, Sam.

127
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,378
I'm the most wanted man in Kansas City.

128
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,713
Although right now

129
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,927
my guess is you're running a close second.

130
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,399
- Where'd you get these?
- From Bill.

131
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,944
He's dead.

132
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,089
He says thank you.

133
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,551
I'm guessing you don't have much,
so, this means a lot.

134
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,428
How old is he?

135
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,310
- He's eight.
- Cool.

136
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,145
I'm Ellie.

137
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,369
I'm Joel. Look, you ate,
we didn't kill each other,

138
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,288
let's call this a win-win and move on.

139
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,417
Well, I'm betting,

140
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,918
that y'all came up here

141
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,920
to get a view of the city
and plan a way out.

142
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,506
And when the sun's up,

143
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,717
I'll show you one.

144
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,598
Welcome to Killa City.

145
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,640
No FEDRA.

146
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,058
Not as of 10 days ago, no.

147
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,812
- We always heard KC FEDRA was--
- Monsters? Savages?

148
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,189
Yeah, you heard right.

149
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,359
Raped and tortured and murdered people
for 20 years.

150
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,446
And you know what happens
when you do that to people?

151
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,115
The moment they get a chance,
they do it right back to you.

152
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,575
But you're not FEDRA.

153
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,121
No, worse.

154
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,457
I'm a collaborator.

155
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,170
- I don't work with rats.
- Yeah, you fucking do.

156
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,421
Today you do,

157
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,924
'cause I live here and you don't.

158
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,383
That's how I followed you here.

159
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,386
I know this city, and that's how
I'm gonna help you get out.

160
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,264
Why help us?

161
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,559
I saw what you did,

162
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,977
the way you killed those men.

163
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,271
{\an8}Now, I know where to go

164
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,190
{\an8}but I don't know how to make it
through alive.

165
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,484
- Not if it's just me and Sam.
- You seem capable enough.

166
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,486
- You're armed.
- You're wrong, and wrong.

167
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,113
Never killed anyone.

168
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,324
{\an8}And pointing an unloaded gun at you

169
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,534
was the closest I've ever come
to being violent.

170
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,288
So that's the deal.

171
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,457
I show the way,

172
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,501
you clear the way.

173
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,599
Haven't heard that in a long time.

174
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:11,353
So how are we gettin' out?

175
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,783
Highways, downtown.

176
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,201
Us.

177
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,870
This whole area belongs to Kathleen.

178
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,163
She's in charge?

179
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,790
Leader of the resistance.

180
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,793
You can see the way
we're bounded by highways.

181
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,170
{\an8}They got people posted all around
the inside perimeter.

182
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,256
If we get close, we get caught.

183
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,507
No question.

184
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,050
So how do we get across?

185
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,529
Boom.

186
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,197
Kansas City has a subway?

187
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,491
No, but they do have maintenance tunnels.

188
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,369
{\an8}There's a bunch of buildings all put up
by the same developers.

189
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,121
And they share these tunnels, including,

190
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,497
{\an8}a bank building here.

191
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,207
{\an8}So we enter the tunnels here,

192
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,626
{\an8}travel underground, and pop up here.

193
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,754
Westside North. Residential.

194
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,173
{\an8}There's an embankment on the other side
of the houses.

195
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,382
We head down,

196
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,384
pedestrian bridge over the river,

197
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:26,845
free as a bird.

198
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,765
You're right. It's a great plan.

199
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,141
So what do you need me for?

200
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,397
You noticed anything
strange about this city?

201
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,608
Other than the strange shit
you've already seen?

202
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:43,111
- No Infected?
- There's Infected.

203
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,780
Just not on the surface.

204
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,531
FEDRA drove them underground 15 years ago,

205
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,533
and never let them come back up.

206
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,535
It's the only good thing
those fascist motherfuckers ever did.

207
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,120
So you want us goin' into a tunnel?

208
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,790
Everyone thinks
that it's full of Infected,

209
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,958
including Kathleen,
which means that we're not gonna be

210
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,543
running into any of her people.

211
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,379
But you see, what I know is,

212
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,672
it's empty.

213
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,007
You've been down there?

214
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:08,095
No, but the FEDRA guy that I worked with

215
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,472
told me that it's clean, completely clean.

216
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,432
- They cleared it out. All of it.
- When?

217
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,851
Like, three years ago.

218
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,105
Okay, maybe, there's one or two,

219
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,273
- but you handle it.
- What if there's more?

220
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,275
Or one of those blind ones
that sees like a bat?

221
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,194
Wait, you ran into a Clicker?

222
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,113
- Two of 'em.
- And you're still alive.

223
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:27,864
You see?

224
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,158
You're the right people.

225
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,577
If it gets bad down there, we turn around,

226
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,413
and run right back out
the same way we came.

227
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,497
That's your great plan?

228
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,666
No, that's my dicey-as-fuck plan.

229
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,876
But as far as I can tell,

230
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,130
it's our only shot.

231
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:54,307
They're saying
they're going to help us escape.

232
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,229
Right?

233
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,206
We need to get outta sight.

234
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,293
I think it's this way.

235
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,599
This should be it.

236
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,976
You ready?

237
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,729
Get your gun out.

238
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,378
You see? It's empty.

239
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,214
The plan is good.

240
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,798
"The plan is good"?

241
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,217
We've been down here two seconds.

242
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,426
We don't know anything.

243
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,678
Your dad's kind of a pessimist.

244
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,472
- He's not my dad.
- I'm not her dad.

245
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,474
Just point your light forward,

246
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,684
and be ready to run.

247
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,492
No.

248
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,284
I heard about places like this.

249
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,786
People went underground
after Outbreak Day.

250
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,204
Built settlements.

251
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,581
What happened to them?

252
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:08,293
Maybe they didn't follow the rules
and they all got infected.

253
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,525
No way! I love these.

254
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,992
I have issues

255
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,162
four, five, six, 11.

256
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:55,924
So cool.

257
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:05,058
"To the edge of the universe,

258
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,476
"and back.

259
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:10,647
Endure and survive."

260
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,525
Endure.

261
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,068
Survive.

262
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,779
Endure. Survive.

263
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,240
Fuck yeah, man!

264
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,826
- Hey, keep it down. We're not out yet.
- C'mon.

265
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,452
Can we just rest here for a while?

266
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,371
There's actually shit to do here.

267
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,498
Wouldn't be so bad
to wait the light out a bit.

268
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,959
Safer in shadows when we pop back out
on the other side.

269
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,975
Yes! Come on! Yeah!

270
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,394
Come on. Pass it back.

271
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,105
Yeah!

272
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,274
Okay.

273
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,321
If you were

274
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,824
collaboratin' to take care of him,

275
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,328
I shouldn't have said what I said.

276
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,330
I don't know your situation.

277
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,666
And I'm not sayin'
they should let it go, but.

278
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,209
That was awesome!

279
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,670
All things considered,
seems kinda cruel--

280
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,838
Yeah.

281
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,966
to send a whole army after you for that.

282
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:20,884
Yeah.

283
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,097
- Yeah!
- You know, I wasn't

284
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,851
exactly telling you the truth before

285
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,104
about me not killing someone.

286
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,400
There was a man, a great man.

287
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,820
You know, he was never afraid,

288
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,906
never selfish,

289
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,783
and he was always forgiving.

290
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,580
Have you ever met someone like that?

291
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,582
Kinda man you'd follow anywhere.

292
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,960
I mean, I wanted to.

293
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,962
Well, I would've.

294
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,966
Yeah, but

295
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,344
Sam, he

296
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,263
he got sick.

297
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,641
Leukemia.

298
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,355
Yeah, anyway,

299
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,732
there was one drug that worked,

300
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:21,528
and, whoa, big shock,

301
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,238
there wasn't much left of it

302
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,073
and it belonged to FEDRA.

303
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,408
And if I wanted some,

304
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,410
it was gonna take something big.

305
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,289
So I gave them something big.

306
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,292
That one great man.

307
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,881
The leader of the resistance movement
in Kansas City.

308
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,095
And Kathleen's brother.

309
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,015
Yeah, so,

310
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,017
you still think they
should take it easy on me?

311
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,728
Or am I the bad guy?

312
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,148
I don't know what you're waitin' on, man.

313
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,942
The answer's easy.

314
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,945
I am the bad guy
because I did a bad guy thing.

315
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,286
But you get it, though.

316
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,162
You might not be her father,

317
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,789
but you were someone's.

318
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,041
See, I could tell.

319
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,800
Yeah, where'd he go?

320
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,635
We've waited long enough.

321
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,916
- And?
- We haven't found 'em yet.

322
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,669
What about the man who killed Bryan?

323
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,546
Well,

324
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,758
we're not doin' so good.

325
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,180
Who told you I was here?

326
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,806
Your mom.

327
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,893
Why are you talking to my mom?

328
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,021
We didn't know where you were.

329
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,071
Have you been back to the room
you grew up in?

330
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,906
No. Fuck no.

331
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,949
It's a couple hundred miles away.

332
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:33,242
It's not exactly worth it.

333
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,994
Right.

334
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,584
When Michael and I were little,

335
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,879
this room seemed so big.

336
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,051
I was really scared of thunder

337
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,053
so when there was a storm,

338
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:58,184
Michael told me
that this wasn't a room at all.

339
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:01,020
That this was actually

340
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,314
just a big, wooden box.

341
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:07,568
A big, wooden box
that nothing could get inside of.

342
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,906
And it didn't matter
if there was lightning

343
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,659
or tornadoes or gunfire.

344
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:22,500
He said as long as we were together.

345
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,962
in our perfect box,

346
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,423
we would be safe.

347
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,803
He did that for me.

348
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,265
And he did stuff like that all the time.

349
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,186
He was so beautiful.

350
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:50,153
I'm not.

351
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,990
I never was.

352
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:58,703
He would be horrified
by the things I've done.

353
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,913
And if you've come to tell me

354
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,625
that Michael wouldn't
want me to hurt Henry

355
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,004
that he would want me to forgive.

356
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,174
I know that, too.

357
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,468
He told me.

358
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:19,515
The last time I saw him alive in jail

359
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,520
he told me to forgive.

360
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,321
And what did he get for that?

361
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,950
Where is the justice in that?

362
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,578
What is the point of that?

363
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:47,376
Your brother was a great man.
We all loved him.

364
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:48,961
But

365
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:52,840
he didn't change anything.

366
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,052
You did.

367
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,890
We're with you.

368
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,649
Good.

369
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,205
- Do you know where we are?
- Yep.

370
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,582
The other side.

371
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,357
{\an8}No. No one is here.

372
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:55,361
No one's gonna be here because
my plan worked.

373
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,572
So much goddamn talkin'.

374
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,782
I'm just saying, I delivered.

375
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,660
Make this right, go down the street,

376
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,662
embankment behind the last house

377
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,081
and we're out.

378
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,876
So we cross the river and then what?

379
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,170
- Where ya gonna go?
- Don't know yet.

380
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,422
Well, we're goin' to Wyoming.

381
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,756
What? It's a huge state.

382
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,592
It can fit two more people.

383
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,512
Yeah, maybe we just
call this one a success

384
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,722
and say our fond farewells.

385
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,473
No, he'll change his mind. Trust me.

386
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,516
This is how it goes.

387
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:29,645
He's like, "No, Ellie.
Never, ever, ever happening."

388
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:33,482
And then I'm like, "I'm gonna ask you
a million more times."

389
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,650
And he's like--

390
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,361
Move, move!

391
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,487
Go!

392
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,240
- The fuck is that comin' from?
- Shut up.

393
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,002
Shit. Alright, fuck. Let's move. Let's go.

394
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,046
- What are you doin'?
- Gettin' the fuck outta here!

395
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,631
Oh shit, oh shit!

396
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,470
What do we do?

397
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:10,603
All right.

398
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,646
Stay here.

399
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,521
What?

400
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,275
If you don't move, he's not gonna hit you.

401
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,028
I'm gonna go around,
try to get in the house through the back,

402
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:19,987
and then I'll take him out.

403
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,530
But if you go out there,
he's gonna kill you.

404
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,949
It's dark and he has shit aim.

405
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:23,991
Nobody's gonna kill me.

406
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,326
Then he's gonna kill us.

407
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,246
Do you trust me?

408
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:56,167
Put the gun down, slide it over to me

409
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,878
and then stay up here for another hour.

410
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,423
That's all you have to do.

411
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,595
Please don't do it.

412
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,138
Please.

413
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,702
<i>Anthony? Anthony?</i>

414
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,707
<i>Anthony, hold them where they are.</i>

415
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,917
<i>We're almost there.</i>

416
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,418
Fuck.

417
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:41,670
Run!

418
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,675
Run!

419
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,097
Run!

420
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,433
<i>There's cars everywhere.</i>

421
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,852
Why do you think you're in front?
Clear them.

422
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,360
Go! Go, go, go, go!

423
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,849
- You okay?
- Yeah.

424
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,691
- He's up there.
- Fuck.

425
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,319
Two and two!
Around the back, take him out!

426
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,992
Dead end, Henry.

427
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:39,163
Gonna step on out?
Save us some time?

428
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,583
No?

429
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,462
That's all right. Doesn't matter.

430
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,884
I'll come out!

431
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,095
Just let the kids go!

432
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,847
No.

433
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,057
Sorry.

434
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,809
The girl is with the man who killed Bryan.

435
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,436
And Sam

436
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,356
- well, Sam's with you.
- You don't understand!

437
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,857
But I do.

438
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,859
I know why you did what you did.

439
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:13,656
But did you ever stop to think
that maybe he was supposed to die?

440
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,865
He's just a fucking kid!

441
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,203
Well, kids die, Henry.

442
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,205
They die all the time.

443
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,709
You think the whole world
revolves around him?

444
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,544
That he's worth

445
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,755
everything?

446
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:34,301
Well, this is what happens
when you fuck with fate.

447
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,975
Get ready to take him and run. Yes.

448
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:42,977
Do it.

449
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:49,108
It's time, Henry.

450
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:50,776
Enough!

451
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,366
Okay.

452
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,852
It ends the way it ends.

453
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,128
No!

454
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,227
Run 'em down! Run 'em down!

455
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,826
Run. Find cover. Don't look back.

456
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,578
Run!

457
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:31,413
Help! Get the fuck away!

458
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,831
Get the fuck off me!

459
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,025
Sam!

460
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,322
Come on, come on!

461
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,574
Go, go!

462
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:14,873
Stop!

463
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,269
This way now! Move!

464
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,417
"Pew.

465
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,129
"Pew.

466
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,714
"As the Raven 01

467
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,299
approaches the red planet."

468
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,466
You think they'll be okay?

469
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,136
Yeah, I think.

470
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,098
It's easier when you're a kid anyway.

471
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,648
You don't have anybody else
relying on you.

472
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,735
That's the hard part.

473
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,236
Well,

474
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,655
I guess we're doing a good job then.

475
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,411
What's that comic book say?

476
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,623
-"Endure and survive"?
-"Endure and survive."

477
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,502
- That shit's redundant.
- Yeah, it's not great.

478
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,046
No.

479
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,345
Look, I don't know exactly
how I'm gettin' to Wyoming.

480
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,846
I'm probably walkin'.

481
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,598
But

482
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,393
- you know, if you want to.
- Yeah.

483
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,103
Yeah.

484
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,816
Yeah, I think it'd be nice
for Sam to have a friend.

485
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,569
I'll tell him in the morning.

486
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,822
New day, new start.

487
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,743
"Bingo!

488
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,621
Should we knock?"

489
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,499
Hey.

490
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,075
"I don't see any weird movements.

491
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,285
"Stiff? Negative.

492
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,121
"Damage here in Sector 153.

493
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,747
"Stella, can you hear me?

494
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,332
I read you."

495
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,959
Okay, from here.

496
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,773
Do I not look scared?

497
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,080
"Never."

498
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:52,674
I'm scared all the time

499
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,563
of scorpions!

500
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,158
monster is it still you inside?

501
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,584
Fuck.

502
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,773
My blood

503
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:34,526
is medicine.

504
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,802
I promise.

505
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,352
Promise. Promise.

506
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:23,677
Hey.

507
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,243
- Nope, nope, nope.
- Joel!

508
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,372
Joel!

509
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,345
Ellie.

510
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,808
Are you okay?

511
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:19,899
Easy, easy, easy.

512
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,945
Henry, gimme the gun.

513
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,363
What did I do?

514
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,449
What did I do?

515
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,201
What-what-what did I do?

516
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:34,247
- Sam?
- Henry, gimme the gun.

517
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,001
Gimme the gun.

518
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,336
Gimme the gun, Henry.

519
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,589
Gimme the gun.

520
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:43,798
Henry, no!

521
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,136
Oh God.

522
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,286
Which way's west?

523
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,563
Let's go.
