1
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,784
Henry, give me the gun.

2
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,452
Come on, give me the gun.

3
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,536
What did I do?

4
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,538
Gimme the gun.

5
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,874
Gimme the gun, Henry.

6
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,417
Gimme the gun.

7
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,419
Henry, no!

8
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,731
And the gun.

9
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,234
Who the hell are you?

10
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,778
Just someone passin' through.

11
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,991
Take the gun out, two fingers only,
put it outta reach.

12
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,500
Why didn't you shoot him?

13
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,752
The gun's all the way over there.

14
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,841
- He didn't hurt me, by the way.
- Yeah, I got eyes.

15
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,176
You made him soup?

16
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,387
Yeah, I did.

17
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,931
- It's cold out.
- I'm lookin' for my brother.

18
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,644
- Well, I ain't seen him.
- I haven't told you what he looks like.

19
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,813
- He look anything like you?
- A bit.

20
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,190
- Then I ain't seen him.
- He's got a girl with him.

21
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,026
Can I come down?

22
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,612
No. Ellie!

23
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,700
What did I just say?

24
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,452
Joel, come on.
They're like a thousand.

25
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,371
- Who's this little psycho?
- Never mind her.

26
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,915
I need you to tell us where we are.

27
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,541
If you got a map, why you lost?

28
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,127
Must've missed all the street signs
in the enormous fucking forest.

29
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,128
Ho-ly.

30
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,884
We're somewhere here.
Exactly where?

31
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,261
And your answer better be
the same as your wife's.

32
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,847
Did you tell him the truth?

33
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,098
Yeah.

34
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,434
Are you tellin' me the truth?

35
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,894
Yeah.

36
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,202
Well, you found
a great place to hide, I guess.

37
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,161
Hide?

38
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,164
Came here before you were born, sonny.

39
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,334
- Get the hell away from everybody.
- I didn't want to.

40
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,506
Listen, I didn't mean to upset you
about your brother,

41
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,091
but if you've come this far,

42
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,301
then you know what's out there.

43
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,053
- You seen Cody?
- Yeah, got close enough.

44
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,513
It's crawling with Infected.

45
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:27,058
Yeah, Laramie and Wind River Reservation.

46
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:30,061
Anywhere people used to be,
you can't go there no more.

47
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,814
- So you haven't heard the name Tommy?
- Nope.

48
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,023
What about the Fireflies?

49
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,900
We get those in the summer.

50
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,902
Not the bugs, the people.

51
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,278
There are firefly people?

52
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:46,995
- You got any advice on the best way west?
- Yeah.

53
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,706
Go east.

54
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,459
But you never go past the river here.

55
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,588
- Ever.
- What's past the river?

56
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,798
Death.

57
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,426
We never seen who's out there,

58
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,554
but we see the bodies they leave behind.

59
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,807
Some Infected, some not.

60
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:12,228
If your brother's west of the river,
he's gone.

61
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,568
You're not gonna scare us.

62
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,695
Scared him.

63
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,627
You don't seriously believe them.

64
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,129
They've lived here a long time.

65
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,216
- Put that back.
- They don't know anything.

66
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,760
Never heard of the Fireflies.

67
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,975
Joel? Joel?

68
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,143
Joel, are you okay?

69
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,561
- Joel?
- Shut up.

70
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,687
Holy shit, are you dying?

71
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,731
I'm okay.

72
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,900
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, are you okay?

73
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,234
- I'm fine.
- No, no, but are you?

74
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,236
Because just a reminder
that if you're dead, I'm fucked.

75
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,613
- I said I'm fine.
- Okay.

76
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,493
It's just the cold air all of a sudden.

77
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,331
All right.

78
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:18,252
So let's go and find Tommy
and the Fireflies.

79
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,838
It's gonna be easy.

80
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,966
All we have to do
is cross the River of Death.

81
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,537
The River of Death. Scary.

82
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,540
Don't start.

83
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,835
It's too close to dark.

84
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,211
There's some caves along the river.

85
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,463
We'll set up camp there,
cross in the mornin'.

86
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,132
Good. I'm starving.

87
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,383
Should've stolen two rabbits.

88
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,801
We can get our own rabbits.

89
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,219
You gonna teach me how?

90
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,930
Just keep movin'.

91
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,878
Come down from there.
You're gonna break your neck.

92
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,809
Can I have some?

93
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,728
- No.
- What? Just to warm up.

94
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,896
C'mon.

95
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,037
Yep, still gross.

96
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,214
So I've been thinking.

97
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,259
Let's say we find the Fireflies,
it all works,

98
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,470
they draw my blood and put it through

99
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,847
some of their fancy machines
and make a cure.

100
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,183
Okay?

101
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,392
Then what?

102
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,812
- Like, what do we do?
- It's "we"?

103
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,066
Okay, fine. Whatever. You.

104
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,276
You can do anything you want.

105
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,737
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

106
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,198
It's never been an option.

107
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,909
Maybe

108
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,663
an old farmhouse, some land

109
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,498
a ranch.

110
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,250
Cool. What kind?

111
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,918
Sheep.

112
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,587
- I would raise sheep.
- Sheep.

113
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,048
They're quiet

114
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,092
do what they're told.

115
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,718
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

116
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,806
So, just you and a buncha sheep.

117
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,808
Romantic.

118
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,480
And what about you?
Where are you gonna go?

119
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,447
It's probably because I grew up in the QZ.

120
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,907
Behind you, there's ocean,

121
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,159
and ahead of you, there's a wall.

122
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,786
Nowhere else to look but up.

123
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,914
I read everything I could
in the school library.

124
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,209
Neil Armstrong,
Buzz Aldrin, Jim Lovell.

125
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,586
But you know who my favorite is?

126
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,214
- Sally Ride.
- Sally fuckin' Ride!

127
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,800
Best astronaut name ever.

128
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:07,148
It'll work, right?

129
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,275
The vaccine?

130
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,445
It's a little late to start wonderin'.

131
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:16,782
- I tried, with Sam.
- Tried what?

132
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,035
I knew he was infected.

133
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,370
I rubbed some of my blood into his bite.

134
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,830
I know, I know, it was stupid.

135
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,040
But I

136
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,336
I wanted to save him.

137
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,177
Well, I reckon it's a lot
more complicated than that.

138
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:40,598
Marlene, she's a lotta things,
but she's no fool.

139
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,559
If she says they can do it,
they can do it.

140
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,944
You wanna take first watch or second?

141
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,655
I'll do both.

142
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:58,074
Get some sleep.

143
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,952
Dream of

144
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,414
sheep ranches on the moon.

145
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,291
I will.

146
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,813
Still mumbling in your sleep.

147
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,981
I woke up early.

148
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,608
You were passed out,
so I took second watch.

149
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,110
You gotta wake me up if that happens.

150
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,571
- You can't do things like this.
- But I can.

151
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,490
'Cause I just did.

152
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,867
I'm responsible for you, okay?

153
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,411
Then don't fall asleep.

154
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,956
I was quiet, I checked my six,

155
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,291
I looked for tracks,
I found the high ground,

156
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,584
and I kept watch.

157
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,711
Like you taught me to.

158
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,881
What can I say, man?
I'm a natural.

159
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,562
You wake me up next time.

160
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:11,856
Yes, sir.

161
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,373
The River of Death. Still no people.

162
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,417
Fine.

163
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,686
I'm learning how to whistle.

164
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,812
You don't know how to whistle?

165
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,731
Does it sound like
I know how to whistle?

166
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,607
No.

167
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,612
Seriously, though,
how the fuck do you do that?

168
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,531
- Talent.
- Whatever.

169
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,990
You should teach me how to hunt.

170
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,242
Huh.

171
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,578
"Huh." Like, "She's a girl.
She can't handle it."

172
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,789
You can handle the shootin'.

173
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,459
- Not so sure about the dressin'.
- What's the dressin'?

174
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,087
- The part where you take the guts out.
- Oh, yeah.

175
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,505
Why do they call it dressing?

176
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,840
{\an8}It's like, you should call it undressing

177
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,634
{\an8}'cause it is. It's like

178
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,262
{\an8}undressing from the inside.

179
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,724
{\an8}Still interested, though.

180
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,403
Dam.

181
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,030
You're no Will Livingston.

182
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,032
Yeah, yeah, but who is?

183
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,661
- So that made electricity?
- Yeah.

184
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,539
Don't ask me.
I don't have a clue.

185
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,500
You know, you could've
just made something up.

186
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,793
I would've believed you.

187
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,881
Look at that river.
It's crazy blue.

188
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:53,642
Hey, Joel, what if this
is the River of Death?

189
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,715
Get behind me.

190
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,220
We ain't lookin' for any trouble.

191
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,930
We're just passin' through.

192
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:32,890
Drop the gun.

193
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,236
You

194
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,322
take five steps back.

195
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,782
How 'bout we just talk this through?

196
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,991
How 'bout you shut the fuck up?

197
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,618
Okay, easy.

198
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,416
You'll be okay.

199
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,337
You been near Infected?

200
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,505
There's no Infected out here.

201
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,714
The hell there ain't.

202
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,429
Last chance for a bullet.

203
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,184
If you've been infected, he will smell it
and he will rip you up.

204
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,288
Like I said, we'll just move on.

205
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,874
Now her.

206
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,739
Hi. Hi!

207
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,116
Hi.

208
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,501
You just bought yourself
10 more seconds.

209
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,336
What are you doin' out here?

210
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,548
I'm just lookin' for my brother.

211
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,133
That's all, nothin' more.

212
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,141
What's your name?

213
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,895
Joel.

214
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,848
Tommy!

215
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,003
What the fuck you doin' here?

216
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,673
I came here to save you.

217
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,361
There's more if you need it.

218
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:57,863
Thank you, ma'am.

219
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,449
It's been a while
since we've had a proper meal.

220
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,284
Actually, I don't think
I've ever had a proper meal.

221
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,911
This is fuckin' amazing.

222
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,413
Sorry.

223
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,456
Ellie,

224
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,124
let's mind our manners.

225
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,464
What?

226
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,926
- What's wrong with you?
- What about her manners?

227
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,802
She was just curious.

228
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,096
Kids around here
don't usually look or talk like you.

229
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,807
Right, well, maybe I'll teach them.

230
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,353
And I want my gun back.

231
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,188
They also aren't armed.

232
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:32,898
You know what?

233
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:36,318
I think maybe y'all got a little off
on the wrong foot.

234
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,819
She was gonna have her guys kill us.

235
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,072
Well, we gotta be real careful
about who we let in this place.

236
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,698
But it's all bark.
We're just tryna scare off

237
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,200
those who might wanna try us is all.

238
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,576
Well, you got a couple of 90-year-olds

239
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,370
- shitting themselves out there.
- Ellie.

240
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,080
They say that you leave
dead bodies around?

241
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,456
Those are the people who tried us.

242
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,125
A bad reputation doesn't mean you're bad.

243
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,127
Not always, at least.

244
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,633
Ma'am,

245
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,844
we're grateful for
your hospitality and all.

246
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,723
But it'd be nice to have a moment here,
maybe just for family.

247
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,394
Well

248
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,940
Maria is family, actually.

249
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:18,819
Oh, shit! Congrats.

250
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,782
Joel, say congrats.

251
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,161
Congrats.

252
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,168
- How 'bout a tour?
- Yeah.

253
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,505
We settled here about seven years ago.

254
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,215
Just a handful of us back then.

255
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,509
That section was already
a gated community,

256
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,970
so we built the rest of the wall
out from there.

257
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,307
Stopped most of the raiding parties,
but we still find pockets of them.

258
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,184
- And you said Infected?
- Yeah, but usually smaller colonies,

259
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,477
wandered off from the cities.

260
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,396
All this open country out here,

261
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,106
it's a turkey shoot.

262
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,109
I still got my 700,
but I found a variable power scope.

263
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,736
Sub-MOA.

264
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,612
Can headshot those fuckers
from a half mile out.

265
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,240
- Can you teach me how?
- No, he can't.

266
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,368
- How do you keep this place quiet?
- Carefully.

267
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,494
Being in the middle of nowhere helps.

268
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,039
Not advertising what we have,
staying off the radio.

269
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,708
House of worship, multifaith.

270
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,044
School. Laundry.

271
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,838
Old bank works as the jail,
not that we've needed it.

272
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,465
And you draw power from the dam?

273
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,383
Got that workin' a couple years ago.

274
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,470
After that, sewage, plumbing,
water heaters,

275
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,637
lights.

276
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,765
This place actually fuckin' works.

277
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,352
Hey, Joel, check it.

278
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,693
So are you, like, in charge?

279
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,779
No one person's in charge.

280
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:44,988
I'm on the council.

281
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,323
Democratically elected,

282
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,575
serving 300 people, including children.

283
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,826
Everyone pitches in.

284
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,953
We rotate patrols, food prep, repairs,

285
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,330
hunting, harvesting.

286
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,373
Everything you see in our town,

287
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:58,543
greenhouses, livestock, all shared.

288
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,961
Collective ownership.

289
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,172
So, communism.

290
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,633
Nah.
Nah, it ain't like that.

291
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,218
It is that. Literally.

292
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,594
This is a commune.
We're communists.

293
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,182
- No way!
- That's our newest one.

294
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,392
Couple months old.
You wanna pet her?

295
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,144
- Yeah, what's her name?
- Shimmer.

296
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,271
Shimmer. You're so beautiful.

297
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,690
Well, I'm sure they'd like a shower,
some new clothes.

298
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,818
We can put them in the empty house
cross the street from us.

299
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,986
Yeah. It's a decent place.

300
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,781
Pretty much untouched since '03,
but it's got the heat goin' in it.

301
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,534
- Could do worse.
- Trust me, we have been.

302
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,327
We've been doin' fine.

303
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,167
Well, I'll take Ellie over there
if you two wanna catch up?

304
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,379
Yeah. Okay.

305
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,466
- Joel.
- You'll be fine.

306
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,344
Shall we?

307
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,179
Yeah.

308
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,979
Been a long time.

309
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,652
Doesn't seem like you aged much.

310
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,903
You, on the other hand.

311
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,870
Thanks for still givin' a shit about me.

312
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,129
Workin' on raisin' some hogs, too.

313
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,048
Once we get bacon,
I mean, what's even left?

314
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,595
Christmas trees and bacon?

315
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,638
Pretty decent setup.

316
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,057
So how's Tess?

317
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,436
She's fine.

318
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,646
- All right.
- Good then.

319
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,149
And the kid?

320
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,652
Oh, yeah.

321
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,364
She's the daughter
of some Firefly muckety-muck.

322
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,451
Tryna find her family somewhere out here.

323
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,537
- I was headin' in this direction, so.
- Really?

324
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,539
Goodness of your heart?

325
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,666
There's a payment.

326
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,339
So you know where they might be?
These Fireflies?

327
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,508
Well, they got a base down at
the University of Eastern Colorado.

328
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,970
It's a week's ride south.

329
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,265
But it is severely fucked up
between here and there.

330
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,727
Infected, raiders.

331
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,437
It's not exactly an easy trip.

332
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:25,190
It'll be easy for us, seeing as how
you can headshot Infected

333
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,358
from half a mile away,

334
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,568
which is a bunch
of bullshit, by the way.

335
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,197
- Yeah, I can't go.
- Come on.

336
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,657
I made it across the country.

337
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,951
The two of us can make it
from here to Colorado.

338
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,998
What, 'cause your wife won't let you?

339
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,542
- Joel.
- She the one who kept you off the radio?

340
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,336
Is that why you stopped messaging me back?

341
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,464
After I ditched the Fireflies,
Maria and her crew found me.

342
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,758
They're good people.

343
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,261
They didn't have to take me in,
but they did.

344
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,012
And all they ask
is that I follow their rules.

345
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,431
- I'm your brother.
- Yeah, I'm aware.

346
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,185
They're very protective of this place,

347
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,561
and for good fuckin' reason.

348
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:06,356
- Folks find out we're up here--
- No, I heard.

349
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,400
Wrong people might show up.

350
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,111
So is that what I am?
Am I the wrong people?

351
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,821
- Joel--
- Those things I did, Tommy,

352
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,614
those things that you judge me for,

353
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,199
I did those things to keep us alive.

354
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,659
We did those things.

355
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,411
And they weren't "things."

356
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,288
We murdered people.

357
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,999
And I don't judge you for it.

358
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,085
We survived the only way we knew how.

359
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,087
But there were other ways.

360
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,215
We just weren't any good at 'em.

361
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,758
If you knew the shit
that I've been through,

362
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,635
Tommy, tryin' to find you these
last few months--

363
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,220
I'm gonna be a father.

364
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,682
{\an8}Maria's a few months along now.

365
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,102
{\an8}So I just gotta be more careful.

366
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,818
{\an8}To be honest,
I'm scared to death.

367
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,450
But I don't know.
I feel like I'd be a good dad.

368
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,249
Guess we'll find out.

369
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,713
"I guess we'll find out"?

370
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,674
- That's all you got?
- What else am I supposed to say?

371
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,598
Just because life stopped for you

372
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,393
doesn't mean it has to stop for me.

373
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:35,111
We'll grab some supplies
and be outta your hair in the mornin'.

374
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,764
Gross.

375
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,000
Hello?

376
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,344
Maria?

377
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,547
Oh, good.

378
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,758
Just traded for this.
Go ahead, try it on.

379
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,600
It's super fuckin' purple.

380
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,602
- Eggplant. It fits?
- Yeah.

381
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,021
- Shoes aren't too big?
- No.

382
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,399
- Where's my other stuff?
- Rag pile.

383
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,150
- Did you get the thing I left you?
- Yeah.

384
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,570
- Weirdest gift ever.
- But useful.

385
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,407
- Who's been cutting your hair?
- World-class salons.

386
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,659
Let me get my scissors.

387
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,327
- No. I'm--
- Trim. That's all.

388
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,329
Just the ends, I promise.

389
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,544
So, this was, like,
your job back then or something?

390
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:24,674
No, I was an Assistant District Attorney
out of Omaha, Nebraska.

391
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,427
I put bad guys in jail.

392
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,846
Cool, I guess.

393
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:33,600
I always liked doing hair, though.
Maybe it was a mom thing.

394
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,769
You were looking at the little memorial
Tommy made?

395
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,521
Yeah.

396
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,568
- I'm sorry about your kids.
- It's okay.

397
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,111
And kid. Just Kevin.

398
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,864
Sarah was Joel's daughter.

399
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:56,122
- Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.
- No, it's okay.

400
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,418
I guess that explains him a little.

401
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,670
Look, I'm not gonna ask you
what you're doing with him.

402
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,630
Good.

403
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,548
But there are clearly things
you don't know about Joel.

404
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:08,551
Like how he used to kill people?
I know about that.

405
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,056
- So then you understand my concern.
- He doesn't do that anymore.

406
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,933
- He stopped killing people?
- Innocent ones.

407
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:18,311
And Tommy did it, too.
Are you worried about him?

408
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,316
Tommy was following Joel.

409
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,361
- The way you are now.
- Well, maybe I'm smarter than Tommy.

410
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,612
No offense.

411
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,864
You are definitely smart.

412
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,033
Would've made a hell of a lawyer.

413
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,912
There's a whole lot you're not telling me.

414
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,081
Good.

415
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,917
Therein lies the point.

416
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,920
Be careful who you put your faith in.

417
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:48,174
The only people who can betray us,
are the ones we trust.

418
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,095
You understand?

419
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,516
Now, come on.

420
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,935
Grab your super fuckin' eggplant coat.

421
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,354
- Where are we going?
- The movies.

422
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,319
<i>Elliot Garfield.
I'm moving into the other room.</i>

423
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,824
<i>Yeah. I'm a friend of Tony's,
you know, Tony DeForrest.</i>

424
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,243
<i>That's nice.</i>

425
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,286
<i>I'm an actor, too.</i>

426
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,455
<i>Yeah?</i>

427
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,457
<i>Well, your mother knows.</i>

428
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,875
<i>I see.</i>

429
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,586
<i>Well</i>

430
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,840
<i>guess I'll be seeing you around.</i>

431
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,426
-<i>I guess so.</i>
-<i>Night.</i>

432
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,139
<i>Just met Lucy.</i>

433
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,640
<i>What did you tell her?</i>

434
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,016
<i>That I was moving into the other room.</i>

435
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:40,560
<i>She seemed to take it in stride.</i>

436
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,996
The guys said I might find you here.

437
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,209
Figured I'd save you the trouble.

438
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,345
I shouldn't have said what I said.

439
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,515
I don't even believe it.

440
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,478
I know you're happy for me.
It just--

441
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,481
It's complicated for you

442
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,483
and I'm sorry.

443
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,571
So you gonna let me
off the hook, or what?

444
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,574
This ride to the University,
is it a suicide mission?

445
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,367
No.

446
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,953
It's dangerous,
but it's nothin' you can't handle.

447
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,288
Just prepare and do what you do.

448
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,415
You've had people go that way
and come back?

449
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,625
All of 'em.

450
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,794
What is this?

451
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,548
She's immune.

452
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,636
- What?
- Ellie.

453
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,055
She got infected but she didn't get sick.

454
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:00,890
Tommy.

455
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,019
Tommy, I saw her get bit myself.

456
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,230
That was months ago. Months.

457
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,607
She's immune.

458
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,878
From the beginning.

459
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,300
<i>It was Marlene.</i>

460
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,679
<i>She hired us to smuggle her
to some Fireflies.</i>

461
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,722
<i>It went bad.</i>

462
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,850
<i>Tess got bit.</i>

463
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,186
<i>She made me swear to take the kid.</i>

464
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,897
<i>It was her dyin' wish.</i>

465
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,899
<i>What the hell was I supposed to do?</i>

466
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:56,153
<i>We made it as far as K.C., and then--</i>

467
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,740
You know, she saved my life there

468
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,367
from another kid.

469
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,745
Five years ago, I would've destroyed him.

470
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,999
But she had to shoot him to save me.

471
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,625
Fourteen years old.

472
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:14,130
Because I was too slow
and too fuckin' deaf to hear him comin'.

473
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,259
And I saw

474
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,889
I saw a man kill his own brother

475
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,809
to save her, while I just watched.

476
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,312
And today, I thought that dog
was gonna tear her apart

477
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,522
because it smelled somethin' on her.

478
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,649
And all I did was stand there.

479
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,278
I couldn't move.

480
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,989
I couldn't think of anything to say.
I just--

481
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,410
I was so afraid.

482
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:50,541
You think I can still handle things but

483
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,919
I'm not who I was.

484
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,254
I'm weak.

485
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,298
Lately, there are these moments

486
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,717
where the fear comes up outta nowhere and

487
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,636
my heart

488
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,305
feels like it's stopped.

489
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,603
And I have dreams.

490
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,440
Every night.

491
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,609
What kinda dreams?

492
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:20,446
I don't know. I can't remember.

493
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,449
I just know that when I wake up

494
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,746
I've lost somethin'.

495
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,832
I'm failin' in my sleep.

496
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,794
That's all I do.

497
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,380
It's all I've ever done

498
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,714
is fail her

499
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,967
again and again.

500
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,719
You want me to take her.

501
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,972
I'm just gonna get her killed.

502
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,181
I know it.

503
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,767
I have to leave her.

504
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,311
Joel.

505
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,356
It's why you took off on me, right?

506
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,566
To make up for the things we did?

507
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:03,698
Well, here's your chance
to bring your kid into a better world.

508
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,449
You're younger than me.
You're still strong.

509
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,660
You said it yourself, you'll come back.

510
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,286
You have to take her.

511
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,295
And you can't tell anyone, not even Maria.

512
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,757
Tommy, you're the only one I trust.

513
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:25,511
If anyone else sees those bites on her,
what's under her skin,

514
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,138
they'll shoot her.

515
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,018
It's the last thing I'll ever ask of you.

516
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,396
I swear.

517
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,370
I'll take her out at dawn.

518
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:09,847
We got you in 38.
It's left, left, right.

519
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,362
<i>I have a feeling
you'd rather be alone, Luce.</i>

520
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:28,240
<i>He'll know we thought it was lousy
if we don't say hello.</i>

521
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,201
<i>All right.
But try and be tactful.</i>

522
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,369
-<i>What's tactful?</i>
-<i>Lie.</i>

523
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,707
<i>Hello?</i>

524
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,710
<i>Mr. Garfield? It's Lucy and me.</i>

525
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:45,049
<i>We just came back to tell you
how much we enjoyed it.</i>

526
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,675
<i>I had the best time.</i>

527
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,511
<i>At first,
I thought it was gonna be boring.</i>

528
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:08,906
Ellie?

529
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,043
Is this really
all they had to worry about?

530
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,130
Boys. Movies.

531
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,508
Deciding which shirt
goes with which skirt.

532
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,177
It's bizarre.

533
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,933
- Listen,
- Why are you here?

534
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,146
- I came here to talk to you.
- No, why are you still here?

535
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,064
If you're gonna ditch me, ditch me.

536
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,360
What exactly did you hear?

537
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,948
"I have to leave her.
You have to take her."

538
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,454
You know, I stood up for you
today because I thought--

539
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,546
I made this decision for your own good.

540
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,548
You'll be way better off with Tommy.

541
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,050
He knows the area better than I do--

542
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,261
- Do you give a shit about me or not?
- Of course, I do.

543
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,471
Then what are you so afraid of?

544
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,394
I'm not her, you know?

545
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,691
- Maria told me about Sarah and--
- Don't.

546
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,655
Don't say another word.

547
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,119
I'm sorry about your daughter, Joel.

548
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,080
But I have lost people, too.

549
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:43,250
You have no idea what loss is.

550
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,296
Everybody I have cared for

551
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,924
has either died or left me.

552
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,135
Everybody, fucking except for you!

553
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,471
So don't tell me that I'd be safer
with somebody else

554
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,641
because the truth is
I would just be more scared.

555
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,316
You're right.

556
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,319
You're not my daughter.

557
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,280
And I sure as hell ain't your dad.

558
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,909
Now, come dawn

559
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,162
we're goin' our separate ways.

560
00:43:54,631 --> 00:43:55,716
Come in.

561
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,030
Stables.

562
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,306
You came here to say goodbye or something?

563
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,182
No.

564
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,060
I came here to steal
one of these horses and go.

565
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:49,937
I woulda gave you one.

566
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,522
I know.

567
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,232
Anyway

568
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,068
that was 30 minutes ago, and I guess

569
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:00,823
you deserve a choice.

570
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,324
I still think you'd be better off
with Tommy--

571
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:03,575
Let's go.

572
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,369
Okay.

573
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:26,932
Hold onto both.

574
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,770
General direction?

575
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,690
Head southeast till you hit I-25.

576
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,276
It's right off the interstate.
Shouldn't be hard to miss.

577
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,128
There's a place for you here.
Both of you.

578
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,630
Countin' on it.

579
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,261
Can I borrow that?

580
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,513
Yeah.

581
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,265
'Cause Maria took mine, you know?

582
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,267
I already said yes, Joel.

583
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,276
<i>Adios,</i> big brother.

584
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,918
Close it up.

585
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,276
Wide right.

586
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,403
- You're flinchin'.
- The target's too small.

587
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,447
I made it bigger than I should've.
Eject the cartridge.

588
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,909
And I am not flinching.

589
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,954
- The rifle just sucks.
- Okay, give it.

590
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:14,748
It doesn't aim right.

591
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:15,791
You'll see.

592
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,044
A deep breath in, slow breath out.

593
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,046
You squeeze the trigger like you love it.

594
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:22,965
Gentle,

595
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,384
steady, nice and slow.

596
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,760
You gonna shoot this thing
or get it pregnant?

597
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,223
It isn't gonna work. It doesn't aim right.

598
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,811
You dick.

599
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:02,296
So the way they ran stuff in Jackson,
was how things used to be?

600
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,672
No.

601
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,008
The country was too big for that.

602
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:09,052
Back then, there were basically
two main ways of lookin' at things.

603
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,597
Some people wanted to own everything.

604
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:15,017
And some people didn't want anyone
to own anything at all.

605
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,644
Which one were you?

606
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,646
Neither. I just did my job.

607
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:22,357
Which was building?

608
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,942
That's right.

609
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:26,486
Houses, stores, that kinda thing.

610
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,488
We were called "contractors."

611
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,367
"The Contractor."

612
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,786
That's pretty cool.

613
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,456
Yeah. We were cool.

614
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,916
Everybody loved contractors.

615
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,543
Nice.

616
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,974
Okay, so if you mess up your fourth down,

617
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,434
then you give the ball to the other team?

618
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,770
Right.
It's called a "turnover."

619
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,979
Turnover.

620
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,399
But if you make it to 10 yards,

621
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,360
then you're back to first down?

622
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,361
Yep.

623
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:12,282
So, basically just moving
in one direction.

624
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,492
Basically.

625
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,829
- But violent.
- Oh. Well. There's that.

626
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,084
Well, how 'bout that?
Made it in five days.

627
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:25,712
Easy days. I don't know what
Tommy was so afraid of.

628
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,673
Still time to find out.

629
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,383
"Still time to find out."

630
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,428
"The Contractorrrr."

631
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:49,444
Home of the Big Horns.
What does that mean?

632
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:50,779
Team mascot.

633
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,948
It's a kind of sheep.

634
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,157
See?

635
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,159
One step closer to your dream.

636
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,120
Don't see any Fireflies, though.

637
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,122
They're probably in the middle.

638
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,790
Safer.

639
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,377
This way.

640
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,304
So these places

641
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,807
people would live here and, like, what?

642
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,851
- Go to classes and stuff?
- Yup.

643
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,104
- Even though they were adults.
- Sort of adults.

644
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,690
I think it was just as much about partying

645
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,942
and findin' themselves as anythin' else.

646
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:31,319
Figuring out what they wanted to do
with their lives.

647
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,864
What they wanted to do with their lives.

648
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,409
So I've been thinkin'.

649
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,786
I don't want a sheep ranch, actually.

650
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,163
I mean, if the deal is I can do anything?

651
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,748
That's the deal.

652
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,166
Well

653
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,042
when I was a kid,
I wanted to be a singer.

654
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:47,335
Shut up.

655
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,005
Why is that funny?

656
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:53,091
- You gotta sing something now.
- No.

657
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:55,385
- Come on, man. I'm not gonna laugh.
- You're already laughin'.

658
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,803
Yeah, okay, true.

659
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,765
Well, you're singin' for me later.

660
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,224
I'm gonna save the fuckin' world, man.

661
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,226
It's the least you can do for me.

662
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,480
Fair enough.

663
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:13,945
Are those monkeys?

664
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,989
Must be from the old labs.

665
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,366
Look at them go.

666
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,993
First time seein' a monkey?

667
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,912
First time seein' a monkey.

668
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,751
Lookit.

669
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,090
Here we go.

670
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,973
- Guard stations.
- No guards.

671
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,393
Yeah.

672
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,394
Gun?

673
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,064
Yeah.

674
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,337
There were definitely doctors here.

675
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,682
This is a packing list.

676
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,518
Somethin' you make before moving.

677
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,853
They just left?

678
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,816
Maybe not all of them.

679
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,658
Well, at least it ain't Clickers.

680
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,660
Yeah, no Fireflies either.

681
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:10,664
Maybe in all that research,
they turned into fuckin' monkeys.

682
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,432
That's where they went?

683
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,309
All the pins lead there.

684
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,269
Maybe gettin' ahead of the weather,

685
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,646
better facilities?

686
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:35,939
I don't know.

687
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,067
- This way.
- Shut the fuck up.

688
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,042
Out the back.

689
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,564
- Ready?
- Yeah.

690
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:27,449
Come here. Come here.
Come here. I got ya.

691
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:30,577
Joel!

692
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,864
Joel! Get on the horse!

693
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,075
Get on the horse.

694
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,036
Joel!

695
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,333
Get him!

696
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,250
Go!

697
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:21,836
Get back!

698
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,254
Shit!

699
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,341
You motherfucker!

700
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,768
They're not following us.
I think we're safe.

701
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,896
Joel?

702
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,065
Joel, no, no, no! Shit!

703
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,108
Fuck!

704
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:45,735
Joel?

705
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,487
Joel?

706
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,365
Shit.

707
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,118
Joel, open your eyes.

708
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,745
Open your eyes.
Joel, you gotta get up.

709
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,625
I can't fuckin' do this without you.

710
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:03,711
I don't know where the fuck I'm going,
what the fuck I'm gonna do.

711
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:05,797
Joel.

712
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:12,971
Please.

713
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,474
Joel, please.
