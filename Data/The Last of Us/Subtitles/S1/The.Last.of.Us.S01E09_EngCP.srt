1
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,115
Fuck!

2
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,857
It's me!

3
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:10,361
Anyone?!

4
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,386
Oh... oh...

5
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,562
Oh. Oh shit.

6
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,501
Hi.

7
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,379
Hey.

8
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,051
Oh.

9
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,023
Yeah, you tell 'em.

10
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,233
You fuckin' tell 'em, Ellie.

11
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,035
Okay.

12
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,165
Hi.

13
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,335
Oh, you're so tough.

14
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,381
I got you.
It's okay.

15
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,468
Yeah, it's okay.

16
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,116
Anna?

17
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,415
Anna:
♪ Hold me ♪

18
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:01,045
♪ Close to your heart ♪

19
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,422
♪ Touch me ♪

20
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,053
♪ Give all
your love to me ♪

21
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,195
Oh God.

22
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,407
It's not your fault.

23
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,033
We were delayed
getting out of the zone.

24
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,203
- I'm...
- She's hungry.

25
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,291
She needs to be fed, and I...

26
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,419
I didn't wanna nurse her.

27
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,887
I cut it before I was bit.

28
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,433
Before.

29
00:07:56,434 --> 00:08:02,105
I want you to... take
her with you to Boston...

30
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,732
find someone to bring her up,

31
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,525
and make sure that she's safe.

32
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,235
I can't do that.

33
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,654
And I want you to give her this.

34
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:14,242
Anna.

35
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,411
Her name is Ellie.

36
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,415
I can't.

37
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,919
How long have we
known each other?

38
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,426
Our whole lives.

39
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:37,599
So you pick her up right now...

40
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,519
and then you kill me.

41
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,132
I can't kill you.

42
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,843
Please, please, please.

43
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,972
Please!

44
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,353
Marlene!

45
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,482
Here.

46
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,194
Hold her head...
There you go.

47
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,155
Take this.

48
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,001
Cover her ears.

49
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,258
Ellie.

50
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,844
Ellie.

51
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,557
Ellie!

52
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,309
D'ya hear me?

53
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,561
No... What?

54
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,897
Well, I found this in there.

55
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,149
Beefaroni. Chef Boyardee.

56
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,568
Oh, cool.

57
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,990
And have you ever played this?

58
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,951
Boggle?
It's a word game.

59
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,120
Mm-mm.

60
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,832
Well, if you wanna beat me at
somethin', it would be this.

61
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,463
Well, all right then.

62
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,381
We're gettin' close.

63
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,841
- Mm-hmm.
- Hospital that way.

64
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,927
May be the one
we're lookin' for.

65
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,304
Got it.

66
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,781
Take this for me?

67
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,495
Thanks.

68
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,462
They had a guitar in that RV.

69
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:58,341
It was all smashed up
but got me thinkin',

70
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,843
maybe I should find one.

71
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,095
I haven't played in forever.

72
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,973
In fact, I was thinkin'
maybe I could teach you.

73
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,893
I bet you'd be great at it.

74
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,896
Do you wanna learn
how to play guitar?

75
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,527
- Ellie?
- Hm?

76
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,364
Oh, yeah.

77
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,242
That'd be great.

78
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,811
Okay, so this is
what I'm thinking...

79
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,688
Cut through that building
to get around that stuff,

80
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:57,484
find the skyscraper,
go up and look around.

81
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,987
Uhh, actually, this time
I was thinkin' we blast

82
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,155
our way through that rubble.

83
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,616
I found some dynamite
in that RV back there.

84
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,867
Really?

85
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,744
No, so we're gonna cut
through that building,

86
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,332
find a skyscraper,
go up and look around.

87
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,001
But I had you goin', didn't I?

88
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,437
Look at this place.

89
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,231
Talk about bad luck.

90
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,066
Military drops bombs...

91
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:42,905
not one of them hits the building
you're trying to demolish.

92
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,661
No way up.

93
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:11,391
I get you up there,
you can drop that ladder down,

94
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,352
maybe we go through that way.

95
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,053
Come on.
I'll give you a boost.

96
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,955
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

97
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,916
It's just you kinda seem
extra quiet today, so.

98
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,626
Oh... I'm sorry.

99
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,296
No, it's fine.

100
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,548
- Did you hear what I...
- Yeah, boost.

101
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,677
Got it.

102
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,148
One... two, up.

103
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,862
- Ya got it?
- Yeah.

104
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,239
Okay.

105
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,084
Whoa!

106
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,504
God damn it, Ellie!

107
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,797
Shit.

108
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,717
You stay there!

109
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,385
You gotta see this!

110
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,262
Ellie?!

111
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,348
Up here!

112
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,310
- Ellie!
- C'mon!

113
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,608
- Ellie.
- C'mon!

114
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,445
Just wait. God damn it.

115
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,599
- Don't scare it.
- I won't.

116
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,773
- What are you doing?
- It's all right.

117
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,983
Come here, hurry up.
Come on.

118
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,128
Hey there.

119
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:01,645
So fucking cool.

120
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,983
Aw, where's she going?

121
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,986
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

122
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,866
Okay.

123
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,068
So...

124
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:53,280
is it everything ya hoped for?

125
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,865
It's got its ups and downs...

126
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,118
but you can't deny that view.

127
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,545
Look, I don't know exactly
where this hospital is...

128
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,547
Yeah, we'll find it.

129
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,718
Sure. It's just...

130
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:19,847
Maybe there's nothin'
bad out there, but so far

131
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,892
there's always been
somethin' bad out there.

132
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,687
- We're still here, though.
- I know.

133
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,190
I'm only saying there's risk.

134
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,902
We don't have to do this.

135
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,695
I just... I want you
to know that.

136
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,614
What do you mean? What
else are we supposed to do?

137
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,199
Nothin'. We just
go back to Tommy's.

138
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,494
We forget about
the whole damn thing.

139
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,124
After all we've been through...

140
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,210
everything I've done...

141
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,676
it can't be for nothing.

142
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,390
I know you mean well.

143
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,352
I know you wanna
protect me. You have.

144
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,438
And when we're done,
we'll go wherever you want.

145
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,733
Tommy's, sheep ranch,

146
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,734
the moon.

147
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,158
I'll follow you anywhere you go.

148
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,710
But there's no
halfway with this.

149
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,212
We finish what we started.

150
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,069
- Was this a FEDRA thing?
- No.

151
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,154
Army.

152
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,823
They put these
places up all around

153
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,409
the first few days
after the outbreak.

154
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,995
Emergency medical camps.

155
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,331
Obviously didn't last.

156
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,668
- They had me in one just like this.
- With Sarah?

157
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,171
- No, she was gone already.
- Oh.

158
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,715
So what was wrong with you?

159
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,760
- It was for this.
- Ah, the guy who shot and missed.

160
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,012
I figured that would've
happened later.

161
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,514
No.

162
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,642
- Second day.
- Well, I've gotta hand it to the Army people.

163
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,685
They were way better at
stitchin' you up than I was.

164
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,063
It was me.

165
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,485
I was the guy
who shot and missed.

166
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,126
There's no story.

167
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,127
Sarah died...

168
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,713
and I couldn't see
the point anymore.

169
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,340
Simple as that.

170
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:46,722
And I wasn't scared either.
I was ready.

171
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,060
I couldn't have been more ready.

172
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,815
When I...

173
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,903
When I...

174
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,490
went to pull the
trigger, I-I flinched.

175
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,244
Still don't know why.

176
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,165
Anyway, the reason
I'm telling you all this...

177
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,334
I know why you're
tellin' me all this.

178
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,505
Yeah, I reckon you do.

179
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,305
So time heals
all wounds, I guess.

180
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,894
It wasn't time that did it.

181
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,700
Well, I'm glad that...

182
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,454
that didn't work out.

183
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,208
Me, too.

184
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,093
- We should probably get going.
- Yeah.

185
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,643
You know what I'm
in the mood for?

186
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,228
What?

187
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,439
- Shitty puns.
- Oh-ho-ho.

188
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:30,033
"People are making apocalypse
jokes like there's no tomorrow."

189
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,368
- Too soon?
- No, it's topical.

190
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,328
Oh, I love this one.

191
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,998
"Moon rocks taste better
than Earth rocks. Why?

192
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,334
- 'Cause they're meteor."
- Oh, that's terrible.

193
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,877
- Fuck you. That was actually good.
- That's a... That...

194
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,213
- That's a zero outta 10.
- All right, all right.

195
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,259
"What did the green grape
say to the purple grape?

196
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,636
Breathe, you idiot."

197
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,346
That was a three outta 10.

198
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,223
- Seven, minimum. Uh-uh.
- I'll give it a five.

199
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,184
- Five outta 10.
- Five?

200
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,904
- Joel!
- Ellie.

201
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,407
- Ellie!
- Joel!

202
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,191
Marlene:
Welcome to the Fireflies.

203
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,567
Easy.

204
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,778
Ya got hit pretty hard.

205
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,073
Patrol didn't know who you were.

206
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,869
- Where's Ellie?
- She wasn't hurt.

207
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,579
Not even a scratch.

208
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,624
She's mostly worried about you.

209
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,376
Where is she?

210
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,378
We lost half our crew
crossing the country.

211
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,256
I had five men whose only
job was to protect me.

212
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,550
And I still almost got killed.

213
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,220
How'd you do it?

214
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,222
It was all her.

215
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,723
She fought like
hell to get here.

216
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,935
She would've been
dead on day one.

217
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,481
You are the one person I
never wanted to be in debt to.

218
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,858
But I owe you.

219
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,653
- We all owe you.
- Just take me to her.

220
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,363
I can't.

221
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,157
She's being prepped for surgery.

222
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,620
What surgery?

223
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:43,290
Our doctor...

224
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,000
he thinks that the
Cordyceps in Ellie has grown

225
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,961
- with her since birth.
- Why is she in surgery?

226
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,630
It produces a kind of
chemical messenger.

227
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:53,968
It makes normal Cordyceps think that
she's Cordyceps. It's why she's immune.

228
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,678
He's gonna remove it from her,

229
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,513
multiply the cells in a lab,

230
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,849
produce those
chemical messengers...

231
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,852
and then we can
give it to everyone.

232
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,813
He thinks it could
be a cure, Joel.

233
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,899
A cure.

234
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,490
Cordyceps grows
inside the brain.

235
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,996
It does.

236
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,669
- Find someone else.
- There is no one else.

237
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,837
We didn't tell her, we
didn't cause her any fear,

238
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,506
- there won't be any pain.
- No. No, you take me to her.

239
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,134
You take me to her right now!

240
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,228
Please... you don't understand.

241
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,357
I do.

242
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:53,861
I was there when
she was born, Joel.

243
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,322
I promised her mother
that I would save her child.

244
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,991
I promised.

245
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,952
So I do understand.

246
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,456
I'm the only one
who understands.

247
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,171
I'm sorry.

248
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,924
I have no other choice.

249
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:21,264
I do.

250
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:29,814
Walk him out to the highway,

251
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,358
leave him there with his pack.

252
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,487
Give him this.

253
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,199
He tries anything...

254
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,911
shoot him.

255
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,801
I didn't hear
anyone say, "Stop."

256
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,287
Which way?

257
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,665
Down the stairs.

258
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,651
The fuck are you doin'?
Keep walking.

259
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,405
I said keep walk...

260
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,910
- Fuck!
- Where is she?

261
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,829
Fuck you.

262
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,910
I don't have time for this.

263
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,751
Firefly:
<i>Shots fired. Shots fired!</i>

264
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,299
Do we have enough power?

265
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,346
She's ready.

266
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,517
Unhook her.

267
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,896
- How did you get in here?
- I said unhook her.

268
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,690
I won't let you take her.

269
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,817
Unhook her.

270
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,529
- Move!
- Oh, my God.

271
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,867
Cover her arm.

272
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,787
- Fast.
- Okay.

273
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,752
Turn around.

274
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,779
You can't keep her safe forever.

275
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,907
No matter how hard you try,

276
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,368
no matter how many
people you kill,

277
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,328
she's gonna grow up, Joel.

278
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,831
And then you'll die.
She'll leave.

279
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,040
Then what?

280
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,209
How long till she's
torn apart by Infected

281
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,794
or murdered by raiders?

282
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:08,713
Because she lives
in a broken world

283
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,338
that you could have saved.

284
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,048
Maybe.

285
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:15,094
- But it isn't for you to decide.
- Or you.

286
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,433
So what would she decide, huh?

287
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,603
'Cause I think she'd
wanna do what's right.

288
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,151
And you know it.

289
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,572
It's not too late.

290
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,073
Even now...

291
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,743
even after what you've done.

292
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,913
We can still find a way.

293
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:25,540
- What?
- It's all right. You're with me.

294
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,750
Take it slow.

295
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,751
The drugs are still wearin' off.

296
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:33,756
I was with the Fireflies
and then...

297
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,511
What drugs?

298
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,972
They were runnin'
some tests on you...

299
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,266
<i>and some others.</i>

300
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,896
Turns out there's
a whole lot more like you...

301
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,315
people that are immune.

302
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,860
Dozens of 'em.

303
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:59,907
And the doctors, they
couldn't make any of it work.

304
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,201
<i>They've actually...</i>

305
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,292
They've stopped
lookin' for a cure.

306
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,966
Where are my clothes?

307
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:22,554
Raiders attacked the hospital.
I barely got ya outta there.

308
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,348
We'll find you some
new ones on the way.

309
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,270
Were people hurt?

310
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,819
Yes.

311
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,574
Is Marlene okay?

312
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,125
I'm takin' us home.

313
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,313
I'm sorry.

314
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,214
No, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

315
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,884
Please.

316
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,220
Let me go.

317
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,556
You'd just come after her.

318
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,856
Well, she got us close enough.

319
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,905
We gotta walk
the rest of the way.

320
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,283
Probably about
a five-hour hike...

321
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,244
but we can manage that.

322
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,747
Remember?

323
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,332
Yeah.

324
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,886
You know, Sarah and I used to
hike like this all the time.

325
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,723
I wouldn't say it was
her favorite thing.

326
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,142
She wasn't a fan of the
mosquitoes and such.

327
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:19,272
But she was a big climber...
or scampering.

328
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,733
That's probably the right word.

329
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,359
That girl...

330
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,694
she'd see a big rock,

331
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,197
and just... pew.

332
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,949
She woulda liked you.

333
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,536
Not to say the two
of you are the same.

334
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,456
- Definitely different kids.
- How so?

335
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:40,585
Well, she was a lot more...
I wanna say girly,

336
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,297
- and I'm not sayin' that you're not girly.
- I'm not.

337
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,175
Yeah, you're not.

338
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:50,095
So that.

339
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,764
She was taller.

340
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,933
She had a killer smile.

341
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,811
Again, not sayin'
that you don't.

342
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,771
But you know why
I think she'd like you?

343
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,231
Why?

344
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,942
'Cause you're funny.

345
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,677
I think you would've
made her laugh.

346
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,882
Anyway, I bet you
would've liked her back.

347
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,454
Yeah, bet I would've.

348
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,432
There ya go.

349
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,856
Not much further now.

350
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,150
Hey, wait.

351
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,280
Fuck.

352
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,872
Back in Kansas City,
you asked me about

353
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,041
the first time I killed someone.

354
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,049
When I got bit in the mall,
I-I wasn't on my own.

355
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,259
My best friend was there

356
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,470
and she got bit, too.

357
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:16,055
We didn't know what
to do, and she says,

358
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:19,726
"We can just wait it out...

359
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,607
be all poetic and just
lose our minds together."

360
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,232
And then she did.

361
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,651
And I had to...

362
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,072
Her name was Riley...

363
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,074
and she was the first to die.

364
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,367
And then it was Tess.

365
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,994
- And then Sam.
- That's not on you.

366
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,245
- I know, but...
- Look, sometimes things

367
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,331
don't work out the way we hope.

368
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,833
You can feel like...

369
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,294
like you've come to an end...

370
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,655
and you don't know
what to do next.

371
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:51,667
But if you just keep goin'...

372
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,471
you find something
new to fight for.

373
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,432
- And maybe that's not what...
- Swear to me.

374
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:05,064
Swear to me that everything you
said about the Fireflies is true.

375
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,738
I swear.

376
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,254
Okay.
