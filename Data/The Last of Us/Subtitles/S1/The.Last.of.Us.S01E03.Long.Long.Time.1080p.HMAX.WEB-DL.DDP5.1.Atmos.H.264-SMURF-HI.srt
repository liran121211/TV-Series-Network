358
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,256
Ah, why am I
even saying that?

359
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,426
This isn't for me.
This is, this is for us.

360
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:19,802

they look like?!

361
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:20,760
I do!

362
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,512
Our home isn't
just our house.

363
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,264
It's everything
around us!

364
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:28,477
- Give me a fuckin' break!
- Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.

365
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:29,895
I live in this world.

366
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:33,065
You live in a psycho bunker
where 9/11 was an inside job,

367
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,275
and, and the government
are all Nazis.

368
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:40,031
- The government are all Nazis!
- Well, yeah, now! But not then!

369
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,699
(Frank sighs)

370
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,828
I am asking
for some paint

371
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,663
and some gasoline
for the lawnmower.

372
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:51,041
That's all. I'll do
everything else myself.

373
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,128
- It is not a mat...
- Bill, if you say "resource management,"

374
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,248
so help me, I will run
through one of your trip wires.

375
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:03,512
(exhales) Okay, okay.

376
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:07,850
- Just tell me why.
- I did.

377
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,145
Paying attention
to things...

378
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,440
it's how we show love.

379
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,151
This is my street, too. Just...

380
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,613
just let me love it
the way I want to.

381
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,158
And I'm fixing up
some of the shops.

382
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,203
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Not the stupid ones.

383
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:31,248
Just the, the wine shop
and the furniture store.

384
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,169
And the clothing boutique.

385
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,503
The boutique?

386
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:40,383
- Are-are we hosting formal garden parties now?
- No.

387
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,261
But we are gonna
have friends.

388
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,182
(scoffs) Excuse me?

389
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,103
We're gonna
make friends,

390
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,774
and we will invite
them to visit.

391
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:01,716
We don't have
friends, Frank.

392
00:38:01,717 --> 00:38:05,407
We will never
have friends

393
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,951
because there are
no friends to be had.

394
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,788
Well, I've actually been talking
to a nice woman on the radio.

395
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,708
You what?!

396
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,378
Tess: Well, this really
is just... it-it's amazing.

397
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:18,838
- Frank: Right?
- Tess: Mm-hmm.

398
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:21,966
Can you not, please?

399
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,722
- I'm the same way.
- Oh, you're a paranoid schizophrenic, too?

400
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:30,474
I'm not schizophrenic.

401
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,187
(Tess clears throat)

402
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,899
Well, can I just say,
uh, gun aside, which I get,

403
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,108
by the way...

404
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,445
how nice this is
to have a civilized meal

405
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:44,488
in such a, a beautiful place?

406
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,239
It's been so long.

407
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,492
I mean, I just, uh,
I wanna thank you.

408
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,745
Even if we don't
end up working together.

409
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,621
I really needed this.

410
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,498
We are working together.

411
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,837
We are.

412
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,381
You know what?
Let's go inside.

413
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,924
Tess, I wanna
show you something.

414
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:05,925
- Actually, I have been...
- Bill: No.

415
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,053
- ...wanting to see inside.
- Bring your wine.

416
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,220
- Bill: Not inside.
- Thank you.

417
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,388
- Frank: Yes.
- Bill: Frank.

418
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,346
Frank!

419
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:13,476
(Frank, Tess laughing)

420
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,151
- (door closes)
- I understand.

421
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,653
If my, uh...

422
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,865
if mine...

423
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,286
brought strangers
into our situation,

424
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,870
I wouldn't be
happy either.

425
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,498
But of all the people he
could've found on the radio,

426
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,126
we're actually decent
people just tryin' to get by.

427
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,628
Oh... Well, aren't
I the lucky one?

428
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:45,966
There's stuff we have in the
QZ that you don't have here.

429
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,968
Books, medicine,
machine parts.

430
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:49,135
We can help
each other,

431
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,347
and get that gun
outta my face.

432
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,693
So, what,
you were a...

433
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,322
prepper or somethin'?

434
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:10,824
"Survivalist."

435
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,868
Maybe you are decent
people, maybe not.

436
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:15,161
Doesn't matter.

437
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:18,331
We're self-sufficient here.

438
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:23,337
I don't need you or your
friend complicating our lives.

439
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,005
Is that clear?

440
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:30,177
That fence has got
a year on it, tops.

441
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,265
Galvanized wire already
started to corrode.

442
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:40,020

of high-tensile aluminum.

- Yeah. I mean, it's not a gift.

446
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:56,099
- You'll come back, we'll trade.
- All right.

447
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,746
Oh, and I had this idea
that we should, uh,

448
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,584
we should use codes for the
radio in case anyone's listening.

449
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:02,709
Oh, that's a good idea.
Like, with what?

450
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,545
Frank: Like, I was
thinking, like, the decades.

451
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,382
- Like, '80s, trouble, of course.
- Tess: Yeah.

453
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,427
FEDRA's never

against stray Infected.

455
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:20,706
But sooner or later...
there'll be raiders.

456
00:41:20,707 --> 00:41:23,939
And they'll beat that
fence and your tripwires.

457
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,941

at night...

All right.

Uh, listen,
about Tess, uh...

720

If I'm takin'
you with me,

721
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:09,937
there's some rules
you gotta follow.

722
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:13,648
Rule one, you don't
bring up Tess. Ever.

723
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:16,443
Matter of fact, we can just
keep our histories to ourselves.

724
01:09:16,444 --> 01:09:19,363
Rule two, you don't
tell anyone about your...

725
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,198
condition.

726
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:24,243
They see that bite mark,
they won't think it through.

727
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:25,201
They'll just shoot you.

728
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:29,206
Rule three, you do
what I say when I say it.

729
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:30,958
- We clear?
- Yes.

730
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:32,167
Repeat it.

731
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:36,380
