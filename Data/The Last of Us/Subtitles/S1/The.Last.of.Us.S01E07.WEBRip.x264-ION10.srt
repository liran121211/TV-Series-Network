1
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,918
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

2
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,630
Come on, you gotta help me.
Come on.

3
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,049
Leave.

4
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,927
- Leave.
- Shut up, Joel.

5
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,137
- Take the gun.
- Joel, shut the fuck up!

6
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,642
{\an8}You go. You go.
You go north.

7
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,269
You go to Tommy.

8
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,522
You go.

9
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,479
Give 'em back!

10
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,230
Then pick up your pace.

11
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,192
I'm not running doubles again
because of your shitty attitude.

12
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,361
I don't wanna fight about it.

13
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,487
Fight about it?

14
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,238
You don't fight.

15
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,074
Your friend fights.

16
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,826
She's not here anymore, is she?

17
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,116
What's goin' on?

18
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,827
You've never been
what I'd call well-behaved,

19
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,453
but the last few weeks?

20
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,504
Bethany started it.

21
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,756
Well, Bethany's in the infirmary
with 15 stitches.

22
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,966
- Good.
- Okay.

23
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,175
Just put me in the fuckin' hole.

24
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:04,178
I put you in the hole three times.
It doesn't work.

25
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,140
- So I'm gonna try something new.
- What?

26
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,517
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

27
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,771
You're smart, Ellie.
You're so smart, you're stupid.

28
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:15,481
You can't see where this is going?

29
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,899
Let me help you out.

30
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,234
Two paths ahead of you.

31
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,155
First path.

32
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,532
You keep acting like a grunt,
so you get the life of a grunt.

33
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,160
Up at dawn.
Walk the streets, walk the wall.

34
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,412
Ya eat shit food, ya do shit jobs,

35
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,914
ya take shit orders
from your patrol leader,

36
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,208
who'll probably be Bethany.

37
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,004
And that'll be your life from now
until ya catch a bullet from a Firefly,

38
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,297
or fall drunk off a roof,

39
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,340
or get your hair caught
in a moving tank tread.

40
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,427
There's the other path.

41
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,846
You swallow this pride of yours.

42
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,932
You follow the rules.
You become an officer.

43
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,394
You get your own room.
You get a nice bed.

44
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,563
We eat well.
We don't go on patrol.

45
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,315
We're cool in the summer.
We're warm in the winter.

46
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,108
And best of all,
when you're an officer,

47
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,737
you get to tell the Bethanys of the world
exactly where to shove it.

48
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,367
Why do you even care?

49
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:14,165
I care because no matter what
anyone out there says or thinks,

50
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,667
we're the only thing
holding this all together.

51
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,213
If we go down, the people in the zone
will starve or murder each other.

52
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,090
That much I know.

53
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,553
There's a leader in you.

54
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,515
And one day, it could be your turn.

55
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,600
Or not.

56
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,979
So, which way?

57
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,194
Keys.

58
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,904
Good.

59
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,912
- Is that it?
- That's it.

60
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,000
Can I have my Walkman back?

61
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,476
Lights out, ladies!

62
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,814
Turn 'em off!

63
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,211
Riley! Where have you been?

64
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,713
What the fuck is wrong with you,
sneaking up on me like that?

65
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,257
It was a joke, okay?

66
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,800
I thought it would work better.

67
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,802
In my mind, you loved it.

68
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:17,473
So

69
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,268
how's it going?

70
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,021
- Okay, it's bad.
- I thought you were dead.

71
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,731
You've been gone for three weeks.

72
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,650
I should fuckin' stab you.

73
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,694
No, I appreciate your mercy.

74
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,158
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

75
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,202
I just ran away for a bit, that's all.

76
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,830
If you're going through some shit,
you're supposed to, I don't know,

77
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,540
talk to your best friend about it?

78
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,252
I came back.

79
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,047
- Wait, who gave you the black eye?
- Tell me where you were.

80
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,632
Gimme a name and I'll fuck 'em up.

81
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,302
It was Bethany
and I already fucked her up.

82
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,928
Where were you?

83
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,360
- I joined the Fireflies.
- Fuck you.

84
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,323
I'm not in the mood for this, Riley.
I'm really not in the mood.

85
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,118
- You're a Firefly?
- Jesus!

86
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,369
I told you I'd fuckin' do it.

87
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,205
Talking about "liberating the QZ"
is not the same as--

88
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,291
- Fuck. Where did you even--
- Slow down, slow down.

89
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,001
I will tell you everything.

90
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,337
But first,
you have to promise me something.

91
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:33,716
Sort of crazy, and you're gonna say no,
but then you have to say yes.

92
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,847
Come with me for a few hours,
and have the best night of your life.

93
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,641
No.

94
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,394
- Okay, now say yes.
- I'm not going anywhere with you.

95
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,355
It's-- Great.
It's 2:00 AM.

96
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:51,359
And in a few hours, I have drills
where we learn to kill Fireflies.

97
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,153
Get dressed.

98
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,199
So stupid.

99
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,163
- Turn around.
- You're so weird about that.

100
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,392
If you're thinking about
hanging in the park,

101
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,352
we can't go there anymore.

102
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,020
There's a new patrol
that they just put in.

103
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,856
Well, we're not going to the park.

104
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,608
Okay.

105
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,194
- So where are we going?
- Secret.

106
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,404
Trust me.

107
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,823
You trust me, right?

108
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,825
I don't know.
Should I trust you?

109
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,952
Of course, you should. With your life.

110
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,587
- Guards?
- No, 'cause FEDRA's fucking stupid.

111
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,923
- Ready?
- This better be good.

112
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,315
Not that fuckin' stupid, are they?

113
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,359
Okay, rocky start.

114
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,361
Could've been worse, though.

115
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,156
- Could've been a 7-11 situation.
- No thanks.

116
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,700
I'd like to keep my other eyebrow
in one piece.

117
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,036
Well, since you're so interested
in self-preservation all of a sudden,

118
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,289
maybe you should stop
fucking with Bethany.

119
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,500
- What's that about?
- Nothing. It's stupid.

120
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,794
She had to get 15 stitches.

121
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,671
Maybe you shouldn't mess
with people like that.

122
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:39,300
I'm sorry.
Are you telling me not to beat people up?

123
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,594
You put Carol in the infirmary
for a fuckin' week.

124
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,972
I'm just saying,
you can't fight everything and everyone.

125
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,807
You can pick and choose what's important.

126
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,894
Oh, are they teaching you this
at Firefly University?

127
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,937
Kinda, yeah.

128
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,023
And fuck Carol.

129
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,943
Fuck Carol. Fucking Carol.

130
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,405
- Where are we going?
- Through a damn window.

131
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:17,922
Wow.

132
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:22,009
Look at how that water trickles down
those rusty mailboxes.

133
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,512
This really is the best night of my life.

134
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,138
- See?
- Yeah.

135
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,018
Firefly lights are better.

136
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,896
Congrats.
One point for the anarchists.

137
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,732
- We prefer freedom fighters.
- Whatever.

138
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,945
- How many floors?
- Like two.

139
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,865
What the fuck?

140
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,076
Okay, I'm sorry.

141
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,998
- Two floors. Fuck you.
- I was a tad bit off.

142
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,586
Oh, shit.

143
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,756
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.

144
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,259
- Is this the big surprise?
- No.

145
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,886
No, this guy wasn't here yesterday.

146
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,945
So disgusting.

147
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,956
- Is that real?
- Bottle's real.

148
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,752
This isn't moonshine either.
It's, like, from before.

149
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,089
This guy must've spent every card
he had to get this.

150
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,217
No one told him he couldn't mix pills
with that shit?

151
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,928
I think he knew what he was doing.

152
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:58,480
You're sick.
You know that, right?

153
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,316
You laughed, too.
You're laughing.

154
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,151
Okay, we drinkin' it or what?

155
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,944
Yeah.

156
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,913
- Yum.
- Gimme.

157
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:15,956
Oh, okay.

158
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,633
It's great.

159
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,599
Was that the first dead body you ever saw?

160
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,392
No.

161
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,062
My parents.

162
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,357
Yeah. Sorry. I know--
I mean, I knew that.

163
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,360
No, it's fine. It's fine. Gimme.

164
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,575
Can I hold your gun?

165
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,788
They kinda made me swear

166
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,706
not to let other people handle my sidearm.

167
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:01,752
"Not to handle my sidearm
'cause I'm such a fuckin' Firefly."

168
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,006
- Give me your gun.
- All right, fine.

169
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,681
It's heavy.

170
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,516
'Kay.

171
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,728
Thank you.

172
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:27,361
So, what happened?
You started dating some Firefly dude,

173
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,030
and was like, "Oh, this is cool.
I think I'll be a terrorist."

174
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,574
Yup. That's it.
We're getting married.

175
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,912
But really. Why?

176
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,336
Okay, one night, you were in the hole.

177
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,255
I got bored, so I snuck out.

178
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,842
I was on my way back,
being stealthy like I am.

179
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,844
And this chick popped outta nowhere.

180
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,513
- Chick, like our age?
- No. Like, 40.

181
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:55,973
Or 50.

182
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,434
Whatever.
Anyways, old.

183
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:02,271
She said she was impressed
watching me sneak around,

184
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,314
avoiding guards,

185
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:07,317
and she asked
what I thought about FEDRA.

186
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,736
So I told her the truth.

187
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,071
They're fascist dickbags,
and they're the ones

188
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,450
that should be getting hanged
for their crimes, not the people.

189
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,119
She's like,
"All right. If you want in, you're in."

190
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,289
That's it?
No weird initiations?

191
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,125
Nope. I said yes,
and now I'm a Firefly.

192
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,419
That easy to give up everything, huh?

193
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,715
By "everything," you mean
becoming a fascist dickbag?

194
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,760
I don't know if it's that simple.

195
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,512
Like, in a way, FEDRA
kinda holds everything together.

196
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:39,308
Ya know, as much as I love
arguing with your stubborn ass,

197
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,935
we're on a mission here.

198
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,474
Okay, stop, stop.

199
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,935
- Gimme a second.
- Okay.

200
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,024
Those lights are new.

201
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,027
Yeah, they wired up the block
a couple weeks ago.

202
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:35,239
You know, more people in the QZ,
so more apartments.

203
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,282
So FEDRA's not entirely bad.

204
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,369
Fascist dickbags
starving their own population.

205
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,831
Fireflies blowing up the storage depot
didn't help.

206
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,835
- Propaganda bullshit.
- Yeah? So you don't bomb stuff anymore?

207
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,671
- Not when civilians are around.
- That's propaganda bullshit.

208
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,260
- What?
- One,

209
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,928
it's okay you don't know everything.

210
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,263
Agree to disagree.

211
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,183
And two, we're here.

212
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,151
The mall?
You out of your fuckin' mind?

213
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:16,196
They sealed that place off for a reason.
It's full of Infected.

214
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,115
If it's sealed off, then,

215
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,325
why isn't it sealed off?

216
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,396
It's slimy.

217
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,608
Yeah. It's been exposed for a few years.

218
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,861
So, turns out when FEDRA
connected that block up to the grid,

219
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,071
this place got connected, too.

220
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,698
Not that they know.

221
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,910
So what are we doing here?

222
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,953
Trying to get electrocuted, or--

223
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,581
Pay attention.

224
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,375
You're gonna go through there,
then turn right.

225
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,670
- You'll see a door. Go through it. Wait.
- No.

226
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,089
Fucking turn right, open the door,

227
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,841
tell me when you're there.

228
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,676
- Go.
- Fine.

229
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,428
Are you gonna kill me?

230
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,347
This seems like a perfect place to do it.

231
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,222
I'm aware.

232
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,370
- Are you there?
- I'm here! Now what?

233
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,832
You fucking piece of shit.
Come on.

234
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,897
So

235
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,483
what do you think?

236
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,443
It's

237
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,948
it's fuckin'--
Wait. The lights.

238
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,992
We're fine.
You saw outside.

239
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,284
It's like a big bunker.

240
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:28,870
No one can see shit but us.

241
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,955
Just me and you.

242
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,166
And you ain't seen nothin' yet.

243
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:38,046
Tonight, I'm gonna show you
the four wonders of the mall.

244
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,173
You planned stuff?

245
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,932
No way!

246
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,476
Electric stairs?

247
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,229
- Escalator.
- Escalator?

248
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,065
Go ahead.

249
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:03,905
No way!

250
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:08,618
Check me out, man!
This is so cool!

251
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,996
Look! Backwards.

252
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,792
Forwards! And backwards!

253
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,127
And now I'm not goin' anywhere.

254
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,962
I'm not moving!

255
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,966
- So this is the first wonder, right?
- Yeah, sure.

256
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,469
There can be five wonders in this mall.

257
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,015
Be careful!

258
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,894
- I'm coming for you.
- What are you doing?

259
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,645
Ooh, shit.

260
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,814
- Jesus, Ellie.
- No, I'm good.

261
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,776
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I just tripped.

262
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,319
Okay.

263
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:43,695
See?

264
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,034
You are just a graceful ballerina.

265
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,537
- But chop, chop. We're on a schedule.
- Okay.

266
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:13,517
Not exactly "full of Infected," is it?

267
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,602
Okay, you were right.

268
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,854
Can we, like,
stop and check some of it out?

269
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,482
Nope. Time is of the essence.

270
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,112
Why are some of these stores empty
and some not?

271
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,697
My mom said when the outbreak happened,

272
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:30,492
people started looting
until the military shut it down,

273
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,370
so the stuff that's gone
is the stuff that people

274
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,998
needed the most, or wanted, I guess.

275
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:41,169
Right. So, sneakers

276
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,796
and not soap.

277
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,965
Or that shit.

278
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,595
I don't get why people back then
wanted all this stuff.

279
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:54,224
- Do you need me to explain it to you?
- No. I know why.

280
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,435
- It just looks uncomfortable.
- Yep.

281
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:00,814
What?

282
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,400
Nothing. I was just trying to imagine
you wearing that.

283
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,401
Shut up.

284
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,156
All right, come on.

285
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,574
We're almost there.

286
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,337
- Ellie!
- I'm on my way!

287
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,518
Stop right here.

288
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,437
Close your eyes.

289
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,980
- What for?
- Close.

290
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,776
- Do you trust me?
- With my life, apparently.

291
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,653
Well then, give me your hand.

292
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,532
Come on.

293
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,085
Almost there.

294
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:10,759
- Now?
- Almost. I said almost.

295
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:12,802
Okay.

296
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,264
Open your eyes.

297
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,690
Shit.

298
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,286
What?

299
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,913
- No way.
- Yep.

300
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,033
- What?
- Nothing.

301
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,119
- You're drunk.
- No.

302
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,662
- Yes.
- Not yet.

303
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,663
Gimme.

304
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,134
- Ya need help?
- No.

305
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,059
Yeah.

306
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,437
Come on. Damn it.

307
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,439
Let me see if I can fix it.

308
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,025
Wait.

309
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,864
Did you really leave because you actually
think you could liberate this place?

310
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,784
Don't say it like
it's some type of fantasy, Ellie.

311
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,161
They've done it in the other QZs.

312
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,955
Set things right,
the way they used to be.

313
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,999
Yeah, we could do that, too.

314
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,377
If you come back, I mean.

315
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,796
We're, like, the future.

316
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,799
You know, we could make things better.

317
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,634
We could be running things.

318
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:01,596
You could be running things.

319
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,349
I turn 17 next month.

320
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,226
That's when you get your assignment.

321
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,228
You know what Kwong gave me?

322
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,149
Sewage detail.

323
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,360
Fuck.

324
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,655
Standing guard while people shovel shit.

325
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,657
That's what they think of me.

326
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,787
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

327
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,873
I don't know.

328
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,918
I just-- I panicked.

329
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:36,256
And I ran,
and the longer I was away,

330
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:39,300
the harder it was for me to come back.

331
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,011
Is that making sense?

332
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,848
No, I get it.

333
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,644
I would've gotten it back then, too,
ya know?

334
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:55,150
You know, you're the one thing I missed
from that fucking place,

335
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,904
if that makes a difference.

336
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,740
No?

337
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,251
You know what?

338
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,212
We're two wonders down,
three more to go,

339
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,839
if you wanna keep going.

340
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,801
I mean, I'm on a magic horse
with, like, a million lights.

341
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,636
I don't know
how it's supposed to get better.

342
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,728
Is that a time machine?

343
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:33,813
Come on.

344
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,158
<i>Can you be cool like me?</i>

345
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,784
<i>Strike your best pose.</i>

346
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:49,120
<i>Hey, being cool ain't free.</i>

347
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,623
-<i>Please insert five dollars.</i>
- Fuck you.

348
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,334
Well, look at that.
I came prepared.

349
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,793
Have you done this before?

350
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:58,796
No, idiot.
I was waiting to do it with you.

351
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,763
<i>- Remember, strike your coolest pose.</i>
- Let's go, bunny<i>.</i>

352
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,643
Oh shit!

353
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,769
What should we do?

354
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,395
<i>Lookin' great.</i>

355
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,231
Okay, bunny ears?

356
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,149
- Wait.
<i>- Say "cheese."</i>

357
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,651
<i>Find another pose.</i>

358
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,153
- Back-to-back?
- Yeah.

359
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,532
- Do scary, do scary.
- Okay.

360
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,493
<i>Time's up.</i>

361
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,744
<i>- Thanks for all your cool poses.</i>
- Okay, yeah.

362
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,538
- Get off of me.
- Okay, okay, sorry.

363
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,998
- I gotcha.
-<i>Your photos are almost done.</i>

364
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,833
<i>Let's see how ya did.</i>

365
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,797
- Oh, yeah.
-<i>Thanks for hoppin' on by.</i>

366
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,298
There we go.

367
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,259
Oh, fuck.

368
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,680
That one's not bad.

369
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,808
If you like it, it's yours.

370
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,697
Come on. We got places to be
and wonders to see.

371
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,366
Are we going to whatever number
we're up to?

372
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,494
Fourth wonder of the mall,
and I hope you're prepared

373
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,496
because it's pretty dang awesome,

374
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,040
- and it might break you.
- Don't oversell, man.

375
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,546
Listen.

376
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,391
Riley?

377
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,226
Yeah?

378
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,938
This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

379
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,567
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

380
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,005
<i>This is an emergency broadcast.</i>

381
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:09,010
<i>The Earth is being invaded
by flying saucers from Mars!</i>

382
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,012
Ohh, yeah.

383
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,555
<i>Select a racehorse.</i>

384
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,432
Cool.

385
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,195
Do you have any money?

386
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,741
No, not that useless shit. Coins.

387
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,993
We can't even play once.

388
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,336
- You asshole.
- Yeah, I'm the same asshole

389
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:47,006
that spent an hour yesterday
breaking this fucker open.

390
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,510
Thank you.

391
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,644
Dude.

392
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,980
- Dude.
- Yeah.

393
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,151
- Oh, my God.
- Ya ready?

394
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,569
Yeah.

395
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,290
Oh, my God.

396
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,170
Raiden.
Fuck yeah!

397
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:27,797
-<i>Mileena.</i>
- Mileena.

398
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,383
Dead Pool.

399
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,677
-<i>Round one. Fight.</i>
- Wait, how do I play?

400
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,929
- Smash the buttons.
- There's so many of them.

401
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,268
Boom.

402
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,978
- Use the joystick more.
- Okay.

403
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,900
Mileena wins.

404
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,485
That is such horseshit.

405
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,946
Flawless horseshit.
You ready?

406
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,157
-<i>Round two. Fight.</i>
- No! I'm-- Shit.

407
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,325
Okay. Joystick.

408
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,205
- You're doin' so good!
- How am I doing that?

409
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,540
<i>Finish him.</i>

410
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,208
- Finish him!
- Do not finish me.

411
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,044
But then you wouldn't get to see this.

412
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,384
- Fuck!
-<i>Mileena wins.</i>

413
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,261
-<i>Fatality.</i>
- Fatality<i>.</i>

414
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,763
Okay, that was pretty cool.

415
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,097
Yeah, I know.

416
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,891
How many times have you played this?

417
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,144
I mean, I've been here a few times.

418
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,272
So you don't wait
to do everything with me.

419
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,402
Go again?

420
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,988
Goddamn right.

421
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:41,120
- Ready?
- Round one. Fight.

422
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,956
- Not for long.
- Oh shit.

423
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:47,001
- You're cheating!
- I'm not cheating. You're just losing.

424
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,961
Okay. Just for that. Boom!

425
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:50,755
Boom!

426
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,381
Here we go.

427
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,331
That was a good punch. I can't lie.

428
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,001
- Yeah! Gotcha.
- You are beating my ass.

429
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,170
Jesus!

430
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,130
- Now, what do I do? What do I do?
- Okay, back, forward,

431
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,757
down, forward, low punch!

432
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,476
Come on.

433
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,853
Next thing.

434
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:56,988
It's getting late.

435
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,658
I have to wake up and make my bed soon.

436
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,742
So.

437
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,912
We still have a few hours left, though.

438
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:07,748
Yeah, I just can't get in trouble again.

439
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,919
But I'll meet you here tomorrow.

440
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,133
I got you a gift.

441
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,972
I mean, I do like gifts.

442
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,599
- Is it a spider?
- No.

443
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,017
- Is it a new shirt?
- No.

444
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,393
Is it a water pistol?

445
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,895
- Better.
- Better?

446
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,771
- Is it a dinosaur?
- Possibly.

447
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,773
I mean, I'll be your best friend again
if it's a dinosaur.

448
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,275
Really, my best friend again?

449
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,903
Ellie, you are already my best friend.

450
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,654
Wait, wait.

451
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,406
Is it tacos?

452
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,703
Okay, not tacos.

453
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,215
Is this where you've been staying?

454
00:36:58,215 --> 00:36:59,425
Mostly.

455
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,597
"Volume Too."

456
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,141
Shut up! They made a second one?

457
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,143
Where did you get that?

458
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,523
"What did the frustrated cannibal do?"

459
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,652
- Lay it on me.
-"He threw up his hands."

460
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,280
- Gimme. I wanna go. Okay.
- Okay.

461
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,663
"What did the triangle say to the circle?"

462
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,791
"You're so pointless."

463
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,752
Okay.

464
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,588
Okay, "How does a computer get drunk?"

465
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,882
"It takes screenshots."

466
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,177
- What are screenshots?
- I don't actually know.

467
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,637
Okay, gimme.

468
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,057
Give me a second.

469
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:58,192
Here we go.
"What do you call an alligator in a vest?"

470
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,743
Did you make these?

471
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,664
Yes, Ellie, put it down.

472
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,000
To kill soldiers?

473
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,256
You didn't find this mall, did you?

474
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,924
They posted you here.

475
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,551
A new recruit guarding their stash?

476
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:27,972
We would never use them on you
or anywhere ever near you.

477
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,932
I would never let them do that.

478
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,726
You would never let them?

479
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,811
Right,
and you think they're gonna listen to you?

480
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,153
I mean, I guess we'll find out.

481
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,946
- Ellie.
- It's okay. I'm going.

482
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:44,947
Ellie!

483
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,615
Ellie?

484
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,744
Ellie!

485
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,287
None of this shit was even about me!

486
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,997
- Would you stop?
- Fuck you!

487
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:53,998
Ellie!

488
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,917
Ellie, I'm leaving.

489
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:04,091
They're sending me to a post
in the Atlanta QZ.

490
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:11,932
I asked if you could join
so we could go together.

491
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,020
- But Marlene said no.
- Who the fuck is Marlene?

492
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,688
Marlene is the lady that helped me get--

493
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,315
It doesn't matter.

494
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,194
Ellie, I tried.

495
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,324
Tonight's my last night in Boston.

496
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,096
Why did you bring me here?

497
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,892
Because I wanted to see you.

498
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,354
And?

499
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,690
And

500
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,993
and I wanted to say goodbye.

501
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,668
- This isn't easy, Ellie.
- It actually is.

502
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,420
You just did it.

503
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,882
Goodbye.

504
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,104
Shit.

505
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,480
Riley?

506
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,194
Riley!

507
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,575
What the fuck?

508
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,164
Surprise.

509
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,794
{\an8}The fifth wonder.

510
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:51,133
I thought you'd like this one the best,
so I saved it for last.

511
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,511
I guess that was stupid.

512
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,890
- I'm fucking stupid.
- Gimme the book.

513
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,167
So you leave me.

514
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,419
I think you're dead.

515
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,923
All of a sudden, you're alive.

516
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,425
And you give me this night,

517
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:36,428
this amazing fucking night.

518
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,598
And now you're leaving again.

519
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,808
Forever.

520
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:45,354
To join some cause
I don't even think you understand.

521
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,773
Tell me I'm wrong.

522
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:54,863
I think that you don't know everything.

523
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:02,329
You don't know what it was like
to have a family.

524
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,747
To belong.

525
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:08,002
I didn't have them for long,
but I had them.

526
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,754
I belonged to them.

527
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,340
And I want that again.

528
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,636
Maybe the Fireflies aren't
what I think they are

529
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,847
but they chose me.

530
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,726
I matter to them.

531
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,271
You mattered to me first.

532
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,942
Goddamn it, I wanna punch you so bad.

533
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,487
If it makes you hate me less.

534
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,869
And you're sure about this?

535
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:43,829
About leaving?

536
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,628
Yeah.

537
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:00,637
Okay.

538
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:06,143
And I'm not saying it all pissy and shit.

539
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:12,399
You're my best friend

540
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,111
and I'll miss you.

541
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,786
Well

542
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:26,413
night's not over yet.

543
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,167
One last thing?

544
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,628
Sure.

545
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:45,391
Hey.

546
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,190
What am I supposed to do with this?

547
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,859
- Put it on, stupid.
- But why?

548
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,486
'Cause it's fun.

549
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,823
And this music sucks.

550
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,993
- You little thief!
- I was definitely

551
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,287
probably gonna give it back.

552
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:08,580
Right.

553
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,726
Really?

554
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,146
- Come on.
- I don't--

555
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,356
Get your ass up here.

556
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,077
Come on.

557
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:07,973
<i>I got you, babe</i>

558
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,044
What?

559
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,256
Don't go.

560
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,180
Okay.

561
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,273
I'm sorry.

562
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,238
For what?

563
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:20,963
What do we do now?

564
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,716
We're gonna figure it out.

565
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,350
Get ready to run.

566
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,274
Go! Go! Go!

567
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,098
Get the fuck off of me!

568
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,965
Holy shit!

569
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,566
No.

570
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,157
No, no, no, no, no!

571
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,575
No!

572
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,335
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

573
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,429
You motherfucker! Fuck you! Fuck!

574
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,764
You mother-- Fuck!

575
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,481
There's more stuff over there
you can break.

576
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,032
What are we gonna do?

577
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,787
Way I see it, we got two options.

578
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,081
One,

579
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,959
we take the easy way out.

580
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:49,588
It's quick, painless.

581
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,385
No, no, I don't like option one.

582
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,182
Option two,

583
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,727
we just keep going.

584
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:10,067
What are you talking about, Riley?
It's over.

585
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:14,029
It will be, but not yet.

586
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,450
It ends this way for everyone
sooner or later, right?

587
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:23,079
Some of us just get there faster
than others.

588
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,209
But we don't quit.

589
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,380
Whether

590
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,675
it's two minutes

591
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,512
or two days

592
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,808
we don't give that up.

593
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,978
I don't wanna give that up.

594
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:54,653
We can just be all poetic and shit
and lose our minds together.

595
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,617
What's option three?

596
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:07,165
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

597
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,318
Okay, okay.
