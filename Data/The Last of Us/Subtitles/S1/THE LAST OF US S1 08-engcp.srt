1
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,760
Revelation 21.

2
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,920
"And I saw a new heaven
and a new earth.

3
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,520
For the first heaven and
the first earth were passed away.

4
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,440
And I heard a great voice
out of heaven saying, 'Behold...

5
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,600
the tabernacle of God

6
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,480
is with men.

7
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,120
And God shall wipe away
all tears from their eyes.'"

8
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:00,320
It's okay...

9
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,480
I've read this passage
too many times.

10
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,920
Do you remember what comes next?

11
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,280
"And God will wipe away
all tears from their eyes

12
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,120
that there will be no more death

13
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,160
neither sorrow, nor crying

14
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,280
neither will there be any more pain

15
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,920
for the former things
are passed away."

16
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,440
Do you know what that means?

17
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,040
Good.

18
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,040
When can we bury him?

19
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,440
The ground is too cold to dig.

20
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,440
We'll bury your father in the spring.

21
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,200
Bless you.

22
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,960
God bless you.

23
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,080
We'll get through this, Joyce.

24
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,280
How much do we have left?

25
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,240
Venison, elk, rabbit.

26
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,240
Keep the whole town on rations.

27
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,800
Maybe a week.

28
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,800
Two at best.

29
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,680
Josiah and Martin think they spotted
some deer the other night

30
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,240
couple miles east.

31
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,880
It was dark.

32
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,040
See what you wanna see sometimes.

33
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,040
Anyway...

34
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,080
James.

35
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,680
Yeah?

36
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,720
I sensed doubt in there.

37
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,280
They haven't lost faith
in you, David.

38
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,360
They're just scared.

39
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,000
Not from them.

40
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,440
I still believe.

41
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,960
It's been a...

42
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,360
The last six months have been hard.

43
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,880
For all of us.

44
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,640
But I need to know you're with me.

45
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,520
Yeah.

46
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,560
Good.

47
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,160
Now go get our guns.
We're going hunting.

48
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,160
All right.

49
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,680
You thirsty?

50
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,800
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

51
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,040
No fucking way.

52
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,400
Well, what do you think?

53
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,880
I don't see anybody.

54
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,600
You think we can just take it?

55
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah, quickly. Whoever shot it
is probably nearby.

56
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,040
Don't!

57
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,040
Drop your rifles!

58
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,560
Now!

59
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,520
Turn and face me, slow.

60
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,920
Any sudden moves,
I put one right between your eyes.

61
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,720
Ditto for buddy boy.

62
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,120
You're quite a hunter.
We didn't even hear you coming.

63
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,320
Turn around and walk away.

64
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,760
- Okay.
- Just go!

65
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,880
Okay, all I ask is
ten seconds of your time.

66
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,656
- I just wanna talk.
- I won't say it twice.

67
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,280
Please, just ten seconds.
My name is David.

68
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,920
This is my friend, James.

69
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,080
We're from a larger group.

70
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,360
Women, children,
and we're all very, very hungry.

71
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,440
I'm from a large group too.

72
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,640
Also hungry.

73
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,800
Well, even so, you can't drag this
back on your own.

74
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,440
We're not asking for charity.

75
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,000
We can trade you for
some of the deer. We have...

76
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,280
- What do you need? We have boots.
- Medicine?

77
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,040
Like, for infections.

78
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,360
We do. Back in our village.

79
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,440
- You're welcome to follow us.
- I'm not following you anywhere.

80
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,680
Buddy boy can go get it.
He comes back, you get half the deer.

81
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,760
- Anyone else shows up, I put one...
- Put one right between my eyes.

82
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,480
That's right.

83
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,680
All right, go talk to Howard.
He's got a case with some penicillin.

84
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,600
Bring back two bottles and a syringe.

85
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,480
It's not code, James. Do as I said.

86
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,440
Ten steps back.

87
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,560
Keep going.

88
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,640
That's your dad's gun?

89
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,720
He's the one that's sick?

90
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,120
That's why you're out here
on your own?

91
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,200
Well, look...

92
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,840
It's a four-mile round trip
back to our settlement.

93
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,600
It's gonna be a while
before James gets back.

94
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,400
I have some oil and matches
in my pack.

95
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,920
We could take shelter, start a fire.

96
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,440
Bring him with us.

97
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,280
Go.

98
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,160
You know, you really shouldn't be
out here all on your own.

99
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,200
From where I'm sitting, you shouldn't
be out here on your own.

100
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,200
Fair enough.

101
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,040
So, what's your name?

102
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,560
It's hard to trust strangers, I know.
But I honestly mean you no harm.

103
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,840
And for what it's worth

104
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,640
there's room for you
in our group if you want.

105
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,600
You're inviting me
to your Hunger Club? Thanks.

106
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,560
It's true, we're hungry
but we're still here.

107
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,160
I'm a decent man

108
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,240
just trying to take care
of the people who rely on me.

109
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,480
- You're their leader?
- Wasn't my choice.

110
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,240
It was theirs, but...

111
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,520
- Yes.
- They chose to follow you.

112
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,760
Is this some weird cult thing?

113
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,400
Well, you sort of,
kind of, got me there.

114
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,640
I am a preacher, but just
pretty standard Bible stuff.

115
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,880
- What?
- The whole world ended

116
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,680
and you still believe that shit.

117
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,200
I actually started believing
after the world ended.

118
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,560
Before that, I was a teacher.

119
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,400
Math. Taught kids about your age.

120
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,320
So you went from teacher to preacher
because, what, it fucking rhymes?

121
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,320
Yeah, exactly.

122
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,280
But, seriously...

123
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,600
Well, I found God

124
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,320
after the apocalypse

125
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,760
which is either the best time
or the worst time to find Him.

126
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,080
Hard to say.

127
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,600
But when the Pittsburgh QZ
fell in '17

128
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,360
Fireflies and FEDRA...

129
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,560
I left with a few others

130
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,880
and that's how I ended up
with our flock.

131
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,280
A long way from Pittsburgh.

132
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,640
Yeah, we'd settle somewhere
and then raiders would come

133
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,160
so we'd move again.

134
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,680
And as we wandered, we picked up
new people along the way until...

135
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,880
we ended up here.

136
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,720
Well, your luck had to run out
sooner or later.

137
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,280
Luck?

138
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,280
There's no such thing as luck.

139
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,320
No, I believe everything
happens for a reason.

140
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,080
It does.

141
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,320
- It does. I can prove it to you.
- Okay.

142
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,280
We didn't expect this winter
to be so cruel.

143
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,640
Nothing will grow.
Game has been hard to find.

144
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,040
So I sent four of our people
to a nearby town

145
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,600
to scavenge what they could.

146
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,520
And only three of them came back.

147
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,320
And the one that didn't was a father.
He had a daughter just like you.

148
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
And her dad was taken from her.

149
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,040
Turns out, he was murdered
by this crazy man.

150
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,680
And get this.

151
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,040
That crazy man

152
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,720
was traveling with a little girl.

153
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,280
You see?

154
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,520
Everything happens for a reason.

155
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,840
James, lower the gun.

156
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,936
She is the one
that killed Alec, isn't she?

157
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,920
She didn't kill anybody.

158
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,240
Lower the gun.

159
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,200
Did you bring the medicine?

160
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,920
- Yeah, but...
- Throw it to her.

161
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,560
David.

162
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,000
Back away.

163
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,360
I know you're not with a group.

164
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,480
You won't survive for long out there.

165
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,920
I can protect you.

166
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,760
So you're just gonna
let her get away?

167
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,320
Okay, the fuck do I put this, Joel?

168
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,120
Joel?

169
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,760
Joel, where the fuck do I put this?

170
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,680
Fuck it.

171
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,440
Only five more left.

172
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,640
What is it?

173
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,320
Venison.

174
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,080
Big one.

175
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,320
If you've heard a rumor

176
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,440
yes, we found a girl
who was with the man

177
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,040
who took Alec from us.

178
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,360
When the sun rises, I'll lead
a group out to pick up her trail.

179
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,160
Won't be hard to find in the snow.

180
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,880
We'll follow it
to wherever they're hiding

181
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,640
and we'll bring that man to justice.

182
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,480
You should kill him.

183
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,400
You should kill both of them.

184
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,560
I know you think
you don't have a father anymore

185
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,160
but the truth is, Hannah,
you will always have a father.

186
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,000
And you will show him respect
when he's speaking.

187
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,080
Thank you.

188
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,160
Lord, bless this food
and grant that we

189
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,600
may thankful for thy mercies be.

190
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,840
Teach us to know by whom we're fed.

191
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,480
Bless us with Christ,
the living bread.

192
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,120
- Amen.
- Amen.

193
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,400
Stay alert.

194
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,600
If this man's not already dead,
he's dangerous.

195
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,200
What about the girl?

196
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,120
We bring her back with us.

197
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,800
I don't mean to question
your sense of mercy, David.

198
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,360
We can let her go.

199
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,920
If we bring that girl back with us,
she's just another mouth to feed.

200
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,360
If we leave her out here, she'll die.

201
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,960
Yeah, but maybe that's God's will.

202
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,560
Joel. Joel, wake up.

203
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,840
Joel, wake the fuck up. Joel.

204
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,600
Okay... look at me.

205
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,760
There are men coming, okay?

206
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,680
I'm gonna lead them away from you,
but if anybody makes it down here

207
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
you fucking kill them.

208
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,880
You got it?

209
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,160
Joel.

210
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,560
Joel, do not fall asleep.

211
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,760
Come on.

212
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,680
Hey, motherfuckers!

213
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,240
Shit!

214
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,440
Go! Let's go.

215
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,920
Alive!

216
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,320
Keep coming, fuckers.

217
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,840
I got her!

218
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,360
Do it.

219
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,080
Two of you with me. Drag the horse.

220
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,360
The rest of you, stay here.
Go door-to-door.

221
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,120
You so hungry for vengeance?

222
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,440
Deliver it.

223
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,600
I started worrying
you wouldn't wake up.

224
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,880
Let me out.

225
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,160
Well, that's certainly the goal.

226
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,960
Hungry?

227
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,720
Why am I in a cage?

228
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,360
Because I'm afraid of you.

229
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,320
You're a dangerous person.
You've certainly proven that.

230
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,440
The others, they want me to kill you
for all that's happened.

231
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,120
Did you hear me say
the others wanna kill you?

232
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,240
Yeah.

233
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,600
- But I stopped them.
- Fuck you.

234
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,160
Why don't we just start
with your name?

235
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,680
Eat shit.

236
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,160
Hey, listen to me!

237
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,440
You can't survive on your own.

238
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,880
No one can.

239
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,920
But I can help you.

240
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,680
Let me protect you.

241
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,920
I'm not on my own.

242
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,200
Right. Your friend.

243
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,920
And how is he?

244
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,560
I can see how much
you care about him

245
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,240
so I know it hurts.

246
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,520
But even so

247
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,120
you gotta face reality.

248
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,600
That part of your life, it's ending.

249
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,280
And what I'm offering you
is a beginning.

250
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,800
But if you can't find a way
to trust me

251
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,360
then, yes, you are alone.

252
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,240
Timothy?

253
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,440
Oh, shit.

254
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,720
Stop, stop. Please.

255
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,280
- Leave him alone.
- You're next.

256
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,000
Please

257
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,640
I don't know any girl.

258
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,680
- Oh, fuck!
- Jesus!

259
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,720
- Marco.
- No... no.

260
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,160
He can't help you.
You focus right here.

261
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,440
Or I'll pop your fucking kneecap off.

262
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,720
She's alive.

263
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,560
Where?

264
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,120
Fuck! Fuck! The town!

265
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,680
What town?

266
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,680
Silver Lake.

267
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,360
It's not a real town name.

268
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,880
It's a resort.

269
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,320
A resort?

270
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,240
You're gonna point to where we are

271
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,600
and where your "resort" is.

272
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,200
And it better be the exact same spot
your buddy points to.

273
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,640
Okay.

274
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,080
That's where we are.

275
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,040
I swear.

276
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,840
Go ask him. He'll tell you.
I'm not lying.

277
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,080
No, no!

278
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,200
Shit! Jesus! No!

279
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,280
Why the fuck did you do that?

280
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,200
He told you what you wanted!

281
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,520
You motherfucker. Fuck you.

282
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,440
I ain't telling you shit.

283
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,120
- It's okay, I believe him.
- No, no.

284
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,400
No!

285
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,320
For what it's worth,
this is just deer meat. I swear.

286
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,960
You're gonna chop me up
into little pieces.

287
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,720
I'd rather not.

288
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,480
Please, just tell me your name.

289
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,440
- If you wanna judge me...
- Judge you?

290
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,320
You're eating people, you sick fuck!

291
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,760
Yes.

292
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,680
There are only a few of us that know.

293
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,120
But I would've told you.

294
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,520
Sooner or later. I guess sooner.

295
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,600
- You're an animal.
- Well, yes, we all are.

296
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,120
That's sort of the point.

297
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,320
It was a last resort.

298
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,120
You think it doesn't shame me?

299
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,560
But what was I supposed to do?

300
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,000
Let them starve?

301
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,520
These people who put
their lives in my hands

302
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,880
who expect me to keep them safe,
who love me?

303
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,360
Yeah, maybe.

304
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,800
You don't believe that.

305
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,360
I don't think
your friend would either.

306
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,960
Didn't he take another man's life
to save yours?

307
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,920
He was defending himself.

308
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,880
He was defending you.

309
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,760
But you knew that.

310
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,720
You see a lot.

311
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,280
So do I.

312
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,760
And you know what I see
when I look at you?

313
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,880
Me.

314
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,400
You remind me of me.

315
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,280
You're a natural leader,
you're smart, loyal.

316
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,200
Violent.

317
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,840
You don't know anything about me.

318
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,200
But I do.

319
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,720
If I let you out of that cage
right now

320
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,680
put that knife of yours in your hand

321
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,840
you'd stick me in a second.

322
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,120
You have a violent heart.

323
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,840
And I should know.

324
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,640
I've always had a violent heart.

325
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,120
And I struggled with it
for a long time.

326
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,080
But, then, the world ended
and I was shown the truth.

327
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,120
Right, by God.

328
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,400
No.

329
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,840
By cordyceps.

330
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,440
What does cordyceps do? Is it evil?

331
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,720
No.

332
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,040
It's fruitful. It multiplies.

333
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,120
It feeds and protects its children

334
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,280
and it secures its future
with violence, if it must.

335
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,400
It loves.

336
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,280
Why are you telling me all of this?

337
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,360
Because you can handle it.

338
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,880
The way the others can't.

339
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,200
They need God. They need heaven.

340
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,480
They need...

341
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,800
they need a father.

342
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,920
You don't.

343
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,600
You're beyond that.

344
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,440
I'm a shepherd surrounded by sheep

345
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,160
and all I want...

346
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,800
is an equal.

347
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,560
A friend.

348
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,720
What about my friend?

349
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,120
Like I said, loyal.

350
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,560
I can tell the others
to stop looking for him.

351
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,400
They'll spare him.

352
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,680
Really?

353
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,040
They'll just let him go?

354
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,520
Yes.

355
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,680
If he leaves us in peace,
they will just let him go.

356
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,480
They do what I tell them to do.

357
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,560
They follow me.

358
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,040
And they would follow us.

359
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,800
Lord knows I could use the help. I...

360
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,640
Look what's happened.

361
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,320
Think of what we could do together,
as strong as we are.

362
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,760
We'd make this place perfect.

363
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,920
We'd grow, spread out.

364
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,960
And we'd do whatever we needed
for our people.

365
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,280
Imagine the life we could give them.

366
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,760
Imagine the life we could build.

367
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,320
You little cunt.

368
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,840
Let's see what I go tell
the others now.

369
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,440
Ellie.

370
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
What?

371
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,680
Tell them
that Ellie is the little girl

372
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,200
who broke your fucking finger!

373
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,200
How did you put it?

374
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,040
"Tiny little pieces"?

375
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,240
No... no!

376
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,880
Get off of me!

377
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,200
Get off!

378
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,040
- Wait, wait!
- Shut up!

379
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,520
Wait... wait!

380
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,160
Don't! Don't do it!
Please, don't do it!

381
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,280
- Please, don't! Don't!
- You had your chance.

382
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,920
I'm infected!

383
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,720
I'm infected.

384
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,440
And now so are you.

385
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,040
Roll up my sleeve.
Look at it. Look at it!

386
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,080
What did you say?

387
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,160
Everything happens
for a reason, right?

388
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,040
David.

389
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,720
No.

390
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,640
No, she would've turned by now.
This isn't real.

391
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,040
It looks pretty fucking real to me.

392
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,160
There's no way out, Ellie.

393
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,520
The doors are locked
and I have the keys.

394
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,800
Ellie?

395
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,040
Ellie!

396
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,520
Ellie.

397
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,720
I know you're not infected.

398
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,040
No one infected fights this hard
to stay alive.

399
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,880
So how did you do it?

400
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,480
What's the secret?

401
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,520
Or are you just that fucking special?

402
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,360
No one likes being humiliated, Ellie.

403
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,240
You don't know how good I am!

404
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,040
You don't know
what I could've given you!

405
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,800
If you would just let me!

406
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,440
Well, I have news for you.

407
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,320
Neither one of us is dying today.

408
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,400
You see, I've changed my mind.

409
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,920
I've decided you do need a father.

410
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,040
So I'm gonna keep you

411
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,400
and I'm gonna teach you.

412
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,720
Ellie.

413
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,120
Ellie.

414
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,160
Fuck.

415
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,920
I thought you already knew.

416
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,080
The fighting is the part
I like the most.

417
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,760
Don't be afraid.

418
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,400
"There's no fear in love."

419
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,360
No! Get off of me!

420
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,120
Get off!

421
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,120
- It's me.
- Get...

422
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,080
It's me.

423
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,520
Hey, look.

424
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,320
It's me...

425
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,200
- It's okay.
- He...

426
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,920
It's okay.

427
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,480
It's okay, baby girl.

428
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,160
I got you.

429
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,000
I got you.

430
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,760
Okay.
