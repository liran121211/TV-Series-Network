JAKARTA, INDONESIA
SEPTEMBER 24th, 2003

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,315
KEMENTERIAN KESEHATAN
REPUBLIK INDONESIA

3
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,278
THE LAST OF US

4
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,948
Morning.

5
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,298
-Do I look like I'm infected?
-Show us your arm.

6
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,517
Yeah, it's not getting any worse, is it?

7
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,772
If we're out in the open city,
why aren't we getting swarmed?

8
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,982
-Don't worry about that.
-Well, I'm gonna.

9
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,360
What was Marlene doing
with an infected kid?

10
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,986
I'm not infected.

11
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,825
She found me after I was bitten.

12
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,827
-And she didn't shoot you.
-Clearly not.

13
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,663
She locked me up
and had her guys test me every day

14
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,789
to see if I was getting sick.

15
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,040
Test you how?

16
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,710
-I have to pee.
-Test you, how?

17
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,130
They'd make me count to 10
and hold out my hand

18
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,089
and then keep it steady.

19
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,549
But, you know,
I think what really impressed them

20
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:00,177
was the fact that I didn't
turn into a fucking monster.

21
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,846
Now can I please?

22
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,518
Fine.

23
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,271
Back there. You can find a spot.

24
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,818
And here.

25
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,114
Tear out a few pages.

26
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,908
There's not gonna be
anything bad in here?

27
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:23,868
Just you.

28
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,494
Oh, funny.

29
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,798
Broken.

30
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,344
Maybe a hairline. It'll heal fast.

31
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:52,897
She made it through
the fuckin' night, Joel.

32
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,064
It doesn't matter.

33
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,692
It's gonna happen sooner or later.

34
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,653
All right?
We're still close to the wall.

35
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,946
We sneak her back into the QZ.

36
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,698
We find a different way
to get the battery.

37
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,909
This is our best shot.

38
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,955
We take her back to the QZ,
someone's gonna notice her arm,

39
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,500
they're gonna scan her,
then they'll kill her.

40
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,210
Well, better them then us.

41
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,128
You need to stop talkin' about this kid

42
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,756
like she's got some kinda life
in front of her.

43
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,851
You hungry?

44
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,937
You can share some of ours.

45
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,564
Thanks.
Marlene sent me with my own.

46
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,167
Is that chicken?

47
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,377
Yeah.

48
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,672
Marlene said they get it from smugglers.

49
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,133
Guess not you guys.

50
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,681
-Hey. Hey!
-Why--

51
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,225
why are you so important to Marlene?

52
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,228
And don't lie to me
or we'll take you back.

53
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,230
You take me back,
you don't get your battery.

54
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,856
You heard that?

55
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,110
Then you must've heard
that he wants to shoot you.

56
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,451
I'm gonna talk to you
like you're an adult.

57
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,744
Okay?

58
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,746
Joel and I aren't good people.

59
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,624
We're doin' this for us

60
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,960
because, apparently,
you're worth something.

61
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,255
But we don't know what you're worth
if we don't know what we have.

62
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,049
So answer my question.

63
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,434
She told me not to tell anybody,

64
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,644
and now I'm telling
the first people that I--

65
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,278
There's a Firefly base camp
somewhere out west,

66
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,654
with doctors.

67
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,406
They're working on a cure.

68
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,365
I've heard this before.

69
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,285
And whatever happened to me,
is the key to finding the vaccine.

70
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,953
That's what this is?

71
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,955
We've heard this a million times.

72
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,541
Vaccines, miracle cures.
None of it works.

73
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,043
-Ever.
-Fuck you, man. I didn't ask for this.

74
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,210
You and me both.

75
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,463
This isn't gonna end well, Tess.

76
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,089
We need to go back.

77
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,515
Let's just finish it.

78
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,852
It doesn't matter if she is
or she isn't what the Fireflies say.

79
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:39,938
If they believe that she is then,

80
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,441
we get what we want.

81
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,326
If she so much as twitches.

82
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,787
Don't.

83
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,707
Okay.

84
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,421
Okay?

85
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:08,801
Okay.

86
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,188
Can I have a gun?

87
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,481
-Absolutely not.
-No.

88
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,526
Okay, Jesus. Fine. I'll have to throw
a fuckin' sandwich at them.

89
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,336
It's clear.

90
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,361
Yeah, looks different
in the daylight, huh?

91
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,253
We should get movin'.

92
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,018
It's like a fucked-up moon.

93
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,729
-Is this where they bombed?
-Yeah.

94
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,273
They hit most of the big cities like this.

95
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,400
They had to slow the spread somehow.

96
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,030
Worked here,
but it didn't in most places.

97
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,082
So, the State House is across there.

98
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,794
It's about a 10-minute walk
if you could go straight.

99
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,213
-So?
-Long way or short way?

100
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,424
I mean, it's the long way
or the "we're fuckin' dead" way.

101
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:16,053
Well, I vote long way
just based on that limited information.

102
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,640
We have to check it from the hotel first.

103
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,142
Okay.

104
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,662
Where the fuck are they already?

105
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,997
You'll know it when they're close.

106
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,624
I didn't know last time.

107
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,378
How did you get bit?

108
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,881
You know the old mall in the QZ?

109
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,466
The one that's sealed off
and boarded up,

110
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,468
and no one's supposed to go in, ever?

111
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,678
That one?

112
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,097
Whatever. I snuck in.

113
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,933
Wanted to see what it was like.

114
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,393
Didn't think there was
gonna be anything in there,

115
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,020
and then one just
came at me outta nowhere.

116
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,648
Thought I got away, but.

117
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:13,068
So it was just you in there, alone?

118
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:15,904
Yeah.

119
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,616
How old are you?

120
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,243
Fourteen.

121
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,244
Wow.

122
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,831
Well, I mean,
you got some balls on you, sister.

123
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,624
Thanks.

124
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,140
Nobody's gonna be comin' after you, right?

125
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,391
Like, Mom,

126
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,976
Dad,

127
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,019
boyfriend?

128
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,270
I'm an orphan,

129
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,647
and, no.

130
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,863
Everyone said the open city was crazy.

131
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,325
Like, swarms of Infected
running around everywhere.

132
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,452
Not exactly like that.

133
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,079
You know, people like to tell stories.

134
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:10,500
So, there aren't Super-Infected
that explode fungus spores on you?

135
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,336
Shit, I hope not.

136
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,423
Or ones with split-open heads
that see in the dark like bats?

137
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,687
What was that?

138
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,610
Let's keep movin'.

139
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,440
You've gotta be kidding me!

140
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,276
Ya ever stay in a place like this?

141
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,070
No, a little out of our league.

142
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,864
-How do you even know what this is?
-Have you heard of books?

143
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,202
Wait, are we going in there?

144
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,288
Yeah, we gotta get to the stairwell
on the other side.

145
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,292
Well, I don't know how to swim.

146
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,629
-Seriously?
-Do you think we have pools in the QZ?

147
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,172
No, smart ass.

148
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,173
I mean.

149
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,636
I don't know how I was supposed
to know that.

150
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,733
This is so gross.

151
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,695
Check it out!

152
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,911
Ding, ding.

153
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,914
Yes, sir. I would like your
finest suite, please.

154
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,208
Yes, ma'am.
Would you like me to take your luggage?

155
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,503
-Yes, ma'am. Right away, ma'am--
-You're a weird kid.

156
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,464
You're a weird kid.

157
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,506
Oh fuck!

158
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,762
Oh, my God.

159
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,392
Sorry.

160
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:49,785
-You okay?
-Yep. Fucking fabulous.

161
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,426
Fuck. Holy shit.

162
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,345
Come on, it wasn't that bad.

163
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,597
You try climbing ten fuckin' floors
with our knees.

164
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,224
See how ya feel.

165
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,903
Well, when the fuck did that happen?

166
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,369
Maybe that one.

167
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,622
No.

168
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,084
All right, well, I mean,
maybe I could climb up there,

169
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:42,003
work my way around,
and open it from the inside?

170
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,006
No, well, I'm the smallest,
so it'd be easier for me to get through.

171
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,343
But you die and we get nothing.
You stay.

172
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:49,970
Can you give me a hand?

173
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,158
You good up there?

174
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:16,872
Yeah, it's a bit of a mess,
so I'm gonna need a few minutes.

175
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,529
Nice knife.

176
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,537
-Where'd you learn to do that?
-The circus.

177
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,385
Where are you from?

178
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,222
Texas.

179
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,142
-What about Tess?
-Detroit. It's in Michigan.

180
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,895
I go to school. I know where Detroit is.

181
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,653
So, you two like a--

182
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,528
Pass.

183
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,907
-How'd you end up in Boston?
-Pass.

184
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,117
No more questions about me.

185
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,376
How long do Infected live?

186
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,752
I thought you went to school.

187
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,921
It's a really shitty one.

188
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:53,093
Well, some last about a month or two.

189
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,763
But there's others been walkin' around
'bout 20 years.

190
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:04,312
-Ever kill one?
-Yeah, I killed lots of 'em.

191
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,527
Was it hard?

192
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,697
Like, knowing they were people once?

193
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,743
Sometimes.

194
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,248
What about that guy last night?

195
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:31,047
You can put the gun down, Joel.

196
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,225
What now?

197
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,647
There's so many.

198
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,442
The last time we were here,
they were still deep inside the buildings.

199
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:35,070
Then I guess enough people came through
looking for the QZ,

200
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,322
they went inside seeking shelter,

201
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:41,326
and that's how they get more and more
of the city bit by bit, year after year.

202
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,880
They're connected.

203
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,216
More than you know.

204
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,094
The fungus also grows underground.

205
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,889
Long fibers like wires,
some of them stretching over a mile.

206
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,809
Now, you step on a patch
of cordyceps in one place,

207
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:09,521
and you can wake a dozen Infected
from somewhere else.

208
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,690
Now they know where you are,
now they come.

209
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,111
You're not immune from being ripped apart.

210
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,321
You understand?

211
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,116
It's important.

212
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,535
I'm tryin' to keep you alive.

213
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,502
So we're not goin' that way.

214
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:34,712
No.

215
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,799
What do we do then?

216
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,635
Short way?

217
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:45,557
Museum.

218
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,997
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

219
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:12,208
Well, there's a way
across from the top floor.

220
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,710
Well, then I guess it's fine.

221
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,004
-We used to take it all the time.
-Okay.

222
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,506
-Look, it was fine.
-Awesome.

223
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,894
It's bone dry.

224
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,938
It could mean they're
all finally dead in there.

225
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,778
Oh, man.

226
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,073
Marlene pack you one of these

227
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,700
-or just sandwiches?
-Yeah.

228
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,954
Okay, so, more ground rules.

229
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,623
We're gonna go slowly.

230
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,374
If we come up against anything,
you get behind us

231
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,168
and ya stay there, okay?

232
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,169
Yes.

233
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,342
I have a spare hand.

234
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,385
Congratulations.

235
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,914
THE BOSTONIAN MUSEUM
WELCOME

236
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:43,299
EXIT

237
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,060
GIFT SHOP OPEN
WELCOME

238
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,109
Yeah, cooked.

239
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,695
Finally, some fuckin' luck.

240
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,073
I guess we should've gone
this way in the first place.

241
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,784
Oh shit!

242
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,916
What the fuck did that?

243
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,590
Maybe,

244
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,344
maybe he was attacked outside,
and crawled through the doors.

245
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,972
The door was open.
Could've been him.

246
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,851
-I don't hear anything.
-Who would you hear?

247
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,730
Who would you hear?

248
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,982
Are you saying an Infected did that?

249
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,944
Because I've been attacked by one
and it wasn't like that.

250
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:51,075
Okay, from this point forward,
we are silent.

251
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,244
Not quiet. Silent.

252
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:57,081
-What--
-No. No questions. Just do it.

253
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,302
INDEPENDENCE HALL

254
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:31,546
They can't see, but they can hear.

255
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,749
Run!

256
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,392
Run, run!

257
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,018
-You all right?
-Twisted ankle, but, yeah.

258
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,689
You all right?

259
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,317
Well, I didn't shit my pants, so.

260
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,113
You fucking kidding me?

261
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,868
I mean, if it was gonna
happen to one of us.

262
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,622
Hey,

263
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,457
let's get the fuck outta here.

264
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,311
-Put this around your arm.
-Thanks.

265
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,275
-Over there?
-Yeah, I know. It looks scary.

266
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,278
That was scary. This is wood.

267
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,700
Just wait there. Give us a minute.

268
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,463
There's probably more ahead.

269
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,174
So, we'll deal with it then.

270
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,885
I got it. I got it.

271
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,558
What about the kid?

272
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,643
I mean, maybe the first bite didn't take,

273
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:40,312
-but what about the second?
-How 'bout you just take the good news?

274
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,773
Can you do that?

275
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,402
Like to think, for once,
maybe we could actually win?

276
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,447
Just go, go and watch her.

277
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,891
Is it everything you hoped for?

278
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,727
Jury's still out.

279
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,481
But, man, you can't deny that view.

280
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,324
C'mon, let's get there before it's dark.

281
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,028
Where the fuck are they?

282
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,070
Stay back.

283
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,354
Joel?

284
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,357
-What the fuck is going on?
-I don't know.

285
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,405
They went inside.

286
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,370
-Come on.
-Tess.

287
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:25,537
Come on!

288
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,747
Tess!

289
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,797
EXIT

290
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,718
Holy shit.

291
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,472
Jesus.

292
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,066
Okay.

293
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:58,112
I mean, there's gotta be
a fuckin' radio or somethin', right?

294
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,658
Who killed them? FEDRA?

295
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,785
No.

296
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,872
One of them got bit.

297
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,916
The healthy ones fought the sick ones.
Everyone lost.

298
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,544
Tess? What're you doin'?

299
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:16,713
Where did Marlene say
that she was taking you?

300
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,258
-Ellie!
-I don't know. Just west.

301
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:20,926
Just west. Fuck. Okay.

302
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:24,888
Well, I mean, one of them's gotta have
a map on them, right?

303
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,099
-Joel, can ya help me?
-No!

304
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,768
Tess, it's over.

305
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:33,647
-We are going home.
-That's not my fucking home!

306
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,621
I'm stayin'.

307
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:55,127
I mean, our luck had to run out
sooner or later.

308
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,172
Fuck.

309
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,674
She's infected.

310
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:09,975
Show me.

311
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,020
Joel.

312
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,160
Oops, right?

313
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,794
Take your bandage off.

314
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,468
Look.

315
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,261
Joel?

316
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,556
This is real.

317
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,642
Joel, she's fucking real.

318
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,563
I need you to get her
to Bill and Frank's.

319
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,106
-No.
-They'll take her off your hands.

320
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,483
-No.
-They'll handle it from here.

321
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:00,776
No, no, no, I can't. They won't take her.

322
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,111
-They're not gonna take her.
-They will 'cause you'll convince them.

323
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,321
Yes, you will.

324
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,240
I never ask you for anything,

325
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,866
-not to feel the way I felt.
-No.

326
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,701
Shut the fuck up 'cause I don't have time.

327
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,870
This is your chance.

328
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,414
You get her there,

329
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,667
you keep her alive,

330
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,587
and you set everything right.

331
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,050
All the shit we did.

332
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,928
Please say yes, Joel, please.

333
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:29,930
Oh fuck!

334
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,023
-How many?
-All of them.

335
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,107
Maybe a minute.

336
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,081
-What are you doing?
-Making sure that they don't follow you.

337
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:53,055
Joel.

338
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,935
Save who you can save.

339
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:08,445
No!

340
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,989
We're not leaving her!

341
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,741
Get off me, you fucker!

342
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,284
I'm not going with you!
