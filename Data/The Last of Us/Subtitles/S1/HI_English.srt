Our doctor...

295
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,000
he thinks that the
Cordyceps in Ellie has grown

296
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,961
- with her since birth.
- Why is she in surgery?

297
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,630
It produces a kind of
chemical messenger.

298
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:53,968
It makes normal Cordyceps think that
she's Cordyceps. It's why she's immune.

299
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,678
He's gonna remove it from her,

301
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,849

chemical messengers...

and then we can
give it to everyone.

303
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,813

be a cure, Joel.

00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,837

didn't cause her any fear,

- No. No, you take me to her.
