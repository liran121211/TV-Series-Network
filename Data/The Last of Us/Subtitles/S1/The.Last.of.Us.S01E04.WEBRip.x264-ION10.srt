1
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,126
Pew, pew.

2
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,420
Pew.

3
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,673
We have to do this every hour?

4
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,341
Gas breaks down over time.

5
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,968
This stuff's almost water.

6
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,680
Back in the day,
we'd drive 10, 12 hours on one tank.

7
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,308
-You could go anywhere.
-So where'd you go?

8
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,894
Pretty much nowhere.

9
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,899
Nice! How does that work?

10
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,317
It's a siphon.

11
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,488
It's when liquid
travels against gravity

12
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,073
-because pressure--
-You don't know.

13
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,950
I know it works.

14
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,368
No wandering.

15
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,754
Okay.

16
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,924
This is your fault then.

17
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,722
"It doesn't matter how much you push
the envelope,

18
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,933
it'll still be stationery."

19
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,810
"No Pun Intended,

20
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,979
Volume Too" by Will Livingston.

21
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,440
"Volume Too." Look. You get it?

22
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,108
-"Too"? Like, T-o-o.
-Jesus.

23
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:57,403
"What did the mermaid
wear to her math class?"

24
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,076
"An algae bra."

25
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,954
Like, algae bra.

26
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,665
-"I stayed up all night--
-No.

27
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,833
"wondering where the sun went,

28
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,460
and then it dawned on me."

29
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,338
-Feel free to wait in the truck.
-Okay,

30
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,716
but just know,
you can't escape Will Livingston.

31
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,717
He'll be back.

32
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,178
There's nothing you can do to stop him.

33
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,152
Must've been some truck.

34
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,904
Yeah, they used to stick
big-ass plows on them,

35
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,031
and clear the roads
for their tanks and such.

36
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,783
I wanna see a tank.

37
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:44,993
You will.

38
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,579
Tanks, choppers, all that stuff.

39
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,624
But they'll fight the wrong enemy.

40
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,459
Just scattered around now.

41
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,755
I got somethin'.

42
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,591
Here.
This make you all nostalgic?

43
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,721
This is actually before my time.

44
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,724
-Great.
-It's a winner, though.

45
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,524
Oh, man.

46
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,193
Got somethin' else.

47
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,573
It's light on the reading,

48
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,868
-but it has some interesting pictures.
-No, no, no. Put that back.

49
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,827
That's not for kids. Ellie.

50
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,495
How would he even walk around
with that thing?

51
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,247
-Please get rid of it.
-Hold your horses.

52
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,166
I wanna see what all the fuss is about.

53
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,755
Why are all these pages stuck together?

54
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,258
The--

55
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,177
I’m just fuckin' with ya.

56
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,307
Bye-bye, dude!

57
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,420
All right.
That's enough for today.

58
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:46,382
-Slow down.
-This is slow.

59
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,135
What am I even eating?

60
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,013
That is 20-year-old
Chef Boyardee ravioli.

61
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,473
-That guy was good.
-I actually agree.

62
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,939
How long we staying out here?

63
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,774
I figure I sleep tonight,

64
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,319
and drive tomorrow all day, all night,

65
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,279
get us to Wyoming by next mornin'.

66
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,072
So can we start a fire?
I'm freezing.

67
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,741
Now, why am I gonna tell you no?

68
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,826
Because Infected will see the smoke.

69
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,828
No. Fungus isn't that smart.

70
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,623
This is too remote for Infected, anyway.

71
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,209
People?

72
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,214
So what are they gonna do?
Rob us?

73
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,132
They'll have
way more in mind than that.

74
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:32,887
Okay.

75
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,106
Actually smells kinda good.

76
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,943
Well, that would be Frank's then.

77
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,070
Joel.

78
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,160
-Joel.
-What?

79
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,789
-Can I ask you a serious question?
-Yeah.

80
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:49,714
"Why did the scarecrow get an award?"

81
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,972
Because he was outstanding in his field.

82
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,516
You dick!

83
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,518
-Did you read this?
-No.

84
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,895
Now go to sleep.

85
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,961
Those people you said,

86
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,215
there's no way anyone
knows we're here, right?

87
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,010
No one's gonna find us.

88
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,389
No one's gonna find us.

89
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:47,813
Okay.

90
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,421
-What the fuck is that?
-You don't like coffee?

91
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,733
Is that seriously what those Starbucks
in the QZ used to sell?

92
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,987
Well, theirs was a lot fresher
than what Bill saved up,

93
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,989
but, yeah, this is what they sold.

94
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,784
Smells like burnt shit.

95
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,500
Eyes on the map.

96
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,881
76 west and then,

97
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,801
70 west for, like, ever.

98
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,095
Where in Wyoming
did you say your brother was?

99
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,599
Last contact came through a radio tower
close to Cody.

100
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,933
Cody.

101
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,854
Cody, Cody. Ah, man.
That is deep up in there.

102
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,856
-Yeah.
-And if he's not there?

103
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,610
Then odds are he'll be near a settlement,

104
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,069
probably close to another city out there.

105
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,654
Ain't too many of 'em in Wyoming.

106
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,864
Chee-Yen.

107
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,366
-Cheyenne.
-Che-- really?

108
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,620
Cheyenne, Laramie,

109
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,788
Casper?

110
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,540
What's his name?

111
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,542
-Whose name?
-Your brother.

112
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,211
-Tommy.
-Younger or older?

113
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,254
-Younger.
-Why isn't he with you?

114
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,715
-A long story.
-Is it longer than 25 hours?

115
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,509
'Cause I think that's what we got.

116
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,477
Tommy's what we used to call a "joiner."

117
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,687
Dreams of becomin' a hero.

118
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,440
So he enlisted in the Army
right outta high school.

119
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,318
A few months later,
they ship him off to Desert Storm.

120
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,238
It's what they called that war.
It doesn't matter.

121
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:46,408
Point is, bein' in the Army
didn't make him feel much like a hero.

122
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,119
Cut to 12 years later, outbreak happens.

123
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,039
He convinces me to join a group
makin' their way up to Boston,

124
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,583
which I did,
mostly to keep an eye on him,

125
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,001
keep him alive.

126
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,754
It's where we met Tess.

127
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,341
And that whole crew, we--

128
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,929
Well, for what it was, it worked.

129
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,932
And then Tommy meets Marlene.

130
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,936
She talks him into joinin' the Fireflies.

131
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,939
Same mistake he made when he was 18.

132
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,734
Wants to save the world.

133
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,780
Pipe dream.
Him, Fireflies, all of 'em,

134
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,366
delusional.

135
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,619
'Course, last I heard,
he quit the Fireflies, too.

136
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,164
So now he's on his own out there and

137
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,710
I gotta go get him.

138
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,508
If you don't think
there's hope for the world,

139
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,051
why bother going on?

140
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,305
I mean, you gotta try, right?

141
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,683
You haven't seen the world,
so you don't know.

142
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,855
You keep goin' for family.

143
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,608
-That's about it.
-I'm not family.

144
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,567
No,

145
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,777
you're cargo.

146
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,321
And I made a promise to Tess.

147
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,574
And she was like family.

148
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,455
-What if you don't find him?
-I will.

149
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,206
-How do you know?
-I’m persistent.

150
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,629
Ya got up pretty early.
If you wanna grab more sleep--

151
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,339
I'm not even tired.

152
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,707
Stay put.

153
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,938
-Where are we?
-Kansas City.

154
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,192
How far back do we have to go
to get around this?

155
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:18,871
Screw it.

156
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,540
What are you doing?

157
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,543
We can jog right around this tunnel...

158
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,004
take the next ramp...

159
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,339
and we're back on the road.
Minute tops.

160
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,860
Where the fuck is the highway?

161
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,445
I can't tell from this.
I'm all turned around.

162
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,821
Don't look at the state map.

163
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,782
-Look at the inset.
-I don't know where we are in that either!

164
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,992
This is my second day
in a fucking car, man.

165
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,120
I think we're heading north?

166
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,922
It's gotta be the right.

167
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:12,466
What the fuck?

168
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,592
Stop!

169
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,887
Is that the QZ?

170
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,599
Where the fuck is FEDRA?

171
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,644
Hey!

172
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,604
Please help!

173
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,690
Put your seatbelt on.

174
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,819
-Aren't we gonna help him?
-No.

175
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,238
Fuck!

176
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,073
-Go, go, go!
-Joel!

177
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,208
Fuck.

178
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,842
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

179
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,134
-You're not hurt? Nothin'?
-I don't think so.

180
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,555
Belts off. Fast!

181
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:11,316
Let's see you, motherfucker!

182
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,947
Give us your shit,
you make it through this!

183
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,156
I promise!

184
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,868
Hey, you see that hole?

185
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,828
Can you squeeze through?

186
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,125
Last chance!

187
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,127
When I say go, you crawl to that wall,

188
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,587
and you squeeze through
and you don't come out

189
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,338
until I say, okay?

190
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,970
And they're not gonna hit you.
Look at me!

191
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,680
They're not gonna hit you.

192
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,766
You stay down, you stay low,
you stay quiet.

193
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,145
-Okay.
-Okay.

194
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,231
Go!

195
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,293
Fuck!

196
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,339
You motherfucker!

197
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,976
Now you're gonna fuckin' pay!

198
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,227
What you fuckin' did,

199
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,229
you fuckin' killed yourself, motherfucker!

200
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,434
No, no, no, no, no! It's okay. It's okay.

201
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,019
It's over. We're not fighting anymore.

202
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,938
I'm gonna go home.
I'll tell everyone you're good.

203
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,608
I don't know what to do.

204
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,068
My legs don't work.

205
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,197
My mom isn't far,
if you could get me to her.

206
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,078
We could trade with you guys.

207
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,289
We could be friends. I didn't know.

208
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,332
I'm Bryan. I'm Bryan.

209
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,584
What's your name?

210
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,478
Wait, wait, wait.

211
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,443
You can have it.
It's a good knife.

212
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,407
Get back behind the wall.

213
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,950
No, no, no, no!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

214
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,702
Please, please.
We could just talk.

215
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,037
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

216
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,080
Please, please.
No, no, no! Please!

217
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,707
No, please! Please! I'm sorry!

218
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,292
I'm sorry! Please!

219
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,628
You don't have to!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

220
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,630
Please! No, no, no!
We can just talk!

221
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,424
We can just talk!
Mom! Mom! Mom!

222
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,308
Ellie, I gotta get in there.
I can't fit through.

223
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,563
-There's some stuff against the door.
-Well, can you move it?

224
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,530
-Let's go. Fast.
-Right.

225
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,579
I’m okay. I'm good.

226
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,998
I got some food in here still,

227
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,543
and I got your light still.

228
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,254
What now?

229
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,881
-We go up.
-To get a better look?

230
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,758
Hopefully, we spot a clear route out.

231
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,848
Stay close.

232
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,224
Got it.

233
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,331
Bryan!

234
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:19,958
Bryan!

235
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,045
Body, body!

236
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,005
They got fuckin' Bryan!

237
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,857
I told you. I was alone.

238
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,277
I haven't seen any of those people
since that night.

239
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,864
What else do you want me to say?

240
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,491
I don't know. The truth?

241
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,370
Kathleen.

242
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:02,751
The Bergquists? No?

243
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,587
Mark Anthony Halpin.

244
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,049
Carrie Schreiber.
You haven't seen them?

245
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,011
The Chans? Henry Burrell.

246
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:17,849
Okay.

247
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,187
You know where Henry is.

248
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,900
Lawyer.

249
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,569
Medical attention.

250
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,697
Family visit.

251
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,456
I wonder if this is the cell,

252
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,209
where my brother was beaten to death.

253
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,877
You were wronged.

254
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,298
And I'm sorry.

255
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,843
But this has gone too far.

256
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,846
It has to stop.

257
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,225
It has to stop now, you mean?

258
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,894
Now that you're in the cell.

259
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,940
But before, people dying was okay.

260
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:10,443
When you were safe and protected,
and ratting on your neighbors to FEDRA.

261
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,445
They put a gun to my head.

262
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,489
There.

263
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,994
Have I satisfied the necessary conditions
for you to talk?

264
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,829
Kathleen, for God's sake.

265
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,875
I delivered you.

266
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,630
I held you in my hands.

267
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,429
I never told them
anything about your brother.

268
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,973
But Henry did.

269
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,644
And we know that he's still in the city.

270
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,856
And I think that you know that, too.

271
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,448
Where is he?

272
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,455
You think I won't do it?

273
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,966
I'm your doctor.

274
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,701
Who did this?

275
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,411
We think it was outsiders.

276
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,246
We found a truck, loaded.

277
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,749
It's not a FEDRA vehicle,
but they were heavily supplied.

278
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,250
Could be mercs.

279
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,588
Well, if Henry has a radio,
maybe he found someone out there.

280
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,633
Maybe he called these guys in.

281
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,346
Will he live?

282
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,520
What if I had a doctor?

283
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,356
There's no chance.
I'm sorry.

284
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,165
Open it.

285
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,303
This is Henry's work.

286
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,514
Understand?

287
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,308
And he won't stop until we stop him.

288
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,769
Find who did this.

289
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,939
Find every collaborator

290
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,941
and kill them all.

291
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,060
They're not FEDRA,
and they're not Fireflies,

292
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,770
so who are they?

293
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:33,980
People.

294
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,816
Are we okay in here?

295
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,319
For a little bit, maybe.

296
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,697
Looks like they're checkin' out
apartment buildings first.

297
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:47,327
But they'll be coming through
these places soon enough.

298
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,424
There's a really tall building
four blocks away.

299
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,510
-Yeah. Saw it.
-So that's the one?

300
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,970
As soon as we don't hear a truck, we move.

301
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,515
Fast as we can.

302
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,114
Are you okay?

303
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,620
I'm all right.

304
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,457
Are you all right?

305
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,458
Yeah.

306
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:48,513
Thing is,
is I didn't hear that guy comin',

307
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,722
and

308
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:52,392
you shouldn't have had to

309
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,436
you know?

310
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,272
Well, you're glad I did, right?

311
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,275
You're just a kid.

312
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,571
You shouldn't know what it means to--

313
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,992
It's not like you killed him.

314
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,327
But...

315
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,705
shootin' or--

316
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,792
I know what it's like

317
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,336
first time that you hurt

318
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,839
someone like that.

319
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,010
If you

320
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,727
-I'm not good at this.
-Yeah, you really aren't.

321
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,854
I mean, it was my fault.

322
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,480
You shouldn't have had to.

323
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,068
And I'm sorry.

324
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,924
It wasn't my first time.

325
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,531
Show me your grip.

326
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,202
Finger off the trigger.

327
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,664
-Now, who taught you that?
-FEDRA school.

328
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,665
Figures.

329
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,167
Your thumb

330
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,252
over your thumb.

331
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:46,923
Left hand,
squeezes down on the right.

332
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,008
You got it?

333
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:50,843
There ya go.

334
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,221
Look it.

335
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,771
Okay?

336
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,209
You put it in your pack.

337
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,504
You'll shoot your damn ass off.

338
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,206
We'll get through this.

339
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,959
I know.

340
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,393
No sign of them. You?

341
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,520
Yeah.

342
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,946
They're out of food.

343
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,199
Henry won't let Sam starve.

344
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,577
Double the guards around our provisions.

345
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,247
-He's fucking close. I can feel it.
-Yeah.

346
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:09,917
What?

347
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,447
Fuck.

348
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,919
Fuck, fuck.

349
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,053
When do we tell the others?

350
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,348
Not yet.

351
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,935
Let's just handle what we have to handle.

352
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,645
-We can deal with this after.
-Kathleen--

353
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:11,854
After.

354
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,899
Seal off the building for now.

355
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:17,610
Okay?

356
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,695
Yeah.

357
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,706
You're just gonna put your foot here.

358
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,458
One, two--

359
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:35,378
-Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.
-Straighten up. I got you.

360
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,094
-Okay, I'm in.
-Take a look around first.

361
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,512
Ellie.

362
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,138
Goddamnit.

363
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,059
Where would you be without me, huh?

364
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,270
-By now, Wyoming.
-Oh, yeah.

365
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,730
Walked into that one.

366
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,493
We'll make our way up,
and come morning,

367
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,162
I'll take a look at the city
and find our way out.

368
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,669
We're goin' up 42 flights?

369
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,379
Forty-five.

370
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:25,344
But no, not all the way.

371
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,762
How far?

372
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,515
As far as I can make it.

373
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,170
Hey, you know that guy
who said he was hurt?

374
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,047
How did you know it was an ambush?

375
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,969
I've been on both sides.

376
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,223
It was a long time ago.
We did what we needed to survive.

377
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,433
You and Tess?

378
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,019
And the people we were with.

379
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,814
My brother, too.

380
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,071
Did you kill innocent people?

381
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,748
C'mon.

382
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,257
Holy shit.

383
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:51,472
-Yeah.
-Thirty-three floors. That's good.

384
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,808
It's gonna have to be.

385
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,314
-Come on.
-Gimme a minute.

386
00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:01,899
Get up, you lazy ass.

387
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,947
Lazy ass.

388
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,366
Fifty-six years old, you little shit.

389
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:28,509
Joel?

390
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:31,804
Joel.

391
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,431
Joel.

392
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,101
-What?
-What are you doing?

393
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:40,479
I don't want someone sneakin' up on us
while we're sleepin'.

394
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,733
I get it.
Crunch, crunch, crunch.

395
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,026
Are you sure you're gonna hear it?

396
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,987
Of course, I'll hear it.
That's the damn point.

397
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,988
Okay.

398
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,365
Well, good night.

399
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,953
Yeah, good night.

400
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,560
-Hey.
-Yeah?

401
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,272
When we were talkin' about hurtin' people

402
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,318
what did you mean
it wasn't your first time?

403
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,283
I don’t wanna talk about it.

404
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,996
All right.

405
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,839
You don't have to.

406
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,133
I'm just sayin'

407
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,640
it isn't fair, your age

408
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,726
havin' to deal with all of this--

409
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,564
So it gets easier when you get older?

410
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,028
No, not really.

411
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,781
But still.

412
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,414
The reason I asked
whether you'd hear the glass or not

413
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,334
is 'cause I've noticed you don't hear
too well from your right side.

414
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,920
Is it 'cause you were shot there?

415
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,589
Probably more from shootin'.

416
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,592
So if you wanna keep your hearin',
you stick to that knife.

417
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,936
Joel?

418
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,524
Did you know diarrhea is hereditary?

419
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,193
-What?
-Yeah.

420
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,737
It runs in your jeans.

421
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,038
Jesus.

422
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,460
That is so goddamn stupid.

423
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,504
-You laughed, motherfucker.
-I didn't laugh.

424
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:12,798
-Yes, you did.
-Jesus, I'm losin' it.

425
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,717
You're losin' it big time.

426
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:33,527
-Go to sleep.
-You go to sleep.

427
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:46,999
Joel?

428
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,168
Joel!
