Miles is Dad's twin, but opposite from Dad in every way - he's a super cool jazz musician with a crazy big head of hair. When it's revealed that Miles is actually younger than Dad by 5 minutes, Alex really identifies with him and starts talking like him and dressing like him. Meanwhile, at rehearsal, Thomas suggests a \"Battle of the Brothers\" contest to clear up once and for all whether the big or little brothers are coolest. When Miles reveals his true colors by hitting on Dad's girlfriend, Betty, Alex realizes that he doesn't really want to be like Uncle Miles, he'd rather be nice to his brother.\u2014Anonymous"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1211139", "rating": 7.1, "votes": 12, "number_of_episodes": 42}
