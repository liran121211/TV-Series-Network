Whilst everybody else is arguing as to why they should have a parachute Jack leaps out of the plane with one chute for himself and the other for the drinks trolley. There is however one way to avert the crash and it is down to Ted, using one of the cheap souvenirs he bought at the pilgrimage, to put it into action and save the plane.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0578508", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 645, "number_of_episodes": 25}
