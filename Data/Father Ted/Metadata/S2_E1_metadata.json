Throughout the stay Ted keeps accidentally barging in on a young couple in their intimate moments, and, when he and Dougal decide to leave the site the husband, wearing only a towel which blows away, jumps on their bonnet and eventually slashes their tyres. They are forced to hitch back home but manage to flag down the slurry lorry - with very messy results.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0578512", "rating": 8.6, "votes": 763, "number_of_episodes": 25}
