Ted and Dougal dutifully begin their somewhat half-hearted protest but it only serves to whip up enormous publicity for the film with people from all over Europe turning up to see it. An outraged Bishop Brennan is about to send the priests off to very far-flung parishes as a punishment - until Jack discovers a highly incriminating video of him with his mistress.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0578522", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 774, "number_of_episodes": 25}
