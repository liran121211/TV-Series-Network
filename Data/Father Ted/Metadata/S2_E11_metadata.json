Returning home just before Christmas he finds that Father Todd Unctuous, who claims to be an old friend of his but whom he cannot remember, has come to stay but he turns out to be a burglar and is only prevented from stealing Ted's award when Dougal sneaks downstairs in the night to watch a scary film.
