Unfortunately the song proves to anything but obscure and very well-known so in desperation he reverts to 'My Lovely Horse'. Up against Dick Byrne's superior offering Ted's song is chosen, solely because the organizers want to lose to avoid staging the next year's costly show. At the song contest it gets 'Nil points' all round.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0578517", "rating": 8.6, "votes": 751, "number_of_episodes": 25}
