Eventually Ted gets Brennan to visit by telling him that his likeness has miraculously appeared in the skirting board and the bishop arrives, accompanied by sarcastic Father Jessup, whom Jack locks in his underpants hamper. Ted goes through with the forfeit, which puts Brennan in a catatonic state, from which he only recovers whilst visiting the Pope. He returns to Craggy Island and Ted almost convinces him that it did not happen - until the bishop sees the photograph and takes his revenge.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0578513", "rating": 8.9, "votes": 780, "number_of_episodes": 25}
