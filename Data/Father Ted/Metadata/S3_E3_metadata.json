As a result Pat gets sacked and Dougal takes on the delivery route, as the manager trusts a man of God. A vengeful Mustard has attached a bomb to the milk float which will activate at four miles an hour and detonate if the speed then falls below four. Ted manages to save Dougal thanks to a decorative brick that Mrs Doyle has brought into the house and Pat Mustard ends up literally - and fatally - hoisted by his own petard.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0578518", "rating": 9.1, "votes": 979, "number_of_episodes": 25}
