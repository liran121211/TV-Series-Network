1
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:11,644
All right, listen up.

2
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,181
Here's a map of the area.

3
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:15,114
Our 44orum brethren are
setting up a perimeter

4
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,251
outside the hotel as we speak.

5
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,654
May even send some guys in
to scope the inside.

6
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:22,268
We'll make sure
those mutants stay put

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,767
until they get
what's coming to them.

8
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,659
Then we'll flush 'em back
to the freak show

9
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:27,027
where they belong.

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,199
You good, Shane?

11
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:33,267
You've been mighty quiet
this whole time.

12
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,437
Not afraid to go toe-to-toe
with these creatures, are you?

13
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:40,674
Damn!

14
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:42,276
It's always the quiet ones.

15
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:44,611
It's game time, boys!

16
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:45,846
Let's make 'em pay!

17
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,048
Run 'em out of town. Yeah!

18
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:51,018
Let's clean up the
Motor City! Yeah.

19
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,693
Okay, you can come out.

20
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:01,995
Look, it's safer down here
than in one of those rooms.

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,165
Seriously, Manny,
it's safe down here.

22
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:06,800
Only a handful of people
know about this place, and...

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,502
we can trust them.

24
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,225
Don't think I'm ever
gonna get used to that.

25
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,511
Man.

26
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:20,414
I can't believe you're
back here in the flesh.

27
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:21,915
Well, kind of.

28
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,252
Was starting to think
I'd never see you again.

29
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:27,655
I would never let that happen.

30
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:34,928
So...

31
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:36,062
tell me everything.

32
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:37,365
What happened to you?

33
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:41,735
I arrived at Belle Isle
just like the other 4,400,

34
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:44,272
confused and terrified.

35
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:46,383
Then I discovered that
I could make myself invisible,

36
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,342
which freaked me out at first.

37
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,278
Then...

38
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,331
I realized that I could hide
from the government.

39
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:53,614
When they did their counts,

40
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,015
I stayed off their radar.

41
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,517
Damn.

42
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,952
But why didn't you tell me
you were here?

43
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,622
I mean, why the-the clocks,
the cyphers? I...

44
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,458
You were a part-time Fed, Jha.

45
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,002
I needed to make sure
that I could trust you,

46
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,386
that you knew me enough
to find me.

47
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,463
What the hell, Manny?

48
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:12,766
I mean, your tests
almost drove me insane.

49
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,570
Government's been after me
since before I got taken.

50
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,240
Now that I'm back, they
definitely see me as a threat.

51
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:20,684
And trust me,
they're not gonna do anything

52
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,110
to protect the folks
in this sanctuary

53
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:24,812
from the actual threat
that's coming.

54
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:27,715
There's this 44orum online,

55
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,251
people spreading hate
and misinformation.

56
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:32,653
Yeah, I read about
those asshats.

57
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,298
You think they're actually
planning something?

58
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:36,390
Yes, I do.

59
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,626
And with the government
rounding us up

60
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,595
from the tip line,
we got to convince any 4,400

61
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:44,064
that's still out there
to come back here, ASAP.

62
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,300
We're stronger

63
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:47,935
if we're all here together.

64
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,239
Okay, but...

65
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:52,740
but what about you, huh?

66
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,675
How are you?

67
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,577
You okay?

68
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,347
Look, I'm worried
about all of y'all,

69
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,015
but... you,

70
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,584
you good?

71
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,821
I'm good.

72
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:10,123
I just want to make sure
we're all safe.

73
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,232
We don't know much about them,
but things seem promising.

74
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:17,865
This BHN company is sending
food and other supplies.

75
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:21,335
They're letting us handle the
day-to-day running of the hotel.

76
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:22,936
Maybe they're legit.

77
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,205
Well, from what I found
from some Internet sleuthing,

78
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,775
Sienna Stone is
the founder and CEO.

79
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,444
She's some renegade,
anti-government

80
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,446
tech entrepreneur dedicated

81
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,682
to building sustainable
communities.

82
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:38,386
So maybe their heart's
in the right place,

83
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,020
unlike the government.

84
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,490
Reverend Johnston.

85
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:43,857
Ji-Eun.

86
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,058
You're all right.

87
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,495
Yes, I am.

88
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,773
I thought you'd take your
chances anywhere else but here.

89
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:50,864
I'm sorry about that.

90
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:52,466
I just got freaked out.

91
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,368
I'm just glad I was there
to rescue her

92
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,737
from that jerk that called her
into the tip line.

93
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:59,973
So, you and your friend

94
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,742
would like to seek sanctuary?

95
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,244
Not exactly.

96
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,681
I heard a rumor you could
take away powers.

97
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,218
Well, I...

98
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:15,823
Sometimes, I glow
without even knowing it.

99
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,858
Harold and I want to live
a normal life

100
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,226
together.

101
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:23,263
I want you to take
my powers away,

102
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:25,733
and I want you to marry us.

103
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:30,070
We know what it looks like.

104
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,840
Ji-Eun and I were together
when she went missing,

105
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,676
but I never gave up hope.

106
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,512
I knew one day I'd find her.

107
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,848
And here we are
over 30 years later.

108
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,250
Time couldn't stop our love.

109
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:45,786
Your story is proof
that God looks out

110
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,389
for true love and hope.

111
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,290
I would be honored
to officiate your wedding

112
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:53,093
and relieve you of your powers
if you're sure.

113
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,596
Yes, I am. Thank you.

114
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,465
There's so much to do.

115
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:00,100
I don't
even know where to start.

116
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,804
Could you help me
with everything?

117
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,406
Since you've been married
before?

118
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,414
Mr. Davis.

119
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,315
There's someone here
that say they know you.

120
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,891
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

121
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,427
I've never seen this man before.

122
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,229
Oh, my word!

123
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,464
Gotcha. Sherlock.

124
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:32,332
Watson.

125
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:35,903
Ah, I'm so pleased it's you
and not one of those people.

126
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,839
Have you heard of this 44orum?

127
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,772
The patriotic nuts
who believe things about us

128
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,610
that break my brain?

129
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,177
Yeah. Indeed.

130
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:48,015
There are rumors that
some of them are posing

131
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,350
as 4,400 seeking sanctuary

132
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,285
in order to infiltrate
the hotel,

133
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,587
which is why we have

134
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,856
guard shifts
to provide security now.

135
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,958
It's not a rumor. It's true.

136
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,327
We have to be careful in here.

137
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:01,795
Okay? They are coming for us.

138
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:02,796
How do you know this?

139
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,598
Are you...

140
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,933
all right?

141
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,103
Yeah. Yeah. Just...

142
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,039
glad to be back.

143
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:15,342
I'm so pleased to see you.

144
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:18,646
She's a real beauty.

145
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:21,314
Bought it from an estate sale
a few months ago.

146
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,050
But I can't seem to get my hands

147
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,352
on the original track
from the 1930s.

148
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:26,686
I could go with you next time.

149
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,722
We could find our next project.

150
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:31,034
Like that time we restored
that phonograph from the 1880s.

151
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,393
Yeah.

152
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,338
It's good to have my trusty
assistant back in the attic.

153
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,730
And up next,

154
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:39,366
the radio host you hate to love,
Kevin Wellington,

155
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,002
telling it like it is.

156
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,613
Giving you
the kick in the butt you need

157
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:44,905
to stop being one of the sheep

158
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,574
and start thinking for yourself.

159
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,175
You're listening
to that man again?

160
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,243
You've been playing him nonstop
since I got back.

161
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:53,647
What happened to
Miami's News Breakdown?

162
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,382
What do you know about
Kevin Wellington?

163
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,050
Nothing.

164
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,719
Except he's clearly
a racist radio hack

165
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,329
who's making America dumber
by the second.

166
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,833
All he does is
spin outrageous stories

167
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,425
about everyone from-from
immigrants to Black people

168
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,595
to the 4,400.

169
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,229
And right now,
I'm kind of all three.

170
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,264
Yeah, well, he keeps it real.

171
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,200
He makes some good points, too.

172
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:16,870
Oh, my God, I totally forgot.

173
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:19,439
The, uh, the Meet the 4,400
event is on.

174
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,374
You can see my friends.

175
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,279
Yeah, um, you know,

176
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:28,381
having Hayden in our home
was unexpected,

177
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:31,118
but, you know, he's brought
so much good into our lives.

178
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,854
I can't imagine him being anywhere else.
Okay, so that's Logan.

179
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,957
He's Shanice's, like, husband,
or ex or whatever.

180
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,126
All this stuff is just for show.

181
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,629
It's all fake. Daddy, it's not.
Just-just watch.

182
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,300
Oh, my God.

183
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:49,469
Up. Up in the window.

184
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,805
Up. Mildred?

185
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,908
That little white girl...

186
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,953
- Well, I'll give you a reason!
- She-She's doing this.

187
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,411
Oh, my God.

188
00:07:58,546 --> 00:07:59,689
She's trying to murder that man.

189
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,114
No, no. She...

190
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,651
No, this is who they are.

191
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:06,554
This is what they can do.

192
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,055
No, no.

193
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,723
This is what you are.

194
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,625
Something's wrong.
I got to call Andre.

195
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,995
Thanks.

196
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:25,005
What are you doing?
Can I have my phone?

197
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,740
Dad?

198
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,475
Daddy?

199
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,915
Daddy?

200
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,517
Daddy, let me out!

201
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:47,695
Okay, well,
you know I had to ask.

202
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,663
At least see
if Mildred's interested.

203
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:51,765
I mean, she is kind of wanted
by...

204
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,667
well, everyone.

205
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,269
All right, cool. Thanks.

206
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:01,541
And Claudette is...
Big shocker... a no.

207
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,176
Claudette, huh?

208
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,954
Thought you and Carla were
going to make it.

209
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:07,480
Let's just say I wasn't
exactly the best partner

210
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:08,849
after you disappeared.

211
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,517
I mean,

212
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,220
she did everything she could
to help, but I was...

213
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,487
an undeserving ass.

214
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:15,723
I'm sorry, Jha. I...

215
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,357
I'm sorry it was
so hard for you.

216
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,893
No.
Just the man I was looking for.

217
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,496
Um, hey, what's up?

218
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:25,733
Can you get a marriage license
for Ji-Eun and Harold?

219
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,735
Since it's easier
for you to come and go.

220
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,205
Yeah, sure. This is my...
I'm Jorge.

221
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,908
Jharrel and I went
to college together.

222
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,910
Don't worry,
I'm a 4,400 supporter.

223
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:38,411
Reverend Johnston.

224
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,413
Pleasure to meet you. Likewise.

225
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,754
I should go.
Jharrel, thanks for your help.

226
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,388
No problem.

227
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:52,893
So,

228
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,394
we are Jorge now?

229
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,430
I can't let word get back
to the government.

230
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,669
I'll find you later.

231
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:08,942
You okay?

232
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,444
My powers, I... Um...

233
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,714
I can't turn invisible.

234
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:14,948
Wait, w-what do you mean?

235
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,616
I mean, I can't, like...

236
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,828
I've never not been able...
I mean, since it started,

237
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,452
I've never not been able to...
It's okay.

238
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,691
All right, just hide out here
until it comes back.

239
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,558
Then dive into this.

240
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:29,129
Always calmed you down,
remember?

241
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,631
I will help you figure this out
when I get back.

242
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,639
Andre said you were back.

243
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,041
How long are you visiting?

244
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,609
I'm staying.

245
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,503
I heard you're in charge
of room assignments.

246
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,546
Feels like I am
in charge of everything

247
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,915
around here.

248
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,717
Oh, I am a diplomat.

249
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:52,585
Events coordinator, landlord.
You name it.

250
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,288
But how are you?

251
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:56,422
Where have you been?

252
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,657
I'm fine. Fine.

253
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,827
I just could really use
a shower.

254
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,829
So I was hoping I could get
my old room back.

255
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:04,231
Or, honestly, any room.
It does not matter.

256
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,166
A lot of 4,400 are coming back,

257
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,168
so you may end up
with a roommate.

258
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:09,336
That's fine.

259
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,773
Be nice to not be alone for a change.
Great.

260
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,942
That makes my job easier.

261
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,977
And what is with this wedding
y'all are throwing

262
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,445
for Ji-Eun and her boo?

263
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,923
Because when I left,
we barely had money

264
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:21,614
for decent clothes,
and now there are

265
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,516
racks of dresses
for her to try on.

266
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,252
How can we afford all this?

267
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,187
Oh, when BHN found out
about the wedding,

268
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,789
they gave us money
to pay for it.

269
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,190
Sweet.

270
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,491
Or shady?

271
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:33,961
I don't know yet.

272
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,797
Hmm. Well, if you need a DJ,
I'm your girl.

273
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,431
I might just take you up
on that.

274
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,167
Great.

275
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,601
I love weddings.

276
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,838
You know, I always thought
my dad was gonna walk me

277
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:47,374
down the aisle, but...

278
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,109
things are kind of different
now.

279
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,454
It's clear that the 4,400
have been hiding

280
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,113
their true nature
from the world.

281
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,048
What could they want from...

282
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,361
Look, you have to stop this.

283
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,853
You have to let me go.

284
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,289
I'm just waiting for
the iguana to show itself.

285
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,024
What iguana?

286
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,158
I am your daughter.

287
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:07,660
Yeah. They said you'd say that.

288
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:10,197
Who? Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

289
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,000
I know that you
and the rest of the 4,400

290
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,301
trick innocent people.

291
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,237
I read all about it
on the 44orum.

292
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,139
You manipulated me,

293
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,075
claiming to be my daughter.

294
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,543
Kevin Wellington was right.

295
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,813
The 4,400 are just posing

296
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:28,481
as long-lost family members
and then killing them.

297
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,418
No, that's not what...
How can I...

298
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,027
Remember when you took
me and Mom to the botanicals

299
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,694
when I was eight?

300
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:43,730
And I gave Mom
a really hard time

301
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:45,933
because I wanted to wear
that white dress,

302
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,767
the one she was saving
for Easter.

303
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:50,337
And you made me wear this,

304
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,073
like, horrid bright
orange shirt.

305
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:57,945
And I was so mad, until we got
to the butterfly enclosure.

306
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,914
And then out of nowhere,

307
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:04,117
all the, all the butterflies
started flocking to my shirt

308
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,719
till I was covered
in butterflies.

309
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,389
And then I wasn't mad anymore.

310
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,562
It was the first time you
called me your little butterfly.

311
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:21,301
Not all the powers are bad.

312
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,636
And Mildred only did
what she did because...

313
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,074
they treated her horribly
at this facility, Ypsi Med.

314
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:28,741
But we're still us.

315
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,980
Look, I'm-I'm still me.

316
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,282
I'm still your little butterfly.

317
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,999
It was a nice try,

318
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,167
but I know you're not
my daughter.

319
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,835
You stole her memories somehow,

320
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,737
and you're trying to
use them against me.

321
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,173
But I know the truth,

322
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,075
and you are not human.

323
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,412
If you won't show
your true self,

324
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,347
then I'll just have to make you.

325
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,118
Dad!

326
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,157
All right, in most cases,

327
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,068
the pawn is considered
the weakest on the board.

328
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,170
But, if it reaches the other
side without being captured,

329
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,796
it can be promoted to any other
chess piece except a king.

330
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,466
Okay. Okay. Pawn promotion.
I think I got that.

331
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,268
Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty cool.

332
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,804
But good luck getting your pawn
past my defense.

333
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,141
Oh... All right.

334
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:40,147
So, wh-what happened
with the landscaping contract

335
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,315
for Hockeytown Properties?

336
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,884
I mean, Ms. Bridget said
you didn't get the job.

337
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,520
Yeah, um...

338
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,556
You know, they-they pulled out
last minute,

339
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,291
decided to go with someone else.

340
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,228
Yeah, is it because you were
on TV supporting us,

341
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:58,465
then Mildred tried
to kill Bill Greene?

342
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,900
Now she's on these posters...

343
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,970
I'm scared of
what she might do next,

344
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,172
or what she might
get others to do.

345
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:08,008
Look, either way,

346
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:11,211
I'm sorry she caused you
to lose work.

347
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,546
Maybe it had nothing to do
with Mildred.

348
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,415
It's as much a mystery to me

349
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:18,251
as chess.

350
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,055
Look, I'm just glad

351
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,524
that you decided not to go
back to that hotel.

352
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,260
It's not where I feel
like I belong anymore.

353
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:31,398
You know? But I also feel safe
here with you all.

354
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,433
That you are.

355
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,105
All right, so now
I-I can do this, yeah?

356
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,409
Okay, let's try this again.

357
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:43,676
What?

358
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,382
We can work here
undisturbed now.

359
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:53,220
I must show you
what the COBOL code found.

360
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:56,123
Apparently, the government was
looking for something called.

361
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,258
ZMT in our blood.

362
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,760
ZMT? Never heard of it.

363
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,296
Neither had I.
We'll figure out what it is.

364
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,098
Now that you're back,

365
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:07,800
I'm confident we'll solve
this mystery in no time.

366
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,141
If you wish to discuss it,

367
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:15,875
I shall listen.

368
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,149
Who's there?

369
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,289
Sorry. Sorry.

370
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,159
Uh, I didn't think anyone else
was going to come in here.

371
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,427
I'm Jorge,

372
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,464
a 4,400 friend of Jharrel's.

373
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,965
He never mentioned you.

374
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,567
You know,
I'm gonna go get Shanice,

375
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,910
and she'll let us know
if you're one of us

376
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,403
or a 44orem-er trying
to sneak in.

377
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,663
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

378
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,840
All right, the truth is

379
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:50,943
I'm Manny, Jharrel's brother.

380
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,747
I'm a 4,400 just like you.

381
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,783
The government is after me,

382
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,319
and I'm hiding here because it's
the only place that's safe.

383
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,821
W-Wait, you're,
like, Manny-Manny?

384
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,022
Jharrel must be so pleased

385
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,324
you're back.

386
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,758
Did he tell you?

387
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,460
We found the COBOL code
among your books.

388
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,296
No.

389
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,298
Then spill the tea. Yes.

390
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:12,832
What is ZMT,

391
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,845
and how is it connected
to us being zapped here?

392
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,304
I know it's in our blood,
but please tell us,

393
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:20,039
does it explain how we got here,
or why we have powers?

394
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,709
ZMT is the reason
I'm afraid for my life.

395
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,711
What does that mean?

396
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,380
The answers that
you think you want

397
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:28,881
are only gonna lead
to the deaths

398
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,217
of people that you love.

399
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,121
So, for their sake
and the sake of the other 4,400,

400
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,723
let this ZMT thing go

401
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,725
and forget you ever saw me.

402
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,999
And there are
these apps that let you

403
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:49,112
send money to people and ones
that can tell you the time

404
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:50,537
on the other side of the world.

405
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,339
Can you believe that?

406
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:57,244
Hey, stranger.

407
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,581
Glad to see you survived
your time on the inside.

408
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,183
I was worried about you.

409
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,817
Thanks.

410
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,154
But I just want to put
the whole thing behind me.

411
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:09,595
Please say that
you changed your mind

412
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:10,999
and you're gonna come stay here
in the hotel.

413
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,559
That ain't for me,
you know that.

414
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,927
But I am happy to bring Mildred
back here, though.

415
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,430
All right, fine.

416
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,999
Maybe you could mix me up
a drink sometime.

417
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,178
Show off what you learned
at that bartending convention.

418
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:25,505
I'm sure we could figure
something out.

419
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,841
All right, cool.

420
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,581
All right, what gives?

421
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,655
You are happier
than a dog with two tails,

422
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:39,786
and it can't be just
'cause you're glad to see me.

423
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:42,955
Okay. Yes.

424
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,458
It's my brother. He's back.

425
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:48,595
Well, I'll be.

426
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,072
I mean, he's all
you've been talking about,

427
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,964
not to mention
I'm staying at his place.

428
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,600
I need to thank him in person.

429
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:59,272
I promise not to bite.

430
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,494
Have you connected with anyone
from the time you left?

431
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,380
I've reached out to my son,
Quincy,

432
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,116
hoping we could find
some common ground.

433
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,651
But I haven't heard from him.

434
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,987
Whatever happens, the 4,400
are my children now.

435
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,058
That's the one who...

436
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,461
She hurt that man. Mildred?

437
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,095
What is she doing here?

438
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,565
Brother Harold, your nerves
are understandable,

439
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,768
but I can assure you,
Mildred is one of us.

440
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:35,942
Sister Mildred.

441
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:39,612
In from the cold
and fully transformed.

442
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:41,681
The guy looked really terrified.

443
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,182
Do you think it'll be okay

444
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:46,419
if I just come back?

445
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,322
Many understand how badly
the government treated us,

446
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:52,024
some worse than others.

447
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,527
I understand
what Bill Greene did to you,

448
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,463
why you did what you did.

449
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,966
Thank you for stopping me.

450
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,870
Still, I want my powers back.

451
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,538
Can you do that?

452
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,708
I'm not sure exactly
how it works yet,

453
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,209
but I'll try.

454
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:35,234
I'm sorry.

455
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,370
It's okay, I guess.

456
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,707
I know he's
Jharrel's brother, but...

457
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,709
I'm not inclined to trust
someone we just met

458
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,477
with decisions
that could affect us all.

459
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,846
I don't trust him either, but...

460
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:50,517
I don't think ZMT is what really
matters right now, Andre.

461
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,419
You don't know
what it's like out there.

462
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:55,054
The things people believe
about us, it is scary.

463
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,656
Look, that's why I'm here

464
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,558
and not with my mom.

465
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,496
You all are my family.

466
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,766
And I came here to warn you
that danger is real,

467
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,200
and it's immediate.

468
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:09,902
What happened?

469
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:11,604
In Miami?

470
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:15,408
I saw what's out there
firsthand.

471
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:18,277
I saw that anyone
can turn against you

472
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:21,381
because they've been brainwashed
by this nonsense.

473
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:22,514
What nonsense exactly?

474
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:23,850
That we're iguanas.

475
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,218
That we're imposters.

476
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:27,930
That we'll steal their souls
in the night.

477
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,422
That we'll eat their babies.

478
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:31,858
None of it is real
or makes any sense.

479
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,462
They will believe anything

480
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:37,964
that excuses
their irrational hatred of us.

481
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,866
Whatever narrative works
for them.

482
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:46,238
We're not human to them.

483
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,775
And how can we reason with them
if that's what they think?

484
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:55,415
There it is.

485
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:56,548
Wow.

486
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:57,750
It really does look like her

487
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:58,927
from the pictures
you've shown me.

488
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,319
Daddy, who is this?

489
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:03,089
Shane,
he's a vet friend of mine.

490
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:06,058
Does a lot of work
with exotic animals.

491
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,404
He's gonna help me figure out
what happened to my daughter.

492
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:09,428
I am your daughter.

493
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:10,763
We both know you're not.

494
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:12,499
Oh, my God.

495
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:14,667
But you're gonna tell me
what you did with her.

496
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,068
Don't worry. We'll get

497
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,804
to the truth,
one way or the other.

498
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:26,245
Oh. Oh, boy, oh, boy. Ah!

499
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:33,486
Manny?

500
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:36,022
You can come out now.

501
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,161
Jharrel.

502
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,831
I asked you to keep
my whereabouts to yourself.

503
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:48,034
I know,
but you don't really say no

504
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,969
to Claudette.

505
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,141
I heard a lot about you.

506
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,976
It's nice to finally meet you.

507
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,512
It's nice to meet you, too.

508
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:03,983
Well, as much
as I'd love to stay,

509
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,317
I have to get going.

510
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:06,953
My shift's starting soon.

511
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,388
Okay, well, I'll catch you
after the wedding.

512
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:11,658
Yeah.

513
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,330
Would you look at that.

514
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:19,732
Yeah?

515
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,701
I guess we're both
learning a lot.

516
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:23,870
Huh, Jorge?

517
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,888
One of the greats.

518
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:43,590
It's a shame
most people nowadays

519
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:45,692
have no idea who he was.

520
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,432
I'm Jorge.

521
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:55,267
I'm not in the mood to chat.

522
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:59,606
All right, I'll be quick,
Claudette.

523
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:03,209
Don't worry.

524
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:04,511
I'm pro-4,400.

525
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,166
I heard about how you ousted
that anti-4,400 bartender

526
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:10,517
and I thought

527
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:12,351
there's more
that I could teach you.

528
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,753
Teach me?

529
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,688
You're wasting your time.

530
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,089
I don't need your help.

531
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:19,959
Revolutions of the past started

532
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:21,728
in church basements
and closed quarters.

533
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:25,632
Now we mobilize out in the open.

534
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,537
I want to level
the playing field.

535
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,038
Teach you how to use

536
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,749
modern skills of resistance
and organization.

537
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:35,441
Help you hone your powers.

538
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:36,576
No one's gonna give

539
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,444
the 4,400 their freedom,

540
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:40,146
their power.

541
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,380
You've got to take it.

542
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,286
It's what Stokely believed.

543
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:52,625
Come to one of our meetings,
see what you think.

544
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,227
If you like it,

545
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,007
you can come train with me
for a few weeks.

546
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,002
Think about it.

547
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:16,448
Claudette. Claudette, wait.

548
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:17,917
What the hell, Jorge?

549
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,852
Manny? Whoever you claim to be.

550
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:22,254
Did Jharrel see you run
out here? What does he think...

551
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,966
He got a call to come pick up
the marriage license.

552
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,858
Listen, I can explain.

553
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:27,026
Explain what?

554
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,427
That you lied to me?

555
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,938
A-And now, you're lying
to your brother,

556
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:31,339
letting him think
we've never met before.

557
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,965
Jharrel is not ready
to hear the truth.

558
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,168
Not like you. So now you
want me to lie to him, too?

559
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:37,637
Oh, you have got some nerve.

560
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,370
You have every right
to be angry with me.

561
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,232
But don't let this distract you
from the movement.

562
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:44,476
Look, I saw

563
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:46,212
the posters you put up.

564
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:50,516
Using that telekinetic girl,
that was genius.

565
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,685
That's what we need,

566
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:54,721
a rallying call,

567
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:56,288
for people to see her power.

568
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,458
She doesn't have her power
anymore. Rev took it away.

569
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,795
He can take powers away.

570
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,832
But she is still a symbol,
even without her power.

571
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:08,334
She was brave enough
to fight for our freedom.

572
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:10,803
Which is exactly why
you need to stay focused.

573
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,504
The 4,400 need you.

574
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:14,559
Even if that means
not telling Jharrel the truth.

575
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:20,713
What are you so hyped up about?

576
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:24,383
It just so happens that
I have some hot tea to sip.

577
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,252
Jharrel's brother, Manny,

578
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,688
is alive, and staying here,
in the hotel.

579
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:29,889
Manny? Mm-hmm.

580
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:31,023
But...

581
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:32,859
LaDonna and I stumbled upon him

582
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:34,393
in the cocktail lounge earlier.

583
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:37,196
And get this, he's a 4,400, too.

584
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,832
Wow.

585
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,168
Well, Jharrel must be thrilled
to have him back.

586
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:45,337
Can't wait to meet him.
Uh, does he need a room?

587
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,406
Well, I'm not sure
you'll be able

588
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,908
to meet him just yet.

589
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:52,111
His return is supposed to be
on the down low.

590
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:56,883
More wedding planning, I see.

591
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,120
Just when I think
I'm almost done,

592
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:03,622
I get another request
from the happy couple.

593
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:07,894
It must be hard,

594
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:10,963
watching this joyful reunion.

595
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,564
I'm sure it's
stirring up feelings

596
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:13,733
about your own family.

597
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:15,301
About Logan.

598
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:19,605
Well, it's not that, exactly.

599
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,211
I'm exhausted
from wedding planning

600
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:28,781
and running the hotel.

601
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:30,649
I just...

602
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,320
I don't feel
like I have a choice.

603
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,655
And sometimes I wish
I could just be free

604
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,157
of all of it, you know.

605
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,993
My-my life before seemed...

606
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:42,895
easier, you know?

607
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,967
Well, I'm here to help
with whatever you need.

608
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,002
You just say the word, okay?

609
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:54,106
Thank you, Andre. Hmm.

610
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,509
You're one of
the bright spots in all of this.

611
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:02,014
I know what might
lift your spirits.

612
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:05,484
Would you do me the honor

613
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,120
of accompanying me
to tonight's festivities?

614
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:10,156
It would make me
the luckiest man there.

615
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,191
Outside of Ji-Eun's betrothed,
of course.

616
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:18,030
I would love to.

617
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:21,600
All right, let's try this again.

618
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,940
We both know I haven't gotten
any better since last time.

619
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:26,705
Look, chess is all about
pushing your opponent

620
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,279
to a corner
without them realizing it

621
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,441
until it's too late.

622
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,343
All right.

623
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,785
What are you doing, bud?

624
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,389
Are you okay?

625
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:44,891
Yeah.

626
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,899
What in the world?

627
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:09,215
I just feel like this huge
weight has been lifted.

628
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:11,717
I can only imagine.

629
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:13,131
Is he gonna want his place back?

630
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:15,054
I don't...

631
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:16,588
know what he wants.

632
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:18,891
You know, I just want him here.

633
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:23,195
So, he told you he's a 4,400
just like us?

634
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:26,665
Yeah, I'm still trying to wrap
my brain around everything.

635
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,435
Trying to, I don't know,
be a good brother.

636
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:31,437
Trust him.

637
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:35,607
I was hard on him in the past.

638
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,613
Just be careful, okay?

639
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:45,584
W-What the 4,400 went through...

640
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,386
it changed us.

641
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:53,259
Manny may be dealing
with more than he's telling you.

642
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,366
You ready?

643
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,239
Tell me.

644
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:12,244
When a child hurts themself,

645
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:13,880
they only know they're hurt

646
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,248
because of how
the adults around them react.

647
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:18,918
Pain is learned,

648
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:21,153
and it can be unlearned.

649
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,661
If I want full control
of my powers,

650
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:32,598
I have to unlearn the pain.

651
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,235
It is the only way
to open my mind

652
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,569
to what is possible.

653
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,939
To embrace what only you can do.

654
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:43,475
Remember, the 44orum-ers are not
gonna stop coming after you.

655
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:45,344
This...

656
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:47,013
this is how you
protect yourself.

657
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,488
What do you feel?

658
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,791
Nothing.

659
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:05,331
Good.

660
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:06,865
Now it's time
to return to your life

661
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,643
and prepare the others
for the coming fight.

662
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:12,371
It's up to you to get
the word out for the 4,400.

663
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,840
Tell them to embrace
their power.

664
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:16,414
Everything else will
fall into place.

665
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:18,162
So, you're gonna tell me
who you really are?

666
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:22,514
You're way too connected to have
returned like the rest of us.

667
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:24,550
You're right.

668
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:25,985
I'm not a 4,400.

669
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:28,120
Well, then who are you?

670
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,522
And why are you so invested
in what happens to us?

671
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,291
For now, all you need to know is

672
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,892
that I'm here on
a different mission.

673
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:36,895
I'll tell you more about it,

674
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,297
when the time is right.

675
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:48,174
Thank you. You're welcome.

676
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,243
All right,
you sure you want to do this?

677
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,412
You know that Bridget,
Mariah and I want you

678
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,014
to live with us, right?

679
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:56,715
Look, it's safer for everyone.

680
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:59,585
Look, if anything happened
to any of you, I...

681
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:01,520
I wouldn't be able to live
with myself.

682
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:02,754
Hayden!

683
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:05,591
You're back!

684
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:08,360
Mildred, you're here.

685
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:09,928
Did you come for the wedding?

686
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:11,563
The wedding?

687
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:13,032
Oh, who's getting married?

688
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:14,166
Ji-Eun and Harold.

689
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:17,369
Okay, um...

690
00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:18,604
No, I, uh,

691
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,206
I'm just bringing Hayden back.

692
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,608
Well, you have to stay,
Mr. Kaminski.

693
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,110
The more, the merrier.

694
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:26,512
Yeah, please, stay.

695
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:27,852
I-If it's not too much trouble.

696
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,417
All right. I'll go move the car.

697
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:37,289
I missed you, Hay.

698
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:40,759
How are you? Tell me everything.

699
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:47,398
Come on!

700
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:50,069
Go! Yes, yeah!

701
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,415
Right there! Right there.
Put 'em up, put 'em up.

702
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:54,640
Put 'em up, put 'em up.

703
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:57,709
Yeah...! Lesbi-Pins!

704
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,644
Woo-hoo!

705
00:32:58,777 --> 00:32:59,645
Bam, put 'em up!

706
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,113
Did you see that?

707
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:03,115
I wasn't sure I was
in the right place.

708
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:04,950
Oh, I know. It's okay.

709
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,694
It's hard to believe that
I'm a cryptologist,

710
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:07,819
triple agent

711
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:10,622
and an athlete,
all in my spare time.

712
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,325
Wait, does bowling count
as a sport?

713
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:14,826
Hell yeah, it does.

714
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,795
What's wrong with you?

715
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:28,074
Called you here
'cause it was loud.

716
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:29,841
We're less likely
to be recorded,

717
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:32,144
and I'm sticking to my routine...

718
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:34,146
Less red flags that way.

719
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,783
And your schedule involves
the Lesbi-Pins?

720
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:42,354
Don't tell me you're more of a
Motor City Rollers kind of guy.

721
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:44,490
More of a Feather Bowler.

722
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:45,857
That's acceptable.

723
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,627
Hey.

724
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,429
Thank you for helping me
find my brother.

725
00:33:51,497 --> 00:33:53,532
Uh, you are an evil genius.

726
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,134
I know.

727
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,269
How are you handling
all this cloak-and-dagger?

728
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,171
I know it's got to be tough.

729
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:01,173
Yeah.

730
00:34:01,307 --> 00:34:04,543
I realized I had to do
everything I could to help.

731
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:09,148
My mom doesn't want me sticking
my neck out, but...

732
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:12,151
it's the hard decisions
that matter, right?

733
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:14,220
Amen to that.

734
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:17,055
And listen, after
what Jessica put you through,

735
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:19,725
I had to find out
what happened to Manny,

736
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,293
why he was so important,

737
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,462
why the government was hell-bent
on finding him.

738
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,202
That's 'cause he refused
to work for them.

739
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:26,365
Not exactly.

740
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:28,167
That's why I needed
to talk to you.

741
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,137
Manny's work involved
something called ZMT.

742
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:33,405
The government thinks
that it's connected

743
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:36,908
to what makes the 4,400 so...

744
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,244
unique.

745
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:40,646
Okay, w-wait.
What are you saying?

746
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,524
'Cause Manny got zapped
and appeared on Belle Isle,

747
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:43,982
like everybody else. J...

748
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,917
He's not telling you everything.

749
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:48,420
The government's looking for
Manny because they need him,

750
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:52,191
because he knows something about
how the 4,400 just showed up,

751
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:54,893
which means that he knows more

752
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:58,029
about all of this
than he's been letting on.

753
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:07,773
Ji-Eun. Harold.

754
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:10,542
Your love story is
a parable for us all.

755
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:12,110
Ji-Eun, are you ready

756
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:14,846
for me to strip you of your powers?
I am.

757
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:25,291
It worked.

758
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:27,893
Your power is gone.

759
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,433
Thank you for giving me
my life back.

760
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:35,934
Now there's only one more thing

761
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,803
for us to do.

762
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:39,638
Just need both of
your signatures

763
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,072
on your marriage license.

764
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:42,774
Then, we can get
to your wedding.

765
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:45,611
I can't wait to be your husband.

766
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,450
The ceremony was groovy.

767
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:54,119
Ji-Eun and Harold seemed
so happy.

768
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,781
And thank you for helping me
pick out this outfit.

769
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,825
That's what roomies do,
right? They, I don't know,

770
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,060
lend each other clothes
and have movie nights.

771
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,080
Speaking of which,
we really do need to do, like,

772
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:06,732
a proper Drew Barrymore binge.

773
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:10,502
Trust me, you're gonna love her.

774
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,305
You know what, and honestly,

775
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:14,840
it's-it's really good to be back

776
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:18,009
and living with somebody
who I can actually trust.

777
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,079
And we can all face
whatever's coming together.

778
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,514
Almost all of us.

779
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:25,451
I know my sister's at Ypsi Med,

780
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:27,018
and I'm not giving up

781
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:28,754
until I free her.

782
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,623
Hey, Jharrel.

783
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:33,124
Hey.

784
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:34,859
See the cake I made
for the happy couple?

785
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:38,930
I still got it.

786
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,266
It's dope.

787
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:41,533
It better be.

788
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,269
Took me two days
to make that thing,

789
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,409
and trying to get it over here
without ruining it...

790
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:48,374
Now I just need the knife
to cut the cake.

791
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:50,309
I swear I brought it down here,
but...

792
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,511
Anyway,

793
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:54,346
where's Manny?
I'm excited to meet him.

794
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,547
I actually can't find him.

795
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:57,383
I don't know
where he would've gone,

796
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:58,950
and I really need
to talk to him.

797
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,486
I'm sure he's around here
somewhere.

798
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:14,900
Wow.

799
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,468
Aw, Logan.

800
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,004
So glad you could join us
for this special occasion.

801
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:21,307
Oh, yeah, man. You know,
it's nice seeing everybody

802
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:23,475
in such good spirits.
I couldn't agree more.

803
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,177
I'll go grab us some drinks.

804
00:37:29,515 --> 00:37:30,749
How are you holding up?

805
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:34,420
It's-it's been a lot.

806
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:37,589
Between managing the-the hotel

807
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:40,158
and planning this weeding,

808
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,094
I haven't really had
a moment to myself.

809
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:47,599
Like, is this it?

810
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:49,835
Is this my life now?

811
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,269
Are you kidding me?

812
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:53,772
You're managing this whole place
by yourself,

813
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,674
and you're doing
a damn good job at it.

814
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:59,778
Yeah, I just don't know
who I am anymore.

815
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:02,548
You're still you.

816
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:04,082
You've always wanted
to help people,

817
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,427
and that's exactly
what you're doing.

818
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:07,686
What you're doing is important.

819
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:19,931
This is... Our wedding song.

820
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:25,471
You want to dance?

821
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,606
Nah, I'm not sure we should...
Come on.

822
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,742
One dance.

823
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,226
What?

824
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,729
You were always such a mushball
at weddings.

825
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:54,800
I'm glad to see
that hasn't changed.

826
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,402
Yeah.

827
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,905
They seem like the real deal.

828
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,140
I'm rooting for them.

829
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,843
Yeah, me, too.

830
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:24,796
Is there something
I can help you with?

831
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,632
I know what you did.

832
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,935
I'm not sure I'm following.

833
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:33,271
You stripped me of my power.

834
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,141
And I want it back.

835
00:39:38,644 --> 00:39:40,712
You said you weren't...

836
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,956
I don't know how to do that.

837
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,695
You knew that already,
didn't you?

838
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:59,064
Maybe.

839
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:02,801
But what was
that thing you said?

840
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:07,405
"All things are possible

841
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:09,374
to him who believeth."

842
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:12,644
What do you believe, Isaiah?

843
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:31,930
What?

844
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:33,431
Excuse me. I just...

845
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:35,200
I-I have to...

846
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:41,405
All right, ready?

847
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,274
One, two, three.

848
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:44,876
I'll do one this way.

849
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,178
And one, two, three.

850
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,020
What?

851
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:12,571
I know this is hard to believe,

852
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,305
but this is
for the greater good.

853
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,468
- What the...?
- Oh, my God.

854
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:45,771
Rev. Rev!

855
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:47,939
Can you hear me?

856
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:49,741
Rev.

857
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,743
Stay with me, Rev.
