1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,834
That's not even...

2
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:11,185
That's just not
how it happened.Keisha.

3
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:14,144
Our first night out in I can't
even remember, and you get us

4
00:00:14,188 --> 00:00:15,537
kicked out with a dance-off.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,495
Miss RiRi tells you to work,
you got to work.

6
00:00:19,628 --> 00:00:22,022
Yeah. See? That's
exactly what...

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,294
Mm-hmm. You know I don't like it
when you sign in secret.

8
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:49,049
But the buns are fresh,
I can assure you.

9
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:51,007
Oh, so you coming for me now?

10
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,530
Don't start nothing
you can't finish.

11
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:55,359
Trust, little sis,
I'm-a finish it.

12
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,884
Come on. Uh.

13
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:00,321
Come on, baby.

14
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:01,496
Hey! Hey!

15
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:09,852
Keisha. Hey, Tarik.

16
00:01:09,895 --> 00:01:12,420
I-I just came to drop this off

17
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:14,161
for the girls' tuition,
all right?

18
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:17,381
Does this mean you're not coming
to Sasha's recital tomorrow?

19
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:20,123
You know, work's been crazy
since this new 4,400 detail.

20
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:22,169
I got a lot
to catch up on, so...

21
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:23,431
Sure.

22
00:01:23,474 --> 00:01:25,346
It's always work.

23
00:01:26,564 --> 00:01:28,740
You know, the girls
really miss you.

24
00:01:28,784 --> 00:01:30,481
You haven't been by in weeks.

25
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:32,918
Yeah, I know. I just...

26
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,748
Give them a hug for me, a'ight?

27
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:42,624
There's something else. Keisha.

28
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,629
I got a letter last week.

29
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:49,283
From him.

30
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:51,372
Who?

31
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:53,069
The man who killed Kenya.

32
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:56,507
He wants to meet with me.

33
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:57,769
And you.

34
00:01:57,813 --> 00:01:59,206
From what it sounds like,

35
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:00,859
he's turned his life around
in prison.

36
00:02:01,904 --> 00:02:04,515
For real. He wants
to make amends

37
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:06,778
and to apologize
to both of us. No way. No way.

38
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:08,171
No way. Tarik,

39
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:09,955
that man might have you fooled,

40
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:12,132
but I will never go
anywhere near him,

41
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:13,481
let alone hear him out, okay?

42
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:14,482
You think I don't know that? No, he took

43
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:15,918
everything from us!

44
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,704
And he's rotting in jail
where he belongs.

45
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:27,495
All right. Everyone,

46
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:29,323
I'd like to introduce
Bill Greene.

47
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:33,327
Bill is our new federal liaison
for the 4,400 Project.

48
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,633
He'll be coordinating Phase 2
of Project Reintegration.

49
00:02:35,677 --> 00:02:38,158
Bill? Thank you, Agent Tanner.

50
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,725
After the success with Phase 1,

51
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:43,772
D.C. has decided
to move into Phase 2:

52
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:45,295
Provisional release.

53
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:48,472
I know, I know. I know
that there are still questions

54
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:49,691
about the 4,400.

55
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:51,693
Everything from elaborate hoax

56
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:53,390
to-to alien activity

57
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:56,176
to time travel
is still being investigated.

58
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,352
But after everything
that happened

59
00:02:58,395 --> 00:03:00,092
in that leaked video,

60
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:01,592
the public is asking
for their release.

61
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:06,055
Transitioning them
from these government facilities

62
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:09,363
and into the world
is the best option for everyone,

63
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:11,191
especially them.

64
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:12,757
In the coming weeks,

65
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:14,933
we will be vetting housing

66
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:17,197
both for people that want
to live with family members

67
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,850
and those who want to live
on their own.

68
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:21,070
Participants chosen
for Phase 2 will be able

69
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:22,637
to come and go from the hotel

70
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,595
with some rules, as
outlined in your briefing.

71
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,814
Basics

72
00:03:25,857 --> 00:03:27,990
like curfew
until permanent housing

73
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:29,252
is approved,

74
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:31,123
regular check-ins
and health screenings

75
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,908
will be mandatory
for all participants.

76
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:35,040
Great. So they're on parole.

77
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:38,000
No. No, no,
these are temporary measures

78
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:40,002
till all of the 4,400
are released for good.

79
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:41,482
Unless

80
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:43,788
anyone here sees a reason
why they shouldn't be?

81
00:03:46,443 --> 00:03:47,879
Good.

82
00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:50,055
Now, remember, these returnees,

83
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,319
above all else, are people.

84
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:54,059
They should be given
the same dignity

85
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,496
and respect

86
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:56,888
that we all deserve.

87
00:03:56,932 --> 00:04:00,152
Agent Abbas will be running
our tech courses

88
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:02,285
as well as supplying
our outgoing 4,400 with phones.

89
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:03,982
If you have any questions,

90
00:04:04,026 --> 00:04:06,246
please reach out either
to myself or to Agent Tanner.

91
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:07,247
Let's get to work.

92
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,944
Soraya.

93
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:10,641
Looks like

94
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:13,165
we'll be vetting
housing options.

95
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:16,038
I guess I just didn't realize
they'd be free so soon.

96
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:18,388
Hey, you.

97
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:20,172
What're you looking at?

98
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:23,175
Jharrel is taking me
to visit apartments today.Oh.

99
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:24,525
This one

100
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:26,091
is near a park, and this one

101
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:28,180
has a swimming pool.

102
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:29,747
You're welcome.

103
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:34,970
For leaking the video I made
on Soraya's computer.

104
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:37,015
What, you thought the government
was setting you up

105
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:39,061
with a pool out of the goodness
of their heart? No.

106
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:41,977
This is CYA for making them
look bad in public. I'm just waiting

107
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,718
for the other shoe to drop.

108
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:46,000
I mean, when has the government
done anything for us folk

109
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:48,505
without a catch? Well, I'm glad
you're getting out.

110
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:51,073
Some of us aren't old enough
to live on our own yet,

111
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:52,683
so we're still prisoners.

112
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:57,601
Especially when people like that

113
00:04:57,645 --> 00:04:59,125
are still in here
with the rest of us.

114
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:05,566
Okay, like, I get the kid's

115
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:07,785
mad his little girlfriend
isn't back yet, but damn.

116
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:09,309
If the video's
getting people out,

117
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:11,136
that should be worth something,
right?

118
00:05:21,712 --> 00:05:23,497
My apologies, Mrs. Murray.

119
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,541
No, not at all.

120
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:25,803
It's my bad.

121
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,762
Sleeping well, I presume?

122
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:30,721
I seem to be the only member

123
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:33,724
of the insomniacs club
this past week.

124
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:35,422
Right, yeah.

125
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:37,859
No, uh, it's, um...

126
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:42,777
I'm not avoiding you
since our-our...

127
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,387
Nor am I you.

128
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:53,570
I have a surprise

129
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:55,137
for you.

130
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,835
If you would be so kind
as to accompany me?

131
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,663
Where?

132
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:08,019
Where does it lead?

133
00:06:08,063 --> 00:06:09,891
Let me show you.

134
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:16,463
May I?

135
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:20,728
I presume Miss Mildred worked
her magic on yours, as well?

136
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,603
They'll never know we're gone.

137
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:32,174
Mariah Kaminski

138
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:34,263
fakes right.
She flicks to the shoulder.

139
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:36,265
Bam! Flunge to the head.

140
00:06:36,308 --> 00:06:39,573
Oh, enjoy the silver, Tessa.

141
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:41,226
This calls for a celebration.

142
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,967
Yes. Whatever you want, kiddo.

143
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:47,755
Listen, we discussed this.

144
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:49,974
We are considering it. Come on,

145
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:51,889
Dad. I mean, I get it's awkward,

146
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:53,456
but Shanice staying here
with us?

147
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,936
It feels
like we could actually be

148
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:57,025
a family. Allof us.

149
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:58,505
I mean, I...

150
00:06:58,548 --> 00:06:59,897
I just want to get to know her.

151
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:03,161
I understand that, Ry, but...

152
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:04,772
The house is being vetted today.

153
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:06,924
I mean, do you really want her
locked up in a hotel room

154
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:09,167
when we have
a perfectly good room here?

155
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,260
If it's something
you really want, sweetheart,

156
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:16,697
we'll make it happen.

157
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,568
Thank you, Mom.

158
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,179
Hello?

159
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:22,920
Yeah, hi.

160
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:28,883
Video?

161
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:31,451
What video?

162
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:38,370
This is crazy.

163
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:41,112
I never thought I'd actually
use a prohibition tunnel.

164
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:43,941
Feel like Nancy Drew.

165
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:47,858
Okay, first stop, the library.

166
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,474
Wait, should we be doing this?

167
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,085
We're about to be released.

168
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:58,541
If we get caught,
they could retaliate.

169
00:07:58,565 --> 00:07:59,914
Youare about to be released.

170
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:01,655
I don't know
when my time will come.

171
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:03,657
I haven't heard anything yet.

172
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:06,660
You promised to show me Detroit.

173
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:09,663
And before you go
back to your family,

174
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:12,753
I want to spend one last day
with you.

175
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:17,192
Well, a promise is a promise.

176
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:22,458
Look, I just think
something seemed off.

177
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,112
Well, you should speak with her.Morning.

178
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:25,722
My name is Miguel,

179
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:27,570
the new on-site doctor.
Lovely to meet you both.

180
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:28,962
Nice to meet you,
Miguel. We were try... I'm vetting

181
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:31,815
family housing options
for Shanice Murray.

182
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:34,818
Yes. Mrs. Murray has been
cleared for release.

183
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:37,255
And I am with Claudette
Williams today.

184
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:40,520
Uh, maybe we should switch.

185
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:42,522
You can do the walkthrough
at the Kaminskis',

186
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:45,176
and I can take Claudette. Oh, hard pass.

187
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,178
What, vetting Logan's
house so that his ex-wife

188
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:49,224
can stay with him
and his current wife?

189
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:51,269
Yeah, I want
no part of that drama.

190
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,536
All right, here we go.

191
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:59,495
Both screened and cleared.
Anything else I can do for you?

192
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,366
That's about it. Are you sure
they're cleared?

193
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,759
Uh, has anyone

194
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:05,588
come to your office
with anything... weird?

195
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:06,981
Do they need any more shots?

196
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:08,460
Blood samples?

197
00:09:08,504 --> 00:09:10,767
Like I said, they're good to go.

198
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:12,856
Thank you, Miguel.

199
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:17,818
Yo, what is your deal?

200
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:19,317
First, you were weird at
the staff meeting earlier,

201
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:21,256
then whatever the hell
that was with Miguel.

202
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,040
Keisha, we're partners.

203
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:24,738
All right? You can talk to me.

204
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:26,914
I'm concerned, okay?

205
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:28,655
What if the medics
miss something?

206
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:30,918
What if we miss something?
You have to admit,

207
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:32,876
weird stuff
follows these people around. Yeah,

208
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,941
because the government is
pitting them against everyone. Oh,

209
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:36,769
did the government put us to
sleep on Belle Isle that night?

210
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,665
We never even got

211
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,840
to hear what Soraya found.

212
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:41,493
And last week on my outing

213
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:43,583
with Shanice and Claudette,
I saw...

214
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:46,934
It just...
It makes me nervous, okay?

215
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:48,805
I-I don't want anyone
to get hurt.

216
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:50,633
Okay, and here I thought

217
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:53,201
you were finally coming around
on "these people."

218
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:56,291
Why are you so quick
to believe the worst in them?

219
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:58,182
I guess you can't take
that cop hat off, can you?

220
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:59,729
Look, screw you, Jharrel.

221
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:01,620
You're not gonna paint me
as some kind of monster

222
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:04,125
for trying to keep the public
safe, for doing my job.

223
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:06,301
What, finding excuses
to keep people locked up?

224
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:07,432
Wow.

225
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:08,608
What a great job.

226
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:20,445
My, my, my. This city

227
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:22,360
sure is something.

228
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:25,929
Oh, I can't believe
how good this feels.

229
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:27,690
You want to look up directions
to our next stop?

230
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:30,151
I know
you didn't just ask me that.

231
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:32,762
It's how we get around in 2021.

232
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:35,306
Well, I barely trust paper maps.
I'm sure as hell not gonna trust

233
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,636
some gadget I don't understand.

234
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,115
All right, fair enough.

235
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,595
I miss driving.

236
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,772
Wind in my hair.
My own little pocket of freedom.

237
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:44,948
Where were you?

238
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:47,255
When you were taken?

239
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:48,691
Does that mean you believe

240
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:50,451
we were taken
from different places and times?

241
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:54,392
'Cause shoe on the other foot,
I don't know if I'd believe us.

242
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,309
Well, believing y'all means...

243
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:01,095
my missing brother Manny
could still be out there.

244
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:05,447
You know, it means that I
don't have to give up hope.

245
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,973
'Cause if you can go
from the 1950s to now,

246
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:11,671
anything's possible.

247
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,850
And, unlike
some of my colleagues,

248
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:21,071
I believe y'all when you say
that you have nothing to hide.

249
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:22,507
You know? You're not

250
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:24,771
some threat to the public.

251
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:26,729
I just want to give

252
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:28,078
you all the chance

253
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:30,559
to show the world
that you can be trusted.

254
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,478
You ready?

255
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,959
Ready for what?

256
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:41,352
Uh, there is a gas station
up the road.

257
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:42,789
I'm gonna fill it up,

258
00:11:42,832 --> 00:11:44,201
and you can get
behind the wheel and...

259
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:45,705
You're gonna let me
drive your car?

260
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:47,489
Yeah.

261
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:50,318
I told you, I trust you.

262
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:59,631
I can't believe how much
it's changed in 16 years.

263
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:04,071
Were there canines pushed
in strollers 16 years ago,

264
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:06,726
or is this a more
recent development?

265
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,032
Oh. Cars.

266
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:11,818
How do they not crash
into each other at such speeds?

267
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:13,820
Oh. The lighted beacons.
Do they communicate

268
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:15,647
with the cars? Wait, Andre.

269
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,258
Hey, watch it.

270
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:23,525
Come on. Got a lot to see.

271
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:30,401
Really appreciate you taking the
lead on these tech tutorials.

272
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:32,752
Sure. Happy to help.

273
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:35,319
Soraya here will get you set up
with everything you need, ma'am.

274
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:37,278
Mine doesn't have
an "on" button.

275
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:40,716
Uh, so,
just like we did in class,

276
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,109
you just toggle
your phone a bit,

277
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:43,763
and then the home
screen will pop up.

278
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:46,243
My God.
How does it know how to do that?

279
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:47,810
Gyroscope?

280
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:49,812
Or maybe the light sensor?

281
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:53,381
Both, actually.
Thank you.

282
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:56,950
I didn't know you were back.

283
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:00,083
I'm sorry about the video,

284
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:01,911
but, you know,
desperate times and all that,

285
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:03,434
so...

286
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:07,177
Speaking of, um,

287
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:08,700
I need your help.
So, me and Andre

288
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:10,267
are trying to crack
this COBOL code.

289
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:11,549
Do you maybe have, like,
a program that we could...

290
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:13,575
Are you kidding me right now?

291
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:17,535
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

292
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:21,539
I trusted you, and
you betrayed me.

293
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,474
Plus, I've seen enough
of your fake apologies on TV

294
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:25,195
to know one when I see it.

295
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:27,589
I'm sorry, fake?
No, I was trying to... I should go.

296
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,681
Before you get us both
into more trouble.

297
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:43,126
My husband had
a 1951 Oldsmobile 88.

298
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,782
Mm, how that machine could run.

299
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,610
Yeah, what did you do back then?

300
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,046
In Mississippi?

301
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,223
I was an activist.
A photographer.

302
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:55,530
Organizing sit-ins and
getting the word out.

303
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:57,837
My husband may have been
the face of the movement,

304
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,709
but my photos
are what made the papers.

305
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:03,581
You know what? Now the 4,400
are the ones in the papers.

306
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,106
I'd just as well prefer
to stay behind the camera.

307
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:09,283
Yeah, but you...
You traveled through time.

308
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:11,154
That's got to be...

309
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:13,678
It must be wild.

310
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:16,899
I'm here now. Just trying
to make the most of it.

311
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:23,601
Yeah?

312
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:25,865
No, I can't right now.

313
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:28,084
Because I have a job.

314
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:31,783
All right, fine. I'll be there.

315
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:37,006
Hey, I'm sorry. Can you
pull over at the next bend?

316
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,095
I got to take you back
to the hotel.

317
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:40,923
What? Now?

318
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:43,186
We aren't due back
until at least 3:00.

319
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,903
I wa... I was hoping we
could grab some lunch out.

320
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,886
That hotel food is criminal.

321
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,539
Okay, how about this?

322
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,933
We can get lunch, but...

323
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,501
you got to come
with me somewhere first.

324
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:56,634
Where we going?

325
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,598
Hey, Hayden. Can I come in?

326
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:05,165
Any news on Mildred?

327
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,254
Or Noah?

328
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,214
Isn't it your job
to get them back?

329
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:13,782
I will make a call
to Ypsi Med myself.

330
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,915
See if I can get any updates.

331
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:19,919
But my job is a parole officer.

332
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,573
I help people who are
newly free stay free

333
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:26,229
by making sure they're equipped
to deal with the outside world.

334
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:30,059
I have that same
protectiveness for you.

335
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:32,496
For all the 4,400.

336
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:37,762
Which is why I need to make
sure there are no surprises...

337
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:40,504
before I'm out there
vouching for everyone.

338
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:42,680
Because I was with Claudette
at Mrs. Grover's,

339
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:45,596
and I saw something.

340
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,511
But I protected her.

341
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:49,426
I did my job.

342
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,212
And I can only do
that job if the people

343
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:54,475
I'm trying to help are
honest with me, so, Hayden,

344
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:56,694
please... if there's anything

345
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:59,132
I need to know before we go
out into the real world,

346
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:01,743
I need you to tell me.

347
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:09,272
I don't like to lie.

348
00:16:09,316 --> 00:16:11,448
And I don't like being lied to.

349
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:28,161
What is this?

350
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:32,165
Welcome.

351
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,429
Pray tell, what country does
this flag belong to?

352
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:37,779
Uh, it's the Pride flag.

353
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:40,086
It, uh, represents

354
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:42,566
the LGBTQIA+ community.

355
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,742
Um, it's all about inclusion.

356
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,744
This is a place where
everyone can celebrate

357
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,287
exactly who they are
and who they love,

358
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:51,532
and show that love
to the world, proudly.

359
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:53,795
We should stay.

360
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:55,338
I've never been to Pride,
and we could celebrate

361
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:57,320
our first one together.

362
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:01,498
How is this even possible?

363
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,510
This is just like
my and Cynthia's little corner

364
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:15,469
of Harlem, but...

365
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:17,427
all out in the open.

366
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:20,039
It's marvelous.

367
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:22,302
Yeah... marvelous.

368
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:26,349
We don't have to stay
if you feel uncomfortable.

369
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:30,092
No. That's not...

370
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:32,529
It's not Pride or anyone here.

371
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:35,097
I'm not about to judge
who or how anyone loves.

372
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,925
Then what's wrong?

373
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:39,841
Andre, I was married

374
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:41,408
three weeks ago.

375
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:44,802
He's still...

376
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:47,066
out there.

377
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,806
And I'm...

378
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,724
You and I are...

379
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:56,205
I'm not asking for anything.

380
00:17:56,249 --> 00:17:59,904
All I want is for us to have
one last day out on the town.

381
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,516
No matter what happens tomorrow.

382
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:27,367
She'll have her own bedroom,
her own bathroom.

383
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,239
Um, just across the hall
from Mariah.

384
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:33,112
Our room is at the other end,
which is... good.

385
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:35,244
The neighborhood's very safe.

386
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:37,203
I run every morning,
rain or shine.

387
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:39,074
Um, Mariah's

388
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,399
really looking forward to
spending more time with her mom.

389
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:43,818
Mother... Shanice.

390
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:46,647
I'm sorry,
I feel like I'm bungling this.

391
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,952
No, you're, you're doing great.

392
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,954
It's not just this...
Last time I saw you,

393
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:51,478
you were on my porch saying.

394
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:53,088
Shanice is
a national security threat,

395
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,482
then Mariah gets called
in for questioning...

396
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:57,310
Well, like I said,
she's a minor, so...

397
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:59,007
And now I'm giving you
a tour in hopes

398
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,835
my husband's
first wife moves in?

399
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:04,317
I know...

400
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,623
Shanice is
Mariah's biological mother.

401
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,495
But...

402
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:10,149
is it safe to have her here?

403
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,368
In our home?

404
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:14,849
Is that a terrible thing to ask?

405
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:16,764
No, no, it's not.

406
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:18,461
You know, our medics and
officials

407
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:20,202
have cleared everyone
for release.

408
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:22,857
But everything's a risk, right?

409
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:26,208
I guess you have to decide
if not taking the risk

410
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:28,036
is worth the regret.

411
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:31,170
Let's go see the backyard.

412
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:35,870
What are you... Listen.

413
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:37,500
Listen, act
like we're buying some coffee.

414
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:39,308
Um, buying coffee, what?

415
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:40,590
Shh! Shh! Let me know
if you ladies need any help.

416
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:41,571
Take your time.

417
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:43,443
My office got a tip

418
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:45,508
that this place is gonna be
available for lease soon.

419
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:46,881
Like, a matter of days, soon.

420
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:48,448
Okay, does he know that?

421
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:50,667
Picture it... down the street
from the library,

422
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,495
excellent foot traffic,

423
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:54,367
enough space
for the banquette by the door,

424
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,977
like you always wanted.

425
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,370
But you're gonna
have to act fast

426
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:59,328
because this place will get
snatched up quick.

427
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:01,678
But I do think I can get it
for a steal.

428
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:03,985
Oh, Ken, be real...
I can't just empty my savings

429
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:05,378
for something so risky.

430
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:06,964
Look, I got to think
about you, the girls...

431
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:08,685
You don't.

432
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:10,861
Nobody asked you to do all that.

433
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:12,820
Tarik and I can handle it
on our own just fine.

434
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:14,169
Come on, we both know

435
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,364
money has been tight for you.

436
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:17,999
Plus...

437
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,784
Say it.

438
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:23,178
We both know you and Tarik

439
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,180
haven't always been
the most stable couple.

440
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,269
Mm-hmm, okay, see,
you always do this.

441
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:29,271
This isn't about me
or the girls or Tarik.

442
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:31,447
This is about you not wanting
to take a risk

443
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:33,057
to go after what you want.

444
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:35,364
And I'm not gonna let you use
my family as an excuse.

445
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:36,887
If you're too much of a coward

446
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:38,889
to go after what you want, fine.

447
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:40,978
But that's on you.

448
00:20:41,022 --> 00:20:43,242
Kenya... Kenya? Uh-uh, uh-uh!

449
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:49,160
Look, I'm sorry about that.

450
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:51,685
Landlord's raising the rent
on this place, so...

451
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:53,208
got to let it go.

452
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,514
But, um, I don't like

453
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:55,969
people snooping around here
when I'm gone,

454
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:57,473
so whenever somebody wants

455
00:20:57,517 --> 00:20:59,345
to see the place, I...

456
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:02,304
But never mind.

457
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:05,002
This is Manny's apartment,
isn't it?

458
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:08,310
Yeah, for the next 16 days,
yeah.

459
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:11,487
Yeah, he's been gone for a
year, but I can't let it go.

460
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,228
Not when...

461
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:16,318
When he could
still be out there?

462
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:17,885
Yeah, I know
it must seem crazy...

463
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:20,061
Crazier than traveling
through time and space?

464
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:23,456
Okay, you got me on that.

465
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:27,329
I never had a place of my own.

466
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:29,766
I went from my parent's house
to my husband's house,

467
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,726
to... well, the Bois Blanc.

468
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:35,772
The only time I had for myself
was one weekend a month.

469
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:39,733
Uh, my husband would meet
with the southern leaders

470
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:41,778
of the movement in Georgia.

471
00:21:41,822 --> 00:21:44,694
And the second I heard that 88
rumble out of the driveway...

472
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:46,957
that's when me and my 33s

473
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:48,524
came out to play, honey.

474
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:54,095
I'd cook cornbread
in my mama's skillet, and...

475
00:21:54,138 --> 00:21:55,488
listen to sinful men

476
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:57,577
croon to me on my record player.

477
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,449
I lived for those weekends.

478
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:09,806
No wonder you lot are obsessed

479
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,895
with those things.

480
00:22:15,943 --> 00:22:17,466
You know what?

481
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,468
There is a meat and three place

482
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:21,775
delivers here...

483
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:22,950
best cornbread in town.

484
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:24,081
All right.

485
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:36,659
When they didn't do it
with the flag... Yes!

486
00:22:36,703 --> 00:22:38,835
Shanice?

487
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:41,360
Logan, uh...

488
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,667
We were just... uh...

489
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:46,930
Andre Davis.

490
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:48,410
And you must be Mr. Kaminski.

491
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:49,977
And Miss Mariah.

492
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,805
I've heard so much
about you both.

493
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:54,155
Check out a lot of clubs, Andre?

494
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:57,245
Pleasure to meet you both.

495
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:02,642
We just stumbled
across a Pride party.

496
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,123
You know, it doesn't... matter.

497
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,690
I knew you were cool, but...

498
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:10,214
I mean, a jailbreak
to hit up Pride? Nice.

499
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:12,086
Okay, but why are you here?

500
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:13,783
Are you okay?

501
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:16,090
What happened?

502
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:17,961
I'm fine,
they just had a few questions

503
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:19,548
about the viral video
I sent out, but...

504
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:21,095
Wait, you sent that video?

505
00:23:21,138 --> 00:23:22,444
Do you haveany idea

506
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:23,813
how much trouble
you could've gotten in?

507
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:25,447
I'm a minor.

508
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:26,927
And I only shared a video

509
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,470
that was sent to me...
That's not a crime.

510
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:30,409
That's just... the Internet.

511
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:32,367
Okay, will you give us
a second, Ry?

512
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,543
Fine.

513
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:39,635
Listen.

514
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,463
They brought Mariah in
for questioning

515
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:43,509
about this-this
whole video thing.

516
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:45,554
DHS is questioning mydaughter.

517
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:47,991
And you're just gonna move in?

518
00:23:48,035 --> 00:23:49,689
With all of this
surrounding you?

519
00:23:49,732 --> 00:23:50,733
I mean, God knows

520
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:52,213
what'll happen with Mariah,

521
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:53,408
the more she's connected to you.

522
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,824
Whoa, Logan, I didn't

523
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:56,913
know... Exactly.

524
00:23:58,088 --> 00:23:59,481
Come on, let's go.

525
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:17,412
All right, does anybody want
to do a lap before committing?

526
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,129
If you're looking for gentlemen,
there appear

527
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:20,894
to be some options
by the dart board.

528
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:24,941
Good lookin' out, C.

529
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:28,510
The bar. Mm-hmm.

530
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:31,905
So I know I'm only here
for my credit card.

531
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:34,864
But... thank you for the invite.

532
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:37,040
Not gonna lie, you looked

533
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:38,912
about as bad as I feel.

534
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:41,088
Which is... saying something.

535
00:24:41,131 --> 00:24:43,482
Everything checked out today
at Logan's house.

536
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:46,025
Once I submit the approval, you
should be able to move right in.

537
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:47,311
Maybe even tomorrow.

538
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:51,620
I can't do it.

539
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:53,013
I mean, I was going to

540
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:54,667
for Mariah's sake,
but I can't live

541
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,364
with my husband and his wife.

542
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:58,453
Oh, yeah, well, that,
that is messy.

543
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,499
Totally messy!

544
00:25:03,197 --> 00:25:05,373
How was his, um...?

545
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,027
Bridget seems...

546
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,463
sweet.

547
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,422
House is a little Chip
and Joanna for my taste,

548
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:13,555
but, uh...

549
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,992
I don't know,
it felt... like a home.

550
00:25:16,036 --> 00:25:17,951
Good.

551
00:25:17,994 --> 00:25:19,866
Yeah, that's good.

552
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:24,392
I know I should want him
to have moved on.

553
00:25:24,435 --> 00:25:27,308
Like, a better person
would want him

554
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:29,876
to get remarried and...

555
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,704
maybe have more kids.

556
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:34,010
Live a happy life. I just...

557
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,623
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to dump all that on you.

558
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:40,843
I-I've had a day myself.

559
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:43,933
I may not have come
from the past,

560
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:45,979
but it sure has
a way of sneaking in

561
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:47,894
when you least expect it,
you know?

562
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:54,161
Sanitation check!

563
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:57,904
If you have any contraband,
you better tell me now.

564
00:25:57,947 --> 00:25:59,906
I-I-I don't.

565
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:01,908
Well, well, what's this? It's my chess set.

566
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:03,649
Looks like someone's got
sticky fingers.

567
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:05,215
I'm confiscating it.

568
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:07,174
What? No, no, it's not,
it's not stolen, please!

569
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:09,176
Another video comes out
with this place looking

570
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:11,787
anything less than clean and
orderly, we might lose our jobs.

571
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,310
You wouldn't want that, right?

572
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:15,530
To see
good working people fired?

573
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,879
But it's mine.

574
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:18,707
My-my friend gave it to me.

575
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,188
Well, your friend clearly stole
government property.

576
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:23,407
So either I take this now,

577
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:26,193
or you give me
the name of your friend.

578
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:42,165
Oh, "texpert."

579
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:43,776
I tried to catch up
with you earlier,

580
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:45,734
but you ran off pretty quickly.

581
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:47,301
Yeah, there's just

582
00:26:47,344 --> 00:26:49,042
a lot going on here.

583
00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:51,000
Sure, sure, but...

584
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:52,872
I mean, what happened?

585
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:54,613
Are you okay?

586
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:55,744
Uh... I'm fine.

587
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:57,746
Just... busy.

588
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,792
Right.

589
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:02,490
All right, well, I'll get
out of your hair, but...

590
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:04,797
Listen.

591
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,600
What did you want to tell
me before you left?

592
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,757
About the body cam footage
from Belle Isle?

593
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:10,324
Is it something to do
with Manny or...?

594
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:13,632
There's just
a lot going on here.

595
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:15,677
But no, it-it turns out

596
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:17,418
the tape was nothing...
It was just...

597
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:19,159
someone singing.

598
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:20,943
Singing?

599
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:24,662
Uh, maybe it had something
to do with the song itself or...

600
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:26,732
Or maybe it's the singer?

601
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,650
Look, whatever it is,

602
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,695
you're on your own.

603
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:36,089
I just had eight days
of brutal questioning

604
00:27:36,132 --> 00:27:37,656
to think about it and...

605
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:40,876
my answer is
that it's just a song.

606
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,573
Anything past that,

607
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:44,227
I'm not your girl.

608
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:45,489
Oh, Soraya, I didn't...

609
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:47,622
I'm so sorry. I gotta go.

610
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:52,453
We have been given
a second chance!

611
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:53,846
Who else can say that?

612
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:56,152
We could do anything we want! Preach!

613
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:58,372
I'm gonna learn pottery.

614
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:00,548
Sure you are!

615
00:28:02,202 --> 00:28:04,378
Uh, from the table
in the corner.

616
00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:10,950
Well, look at that.

617
00:28:10,993 --> 00:28:13,039
We're famous!

618
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:15,432
Freaks!

619
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:17,304
Excuse me?

620
00:28:17,347 --> 00:28:19,175
Hey, he is not worth it.

621
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:20,699
I'm not worth it?

622
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,570
I saw your video online.

623
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:25,138
You and your little alien
lizard-people friends

624
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:27,227
better steer clear of this bar.

625
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,055
Or something bad's gonna happen.

626
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,667
I'm scared. Shakin' in my shoes.

627
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,451
That's right, bitch.

628
00:28:34,495 --> 00:28:35,931
Who's the bitch now?

629
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:48,074
We need to get her some help!

630
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:50,511
No, I'm fine!

631
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:04,264
You were never here.
Okay, get back

632
00:29:04,307 --> 00:29:06,222
to the hotel, now!

633
00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:19,758
Hey, Soraya, um,

634
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,411
look, I want you
to know how sorry

635
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:23,196
I am for what happened to you.

636
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,198
If I knew you'd get taken away

637
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:27,896
like that, like... I guess
I just didn't think about

638
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,029
the bad things
that video could do.

639
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:32,161
Which is what I saw tonight.

640
00:29:32,205 --> 00:29:33,641
I'm sorry.

641
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:35,251
Thank you.

642
00:29:35,295 --> 00:29:36,426
That means a lot.

643
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:40,517
Listen.

644
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:42,258
You know what it feels
like to be treated

645
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:44,142
like you've committed a
crime when you haven't.

646
00:29:44,173 --> 00:29:46,828
I mean, yeah, of course.

647
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:48,699
I'm Muslim,

648
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:51,572
queer, a woman and work
for the U.S. government.

649
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:54,183
Being questioned is
being convicted

650
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:56,316
in the eyes of a lot of
the people around us already.

651
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,926
So when I was
dragged out of here

652
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,233
in front of my peers, basically

653
00:30:00,276 --> 00:30:02,365
accused of treason...

654
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:04,150
it's fair to say

655
00:30:04,193 --> 00:30:06,021
I don't feel
any more safe coming to work.

656
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:07,675
You should know...

657
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:09,068
the United States is a far more

658
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:10,809
frightening place
than it was six years ago

659
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:12,071
when you disappeared.

660
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:13,463
More divided.

661
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:14,813
Facts are gone.

662
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:16,292
Truth is debated.

663
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:18,164
And people who are
supposed to protect

664
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:19,556
people like you and...

665
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,645
and the 4,400...

666
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:27,782
You should be careful is all.

667
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,263
For what it's worth...

668
00:30:30,306 --> 00:30:32,656
I'm on your side.

669
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,312
That's why I'm a queer Muslim
woman working in the government.

670
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:38,662
It is certainly not for the pay.

671
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:40,839
Thank you, Soraya.

672
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:42,492
For everything.

673
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:44,843
And, um...

674
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:47,541
not for nothing, but...

675
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:50,065
it took mad skills
to do what you did.

676
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,330
Couple more classes,
maybe I could hire you.

677
00:30:54,374 --> 00:30:55,766
At least that way
I could fire you

678
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,465
next time you
screw up so royally.

679
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:02,991
Night.

680
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:08,214
Shanice?

681
00:31:08,257 --> 00:31:09,868
I missed you at our...

682
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:26,232
Thanks, Logan.

683
00:31:27,494 --> 00:31:28,625
I love you.

684
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:38,200
Tell me why.

685
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:40,507
No, make it make sense to me.
Why would you disgrace.

686
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,075
Kenya's memory by going to visit
the man that killed her?

687
00:31:44,337 --> 00:31:46,730
You want to keep it down
before you wake your nieces up?

688
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:51,170
Now, I know this may be hard
for you to understand...

689
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:53,215
Oh, this is impossible
to understand.

690
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:55,565
I'm barely keeping it
together as it is!

691
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:57,828
I shouldn't have be standing
here, on your front porch,

692
00:31:57,872 --> 00:32:01,615
begging you not to go visit
the man that murdered my sister!

693
00:32:01,658 --> 00:32:04,139
What, we're supposed
to just forgive him?

694
00:32:04,183 --> 00:32:07,055
I'm not asking you
to forgive him, Keisha.

695
00:32:08,274 --> 00:32:11,320
I'm saying that I'm open
to talking with him

696
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:14,106
so he doesn't take
any more from me.

697
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:16,064
Like what he's taken from you.

698
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:17,674
What?

699
00:32:17,718 --> 00:32:19,285
You used to smile.

700
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:21,026
You used to be fun.

701
00:32:21,069 --> 00:32:23,004
You used to dance and bake
and sing off-key karaoke...

702
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:24,333
This was a mistake...

703
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:25,944
No, you never missed
a school play!

704
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,641
Not once.

705
00:32:28,642 --> 00:32:30,861
I mean, God, you barely

706
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:33,560
see your nieces,
and it crushes them.

707
00:32:34,822 --> 00:32:36,911
It's like you're not even
the same person.

708
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,348
Well, what about you, Tarik?

709
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:41,524
Hmm? 'Cause you haven't
changed a bit.

710
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:42,917
So what does that say about you?

711
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,571
You... Did you ever really love her?

712
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:54,015
I barely made it

713
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,278
through Kenya's death
in one piece.

714
00:32:56,322 --> 00:32:58,019
The only thing
that got me through my grief

715
00:32:58,063 --> 00:32:59,847
was forgiveness. I mean, God!

716
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,806
I could barely
look at you after I found...

717
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:05,940
What?

718
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:09,161
Come on, after what?

719
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:10,379
Tarik!

720
00:33:12,468 --> 00:33:14,209
Kenya wasn't on the way home

721
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:16,211
from the library
the night she died.

722
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:20,433
She was coming
from the coffee shop.

723
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:25,438
She'd gone to take
some measurements

724
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:27,527
after store hours.

725
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:31,922
She knew you'd always

726
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:34,316
liked banquette
seating by the door.

727
00:33:35,448 --> 00:33:38,407
So she wanted to get
a quote for the work.

728
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,453
She was planning on
surprising you. No.

729
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:42,542
I didn't know, I...

730
00:33:43,543 --> 00:33:45,458
I was, I was going
to take her advice and,

731
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:47,938
and I was going to try for
my own shop, but after she...

732
00:33:47,982 --> 00:33:50,811
I just, I couldn't... After Kenya died,

733
00:33:50,854 --> 00:33:52,856
you devoted your life
to a system

734
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,728
that keeps people in boxes

735
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:56,512
and strips them
of their humanity

736
00:33:56,556 --> 00:33:58,384
in the name of safety.

737
00:33:58,427 --> 00:34:00,188
No, I'm trying to keep bad
people off the streets, you...

738
00:34:00,212 --> 00:34:02,779
There is no such
thing as bad people!

739
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:04,868
Or good!

740
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:06,957
People are messy.

741
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:10,831
People make mistakes.

742
00:34:10,874 --> 00:34:13,660
Choices they wish
they could take back.

743
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:15,488
You cut everyone out.

744
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:17,707
And it's eating away at you.

745
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:19,187
Bit by bit.

746
00:34:19,231 --> 00:34:21,320
Kenya was my person.

747
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:25,672
And she died.

748
00:34:25,715 --> 00:34:27,239
I'm worried, Keish.

749
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:30,024
That if you can't learn
to let someone in again...

750
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,895
Anyone...

751
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:34,637
Then you're living
in your own kind of prison.

752
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:40,339
And that's the last thing
Kenya would want for you.

753
00:34:49,391 --> 00:34:52,699
Hey. Thanks for letting
me come over.

754
00:34:52,742 --> 00:34:55,745
Course. Everything okay?

755
00:34:55,789 --> 00:34:57,897
Please just let me say this
before I change my mind, okay?

756
00:34:57,921 --> 00:34:59,575
I...

757
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:01,925
I'm sorry about this morning.
Between my sister's ex

758
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:04,667
and Kenya's killer wanting
to make amends, I...

759
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:06,800
I'm sorry.
It must be overwhelming. No,

760
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:08,845
"overwhelming" doesn't cut it.

761
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:10,804
When things got like this,

762
00:35:10,847 --> 00:35:12,240
I always went to my sister.

763
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:14,329
A-And she was the only one

764
00:35:14,373 --> 00:35:16,288
that could get
these feelings out,

765
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:17,874
and according to Tarik,
I need to let someone in

766
00:35:17,898 --> 00:35:20,509
before I completely lose it,
so I...

767
00:35:20,553 --> 00:35:22,946
I'm telling you.

768
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:27,255
Because I do trust you
even though you drive me crazy.

769
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:29,388
I'm honored.

770
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:31,564
All I ever wanted to do here
was my job.

771
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:32,652
Get to the truth.

772
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:35,176
Protect the people. But I...

773
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,613
Look, I have something
I need to tell you.

774
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:41,356
I saw Claudette...

775
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,837
heal herself.

776
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,665
Heal herself?

777
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:49,234
Yeah, she cut herself on some
glass at the bar, and it...

778
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:53,325
It was deep.

779
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:55,718
But then it just closed up
like nothing happened.

780
00:35:55,762 --> 00:35:57,155
And I don't think this is

781
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:58,982
the first time, and...

782
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:01,724
I don't know what it means,
but I know it means something.

783
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:07,382
Maybe it's not about the song.

784
00:36:07,426 --> 00:36:09,428
Maybe it's about the singer.

785
00:36:09,471 --> 00:36:10,864
What?

786
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:14,172
Oh, yeah,
it's something Soraya said.

787
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:16,217
Listen, whatever's happening,

788
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:18,350
it isn't just happening
with Claudette.

789
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:20,003
Something

790
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:22,571
is going on with the 4,400.

791
00:36:22,615 --> 00:36:25,661
Something beyond the scope
of our understanding.

792
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:28,316
And there's people out there who
already see them as a threat.

793
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:31,928
So, what do we do?

794
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,330
I thought we were going to
visit a potential apartment.

795
00:36:44,463 --> 00:36:47,814
A place all your own.

796
00:36:47,857 --> 00:36:50,033
Oh, my word.

797
00:36:50,077 --> 00:36:51,470
Really?

798
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:53,167
Yeah.

799
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,343
The government is gonna pay
the new rental price,

800
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:58,172
and Manny's place
will go to someone

801
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,565
who will take care of it.

802
00:36:59,608 --> 00:37:01,219
Win-win.

803
00:37:04,787 --> 00:37:07,268
Thank you.

804
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:09,705
Listen,

805
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:12,273
there's something
I need to tell you.

806
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:15,668
I know.

807
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:19,715
Know what, exactly?

808
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:21,674
No.

809
00:37:21,717 --> 00:37:24,067
I know.

810
00:37:28,724 --> 00:37:30,944
You know about...

811
00:37:30,987 --> 00:37:32,206
me.

812
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,426
Whoa, hey, it's okay.

813
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:36,166
All right? You can trust me. I knew

814
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,796
this was too good to be true.
It was Keisha, wasn't it?

815
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,518
Girl's got a big damn mouth.

816
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:41,215
You can trust her, too.

817
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:43,391
I promise.

818
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:44,740
We just want to help.

819
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:51,399
Hey.

820
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:53,314
Did you find out about Mildred?

821
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:55,055
Um, not yet.

822
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:57,753
But I'm working on it.

823
00:37:57,797 --> 00:38:00,408
Hayden, I heard
about your chess set.

824
00:38:00,452 --> 00:38:02,584
I'm sure that was
really scary for you.

825
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:04,325
I'm gonna report that guard.

826
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:05,674
Why?

827
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:07,285
That's what they do.

828
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:09,330
Yeah.

829
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:13,595
So...

830
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:15,902
How would you feel about
getting out of here?

831
00:38:16,903 --> 00:38:19,558
Yeah, since Shanice
isn't leaving,

832
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:21,255
there's an open room
at Logan's house.

833
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,779
Mariah convinced him
not to let it go to waste.

834
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,782
Mariah did that? She did.

835
00:38:26,826 --> 00:38:29,089
Logan signed off
to be your guardian

836
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:32,222
until we can find a next of kin.
But only if you agree.

837
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:35,835
You're important to me, Hayden.

838
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:39,360
So,

839
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:41,057
what do you think?

840
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:43,712
Yeah.

841
00:38:43,756 --> 00:38:46,019
I'd like that.

842
00:38:48,021 --> 00:38:51,372
We've tried the oatmeal bath,
but she won't stop scratching.

843
00:40:02,356 --> 00:40:04,227
Yo, Keish.

844
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:06,447
Hey. Uh, listen,

845
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:07,970
I was wrong.

846
00:40:08,014 --> 00:40:09,494
Okay, I may not be there yet,

847
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:11,452
but if you want to visit
that man in prison,

848
00:40:11,496 --> 00:40:12,801
you should.

849
00:40:13,846 --> 00:40:15,630
You sure you're okay with that?

850
00:40:15,674 --> 00:40:18,024
Yeah, you should move on
however you want.

851
00:40:18,067 --> 00:40:19,678
I just...

852
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:21,636
You know, I want you
to get what you need.

853
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,073
Y-You, too, Keish.

854
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:26,772
Thank you.

855
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:33,169
Hey, Jess.

856
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:35,345
You, uh, want to grab dinner?

857
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:37,522
No. I mean, maybe.

858
00:40:37,565 --> 00:40:39,262
I, um...

859
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:40,873
I've been reassigned.

860
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:43,702
Wh... Reassigned? Where?

861
00:40:43,745 --> 00:40:44,877
Ypsi Med.

862
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:47,532
Wait,
but if you aren't running things

863
00:40:47,575 --> 00:40:49,098
at the hotel, then who is?

864
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:51,187
Good work.

865
00:40:51,231 --> 00:40:53,451
Everything's
moving forward nicely.

866
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:57,498
But, Mr. Greene, what happens
now that the 4,400 are free?

867
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:06,812
They're not free.

868
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:08,901
They're just in a bigger cage.

869
00:41:14,863 --> 00:41:16,822
We're happy to have you here.

870
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:18,190
I mean, you have
your own bathroom.

871
00:41:18,214 --> 00:41:19,651
And the hot water
takes a minute,

872
00:41:19,694 --> 00:41:21,653
but it gets there eventually.

873
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:25,961
Um, do you need anything else?

874
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:27,659
What else would I need?

875
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:30,270
I don't know. Uh, candy, soda.

876
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:31,576
Nuclear codes?

877
00:41:32,664 --> 00:41:35,014
Sorry. Bad joke.

878
00:41:36,058 --> 00:41:39,801
Um, so, what do you
want to do tomorrow?

879
00:41:39,845 --> 00:41:42,891
We could go see a movie.
Oh, are you into sports?

880
00:41:42,935 --> 00:41:44,197
I could teach you how to fence.

881
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,807
Get you battle-ready in no time.

882
00:41:46,939 --> 00:41:48,984
I know what I'm gonna do.

883
00:41:50,203 --> 00:41:53,075
I'm gonna break Mildred out
of Ypsi Med.
