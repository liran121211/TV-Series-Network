1
00:00:09,113 --> 00:00:11,115
Manny, what are you saying?

2
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:13,335
You're telling me
you're from 2062?

3
00:00:13,465 --> 00:00:15,467
2064.

4
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,340
I spent two years in what
you'd consider the future.

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,472
I don't... That's...

6
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,126
What? I'm here

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,868
because things in the future
are bad, Jha.

8
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:27,044
It's 40 more years
of the rich getting richer

9
00:00:27,218 --> 00:00:28,829
by taking resources
from everybody else.

10
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:30,656
I can't let us stay
on that course.

11
00:00:30,787 --> 00:00:32,707
Okay, so what? Somehow
you make the future better

12
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:34,704
by killing Rev?

13
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:36,856
Not to mention all those
people in danger here today.

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,578
Yes. Because today
always happens.

15
00:00:39,752 --> 00:00:41,798
It happens in every version
of the timeline.

16
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:43,495
Okay, so why don't you stop it?

17
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:44,733
If it wasn't this,
it'd be something else.

18
00:00:44,757 --> 00:00:45,837
It has been something else,

19
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:48,761
over and over again
throughout history.

20
00:00:48,936 --> 00:00:51,242
There is a rot in this country,

21
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,699
people who believe in white
supremacy above everything else.

22
00:00:53,723 --> 00:00:56,378
The system we have now

23
00:00:56,552 --> 00:00:58,249
is cruel to its core.

24
00:00:58,423 --> 00:01:00,271
The sooner we tear it down,
the sooner we can work

25
00:01:00,295 --> 00:01:01,576
towards a better system
in its place.

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,037
We have to start now.

27
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:05,256
So people now have to die?

28
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:08,042
Manny, that can't be the way.

29
00:01:08,172 --> 00:01:10,261
It's the only way.

30
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:20,010
Welcome, Manny Campos.

31
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:33,894
When am I?

32
00:01:35,156 --> 00:01:36,331
The year 2062.

33
00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:39,725
Still Detroit? Yes.

34
00:01:39,856 --> 00:01:41,814
Although you might not
recognize it.

35
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:44,208
Michigan has been declared
a climate haven,

36
00:01:44,382 --> 00:01:47,211
and the population has
exploded in the last decade.

37
00:01:47,385 --> 00:01:48,560
It's been difficult.

38
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:52,608
It's all real.

39
00:01:52,782 --> 00:01:54,392
We had a feeling
you'd catch on quickly.

40
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:56,307
I am Dr. Amber Campbell,

41
00:01:56,438 --> 00:01:58,440
lead scientist
at our foundation.

42
00:01:58,614 --> 00:02:00,311
What do you think of the place?

43
00:02:00,442 --> 00:02:02,879
We have all of this
because of you.

44
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,620
I built this?

45
00:02:04,794 --> 00:02:06,839
No. Sadly, in every version

46
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:09,364
of your future
that we observed, you died

47
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,235
before you could
complete the project.

48
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:12,649
But you did lay the groundwork.

49
00:02:14,543 --> 00:02:17,372
My brother's waiting for me
in 2020.

50
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:19,243
He'll be worried.

51
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:21,134
We are of, course, sorry
to pull you out of your life,

52
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:24,118
but we think you'll agree
it's worthwhile.

53
00:02:25,032 --> 00:02:27,077
But why this me? Why now?

54
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:32,474
Because 2020 Manny is as full
of hope and promise as ever,

55
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:36,347
of understanding the space
between spaces.

56
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,877
And who are you?

57
00:02:45,052 --> 00:02:47,445
I head a team of scientists
dedicated to using

58
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:49,578
this technology in order
to better position

59
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,362
key people in time

60
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:54,713
in order to improve the
welfare of humanity today.

61
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:58,021
But we need your help
honing our vision.

62
00:02:58,152 --> 00:03:02,460
The tech has a number
of limitations,

63
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:04,636
and our experiments
are falling short.

64
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,770
So far, they are not providing
the positive impact

65
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:09,685
the world desperately needs.

66
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:11,817
We believe you're the key
to our success.

67
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,777
Humanity needs you.

68
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:17,780
Will you help us
change the world?

69
00:03:22,393 --> 00:03:24,656
I told you what I was
working on, Jha.

70
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,137
Breaking the fabric of time.

71
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:29,072
The people I was with,
they thought they could

72
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:31,489
make it work in other ways,

73
00:03:31,663 --> 00:03:34,188
tried to make incremental,
agreeable change

74
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:36,494
that they could feel good about.

75
00:03:36,668 --> 00:03:39,019
It doesn't work.

76
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:44,589
It never works.

77
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:49,116
Come on, we need
everyone's help.

78
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,988
Get those chairs over here,
stack them up.

79
00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:04,198
I don't know how much longer
those ropes are gonna hold.

80
00:04:10,354 --> 00:04:12,269
We're ready!
If they want a fight,

81
00:04:12,443 --> 00:04:14,054
we'll give them a fight.

82
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:18,362
Right this way, sir.

83
00:04:18,536 --> 00:04:20,190
I would like
some answers, please.

84
00:04:20,364 --> 00:04:21,844
How about a cup of
tea while you wait?

85
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,020
Earl Grey?

86
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:25,824
I-I thought I was meeting
with the founder of BHN,

87
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,111
Ms. Sienna Stone?

88
00:04:28,242 --> 00:04:30,331
What do you know about
Ms. Stone?

89
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:32,811
She works in technology,
and prides herself

90
00:04:32,985 --> 00:04:34,335
on being against the government.

91
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:35,945
Which I applaud, but...

92
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:38,078
I'm not sure how much
substance there is

93
00:04:38,252 --> 00:04:40,341
beneath the gleaming surface.

94
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:42,035
There's more to her
than meets the eye.

95
00:04:43,344 --> 00:04:44,432
Please.

96
00:04:53,963 --> 00:04:55,138
It's time to save

97
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:57,053
you God-fearing patriots
from these threats

98
00:04:57,184 --> 00:04:59,142
to our way of life.

99
00:04:59,273 --> 00:05:01,057
We are gonna protect
the innocent people

100
00:05:01,188 --> 00:05:03,146
in this country.

101
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:05,409
We should be doing more.
Where are the authorities?

102
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,368
Why isn't Detroit PD
doing something?

103
00:05:07,498 --> 00:05:09,979
We've been liaising
with the DPD the past few days.

104
00:05:10,153 --> 00:05:12,677
They're monitoring the
situation, but they think

105
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:16,203
these outbursts of violence
so far are a few bad apples.

106
00:05:16,377 --> 00:05:18,074
These folks,
they've-they've gotten

107
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:20,598
the appropriate permits
to camp and protest.

108
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:23,427
Come on. Really? DHS is monitoring,
too, all right?

109
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:25,603
We're all over this.
But look.

110
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:30,608
The 4,400 had asked to create
a sanctuary out of the hotel.

111
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:32,871
We have to make sure we don't
violate that in any way.

112
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:34,177
It's tricky.

113
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:36,005
So we do nothing.

114
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:37,615
Their methods may be crude,

115
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:40,444
and we certainly condemn them.
Of course.

116
00:05:40,618 --> 00:05:42,577
But this 44orum group
will ultimately demonstrate

117
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:44,970
that the 4,400
need to be governed.

118
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:46,798
What does that mean? That the world

119
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,366
will see that the 4,400

120
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,238
can't be left
to their own devices.

121
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:53,327
They're going to need us
to step in.

122
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:55,609
And exactly how many casualties
will there be before then?

123
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:57,853
I thought
we were protecting people.

124
00:05:58,027 --> 00:06:00,812
The questions you're asking
come with accountability.

125
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,945
Do you really want that?

126
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:15,479
Damn it, Jessica,
answer the phone.

127
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,779
I think we should get everyone
out through the tunnel

128
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,983
while Mildred holds the doors closed up here.
- No,

129
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,811
that's gonna be impossible. We
went through the tunnel first,

130
00:06:23,835 --> 00:06:26,205
but the 44orumers were right
behind us. We had to cave it in.

131
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:26,925
What?
So we're trapped.

132
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:28,231
You can barricade

133
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:29,426
in the hotel rooms.
Okay.

134
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,495
Okay, everyone, find a room

135
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:33,952
to hide out in. Three or four
of you together. And barricade.

136
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,586
Okay? Quickly!

137
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:37,719
Let's get to the elevators!
Come on. You guys

138
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:39,634
get up to my room;
I'll be right behind you.

139
00:06:39,808 --> 00:06:41,853
What was that?

140
00:06:46,597 --> 00:06:47,816
Is that a battering ram?

141
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:51,080
I'm trying, but I can't...!

142
00:06:51,254 --> 00:06:53,648
Okay, everyone
take cover. Now!

143
00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:11,622
Find the reverend, their leader.

144
00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:14,538
They'll all fall in line
once we have him.

145
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,598
Here's one.

146
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:37,474
No! Hayden!

147
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:38,823
Let him go! Stop!

148
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:42,087
Let go of me.

149
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:47,223
Come on, follow me.

150
00:07:52,576 --> 00:07:54,336
Why are we listening
to this Millicent chick?

151
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:55,797
She's one of them.
We need her

152
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:58,234
in case we got trouble
getting in the hotel.

153
00:07:58,408 --> 00:08:00,212
But she doesn't know
the real plan. We're gonna

154
00:08:00,236 --> 00:08:02,891
round up those iguana-blooded
pieces of 44-filth

155
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:05,285
and bring them right back here
for extermination.

156
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:07,243
Yes. Including her.

157
00:08:07,374 --> 00:08:09,811
Yes! Yeah!

158
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:12,248
We'll take this one

159
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:14,424
with the others.

160
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:16,121
You go get more.
Saw them go that way.

161
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,515
To the elevator. Quick.

162
00:08:21,213 --> 00:08:23,781
What is going on?

163
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:25,977
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry we have
to be those absolute creepers.

164
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:27,176
I'm crawling out of my skin.

165
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,221
Okay, this is freaky,

166
00:08:29,396 --> 00:08:30,895
but not as freaky
as when you were Jessica,

167
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:32,244
I guess. We have to get our people

168
00:08:32,268 --> 00:08:33,550
out of here.
I'd rather take our chances

169
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:35,203
out there instead
of being trapped with them

170
00:08:35,227 --> 00:08:36,640
in here. Let's get everyone
to the tunnel.

171
00:08:36,664 --> 00:08:38,361
No. Manny's people
said it was blocked.

172
00:08:38,535 --> 00:08:40,363
Blocked? No, we need that exit.

173
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:43,061
Yes, we do.
I saw that guy's memory.

174
00:08:43,235 --> 00:08:44,411
They're planning to...

175
00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:46,674
to take us somewhere and...

176
00:08:47,849 --> 00:08:50,155
kill us. No, Lord.

177
00:08:50,286 --> 00:08:52,086
They're in some
burnt-out warehouse somewhere.

178
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:54,072
That's their, like, sad
Mad Maxcosplay lair.

179
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:55,857
I've been there. It's not far.

180
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:57,574
Good. Y'all figure that out.
I'll head to the tunnel.

181
00:08:57,598 --> 00:08:59,010
Even if I have to rip this body
to shreds,

182
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:00,383
I'll get it open for us.

183
00:09:00,514 --> 00:09:00,992
And I'm gonna make sure
Logan and Hayden

184
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,211
are safe in my room.

185
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,030
Pray those monsters haven't
made it to this floor yet.

186
00:09:17,444 --> 00:09:19,271
Oh, I'm ready to roll up

187
00:09:19,446 --> 00:09:20,882
on their camp,
even if that means

188
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:22,797
having to be those dummies
for longer.

189
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:24,755
I can just...
I can just take Mildred,

190
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:27,018
and we can rain holy hell down
on all of them.

191
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,412
No, no,
we can't do anything rash. Rash?

192
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:31,109
No. After everything
they did to me,

193
00:09:31,283 --> 00:09:33,111
to my friends, to my dad?

194
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:34,852
After what they did,

195
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:37,986
I want them to suffer.
I want them dead.

196
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:39,117
Yes, I know the feeling.

197
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:40,858
But anger

198
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:42,904
and violence will only backfire
on all of you.

199
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:44,688
And I know it's wrong,

200
00:09:44,862 --> 00:09:47,343
but if you hurt these people,
you become the problem.

201
00:09:47,517 --> 00:09:48,717
So, what do you want us to do?

202
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,346
I want you
to put that hood back on me

203
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,584
and get us both out
of this hotel.

204
00:09:51,608 --> 00:09:53,262
You go back to their camp,

205
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:54,829
but just to keep watch, okay?

206
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:56,110
Make sure
nothing terrible happens

207
00:09:56,134 --> 00:09:57,374
to the 4,400 they already have.

208
00:09:57,484 --> 00:09:58,876
And where are you going?

209
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,574
I'm going to get backup.

210
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:03,054
I know
you can keep things handled

211
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,404
until I can bring back help.

212
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:06,754
Me? Alone? Yes.

213
00:10:06,928 --> 00:10:10,584
You are as much a leader among
the 4,400 as anybody else.

214
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:12,281
Embrace your power.

215
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:14,979
Fine.

216
00:10:16,894 --> 00:10:18,654
Look, those are my friends
down there, Manny.

217
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,289
Innocent people.
Do you understand?

218
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:23,379
I know, Jha.
And I'm sorry about that.

219
00:10:23,553 --> 00:10:26,382
You're going to have to accept
that many of your friends

220
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:27,794
will not make it
through the day.

221
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:29,516
So you're murdering them?

222
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,343
Why?

223
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:34,390
Because I want to tear
down all the institutions

224
00:10:34,564 --> 00:10:36,392
that maintain the status quo.

225
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:40,178
The many 4,400 who survive
today will be hailed as heroes,

226
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:42,752
but they'll also be vengeful
for the death of their comrades.

227
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:45,053
They'll use their
powers for change.

228
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,969
They'll activate a country that
needs something to believe in!

229
00:10:48,143 --> 00:10:50,667
It shouldn't take people dying
to do that.

230
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:52,930
Thousands of people havedied.

231
00:10:53,104 --> 00:10:55,542
Millions more are suffering.

232
00:10:56,847 --> 00:10:58,196
This?

233
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,329
This is just the start.

234
00:11:04,986 --> 00:11:06,727
I understand

235
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:08,903
what you want to do.

236
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,255
But I don't believe in it.

237
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,300
I just can't.

238
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:18,521
Jharrel, let me out of here!

239
00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:20,332
I can't do that, bro.
I got to try and help

240
00:11:20,392 --> 00:11:22,873
the people I care about
survive the day.

241
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:24,527
Jharrel!

242
00:11:27,965 --> 00:11:29,140
Oh, thank God.

243
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,099
Shanice, come on. Are Logan

244
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:32,816
and Hayden...? Yeah, they're
already inside.

245
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,947
Come with me, and
I'll barricade us in.

246
00:11:33,971 --> 00:11:35,645
Mildred, there's something
you should know.

247
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:37,189
They're gonna turn
against your sister.

248
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:38,430
What? No, she's one
of their leaders.

249
00:11:38,454 --> 00:11:39,977
She's not... They're using her

250
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:41,871
to get inside.
They think she's just like...

251
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:43,415
well, us.

252
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,202
Look, I had to tell you
to give you the choice,

253
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:48,159
but you should stay with us.

254
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,205
She led them in here,

255
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,033
and she can fend for herself.

256
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:54,727
No, she can't. She doesn't even
know. She thinks that they're...

257
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:57,908
Look, it's my fault
that she trusts them,

258
00:11:58,082 --> 00:11:59,320
and it's my fault that she's
put herself in danger.

259
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,259
Mildred, please, stay.

260
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:02,826
I can't just give up on her.

261
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:09,833
Please, be careful.

262
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:11,966
You, too.

263
00:12:13,924 --> 00:12:15,186
Okay.

264
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:20,278
Get the chair.
Put it against the door. Grab this?

265
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:21,715
Yes, yes. All right.

266
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,326
Okay.

267
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:31,551
Oh, my God, Logan.
You're hurt.

268
00:12:33,944 --> 00:12:36,599
It must have happened
during the scuffle or something.

269
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,610
Okay, we-we have to get you
to the hospital. No,

270
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:40,647
no, no,
you-you can't go out that door.

271
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:42,363
It's the only thing that's
keeping us safe right now,

272
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,214
keeping Hayden safe.

273
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,651
We can wait it out.

274
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:46,391
All right, kick the door in!

275
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:48,219
Mr. Kaminski, it-it looks bad.
Hey.

276
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,178
It's gonna be okay. All right?

277
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:02,625
Whoa! Can't stop
every bullet at once.

278
00:13:03,626 --> 00:13:05,759
Take me to Millicent.

279
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:18,423
Oh, thank God. Renee.

280
00:13:18,554 --> 00:13:20,687
You get that tunnel clear?
Best you get upstairs.

281
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:22,166
Help the helpless
to their rooms.

282
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,779
It looks fine. Aren't we

283
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:27,408
trying to get everyone out? Like I said,

284
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,217
you should help the others.

285
00:13:30,784 --> 00:13:32,916
Uh, right.

286
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,440
All right, of course.

287
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:38,661
Claudette. Thank God.
The emergency lines

288
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:40,576
- are jammed.
- I'm running out to...

289
00:13:43,884 --> 00:13:45,233
I think one of Manny's team...

290
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,061
My team...

291
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:49,150
Went rogue.

292
00:13:49,324 --> 00:13:51,605
This right here is a bomb your
brother taught us to build.

293
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:53,894
Let's see.

294
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:55,611
And this looks like a map
showing where more of them

295
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,158
are planted around the hotel.

296
00:13:58,507 --> 00:14:00,335
She didn't go rogue.

297
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:02,076
This is Manny's plan.

298
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,687
To trap the 44orumers in
here and bomb them to hell?

299
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:06,141
Yeah, along with the rest of us.

300
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:08,386
He claims he wants
to tear down everything

301
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,600
so the nation can rebuild.

302
00:14:09,736 --> 00:14:10,519
I heard him talk
that way before,

303
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:12,042
but not about this.

304
00:14:12,173 --> 00:14:14,392
We're supposed to be
defending ourselves.

305
00:14:14,523 --> 00:14:15,742
I don't know. All right?

306
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,371
He claims that he came
from the future.

307
00:14:17,395 --> 00:14:18,745
I don't know what to believe.

308
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,311
It's like
he's not even my brother.

309
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,400
Yeah, well, I got a
few words for him.

310
00:14:22,531 --> 00:14:24,098
But first...

311
00:14:35,413 --> 00:14:36,763
Now come on.

312
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:45,162
Look, I got you, Mr. Kaminski.

313
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:46,947
I don't know why
Andre's not picking up.

314
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:49,558
God, I hope he's okay.

315
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:56,347
It's Mariah. Oh.

316
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,566
Are you okay?

317
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,437
Is Dad okay? Are you safe?

318
00:14:59,568 --> 00:15:02,092
We're-we're safe
for now. Uh,

319
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:03,050
we're trapped in the hotel at the moment.
- Give me your hand.

320
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:04,224
But, Mariah,

321
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:06,183
be-be careful.

322
00:15:06,357 --> 00:15:08,882
They know your face, too,
from the Meet the 4,400 Event.

323
00:15:09,012 --> 00:15:10,797
Where's Dad?
He's-he's not picking up.Hey.

324
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:12,799
Hey, Ri. Hey.

325
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:14,801
You look funny. Are you...

326
00:15:14,975 --> 00:15:16,541
What? Feeling better
now that I see

327
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:18,587
that beautiful face?
You better believe it.

328
00:15:18,761 --> 00:15:20,676
Oh, Dad.

329
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:22,678
Hey, Hayden.

330
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:24,854
How you hanging in there?

331
00:15:25,028 --> 00:15:28,031
Really wish I had my
getaway driver right about now.

332
00:15:28,205 --> 00:15:29,729
Hey, hey. It's too soon,

333
00:15:29,903 --> 00:15:31,426
Hayden. Too soon.

334
00:15:36,257 --> 00:15:38,128
Listen,

335
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:39,819
I-I've done
enough active shooter drills

336
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:41,175
at school. They-they might help.

337
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:43,394
Um, I'm sure you guys
have already done this,

338
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:44,720
but make sure
that your phones are on silent.

339
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,397
And they usually come in firing,

340
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,226
so make sure that no one's
in front of the door.

341
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,751
And, um, don't move
any of the wounded.

342
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:53,622
Are any of you hurt?

343
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:56,712
No. No.

344
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,193
And...

345
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:01,978
lastly,
we have to get off this phone.

346
00:16:03,284 --> 00:16:07,418
Hey, I'm so proud of you, Ri.

347
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,769
I know.

348
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:11,248
We're gonna get out of this.

349
00:16:11,422 --> 00:16:13,816
Okay, Mariah?
We-We'll see you soon.

350
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,426
I love you.

351
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,777
Love you, too. Love you.

352
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:25,610
Hey. Hey.

353
00:16:33,836 --> 00:16:35,403
Ms. Stone apologizes
for the delay.

354
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,753
Something's come up

355
00:16:37,927 --> 00:16:39,450
that requires
her immediate attention.

356
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,888
Well, then take me
back. All I asked for

357
00:16:42,062 --> 00:16:43,300
is supplies to help
me with my research,

358
00:16:43,324 --> 00:16:44,847
not some wild-goose chase.

359
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:49,025
May I?

360
00:16:57,425 --> 00:16:59,122
Your ZMT levels
are about where we'd expect

361
00:16:59,296 --> 00:17:01,255
for a 4,400.Wait.

362
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:03,431
This measures...

363
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:05,061
How did you know? That you're interested

364
00:17:05,085 --> 00:17:06,695
in ZMT? Well,

365
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,262
yes.

366
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:11,091
And how do you possess
this technology

367
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:13,920
that exists nowhere in
the research I've done?

368
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:15,747
Sienna Stone.

369
00:17:15,922 --> 00:17:18,750
I'm sure she'd be fascinated
to know your power.

370
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:20,840
It has manifested, hasn't it?

371
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:24,626
Still want to head back?

372
00:17:27,455 --> 00:17:29,892
I'm glad you came. Sorry I
haven't been answering...

373
00:17:30,023 --> 00:17:31,623
Why the hell isn't DHS
helping the 4,400?

374
00:17:31,763 --> 00:17:33,156
This is domestic terrorism,

375
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,984
and you know damn well
law enforcement

376
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:36,309
would be all over this
if those people

377
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,205
looked more like me. I know. I know.

378
00:17:38,379 --> 00:17:40,313
I just don't know what I can
do. Call in the National Guard.

379
00:17:40,337 --> 00:17:41,730
There's protocol and red tape,

380
00:17:41,904 --> 00:17:42,687
and technically,
Bill has to sign off on...

381
00:17:42,818 --> 00:17:43,471
So we go over his head!

382
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,689
I'll reach out

383
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,343
to every contact I have at DPD,

384
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:47,797
and I'll give
anyone who needs it

385
00:17:47,954 --> 00:17:49,694
a firsthand account from inside.

386
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:52,828
We have to do whatever we can,

387
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,047
Jess.

388
00:17:54,221 --> 00:17:55,483
I...

389
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:59,052
You're right. We do.

390
00:17:59,182 --> 00:18:01,054
I do.

391
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:07,756
What else did you hide from me?

392
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,125
I never would have been
party to planting bombs

393
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:10,715
that could kill innocent people.

394
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:12,345
Which is exactly
why I didn't tell you.

395
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:14,067
You were ready for a lot,

396
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:15,914
but you weren't prepared
to make that sacrifice.

397
00:18:15,938 --> 00:18:17,374
Even though you know

398
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:18,985
this is how real change happens.

399
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:20,638
With a body count?

400
00:18:20,812 --> 00:18:24,642
If there were 50 police murders
in a day,

401
00:18:24,816 --> 00:18:27,341
if there was
a school shooting every day,

402
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:28,908
do you think

403
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:31,736
people would still
be able to look away?

404
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:33,714
Would people still think
that we could solve things

405
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,436
by making nice?

406
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,742
You're destroying a sanctuary,
Manny.

407
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,353
All right? People came here

408
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:41,529
to feel safe. They were never safe.

409
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:44,019
You know I agree on that, but
you're talking about making it

410
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,621
even less so. These
are my friends.

411
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:50,190
People I care about.
People that are only doing good.

412
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:52,366
But this is
how they do the most good.

413
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:55,847
To summarize our latest trial,

414
00:18:56,022 --> 00:19:00,678
in which we sent 2,547 people
to 2021,

415
00:19:00,852 --> 00:19:03,333
we are definitely
seeing improvements.

416
00:19:03,464 --> 00:19:06,032
Poverty came down
by one eighth of a percent,

417
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:08,686
and the Latinx population
showed some political gains.

418
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,688
So, if we continue to augment

419
00:19:10,862 --> 00:19:12,492
the number of returnees...
We've run the experiment

420
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:14,475
over 30 times.

421
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:16,346
We should have created

422
00:19:16,477 --> 00:19:18,783
a whole new world by now,
but everything is the same.

423
00:19:18,914 --> 00:19:20,220
Well, in our next trial,

424
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:23,005
we anticipate a 16% increase

425
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:24,591
in the possibility... It's not enough!

426
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:26,791
None of it is!

427
00:19:26,922 --> 00:19:28,663
We sit here all day
in this pristine office,

428
00:19:28,837 --> 00:19:31,231
acting as if the world outside
doesn't exist.

429
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:33,537
But it does.

430
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:38,064
The majority of the country
is nearly uninhabitable.

431
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:39,718
Are the so-called leaders
in this room

432
00:19:39,891 --> 00:19:41,589
actually fighting
for fundamental change?

433
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:43,591
Or just enough
to maintain your status quo?

434
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,855
We are trying to help.

435
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:49,075
We are trying to give back

436
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:50,990
out of the goodness
of our hearts.

437
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:52,382
We are not doing nothing.

438
00:19:52,513 --> 00:19:55,646
Except maybe weare the problem.

439
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,388
Because we keep doing
the bare minimum.

440
00:19:58,562 --> 00:20:00,410
Just enough to say that we've
done something to help others

441
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:03,089
without actually hurting
ourselves.

442
00:20:03,263 --> 00:20:05,830
Would actually change... No. No.

443
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:07,591
It's too drastic, and
the outcome is too uncertain.

444
00:20:07,615 --> 00:20:09,312
Look...

445
00:20:09,486 --> 00:20:13,055
Change takes time, Manny.

446
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:16,015
Well, that's just another way
of saying "wait your turn."

447
00:20:16,189 --> 00:20:17,842
It will take

448
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:20,410
painful, harsh sacrifices
in order

449
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,891
for people to wake up and see
how bad things truly are.

450
00:20:24,675 --> 00:20:26,982
What you're talking about

451
00:20:27,113 --> 00:20:29,637
is a massacre.

452
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:32,031
And it's necessary.

453
00:20:32,205 --> 00:20:34,207
I wish change could come
some other way.

454
00:20:34,337 --> 00:20:35,947
But I know

455
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:39,299
in my heart...
You know in yours, too...

456
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:41,475
That it won't.

457
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:42,780
There has to be another way.

458
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:44,314
I thought you were
here to help us.

459
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:46,219
I amhelping!

460
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:50,223
I'm sad you can't see that.

461
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,708
Evacuate the premises.

462
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,931
Hey!

463
00:21:24,605 --> 00:21:26,824
If you try anything,

464
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:28,304
I will make your sister suffer.

465
00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:30,045
And the rest of you!

466
00:21:30,176 --> 00:21:32,613
But I'm on your side.

467
00:21:32,787 --> 00:21:34,136
I can talk to Bill Greene.

468
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,573
We don't care about Bill Greene.

469
00:21:36,704 --> 00:21:38,290
The government can't save us.
We're taking our country back.

470
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:39,576
But...

471
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,622
Stop it, Millie. They're insane.

472
00:21:41,796 --> 00:21:43,469
They're not going to listen
to you. Why can't you

473
00:21:43,493 --> 00:21:45,452
see that? All of you, stop talking!

474
00:21:46,844 --> 00:21:48,977
It's time to take care
of business,

475
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:51,110
make an example out of you.

476
00:21:51,284 --> 00:21:53,764
Go! Up!

477
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,332
Millie! Please, stop! Take me!
- Let go of me!

478
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,299
The whole world's
gonna see this.

479
00:22:06,473 --> 00:22:08,518
We got our first one
coming out now!

480
00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:10,520
Bet she bleeds green.

481
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:21,270
Okay, LaDonna. You can do this.

482
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:25,231
Hey! Let go of me!

483
00:22:26,841 --> 00:22:28,930
What are you doing?
I'm on your side!

484
00:22:29,104 --> 00:22:31,411
Please!
Let go of me!

485
00:22:33,021 --> 00:22:34,457
Don't do this!

486
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:40,811
Stop!

487
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,162
These racist,
fear-mongering scum can eat it.

488
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:47,557
Don't do this!

489
00:22:47,688 --> 00:22:51,126
Hey. Hey!

490
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:13,409
- What's happening?
- Let me out of here!

491
00:23:29,947 --> 00:23:31,360
- Come on, arm up!
- Let's get out there!

492
00:23:31,384 --> 00:23:33,037
- What's going on?
- What is happening?

493
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,126
What the hell is that?

494
00:23:35,301 --> 00:23:36,365
Where did you take my sister?
- Get out there,

495
00:23:36,389 --> 00:23:38,260
see what's going on. I'm on your side.

496
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,376
Hey! What the hell's going on?

497
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,663
Don't try anything.

498
00:23:49,837 --> 00:23:52,579
If you do, you're gonna
have to deal with them.

499
00:23:52,753 --> 00:23:55,930
And we remember what you did
to us at the Bois Blanc.

500
00:24:26,613 --> 00:24:28,571
Come on.

501
00:24:28,745 --> 00:24:30,443
LaDonna's distracting them.
We can get

502
00:24:30,573 --> 00:24:32,140
everyone else to safety.

503
00:24:32,314 --> 00:24:33,097
If we work together, we can make

504
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:34,712
an unstoppable team,
don't you think?

505
00:24:34,882 --> 00:24:37,145
I-I can't, Millie.

506
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,668
Please.

507
00:24:38,842 --> 00:24:40,409
I'm sorry. No!

508
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,585
Wait!

509
00:24:42,716 --> 00:24:44,239
Millie!

510
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:26,325
Manny left.

511
00:25:30,372 --> 00:25:32,200
You okay? Yeah.

512
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,203
We have to stop him.

513
00:25:36,378 --> 00:25:37,901
What are you thinking?

514
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:39,729
Your hand?

515
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,340
I've never tried
something so drastic.

516
00:25:41,514 --> 00:25:43,820
There's 27 bones
in here, and-and...

517
00:25:43,951 --> 00:25:45,581
I'd have to crush almost
every single one of them.

518
00:25:45,605 --> 00:25:46,605
Wait. Just...

519
00:25:46,736 --> 00:25:48,651
wait.

520
00:25:48,825 --> 00:25:50,020
Look, since we don't know
what's gonna happen, I...

521
00:25:50,044 --> 00:25:51,654
There's no time for
speeches, Jharrel.

522
00:25:51,828 --> 00:25:54,265
Look, I-I know
you've come to care for me

523
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,399
in a far kinder way than the
man I left behind in 1958.

524
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,880
Okay, that's it.
We-we get out of this,

525
00:26:00,054 --> 00:26:01,664
and I am taking
you Feather Bowling.

526
00:26:01,838 --> 00:26:03,278
All right?
We're gonna do this right.

527
00:26:03,405 --> 00:26:06,365
You already did
everything right.

528
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:22,424
Hey. Hey. Claudette.

529
00:26:22,598 --> 00:26:24,121
Stay with me, okay?

530
00:26:24,252 --> 00:26:26,602
All right, you can do this.

531
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:40,660
You are... Oh, come on.

532
00:26:42,313 --> 00:26:43,833
You can tell me how
amazing I am later.

533
00:26:55,283 --> 00:26:56,850
Stop.

534
00:26:57,024 --> 00:26:58,417
Right there.

535
00:27:04,466 --> 00:27:06,444
Okay, we have to tell everyone
that there are bombs

536
00:27:06,468 --> 00:27:07,576
in the building. No, Jharrel. We have

537
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,273
to stop your brother
from setting them off.

538
00:27:09,297 --> 00:27:10,603
Whoa! Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh!

539
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:14,520
You cut the tail off an iguana,
it grows back.

540
00:27:14,694 --> 00:27:16,783
You cut off the head,

541
00:27:16,957 --> 00:27:19,176
problem solved. Okay,
do you think you can...?

542
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,198
Decapitation?
No, I don't think so. You're the problem.

543
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,137
All of you

544
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:25,661
are the problem, and I'm
gonna protect my country.

545
00:27:25,835 --> 00:27:27,489
Okay, hey, hey, hey,
I get how you feel.

546
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,100
Shut up.
I'm putting this beast down.

547
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:33,713
Manny, we found a way

548
00:27:33,887 --> 00:27:34,907
to call in the National Guard,

549
00:27:34,931 --> 00:27:36,150
and they're on their way.

550
00:27:36,324 --> 00:27:37,978
Okay? We'll be safe soon.

551
00:27:40,197 --> 00:27:42,591
Have you ever felt safe?

552
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:50,338
Which is why I say
more the merrier.

553
00:27:52,122 --> 00:27:55,125
Let the 4,400 achieve
their true potential.

554
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,779
No, there's no way

555
00:27:56,953 --> 00:27:59,869
that's the reason
the 4,400 were sent here.

556
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,089
Well,

557
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,309
at least we agree on that.

558
00:28:13,187 --> 00:28:14,884
Manny, please step away.

559
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,235
Look, I understand

560
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:20,107
you are frustrated
by the process...

561
00:28:20,237 --> 00:28:23,110
but we have 4,400 subjects

562
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,546
in trial. If you
insert yourself,

563
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,592
you'll compromise
the whole thing.

564
00:28:26,766 --> 00:28:29,116
The trial was compromised
from inception.

565
00:28:29,246 --> 00:28:30,944
Nothing ever changes!

566
00:28:31,118 --> 00:28:33,207
Until now.

567
00:28:33,381 --> 00:28:35,688
You will ruin everything
we've worked for.

568
00:28:35,818 --> 00:28:37,472
No. No.

569
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:39,822
I'm finally gonna
make things right.

570
00:28:41,258 --> 00:28:42,608
Manny! No!

571
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:55,751
Should we bring him
back to the bed? No.

572
00:28:55,925 --> 00:28:57,753
Mariah said we shouldn't
move the wounded.

573
00:28:59,146 --> 00:29:01,322
I'm sure help is on the way.

574
00:29:01,496 --> 00:29:03,280
Hayden.

575
00:29:03,411 --> 00:29:05,108
Bud.

576
00:29:06,414 --> 00:29:08,982
You're very special to me,
you know that?

577
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:14,869
You got to take care of Mariah,
all right, bud?

578
00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:23,910
Shanice.

579
00:29:27,261 --> 00:29:30,612
No, stay... Stay-stay
with me, Logan.

580
00:29:30,786 --> 00:29:33,572
Okay, please don't leave me.

581
00:29:33,746 --> 00:29:36,749
I never wanted to leave you.

582
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:39,665
I love you.

583
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:42,363
I love you.

584
00:29:46,062 --> 00:29:47,324
Please.

585
00:29:49,457 --> 00:29:50,937
You're not gonna kill me.

586
00:29:52,852 --> 00:29:55,550
Leave Jharrel like
your sister's killer left you.

587
00:29:55,681 --> 00:29:57,596
Heartbroken.

588
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,511
Hateful. Well,

589
00:30:00,686 --> 00:30:04,254
clearly, you don't know me
or your brother at all.

590
00:30:07,693 --> 00:30:09,172
And you don't know me.

591
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:29,889
Do it, dude.

592
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:42,597
They're crazy.

593
00:30:42,728 --> 00:30:44,512
Let's get the hell out of here.

594
00:30:44,686 --> 00:30:46,166
Are you okay? Yeah.

595
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,534
Keep the weapon.
We have no time to lose.

596
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:49,299
We have to get to the tunnel.

597
00:30:51,084 --> 00:30:53,173
I'm gonna have to get
out of here, Hayden.

598
00:30:53,347 --> 00:30:54,914
I have to find help.

599
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:57,220
He's still breathing.

600
00:30:57,394 --> 00:30:58,831
Hayden?

601
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,074
Where's Manny?

602
00:31:25,205 --> 00:31:26,423
Jharrel...

603
00:31:30,297 --> 00:31:32,342
I'm so sorry.

604
00:31:37,957 --> 00:31:40,699
Cops hit our camp.
Means they're on their way.

605
00:31:40,873 --> 00:31:42,570
So it's time for us to kill

606
00:31:42,744 --> 00:31:44,093
all the 'guanas we can hunt.

607
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:45,660
We have names.

608
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,228
And you all are trespassing.

609
00:31:58,891 --> 00:32:00,588
One move,

610
00:32:00,762 --> 00:32:02,155
and you kill yourselves.

611
00:32:04,635 --> 00:32:06,594
This is the National Guard.

612
00:32:06,768 --> 00:32:08,465
We're coming in.
Put down your weapons.

613
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:26,005
Can you believe they
let this place stay a sanctuary?

614
00:32:26,135 --> 00:32:27,373
The video I posted
of their camp went viral.

615
00:32:27,397 --> 00:32:28,837
They-they thought
they'd be glorified

616
00:32:28,877 --> 00:32:30,923
for showing a 4,400 execution,

617
00:32:31,053 --> 00:32:33,621
but now we're heroes
for shutting them down.

618
00:32:33,795 --> 00:32:36,189
Hmm. Maybe the tide's turning?

619
00:32:36,363 --> 00:32:38,844
Well, the thing about tides
is they turn back.

620
00:32:39,018 --> 00:32:40,715
You still bummed about Millicent

621
00:32:40,889 --> 00:32:42,891
throwing your sisterly kindness
in your face?

622
00:32:43,065 --> 00:32:44,632
I don't really see it like that.

623
00:32:44,806 --> 00:32:47,243
I wanted to save her. And I did.

624
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:49,289
I'm not her keeper,
like Caleb was.

625
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:50,594
Or Bill Greene.

626
00:32:52,683 --> 00:32:53,748
Who reached out to me,
by the way.

627
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,164
He said he wants

628
00:32:55,295 --> 00:32:56,949
to know how the government
can help us.

629
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:59,560
Wow. Very bold, Billy Boy.

630
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:01,605
Yeah.

631
00:33:01,736 --> 00:33:02,563
I would not be surprised

632
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:04,608
if Millicent went back to him.

633
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:06,045
But also for us.

634
00:33:06,219 --> 00:33:08,525
They may not have done this,

635
00:33:08,699 --> 00:33:12,268
but they certainly
let it happen.

636
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,533
And what if they try to trigger
the conservatorships again?

637
00:33:16,707 --> 00:33:18,666
Keep your enemies close.

638
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,712
I feel that.

639
00:33:21,887 --> 00:33:24,280
Speaking of, I've-I've been
thinking about reaching out

640
00:33:24,454 --> 00:33:28,894
to maybe-frenemy Sienna Stone
and BHN.

641
00:33:29,068 --> 00:33:32,114
I don't know, I just have
a lot of ideas about

642
00:33:32,288 --> 00:33:34,769
how we can rebuild
and rebrand this hotel.

643
00:33:34,943 --> 00:33:36,640
Wow. You're gonna
take that on?

644
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:38,207
Well, I'm a leader, Millie.

645
00:33:39,992 --> 00:33:41,672
Besides, some girl on a poster
once told me

646
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:44,866
to embrace my power.

647
00:33:45,867 --> 00:33:47,260
Oh, me? Uh, yeah.

648
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:58,445
I tried to find you.

649
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,707
We were being debriefed

650
00:33:59,881 --> 00:34:01,840
by DHS all night.

651
00:34:02,797 --> 00:34:04,320
You-You're leaving?

652
00:34:04,494 --> 00:34:06,496
I have to, Andre.

653
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,498
A-All of your texts and messages

654
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:11,893
flooded in after I left
that damn mansion.

655
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:13,808
I cannot apologize enough

656
00:34:13,982 --> 00:34:16,376
for being absent
for yesterday's nightmares.

657
00:34:16,506 --> 00:34:18,508
No, it... it's okay.

658
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,684
It's... None of it
was your fault, okay?

659
00:34:20,815 --> 00:34:22,948
I need to get to Mariah.

660
00:34:23,122 --> 00:34:24,601
Bridget is-is stranded
out of town,

661
00:34:24,775 --> 00:34:27,561
and it-it's too much
for Mrs. Grover to deal with.

662
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:29,258
Uh, d-does she know about...?

663
00:34:29,432 --> 00:34:31,043
Logan?

664
00:34:33,436 --> 00:34:35,221
No.

665
00:34:37,484 --> 00:34:40,574
And how am I gonna tell her?

666
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:42,837
I dragged them into this,

667
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:46,275
and now I'm gonna ruin
her life all over again.

668
00:34:46,406 --> 00:34:47,949
We-we don't know
what the green light means.

669
00:34:47,973 --> 00:34:49,409
Maybe it saves us in death.

670
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:52,499
Really, Andre? Has it saved us?

671
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:55,284
I-I don't think we know.

672
00:34:55,415 --> 00:34:57,547
Did BHN or Sienna Stone
offer you anything

673
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,288
to help you figure it out?

674
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,901
Are we any closer
than where we were

675
00:35:03,075 --> 00:35:04,685
when we landed on Belle Isle?

676
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,081
No. I suppose not.

677
00:35:11,953 --> 00:35:13,563
Shanice, what can,
what can I do?

678
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,261
How-how can I help?

679
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,622
You have been my rock

680
00:35:28,796 --> 00:35:31,538
through all of this
and y-you mean the world to me.

681
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:37,239
But I don't want to try to
figure this out anymore.

682
00:35:39,546 --> 00:35:43,811
For me, the green lights
have ruined everything,

683
00:35:43,985 --> 00:35:46,379
and I just need to-to get back

684
00:35:46,553 --> 00:35:47,597
to-to...

685
00:35:48,598 --> 00:35:49,817
I don't know. I-I...

686
00:35:49,991 --> 00:35:51,601
I need to get away
from all of this.

687
00:35:53,212 --> 00:35:54,039
From me?

688
00:35:54,213 --> 00:35:56,302
No.

689
00:35:57,912 --> 00:35:59,392
I mean, I-I don't know.

690
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:22,545
Welcome, Andre Davis.

691
00:36:24,112 --> 00:36:26,158
In 40 years, there'll be
a time machine in here.

692
00:36:26,288 --> 00:36:29,422
Ms. Stone. At last.

693
00:36:29,596 --> 00:36:32,294
A pleasure to finally meet you,
Dr. Davis.

694
00:36:32,468 --> 00:36:34,862
I thought the green lights
were our time machine.

695
00:36:36,037 --> 00:36:38,735
You can think of those
as planes.

696
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:42,522
And our machine
like air traffic control.

697
00:36:42,696 --> 00:36:45,568
Except that a stowaway
helped destroy the tower.

698
00:36:45,742 --> 00:36:47,048
Manny.

699
00:36:48,441 --> 00:36:50,530
That is exactly
why I brought you here.

700
00:36:50,704 --> 00:36:52,184
You don't miss a thing.

701
00:36:52,314 --> 00:36:54,751
Except for the reason
you have brought me here.

702
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:58,190
I would like to offer you a job.

703
00:36:58,364 --> 00:37:00,757
With my resource and your brain,
we can have

704
00:37:00,931 --> 00:37:03,369
a time machine in here years
before anyone thinks we can.

705
00:37:05,066 --> 00:37:06,763
Humanity needs you.

706
00:37:06,937 --> 00:37:09,114
Will you help us
change the world?

707
00:37:10,637 --> 00:37:12,421
We can offer on-site housing,

708
00:37:12,595 --> 00:37:16,251
limitless funding, so you can
dream as big as you want.

709
00:37:16,425 --> 00:37:18,471
Thank you, Ms. Stone.

710
00:37:18,645 --> 00:37:21,213
I d... I don't know what to say.

711
00:37:21,387 --> 00:37:23,693
Uh, the housing
will be unnecessary.

712
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,000
And my colleagues
will be excited to learn

713
00:37:26,174 --> 00:37:27,915
that I am formally on the path

714
00:37:28,089 --> 00:37:29,569
to answering questions
we all have.

715
00:37:29,743 --> 00:37:31,266
About that.

716
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,573
You accept my offer,
no one can know.

717
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:35,878
It's nothing sinister.

718
00:37:35,966 --> 00:37:37,359
It's just...

719
00:37:37,533 --> 00:37:39,883
We're dealing with time,
Dr. Davis.

720
00:37:40,014 --> 00:37:41,798
We've learned that a butterfly

721
00:37:41,972 --> 00:37:44,149
flapping its wings has
no effect on the future.

722
00:37:44,323 --> 00:37:47,021
But 4,400 butterflies?

723
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:49,893
Monarchs who've migrated
through time?

724
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:51,591
Well,

725
00:37:51,765 --> 00:37:53,984
it threatens
to destabilize everything.

726
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,728
You're asking me to lie
to those I care about.

727
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:02,689
No, I am asking to wait
until you know the truth.

728
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:05,561
Take the night.

729
00:38:05,735 --> 00:38:09,174
I think when you return
to the Bois Blanc,

730
00:38:09,348 --> 00:38:11,176
you'll see the merit
in my offer.

731
00:38:26,974 --> 00:38:28,214
Glad you had a change of heart.

732
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:32,501
In truth, it wasn't
my heart that changed,

733
00:38:32,632 --> 00:38:34,373
but everything else did.

734
00:38:34,547 --> 00:38:36,375
Perhaps you knew it would.

735
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:39,813
You could only know about

736
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:41,095
that time machine
from the future

737
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,296
if you were from said future.

738
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,733
Did you keep me here yesterday
for a reason?

739
00:38:46,863 --> 00:38:48,952
The attack on the hotel
was always

740
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,346
quite grim for you, Dr. Davis.

741
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:53,696
In all our trials.

742
00:38:56,351 --> 00:38:58,658
What matters is you're here now.

743
00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:02,357
Ready to get to work?

744
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:17,633
I don't even want
to hear it, okay?

745
00:39:17,764 --> 00:39:19,983
I know it took me too long
to do the right thing,

746
00:39:20,114 --> 00:39:22,179
but I know it was the right
thing because I got fired.

747
00:39:22,203 --> 00:39:23,987
Jess.

748
00:39:24,118 --> 00:39:24,945
The 4,400 were clearly
the victims in that situation,

749
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,295
and Bill just didn't care.

750
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:28,340
It's as if he wanted
to see what, like,

751
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,037
the 4,400's threshold was,
just to see

752
00:39:30,211 --> 00:39:31,291
how much they could handle.

753
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,999
What? What happened?

754
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,352
Jharrel will never forgive me.

755
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:46,445
And I don't think
I can forgive myself.

756
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:06,726
Thanks.Yeah.

757
00:40:08,684 --> 00:40:11,339
I spent a year coming here.

758
00:40:11,513 --> 00:40:13,883
Seeing this place for all the
good things that my brother was,

759
00:40:13,907 --> 00:40:14,907
when all along...

760
00:40:14,951 --> 00:40:17,606
I'm so sorry, Jharrel.

761
00:40:17,737 --> 00:40:21,697
That he's gone and he didn't
see fit to trust any of us.

762
00:40:21,871 --> 00:40:23,917
That my last memory of him
was raving like a lunatic

763
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:25,919
about letting us die.

764
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:28,530
I mean,

765
00:40:28,704 --> 00:40:30,504
thank God the National Guard
got there in time

766
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:32,142
to disarm those bombs.

767
00:40:32,317 --> 00:40:33,468
If any of them had gone off...

768
00:40:33,492 --> 00:40:35,058
I don't think he was a lunatic.

769
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:40,542
The sun's only come up once
since what's happened,

770
00:40:40,716 --> 00:40:42,076
and the government's
already acting

771
00:40:42,152 --> 00:40:43,458
like it's another crisis
averted.

772
00:40:43,632 --> 00:40:45,155
Another date
that will ring the bell,

773
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,570
but bring about no real change.

774
00:40:46,722 --> 00:40:48,942
Wait. How can you say that?

775
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:50,944
Public sentiment has changed.

776
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:53,076
Donations for the
4,400 are pouring in.

777
00:40:53,207 --> 00:40:55,688
Yeah, guilt flows freely
into an open wound.

778
00:40:57,298 --> 00:40:58,995
Just give it a few months.

779
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:02,172
Until the next hurricane.

780
00:41:02,347 --> 00:41:05,175
Police shooting.
Pandemic.

781
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,656
See where the guilt heads then.

782
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,659
Jharrel.

783
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:13,009
I think Manny was right

784
00:41:13,183 --> 00:41:14,707
about what's needed.

785
00:41:19,755 --> 00:41:20,843
Uhp.

786
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,848
I leave for a half hour
and you invite a girl over?

787
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:32,115
What the hell happened
to my place?
