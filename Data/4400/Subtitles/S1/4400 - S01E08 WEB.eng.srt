1
00:00:08,356 --> 00:00:10,271
Wow, you weren't lying.

2
00:00:10,314 --> 00:00:12,012
There's a whole
BestTime section.

3
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:14,231
I still say the Sours
are the only way to go.

4
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:16,842
Uh-uh, no. The original
BestTime Bars are aces.

5
00:00:16,886 --> 00:00:18,409
Okay, well, then, uh,

6
00:00:18,453 --> 00:00:20,542
we'll just get both
for the trip. How's that?

7
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:22,674
Mm. You're gonna love
Niagara Falls, Hayden.

8
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:24,328
The fresh air, the mist.

9
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:26,722
Oh, just maybe go easy
on the road trip games, Dad.

10
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:28,332
Ooh.Wow.

11
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:30,682
Oh, no, I-it's okay.
I love games.

12
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:33,424
And my mom always wanted
to take me there,

13
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:35,557
so thank you all.

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,037
Sure.

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,995
Oh, my God, Hayden,

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,258
I have to show you all
the ice cream flavors. Come on.

17
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:42,781
Uh, yeah.

18
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:47,612
We made the right call
taking him in.Yeah.

19
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:52,617
It's nonstop publicity for them.

20
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:56,056
Like Detroit doesn't have
other concerns.

21
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:58,058
Oh, come on, Bridge.

22
00:00:58,101 --> 00:00:59,537
You know,
not everyone's like us.

23
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:00,906
I mean, some of the guys
on my crew

24
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,192
want nothing to do with them.

25
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:05,674
I am so glad we're
getting out of town.

26
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:07,632
Everything's set
for Mariah's school, right?

27
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:11,027
Logan.

28
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,116
You owe her nothing.

29
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,076
Shanice is her biological
mother, Bridge.

30
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:18,439
Who wants to be a part of her
daughter's life, might I add.

31
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:20,602
It doesn't mean she needs
to sign every form.

32
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:22,884
But she doesn't... Especially one
allowing Mariah to miss a week of school.

33
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:24,693
She doesn't need to, but...

34
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,434
But you want her to.

35
00:01:29,393 --> 00:01:31,613
It's not "want," Bridge, it's...

36
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:37,488
Look, I don't know, but...

37
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:40,274
I can't pretend like
she's not a part of this.

38
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:46,584
The mayor is so appreciative
you're willing to host

39
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:48,412
the Meet the 4,400 event.

40
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:51,328
We really feel the 4,400
and their whole story

41
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:53,809
are a boon to Detroit, and
we want the world to know it.

42
00:01:53,852 --> 00:01:55,767
Hey, we are an open book here.

43
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:56,811
Right, Jharrel?

44
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:00,990
Besides, with my office
right up there,

45
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:02,731
I am guaranteed

46
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:05,690
a front-row seat to a
Gladys Keller interview.

47
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:08,476
Live and in action.

48
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:10,521
How'd you land her, anyway?

49
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:12,610
Well, we had a number
of outlets reaching out,

50
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:14,632
but the mayor really wanted
to give it to a Detroit native.

51
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,962
4,400's response
has been good, too.

52
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:18,399
Turns out a lot of them

53
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:20,116
are really into telling
their side of the story.

54
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,186
Speaking of, I have a new
addition to the lineup.

55
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:25,971
But we need to vet them.

56
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:27,775
I'll have my assistant
send over my addition.

57
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:30,237
See you guys mañana.

58
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:36,852
You don't like him.

59
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:41,639
Okay, when have I ever
liked the powers that be?

60
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:44,468
It's more than that.

61
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:47,558
Okay, yes, you're right, but...

62
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:49,125
I don't know, the...

63
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,040
I just want this whole thing
to go well.

64
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,911
Well,

65
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:54,478
I've been thinking about a way

66
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:56,282
to really show the public
there's nothing to fear.

67
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:57,481
Show them

68
00:02:57,525 --> 00:03:00,310
a true 4,400, non-4,400

69
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:02,007
blended family.

70
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:04,140
Make it clear they're
just like you and me.

71
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:06,969
Wait, Shanice?

72
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:09,537
And her husband's
family that took inNo...

73
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,278
a 4,400 as well.No.

74
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:14,237
They're the perfect, beautiful,
multiracial poster family

75
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:16,196
that's really gonna
sell this thing.

76
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,240
I don't know.

77
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:20,025
I mean, it's... complicated.

78
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:22,593
And asking Shanice
to go along with it

79
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:24,291
isn't exactly a picnic, either.

80
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:26,597
I can come with you to talk
to Shanice if you want.

81
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,260
For your big interview?

82
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:40,089
Watched some video
on this Gladys Keller,

83
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:42,047
she's got a silver tongue
that trips people up.

84
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:45,486
Does that make you
the pot or the kettle?

85
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,357
Something on your mind, Shanice?

86
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:49,490
Any particular reason
you're helping Bill Greene

87
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,318
trick our fellow 4,400

88
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:53,407
into signing these
predatory contracts?

89
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,583
It's a standard agreement. It's not.

90
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:56,932
It allows the government

91
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:58,281
to trigger conservatorships

92
00:03:58,325 --> 00:03:59,500
over everyone who signs

93
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:01,023
if certain "conditions"

94
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:03,112
are met.

95
00:04:03,155 --> 00:04:04,896
What happened to our sanctuary?

96
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:07,551
Instead, you are
backing his play

97
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:09,423
to take away
your followers' rights.

98
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:11,599
He's kept his word.

99
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,905
Conditions here are good.
People are happy.

100
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:16,081
Bill is lying to your face.

101
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:19,041
They know we have powers.

102
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:21,739
And whether you want
to believe me or not,

103
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:23,567
I am pretty sure
they're gonna find a way

104
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:25,308
to use them against us.

105
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,919
So, if you are planning
another public spectacle,

106
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:29,965
maybe keep that in mind.

107
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,330
You okay?

108
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:49,767
It's nothing.

109
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:51,856
I just couldn't sleep, so...

110
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,423
trying to tire myself out.

111
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:55,338
Come on, Logan.

112
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:57,209
We both know you're
seeing Shanice tomorrow.

113
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:03,844
You know, we're all
she's got, Bridge.

114
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:05,479
I understand that, but

115
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,283
you were still picking up
the pieces of her disappearance

116
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,744
when we met, and that was
nine years ago.

117
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:14,314
Don't let this take you back
to where you were, Logan.

118
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:19,231
I'll mull it over.

119
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:23,845
I promise.

120
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:25,649
And promise me you'll shower
before you come back to bed.

121
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:27,457
Okay, hot stuff?

122
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:29,459
All right.

123
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:31,809
Love you. Love you.

124
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:40,644
Oh, come on. Mariah, you're
always stacking the deck.

125
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:42,994
What do you got?

126
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:44,822
Ooh, watch yourself, hot stuff.

127
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:46,931
I can't believe we finally
get to leave for the first time

128
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:49,261
since the pandemic started,
and the Kaminskis are headed

129
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:50,872
to Niagara Falls.
I know.

130
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:52,795
I haven't been on a road trip
since I was a kid.

131
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,703
Oh, and camping's
gonna be great.

132
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:59,446
Oh, come on. The world
is just starting

133
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:01,380
to open up again, but we
still have to stay safe.

134
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:03,232
I know. Which means

135
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:05,635
getting a little creative, but
it's nothing we can't handle.

136
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:07,889
I'll get it.

137
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:08,977
Yeah? Yeah.

138
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,939
What's over there? Absolutely nothing.

139
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:17,812
What do you got?

140
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:20,597
You're really...

141
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:23,513
You're grown!

142
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:25,559
Mariah, who's at the door,
sweetheart?

143
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:27,561
Logan?

144
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:30,520
Oh, thank God.

145
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:32,957
Shanice?

146
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:44,447
I'll admit, I've enjoyed
your delayed

147
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:46,362
departure to Mrs. Grover,

148
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,190
as it's allowed for

149
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,192
our dalliances.

150
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,847
No one says "dalliances"
anymore, Andre.

151
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,371
Well, I do.

152
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,765
Are you sure you have to leave
in a few days?

153
00:06:57,808 --> 00:06:59,331
Yes,

154
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,683
since I refuse to sign
that stupid contract.

155
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,206
I mean, we both do.

156
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:05,749
Right? Have they found
you an apartment?

157
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:07,905
Uh, well...

158
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:10,908
I didn't know how to tell you
this sooner, but...

159
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:12,083
I've signed the contract.

160
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,955
Andre, no.

161
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:15,478
These conservatorships

162
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:17,480
are essentially a prison
sentence if triggered,

163
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:18,936
and I have to believe
they are planning

164
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,179
to trigger them somehow.

165
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:23,094
Why? Why-why would you sign?

166
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:25,488
It was before you found out
how restricting they were.

167
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:28,796
I plan to find
my own lodgings, but,

168
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,581
with all these people coming in,

169
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,322
I want to be here

170
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:34,628
to take care of them.

171
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:37,065
I learned my lesson
with Mildred and Noah.

172
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:38,806
I don't want them
to have to rely

173
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,590
on government medical personnel.

174
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:43,593
Please don't be cross with me.

175
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:45,377
How can I be mad at you

176
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:47,902
when I'm just worried
for you, Andre?

177
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:53,124
Sorry.

178
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:54,952
Uh, you're early.

179
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:57,520
Yeah, I, uh...

180
00:07:57,564 --> 00:08:00,567
just thought the sooner we get
this taken care of, the better.

181
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:04,788
This is Andre.

182
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,181
We've met. We've met.

183
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:08,096
Thank you again
for your assistance

184
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:09,532
in escorting Mildred back

185
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:12,361
after everything.

186
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:14,537
Always there for my daughter.

187
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:15,973
Hayden, now, too.

188
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:18,193
Right, yes, uh,

189
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:21,413
Logan just wants me to sign
some paperwork for Mariah.

190
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,985
She's only missing a week
of school, but, uh...

191
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:33,643
You know, I-I thought
you deserved to be included.

192
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:35,906
Thank you.

193
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:40,432
You might need this.

194
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:50,660
You want me and Logan

195
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:52,662
and Bridget

196
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,708
and Mariah and Hayden

197
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:57,711
to get up there and pretend
we're some big, happy family?

198
00:08:57,754 --> 00:09:00,888
A united, Rockwellian family
is always good for optics.

199
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,977
Look, I know it's weird,

200
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,195
but it's just for one day.

201
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:06,023
And I promise you

202
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:08,199
I know what a difference
perception makes.

203
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:09,505
And we need for people

204
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,160
to see you all as human beings.

205
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:15,685
Yeah. We make it clear that
the 4,400 are everyday people,

206
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:18,209
with family and loved ones, just
like everyone else in Detroit.

207
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:22,213
Yes, everything is just
so incredibly normal.

208
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:24,172
Listen, it's a story.

209
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:27,349
Every image that ever changed
history required a narrative.

210
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:29,394
I've been a part of enough
news cycles to know.

211
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:32,615
And we're hoping you
could convince Logan.

212
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:33,921
I hope you'll consider it.

213
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,098
I got to get back to the office.

214
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:39,100
Thank you.Mm-hmm.

215
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:45,236
Jharrel, I'm worried
about this event.

216
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,761
I can't tell if Rev
is in our corner or not,

217
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:50,198
and I don't trust whatever
the government has planned.

218
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:52,374
Yeah, me neither.

219
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:53,767
All right? But I do trust

220
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,508
that Carla knows
what she's doing.

221
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:59,207
Look, one way to beat them
at their own game

222
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,862
is to get the public
on the 4,400's side.

223
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:04,386
And what about
the conservatorships?

224
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:06,388
Well, it'll be harder
for them to utilize

225
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:08,433
those unlawful tactics.

226
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:09,759
The world rallies
around the people

227
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:11,063
that they're trying to suppress.

228
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:18,879
So, one big, happy family

229
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:21,098
with Logan it is.

230
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,126
I'm sure they would
love to have someone

231
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,456
with your press savvy
to participate, LaDonna.

232
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,502
I, for one, am staying far away.

233
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:38,550
Yes, I have explored
the machine you left,

234
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:41,031
and I am searching
for the remainder

235
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:43,468
of the COBOL code.

236
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:44,469
I...

237
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:46,515
Actually, I'm on a mission

238
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:48,212
regarding that
at this very moment.

239
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:50,562
I'm so sorry, but I will
check in again soon.

240
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:57,352
Hello, my good sir. Uh, hey.

241
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:58,745
You know, how's it going, doc?

242
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:01,312
Well, I miss my partner
in mystery.

243
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:02,966
How is LaDonna doing
at her dad's?

244
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,316
She seems glad to be there,

245
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,188
and for that I am gratified,

246
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:10,844
but I would like to follow up
on something she was working on.

247
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:13,673
Do you happen to have any more
of your brother Manny's books?

248
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,979
You know what, I was actually

249
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,720
about to head
to Claudette's today.

250
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,896
Because I got to clear out
some of his stuff

251
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,724
while she's away
at bartending training.

252
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:24,335
Oh. LaDonna and I found

253
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:26,511
a torn page amongst his things.

254
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:28,775
I'm seeking the rest of it.

255
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:30,472
I could help you
sort through everything.

256
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:32,387
Yeah, of course.So...

257
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,910
Claudette doesn't mind you

258
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:35,738
going to her apartment
while she's away?

259
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:38,262
Mind your business.

260
00:12:06,073 --> 00:12:08,075
She's finally down.

261
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:09,816
Thanks, Mrs. G.

262
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:12,470
You've been working
a lot of long hours lately.

263
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:13,907
Yeah.

264
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,865
You could afford help
around your house.

265
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:18,215
But Mariah loves you.

266
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:20,565
She barely lets me
put her down anymore.

267
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:23,743
Logan, I'm an old lady.
I got simple pleasures.

268
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:27,442
I can't enjoy all of them
when I'm taking care of a baby.

269
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:30,750
And, somehow, I got myself
into taking care of a man

270
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:32,795
without any of the benefits.

271
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,930
Now, I love y'all,

272
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:39,889
but I'm not a crutch
you can lean on forever.

273
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:42,892
We can't go on like this.

274
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:45,765
And this bed
is pretty uncomfortable.

275
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:50,595
It's okay for you
to never forget Shanice,

276
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,947
but you got to move on.

277
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,558
You should talk to somebody.

278
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:59,343
Ah, I don't know.

279
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:01,476
Talking to somebody
about this feels...

280
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,999
It makes it real?

281
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,785
Baby, it is real.

282
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:08,222
Even if she did come back,

283
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:10,398
you can't pick up
where you left off.

284
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:12,008
So...

285
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:15,142
you're getting up out of
this bed, so help me.

286
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:16,839
If not therapy,

287
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,580
I'm signing you up
for FOMO-Mates.

288
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:20,495
Oh, no.

289
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:23,150
Okay. Point taken.

290
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:24,934
Shanice was like
a daughter to me,

291
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:27,284
but she's not here.

292
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:28,871
She's not even in that
big old empty house

293
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:31,506
that you won't go home to.

294
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:33,464
You've got to accept the truth.

295
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:35,989
Bury what you can,

296
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:37,729
and live with the rest.

297
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:51,831
My sister was a lot

298
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,137
of things to a lot of people.

299
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:57,837
To me, she was everything.

300
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,535
It's been five years

301
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,406
since I...

302
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,539
we lost her,

303
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:08,238
but, uh...

304
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:11,328
why can't I move on?

305
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:14,157
Why am I still acting out and...

306
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:17,508
God, making the worst decisions.

307
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:19,510
Me and my girlfriend, uh...

308
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:21,164
Me...

309
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:24,298
and my ex-girlfriend
just recently broke up,

310
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:28,171
and, uh, not even
a second later I'm

311
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:30,347
hooking up with a co-worker.

312
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:37,572
Still trying to make it
all make sense.

313
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:43,099
I'm still pretty new here,

314
00:14:43,143 --> 00:14:45,232
so, uh, thanks

315
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:47,364
for, uh,

316
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:48,626
letting me share.

317
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:53,022
Thank you for sharing.

318
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:54,589
I know it's hard.

319
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:57,200
Yeah, thank you.

320
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,072
I, uh...

321
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:02,336
see a couple new faces, so, uh,

322
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:04,033
guess I got to do
introductions, right?

323
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,036
Hi. I'm Logan.

324
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,690
Hi, Logan.

325
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:14,348
I've been away a while 'cause
I thought I had it handled.

326
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:17,177
Oh, yeah.
Guess not.

327
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,743
So, back in Grief Group.

328
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:20,267
A while back,

329
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,791
the love of my life,
this brilliant,

330
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:24,880
hard-ass lawyer

331
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,447
married me.

332
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,579
You know, we had a family

333
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:30,494
and everything.

334
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:33,280
It was-it was kind of perfect,
to be honest.

335
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:35,412
Then she up and vanished.

336
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:37,675
I wa-I was frantic.

337
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:40,765
I-I was worried something
terrible had happened to her.

338
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:44,291
I just hoped that
I could find her,

339
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:45,466
save her.

340
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:47,598
Well...

341
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:49,383
Then, uh,

342
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:51,211
they found this letter.

343
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:52,777
Police gave me this letter.

344
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:55,911
You know, I-I don't know
what destroyed me more,

345
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,001
The thought of losing her or...

346
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:03,440
the idea that...

347
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:05,679
maybe she was out of my life
because that's what she wanted.

348
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:07,140
Even so,

349
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:09,272
I looked for her for years.

350
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:12,710
Then she came back.

351
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:16,584
Not because she had
a change of heart or anything,

352
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:18,194
she just literally came back.

353
00:16:18,238 --> 00:16:20,544
She fell out of the sky

354
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:22,155
and landed on my doorstep.

355
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:23,852
Wait. She's a 4,400?

356
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:25,985
Look, I-I-I...

357
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:27,682
This is a grief group,

358
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:29,075
not a 4,400 support group.

359
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:31,468
You got what everybody here
prays for,

360
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:33,035
and you want our sympathy?

361
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:35,516
That's what this
is about... 4,400?

362
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,494
Somebody's playing you, man.
The whole thing's a hoax.

363
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:38,562
A hoax? A hoax.

364
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:40,651
No. That is not what this is.

365
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:42,586
It is real, There's no way that people
are falling out of the sky.

366
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,414
And it is a gift from God. No,
I don't think you understand...

367
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:45,743
How do you not have any hope?

368
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,672
Hello?
Logan?

369
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:02,891
You answered.

370
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:04,719
Shanice. You've been calling?

371
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:06,373
Right, right, yes.

372
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,766
I wanted to invite you, um...

373
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,639
to be a part of...

374
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:13,336
this thing with me.

375
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,339
Y-You mean this
Meet the 4,400 thing?

376
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:18,254
Yeah, yeah.
It's-it's a way for the,

377
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:20,430
for the world to kind of...

378
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:21,823
you know, get to know us.

379
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:23,346
It's not just you.

380
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,219
Mariah, Hayden... Bridget.

381
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:29,657
It would be all of us together,
kind of showing how we're

382
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,529
one big, happy family.

383
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,576
Is that what we are?

384
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:39,928
What do you want with me?

385
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:42,191
I'll think about the event.

386
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:46,456
But...

387
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,458
it's a lot right now, okay?

388
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:52,462
Okay.

389
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:53,985
Yeah. Fine.

390
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,076
Is everything okay? That sounded

391
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,426
like an intense call.Yeah. It was

392
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:01,123
just Shanice.

393
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:04,387
She wants me to be a part
of this Meet the 4,400 event.

394
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:06,259
Yeah, Jharrel
mentioned something

395
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:08,522
about you all
appearing together, or... Yeah.

396
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:11,829
It's not that
I don't want to help.

397
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:14,049
I would love to tell the world

398
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,791
how great it's been having
Hayden as a part of my family,

399
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,749
but... Shanice.

400
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:21,056
The man I heard in group...

401
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,102
The one struggling
with Shanice coming back...

402
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,364
He spoke with love.

403
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:26,540
That "against all odds"

404
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,107
kind of love,
and the closest thing

405
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,674
I have to that is my sister.

406
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:32,328
I'm here because I have

407
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:35,070
all of this love for her

408
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,726
that I don't know
what to do with.

409
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:40,815
And I'd give anything
to talk to her one last time.

410
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:45,776
I'm sorry about your sister.

411
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,952
Now, you heard them.

412
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,365
You have been given
the second chance

413
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:50,627
that so many people
in that group...

414
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:52,479
Myself included...
Are jealous of.

415
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:54,481
It's not that simple.

416
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:56,831
Oh, in some ways, it is.

417
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:17,634
Well, I hope something
in here helps.

418
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,821
You, uh, certainly know your
way around Claudette's home.

419
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:34,390
It's almost as if you spend
quite a bit of time here.

420
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:39,128
What did I tell you
about minding your own business?

421
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:41,571
Oh, yes,

422
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:43,965
me and Claudette hooked up
a little while back,

423
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:45,053
and we've just been

424
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:47,490
I don't... enjoying the vibes,

425
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:48,665
seeing where things go.

426
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:52,147
Is that how dating works now?

427
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,889
No declarations, just... vibes?

428
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:58,153
Depends.

429
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,373
Well, I'm asking because.

430
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,897
Shanice and I have been...

431
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,334
enjoying vibes as well,

432
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:07,206
but, yesterday Logan stopped by,

433
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:08,903
and...

434
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:11,558
watching them together...

435
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:14,256
How do I compete
with romantic history

436
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,127
when I don't know
the first thing about

437
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:17,564
21st century courtship?

438
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:19,087
Listen.

439
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,263
Given that I ruined

440
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:23,831
my last relationship
with Carla because

441
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:27,095
I was too obsessed with finding
my missing brother, Manny, I...

442
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:29,228
don't really have
a lot of advice to give,

443
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:30,577
but you...

444
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,840
Okay, I mean,
you do know that Shanice

445
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:34,755
is kind of a situation, right?

446
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:37,061
I mean, you sure
you can handle that?

447
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,281
Well, if I catch your meaning,

448
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:41,370
Claudette qualifies
in that category as well.

449
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:44,373
Are you sure you can handle her?

450
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:46,114
Touché.

451
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:52,163
Wait, is that it?

452
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:56,516
Okay, so what is that? It's
the rest of the COBOL code.

453
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,624
You think it has something to do
with what happened to you all?

454
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:02,173
I'll admit, we are working
on conjecture,

455
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:04,828
but the way your brother
disappeared like us...

456
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:06,265
You thought you saw
a green light.

457
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,354
Yeah, but I don't know.

458
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:10,530
That's why this might be
a fruitless search, but

459
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:13,533
we desperately need answers,
anything that can help us

460
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:15,535
get out from
the government's clutches.

461
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:17,798
Yeah, I hear you on that.

462
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,430
But if Manny is somehow
related to all of this, I...

463
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:24,935
I hope we can find answers that
will bring us all some peace.

464
00:21:35,163 --> 00:21:37,383
Did Logan ever tell you
if he's coming?

465
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:38,384
Nope.

466
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:40,473
Carla's busy figuring out

467
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:42,692
some other family
for the segment.

468
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:47,262
If he's upset about... About us?

469
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,524
Do you think he might be?

470
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:51,266
I-I don't know.

471
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,487
After all this is through,

472
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,185
I request your presence
in the cocktail lounge,

473
00:21:57,228 --> 00:21:58,795
to celebrate your successes.

474
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:01,798
Andre, that's not necessary. Oh, it is.

475
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:03,713
I'm handling my situation.

476
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:06,107
I know how hard you've worked

477
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,630
to make sure this event
helps us all,

478
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:10,372
even those of us who signed
a terrible contract.

479
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,896
It is appreciated.

480
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,426
That man... was at Ypsi Med.

481
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:24,908
I remember he had flames
dancing up his arms.

482
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,130
Does that mean
they're releasing patients?

483
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:31,045
Do you think Noah could be next?

484
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:34,918
You said that man's power
is fire?

485
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:37,834
LaDonna assured me all
our powers are "fire."

486
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,362
But in all seriousness,
what are you thinking?

487
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,628
I don't know,
it could be nothing.

488
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:51,935
I'll find you later. Promise.

489
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:03,120
Just got out of
a security briefing.

490
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:05,340
First thing they do is
shove a tranq in our hands.

491
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,211
Why would they up security
for interviews?

492
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:09,655
And more importantly, who are
those even supposed to protect?

493
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:11,825
Jharrel... Oh, Shanice.

494
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:15,350
I think Bill Greene
is up to something.

495
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,265
He brought in a 4,400
from Ypsi Med

496
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:19,876
whose power is apparently
shooting flames from his arms.

497
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,704
Okay, wait, the 4,400 he added

498
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:23,532
to the interview list
last second?

499
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:25,467
And it sure looked like the
Reverend was in on it with him.

500
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:28,145
I knew I couldn't trust him.

501
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:29,669
He'd be fine
revealing the powers.

502
00:23:29,712 --> 00:23:32,062
He practically did it with
Ji-Eun at his last event.

503
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:33,934
I think he wants it out
in the world.

504
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:35,607
Wait a minute, you think
that's what the government's

505
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:38,112
trying to do here;
Expose y'all's powers?

506
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:39,722
But why would they do that?

507
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,815
Because our powers could be
exactly what they need

508
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:45,380
to trigger the conservatorships.

509
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,077
All of a sudden,
the world thinks

510
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:48,731
we need to be looked after.

511
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:50,951
That we need
to be taken care of.

512
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:52,822
We can't let that happen.

513
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:06,096
Why is that man here
from Ypsi Med?

514
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,968
Are you and the government
trying to

515
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:09,535
reveal our powers to the world?

516
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:12,102
You could be putting us all
in danger.

517
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:16,803
You only see me as a threat,
don't you?

518
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:19,588
Did it ever occur to you
that I'm trying to do right

519
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:20,850
by our people?

520
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:25,309
You aren't the only one
who knows how to

521
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,682
make a difference, Shanice.

522
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,828
Jharrel, he's in here.

523
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:45,962
What is this all about?

524
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:49,618
Hey, man, did they
give you any orders?

525
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:52,055
I show them what I can do.

526
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,713
Brûler...

527
00:24:59,672 --> 00:25:01,282
Then they set me free.

528
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:03,632
Anything is better than

529
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:06,200
going back to where they kept me.
Okay.

530
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:08,202
Shanice was right.
We got to make sure

531
00:25:08,245 --> 00:25:09,571
they don't have any other
tricks up their sleeve...

532
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:12,423
Is it smart, leaving him here?

533
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:16,863
Look, we're trying
to protect you.

534
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:18,168
Get everybody out

535
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:19,276
from underneath
the government's thumb.

536
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,521
Ca... Can you trust us?

537
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:30,485
I want us all to be free.

538
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,661
Us, too.

539
00:25:32,705 --> 00:25:34,228
Us, too.

540
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:36,839
Stay here until we get you.

541
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:44,499
Hello to everyone at home.
This is Gladys Keller.

542
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,546
Today, we're bringing you
an in-depth special

543
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,635
on the mysterious 4,400.

544
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:54,553
Are they just like us, victims
of some terrible circumstance,

545
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,424
or is there more to the story?

546
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:58,426
We're pulling back the curtain,

547
00:25:58,469 --> 00:26:00,820
and hearing from them
in their own words,

548
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:02,648
live and unedited.

549
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:04,258
Our first guest,

550
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:07,391
the prestigious
Reverend Isaiah Johnston,

551
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:10,438
declared deceased in 1993,

552
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:12,179
brings us to the heart of it.

553
00:26:12,222 --> 00:26:14,616
Thank you for that introduction.

554
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,226
As for your question,

555
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,967
I don't think there is
a difference between

556
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:20,056
the 4,400 and everyone else.

557
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,233
See, the Lord works
in mysterious ways.

558
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:25,235
We don't know why
we were brought here,

559
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,934
but we're all human, Gladys.

560
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:32,373
I'm curious, and I'm sure
the folks at home are, too.

561
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:34,157
Why are you all
under the protection

562
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:35,506
of the U.S. government?

563
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:45,081
The government is simply
doing right

564
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:47,083
by a vulnerable population.

565
00:26:47,127 --> 00:26:49,869
Something I think we'd all
want them to do more of.

566
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:51,348
Wouldn't you, Gladys?

567
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,484
Shanice is right this way.

568
00:26:58,312 --> 00:27:01,968
I'm so glad you all
could make it.

569
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:03,883
Hey, Shanice.Hi.

570
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:07,626
I know it'll be
a little strange for us all

571
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:11,630
to share the stage together
and act like...

572
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:14,937
well, um...

573
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:17,853
And it's probably the last thing
you want to do,

574
00:27:17,897 --> 00:27:19,942
especially with
your vacation coming up.

575
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:24,947
Are you excited?

576
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:27,428
Uh, yeah, yeah.

577
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:29,952
Uh, Mom... Yes?

578
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:36,350
Um, I think they want us to

579
00:27:36,393 --> 00:27:39,005
get mics put on or something.

580
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:40,310
Come on.

581
00:27:40,354 --> 00:27:42,312
We'll see you out there. All right.

582
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:44,706
Okay. Come on.

583
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:55,064
Can we talk somewhere,
in private, maybe?

584
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:09,731
Is everything okay?

585
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:12,560
Are you upset about
seeing me with Andre?

586
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:16,216
I don't know what
the rules are here. I know.

587
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:18,000
You're married
to someone else now,

588
00:28:18,044 --> 00:28:21,264
and I just thought you didn't
want anything to do with me.

589
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:24,485
Am I being unfaithful?

590
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:26,443
No. You're not.

591
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:31,448
I am.

592
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:39,369
Look, right or wrong, I was
upset seeing you with Andre.

593
00:28:40,588 --> 00:28:42,198
It's hard not to have
these feelings

594
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:44,322
when you're the first woman
I ever fell in love with.

595
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:49,684
And when you left,
it-it broke me.

596
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,947
I still don't know how
I picked up the pieces.

597
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,341
That's not true.

598
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:57,126
'Cause a part of me never did.

599
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:04,307
I've been waiting and hoping
for all that it's worth

600
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:05,744
that you'd come back one day.

601
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:12,141
Are you saying you want
to give us a second chance?

602
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:17,973
I'm sorry.

603
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:25,633
It's taken me till now
to realize we...

604
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:27,287
we can't go back.

605
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:31,465
There's no erasing
the last 16 years.

606
00:29:31,508 --> 00:29:34,076
When you came back,
we got our second chance,

607
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,557
but it was a second
chance at closure.

608
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,037
I don't understand.

609
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,996
No, no, I know that
I was supposed to come onstage

610
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,217
and-and talk about
our happy, blended,

611
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,653
non-traditional family,

612
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:47,524
but I can't do that with you
anymore, Shanice.

613
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:51,267
I've got to make
a clean break and move on.

614
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:54,531
I've got to commit
to my family, to Hayden.

615
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:56,011
This...

616
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:01,800
It's not fair to us
or the people who love us.

617
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:04,803
We are good people, Shanice.

618
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:10,373
It's time we deal with reality.

619
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:22,037
One reality being that
you're still gonna be

620
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:24,823
a kick-ass mom to Mariah.

621
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:28,739
I want that for both of you...

622
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:35,355
even if I can't be
a part of it.

623
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:54,417
This is goodbye, Shanice.

624
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,338
Just-just wait.

625
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:05,341
You can't close
the investigation.

626
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:07,343
No, you're asking me
to give up hope on my wife,

627
00:31:07,387 --> 00:31:09,998
and I won't. She wouldn't
give up on me. I'm sorry,

628
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:12,348
but she made it pretty clear
she doesn't want to be found.

629
00:31:12,392 --> 00:31:14,350
What?
What are you talking about?

630
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:48,471
You've gotta let me go, Shanice.

631
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:52,911
I know.

632
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:57,828
You should go
be with your family.

633
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:00,135
Thank you.

634
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,696
And we are back, live
from the Bois Blanc Hotel.

635
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,439
I'm happy to introduce you
to the first truly blended

636
00:32:43,483 --> 00:32:46,442
4,400 and 2021 family.

637
00:32:46,486 --> 00:32:50,098
We have husband and wife Logan
Kaminski and Bridget Templeton,

638
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:53,275
their beautiful daughter
Mariah, and Hayden Turner,

639
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:57,018
the 4,400 they've welcomed into
their home. Hello, everyone.

640
00:32:57,062 --> 00:32:58,411
Thanks, Gladys.

641
00:32:58,454 --> 00:33:00,456
We're just so happy
to have been able

642
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,980
to invite Hayden into our home.

643
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:03,633
It's really been wonderful.

644
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:04,721
Hey, Rev.

645
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,507
Sister Shanice.

646
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,441
Aren't you supposed to be
up there with your family?

647
00:33:09,465 --> 00:33:12,555
Don't tell me you got
dressed up for nothing.

648
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:16,733
Nope. It all worked out
how it was supposed to.

649
00:33:16,777 --> 00:33:19,301
Thank you for doing
the right thing.

650
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:22,696
I think the government wanted
to make a spectacle out of us

651
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:25,786
on live television so they could
control us further.

652
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:28,832
The right thing would be
letting Bill Greene know

653
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:31,574
what I think about those
contracts he made people sign.

654
00:33:32,662 --> 00:33:34,708
I looked into it after
we spoke the other day.

655
00:33:34,751 --> 00:33:37,319
I should have realized
what he was up to.

656
00:33:37,363 --> 00:33:39,278
Hubris on my part.

657
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:42,150
But make no mistake.

658
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:44,152
I won't let anyone
harm these people.

659
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,903
Is it true that, along with
sponsoring Hayden, your wife...

660
00:33:55,946 --> 00:34:00,212
Well, ex-wife... Shanice
is also one of the 4,400?

661
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:04,042
For years, we...
we wondered what happened.

662
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:06,914
I don't think we ever could have
imagined the truth, though.

663
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:09,395
It freed me in some ways.

664
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:10,874
Now, obviously, there...

665
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:11,982
There are bigger mysteries
to be solved,

666
00:34:12,006 --> 00:34:15,227
but I'm blessed to have gotten

667
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,707
a closure that few get.

668
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:19,448
You know, a new lease on life

669
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:22,321
that I'm just very grateful
to have.

670
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,543
Our fire starter is
somehow AWOL.

671
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:28,999
We have people trying
to look for him,

672
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:30,546
but what are we supposed to do?

673
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,113
We have names.

674
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,467
Mildred.

675
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:41,035
So glad you're safe.

676
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,212
I'm not safe.
None of us are safe.

677
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:50,392
Having Hayden come into
our home was unexpected,

678
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:52,873
but he's brought so much good
into our lives, I can't imagine

679
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:54,440
him being anywhere else.Yeah.

680
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:56,616
And how about you, Hayden?
Are you happy?

681
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:59,097
More than I thought I could be.

682
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,924
I understand you're upset.

683
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:03,623
But believe it or not, we have
been very worried about you.

684
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:05,799
So has your sister Millicent.

685
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:09,019
Here's what I want.

686
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:13,546
You free them,

687
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:15,461
and I'll let you go.

688
00:35:15,504 --> 00:35:17,898
All it takes is one call.

689
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:21,162
Well, after this broadcast,
you may be the first

690
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:22,903
4,400 heartthrob, Hayden.

691
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:26,863
He's taken.

692
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:30,606
No, not by me. Another 4,400.

693
00:35:32,478 --> 00:35:35,394
She's like, so awesome.

694
00:35:35,437 --> 00:35:37,178
Stop lying.

695
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:39,224
The government doesn't
care about us.

696
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:41,095
We're just experiments to you.

697
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,837
But you guys forget that
we're the ones who have power.

698
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:00,854
I can take you to your sister.

699
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:04,292
She's been quite upset
since you left.

700
00:36:04,336 --> 00:36:05,336
Mildred.

701
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:10,080
Oh, my God.

702
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:13,214
Mildred?

703
00:36:15,521 --> 00:36:17,000
Let's go.

704
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:18,001
Go. Go, go, go.

705
00:36:18,045 --> 00:36:19,351
Up. Up in the window.

706
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:23,833
Mildred, you have to stop this.

707
00:36:23,877 --> 00:36:25,661
This isn't the plan
God chose for us.

708
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:28,316
You kept me a prisoner
for no reason.

709
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,667
Well, I'll give you a reason.

710
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:42,678
No.

711
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:47,205
Stop.

712
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:49,990
Fine! You're next.

713
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,608
What did you do to my powers?

714
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:03,046
What did you do to me?

715
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,918
I... I don't know.

716
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:06,615
But you can't let them
catch you.

717
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,619
Run. Run!

718
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:27,569
There's an exit this way.
Please move safely.

719
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:28,811
No. No. Excuse me. Excuse me.

720
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:31,292
Keisha. Keisha.
I need your help.

721
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:33,990
Bridget and Mariah are safe, but
I can't find Hayden anywhere.

722
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:36,732
I-I might know where he is.

723
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:38,647
Wait. Did you know
about their powers?

724
00:37:42,782 --> 00:37:44,262
I knew about the powers.

725
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:46,829
Okay? But what just
happened with Mildred,

726
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:48,242
that I had no idea
was gonna happen.

727
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,790
Does-does Hayden? Can he...

728
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:53,943
You gotta let him tell
you in his own way.

729
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:56,970
The whole world saw that,
Keisha. It was live.

730
00:37:57,013 --> 00:37:59,277
I mean, what's gonna
happen to them?

731
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,757
I don't know.

732
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:03,411
I don't know. Come on.

733
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:06,153
Excuse me.

734
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:10,113
Well, I'll give you a reason.

735
00:38:14,727 --> 00:38:16,729
Look, you can just
pack up my stuff

736
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:18,383
and just drop it off
at the hotel, okay?

737
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:21,995
I know you don't want me
in your home anymore.

738
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:23,581
Now that you know
I've been lying to you.

739
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:25,172
I'm not mad at you.

740
00:38:25,215 --> 00:38:27,783
I'm upset with the adults
who kept things from me,

741
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:30,003
but, Hayden...

742
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,660
you're just a kid

743
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:37,315
dealing with an
impossible situation.

744
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:40,318
It's my job to protect you.

745
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,015
I am not going anywhere.

746
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:52,025
I saw how much you
cared about Mildred

747
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:53,809
when you broke her
out of Ypsi Med.

748
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:55,507
Must have been hard
seeing her like that.

749
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:59,162
This is all my fault.

750
00:38:59,206 --> 00:39:00,773
Isn't it?

751
00:39:02,644 --> 00:39:04,733
I messed up.

752
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:09,129
I should have helped her.

753
00:39:09,172 --> 00:39:10,609
I should have known...

754
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:12,524
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

755
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:13,916
Come here.

756
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,401
Sometimes loving someone

757
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:24,144
isn't enough to save them...

758
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:26,059
or your relationship with them.

759
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:31,369
But that does not mean...

760
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:33,196
that you aren't enough.

761
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,808
That you didn't give it
everything you've got.

762
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:38,201
It just means...

763
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:42,684
you had different roads
to go down.

764
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:44,860
Okay?

765
00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:56,306
You ready to come home now?

766
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,702
Aren't you afraid
of what my power is?

767
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:03,096
I know you'd never hurt us.

768
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:05,141
I don't need to know
your power to know that.

769
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,884
You can tell me
when you're ready.

770
00:40:08,928 --> 00:40:10,625
I just want you safe.

771
00:40:22,768 --> 00:40:25,466
Welcome to Harlem, 1924.

772
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,381
Seeing it in my memories
is no replacement

773
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,296
for seeing it in the... flesh.

774
00:40:30,558 --> 00:40:32,517
What is wrong?

775
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:38,610
The event went terribly, Andre.

776
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:41,613
Mildred was there.

777
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:45,747
She threw Bill Greene
out the window.

778
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,708
The powers are out
for the world to see.

779
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:51,840
Oh, no...

780
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:57,063
I think the conservatorships
are gonna be triggered.

781
00:40:59,718 --> 00:41:01,546
Your conservatorship.

782
00:41:02,938 --> 00:41:05,332
I'm terrified of what is
gonna happen to you.

783
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:06,986
As am I.

784
00:41:07,029 --> 00:41:09,684
I am terrified for all of us.

785
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:12,905
And that is a problem
we will have to face tomorrow.

786
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:18,301
But for now, we dance like
tomorrow will never come.

787
00:41:19,694 --> 00:41:21,827
We have to figure out
how to protect you.

788
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:28,703
Tomorrow.

789
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:34,100
Tomorrow.
