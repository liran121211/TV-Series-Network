1
00:00:02,306 --> 00:00:05,614
It's been 48 hours since
Special Agent William Greene,

2
00:00:05,657 --> 00:00:07,572
a high-level
government official,

3
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:09,618
was seen being thrown out
of Detroit's

4
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:11,620
Bois Blanc Hotel window

5
00:00:11,663 --> 00:00:13,274
by this mere girl.

6
00:00:13,317 --> 00:00:15,667
She has been identified
as Mildred Bell,

7
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:18,061
last seen in
Sebastopol, California

8
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:19,671
in 1972.

9
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:21,499
But what's really gripped us all

10
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:23,110
was the fact that Miss Bell

11
00:00:23,153 --> 00:00:26,026
committed this horrendous
act of violence

12
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:27,418
telekinetically.

13
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:29,203
Ever since they
landed on Belle Isle

14
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:30,856
seven weeks ago,

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,468
the 4,400 have been
in the public's eye

16
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:34,773
and imagination.

17
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:35,861
And we were there,

18
00:00:35,905 --> 00:00:36,906
broadcasting to you live,

19
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:38,342
as our cameras

20
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:39,561
captured the secret

21
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:41,215
they've been hiding all along.

22
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:43,478
What you've seen on your screens

23
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:46,481
over the last 48 hours
demands answers

24
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:47,917
and has led many of us

25
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,527
to ask the question:

26
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:52,617
Are any of us truly safe?

27
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:55,446
Do you remember where you were,
what you were doing,

28
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,492
when you first saw
the revelation

29
00:00:57,535 --> 00:00:59,407
of their destructive powers?

30
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:05,630
And we are back.

31
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:07,589
Live from the Bois Blanc Hotel.

32
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:10,505
I'm gonna circle back
on our friend Bruno.

33
00:01:10,548 --> 00:01:12,159
Make sure he hasn't
gone full pyro.

34
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:13,899
All right, bet.
But from what he said.

35
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:15,138
He didn't want to go along
with the government's plan

36
00:01:15,162 --> 00:01:16,511
to make the 4,400look bad

37
00:01:16,554 --> 00:01:18,121
any more than we
wanted it to happen.

38
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:20,186
Okay, and I believe that,
but I don't know what kind of

39
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,560
accidental damages might occur
when someone can shoot fire

40
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:25,302
from their hands, so...

41
00:01:31,352 --> 00:01:33,093
What the hell?

42
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:41,381
- All hands on deck.
- All hands on deck.

43
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:43,581
Let's go, let's go. Move, move.

44
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,105
Hey!

45
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:46,628
What happened?

46
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:48,847
There was an incident
in the courtyard.

47
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:57,117
And we are back.

48
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,770
Live from the Bois Blanc Hotel.

49
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:00,990
I am happy to introduce you

50
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:03,514
to the first truly blended 4,400

51
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:05,429
and 2021 family.

52
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:08,302
We have husband and wife,
Logan Kaminski

53
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:09,825
and Bridget Templeton,

54
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:11,392
their beautiful daughter Mariah,

55
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:14,264
and Hayden Turner, the 4,400

56
00:02:14,308 --> 00:02:15,918
they have welcomed
into their home.

57
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:17,137
Hi, everybody.

58
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,660
Hi. Hi.

59
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:20,314
Thanks, Gladys. We're just so

60
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:21,924
happy to have been able
to invite Hayden

61
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:23,186
into our home. Hey, Jess.

62
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,883
What you watching?

63
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:26,233
Dana.

64
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:27,756
Hi. Um...

65
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:29,497
Look, about the
other night, I...

66
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,195
I... didn't mean to... I mean,

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,217
I-I just got out of kind of
a pretty serious relationship,

68
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:35,372
so I-I shouldn't have...

69
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,417
No sweat, Tanner.

70
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,722
I needed to blow off

71
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,376
some steam, too. Hot chocolate,

72
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,291
shot of espresso. Thank you.

73
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:47,950
Uh, you know, having Hayden
in our home...

74
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:49,952
Agent Tanner. Hi, Bill.

75
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:52,563
Patient 32 is confirmed
and standing by at location.

76
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:54,261
Everything looks like
it's going well...

77
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:55,392
Well, it's not.

78
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:57,002
Our fire starter
is somehow AWOL.

79
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:58,284
We have people trying
to look for him, but...

80
00:02:58,308 --> 00:02:59,962
Wait, what do you mean
he's AWOL?

81
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:00,963
What're we supposed to do?
How could you lose him?

82
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:02,356
We have names.

83
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:03,357
Bill?

84
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,402
Who is that? Is...

85
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:07,230
What's going on?
Is that Patient 48?

86
00:03:10,538 --> 00:03:12,192
Oh, that's not-not me.

87
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:13,236
Another 4,400.

88
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:17,197
She's, like, so awesome.

89
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,072
Oh, my God.

90
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:30,122
And we are back. Live from the

91
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,863
Bois Blanc Hotel. I'm happy

92
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:33,387
to introduce you...

93
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,997
How can they give
these freaks airtime?

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,738
4,400...

95
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,964
Yo, Steve.

96
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:48,837
Hilarious, right? Come on.

97
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,318
Dude, they're...
they're not that bad.

98
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:55,322
How about this one?

99
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:58,803
Whoa. The hell was that?

100
00:03:58,847 --> 00:03:59,867
All hands
on deck. All hands on deck.

101
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:01,458
Courtyard compromised.

102
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:02,783
Cover this corridor
and wait for further orders.

103
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:04,350
Come on. Let's go, let's go.
Move, move.

104
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:05,984
Officer needs assistance.

105
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:07,919
Bill Greene was thrown
from a third-story window.

106
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:08,987
She tried to kill him.

107
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:11,033
Stop.

108
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:15,124
Brother, calm now.

109
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:17,648
We need to pray for Bill.

110
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,824
Courtyard, courtyard.

111
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,266
And we are back.

112
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:27,745
And Neela's got the twins, too.

113
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,573
She's an ER doctor now.

114
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:31,358
Beti.

115
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:32,968
I'm tired of being the only

116
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:34,796
boomer at Jummah
with a single daughter.

117
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,188
They're asking questions.

118
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:38,365
"Oh, Aamira, when is Soraya

119
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,802
bringing home
one of those Goris?"

120
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,285
You know what? It doesn't
matter, Mom. All good.

121
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,547
It does matter.

122
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,896
You work too much as it is.Okay.

123
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:48,940
You owe them nothing.

124
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:50,333
Not those 4,400s

125
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:51,856
or those other people
you work for.

126
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,032
You've been in service
how many years?

127
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:55,860
And they detain you

128
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:58,559
like some terrorist,
when we know

129
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:00,430
for a fact the real terrorists
in this country

130
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:01,823
are the ones who look like them.

131
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,128
Ma. Oh, my God.

132
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:05,957
Seriously? You're gonna
get me in trouble.

133
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:08,327
And I'm proud of your work. I
see this whole event on the TV,

134
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,832
this nice family, it all looks
very big and important,

135
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,703
but I want you to stay safe.

136
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:14,314
I only care about you.

137
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:15,576
Okay, Ma.

138
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:17,708
Oh, Soraya!

139
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:23,323
Up. Up in the window.

140
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:27,239
What the actual hell?
You kept me a prisoner...

141
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:28,893
It's clear that the 4,400

142
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:30,939
have been hiding their
true nature from the world.

143
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:32,462
What could they want from us?

144
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:35,509
And what kind of threat
do they pose?

145
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:37,424
Right now,
officials cannot explain

146
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:39,556
what is happening
in these frightening images,

147
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,906
and so we must remember
how things were.

148
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,256
Because after this
monumental revelation,

149
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,737
nothing will ever
be the same again.

150
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:48,173
You kept me a prisoner

151
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:49,392
for no reason...

152
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:07,976
Federal and local governments

153
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:10,413
have set up a tip line
for the public to call,

154
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:12,415
asking for your help to report

155
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,112
any suspicious activity.

156
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:16,680
We're joined now live
from D.C. by Justin François

157
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:18,116
with the latest
on these events...

158
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,816
Which is why we will now
be triggering

159
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,861
the conservatorships
we already have in place.

160
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:25,186
What about our safety?
How is that gonna help?

161
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,603
How can you even enforce that?

162
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:28,997
Obviously, a number
of the 4,400 are already

163
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,391
integrated to the general
public, out on their own,

164
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:32,846
but the government
knows where they are,

165
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,046
and the tip line allows
for any citizen to call in

166
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,440
if they have any suspicious
activity relating to them.

167
00:06:37,484 --> 00:06:38,963
Why not just round them up?

168
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,574
Because, legally speaking,

169
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:42,663
we do not have justification
to detain them, yet.

170
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:44,708
However, those 4,400

171
00:06:44,752 --> 00:06:46,275
who have signed our contracts

172
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:47,470
will now be placed
under our conservatorship,

173
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:49,626
for everyone's safety.

174
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,586
Until we know more, they will be
held at the hotel with no

175
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:55,066
outside contact.
That means no more phones,

176
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,720
or access to the Internet.

177
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:58,679
They'll be subjected
to a new regimen

178
00:06:58,722 --> 00:07:00,724
of medical care and testing,

179
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:02,485
and all information obtained
will be the property

180
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:03,901
of the federal government.

181
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:05,816
They will be sequestered
in the Bois Blanc,

182
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,078
until further notice,

183
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:08,906
subject to questioning,

184
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,058
and their movement within
this facility will be monitored.

185
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:12,475
Guards are authorized
to use force

186
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,216
if necessary.

187
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,784
Are you okay?

188
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:21,266
I'm so sorry.
The conservatorships

189
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,181
give them the legal right. I...

190
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:26,141
I don't know what we can do.

191
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:28,491
So, we're back
to being prisoners.

192
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:30,406
Some of us more than others.

193
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:45,203
Okay, this is beyond messed up.

194
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:46,485
A tip line only
encourages people

195
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,163
to further demonize the 4,400,

196
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:49,880
and you saw firsthand
at the bar with Claudette

197
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:51,514
how bad it was
before the world knew.

198
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:55,083
True, but we all saw
Mildred's little demonstration.

199
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:56,277
Honestly, I'm surprised
the government

200
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:57,540
isn't responding more severely.

201
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:58,869
Yeah, because that's

202
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:00,480
exactly what they planned
for it to be.

203
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:02,501
Look, Mildred only did
what Bruno was supposed to do,

204
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,266
reveal their powers
to the world,

205
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:06,418
and your girlfriend already knew
about those powers, remember?

206
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,618
Ex. Ex-girlfriend.

207
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:10,533
Yeah, whatever. Mildred is dangerous.

208
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:13,101
It doesn't take a bunch
of 4,400 with powers

209
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:14,711
to do some real damage.

210
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:16,297
It just takes one.
The government has to protect

211
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:17,932
the public. Oh, come on.

212
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:19,716
Anybody can be dangerous,

213
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,502
but giving paranoid people
a reason to profile the 4,400,

214
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:25,200
using this conservatorship BS

215
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:26,569
to take their rights away,
this is how

216
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,005
a police state works,
and you know it.

217
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:29,683
You're oversimplifying
the situation.

218
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:31,119
I'm not.

219
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:33,774
Things are getting bad,
which is why I wanted

220
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:35,515
to show you this.

221
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:39,257
Yeah, I remember.

222
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:40,670
You and your brother
doodle a clock.

223
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:42,565
You take turns
putting in numbers.

224
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:45,307
Yes. Look, Manny is here,

225
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,265
doing this somehow,
playing the game again.

226
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:48,745
I put this two up weeks ago.

227
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:51,531
And that six just
showed up, but...

228
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:53,010
It should be a three.

229
00:08:53,054 --> 00:08:54,534
So, it's wrong?

230
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:56,536
Jharrel, what does
this have to do with...

231
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:59,147
Yes, it's wrong, but I think

232
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,323
that's because Manny's trying
to tell me something.

233
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,545
Jharrel, anyone
could've done this.

234
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:08,852
A bored employee.
A 4,400 with a power or a pen.

235
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:10,941
Or my brother,

236
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:13,640
who might be involved
with all of this somehow.

237
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:15,598
The timing alone... I mean,

238
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:18,558
this showed up right before
everything went down.

239
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,821
Look, you didn't know him,
all right,

240
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:23,258
but Manny was...
he was brilliant.

241
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:27,131
He saw the world differently.

242
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:29,612
I think that Manny's
trying to reach me.

243
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:37,577
Ji-Eun,

244
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,622
it's gonna be all right.

245
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,798
You're not the one
who's wearing these clothes.

246
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:44,453
You didn't sign the contract.

247
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:46,586
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

248
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:48,413
I can't be held prisoner again.

249
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:51,025
After everything we've already lost...
Are you okay?

250
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,510
I just want to go back.

251
00:09:58,554 --> 00:10:00,687
To my family, to my friends,

252
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,166
to Harold.

253
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,622
I thought it could be
okay, but this...

254
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,474
I miss my family, too.

255
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:06,910
My old life.

256
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:12,612
I just got
a Jack Russell Terrier. Haneul.

257
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:20,881
He was super sweet.

258
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,448
I bet he was a handful...

259
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,320
but I bet you took
great care of him.

260
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:29,367
This is all so overwhelming,

261
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:32,719
but it doesn't have to
overrun us.

262
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:35,678
Think of Haneul next time.

263
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:38,899
Okay? Okay.

264
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:41,292
Thank you, Shanice.

265
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:46,428
I hate them for
doing this to us.

266
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:51,433
You holding up all right?

267
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:54,654
Thank you for helping her.

268
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:55,916
I just...

269
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,745
I've never not known
what to say.

270
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:00,660
I should be able
to lead these people.

271
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:03,488
It's my fault
that this has happened.

272
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:08,015
Why didn't you sign
one of those contracts?

273
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:13,107
To be honest, I was more focused
on the task at hand.

274
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,544
I was working
in tandem with Bill,

275
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:17,677
keeping people safe, protected.

276
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,027
I never thought that...

277
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,551
If only I'd
got to him before Mildred.

278
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:24,988
Still, you saved his life
by stopping her.

279
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:28,426
The only thing that matters
is moving forward.

280
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,213
We have to figure out
how to fix this.

281
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:40,917
Come in.
Since when do they knock?

282
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:46,706
Uh, hi.

283
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:49,143
Word on the street
was you wanted to see me?

284
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:50,753
You must be Soraya?

285
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:52,233
The very one.

286
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:56,367
What's up?

287
00:11:58,021 --> 00:12:00,415
LaDonna said you helped her
build this computer,

288
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,982
and that if I ever
needed anything,

289
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:03,635
I could reach out to you,

290
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,526
and I haven't heard from her
for a few days now,

291
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,117
and... Uh, same, actually.

292
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:10,033
Hm. Seems we've both
been ghosts.

293
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:13,994
Oh. Uh, "ghosted."

294
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:15,386
"Ghosted."

295
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,780
Hmm. But this can't wait.

296
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:21,784
I must know if anything we found
at Ypsi Med helps us understand

297
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:23,481
what the government
wants from us.

298
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,670
I live in fear of the guards
finding this.

299
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:46,896
I'm at an impasse.

300
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,550
I can see the files,

301
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:49,856
but there are so many of them,

302
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,224
and I don't know
what I'm looking for.

303
00:12:51,248 --> 00:12:54,338
And I managed to finally type in

304
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:58,821
all of Manny's COBOL code,
but what to do next...

305
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,262
Uh, I am so sorry.

306
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:07,264
Uh, but...

307
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:11,094
you, LaDonna, Mildred,

308
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:13,140
you can all...

309
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:16,404
You know what,
it's not important.

310
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:19,015
You want to know
if we all have powers,

311
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:20,930
and what they are.

312
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:23,803
It doesn't matter.

313
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,848
I know firsthand
what that feels like,

314
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:27,894
being asked endless questions.

315
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:30,026
I'm sorry.

316
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,854
I was being rude.

317
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:35,031
Just know that I am
no danger to you.

318
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:37,468
You can trust me. Trust us.

319
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,039
You understand what that says?

320
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,607
Uh, some parts, yeah.

321
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,759
Basically, it was written
to analyze and compartmentalize

322
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:49,480
large data sets.

323
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:51,874
Like the patient files
we got from Ypsi Med?

324
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:53,049
Exactly.

325
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:56,966
But we've got to run it
through a compiler,

326
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,883
which I think our girl LaDonna

327
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,493
forgot to install.

328
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:03,755
And you could do that?

329
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,235
Yeah. I can download a compiler

330
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,281
and do a quick install.

331
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,920
I'll come find you when we're
ready to run this sucker.

332
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,288
Run?

333
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:17,030
Where will we be running?

334
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:20,947
Yo, you wanted to see me?

335
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,950
Uh, yes. Thank you for coming.

336
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:26,126
I just wanted to
let you know that

337
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:29,085
you are fired.

338
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:31,609
Effective immediately.
Thank you for your service.

339
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,918
Wow. So it's like that?

340
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:39,095
You know, I figured things
might be changing around here

341
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,968
for all of us,
but nope, just me, huh?

342
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:44,666
You have been a pain in my ass

343
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:46,711
from the minute
you entered this facility.

344
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:48,278
You've broken numerous rules.

345
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,541
You assisted in the attempted
escape of 32...

346
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:52,065
You mean Bruno Comtois?

347
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:54,197
They have names, Jessica.

348
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:56,896
So will you be needing
a police escort or...

349
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,506
You really want to
play this game?

350
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:01,683
See, because I know what
y'all are up to at Ypsi Med.

351
00:15:01,726 --> 00:15:03,380
So you can fire me all you want,

352
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:05,992
but what is to keep me
from telling the truth?

353
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:07,341
Huh? From going to the press?

354
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:08,951
Call Gladys Keller
for all I care.

355
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:11,954
You would actually be
doing me a favor.

356
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,564
After Mildred's little display,

357
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:15,349
the public is just waiting
for confirmation

358
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:17,133
that all the 4,400 have powers.

359
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:19,135
And when they get that,
they'll be begging for us

360
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:20,528
to protect them.

361
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:24,271
We shine when we serve
and protect. Remember?

362
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:28,338
You're gonna regret being
on this side

363
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:29,885
of history, Jessica.

364
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:49,339
I have an idea.Please.

365
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:51,559
Well, it's really an idea
we already had.

366
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:53,953
Your sermon a few weeks ago?

367
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:55,780
Our call for sanctuary.

368
00:15:55,824 --> 00:15:57,391
We need to finish
what we started.

369
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:59,697
We need to make this hotel
a religious sanctuary

370
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:03,266
for all of the 4,400,
and for real this time.

371
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,790
No more government deals.

372
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:08,010
Believe me, lesson learned.

373
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:09,751
When sanctuary is granted,

374
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:12,101
it would nullify
these conservatorships.

375
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:13,383
The government wouldn't
even be able to

376
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:15,017
step foot in here.

377
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:16,516
And I already finished
a lot of the paperwork

378
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,022
before you struck your deal
with Bill Greene.

379
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:24,070
But creating a church here,
it was predicated

380
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:27,029
on my being their leader, right?

381
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,596
And I just don't know.

382
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,859
Ever since... Mildred.

383
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:33,557
Right?

384
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:37,083
You were up there with her.

385
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:41,783
You've seemed... off ever since.

386
00:16:44,612 --> 00:16:46,701
Did something happen
when you were with her?

387
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:53,012
I pulled her away
from the window

388
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,796
to try to stop her, and...

389
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,452
when I let go,
her powers were gone.

390
00:16:58,495 --> 00:17:01,542
What do you mean, "gone"?

391
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:03,239
She tried to use
her powers on me,

392
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:05,024
but she couldn't.

393
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,373
She couldn't.

394
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,679
And as I've thought about it,

395
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:12,901
I've come to realize that
perhaps this is my power.

396
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:14,772
To negate the powers
of others and...

397
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:16,818
You can take away powers?

398
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:18,820
It can't be!

399
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:21,649
I champion that
which makes us special.

400
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,781
Our powers, our abilities.

401
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:25,653
What does it mean
if I can take it all away?

402
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:29,265
What kind of leader
can I be for them?

403
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:33,226
I can't.

404
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,328
Here is to lasting
as long as I did.

405
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:50,069
Mm. 'Cause Lord knows

406
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,114
she wanted me gone
since day one.

407
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:56,162
Yeah, I did have to save
your ass a few times.

408
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:59,339
Yeah, well,
now she dumped us both.

409
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:01,080
No, something changed.

410
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,101
Okay? She's not the same as
she was when this all started.

411
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,172
Or she is, and you are
just seeing things

412
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:07,303
more clearly now.

413
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,000
Hmm. You mean your way.

414
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:11,090
Well, my way does collect
unemployment now, so...

415
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,353
Hey, at least
I'm still there, huh?

416
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:17,096
Run interference between
Jessica and the 4,400.

417
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,272
You think you can keep
your girl in check? Mm.

418
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:20,882
How many times
do I have to tell you

419
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:22,362
she is not my girl, Jharrel?

420
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:24,146
You sure about that?

421
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,714
'Cause I caught her looking
at you this morning during

422
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:29,195
what turned out to be
my farewell briefing.

423
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:37,116
Anyway, now that I am banned
from the Bois Blanc,

424
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,553
do you think you can, like,
I don't know,

425
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:42,033
at least keep an eye
on the clock for me?

426
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:45,689
You know, take photos, uh,
text me if anything new appears.

427
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:47,517
Jharrel, if he was trying
to talk to you,

428
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:51,565
why not just go, like,
"Bloop, here I am, bro.

429
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:53,393
And-and here's
your urgent message."

430
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:54,785
I don't know.

431
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:57,571
Okay? Maybe he's in
danger or something,

432
00:18:57,614 --> 00:18:58,765
and that's why
he hasn't appeared.

433
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,574
But that mark showed up

434
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:02,184
right when everything
went to hell.

435
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:05,361
Look, I can't believe that
that means nothing.

436
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:07,581
You have a better explanation
for any of the stuff

437
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:08,904
that's been going on these days?

438
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:14,370
All right, fine.

439
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:16,807
I'll keep an eye
on your damn wall.

440
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:19,158
Thanks, partner.

441
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:26,121
And this next round is
going on my Chime card.

442
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:30,430
Hey. What can I get you?

443
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:38,568
It feels like a distant
memory, the fresh air.

444
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:40,788
Glad to see no one has
discovered our tunnel

445
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:42,355
into the free world.

446
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:44,661
Yeah, you're right, but
I hope no one sees us.

447
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:47,795
That tip line has me spooked.

448
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:51,451
Since Mildred's display,
it's as if the whole world

449
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:54,976
is just waiting for one of us
to spontaneously combust.

450
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:57,413
Hmm. Well, our powers,

451
00:19:57,457 --> 00:19:59,633
it is all a lot to take in.

452
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:02,113
And especially difficult
given our lack of privacy.

453
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,815
I was with Rev earlier
when he confided in me

454
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:09,314
that he thinks when
he grabbed Mildred

455
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:10,296
up in that office,

456
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:12,211
he took away her powers.

457
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:15,866
What does this mean?

458
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,087
That with the slightest touch
he can absorb

459
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,307
or relieve us of our powers? I don't know.

460
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:24,919
But it is something
he's processing right now.

461
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:28,401
And I know you, Andre.
Give him some time

462
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:32,013
before you go all
scientific method on him.

463
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:34,929
Well, to be honest, I have
other pressing concerns.

464
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:37,801
And, I'm happy to report,
we have a new ally.

465
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:38,846
What? Mm-hmm.

466
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:40,282
Who?

467
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:43,677
There's a woman,
a tech-spert named Soraya,

468
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,679
who's helping us
look into these files.

469
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:49,073
If we can make sense
of all of this...

470
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:52,120
then maybe we can find
a way forward.

471
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:03,523
Hey.

472
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:04,567
We gotta go.

473
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:06,613
What are you doing?

474
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:07,788
Oh, no.

475
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:08,963
No, Andre. People may see.

476
00:21:09,006 --> 00:21:10,573
He needs help, Shanice.

477
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:13,576
God! Holy mothballs, this hurts!
You okay?

478
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,275
Steve, let me just...

479
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:26,459
What the... Andre, let's go now.

480
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,469
This is exactly what
I was afraid of.

481
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:39,123
That person near us was
for sure calling that tip line.

482
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:41,735
What if they come for us, Andre?

483
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:43,737
Take you to Ypsi Med?

484
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,380
I couldn't leave Steve
in pain like that.

485
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:47,804
When you take an oath
to help people,

486
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:49,308
you can't choose your patients.

487
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,614
We aren't on the front lines
of a war, Andre.

488
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:53,224
Nor are you practicing
in a hospital.

489
00:21:53,268 --> 00:21:55,705
You do have a choice
in who you heal right now,

490
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:58,317
because it impacts more
than just yourself.

491
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:08,457
Ever since we came here
and got these powers,

492
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:12,156
it has only caused pain,
suffering.

493
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,115
Made our lives more difficult.

494
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:17,466
We have been othered in
so many different ways, Andre.

495
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,208
And now this? They also help.

496
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,776
I can heal.

497
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:24,386
Your power has aided me
in the past.

498
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,345
But to what end?

499
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,825
You heal somebody,
but that makes you sick.

500
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:32,742
You're only gonna get sicker
unless you find some way

501
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,918
to release whatever is inside.

502
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:37,138
True.

503
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:39,140
But I doubt Claudette
would be up for

504
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:42,143
a damaged knee, even if
she were in town.

505
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,406
Andre, this isn't a joke.

506
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:51,544
Shanice, fair warning.

507
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:53,720
There's a rat behind you.

508
00:22:53,763 --> 00:22:55,069
What?!

509
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:56,897
Perhaps a solution.

510
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,942
Andre!

511
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:03,730
Oh. It worked.

512
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:26,405
Damn. Nothing from Jess?

513
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,426
I guess I gotta get used to her,
what, not texting me back?

514
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,975
You know what,
I know that I have been

515
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,499
hard on you about it,

516
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,259
but I really am sorry
that you two broke up.

517
00:23:35,283 --> 00:23:36,327
Are you?

518
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:38,199
Are you?

519
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:39,766
Hey, girl.

520
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:43,465
Soraya. Hello.

521
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:45,467
So I missed,

522
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,600
uh, raising a glass
to your untimely demise.

523
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:50,037
Hey, you got it worse than me.

524
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,473
They made you keep your job.

525
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:54,520
Okay.

526
00:23:54,563 --> 00:23:56,367
Is it weird for you that
Jessica canned your partner?

527
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:59,525
Uh, we just killed a bottle
trying to figure that out.

528
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:01,440
But, uh, the answer is no.

529
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:02,876
I mean, it's unacceptable.

530
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:04,593
She needs to be called out
for her behavior.

531
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:06,532
Okay. Attagirl.

532
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:08,447
See, J, you still got a partner.

533
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,623
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

534
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,625
That wasn't here before.

535
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:16,150
Manny was here.

536
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:18,326
Huh. He did this.

537
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:19,869
It's like the one you
showed me in the hotel,

538
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:21,982
but there's a one, two,
six, nine.

539
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:23,984
Oh, God, don't encourage him.

540
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:25,551
Come on, Keisha.

541
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:27,074
Like he knew that I got fired.

542
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:28,815
That is why
he left the clue here.

543
00:24:28,858 --> 00:24:30,338
Why wouldn't he
just reveal himself?

544
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:31,992
Why-why go through
these hoops? Preach.

545
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:33,820
Something must be wrong.

546
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:35,952
I don't know, maybe
he's in trouble or...

547
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:37,103
Maybe it's just
the Quantico speaking,

548
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:38,868
but if it is Manny...

549
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,088
And I'm not saying it is...

550
00:24:41,131 --> 00:24:42,761
Maybe he's trying
to get a message across.

551
00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:45,396
Like, maybe those numbers
correspond to letters.

552
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,702
Maybe it's a cypher.

553
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:47,810
You need to figure out
what the key is.

554
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:48,791
Something you would both know.

555
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:50,924
A cypher.

556
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:53,274
I mean, it'd be
more Manny's thing.

557
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:54,686
I-I wouldn't even know
where to start.

558
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,495
Well, maybe he's putting
his faith in you

559
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:59,280
to know him a little better
than you think you do.

560
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:02,109
Okay, um...

561
00:25:02,152 --> 00:25:03,937
Oh, we would leave
clocks in books

562
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,199
that we would read together.

563
00:25:05,242 --> 00:25:08,028
Maybe there's something
on page 1,269.

564
00:25:08,071 --> 00:25:10,509
I mean, I don't know
if we read anything that long,

565
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:12,511
but thank you.

566
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:17,994
Want to stay?

567
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:19,169
Round on me.

568
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:22,564
I should go home.

569
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:24,914
I already know I got
a long day tomorrow.

570
00:25:37,274 --> 00:25:40,408
Ah, no more patellar
disturbances I hope.

571
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:42,453
Don't come near me.
Keep your distance.

572
00:25:42,497 --> 00:25:44,823
Steve, what's wrong? Does your knee...
Because of your little stunt,

573
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:47,633
some park rando thought
I was one of you. A 4,400.

574
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:49,243
Not only did she call
the tip line,

575
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:51,419
she put my picture online,
and I got doxxed.

576
00:25:51,462 --> 00:25:53,726
Okay? And now I have people

577
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,989
harassing my family's
storefront again.

578
00:25:56,032 --> 00:25:58,339
You're not gonna be
another reason

579
00:25:58,382 --> 00:25:59,621
me and my family have
targets on our backs.

580
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:02,299
But you were in
so much distress,

581
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:04,084
and I know Miss LaDonna
would have wanted me

582
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:06,216
looking after... Don't
even talk about LaDonna!

583
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:09,263
Stay away from me.

584
00:26:11,874 --> 00:26:13,354
You are aware that

585
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:15,312
these conservatorships
don't apply to us?

586
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:16,986
We're not prisoners,
and you can't keep us...

587
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,142
Did you two try to exit the
premises despite it being

588
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:21,338
very clear we need to keep you
here for your own safety?

589
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:23,407
We would like to cross
the street to mail something.

590
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:25,235
We have every right to leave.

591
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,194
Any unlawful detainment... Like I said,

592
00:26:27,237 --> 00:26:29,675
it's not detainment,
it's public safety.

593
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:31,024
I'll take whatever it is.

594
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:32,503
Oh, no, ma'am.

595
00:26:32,547 --> 00:26:34,201
We're not gonna rely
on you for anything.

596
00:26:34,244 --> 00:26:36,769
I've tried that.
Look where it got us.

597
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:40,511
In fact, we are filing papers
to make this space a sanctuary.

598
00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:42,426
This time, you're not
gonna stop us.

599
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,385
Well, I hate
to burst your bubble,

600
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:46,256
but you'll need refugee status,

601
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,910
which is granted
by my department,

602
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:50,304
DHS, in order to be
given sanctuary

603
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:51,498
anywhere in the city of Detroit,

604
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:53,046
or anywhere else,
for that matter.

605
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:54,656
And we have filed
a comprehensive,

606
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,354
legally sound motion
to be granted such status

607
00:26:57,398 --> 00:26:59,530
as refugees out of time.

608
00:26:59,574 --> 00:27:02,446
That is very clever.

609
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:05,362
But there's a lot of red tape

610
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:06,862
with this kind of thing,
and we kind of have

611
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:08,627
our hands full,
as you might have noticed.

612
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,063
So it doesn't really matter

613
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:11,673
if you make it to the mailbox
or not.

614
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:14,763
Your whole gambit is pointless.

615
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:29,169
Keisha.

616
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:31,301
Hi.

617
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:34,348
What are you... You fired Jharrel?

618
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:40,441
Your friend Jharrel has been
a pain in my ass

619
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:43,183
since day one,
undermining my authority.

620
00:27:43,226 --> 00:27:45,881
I can't have that kind of
insubordination on my watch.

621
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:48,014
Men think they rule the world.

622
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:50,364
He's a good social worker.
He actually cares...

623
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:51,950
And you seem to care more
about me letting him go

624
00:27:51,974 --> 00:27:54,847
than about our breakup.

625
00:27:57,153 --> 00:27:58,198
I miss you.

626
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:03,464
How can you say that?

627
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:07,686
When you're keeping these
people detained in this hotel?

628
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,252
You want to talk
about your feelings?

629
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:10,732
You're treating them
like animals.

630
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:12,405
I'm treating them
like the threat they are.

631
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:14,257
Explain to me why

632
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:16,192
all of their blood panels came
back with matching anomalies?

633
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:19,698
I've seen firsthand the "people"
that we have at Ypsi Med,

634
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:22,701
like a man who can shoot fire,
who we thankfully contained,

635
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,790
or Mildred, for that matter,
who is still at large.

636
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,792
We've already gotten

637
00:28:26,835 --> 00:28:28,794
over 200 phone calls
off the tip line.

638
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:32,406
Well, why now?

639
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:34,756
You've already known about
their powers, about Ypsi Med.

640
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,192
Due to Gladys Keller's
broadcast,

641
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:37,735
we finally have the public
on our side.

642
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,805
A public that wants to know
that we are managing

643
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:41,632
a potential danger to society.

644
00:28:41,676 --> 00:28:45,027
A public that deserves
to feel safe and protected.

645
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:49,640
You wanted this to happen.

646
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:52,774
For people to feel scared.

647
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:55,516
Come on, Jess,
don't be that person.

648
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,518
I'm who I've always been.

649
00:28:57,561 --> 00:28:59,172
You're the one that's changed.

650
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:00,651
I've grown.

651
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:02,741
You can, too.
With a stroke of your pen,

652
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:04,960
you could stop this absurdity,
actually let the 4,400

653
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:06,832
have a proper sanctuary here.

654
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:09,138
Just let them be.

655
00:29:09,182 --> 00:29:11,750
Honestly, I'm surprised
that this is your position.

656
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,360
Your sister was murdered

657
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:14,641
because of someone
that shouldn't have been out

658
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:16,058
and was lethally dangerous.

659
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:18,495
Don't do that.

660
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,759
You don't bring my sister
into this mess,

661
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,388
like it changes the fact
that what you're doing...

662
00:29:22,412 --> 00:29:24,284
No, Keisha, what we'redoing.

663
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:30,159
What we're doing...

664
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:31,465
is wrong.

665
00:29:33,336 --> 00:29:35,904
I quit.

666
00:29:49,352 --> 00:29:52,051
So, this compiler
is cross-referencing

667
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:55,271
all those Ypsi Med files
with the COBOL code.

668
00:29:55,315 --> 00:29:57,665
I just hope that whatever this

669
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,406
compiler says

670
00:29:59,449 --> 00:30:01,408
frees us from suspicions.

671
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:02,844
Even Steve,

672
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:04,715
who's usually quite
keen and amiable,

673
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,892
accosted me over...

674
00:30:08,545 --> 00:30:11,810
Soraya, this tip line,

675
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:14,073
what's it for?

676
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:19,382
Well...

677
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:21,254
mostly, it's to

678
00:30:21,297 --> 00:30:24,387
instill fear,
create a chilling effect.

679
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:26,955
It weaponizes every person
on the street, with all their

680
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:29,479
misinformation and prejudices

681
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:31,830
and... hate.

682
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:34,310
But Steve? How could he think...

683
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:35,984
Anyone is susceptible,
given the right conditions.

684
00:30:36,008 --> 00:30:38,749
We all have to protect
ourselves sometimes,

685
00:30:38,793 --> 00:30:41,448
especially those of us
who stick out.

686
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:45,931
I'm sure this past year wasn't
easy for Steve and his family.

687
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:47,976
The anti-Asian hate

688
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,239
during COVID, it was awful,

689
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:51,980
and it still is.

690
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:54,678
I'm not saying
he's right, I just...

691
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:56,985
He's scared,

692
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:59,683
just like you are.

693
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:04,303
This whole thing is just not
as simple as we'd like it to be.

694
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:09,084
What's it say?

695
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:10,694
What's it all mean?

696
00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:12,218
Looks like the code has isolated

697
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:14,263
a particular property
found in 4,400 blood.

698
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:17,440
Something called... ZMT?

699
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:21,967
This is probably why
the mandated blood draws...

700
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,882
What is it?

701
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:25,884
I never practiced
with this knowledge,

702
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:28,756
nor do I recall any ZMT

703
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,908
appearing in any of the recent
literature I've been reading.

704
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:33,282
What could this mean?

705
00:31:33,326 --> 00:31:36,024
I don't know, but...

706
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:38,113
Do you trust me?

707
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,944
Can I look into this for you?
For the 4,400?

708
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:46,730
Of course. An ally of LaDonna's
is mine as well.

709
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:04,487
How is it that, lately, I've led

710
00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:06,794
my people down
such an atrocious path?

711
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:09,405
I have their best
interests at heart,

712
00:32:09,449 --> 00:32:11,538
but every action,
every decision I've made

713
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:13,279
has been the wrong one.

714
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:15,716
And on top of all that,

715
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,458
my power, it's...

716
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:20,808
It's of no use.

717
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:22,810
I'm literally
making us powerless

718
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:24,594
with a single touch.

719
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:27,554
I disagree.

720
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:29,773
It's why I came to talk to you.

721
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:33,690
I want you
to take away my power.

722
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:37,259
What? But why?

723
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:40,784
You call it my power,
but I feel... burdened.

724
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:42,699
I'm terrified to touch anyone,

725
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:44,353
even those closest to me,

726
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:46,790
or maybe those closest
to me most of all,

727
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:48,444
and-and I... we

728
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:50,316
never had a say in any of this.

729
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:53,493
These powers, they're gifts
from God, Shanice.

730
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:55,712
You've helped people,
even Ji-Eun the other day.

731
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:58,280
She didn't ask me to.

732
00:32:58,324 --> 00:33:01,501
And she didn't know.
I didn't know it would happen.

733
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:03,024
It-It's invasive.

734
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:04,330
It's wrong.

735
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:05,896
But that doesn't
give me the right.

736
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,594
I can't just take it from you.

737
00:33:07,637 --> 00:33:08,987
No, no, Your power isn't about

738
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,597
taking something away,
it's about

739
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,775
providing us with something
we were never given,

740
00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:15,994
a choice.

741
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,435
And I can give you that,

742
00:33:22,478 --> 00:33:24,524
a choice.

743
00:33:40,888 --> 00:33:44,326
But the Lord didn't bring us
here to flounder alone.

744
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:47,373
He gave us each other
and he gave...

745
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:53,814
Did it work?

746
00:33:54,989 --> 00:33:57,731
Yes.

747
00:33:57,774 --> 00:34:00,473
It did.

748
00:34:00,516 --> 00:34:01,909
Thank you.

749
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:04,912
I think it's finally gone.

750
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:18,273
I snuck out and
mailed the paperwork

751
00:34:18,317 --> 00:34:20,493
in for the sanctuary anyway,

752
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:23,148
because... well, you never know.

753
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:25,628
But if it's the powers
that gave the government

754
00:34:25,672 --> 00:34:28,022
the right to trigger
the conservatorships,

755
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,503
maybe we could file appeals
for those who choose...

756
00:34:30,546 --> 00:34:32,113
to get rid of them.Yeah.

757
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:35,247
Might take away their
justification for their...

758
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:42,167
- DHS property goes.
- Leave everything else.

759
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,782
Can you believe this?
The government is just leaving.

760
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:50,871
How did you manage this?

761
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:54,179
I don't... I don't know... Ah, my favorite

762
00:34:54,222 --> 00:34:57,617
co-conspirators.
Glad I caught you.

763
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,662
Here. Congratulations.

764
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:01,727
You've forced my hand
and made the hotel a sanctuary.

765
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:04,102
My department will be contesting

766
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:06,254
this new designation in court,
of course, you'll be tied up

767
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:08,149
in litigation for months, but

768
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:10,760
for now, it's all yours.

769
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:19,204
They gave us our refugees
through time status.

770
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:20,814
Why would she do this?

771
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:22,226
Do you think she had
a change of heart?

772
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,469
Even if she didn't,

773
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:24,905
at least we finally have

774
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:27,037
the U.S. government
off our backs.

775
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:29,127
We won.

776
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,390
We won.

777
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:36,177
What...

778
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:38,484
Hey.

779
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:48,537
We won the hotel, yes,
but now...

780
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:51,279
We're on our own.

781
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:10,080
Yo, Steve-o.

782
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:11,473
Over here.

783
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:14,911
Drink up. We're celebrating.

784
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:18,219
What's there to celebrate?
We all just lost our jobs.

785
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:19,612
What, you thinkl'd just

786
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:21,614
leave my guys out
in the cold? Come on.

787
00:36:21,657 --> 00:36:25,052
Okay. Sure, the hotel's
been shut down,

788
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:27,228
but there are still plenty more
of them out there,

789
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:28,534
out in the open.

790
00:36:28,577 --> 00:36:30,231
You see,
the government's looking

791
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:31,493
for good, honest folks like us

792
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:33,408
to start following leads,

793
00:36:33,452 --> 00:36:35,454
rounding them up
from the tip line. And it pays?

794
00:36:35,497 --> 00:36:38,587
Real money this time,
plus benefits.

795
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:41,024
No more of that
subcontract bull.

796
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:42,896
Yeah! Let's round them up!

797
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:48,858
You know, Steve-o,
you're one of the good ones,

798
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:51,513
I've got your back,
don't you worry.

799
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:57,519
Round them up. Hey, that's
what we like to hear.

800
00:37:18,192 --> 00:37:19,759
Oh, my God.

801
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:22,283
First of all,
this is kind of creepy.

802
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:24,285
Can we meet somewhere
with more lights next time?

803
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:25,808
You have what I asked for?

804
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:29,334
You'll find all the
stolen Ypsi Med files

805
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:30,683
on that thumb drive.

806
00:37:30,726 --> 00:37:32,815
No copies were made.

807
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:35,253
Anyone put together what
these files actually contain?

808
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:37,298
Just a recurring word, "ZMT."

809
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:39,039
What is ZMT, by the way?

810
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:43,696
All in due time.
Patience is a virtue after all.

811
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:45,654
Thank you

812
00:37:45,698 --> 00:37:47,090
for your service, Agent Abbas.

813
00:37:47,134 --> 00:37:48,440
I never doubted you
for a second.

814
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:51,834
Welcome to the inner circle.

815
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:04,586
So, uh, hooking up is one thing;

816
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,632
Having keys is
a whole other step.

817
00:38:06,675 --> 00:38:08,155
Okay, look,
I've just been getting.

818
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:10,288
Manny's stuff out of here
and watering her plants.

819
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:11,917
It's not like I'm keeping these
once she's back.

820
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:14,335
Yeah, I'll take that bet.
All right, so

821
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:15,554
what are we looking for?

822
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:17,643
Well...

823
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:25,215
This.

824
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:28,915
After striking out with
all the books at my place,

825
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:31,134
this is my last chance.

826
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:32,764
This box of Manny's books
that I left for Claudette.

827
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:34,181
Classics that she missed,

828
00:38:34,224 --> 00:38:36,836
or that time travel
skipped her over, I guess.

829
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:41,710
Of course.

830
00:38:41,754 --> 00:38:43,756
Time travel.

831
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:45,366
'Cause what is
the shortest distance

832
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,759
between two points,

833
00:38:46,802 --> 00:38:50,371
traveling through
the fifth dimension...

834
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:55,550
Like A Wrinkle in Time.

835
00:38:55,594 --> 00:38:58,988
Oh, my God, and there's
our code with a new number.

836
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:04,342
Manny used to be obsessed
with this book.

837
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:07,649
- He always identified with...
- Charles Wallace.

838
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:09,651
He would even call me Calvin

839
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:11,412
if I was too slow
in picking up whatever it was

840
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:14,352
he was trying to explain to me.

841
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:17,355
But there's not 1,269 pages

842
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:18,921
in this book.

843
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:20,405
Well, does the book
tell us anything?

844
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:22,055
About Manny, the codes, or...

845
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:24,623
What is it about?

846
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:26,407
I don't know. It's about...

847
00:39:26,451 --> 00:39:30,063
family and about
overcoming your fears,

848
00:39:30,106 --> 00:39:32,413
and always having faith
in one another. And that...

849
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:34,720
even if you
don't understand something,

850
00:39:34,763 --> 00:39:36,461
or you don't seek it,

851
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:38,854
even if it's
right in front of you,

852
00:39:38,898 --> 00:39:41,944
that doesn't mean
it doesn't exist. And, oh yeah,

853
00:39:41,988 --> 00:39:44,730
it's about time travel.

854
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:48,647
Good. Let's just observe 48,

855
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,997
for the time being.

856
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,651
No need to bring her in
just yet.

857
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:55,393
How's the transition going?

858
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:57,220
All in order,
thanks to my signature.

859
00:39:57,264 --> 00:40:00,093
Why did we grant them sanctuary?

860
00:40:00,136 --> 00:40:02,791
Sitting ducks. They'll think
they kicked us out,

861
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:04,967
but... With the world at large
seeing them

862
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:06,404
more and more as a threat,

863
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:07,816
they'll eventually
round themselves up.

864
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,798
And we'll know exactly
where they are.

865
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:14,412
We finally have cover
to make that arrest.

866
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:17,937
Good. Make sure he tells us
what we want to know.

867
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,417
I will.

868
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:24,291
Police. Open up.

869
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:27,120
Do you think someone called
Claudette in to the tip line?

870
00:40:27,163 --> 00:40:29,862
So help me,
if that's the case...

871
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:32,778
Jharrel Mateo? Yeah?

872
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:34,867
Hey, whoa. Hey!

873
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,497
Hey. What... Get off of him.
What the hell is going on?

874
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:37,846
There's got to be
some kind of mistake.

875
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,456
His warrant.
Theft of government property.

876
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,003
Keisha, you got to get Carla.

877
00:40:41,047 --> 00:40:42,720
She'll know what to do.
You got to get me out of this.

878
00:40:42,744 --> 00:40:44,572
Keisha! Someone
is setting me up.

879
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:46,531
Keisha! Get me out of this!
