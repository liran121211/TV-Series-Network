1
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:16,146
Rise and shine, Doc.

2
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:20,324
Oh, good. You're up.

3
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:21,519
Glad to see I'm not the only one

4
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:23,501
spinning their wheels
this early.

5
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:26,132
So, what have you discovered
about our superpowers,

6
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:27,636
Dr. Watson?

7
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,204
I see. You're Holmes, then?

8
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:31,205
Obviously.

9
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:33,076
Have you made any headway

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,296
deciphering that gibberish
we found in Manny's book?

11
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:36,906
No. Somehow, I'll need to find

12
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:39,691
a coding book to understand
what each line means.

13
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:41,606
I also wish I could check
my FOMOSnap

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,913
to see if my video
made it out to the world.

15
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:46,394
I may have leaked

16
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:48,502
a little something to show
what it's really like in here.

17
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:51,268
You know, hopefully get us out.

18
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:52,672
But we have to keep this
on the DL.

19
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,794
The down-low.

20
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:59,407
Just keep this
between us, okay? Understood.

21
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,061
Okay, great. Now,

22
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:03,019
I've been tracking time lines,

23
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,544
since the abilities seem
to emerge somewhat randomly.

24
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:08,044
I'd also like to understand
if the abilities

25
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,504
have any effect on the body.

26
00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:11,593
Okay.Now...

27
00:01:11,636 --> 00:01:15,075
what do you say to
a little experiment?

28
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,816
Sure. Why not?

29
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,036
I'd simply like to assess
your baseline vitals

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,735
while at rest and then again
when you are using your ability.

31
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:27,565
Okay. I'll have to use my 1920s
methods to record all this

32
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:29,915
until I can get access
to proper equipment.

33
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:34,311
Now try one of your illusions,

34
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:36,008
and I shall take
your pulse again.

35
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:46,758
What was all of that?

36
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:48,301
Oh, just some stuff
from Grey's Anatomy.

37
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:50,545
I never saw any of that
in my copy.

38
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:53,113
You must have read
a more modern edition.

39
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:58,640
All of that spectacular display

40
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:00,337
and your heart rate
slowed somehow.

41
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:02,818
Fascinating.

42
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:04,080
I am determined

43
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,386
that, together,

44
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:06,778
we can solve what is surely

45
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:08,476
the greatest of all mysteries:

46
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:10,956
These abilities
some of us possess.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,263
For now,

48
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:16,179
we'll keep them on the DL?

49
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:18,442
Yeah.

50
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:20,140
Okay, everyone, simmer down.

51
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:23,230
I'm sure you've heard
about the leaked video.

52
00:02:23,273 --> 00:02:25,425
Hell, at this point, it seems
the whole world has seen it.

53
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:26,557
Okay, so they're gonna
do something about

54
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,626
the conditions in here, right?

55
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,889
The conditions were
exaggerated by that video,

56
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,369
which helped no one.

57
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:33,781
The FBI is currently
investigating the leak

58
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:35,067
and will act accordingly.

59
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:37,200
That video showed the truth.

60
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:39,028
What the public is upset about

61
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:40,788
is that these people are
being treated like prisoners.

62
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:42,597
The plan has always been
to release them.

63
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,946
In fact, given the video,

64
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:45,600
we are moving up the timetable.

65
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:47,471
We're letting them out?

66
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:49,212
We are rolling
out a pilot program,

67
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:51,214
Project Reintegration,
to get some of our folks

68
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:52,955
out into the world.

69
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:55,218
We will be allowing
a select few out for a day trip

70
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:57,351
here in Detroit. This is
just another PR stunt.

71
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:58,850
The mayor's office
will be helping us coordinate

72
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:00,832
some minor press
around the event, yes,

73
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:02,269
but this is a stepping stone.

74
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:04,227
No, it is parading them

75
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:06,664
around for cameras
like animals in a zoo.

76
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:07,989
Would you rather
we never let them out?

77
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:10,320
The world is aware of them.

78
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:12,235
So make sure
that it goes smoothly,

79
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,952
and they'll all be
getting out soon enough.

80
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:15,693
Yeah, but what about the fact
these people claim

81
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:17,414
to have traveled through time?

82
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,938
The public, and, honestly,
even some of the people

83
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:22,506
who work here,
have other theories, too.

84
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,727
Like aliens or sleeper-cell
terrorists or...

85
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,511
Are we disproving
any of these theories?

86
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:29,383
Right.
All we can do

87
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:30,882
is show the public that
we've been careful to ensure

88
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:32,144
that they're not
a threat to society.

89
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:33,648
Other than that,

90
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:35,606
we can neither
confirm nor deny anything.

91
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,174
That is the official party line
until further notice.

92
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,438
And I expect you all
to hold that line.

93
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:47,618
Hey.

94
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:48,942
So I hear
we might be getting out

95
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,491
earlier than expected.

96
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:53,755
Some kind of video or something?

97
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:55,147
Heads up.

98
00:03:56,975 --> 00:04:00,022
Thank you all for gathering.

99
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:01,632
We have some good
news to share today.

100
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:03,286
Tomorrow we launch

101
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,333
what we are calling
Project Reintegration,

102
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,422
a stepping stone
in your release.

103
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:13,601
Now, it's only gonna be

104
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:15,690
a few of you from this
facility for now.

105
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:18,954
But a number of other facilities
will be participating as well.

106
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:22,131
And it's gonna start
with one day out.

107
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:23,959
One day?
It-it's a start.

108
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:26,918
It's a step in the
right direction.

109
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:29,573
The hope is, eventually,
everyone will get out.

110
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:31,140
I would like to be
one of the first,

111
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:33,621
so that I might visit
a modern medical facility.

112
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:35,666
It would help me
to better utilize my skills,

113
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,146
and to be of real service.

114
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,539
I hear you, Dr. Davis.

115
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:41,106
But unfortunately, for now,

116
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,108
we can only let out
a few at a time,

117
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:45,110
and those four have
already been selected

118
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,262
at random by the government.

119
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,375
Random, my ass.

120
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:49,941
They are not gonna pick me.

121
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:51,397
And they've already
called me a troublemaker

122
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:53,684
for playing a piano.
Okay.

123
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:56,861
Those folks will be getting
the first day passes will be

124
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:57,993
Isaiah Johnston...

125
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:01,344
Shanice Murray,

126
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,955
LaDonna Landry

127
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:06,349
and Claudette Williams.

128
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:09,309
If this goes well, they say that
you'll all be getting released.

129
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:10,571
And we are gonna do our best

130
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:12,529
to ensure that that happens.

131
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,492
Look, I heard you in there.

132
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:21,538
So, I figured
you could work from here.

133
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:25,063
Well? What do you think?

134
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:28,676
Huh. Looks like it's seen some
festivities back in the day.

135
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:30,939
But why are we here?

136
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:32,636
Well, it's the old hotel bar.

137
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,725
This is just so you can
have a little space to...

138
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,423
I don't know, spread out.

139
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,425
Not have to work from home.

140
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:41,079
Trust me, we all
got sick of that.

141
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:45,867
This is a space, yes,
but what about equipment?

142
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,914
What about access to a lab,
or modern advances in medicine?

143
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:53,048
Look, I know you want to be
out there in the world today.

144
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:54,832
Okay? I want that for you, too.

145
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:56,530
But keep your head down,

146
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,377
and hopefully you'll get
picked for the next day out.

147
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,838
Please, don't insult
my intelligence.

148
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:02,840
Shanice and Claudette
most certainly

149
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:04,364
did not keep their heads down.

150
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:06,191
You must know
that their selection

151
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:07,758
doesn't make any sense.

152
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,413
Yeah, I do.

153
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:12,372
I'll put in a word

154
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:13,895
for you to be on the list
next time.

155
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:16,898
Please do put in a word
to allow me my freedom.

156
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:21,206
Just two weeks ago
I was conducting research

157
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,861
that was going
to change the world.

158
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:33,044
Old Dr. Weavers

159
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:34,959
would be diddling away
in obscurity

160
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:37,353
if I was not there
each night to check

161
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,138
and double-check our results.

162
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:43,751
We cured seven of our ten rats
all because of my diligence.

163
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:48,538
Poor little things, you made
them sick just to cure them.

164
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:50,235
And cure

165
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,803
I did.

166
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:55,937
It is all for science, my dear.

167
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,637
Knowing that my research
will cure bronchial infections,

168
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:03,466
well, that is something
for the books.

169
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,859
And it will only enhance

170
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:09,341
my residency status
at our very own hospital

171
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:11,866
in our own neighborhood.

172
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:14,999
Here's to our own Dr. Davis,

173
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:18,307
proving that the Negro doctor
has indeed arrived.

174
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,700
Hear, hear.

175
00:07:19,743 --> 00:07:21,049
Just be careful

176
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:22,964
at that Harlem Hospital.

177
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:24,855
I hear the nurses dorm
has all sorts of lovelies

178
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,358
to get you in trouble.

179
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:27,490
Oh, no, no. My man does not

180
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:29,492
have time for all of that.

181
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:31,451
Do you, Doctor?

182
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:34,584
Come on in here. Dance with me.

183
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:46,640
Okay?

184
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:56,040
Are you quite done with all

185
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:57,302
the work discussion?

186
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:01,176
Better?

187
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:04,721
This is the first
night you haven't slept

188
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:07,051
in that dank lab in a while.

189
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:09,663
You keep promising me we'll see
Gladys play at Hansberry's

190
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:12,100
and do some real dancing.

191
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:14,058
Mm. When?

192
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:16,974
Soon, my love, soon.

193
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:19,194
My work is important, Cynthia.

194
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:21,152
Just you wait,

195
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:23,677
it'll all be worth it,
those nights in the lab.

196
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,200
I promise.

197
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:33,730
Hey, I have to run, Doc.

198
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:35,863
I hope this space helps
until it's your turn.

199
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:42,609
Soraya texted you, too? Yeah.

200
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:43,977
Said she found something
on the Belle Isle footage.

201
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:45,829
Whoa, what... Step aside.

202
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:48,484
I didn't do anything. I don't
know what any of this is about.

203
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,790
Yo, what is going on here?

204
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,574
Why is she in handcuffs?

205
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:52,706
I didn't do anything.

206
00:08:57,624 --> 00:08:59,887
Hey. What's going
on with Soraya?

207
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,038
Why'd she just get
hauled out of here

208
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,803
like public enemy number one?

209
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:04,631
Yeah, forensics ran sweeps
on our computers,

210
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:07,155
and hers was the only one with
access to the leaked footage.

211
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:08,765
You think she leaked that video?

212
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:10,680
Why? I don't know.

213
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:12,160
Honestly, it's just
one less thing

214
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:13,509
hanging over my head right now.

215
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,510
Can you do me a favor
and make sure

216
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,772
nothing goes wrong tomorrow?

217
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:17,513
And Keisha's already met

218
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,298
with Claudette and Shanice
about where they'd like to go.

219
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:24,041
So would you like us
to contact family for you both?

220
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:26,000
We can probably get them
out here in time.

221
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:28,655
I do hope to reach out
eventually.

222
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:30,178
But I want to learn

223
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:31,701
what I can about what's happened

224
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:33,660
in these intervening years
before I do.

225
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:35,226
I owe my son that much.

226
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,098
Okay.

227
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:38,708
How about you, LaDonna?

228
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:41,624
Your mom's been reaching out.

229
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:44,061
Um, no, that's okay.

230
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:45,367
Seems like a whole hassle.

231
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,934
But maybe next time.

232
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:49,023
I a... I actually was
thinking a library.

233
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:50,546
The library?

234
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,939
Really? Wh... Yeah.

235
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:53,767
I mean, I need to,
you know, brush up

236
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,073
on fashion and gossip
that I missed.

237
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:57,597
I'd enjoy that.

238
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,424
And I'd like to go
to a house of God.

239
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:01,992
I hear Detroit has
some beautiful old churches.

240
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:05,648
Okay.

241
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:07,607
Let's do this.

242
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,348
Where's Dr. Andre?

243
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:12,046
I don't know,

244
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,449
but you want to see
something cool?

245
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:23,927
I kind of did it to Shanice's
ankle monitor by accident

246
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:26,669
when we were hanging out,
and no one came to get her.

247
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:30,760
Now she can just take it off
and on whenever she wants,

248
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:32,806
and the guards can't tell.

249
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:36,984
Ah, wonderful.

250
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:38,550
You're both here.

251
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:40,901
I hope to have your
help in figuring out

252
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:42,903
why some of us have powers,

253
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:44,644
why some of us don't

254
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:45,775
and how they all work.

255
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:47,864
Sounds groovy.

256
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,694
Let us take
a baseline pulse first.

257
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:56,438
I was born this way.

258
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:58,048
It wasn't an accident.

259
00:10:58,092 --> 00:10:59,441
All right.

260
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:02,444
So, what kind
of a doctor were you?

261
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:05,839
I was a medic in the Great War.

262
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:08,711
When I returned, I ran a clinic,

263
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:12,846
but then I began focusing on
respiratory and bronchial issues

264
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,891
in my research.

265
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:17,328
It was most groundbreaking.

266
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:19,069
It was indeed

267
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:21,245
a splendid affair,

268
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:24,509
and I raised
the remaining funds needed

269
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:25,685
to move us to human trials.

270
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,557
And would you believe,

271
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,013
they loved the story
of how that last rat

272
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:31,821
was the final subject I cured.

273
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:34,868
I even told them

274
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:37,392
that it was my assistant
that named him Gustavo.

275
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:41,091
With all due respect, sir,
I would appreciate you

276
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:43,311
not referring to me
as your assistant.

277
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:46,923
Andre, focus on what matters.

278
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:50,492
We are so very close
to curing whooping cough,

279
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:51,975
and eventually
all bronchial diseases

280
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:54,452
with this new chemical medicine.

281
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:56,803
We both know it's the work

282
00:11:56,846 --> 00:11:58,718
that truly matters. And we both know

283
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:01,546
I am the one in the lab
all hours.

284
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,766
I am the one
taking the calculations

285
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,073
and refining the treatment.

286
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:08,031
I should receive
the credit I deserve.

287
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:11,339
Andre, you should be pleased
I mentioned you

288
00:12:11,382 --> 00:12:12,775
in the first place.

289
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:16,126
Till tomorrow.

290
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:24,047
Earth to Andre.

291
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:25,919
Ah. Yes.

292
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:28,530
My apologies, Shanice.
I'm just, uh...

293
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:29,879
Focused on your work.

294
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:31,402
Yeah.

295
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:35,406
Any insights
into these... powers?

296
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,408
Not as much as I'd like.

297
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:39,497
If I could just get access
to what I need,

298
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,413
I know I could find answers,
but my hands are tied.

299
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:44,415
I know it's frustrating,

300
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,548
but you don't have
to solve it all right away.

301
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:48,332
That's easy for you to say.

302
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:50,465
You're allowed out in the world,

303
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:52,225
instead of being trapped in
here like a rat in a cage.

304
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:54,425
And a useless one at that. Look, I know.

305
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:55,905
It's not fair.

306
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:57,602
I tried to stand up
for you, too,

307
00:12:57,646 --> 00:12:59,517
when we met up with Keisha... I know.

308
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:01,171
It is appreciated.

309
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:07,482
Are you certain about
not seeing your daughter

310
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:09,745
on your first official outing?

311
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,139
I am not certain of anything.

312
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:16,883
I feel like I barely made things
right between us, and...

313
00:13:16,926 --> 00:13:19,581
I don't want
to mess it up again.

314
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:22,149
And I don't know who I am

315
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,847
to Mariah or Logan.

316
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:27,850
It's been 16 years for them.

317
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:30,853
He's remarried.

318
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:33,943
But I was just married to him
two weeks ago.

319
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:36,554
Am I just supposed
to flip a switch?

320
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,867
Uh, please,

321
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:47,957
enjoy your time with,
uh, your Mrs. Grover.

322
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:50,525
Thanks.

323
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:52,024
Yeah, I think Claudette
will enjoy meeting her, too.

324
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:53,876
All right. Well,
do come and see me

325
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,660
when you get back,

326
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,344
so that I can add your
data to my records.

327
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,580
Will do, Doc.

328
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:18,640
Feel a little more
normal already.

329
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:21,556
I'm really not sure this skirt
is at all appropriate.

330
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,123
Well, they did offer you pants.

331
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,689
If we're going to see live music

332
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:26,517
after visiting your
Mrs. Grover like I asked,

333
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:28,519
I am not wearing pants to dance.

334
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:29,912
You can bet
your business on that.

335
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:32,262
There is a lot

336
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,916
of people out there.

337
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,178
What do they want?

338
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:36,701
A spectacle.

339
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,921
Maybe I should just
sneak out again.

340
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:42,403
You know what?

341
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:43,946
We don't have to feed
everyone to the wolves.

342
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,362
Excuse me?

343
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:47,060
Yeah? Can you escort these two

344
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:48,559
to the loading docks where
there's no press or cameras?

345
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,411
Roger. This way.

346
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:52,369
Thank you.

347
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:54,371
Uh, what are you doing?

348
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:56,765
Our details are out front.

349
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:59,942
Did you see them?
They don't want to do this.

350
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:02,640
Do you really think going rogue
is a good idea?

351
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:04,120
Look what they did to Soraya

352
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:05,532
because they think
she leaked the video.

353
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:07,099
Do you really think
taking a different exit

354
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:08,622
is gonna make them
throw the book at us?

355
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:11,911
Yes. My public is here.

356
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:14,609
You okay with this?

357
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,742
It'll be good
for them to see us,

358
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:20,136
to realize we belong out there.

359
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:23,574
Let's go.

360
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:32,453
Hi!

361
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:36,848
Oh, yeah! Who's good?

362
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:46,380
So, this is Detroit, huh?

363
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:47,859
I barely recognize it.

364
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:52,081
It's... it's different.

365
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,954
There's... more.

366
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:58,174
I love this city, but...

367
00:15:58,218 --> 00:15:59,697
I'll have to get
to know it again.

368
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:01,917
All this,

369
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,615
the cars and-and the people,

370
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:06,443
and the buildings.

371
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:08,010
Oh, I never imagined.

372
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:09,838
It's better than
what you imagined?

373
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:11,840
Different.

374
00:16:11,883 --> 00:16:14,103
Y'all aren't faking this.

375
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:16,453
No, we never lied
about what happened to us.

376
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:18,978
You really are from 1958,

377
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,980
aren't you?

378
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:39,128
Neecey!

379
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:43,393
And friends.

380
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,134
Y'all come on in.

381
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:47,354
I made a batch of my famous
Grover's Mules.

382
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:50,139
Come on. You, too.

383
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:51,662
Come on.

384
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,670
LaDonna, lovely
to see you again.

385
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:01,759
And Reverend Johnston, hi,
I'm Carla Coleman

386
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:03,302
from the mayor's office,
comms director.

387
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:06,068
Let's get a quick photo
of you both

388
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:07,548
in front of this
signage over here.

389
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,091
And then I'm thinking
we just grab some candids

390
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:10,875
around the library
as you go about your business.

391
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:12,205
Sound good? Yes, ma'am.

392
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:13,597
Thank you very much.

393
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:15,991
So, I was actually wondering

394
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,906
if they were gonna
use you for this.

395
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:19,908
Hmm. Okay, be honest.

396
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:23,781
Don't you feel a little,
uh, goofy babysitting

397
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:25,305
some grown adults in a library?

398
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:27,437
Oh, I feel
completely ridiculous.

399
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:30,440
But the only person
I'm here to babysit is you.

400
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,681
So you're still holding my press
conference meltdown against me?

401
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:37,186
Well, I saved your job,
didn't I?

402
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,362
You did.

403
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:41,016
Thank you, CC.

404
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,062
Well...

405
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,194
I know you care
about these people.

406
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:47,936
I'm just hoping this can help.

407
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:49,894
Maybe we should take,
like, a laughing one.

408
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:54,856
You know, the Carla I knew
was gonna be a journalist,

409
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:56,684
someone who would
seek out the truth

410
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,468
regardless of what the cost.

411
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:02,559
We were gonna fight the man
together, now you are the man.

412
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:03,865
What happened?

413
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:06,215
Real life happened, Jharrel.

414
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,695
You know this is how it works.

415
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:09,064
And I'm sorry,
some of us need a paycheck

416
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:09,871
and can't afford
to go running our mouths

417
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:11,438
whenever we feel like it.

418
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:13,242
Look, no, I didn't mean that...
Yeah, you did.

419
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:15,877
You always think
you're the only one who cares.

420
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,009
Let's just get this over with.

421
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,194
Young Hayden.

422
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:29,543
I was waiting for you.

423
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:30,674
It's your turn, remember?

424
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:35,810
I just don't like being
poked and prodded.

425
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:38,508
Or strapped down.

426
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:41,685
I can assure you, I won't
be doing any of that.

427
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:46,995
I'm trying to figure
this out for all of us,

428
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:51,130
so that we can understand
and control these powers.

429
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:55,960
Did Mildred tell you
we made great progress?

430
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:58,485
She's coming in for further
observation later today.

431
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:05,231
I-I just had a vision.

432
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:07,189
May I?

433
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:12,542
All right.

434
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:15,154
Tell me about it.

435
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:20,028
Yeah, um...

436
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:24,511
I was holding some flowers
that I think

437
00:19:24,554 --> 00:19:26,208
were for Mildred.

438
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:27,383
That sounds lovely.

439
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:31,909
I mean, she was
my first... kiss.

440
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:35,130
It was nice, but...

441
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,394
I've never had a girlfriend.

442
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:40,353
Is this how it feels?

443
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:41,615
How about this?

444
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:44,879
You help me with my research,

445
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:47,360
and I shall teach you
what I know about women.

446
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:50,232
I will even teach you
how to dance.

447
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:51,755
Dance? Mm-hmm.

448
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,279
I don't know.

449
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:55,324
Oh, every woman

450
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:57,544
loves to dance. Baby, won't you please.

451
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:02,331
You were right, my love.

452
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,072
This is just the work break
I needed.

453
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:08,294
You know, I love our
little breaks,

454
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:10,315
but maybe next time, don't
bring all your work home

455
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:12,646
in the first place?

456
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:15,126
I brought my work home

457
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,346
because I'm tired of being

458
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,740
under Dr. Weavers' thumb
all the time.

459
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,196
I'm on the verge of
a breakthrough... Ah!

460
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,675
Silly me. I thought
you brought it home

461
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:25,615
to spend more time with me.

462
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:30,185
But I never get to see you.
You're always puttering

463
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,666
and moving about, never resting.

464
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:36,409
How's this...

465
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:37,627
for moving about?

466
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,629
All right, Doctor.

467
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:49,441
Well, how long have you
had this cough?

468
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:51,989
Is there any blood, too? My love...

469
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:54,992
it's nothing, I promise.

470
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:56,951
I just got a little excited.

471
00:20:56,994 --> 00:21:00,694
Co-Come back to me.

472
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,747
Yo, Isaiah, you doing all right?

473
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,228
Is it possible to find
someone on this thing?

474
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,664
Where they are?

475
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,188
Yeah. Who you looking for?

476
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:18,842
I just want to see
what happened to my

477
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:20,670
family's church after I left.

478
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:23,673
I got you. All right, use this.

479
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:25,458
Search for yourself

480
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:27,286
or your family.

481
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:31,638
Right.

482
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:33,901
Okay, maybe try adding
"Reverend" in front,

483
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:36,295
and/or "Chicago"
to narrow down the search.

484
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:51,571
Hey, you two.

485
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:54,530
So, what'd you find? Oh, yeah.

486
00:21:54,574 --> 00:21:55,681
Uh, you know, just my ticket
to the trends

487
00:21:55,705 --> 00:21:56,837
in fashion that I missed.

488
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,075
Speaking of that, so I saw that

489
00:21:58,099 --> 00:21:59,622
the '90s and '70s
are coming back,

490
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,363
like, all at once;
Seriously, what gives?

491
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:04,540
I really couldn't say.

492
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:06,264
How about we get those
checked out for you?

493
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:18,859
Of course you found a way
to profit from my death.

494
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:36,485
I held my breath
as Michelle and Barack

495
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:37,921
strolled down that boulevard.

496
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,751
Oh, she looked so beautiful.

497
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:44,754
And he's a handsome man.Mm-hmm.

498
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:46,060
So handsome.Mm.

499
00:22:46,103 --> 00:22:48,105
Aretha Franklin performed,

500
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:50,281
and then Beyoncé for his second.

501
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:52,414
What, from Destiny's Child? Oh, no, child.

502
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,025
We way beyond that now.

503
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:56,549
We in the era

504
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:59,290
of Black Lady Excellence.

505
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:01,336
Or so the kids call it.

506
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:06,559
I can't believe I missed
witnessing all of this.

507
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:10,127
All the hard work that
brought us to this point.

508
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:12,303
Well, you're here
to witness it now.

509
00:23:12,347 --> 00:23:15,350
And be a part of it.
Cheers, ladies.Cheers.

510
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,134
Uh, maybe they should
switch to water.

511
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:19,485
Maybe theycan make
their own decisions

512
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:20,703
about what theydrink.

513
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:28,450
I'm going to make
a call outside.

514
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:34,717
Now, now, you two.

515
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:37,633
She's just doing her job.

516
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:39,306
Did she tell you
what happened to you all?

517
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,420
We don't know what they think.

518
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:44,161
They're not telling us anything.

519
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:46,599
And there are a few things

520
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:48,427
that we aren't
telling them, either.

521
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:51,995
I-I am not sure

522
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,344
I fully understand it.

523
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,480
Well, spit it out, Neecey.

524
00:24:01,614 --> 00:24:05,618
Well, ever since we came back,

525
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:08,664
many of us have powers.

526
00:24:10,753 --> 00:24:12,842
Superpowers.

527
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:21,329
So, let me get this straight.

528
00:24:21,372 --> 00:24:24,375
You're saying that
when you touch someone,

529
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,769
you see their memories?

530
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:30,643
Well, it only happened once
with Mariah, and...

531
00:24:30,686 --> 00:24:33,602
I don't even really
know how I did it, or...

532
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:35,212
Okay, then,

533
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:36,562
what did you see?

534
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:40,348
I saw...

535
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:46,485
I saw her call Bridget "Mom."

536
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,704
Tell her that she loves her.

537
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:51,359
Neecey,

538
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:53,492
Bridget's been there
taking care of her

539
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:57,017
most of her life. I know.

540
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,279
I know that.

541
00:24:58,322 --> 00:25:00,194
Give it some time.

542
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:02,326
This whole situation is
all kinds of strange.

543
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,068
But I was just... It seems to me

544
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:07,984
you've got to stop
focusing on the past.

545
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:12,423
Be in the present.
Figure that out first.

546
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:13,947
Then you can figure out

547
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,037
how you want to
move forward with them.

548
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,430
They might just surprise you.

549
00:25:19,474 --> 00:25:22,346
She's got a point there,
Shanice.

550
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,435
Now, do you see memories, too?

551
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:27,395
No, I...

552
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:37,710
and thank God I wasn't
raised by that man.

553
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:40,060
I was given a legacy
before I was even born,

554
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:42,758
and it's a legacy
that I don't want.

555
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:46,545
This conversation, reparative
therapy, is the real sin.

556
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,721
There is nothing to repair.

557
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:50,940
We have always been here
and always will...

558
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,991
Hey, man.

559
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,170
It's time to go.

560
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:04,998
Okay. I'll meet you outside.

561
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:14,921
Hey, what's up?

562
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:16,400
How's it going over there?

563
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:18,011
So far, so good.

564
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:20,100
Just finishing up
with a few more pics.

565
00:26:20,143 --> 00:26:21,841
Kind of the same here.

566
00:26:21,884 --> 00:26:24,626
Nothing out of the ordinary.

567
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,933
I have to admit it does
seem pretty normal.

568
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:29,283
Like they should be
out in the world.

569
00:26:29,326 --> 00:26:31,111
Catching up on it all, I guess.

570
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:33,635
Ah. Okay, see,
I like this Keisha.

571
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,986
But trust me, these people are
just like you and me.

572
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,509
In a situation
beyond their control.

573
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:44,211
I have to go.

574
00:26:56,832 --> 00:26:58,355
Everything all right?

575
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:04,100
That was very good,
Miss Mildred. Now...

576
00:27:04,144 --> 00:27:06,842
let's increase
the level of difficulty.

577
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:11,412
What do you think
they're doing out there?

578
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:15,024
Enjoying having the freedom
to do as they wish, I suppose.

579
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:20,900
I don't think I want to go.

580
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:25,905
I have Hayden and Shanice,

581
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:28,342
and a whole room to myself.

582
00:27:28,385 --> 00:27:30,387
It's not so bad. I see.

583
00:27:31,824 --> 00:27:33,347
Now.

584
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,305
Do try to lift these bottles up,

585
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:37,786
all at once. I want to see

586
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,354
if our results change
with several heavier objects.

587
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:43,923
Keep them floating
as I check your pulse.

588
00:27:48,362 --> 00:27:49,929
Good!

589
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:00,940
Amazing.

590
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:04,291
Look.

591
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,600
I can't!

592
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,488
So you just gave him a place
to do experiments,

593
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:28,924
unguarded? I...

594
00:28:28,968 --> 00:28:31,100
To, like, study and stuff.

595
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:32,687
Hell, I didn't think it was
that big of a deal.

596
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,408
Well, Jessica is pissed.

597
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:36,062
It was a freak accident.

598
00:28:36,105 --> 00:28:37,561
We're on a path to
getting these people out,

599
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:40,980
and there's still so much
we don't know.

600
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:42,546
Oh, come on.

601
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,270
Did anything go wrong
on your outing today?

602
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,813
No.

603
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:50,816
Nothing went wrong, but...

604
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:52,905
But they're from the past.

605
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:56,604
What could that possibly mean?
I don't know.

606
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:59,128
It is something unexplainable.

607
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:01,870
We still don't know what's
going on with Soraya

608
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:04,481
or the thing on Belle Isle.

609
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:06,788
Or how this freak
accident happened.

610
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:08,659
Trust me, I know, but...

611
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:14,100
But let's just
take the win today.

612
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:17,538
All right? We took some of these
people out, and it went well.

613
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:24,588
So you think Keisha saw
my hand heal?

614
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:26,721
So stupid of me
showing off like that.

615
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,723
I don't think so,
or Miss By-The-Book

616
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,637
would have said something.

617
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,422
Hey, hey, hey.

618
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:33,684
Did y'all hear about Mildred?

619
00:29:33,728 --> 00:29:35,251
They sent her to Ypsi Med.Yeah.

620
00:29:35,295 --> 00:29:37,036
Dr. Davis did something wild.

621
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:39,081
Destroyed the old bar.
I heard it was dope.

622
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:42,258
I mean bad.
Shattered glass everywhere.

623
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:45,305
Is Mildred okay? And Andre?

624
00:29:45,348 --> 00:29:46,436
We don't know.

625
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,135
We're waiting to hear back.

626
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:51,050
All right, get ready.

627
00:29:51,093 --> 00:29:53,661
You guys are like astronauts
coming back from the moon.

628
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:59,058
What's going on?

629
00:29:59,101 --> 00:30:01,190
You find out anything
about your son?

630
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:04,672
I have no son.

631
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,241
Oh, my...

632
00:30:18,686 --> 00:30:20,253
She was fine
the last time I saw her,

633
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:21,776
and now she's gone.

634
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,865
What did you do to her?!

635
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:26,389
Hayden!
I'll make sure she's okay.

636
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:28,000
And how will you do that?

637
00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:30,567
You don't care about us.

638
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:32,874
All you care about is
your experiments.

639
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:35,529
If you really cared,
Millie would still be here.

640
00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:37,879
I told you
I didn't trust doctors,

641
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:39,446
and you proved me right.

642
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:49,630
He's really upset
about Mildred, isn't he?

643
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:53,634
You okay?

644
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,484
Well... well, here, Doc.
These should cheer you up.

645
00:30:58,508 --> 00:31:00,308
I got some of the medical
books you asked for.

646
00:31:00,336 --> 00:31:03,513
I got 1924 to 1930.

647
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:05,472
Disguised them as
fashion magazines

648
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:07,256
to hide them from
Big Brother, of course.

649
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,911
Another DL operation, I presume?

650
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:12,087
You know it.
And I also got myself

651
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:15,438
a coding book, and an actual
fashion magazine.

652
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:17,571
Oh, my God, these,
like, lockdown looks.

653
00:31:17,614 --> 00:31:19,965
The amount of high-end
loungewear and slippers

654
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:21,444
is ridiculous.

655
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:24,491
And, like, designer
surgical masks? Mm-mm.

656
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:27,102
It looks like we lucked out
missing all that.

657
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:30,366
I did it.

658
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,064
What'd you do?

659
00:31:39,288 --> 00:31:42,161
I... have the most
wonderful news.

660
00:31:42,204 --> 00:31:45,120
What is all this?

661
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:47,296
I convinced Dr. Weavers...

662
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,691
to give you a spot
in our human trials.

663
00:31:50,734 --> 00:31:53,737
I even asked him to assign you
our lucky number seven.

664
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:55,957
We've been over this, Andre.

665
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:57,611
I'm not one of your
little guinea pigs

666
00:31:57,654 --> 00:31:59,743
for something that's untested.

667
00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:02,224
But it is tested.
My treatment works.

668
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:03,922
Your data will add to the others

669
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:04,923
and help with the cure.

670
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:08,535
Now, Gustavo here is...

671
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:11,190
Andre, you did not bring
that vermin into my house!

672
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:12,713
I mean it, you need to

673
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:15,411
get all of this out of here now.

674
00:32:15,455 --> 00:32:17,022
This is where we live, Andre.

675
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:23,158
Cynthia, my love...

676
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,161
Just listen.

677
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:29,860
I know you are scared.

678
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:31,862
And I am very worried
for what might happen

679
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:33,429
if you don't get this treatment.

680
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:36,171
My work will cure you.
I know it will.

681
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:38,130
You have to trust me.

682
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:44,310
Dr. Andre's not what
I need right now.

683
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:47,704
I need my loving partner,
my sweet man

684
00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:49,880
to just be here for me.

685
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:52,318
Don't you understand
the importance of this work?

686
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:53,797
Work?!

687
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:55,843
Is that what I am to you,
just work?

688
00:32:55,886 --> 00:32:58,193
This cure will save the world.

689
00:32:58,237 --> 00:33:00,065
It's not just about you.
Don't be selfish.

690
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:09,030
Mm-hmm. I think that we need
a bit of space, Andre.

691
00:33:09,074 --> 00:33:11,380
I'm going over to my sister's,

692
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,165
and you can have
this whole damn place

693
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:15,123
to do your work.

694
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:18,083
Cynthia, my love. Please, wait.

695
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:36,753
I brought you your usual.

696
00:33:36,797 --> 00:33:40,105
Surprised you wanted
to meet up with sellout.

697
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:42,933
Look, I'm sorry about before.

698
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:47,242
I know I should just be happy

699
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:48,765
these people are getting out.

700
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:50,680
Not be so concerned
with the how.

701
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:54,336
And I know that you were
just doing your job.

702
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,686
But you were right.

703
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:57,905
I'm sorry, what...

704
00:33:57,948 --> 00:34:01,082
Don't let it go to your head.

705
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:04,433
I'm just as frustrated
at this whole PR charade

706
00:34:04,477 --> 00:34:06,261
as you are.

707
00:34:06,305 --> 00:34:09,525
Look...

708
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:12,441
the mayor wants the city
to take custody of the 4,400.

709
00:34:12,485 --> 00:34:13,877
Here, in Detroit. Be a part of

710
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:15,029
their reintegration
into society.

711
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,793
Okay, that seems great.

712
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:18,578
Yeah, but the Feds
have stonewalled us.

713
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:20,449
PR is all they'll let us handle.

714
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:22,060
They won't let us in
on any logistics,

715
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,757
or information gathered.

716
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,126
Yeah, but they're saying
they don't know anything.

717
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,152
Yeah, then why not let us in
on what they got?

718
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:30,372
Why not be transparent
with their local partners?

719
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:34,550
You think that
they know something.

720
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:37,205
But the question is what?

721
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:53,482
Did you know magnolias are
quite resilient?

722
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:56,572
Live in many types of climate.

723
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:59,706
They may seem as delicate
as a honeycomb,

724
00:34:59,749 --> 00:35:02,404
but they are not.

725
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:05,842
They represent long life

726
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:09,237
to those who give
and receive them.

727
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:14,416
Maybe you could
give those to Mildred

728
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,244
when she comes back.

729
00:35:20,509 --> 00:35:21,945
This is what I saw.

730
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:26,254
I-I was right, but not...

731
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:30,432
These are "get well" flowers.

732
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:33,435
And I think she'll love 'em.

733
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:36,501
But what is the purpose
of seeing the future

734
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:38,745
if I couldn't see
if she'd get hurt?

735
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:41,051
A-And if I can't see
if she's all right now?

736
00:35:41,095 --> 00:35:44,011
What if something's wrong,
and I can't help?

737
00:35:44,054 --> 00:35:46,927
I think these powers

738
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,277
aren't a solution to everything.

739
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:53,716
But I also think your
Mildred is very strong.

740
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,763
Just like those magnolias.

741
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:05,337
I was too consumed...

742
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,601
with proving that
I could help Mildred,

743
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:12,822
help everyone, that
I lost sight of her.

744
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:18,393
There was a woman in my past.

745
00:36:19,612 --> 00:36:21,091
Cynthia.

746
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:23,833
She was sick,
and I was so certain

747
00:36:23,877 --> 00:36:24,834
that I could help her.

748
00:36:24,878 --> 00:36:27,489
She-she didn't make it?

749
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:29,491
Oh, she did.

750
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:32,494
I found out that I...
I did cure her.

751
00:36:34,322 --> 00:36:37,238
But in our last moments
together,

752
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:40,589
all I cared about was the work.

753
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:42,635
I didn't listen
to what she needed.

754
00:36:42,678 --> 00:36:45,333
I-I could have been there
for her, at least...

755
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:47,857
at least for the time
that I had with her, but...

756
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:51,861
I was too consumed.

757
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:58,868
I-I'd hug you, but, um,

758
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:01,044
I don't know what triggered
that vision with Mariah,

759
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:04,570
and I don't want to invade
or see something

760
00:37:04,613 --> 00:37:06,354
that you don't want me to... Shanice.

761
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,967
I don't want to make
that mistake again.

762
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:13,796
I don't want to pull away from
the people that I care about,

763
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,190
and I...

764
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,800
I care for you.

765
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,634
I should tell you something.

766
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:28,289
I'm...

767
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,943
I'm not like the men you know.

768
00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:32,119
Yeah, I know.

769
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:33,990
I like that about you.

770
00:37:34,034 --> 00:37:35,122
No, I...

771
00:37:35,165 --> 00:37:37,080
I must tell you that

772
00:37:37,124 --> 00:37:39,518
I am not like...

773
00:37:40,997 --> 00:37:42,477
like your Logan.

774
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:46,699
You mean because he's white?

775
00:37:51,704 --> 00:37:52,879
Here.

776
00:37:54,837 --> 00:37:57,362
This might be the best way.

777
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:01,409
I want you to know me.

778
00:38:01,453 --> 00:38:03,498
It's okay to use your powers.

779
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:05,718
But I don't know how to...
Just try to focus.

780
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:08,590
I shall, as well.

781
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:22,474
When I was born,

782
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:25,346
they said I was a girl,

783
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,217
but clearly, I'm-I'm not.

784
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:30,177
I'm transgender.

785
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,093
Trans... gender?

786
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:45,323
So, are you...

787
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:48,413
Are you like Noah, then?

788
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:55,289
Yes, uh...

789
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,465
I think...

790
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:03,123
I am.

791
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:50,562
Hey. Hey.

792
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:52,955
So, how many chandeliers
did you break today?

793
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:57,525
Here.

794
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:59,701
This might help. You're amazing.

795
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:05,901
I can't believe the only
thing that went wrong today

796
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:06,925
was at the hotel.

797
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:09,731
Especially after headquarters
decided to let out

798
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:11,452
our two biggest troublemakers.

799
00:40:11,496 --> 00:40:13,280
Oh, you mean Shanice
and Claudette.Mm-hmm.

800
00:40:13,323 --> 00:40:14,412
Why did they do that?

801
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:21,462
Probably hoping that
something would go wrong

802
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:23,812
so the public could see
that the 4,400 are

803
00:40:23,856 --> 00:40:25,901
the problem, not the government.

804
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:31,994
But everything went great
with Project Reintegration,

805
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:33,909
so there goes that narrative.

806
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,870
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

807
00:40:37,913 --> 00:40:40,786
I just...

808
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:42,396
No, it's fine.

809
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,226
Well, how about we don't
talk about work anymore?

810
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,664
And take advantage... Oh...

811
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,927
of this office of yours again.

812
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,409
Did you lock the door? Always.

813
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:16,256
Gustavo?

814
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:19,868
Did the green light
get you, too?
