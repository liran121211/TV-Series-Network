1
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:11,141
Lord, I always put
my trust in you.

2
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:13,796
I made a big leap of faith,

3
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,841
and I thought it was
the right thing.

4
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:19,541
But I find myself 30 years
in the future and...

5
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:22,805
I've experienced
the impossible.

6
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:29,638
Why are the taking
the BestTime snacks?

7
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,640
They took the piano, too.

8
00:00:31,683 --> 00:00:33,468
They're punishing us.

9
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:35,165
For Shanice escaping.

10
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:37,950
We've got
to get out of here.

11
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:39,822
I asked you for a sign.

12
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:41,737
This must be the sign,

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,696
but... help me understand.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,785
What am I to do?

15
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:50,572
Hey.

16
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:52,791
They need to talk to you.

17
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:54,663
You want to tell us
how you escaped

18
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:56,012
from the hotel the other day?

19
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,120
Do you want to tell me
when you plan on

20
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,382
letting us out of here for good?

21
00:00:58,406 --> 00:00:59,972
Since as far as I can tell,
you have

22
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:02,192
no lawful grounds to detain us.

23
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:03,846
You took a huge risk.

24
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:06,022
Potentially exposing
your husband and daughter...

25
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,111
To what? They're my family.

26
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:10,070
Look, Shanice,
you know we're not the enemy.

27
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:12,376
Michigan Penal Code,
Article 328.

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,987
"A person who commits
unlawful imprisonment

29
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:17,251
is guilty of a felony."

30
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:19,035
Just tell us
who you were working with.

31
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,752
Are they the same ones
who leaked to the public

32
00:01:20,776 --> 00:01:22,386
that you all
are missing persons?

33
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,040
That there are 4,400 of you?

34
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,652
"Punishable...

35
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:30,133
"by not more than 15 years

36
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:33,745
or a fine of not more
than $20,000, or both."

37
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,791
So have you all figured out
how we apparently

38
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,532
travelled through time?

39
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:40,839
We don't know that's
what happened.

40
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:42,798
So how come the last thing
I remember

41
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:44,321
it was 2015...

42
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:46,454
and now it's 2021?

43
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:48,673
Maybe you were taken somewhere?

44
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:51,372
Maybe someone doesn't
want you to remember? Ew, who?

45
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:53,654
Well, that's what we want to
find out, but most importantly,

46
00:01:53,678 --> 00:01:55,637
we want to make sure
that everybody's okay now.

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,658
Okay, well, we'd be more okay
if we could get out of here.

48
00:01:57,682 --> 00:01:59,162
And if we didn't have to wear

49
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:01,338
these truly hideous
synthetic fabrics.

50
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:03,166
Like, can you do something
about this...

51
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,341
travesty?

52
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,433
I don't know anything
about how Shanice got out.

53
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:11,479
Really? Because
she was last seen

54
00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:12,915
headed to the bathroom with you.

55
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,395
Yo.

56
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:16,179
She's just a kid. And kids lie, too.

57
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:17,765
Okay, you really
think interrogating minors is

58
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:19,835
is the best way to figure...

59
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:24,903
Well, I think we were just
about done here anyway.

60
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:27,930
Hey, come on, I'll have one
of the guards take you back.

61
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:31,977
Why did you say what you
said the other night?

62
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,892
You said to tell Jharrel that...

63
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:36,112
Manny's all right, that
he's sorry for everything.

64
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,853
How do you know
Jharrel's brother?

65
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:39,159
I don't know him.

66
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:41,030
Then why were you talking
about him?

67
00:02:41,073 --> 00:02:43,554
Does it have something to do
with why you all are here?

68
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,078
No. I-I-I guess it was
just something I heard.

69
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:47,950
From who? From Jharrel?

70
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:49,691
No. Just...

71
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:52,041
people talk.

72
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:54,130
So it was what... a prank?

73
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,393
Is this whole thing
some kind of prank?

74
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:59,222
We are trying to help you all.

75
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:01,442
You need to be honest with
us, not jerk us around...

76
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:02,965
Look, I can't eat the new food.

77
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:06,098
And they took away
the BestTime Bars.

78
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,493
I love the BestTime Bars.

79
00:03:11,495 --> 00:03:13,541
I've cooperated
since we've got here.

80
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:15,586
But there has been
no movement to get us out.

81
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,067
It would help if people
weren't leaking information

82
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,460
to the press
and escaping custody.

83
00:03:19,503 --> 00:03:21,331
Those sound like your problems.

84
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,593
Not mine.

85
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:24,987
And what is your
problem, Reverend?

86
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,250
I lost something that night.

87
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:28,991
On Belle Isle.

88
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,862
And I need to get it to someone.

89
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:32,081
A woman and a child.

90
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:33,735
No one is going anywhere.

91
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,911
Certainly not back to the
scene of what happened.

92
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:38,783
And families aren't being
notified until we know more.

93
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:40,220
How about this?

94
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:42,570
You give me their names,

95
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:44,746
and I'll see if I can locate
this woman and child.

96
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:47,227
And in return...

97
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,098
you tell me everything you know

98
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:50,534
about how you got here.

99
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:52,580
And Belle Isle?

100
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:56,192
We'll see.

101
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,586
First, Shanice Murray.

102
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,501
She escaped.

103
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:02,503
I think she knows more
than she's letting on.

104
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:04,896
Well...

105
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,377
everyone has secrets.

106
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:11,033
Sure you can't stay any longer?

107
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:12,600
I'm on the swing shift later.

108
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:14,210
I'd love to.

109
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,168
But I've got to get back.

110
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:19,259
My father has me
leading the service today.

111
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,783
Guess you haven't told them yet?

112
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:23,872
I...

113
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:26,178
I'm just waiting
for the right moment.

114
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:28,050
I want to make sure
they really understand.

115
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:30,139
Understand why their precious,
perfect baby boy

116
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:31,662
would end up
with someone like me?

117
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:34,012
Darlene... it's not like that.

118
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:36,232
I'm going on 17 weeks now.

119
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,452
You said you wanted to keep it.

120
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:40,628
That you wanted us
to do this together. I do!

121
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:42,325
Because I can't afford
a baby on my own.

122
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:44,284
You're not on your own.

123
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:46,329
I'm with you.

124
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,462
I thank the Lord every day.

125
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:50,333
He brought you to me, Darlene.

126
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:53,815
But they've got their
old ways of thinking.

127
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:56,470
I've got to show them
that they're wrong.

128
00:04:58,254 --> 00:05:01,170
You trust me, right?

129
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:03,390
Yeah.

130
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:05,783
Yeah? Yeah...

131
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:10,179
Do you really think
intimidation tactics

132
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:11,809
like those interrogations
are gonna work?

133
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,139
We have to use
every tactic we can.

134
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:16,403
Keisha, they are scared.
Shanice Murray escaped.

135
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:18,250
Yes, because they're being
locked up here for no reason.

136
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:19,860
Well, I want to know
who she's working with.

137
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:21,669
Where's this
I.T. guy anyway?

138
00:05:21,712 --> 00:05:22,931
Present!

139
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:24,715
And she wasn't
working with anyone.

140
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,064
That's what I wanted
to show you.

141
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:28,110
Uh, Keisha and Jharrel, right?

142
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:29,372
Cool to meet you.

143
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,331
I'm Soraya. Texpert.

144
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:33,376
You like that?
I'm making it a thing.

145
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,726
They hired me to shore up
the security in this place,

146
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,598
which is, yeah, lacking.

147
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:39,600
But look.

148
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:41,882
Here's the footage from the
cameras where Shanice escaped.

149
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:44,431
Okay, we've seen this footage.
Seems like the doors just...

150
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:45,910
opened.

151
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:47,453
Then someone moved
the cameras remotely,

152
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:49,392
so we can't see
how she opened the door.

153
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:51,675
No. Her body language says that
she wasn't prepared for this.

154
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,570
Wasn't planning on escaping.

155
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:55,224
She took advantage
of a door opening.

156
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:57,052
Are you a body language
expert, too?

157
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:59,184
Oh, I watch a lot
of reality television.

158
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:00,751
People say it's trash, but...

159
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:02,294
I say it's a masterclass
on human nature.

160
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:03,841
So we're listening
to a specialist

161
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:05,930
that trained
in the Ex-Wivesfranchise?

162
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:09,369
Uh... technically I went
to M.I.T. and Quantico, too.

163
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:11,458
But that was a lot more boring.

164
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:13,155
What's not boring is this gig.

165
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:14,896
Had to get clearance
to take it, but...

166
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,247
I had no idea
it would be... this.

167
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,118
Yeah, and what is this?

168
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:21,574
Because I can't get
anything real out of them.

169
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:22,643
Well, it's clear they have

170
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:24,384
no idea what happened to them.

171
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:26,449
Which is consistent with
reportings of alien encounters.

172
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:28,388
Aliens? Seriously?

173
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,999
Maybe? But the
simplest explanation

174
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:34,002
is that they time travelled,
clearly against their will.

175
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:36,831
So... who did that to them?

176
00:06:36,874 --> 00:06:38,920
I'm sorry, time travel is
the simplest explanation?

177
00:06:38,963 --> 00:06:40,965
Except time travel isn't
a thing.

178
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:43,054
Mm. So what's the
logical explanation?

179
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:45,622
Well, it is illogical to think
that we have all the tools

180
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,320
or the means to explain
everything in the universe.

181
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:50,410
So...

182
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:52,300
why didn't we let Shanice Murray
have a minute to catch up

183
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:54,414
with her family after she
was cleared by medical?

184
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:55,937
That is a great question.

185
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,113
Good point...

186
00:06:58,156 --> 00:06:59,767
about the family.

187
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,769
We cleared the husband
after her visit, but...

188
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,293
maybe he can get something
out of her that I can't.

189
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:06,382
Maybe she'll tell him
what she knows.

190
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:10,691
Yo, what's her deal?

191
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:12,606
Is she single?

192
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:23,878
I'm just here to talk.

193
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,318
We, uh...

194
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:30,754
we saw on the news.

195
00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:32,887
Is that what
Shanice is a part of?

196
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,628
That 4,400 people?

197
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:36,630
So you didn't have
anything to do

198
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:37,935
with leaking it to the press?

199
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,546
Leak what?
I don't know anything.

200
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:42,157
Shanice just shows up
at my doorstep after being gone

201
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,637
16 years,

202
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,160
talking like she just left.

203
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:47,510
The government is...
trying to figure it out.

204
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:49,643
Okay, we're trying to help.

205
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:53,037
Is, uh...

206
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:55,126
is she okay?

207
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,086
She's... angry.

208
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,175
Reciting the Michigan Penal Code

209
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:02,264
nonstop.

210
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:04,396
Yeah, it sounds like Shanice.

211
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:09,010
Listen, I'll admit
that I can't get through to her.

212
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:11,578
I want to try to figure out
what's going on.

213
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:13,449
I want to help her.

214
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,320
She won't talk to me.

215
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:18,715
But maybe she'll talk to you.

216
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,717
No. No, no, no.

217
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:23,067
No, listen,
we can't be involved.

218
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:25,156
You know, I have a daughter
I have to think about.

219
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,202
And that's a big part
of the reason I'm here.

220
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:29,770
I don't think you
or your family has anything

221
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:32,424
to do with this, but it would
go a long way in easing

222
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:34,252
everyone's mind if you help.

223
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,214
Uh-uh, I'm not doing it.

224
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:41,782
I already lost a nail in here
and it's probably from cutting

225
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:44,785
your arm open over and over
again... Doc, tell her.

226
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:46,700
This does not seem wise.

227
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:48,789
I swore an oath
to first do no harm.

228
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:51,052
And that is Doc talk
for "it's cray."

229
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:53,445
Don't you want to know
the limits of this thing?

230
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,360
What exactly I can take?

231
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:57,711
Lord have mercy...
Just break my finger!

232
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:00,757
We already know I
can heal from cuts.

233
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:03,412
If I can heal from anything...

234
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:06,241
I can isolate one of them guards
and take 'em on.

235
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:09,549
And then if they beat me
or shoot me...

236
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:12,247
whatever... I can withstand it

237
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,336
and escape and figure out

238
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,120
how to get everyone out.

239
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:18,079
Well...

240
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:21,561
experimentation and observation
are the best road

241
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,214
to discovery.
Yes.

242
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:25,178
Y'all are really kind
of demented, you know that?

243
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:29,090
Never mind, Doc,
Ladonna here just...

244
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,700
just doesn't have
the stomach for it.

245
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:32,397
Now I didn't take her
for a fraidy cat...

246
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:34,486
Whoa, I'm not afraid
of anything, okay?

247
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,532
You're just-just too weak

248
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,988
to get the job done, dear...
It's fine.

249
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:39,491
Excuse me?

250
00:09:39,535 --> 00:09:41,581
Look, I once took out
a backstabbing skank

251
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:44,061
with one four-inch stiletto
to the chin, so I am not weak.

252
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:46,344
I didn't quite follow all that...
Pray tell, what is a skank?

253
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:47,587
Prove it.

254
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:51,721
Oh! Miss Ladonna!

255
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:53,114
She made me.

256
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,126
Fascinating.

257
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:06,649
It worked! Oh, my God.

258
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:12,002
Hmm? GUARD: Count! Count!

259
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:13,719
Line 'em up! GUARD 2: All right,
let's line up!

260
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:15,179
Okay, everybody, listen up!

261
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:17,529
Moving forward,
we'll be doing counts.

262
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:20,620
This group is assigned to this
checkpoint. When you hear

263
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,926
the alarm, you have
two minutes to get here.

264
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,668
You're being fitted
with GPS ankle bands.

265
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:29,324
Just in case anyone gets any
bright ideas about sneaking out.

266
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:31,282
Again.

267
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:34,329
These measures are in place for
you and everyone else's safety.

268
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:36,723
Do we understand each other?

269
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:40,988
Do you think this is funny?

270
00:10:41,031 --> 00:10:42,598
N-No.Then shut your mouth.

271
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,645
Oh, we know about you already.

272
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:47,647
Got something to say?

273
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:58,005
Why am I back here?

274
00:10:58,048 --> 00:11:00,442
Why won't you guys tell me

275
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:01,965
what's going on?

276
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:04,272
Logan?

277
00:11:04,315 --> 00:11:05,969
Hi, Shanice.

278
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:14,891
So, uh...

279
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,240
this is where you've been.

280
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:18,286
Well, just for
the last few days.

281
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:20,984
Be... fore that I was home

282
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:22,943
and then... Right, you, uh...

283
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:26,250
you somehow don't remember what
happened for the past 16 years.

284
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:29,471
Do I look
like I've aged 16 years?

285
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:34,171
You know, this place reminds me
of that hotel we stayed at.

286
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:36,434
Up north.Yeah.

287
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:38,567
When we had to have
the house fumigated.

288
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:44,747
Still can't believe you
shelled out for that trip.

289
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,618
You were
six months pregnant, Shanice.

290
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:47,968
What, I'm gonna make you sleep

291
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:50,187
on Mrs. Grover's
guest bed?

292
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:52,059
It's like sleeping
on a slab of concrete.

293
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,067
Why did you come?

294
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:03,461
You really don't know
what happened?

295
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:06,334
I only know that I didn't leave.

296
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:10,947
Yes, I thought about
leaving at one point.

297
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:13,471
It was postpartum depression.

298
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:16,779
It was bad and I had
some... dark nights.

299
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:19,303
You wrote me
a goodbye note, Shanice.

300
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,613
I mean, I-I knew
it was hard, but I...

301
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,485
You never told me.

302
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,270
I didn't know how.

303
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:31,272
How was I supposed
to tell you that?

304
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:33,840
I would've helped, I would've.

305
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,756
But you were never good
at asking for help.

306
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,719
Yeah, well, can I...?

307
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,156
Will you bring Mariah?

308
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,898
I'd like to...

309
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:50,595
I guess, meet her.

310
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,336
Get to know her.

311
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:54,991
I don't think
that's a good idea.

312
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:56,819
Not yet, at least.

313
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:01,693
I mean, you said for yourself
you don't know what's happening.

314
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,565
And the government
seems to think that

315
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,088
you're involved in... I'm not!

316
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:06,936
That is so ridiculous.
I just don't think I want

317
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,483
to expose her to
it all just yet.

318
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,921
I mean, what if you...?

319
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:18,623
What if you disappear again?

320
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:27,545
I should go.

321
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:31,027
Do you and, um...?

322
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:36,293
Do you have any other children?

323
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:41,646
No.

324
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:49,872
I'm glad you're okay
and I'm just...

325
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,790
I'm sorry.

326
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:10,066
Okay, folks!

327
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,894
Now this is what we like to see.

328
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:13,765
Everybody follows the rules.

329
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:15,724
Everything will be peachy.

330
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:17,552
Just like I said.

331
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:19,467
See you at the next one.

332
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:24,080
Hey.

333
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:26,648
I heard you talking about trying
to get us back to Belle Isle.

334
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:28,519
It's an idea
I've been pondering.

335
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:30,403
Do you think it might
reverse everything, like,

336
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:32,741
somehow take us back to before?

337
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:35,048
Maybe it's like
that new show Outlander.

338
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:37,050
This chick finds some kind
of altar in the woods,

339
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:39,095
and then all of a sudden,
she's at this castle

340
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:40,531
with this hottie in a kilt

341
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:42,185
and they go... at it.
Wow.

342
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:44,666
I'm just saying homegirl had
to go back and frolic

343
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:47,166
at the Druid Stones to time travel,
so...

344
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,933
What are you three
always off talking about?

345
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,676
You know, mostly fashion.

346
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,720
And, um...

347
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:57,374
old-timey doctor...

348
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:58,854
stuff.
I got to go.

349
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:09,125
What was that?

350
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:11,562
What was... what?

351
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:14,435
Was that a BestTime bar?

352
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:20,983
So you decided to make
this Belle Isle trip

353
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:22,269
a whole campaign?

354
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:23,661
I'm determined and somehow

355
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:25,663
I didn't think
you were gonna make it happen.

356
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:27,535
You're selling these people
a bill of goods.

357
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:29,992
You've got them thinking that if
they go there, this whole thing

358
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:32,081
will be undone and they'll just
go back to living their lives.

359
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:33,628
Do you know that to be false?

360
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:35,195
Can you explain what's happened?

361
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:36,912
You just want to go back
for whatever you left there.

362
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,154
You'll get that.

363
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:39,436
And what do they get... nothing.

364
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,983
They'll get out.

365
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,811
Even if it's for a short time.

366
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:44,180
We've been trapped
like rats in a cage.

367
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:45,466
It'll be something.

368
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:47,163
They think
this will take them back.

369
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:48,706
That whatever happened
will happen again.

370
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,530
How do you think they'll feel
when it doesn't?

371
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:51,733
How do you know it won't?

372
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:53,691
You're lying to them.

373
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:55,302
Who knows?

374
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:57,347
Maybe it will happen again
and we'll all be gone.

375
00:15:57,391 --> 00:16:01,003
But I need to make things right
with my family either way.

376
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:02,918
I have to.

377
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:07,314
And may we hold His holiness
close to our hearts!

378
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:09,838
Amen, and may we live
in the light

379
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:12,232
that shines in each
and every one of us!

380
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:14,147
Praise God in Jesus' name!

381
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,411
Somebody show Him the love
that He deserves!

382
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:19,128
Somebody show Him

383
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:21,284
the praise that He deserves!

384
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:23,112
Glory be to God!

385
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:24,984
Glory be to God.

386
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:26,724
Yes, praise Him!

387
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:27,856
Hallelujah!

388
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,466
The Lord flowed

389
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,946
through you today, son.

390
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,600
Thank you, sir.

391
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:34,689
I felt His presence.
It felt good out there.

392
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:36,473
You're a natural.

393
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:38,432
It's why your mother
and I are so pleased

394
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:39,887
you're here to help
us guide the flock.

395
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:41,130
And we've been talking.

396
00:16:41,174 --> 00:16:42,697
It's about time to give you

397
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,351
some more responsibility.

398
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:45,961
And time for you to start

399
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,441
thinking about your future.

400
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:49,138
I have been thinking
about my future.

401
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:51,140
And I've actually been
meaning to tell you.

402
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:53,316
There's a woman
I've been seeing.

403
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,709
A woman?

404
00:16:54,752 --> 00:16:56,276
Who's her family?

405
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,104
She's not...

406
00:16:58,147 --> 00:17:00,236
she's not a part of the faith.

407
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,977
But I love her
and I think if you just...

408
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,022
Son...

409
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,893
you're young.

410
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:07,287
And you want to sow
some wild oats.

411
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,071
And that's all right.

412
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:10,657
The Lord understands
your need for comfort.

413
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:12,074
But...

414
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:14,555
all this will be yours someday.

415
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,992
You're gonna need
to find someone

416
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,429
who can share
this burden with you,

417
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,388
who understands your needs

418
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:22,824
and the life you must lead.

419
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:25,957
But I don't need
all of this to serve the Lord.

420
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:27,568
These people, they're pouring

421
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:28,960
out their money.

422
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:30,614
That ring on your finger

423
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:34,053
is worth more than most
of them make in a year.

424
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,750
It doesn't feel right.

425
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:38,622
It's not only right.

426
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,321
It's ordained.

427
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:44,933
This ring reminds me
of who I am.

428
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:47,109
This is how we praise Him.

429
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:49,546
This is all

430
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,374
in Jesus' name.

431
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:55,857
Yes, sir.
All right.

432
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,989
Amen.Amen.

433
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:04,518
Hey, sweetheart.

434
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:06,998
I thought you were, uh...

435
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:09,131
going over to Naima's to study?

436
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:11,351
Dad, why did you go see her
without telling me?

437
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:14,528
How did you...?

438
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:18,638
I knew I shouldn't have let you
download that door camera app.

439
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:20,502
Please, you can't even
figure out how it works.

440
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:21,883
You can't go eavesdropping

441
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:23,667
on people's conversations
like that, okay?

442
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:26,081
Some kids at school were talking
about the Belle Isle people.

443
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,195
Saying it might be some
foreign invasion

444
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:31,893
or something,
but she's one of them so...

445
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:33,677
We don't know anything
about her situation.

446
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:36,332
I thought you'd talk to me
about it.

447
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:37,812
You usually, like,

448
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:39,944
talk to me about stuff.

449
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:42,556
I know.

450
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,645
I'm know, I'm sorry, but...

451
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:46,560
look, this is...

452
00:18:46,603 --> 00:18:48,277
you know, it's complicated,
and I just don't want it

453
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:49,563
to interfere with your life.

454
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:51,217
But I want to see her, too.

455
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:54,568
I mean, I've never...

456
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:57,005
I only have pictures of her.

457
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:58,833
You know?

458
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:00,356
And I want to know
what happened.

459
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,315
She doesn't even know.

460
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:04,186
And until we have
more information,

461
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,188
it's just not safe to see her.

462
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:08,886
But, Dad... Mariah... I mean it.

463
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:12,455
This conversation is
closed for now.

464
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:20,376
So I found this room
when I was poking around.

465
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,639
Before, the snacks were
just out, but I guess

466
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:23,858
they locked 'em up.

467
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:25,120
So let's just go, okay?

468
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,382
That guard takes

469
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:27,866
a long break,
but he'll be back soon.

470
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:30,908
What's going on?

471
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:33,433
I don't
even really totally

472
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:34,608
know that I can do it.

473
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:36,175
Yes, you do.

474
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,307
Seriously, what's going on?

475
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:48,274
Oh, my...
Wait a minute.

476
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,014
Wait a minute.

477
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:52,016
Did you...?
Did you just...?

478
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,844
Wait, can you...?

479
00:19:54,802 --> 00:19:56,107
What?!

480
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,155
Hayden.

481
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,640
So, like, we're all clear

482
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:08,468
that you just did that
with your mind, right?

483
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:10,861
Are you, like, a superhero
or something?

484
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:12,863
I don't know.

485
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:15,649
I've only been able to do it
since... you know.

486
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:17,999
Can I do that?

487
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,630
I don't, I don't
think I can do that.

488
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:22,569
Yeah, me, neither.

489
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:24,788
Dude. Aren't these sick?

490
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:42,284
Mmm, yummy, snacks. BestTime Bars are

491
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:44,068
I'm starving. So much fun...

492
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:48,343
Hey, wait a minute, you guys
are not supposed to be in here.

493
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:49,813
You're gonna be
in so much trouble!

494
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:51,859
You better put that stuff back
right now!

495
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:53,817
How did you even get in here? Keep singing!

496
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,428
What? Just do it!

497
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:56,690
Okay, uh, Best...

498
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:05,481
I love chips.

499
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:09,659
I think as long
as you sing about snacks,

500
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:12,358
the guard... wants snacks?
BestTime Bars are number one.

501
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:15,622
It doesn't seem
to affect us, though.

502
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:17,232
Just him.

503
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,234
That is tubular. Make it a BestTime Bar.

504
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:34,728
Mrs. Murray?

505
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:36,164
Well...

506
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:39,123
you have that wide-eyed air
about you.

507
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:41,038
New to the sleepless club?

508
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:42,910
Yeah, I guess I am.

509
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:45,521
I always slept like the dead.

510
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:48,045
But here...

511
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:50,787
after everything...

512
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:53,616
Yes, one's troubles
can have a way

513
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,532
of invading one's mind
and chasing off rest

514
00:21:56,576 --> 00:21:58,099
in even the most weary.

515
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:05,541
My husband came to see me today.

516
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:07,935
And when I first

517
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:10,198
saw him,
I thought it was a good thing.

518
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:12,983
An amazing thing.

519
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:15,159
You know, like maybe
we could fix this?

520
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,730
But the gulf between us now
feels so wide.

521
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:27,824
I don't know that
I'll ever get my family back.

522
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:29,913
It will take time.

523
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:32,655
A strange

524
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:34,701
and fickle beast, apparently.

525
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:39,662
You must have people
that you miss,

526
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:41,490
that you want to connect with?

527
00:22:41,534 --> 00:22:43,405
It's 2021.

528
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:45,320
Everyone is dead.

529
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:53,894
The reverend wants
to go back to Belle Isle.

530
00:22:53,937 --> 00:22:55,417
Thinks it might

531
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:58,377
help us figure something out.

532
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,554
It certainly seems
a worthy experiment.

533
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:03,599
What do you think
would occur there?

534
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:05,688
I don't know.

535
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:08,517
It seems crazy to think...

536
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,520
But the crazy thing happened.

537
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:13,957
And maybe if we go back
to Belle Isle,

538
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,568
it'll all...

539
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:17,613
reverse itself.

540
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:19,615
Maybe we can all get everything

541
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:22,139
and everyone... back.

542
00:23:22,183 --> 00:23:24,881
And maybe I can...

543
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:26,753
get my family back.

544
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:33,890
Six...

545
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:35,979
382, four... KEN: Seven...

546
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:38,068
79... Watch it!

547
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:39,418
Nine...

548
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,681
Ten, 11...

549
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:43,900
12, 13...

550
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:46,294
14, 15,

551
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:49,210
16, 17, 18...

552
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:08,683
I don't know
why I ever believed you.

553
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,536
You're never gonna
go against them.

554
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:12,102
You're never gonna
leave this place

555
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:13,495
because you like it too much.

556
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:14,951
Of course I like it...
I'm a man of God.

557
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:16,455
He's everything to me.

558
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:18,674
No, it's not that.

559
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:20,241
It's your family.

560
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:22,461
It's the money and the power.

561
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:24,637
It's how you can
manipulate people.

562
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,876
How you can make them believe
you, do whatever you want.

563
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,510
That's not true.

564
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:30,730
What we have is real.

565
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,341
I'm gonna make it right.

566
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:34,995
I will!

567
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:36,997
They'll listen to reason.

568
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,087
They'll see our love
and they'll understand.

569
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:43,090
No, they won't.

570
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:46,093
You're gonna have
to make a choice.

571
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,618
And I don't think
you're gonna choose me.

572
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:51,272
Or our child.

573
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:54,318
You're gonna turn out
just like him.

574
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,547
Okay, that's enough.

575
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,516
That was uncalled for!

576
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,213
Why in the world would you
attack him?!

577
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:20,562
He didn't do anything!

578
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:22,433
I started it! Kid's a troublemaker.

579
00:25:22,477 --> 00:25:24,000
Don't like his attitude.

580
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:25,978
Let me examine him
and make sure nothing is broken.

581
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:29,005
Everybody needs to understand
that order will be maintained!

582
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:31,791
You don't make the rules here!

583
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:35,011
We do.

584
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:41,104
He's fine. Stay where you are.
Come on.

585
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:53,943
You all right?

586
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:55,423
Sure.

587
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:57,923
Just trying to recover
from getting attacked

588
00:25:57,947 --> 00:25:59,688
by that power-tripping guard.

589
00:25:59,732 --> 00:26:02,430
I was finally starting to feel
a little better, like maybe

590
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:04,582
there's a reason for all of
this, especially after I learned

591
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:06,129
I could just sing and...

592
00:26:06,173 --> 00:26:08,305
You-you could what?
You could sing and...

593
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:10,264
Never mind.

594
00:26:10,307 --> 00:26:11,744
But what about going
to Belle Isle?

595
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:14,137
Maybe the green lights
will come and take us back?

596
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:15,767
Maybe we can finally
get out of here for good?

597
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:18,098
Listen, I know I said that
we should go there,

598
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:21,014
but I'm not sure it would
actually work that way.

599
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:24,452
Okay.

600
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:25,845
I just...

601
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,475
I thought you knew
how to make things better.

602
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:30,763
It just feels like nobody cares.

603
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:32,939
Like, nobody's trying
to help us.

604
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:35,115
Going back to Belle Isle
just felt like...

605
00:26:35,158 --> 00:26:36,943
I don't know.

606
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:38,509
Hope?

607
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:41,861
She's not the wife you

608
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:43,950
would've chosen,
but she's my choice.

609
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:45,691
Don't you think you're going

610
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:47,736
to bring that woman
into this place.

611
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,782
She's the woman I love.

612
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:52,088
And what about your
responsibilities here?

613
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:55,004
What about your responsibility
to our people?

614
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:56,702
You call it responsibility, but

615
00:26:56,745 --> 00:26:58,486
who really benefits?

616
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:00,836
Darlene's right.

617
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,796
What we do here is hypocrisy.

618
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,408
We built this house
on God's Word.

619
00:27:07,451 --> 00:27:10,150
We built this congregation
at His command.

620
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:11,499
Maybe.

621
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:14,197
But now we use it for us.

622
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:17,418
If that's what you see,
then you are lost in your faith.

623
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:20,595
Every day we preach the Word
to those people out there,

624
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,553
because they are tired,

625
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:24,904
they are sad, anxious,

626
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:26,732
in pain,
because the world is hard.

627
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:28,690
I know that... You don't know!

628
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:30,363
You don't know
or you wouldn't be standing here

629
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:32,128
giving me this nonsense.

630
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:34,174
The Lord asked us, this family,

631
00:27:34,217 --> 00:27:35,523
to sacrifice.

632
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:37,830
To dedicate our lives to others.

633
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:41,181
They need to see that the
Lord put us here for them.

634
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:43,400
They need to see
that we can bear their burdens

635
00:27:43,444 --> 00:27:45,664
and that there are
rewards beyond the material.

636
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,535
Because what people need...

637
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:49,711
What the Lord knows they need...

638
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:51,234
Is hope.

639
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:55,717
And if you don't know
that that's worth more

640
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:58,154
than dollars and cents...

641
00:28:00,156 --> 00:28:02,419
then you really
don't understand, son.

642
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,204
Who do you think you are?

643
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:06,641
That you can reject God's plan?

644
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:27,227
It was stupid.

645
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,968
It's not stupid.

646
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:31,579
It's what everyone needs.
I see that now.

647
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:33,755
It's my calling.

648
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,801
I haven't been listening.

649
00:28:35,844 --> 00:28:39,195
Listening to who? You
have my promise, Noah.

650
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:40,806
I'm going to make things right.

651
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:43,591
But first I need to know
everything that's going on.

652
00:28:43,634 --> 00:28:45,569
I feel like there's things
that I don't know about.

653
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:47,029
Like with the singing.

654
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:50,815
Will you share with me?

655
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:00,303
Hey there.

656
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:02,305
I heard there was an incident

657
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:04,133
with one of the guards?

658
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:07,833
Wanted to check on you.

659
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:09,486
And...

660
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,097
uh, bring you some food.

661
00:29:12,098 --> 00:29:13,708
Made it myself.

662
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,319
Since...

663
00:29:16,363 --> 00:29:17,930
uh, you said
you didn't like the food.

664
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:19,496
What about my friend?

665
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,455
The guards are here
for your protection.

666
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:23,674
When any of you disobeys

667
00:29:23,718 --> 00:29:24,937
the rules, it...

668
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,765
makes things unsafe
for everyone.

669
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,941
We're not safe now.

670
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:30,420
How can we be when
we're not free?!

671
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:42,432
Hey.
Yo.

672
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:44,434
So...

673
00:29:44,478 --> 00:29:45,847
why did you want me
to meet you here?

674
00:29:45,871 --> 00:29:47,655
Wanted to talk somewhere

675
00:29:47,698 --> 00:29:49,483
without cameras tracking
our every move.

676
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:54,096
I think we should take people
back to Belle Isle.

677
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,968
Okay...

678
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:59,058
I-I've heard rumblings
among the 4,400 about this,

679
00:29:59,101 --> 00:30:01,277
but youwant to do this?

680
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:03,410
Some of these people seem
to be doing badly here.

681
00:30:03,453 --> 00:30:05,518
If we can show them that
we're trying to help them...

682
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:07,109
Mm-hmm, and who knows,

683
00:30:07,153 --> 00:30:08,652
maybe they're right,
and Belle Isle is some kind

684
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:10,460
of time machine.Funny.

685
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:12,874
I will be watching every minute,
see if we can get some clues,

686
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:15,770
some idea of... what happened
last time they were there.

687
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,380
And I am going to enjoy

688
00:30:17,424 --> 00:30:19,304
seeing these people
actually get some fresh air.

689
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:22,516
Whatever happens,
they deserve that.

690
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,171
So... you gonna sweet-talk
your girl into it?

691
00:30:26,215 --> 00:30:28,130
I will handle Agent Tanner.

692
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:30,437
She got called
to oversee an emergency

693
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,569
at the Ypsi Med facility.

694
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:34,180
Took a bunch of the guards
with her,

695
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:36,269
so the place is as unguarded
as it will ever be.

696
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:40,360
Okay, night trip to Belle Isle

697
00:30:40,403 --> 00:30:41,796
it is, but you and me

698
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,406
can't take everybody.

699
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,974
Maybe we can slip a group out
after their count.

700
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:47,889
Mm, and they're all wearing
ankle monitors,

701
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:50,239
so we'll be able find them
if anything goes wrong.

702
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:53,155
But... I have my body-worn
camera just in case.

703
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:54,896
Yes, yes,
everyone will be tracked

704
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,613
and monitored
within an inch of their life.

705
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:58,334
A police state in action. Hey.

706
00:30:59,248 --> 00:31:00,771
We stay vigilant.

707
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:02,077
Okay?

708
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:11,019
Me and my brother used to
draw these everywhere.

709
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:13,001
It was a game to play.

710
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:15,830
One of us would start out a
clock, the other one would add

711
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,745
another number and we'd...

712
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:19,616
keep adding numbers
until it was done.

713
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,444
Think he might still be here?

714
00:31:22,663 --> 00:31:25,057
I don't know, these people
arriving here, they...

715
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,537
brought back my hope
for finding him.

716
00:31:28,495 --> 00:31:30,801
So if...

717
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:33,892
somehow this whole thing
works out...

718
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:36,677
and they do go back, then...

719
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,376
I don't know, maybe I can put
this whole thing behind me.

720
00:31:41,377 --> 00:31:43,118
Finally let go of Manny, too.

721
00:31:46,252 --> 00:31:47,514
To Belle Isle.

722
00:31:55,348 --> 00:31:56,784
Hey.

723
00:31:56,827 --> 00:31:59,221
I heard you earlier.

724
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:01,136
I-I hope this helps you
feel better.

725
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,964
That you'll be out,
free for a bit.

726
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:04,183
Oh, I'm not going.

727
00:32:04,226 --> 00:32:06,446
I have to stay here.

728
00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:08,361
But why? I-I thought... Are you sure?

729
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:12,104
I just have to stay... here.

730
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:14,758
See you when we get back?

731
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:16,717
Yeah.

732
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:40,523
So...

733
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:43,352
you notice anything suspicious?

734
00:32:43,396 --> 00:32:45,964
I mean, have you figured
out the mystery yet?

735
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:49,551
Guess the time machine's
not working tonight.

736
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:07,072
That's what you wanted
to come back here for?

737
00:33:07,115 --> 00:33:09,726
Originally, yes.

738
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:13,121
Nice rock.

739
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:14,688
Worth a pretty penny.

740
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:17,082
It is. I was gonna
give it to Darlene

741
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:19,998
to show her that I had always
intended to do right by her.

742
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:22,261
I tracked her down,
her and her son.

743
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:24,524
Your son?

744
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:27,048
A son?

745
00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:28,702
I have a son?

746
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:32,706
I have to let them go.

747
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:34,099
But why...

748
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:36,057
It's not what the
Lord wanted for me.

749
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:37,841
I made the wrong choice then.

750
00:33:37,885 --> 00:33:40,192
And I think
that's why this is happening.

751
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:41,889
He is showing me

752
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:44,326
the way... that I must
accept my calling.

753
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,849
What calling?

754
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:47,503
To be here.

755
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:50,028
To be present. To believe.

756
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:53,814
Mark 9:23...
"All things are possible

757
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:55,511
to him that believeth."

758
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:58,079
If you'll excuse me, I'd...

759
00:33:58,123 --> 00:34:00,777
like to lead a prayer.

760
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:09,003
First, let's take a moment

761
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,787
to give thanks for being here.

762
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:12,920
Lord, the fresh air feels good.

763
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:16,141
It's strange being back
in this place, isn't it?

764
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:18,360
What we've gone through

765
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:21,407
is a lot for any human to bear,
and they try

766
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:24,018
and they try
to take our humanity away,

767
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,802
but they won't succeed.

768
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:39,444
We were taken away from the comfort
of our lives, And if that mocking

769
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:41,644
taken from those we love, Bird don't sing

770
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:43,516
taken from Mama's gonna

771
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,363
our realities as we knew
it! Buy you a diamond ring.

772
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:47,433
And... And if

773
00:34:47,476 --> 00:34:49,150
some of you came here
tonight That diamond ring

774
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:50,974
hoping to make that all
go away. Turns brass

775
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:53,917
I'm here to tell you Mama's gonna buy you

776
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:55,658
it won't. A looking glass.

777
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:57,530
We must accept the truth

778
00:34:57,573 --> 00:34:59,160
of our tribulations.

779
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,708
We must accept the seriousness

780
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:04,145
of our circumstance,
because the truth is,

781
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:07,670
we were brought
forward in time, yes?

782
00:35:07,714 --> 00:35:09,759
But the Lord didn't
bring us here.

783
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:11,283
To flounder alone.

784
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:13,111
He gave us each other.

785
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:16,549
And he gave us gifts.

786
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,216
Let's give praise
to Sister Mildred.

787
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:33,957
She's making this happen
with her mind.

788
00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:36,656
And Brother Noah is
using his voice

789
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:38,832
to give us the privacy
of this moment.

790
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:41,051
Just us...
without our keepers.

791
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,272
They're fine, just in slumber.

792
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:46,796
Because I needed
this moment to reach you,

793
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,235
to let you all know
that you're special.

794
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:52,889
To let you all know
that we've been taken

795
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:55,936
and brought here for a reason.

796
00:35:55,979 --> 00:35:59,069
We have been brought here
on a mission!

797
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:02,725
We don't know
exactly what it is yet.

798
00:36:02,769 --> 00:36:05,598
But I believe
that I am here to lead you.

799
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:09,123
Look within yourself.

800
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,952
See yourself
and know your worth.

801
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:15,521
Know your power
and own your gifts.

802
00:36:15,564 --> 00:36:17,305
Because who are we

803
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:19,916
to question God's plan?

804
00:36:20,874 --> 00:36:22,223
Extraordinary.

805
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:24,443
I assumed there were others,

806
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:26,096
but I never imagined

807
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,576
this.

808
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,163
I just thought finally
maybe it was my turn

809
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,493
to be the one people turn to.

810
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:32,842
But him.

811
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,585
Give him another two weeks,
and they'll be

812
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:39,022
eating out
of the palm of his hand.

813
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:40,807
And I do not trust
what he will do

814
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,852
with that kind of power.

815
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:52,645
Well... they didn't
get taken back.

816
00:36:52,688 --> 00:36:55,082
Instead we all just,
what, fell asleep?

817
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:56,475
Something put us to sleep.

818
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:58,912
Something put everybody
on Belle Isle

819
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:00,914
to sleep at the same time.

820
00:37:00,957 --> 00:37:02,437
The question is: What?

821
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:03,960
The 4,400 seemed
just as confused

822
00:37:04,004 --> 00:37:05,324
as we were
when all of us woke up.

823
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:07,007
No, we don't know
what happened to them.

824
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,617
We were asleep.

825
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:10,291
Okay, well, we know
that they all got on the bus

826
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:12,578
with us just as planned.

827
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:14,667
Everyone accounted for.
No trouble at all.

828
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,364
What, you think
they were faking it?

829
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:18,061
I think I'm gonna find out.

830
00:37:18,105 --> 00:37:19,952
Pulling up the footage
from my body cam right now.

831
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:22,196
Score one for our police state,
by the way.

832
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,416
Ah, cop's got jokes.

833
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:26,026
At least we can
actually see what...

834
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:27,462
happened.

835
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:30,596
So, I took
the ankle bracelets off-line

836
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:33,251
for a little unscheduled
reboot, like you asked.

837
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,471
But I'm dying
to know what happened.

838
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:38,057
Was it like an Outlander
kind of situation

839
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:39,605
or, like, more
like Close Encounters?

840
00:37:39,648 --> 00:37:42,651
I'm still not sure
why you're even helping us.

841
00:37:43,957 --> 00:37:46,089
I don't like this whole
operation.

842
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:47,961
From what I can tell,

843
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:49,789
these people shouldn't be
locked up.

844
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:52,139
And even if they are
aliens or clones

845
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:54,228
or run-of-the-mill
time travelers,

846
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,535
those things aren't even crimes.

847
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:01,191
So if you two are
trying to help them,

848
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:02,976
I'll help you.

849
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:05,587
Oh, come on.

850
00:38:05,631 --> 00:38:07,154
We should show her.

851
00:38:22,952 --> 00:38:24,345
Damn it, the camera broke.

852
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:25,955
Like, what happened?
Was there some kind

853
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:27,498
of sonic weapon
that put everyone to sleep?

854
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:29,568
Or is it the atmosphere
on Belle Isle?

855
00:38:29,611 --> 00:38:31,265
I don't know.

856
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,006
But I want to find out.

857
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:35,182
Let me go back to the office,
and see if I can pull

858
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:37,576
anything else from the footage.
You coming?

859
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:38,838
I can't.

860
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:40,970
Got to go lie to my girlfriend.

861
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:42,711
I'll send you the file.

862
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:44,844
Girlfriend?

863
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,344
Care for a drink?

864
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:08,041
No thanks.
I'm waiting for my lady.

865
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:09,608
That for her?

866
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:11,914
In a way.

867
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:14,526
This is the key
to our future together.

868
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:16,571
Worth a fortune.

869
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:18,660
I'll be able to give her
everything she needs,

870
00:39:18,704 --> 00:39:20,923
everything she deserves
with this.

871
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:22,751
It's the start
of our life together.

872
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:24,492
That looks heavy.

873
00:39:24,536 --> 00:39:26,383
I think something like that
might weigh me down.

874
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,235
Me, too.

875
00:39:28,278 --> 00:39:32,108
It would tempt me into becoming
someone I didn't want to be.

876
00:39:33,283 --> 00:39:35,329
And that's
why I'm never gonna wear it.

877
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,028
I'm gonna be free.

878
00:39:39,072 --> 00:39:41,248
We're gonna be free.

879
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:45,557
If she comes looking for me,

880
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,036
can you tell her
I'll be right back?

881
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,386
Sure thing.

882
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:50,083
Thank you.

883
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:12,453
Excu...? He just
went to the restroom.

884
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:13,933
But he'll be right back.

885
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:15,848
Great. I'll wait.

886
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,954
That ended up being
a rather eventful evening.

887
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:37,391
I guess I kind of got
wrapped up in the idea

888
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,871
that it was gonna be
more eventful.

889
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:40,960
That we'd return.

890
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,703
I, too, am sad for what we lost.

891
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:47,009
But what we've all gone through,

892
00:40:47,053 --> 00:40:49,751
it's truly awe-inspiring and...

893
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:54,016
I'm also grateful

894
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,105
for what I have found here.

895
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:01,415
Me, too, Doc.

896
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,809
So...

897
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:06,333
uh, I think we continue to be

898
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:07,813
in a confounding situation.

899
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:10,250
As to what that heralds
for our future,

900
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:12,165
I...

901
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:13,558
cannot say.

902
00:41:16,604 --> 00:41:18,693
Perhaps it will become
clearer in the morning.

903
00:41:18,737 --> 00:41:20,434
Perhaps.

904
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,740
Good night.

905
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:31,619
Hi, Mom.

906
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:34,883
All right, I'll be
right back, Soraya.
