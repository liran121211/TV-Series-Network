1
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:24,563
No.

2
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:27,392
I want an attorney.

3
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:29,046
Uh, you can't hold me like this.

4
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,308
Oh, DHS can.

5
00:00:30,352 --> 00:00:32,920
We got a tip
on those stolen files.

6
00:00:32,963 --> 00:00:34,680
We can place you at Ypsi Med
a couple of weeks ago.

7
00:00:34,704 --> 00:00:36,924
I don't know what files
you're talking about!

8
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:38,487
Did your brother ask you
to steal them?

9
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:41,406
Why would...

10
00:00:43,104 --> 00:00:46,324
My brother has been
missing for a year.

11
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:48,718
You know that.

12
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:49,980
Manny's not missing.

13
00:00:52,374 --> 00:00:54,115
We have him.

14
00:00:54,158 --> 00:00:56,334
Wait, what-what?

15
00:00:56,378 --> 00:00:57,901
Wait, you...

16
00:00:57,945 --> 00:00:59,207
you have my brother?

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,662
Where-where have you
been keeping him?

18
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,427
Let me see him.
Let me talk to Manny.

19
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:04,144
I'd suggest you tell us what we
want to know about his research.

20
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:05,169
Jessica.

21
00:01:05,213 --> 00:01:06,649
And your story better match his.

22
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,564
Let me talk to my brother. I'll be back

23
00:01:08,607 --> 00:01:10,367
when you're ready
to start telling the truth.

24
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:23,318
Any word on Jharrel?

25
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:24,536
Nothing.

26
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,364
I tried calling all the contacts

27
00:01:26,408 --> 00:01:28,801
I can think of, and no one
will give me a straight answer.

28
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:30,064
What can we do?

29
00:01:30,107 --> 00:01:31,326
It's been two days.

30
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:33,067
Well, the warrant is legit.

31
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,244
DHS admits to having him
in their custody, and...

32
00:01:36,287 --> 00:01:37,767
that's all I know.

33
00:01:38,855 --> 00:01:40,161
All right, I'll, uh...

34
00:01:40,204 --> 00:01:42,424
get some of this back
to the hotel.

35
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:44,948
I can't tell you how grateful
I am for all your help, Keisha.

36
00:01:44,992 --> 00:01:46,950
We all are.

37
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:50,475
The climate's growing unsavory
for the 4,400

38
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,956
and our sympathizers.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,871
Just take care
to watch your back out there.

40
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,308
You, too.

41
00:01:57,352 --> 00:01:58,962
You okay here, solo?

42
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,747
Don't worry.

43
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,012
I'll be just fine.

44
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:13,063
I'm not gonna lie, these last
two days have been hard.

45
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:16,327
Everyone has questions
I don't have answers to.

46
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:18,851
Ji-Eun and a few others took
their chances outside and...

47
00:02:18,895 --> 00:02:21,593
Even though we warned
them sanctuary status

48
00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:23,073
only protects us
inside the hotel.

49
00:02:23,117 --> 00:02:24,422
And now, now they're vulnerable

50
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:25,946
to anyone who
calls the tip line.

51
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:27,643
And they're at the
government's mercy.

52
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:32,474
Shanice, you are not responsible
for other people's choices.

53
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,130
And we're not under
the government's thumb.

54
00:02:36,173 --> 00:02:38,480
Freedom is everything.

55
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:40,308
Yeah, I just wish
I could figure it out.

56
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:42,266
Rev and I did an inventory,

57
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,616
and the government took most
of our food and supplies.

58
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,705
People are
starting to panic.Uh...

59
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:50,187
things as they are might
not feel sustainable long-term,

60
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:53,408
but you are a tremendous leader.

61
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:55,627
I have faith in you.

62
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:58,717
Even if the day-to-day
is a bit more challenging,

63
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:02,678
we can and will fend
for ourselves.

64
00:03:02,721 --> 00:03:03,809
Together.

65
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:05,550
Together.

66
00:03:08,118 --> 00:03:10,077
I must admit,

67
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,905
it is a relief to just...

68
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:14,124
just be like this.

69
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:16,083
Without having to worry

70
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:18,389
about someone else's
memories suddenly hitting me

71
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:20,696
if I touch them.

72
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:26,789
Hey, Shanice.

73
00:03:27,877 --> 00:03:29,096
No, wait... Mariah?

74
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,794
Wait, c-can you see me?

75
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,317
Yes. I mean, no.

76
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:34,468
Uh... Um, how-how do I turn this off?

77
00:03:34,492 --> 00:03:36,712
This is clearly a bad time.

78
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:37,863
You called from earlier,
so I d...

79
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:39,280
I just thought I would...

80
00:03:39,323 --> 00:03:40,281
You know what,
I'll call you back later.

81
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:41,456
Okay. Yeah.

82
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:43,197
Bye.

83
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:48,463
Do you think she saw us?

84
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:53,685
Most certainly she did.

85
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:10,398
Who's there?

86
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:17,622
Come on out now.

87
00:04:19,276 --> 00:04:20,495
Don't be shy.

88
00:04:29,547 --> 00:04:30,635
You scared me.

89
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:32,159
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:37,642
Come on, sweetheart.

91
00:04:37,686 --> 00:04:39,296
Storm's brewing, and...

92
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,864
you're the most wanted woman
in the country right now.

93
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:45,998
Come on. It's time for both of
us to get on up out of here.

94
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:11,328
Look, just let me
see my brother.

95
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:13,156
See, that's not how this works.

96
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,506
You have to tell us what
you know about Manny's research

97
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,942
before we tell you anything.

98
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:18,118
Just tell me that he's safe.

99
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:19,815
He's being well taken care of.

100
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:21,773
We're treating him
the same as you.

101
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:23,166
If not better.

102
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,167
Of course,

103
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:25,734
he rejected the steak.

104
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:28,476
Said he's a vegetarian.

105
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,829
You look awful.

106
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:46,929
What up, though, little bro?

107
00:05:49,018 --> 00:05:50,802
Oh, sure. Come on in.

108
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:52,737
Like we haven't been pretending
we don't exist to each other

109
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:53,849
for a hot minute.

110
00:05:53,892 --> 00:05:55,677
What do you want, Jha?

111
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:59,811
You look awful. You okay?

112
00:05:59,855 --> 00:06:01,398
It's just spring allergies.
I've always had 'em.

113
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:03,206
It's not a big deal.

114
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,035
Now, what do you want?

115
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:10,344
Some stuff you need to sign.

116
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:12,520
Finalize Dad's property probate.

117
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:15,481
Since you didn't bother
showing up to the funeral.

118
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,004
Is that why?

119
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:22,094
Oh, well, you would think
that's why I didn't go.

120
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:23,270
Once a juvenile delinquent,

121
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:24,713
always a juvenile delinquent,
right?

122
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:26,316
Hey.

123
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,579
Hey, okay, okay. Take it easy.

124
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:30,928
Hey.

125
00:06:32,757 --> 00:06:35,804
Bro, you are burning up.

126
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:38,589
Hey, you're really sick.

127
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:41,766
How are you gonna take
care of yourself?

128
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,333
Food? Medicine?

129
00:06:47,468 --> 00:06:49,600
Let me...

130
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:51,298
let me stay here and help you.

131
00:06:54,301 --> 00:06:56,303
Until you feel better.

132
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:01,699
You should eat.

133
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:02,787
No. No.

134
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:04,702
Don't, don't leave.

135
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:07,009
Look, just tell me
why you have him.

136
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,532
No.

137
00:07:08,576 --> 00:07:11,143
Wait. No. Tell me
about my brother!

138
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:19,674
You've been mighty quiet.

139
00:07:19,717 --> 00:07:22,285
Want me to fix you
a little something?

140
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:24,287
I don't think I'm old enough.

141
00:07:24,331 --> 00:07:25,810
Oh, right.

142
00:07:25,854 --> 00:07:28,073
I keep forgetting
they raised the drinking age.

143
00:07:28,117 --> 00:07:31,251
Didn't you say you were
just at bartending school?

144
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:37,866
Oh, that belonged
to Jharrel's brother.

145
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,567
So, you want to talk about why
you threw that man out a window?

146
00:07:44,568 --> 00:07:47,702
I just wanted to help everyone
else who was locked up with me.

147
00:07:47,745 --> 00:07:50,966
But you didn't have a plan,
did you?

148
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,187
And I imagine,

149
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:57,494
with the government
and the whole world looking out

150
00:07:57,538 --> 00:07:59,670
for your now
very recognizable face...

151
00:08:01,324 --> 00:08:03,326
you've probably been scared
half to death.

152
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,980
I...

153
00:08:05,023 --> 00:08:06,677
I don't know
where to go anymore.

154
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:08,462
What about the sanctuary?

155
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:10,594
Doesn't everyone hate me there?

156
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:13,075
I know they're scared of me.

157
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,033
Even if I can't...

158
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,948
you know, anymore.

159
00:08:16,992 --> 00:08:18,559
What do you mean?

160
00:08:18,602 --> 00:08:20,212
My powers are gone.

161
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:24,347
Rev took them away somehow when
I was in Bill Greene's office.

162
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:26,784
He-he took it away? I mean, I guess
it stopped me

163
00:08:26,828 --> 00:08:28,545
from doing something
I'd probably really regret.

164
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:30,310
But, for once,

165
00:08:30,353 --> 00:08:33,008
I felt like I was unstoppable.

166
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:35,750
And it just felt like

167
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:37,534
I had something
for the first time.

168
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:38,622
Hey, hey, hey.

169
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,495
Pick your head up.

170
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:43,671
There is power in that.

171
00:08:43,714 --> 00:08:44,759
Right?

172
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,152
I have an idea.

173
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,807
Go on and get yourself
cleaned up

174
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:51,243
while I pop out for a sec.

175
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:52,549
Okay?

176
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:05,780
Hey.

177
00:09:05,823 --> 00:09:08,260
Uh... you called with video.

178
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:09,871
There's no need
to hold it to your ear.

179
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,658
Mariah, about earlier...

180
00:09:14,702 --> 00:09:16,704
I totally called it.

181
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:19,750
Mm, I'm not sure I...

182
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:21,448
I mean, I...

183
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:25,060
I know you and I
are still figuring out

184
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:27,279
who we are to each other, and...

185
00:09:27,323 --> 00:09:29,064
your dad said
we could have a relationship.

186
00:09:29,107 --> 00:09:30,282
But I'm...

187
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:32,328
I'm not ready to...

188
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,548
That's not what I wanted
to talk to you about.

189
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:37,377
So, things are not great here.

190
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,857
Someone mentioned crowdfunding?

191
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:42,164
I can help you set up
a FOMOFundMe page.

192
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,906
But the 4,400 is gonna need
a serious brand reboot

193
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:46,777
if you want to get the public
on board, so...

194
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:48,910
Sure.

195
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:51,129
Brand... reboot.

196
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,696
Okay.

197
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,580
Yeah, don't worry.
I mean, this-this'll be fun.

198
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:00,617
I am done playing games.

199
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:02,445
What were you
and your brother planning?!

200
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:03,881
What did he want you
to do for him?

201
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:06,144
Look, I'm not talking to
you without an attorney,

202
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,252
so you can stop asking me...

203
00:10:07,276 --> 00:10:08,451
What was he working on?!

204
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:13,717
Ask him.

205
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:15,458
I mean, you do have him.

206
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:16,677
Don't you?

207
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:19,680
You know your brother's tattoos.

208
00:10:19,723 --> 00:10:21,595
Don't you?

209
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:23,161
I'm trying to help you.

210
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,816
But if you don't give me
the information that I need,

211
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,644
I won't be able
to protect your brother.

212
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:44,879
What up, though?

213
00:10:44,922 --> 00:10:46,750
Cops used tear gas

214
00:10:46,794 --> 00:10:48,143
and pepper spray on folks

215
00:10:48,186 --> 00:10:50,058
for peacefully protesting
Operation Legend.

216
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:51,799
That's what's up.
40 got arrested,

217
00:10:51,842 --> 00:10:53,061
and I can't...

218
00:10:53,104 --> 00:10:54,236
Whoa, whoa, hey.

219
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,890
You should still be resting up.

220
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:58,283
You really don't need
to be taking care of me anymore.

221
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:01,199
Don't Carla want you back home?

222
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,072
Carla is quarantining
with her own folks.

223
00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:05,900
And she's worried
about you, too.

224
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:07,858
So take it easy on yourself.

225
00:11:07,902 --> 00:11:09,773
For her sake,
even if you won't for me.

226
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:12,341
Hey, just because I can't smell
doesn't mean I want to stink.

227
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:14,169
It's hot up in here.

228
00:11:14,212 --> 00:11:15,866
Plus, my brain isn't broken.

229
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,564
I can still fix things.

230
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:29,445
Covered up your old tat?

231
00:11:31,186 --> 00:11:32,380
Thought having
our dad's last name inked

232
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:34,058
was something meaningful to you.

233
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:37,366
Was. I don't want any link
to him on my body anymore.

234
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:38,802
Right,

235
00:11:38,846 --> 00:11:41,196
because you still blame Dad
for all your issues.

236
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:42,545
You know that man... That man

237
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:44,765
was a ghost to me
long before he died.

238
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:46,375
You know, I got that tat hoping

239
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:47,768
that it'd make him
proud for once,

240
00:11:47,811 --> 00:11:49,465
seeing as how he told me

241
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:52,076
on the regular that I'd
never amount to anything.

242
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,644
No, but of course you knew that.

243
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:55,993
You bought into it.

244
00:11:56,037 --> 00:11:58,343
Come on, you were angry.

245
00:11:58,387 --> 00:11:59,910
All the time.

246
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:01,540
All right, if you weren't
getting busted for stealing,

247
00:12:01,564 --> 00:12:02,565
it was for tagging.

248
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:03,871
Now you went and did whatever

249
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:05,525
got you that ankle monitor. What I did

250
00:12:05,568 --> 00:12:07,178
was take a private sector job.

251
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:09,746
The Feds who had been
begging me to work for them

252
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,575
retaliated by claiming
that I stole from them,

253
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:15,230
fabricated charges to try
to force me to work for them.

254
00:12:15,273 --> 00:12:18,189
This is their version
of a noncompete clause,

255
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:19,930
so I can't work
for anybody else.

256
00:12:25,022 --> 00:12:26,763
So, what did, um...

257
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:28,635
you know, what'd they
want you to work on?

258
00:12:30,158 --> 00:12:31,725
I mean...

259
00:12:31,768 --> 00:12:33,814
what is it that you actually do?

260
00:12:35,163 --> 00:12:37,295
It's hard to explain.

261
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,645
Seems like a hassle.

262
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:40,908
Why'd you turn 'em down?

263
00:12:40,951 --> 00:12:42,779
I don't cave to bullies.

264
00:12:42,823 --> 00:12:44,476
Not Dad.

265
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,000
Not the government.

266
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:47,784
I do what I think is right.

267
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,659
But I can't change
the way you see me, can I?

268
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:04,975
I'm sorry to just text you
out of the blue like that. I...

269
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:06,673
No, it's fine.

270
00:13:06,716 --> 00:13:07,891
Glad you did.

271
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,809
I'm worried.

272
00:13:12,853 --> 00:13:14,245
You haven't heard from him?

273
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:15,986
Nothing.

274
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,988
I'm sorry. I...

275
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:19,250
wish I could help.

276
00:13:20,338 --> 00:13:21,862
Actually, I think you can.

277
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:27,084
What's the deal?

278
00:13:27,128 --> 00:13:28,608
Well, Jharrel thought this

279
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:30,087
might be the key
to the clock code

280
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:31,349
you said we should look for.

281
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,003
It was in Manny's apartment.

282
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:34,111
But I don't know
what I'm looking for.

283
00:13:34,135 --> 00:13:35,658
Can you...

284
00:13:35,702 --> 00:13:37,268
break the code?

285
00:13:37,312 --> 00:13:39,183
Figure out what Manny's
message to Jharrel was?

286
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:41,098
I mean,

287
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:43,840
who better to ask
for code-breaking help

288
00:13:43,884 --> 00:13:46,321
than the world's
greatest texpert?

289
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:49,019
Texpert is on it.

290
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:50,630
Thanks.

291
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:53,371
I...

292
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,504
got to get this over
to the hotel.

293
00:13:57,027 --> 00:13:59,116
I hope they're doing okay
in there.

294
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:03,662
It's so kind of you
to be bringing all of this in.

295
00:14:03,686 --> 00:14:06,863
Having some hot food will
brighten everyone's spirits.

296
00:14:06,907 --> 00:14:08,604
Of course.

297
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:13,391
A lot of people actually seem
to want to help the 4,400.

298
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,915
But, uh...

299
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,221
Hopefully all the others
will leave us in peace.

300
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:18,875
We're not hurting anyone.

301
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,486
No, it's not about the
reality of who you all are.

302
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:25,055
Some narrative that exists
out there of prejudice

303
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:26,448
against "your kind."

304
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,539
What in the...

305
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:32,889
No, come on.

306
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:33,934
Come on.

307
00:14:33,977 --> 00:14:35,152
Come on.

308
00:14:36,763 --> 00:14:38,025
There's no power.

309
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,550
I think we're stuck.

310
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,741
Everyone else out there
has power.

311
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:00,612
This isn't the storm.

312
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:02,484
It's the government.

313
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,007
They killed the lights.

314
00:15:05,182 --> 00:15:09,926
Everyone, head back up
to your rooms in pairs.

315
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,536
Let's ride out the storm.

316
00:15:14,452 --> 00:15:16,759
Rev and I are-are responsible

317
00:15:16,803 --> 00:15:18,326
for making this
sanctuary happen.

318
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:20,110
And everyone is looking
to me for answers.

319
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:21,459
And now I have to figure out

320
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,741
how we're gonna pay
for utilities?

321
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:25,507
We focus on getting
through the night.

322
00:15:28,423 --> 00:15:31,165
I will gather supplies
from my office.

323
00:15:40,652 --> 00:15:44,091
No one's ever given me
a makeover before.

324
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:46,746
Imagine you never been wanted
by the FBI before either.

325
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:49,661
Let's get started, shall we?

326
00:15:49,705 --> 00:15:51,489
Hot mama.

327
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,622
Now, I am no professional.

328
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:57,321
So I can give you
a bob or a bob.

329
00:15:57,365 --> 00:15:58,801
Just got to...

330
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:01,586
untangle this
bird's nest first...

331
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,066
No!

332
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:06,243
Don't touch me!

333
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:14,643
I'm just trying to
help you blend in.

334
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:16,601
You want to stop running,

335
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:18,168
this is what it takes.

336
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:19,866
You don't know what it takes.

337
00:16:21,084 --> 00:16:22,303
All right, then.

338
00:16:23,652 --> 00:16:26,133
Talk to me about it.

339
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:27,699
You're allowed your anger.

340
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:28,744
That's all right.

341
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:32,704
Is it because of
the Bill Greene thing?

342
00:16:32,748 --> 00:16:34,358
And your time at Ypsi Med?

343
00:16:34,402 --> 00:16:37,361
I... hate them.

344
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,191
They tried to take advantage
of my powers,

345
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:43,193
advantage of me.

346
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:46,893
I hate everything that happened
after the green light!

347
00:16:46,936 --> 00:16:49,199
And... and everything before.

348
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:50,548
Just...

349
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,463
You might think
I don't understand

350
00:16:52,507 --> 00:16:54,947
the pain of your past catching
up with your present, but I do.

351
00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:00,995
I think it's time I showed
you something, Mildred.

352
00:17:05,128 --> 00:17:06,477
They got what was
coming to them.

353
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:08,740
The Bois Blanc is
now without power.

354
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:11,134
Have you cracked
the book's cipher?

355
00:17:11,178 --> 00:17:13,223
Hey!

356
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:16,009
Calling your bluff!

357
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:17,924
You don't have Manny.

358
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:21,666
Nah, you keep asking me about
him, what he's working on.

359
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,886
'Cause you don't
even know where he is!

360
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,802
You're trying to find him,
aren't you?

361
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:29,544
Where the hell is Manny?

362
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:31,241
All we know is
that an agent swears

363
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:33,069
she ID'd him in
Detroit last week,

364
00:17:33,113 --> 00:17:35,394
and DARPA's been wanting to
find him since he disappeared.

365
00:17:36,246 --> 00:17:38,031
Let me talk to him.

366
00:17:38,074 --> 00:17:39,162
Hey!

367
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:40,772
Still waiting on that attorney!

368
00:17:42,731 --> 00:17:46,126
I think I might know
how to break him for you.

369
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,780
Damn it, no...

370
00:17:48,824 --> 00:17:50,782
no service.

371
00:17:50,826 --> 00:17:52,828
Hey, but maybe I
can, uh, climb up,

372
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:53,936
see if there's an escape hatch.

373
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,265
If you hold the cart...

374
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:56,353
Hey.

375
00:17:57,398 --> 00:17:58,834
Hey, you okay? I don't...

376
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,792
don't like small spaces, is all.

377
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:03,708
What if... what if
they don't find us?

378
00:18:03,752 --> 00:18:05,797
Feels... Hey. Hey, whoa.

379
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:07,950
Feels like I can't breathe.Whoa. It's okay,
it's okay.

380
00:18:07,974 --> 00:18:09,821
Look, take this off. We
won't be in here for too long.

381
00:18:09,845 --> 00:18:11,151
All right?

382
00:18:11,194 --> 00:18:12,848
Put your head down
and close your eyes.

383
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,285
Can you do that for me?

384
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,113
All right, we gonna breathe in.

385
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:20,073
Hold it.

386
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:21,291
Breathe out.

387
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,773
Good. Good, good. Okay.

388
00:18:24,816 --> 00:18:26,775
One more time. Breathe in.

389
00:18:30,431 --> 00:18:32,737
Out.

390
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:40,920
Thank you. I...

391
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,619
I'm sorry. I've...
never been able to handle...

392
00:18:44,662 --> 00:18:46,490
No, it's all right.

393
00:18:46,534 --> 00:18:49,102
I've had my share
of panic attacks.

394
00:18:49,145 --> 00:18:51,931
Was hit with 'em for years
after my sister died.

395
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:55,673
Only good thing
that came from my ex

396
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,632
is she taught me how to...

397
00:18:57,675 --> 00:19:00,200
breathe through the
panic until it was over.

398
00:19:01,157 --> 00:19:02,637
She?

399
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,509
Yeah.

400
00:19:05,553 --> 00:19:06,641
She.

401
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:11,167
So... you're...

402
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:12,821
you're gay.

403
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:02,044
Dude, chill! It's me, Logan.

404
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:04,655
You want to put down
the deadly weapon? Geez.

405
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:08,094
Sorry, I-I didn't mean
to give you a scare.

406
00:20:08,137 --> 00:20:10,028
I would've come through the
front, but there's a crazy crowd

407
00:20:10,052 --> 00:20:12,228
out there. Our detractors are quite
the impediment.

408
00:20:12,272 --> 00:20:13,273
But, uh,

409
00:20:13,316 --> 00:20:14,709
why have you come?

410
00:20:14,752 --> 00:20:17,364
I heard about the outage
from Mariah.

411
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:19,496
Figured I'd bring some supplies.

412
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,846
I got tons of camping gear.

413
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,110
And this piece

414
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:25,372
of machinery?

415
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:26,851
Oh, the generator?

416
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:28,201
Won't power the whole hotel,

417
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:30,203
but I figured
it'd come in handy.

418
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:33,641
You know, hold over the kitchen,
the refrigerator a few days.

419
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:35,817
Indeed.

420
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,385
How thoughtful, Logan.

421
00:20:38,428 --> 00:20:42,041
But I must continue
to sort through these.

422
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,349
Y-You know, we've, uh,
we've come a long way

423
00:20:46,393 --> 00:20:48,482
since candles.

424
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:55,271
One thing I'd learned
in the war...

425
00:20:55,315 --> 00:20:58,796
Hard times have a way
of lingering.

426
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,451
So, while these items

427
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:03,584
aren't as excitingly modern,

428
00:21:03,627 --> 00:21:06,717
they'll last longer
than "a few days."

429
00:21:08,328 --> 00:21:09,720
Sure.

430
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:12,114
Right, well,

431
00:21:12,158 --> 00:21:15,074
I'm gonna go, uh, check for
circuits for the generator.

432
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,729
See if anyone needs help.

433
00:21:30,611 --> 00:21:32,134
Tell me

434
00:21:32,178 --> 00:21:33,918
that she has something over you.

435
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:35,659
Just doing my job.

436
00:21:35,703 --> 00:21:36,965
Really?

437
00:21:37,008 --> 00:21:38,880
'Cause I thought
we were friends, Soraya.

438
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,057
After everything
that we went through.

439
00:21:46,757 --> 00:21:48,324
Now you feel like talking?

440
00:21:48,368 --> 00:21:50,021
That doesn't belong to you.

441
00:21:50,065 --> 00:21:53,155
Where did you get it?

442
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:57,072
All you have to do is tell us
where your brother is, Jharrel.

443
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,988
It's not rocket science.

444
00:22:02,164 --> 00:22:03,948
It's like I don't even know you.

445
00:22:03,992 --> 00:22:06,603
Then you haven't been
paying attention.

446
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:10,999
Jha, pay attention.

447
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:14,350
Tostones with mojo sauce
is my favorite.

448
00:22:14,394 --> 00:22:15,458
How are you supposed
to make them for Carla

449
00:22:15,482 --> 00:22:16,787
if you learn know how, huh?

450
00:22:16,831 --> 00:22:19,050
You asked me to show you
how to make this.

451
00:22:19,094 --> 00:22:21,401
It's all about timing.

452
00:22:21,444 --> 00:22:23,751
I still can't smell or taste,

453
00:22:23,794 --> 00:22:26,188
and you literally have one job:
Just mash the plantains

454
00:22:26,232 --> 00:22:28,190
for a second fry. Yes, yes.

455
00:22:28,234 --> 00:22:30,845
Sorry. Yes, one job:
Mash plantains.

456
00:22:30,888 --> 00:22:32,368
Got a news alert.

457
00:22:32,412 --> 00:22:35,676
Looks like vaccines are
right around the corner.

458
00:22:37,678 --> 00:22:39,680
Hey, hey, you survived,
all right?

459
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:41,116
That's all that matters.

460
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,900
Look how far we've gotten.

461
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,555
Now I'm glad that we
can both get the shot.

462
00:22:47,253 --> 00:22:49,646
You know, I never knew
that you could cook.

463
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,388
Well, I feel like you never got
a chance to know me, you know?

464
00:22:52,432 --> 00:22:53,650
Back then.

465
00:22:53,694 --> 00:22:55,652
Mm. What?

466
00:22:55,696 --> 00:22:58,046
You gonna read me like one
of your social work clients?

467
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:00,222
Tell me that
"feelings aren't facts"?

468
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:05,923
No, I am just going to say
I'm sorry.

469
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:09,188
You know, I'm sorry I didn't
see you for you back then.

470
00:23:09,231 --> 00:23:10,885
I do now.

471
00:23:12,756 --> 00:23:14,105
Hey, uh, you okay?

472
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:15,759
Sorry to wake you up.

473
00:23:15,803 --> 00:23:17,805
I know you said I should
conserve my battery,

474
00:23:17,848 --> 00:23:20,547
but I said I'd check in, and...

475
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:24,028
I wanted to talk to you
about earlier.

476
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:26,509
What did you want to...
Andre and I are dating.

477
00:23:27,945 --> 00:23:30,600
Is that, um...

478
00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:32,385
weird for you?

479
00:23:32,428 --> 00:23:34,691
No, not at all. Um...

480
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:37,564
I'm-I'm happy for you.

481
00:23:37,607 --> 00:23:41,132
Yeah, I met him on our Ypsi Med
adventure and he had this

482
00:23:41,176 --> 00:23:44,527
"everything old is new"
kind of vibe that I dug.

483
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,967
I kind of have a crush myself,
actually,

484
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,970
I just haven't really
mentioned it till now.

485
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,756
And you're telling me?

486
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:59,455
That's... that's awesome.

487
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:01,849
Let me guess.

488
00:24:01,892 --> 00:24:03,807
Hayden?

489
00:24:06,114 --> 00:24:07,289
Mildred.

490
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,638
Actually.

491
00:24:08,682 --> 00:24:09,726
Yeah, I mean, she's fierce

492
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,294
and she's strong and she's...

493
00:24:12,338 --> 00:24:15,428
she's amazing and...

494
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:18,300
Uh, is-is that weird for you?

495
00:24:18,344 --> 00:24:20,824
Not at all.

496
00:24:22,217 --> 00:24:25,438
Surprised, but...

497
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:27,483
I'm just grateful that you felt
comfortable enough

498
00:24:27,527 --> 00:24:29,268
to share that with me.

499
00:24:33,184 --> 00:24:35,970
I, um...

500
00:24:36,013 --> 00:24:39,800
Shanice, I-I didn't know
how you were gonna fit

501
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:41,889
into my life before.

502
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:50,027
I mean, maybe this is who we can
be to each other, you know?

503
00:24:52,378 --> 00:24:55,859
Mariah, I will always be here
to listen.

504
00:24:55,903 --> 00:24:57,905
If-if you need.

505
00:24:57,948 --> 00:24:59,863
Thanks.

506
00:24:59,907 --> 00:25:01,691
And ditto.

507
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,781
Good night, Shanice.

508
00:25:14,704 --> 00:25:16,619
You're making tear gas?

509
00:25:16,663 --> 00:25:20,014
Like the feds used
at Kent State?

510
00:25:20,057 --> 00:25:22,712
I'm not sure what
you're referring to,

511
00:25:22,756 --> 00:25:23,950
but I assume they used
government-issue.

512
00:25:23,974 --> 00:25:25,193
Mine's homemade.

513
00:25:25,236 --> 00:25:26,716
I have no doubt

514
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,370
the government is tracking
our purchases.

515
00:25:28,414 --> 00:25:29,850
Especially online.

516
00:25:29,893 --> 00:25:31,808
Online?

517
00:25:31,852 --> 00:25:34,115
The scariest word
in modern jargon.

518
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:39,207
This little thing is a passport
to everything and everyone.

519
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,514
It's how the
government tracks us

520
00:25:41,557 --> 00:25:43,211
and how our enemies organize.

521
00:25:43,254 --> 00:25:45,779
Uh, there's a page
called the 44orum,

522
00:25:45,822 --> 00:25:48,521
and the hate that is on there,

523
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:51,393
the things people talk
about doing to us...

524
00:25:51,437 --> 00:25:54,265
And tear gas is gonna stop them?

525
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:56,746
From organizing? No.

526
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,836
The tear gas is for when
they take action.

527
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,230
And believe you me, they will.

528
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:07,975
We have been scaring them
with our mere existence

529
00:26:08,018 --> 00:26:09,324
before we ever fought back.

530
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:13,981
What you did gave the 4,400 hope

531
00:26:14,024 --> 00:26:16,636
that fighting back
was even possible.

532
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,378
And now they see us as a threat.

533
00:26:20,944 --> 00:26:23,382
So we're gonna be ready
to defend ourselves.

534
00:26:24,426 --> 00:26:25,819
I've been learning

535
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:27,951
a lot about
the state of things in 2021.

536
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:31,912
You weren't really
at bartending school, were you?

537
00:26:37,047 --> 00:26:40,181
And instead of disguising you
with a new look,

538
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,270
I got a better idea.

539
00:26:42,313 --> 00:26:44,664
But we still gonna need to make
you over.

540
00:26:47,623 --> 00:26:51,453
We have to trust each other in
the storm yet to come, Mildred.

541
00:27:01,507 --> 00:27:04,074
Okay.

542
00:27:04,118 --> 00:27:05,380
Do it.

543
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:22,919
You have a problem
with gay people?

544
00:27:22,963 --> 00:27:26,357
I don't have a problem
with the sinner, just the sin.

545
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:28,708
But there are ways to change,
if one so chooses.

546
00:27:28,751 --> 00:27:30,250
Okay, I'm-a to stop you
right there, Isaiah.

547
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:34,017
I am who I am.

548
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:37,412
I love who I love,
and I love how I love.

549
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,675
This is how I was made,

550
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:43,418
and I am proud of exactly
all of it.

551
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:45,725
Is that how everyone is now?

552
00:27:45,768 --> 00:27:51,252
My son apparently seems
to be like you.

553
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,341
That's why you won't reach
out to him?

554
00:27:53,384 --> 00:27:55,561
He's not the man
I thought he'd be.

555
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:56,910
You don't even know him.

556
00:27:56,953 --> 00:27:58,477
I am a man of God.

557
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,262
A man of faith.
You can't just go against...

558
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:04,134
Please, Isaiah, it is 2021.
You got to get with it.

559
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,880
Plenty of faiths invite
all kinds of people now.

560
00:28:10,924 --> 00:28:13,230
Lots of God-loving people
have realized

561
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,494
who the real sinners are:
It's those that hate,

562
00:28:15,537 --> 00:28:18,192
not those who love
for the sake of love

563
00:28:18,235 --> 00:28:20,542
without the conditions
based off some old book.

564
00:28:20,586 --> 00:28:22,152
I don't hate.

565
00:28:22,196 --> 00:28:25,155
Oh, but prejudice is hate.
Just call it what it is.

566
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:27,307
I heard the same kind of crap
from people just like you

567
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,768
growing up, and I...

568
00:28:28,811 --> 00:28:30,944
I'd hoped that you were
different.

569
00:28:32,946 --> 00:28:36,471
But, hey, sometimes people
don't surprise you.

570
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,390
Then... why'd you help me?

571
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:48,875
Hello?

572
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:50,572
Hey.

573
00:28:50,616 --> 00:28:52,313
Hey, we're in here.
Please, help us!

574
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,489
Hello? Is someone in there?

575
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,230
Yes, we've been trapped
in here. Please.

576
00:28:56,273 --> 00:29:00,103
- Okay, sit tight.
- I'm gonna get you out, okay?

577
00:29:03,977 --> 00:29:06,719
Thank God.

578
00:29:06,762 --> 00:29:09,373
Buildings like this
have generators

579
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:10,940
specifically for the elevators.

580
00:29:10,984 --> 00:29:12,768
But the technology failed.

581
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:14,378
Well, more likely
someone turned it off,

582
00:29:14,422 --> 00:29:16,293
I'm guessing on purpose,

583
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,600
because the door to
the generator is locked tight.

584
00:29:18,644 --> 00:29:22,909
Ah, another parting gift
our government friends left us.

585
00:29:22,952 --> 00:29:24,954
So you, uh, you know
how to pick locks, huh?

586
00:29:24,998 --> 00:29:28,784
As I said, I believe
I can open this door,

587
00:29:28,828 --> 00:29:30,786
efficiently and with haste.

588
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:34,050
And you really learned
all this stuff in the war?

589
00:29:34,094 --> 00:29:35,530
Like World War I?

590
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:37,967
The war to end all wars.

591
00:29:38,011 --> 00:29:40,274
Instead, it was merely
but the first.

592
00:29:40,317 --> 00:29:43,625
Full of needless
suffering and loss.

593
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:46,585
You know, I actually met Shanice
protesting one.

594
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:53,853
Oh, you know what?
I probably... I've got to have

595
00:29:53,896 --> 00:29:57,334
one of Mariah's bobby pins
in my... I'm not picking the lock.

596
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,162
What?

597
00:29:59,206 --> 00:30:00,381
Kindly back away.

598
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:07,214
What are you...

599
00:30:07,257 --> 00:30:08,868
Geez.

600
00:30:20,749 --> 00:30:22,969
We know your brother's
been sending you messages.

601
00:30:23,012 --> 00:30:24,816
Tell me what he was trying
to tell you with this.

602
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,450
I don't know,
why don't you ask him?

603
00:30:26,494 --> 00:30:28,496
Oh, wait, that's right.
You don't have him!

604
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:30,193
His code is in here
somewhere, J.

605
00:30:30,237 --> 00:30:31,760
What's it saying? You got me.

606
00:30:31,804 --> 00:30:34,415
What's it say? What's it saying, J?

607
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,069
I don't know, Soraya!

608
00:30:36,112 --> 00:30:41,596
Then you haven't
been paying attention.

609
00:30:57,351 --> 00:31:02,573
My brother is all
that I have thought about

610
00:31:02,617 --> 00:31:04,532
for a year.

611
00:31:04,575 --> 00:31:07,709
Because I haven't seen him
or spoken to him

612
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:10,364
since the day
that he went missing

613
00:31:10,407 --> 00:31:12,888
or was taken or whatever.

614
00:31:12,932 --> 00:31:16,587
All that I have thought about
is finding him.

615
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,636
Do I seem like a guy
who has found him?

616
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,205
The only thing that
I can confirm on record

617
00:31:25,248 --> 00:31:28,295
is that this was
his favorite book.

618
00:31:28,338 --> 00:31:31,907
And he doodled in this book like
he doodles in all of his books.

619
00:31:33,822 --> 00:31:37,260
I do not know where he is

620
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:39,436
any more than you do.

621
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,264
You can keep me here
all you want,

622
00:31:41,308 --> 00:31:43,179
but I cannot help you.

623
00:31:53,842 --> 00:31:57,063
All right, we're done here.
You're free to go.

624
00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:02,633
Thank you.

625
00:32:25,047 --> 00:32:27,789
And thank God for that,

626
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:30,836
ladies and gentlegays.

627
00:32:35,971 --> 00:32:37,930
I never meant to offend you.

628
00:32:37,973 --> 00:32:42,369
Thank you,
for your help in there.

629
00:32:42,412 --> 00:32:45,502
You asked before
why I helped you.

630
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,548
I know my Bible, too.

631
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:50,159
Judge not lest ye be judged.

632
00:32:50,203 --> 00:32:51,813
Yes. Matthew 7.

633
00:32:51,857 --> 00:32:54,729
I know it. Do you?

634
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:57,210
I won't tell the people who
follow you how you truly feel

635
00:32:57,253 --> 00:32:59,168
about some of them.

636
00:32:59,212 --> 00:33:01,040
They see you as their leader.

637
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:03,869
Wouldn't want to crush
their faith.

638
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:05,827
Thank you.

639
00:33:05,871 --> 00:33:07,655
I appreciate your...

640
00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:10,353
You can do that on your own.

641
00:33:10,397 --> 00:33:14,140
But just this once,
though, I am gonna judge.

642
00:33:14,183 --> 00:33:16,142
I am so happy

643
00:33:16,185 --> 00:33:18,492
you weren't there to put
your son through that crap.

644
00:33:18,535 --> 00:33:20,644
Knowing what I do about you,
even if you weren't taken

645
00:33:20,668 --> 00:33:22,365
by that green light,
you would've vanished

646
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:23,845
from his life anyway.

647
00:33:26,413 --> 00:33:28,894
So he better off without you.

648
00:33:42,211 --> 00:33:43,473
Hey.

649
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,694
Oh, my God,
what happened to you?

650
00:33:48,522 --> 00:33:50,176
Look, I will fill you in later,

651
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:53,005
I promise, but Keisha...

652
00:33:54,093 --> 00:33:56,095
Manny is back.

653
00:33:56,138 --> 00:33:58,227
Okay, how did Soraya
get this book to you

654
00:33:58,271 --> 00:33:59,465
if you were being held
in custody?

655
00:33:59,489 --> 00:34:00,926
No matter what it looks like,

656
00:34:00,969 --> 00:34:02,797
just know that
she is on our side.

657
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,716
1, 2, 6, 9, 16.

658
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:10,761
Those are the numbers
from the drawings, right?

659
00:34:10,805 --> 00:34:12,067
Okay.

660
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:14,548
First two digits: Page 12.

661
00:34:14,591 --> 00:34:17,856
6 and 9 are 69 sentences in.

662
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:19,248
And 16 spaces

663
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:21,163
into that sentence is the phrase

664
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:26,212
"would turn white with fury."

665
00:34:26,255 --> 00:34:27,909
Wood. White.

666
00:34:27,953 --> 00:34:30,564
You translate that into French
and you get...

667
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:32,827
"Bois Blanc."

668
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:35,917
Okay, so you think
he's here, at the hotel?

669
00:34:35,961 --> 00:34:37,701
Yes. Where?

670
00:34:37,745 --> 00:34:39,834
This place is huge. I don't know.

671
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,401
That's where I'm stumped.

672
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:43,838
I think that I...

673
00:34:46,188 --> 00:34:48,234
Wait, no, that...

674
00:34:48,277 --> 00:34:51,715
This hour hand
wasn't here before.

675
00:34:51,759 --> 00:34:53,084
What do you mean? When... I don't know,

676
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:54,980
But it's got to be
the final clue.

677
00:34:55,023 --> 00:34:57,156
It's not even pointing
to a number, it's pointing

678
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,785
at the space between
the two and the six.

679
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:00,637
I don't get it.

680
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,813
I do.

681
00:35:02,857 --> 00:35:06,643
That space is a number.

682
00:35:08,994 --> 00:35:11,692
Yo, yo. What up, though,
little bro?

683
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,128
Come see, come see.

684
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,175
With the vaccines
rolling out soon,

685
00:35:16,218 --> 00:35:18,351
coinciding nicely with
the end of my house arrest,

686
00:35:18,394 --> 00:35:19,656
my juices are starting to flow.

687
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,962
Ready to get back to work.

688
00:35:21,006 --> 00:35:22,877
They probably thought
you were gonna cave.

689
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:24,618
But you didn't.

690
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:31,364
I'm proud of you.

691
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,044
You asked me the other day
what it is

692
00:35:40,068 --> 00:35:41,548
I actually do for work.

693
00:35:41,591 --> 00:35:43,767
I thought it'd be easier
if I just showed you.

694
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:49,034
Now, what do you think
the pineapple, the buttercup,

695
00:35:49,077 --> 00:35:51,645
the seashell and the pine
cone all have in common?

696
00:35:53,516 --> 00:35:56,911
All things we found half-eaten
by Grandma Lisi's iguana?

697
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:58,869
Okay, well, I can't
actually deny that.

698
00:35:58,913 --> 00:36:02,482
But they also share
the golden ratio.

699
00:36:02,525 --> 00:36:04,005
A mathematical principle

700
00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:06,007
that's also called
"nature's secret code."

701
00:36:06,051 --> 00:36:08,531
Now, this 13th-century
mathematician Fibonacci,

702
00:36:08,575 --> 00:36:11,491
he examined the distance
between numbers in a sequence.

703
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:14,929
And what he found was that
the space between our reality

704
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:17,018
exists as its own and
often holds ours together.

705
00:36:17,062 --> 00:36:18,498
Are you following me so far?

706
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:20,326
Uh, yeah, sure.

707
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:23,764
So this golden ratio maintains
a delicate and invisible balance

708
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,331
that's found in
everything, from,

709
00:36:25,374 --> 00:36:29,335
from hurricanes to dolphins
to DNA.

710
00:36:29,378 --> 00:36:33,078
To, believe it or not,
time itself.

711
00:36:35,906 --> 00:36:37,473
What I do is think about
what happens

712
00:36:37,517 --> 00:36:40,476
if you alter that ratio.

713
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,566
If you fundamentally change
the space between spaces,

714
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,047
how might that affect...

715
00:36:46,091 --> 00:36:48,093
well, the world as we know it.

716
00:36:50,617 --> 00:36:52,097
Man.

717
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,142
People pay you
to think about this?

718
00:36:54,186 --> 00:36:56,362
Not just think about it.

719
00:36:56,405 --> 00:36:59,278
But as for now,

720
00:36:59,321 --> 00:37:01,106
I'm gonna go get us
some tamales.

721
00:37:01,149 --> 00:37:03,430
And when I get back, I want
to hear your take on all this.

722
00:37:04,587 --> 00:37:06,676
I'm really starting to value
your view of the world.

723
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,279
I have to find the space
between spaces.

724
00:37:44,323 --> 00:37:48,109
Okay? Between two
and six is four.

725
00:37:48,153 --> 00:37:51,852
Between six and nine is three.

726
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,724
Between nine and 16 is seven...

727
00:37:55,725 --> 00:37:58,728
Four, three, seven.

728
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:02,123
Room 437.

729
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:04,256
I mean, you think...

730
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:05,779
Is it possible
that Manny's there?

731
00:38:05,822 --> 00:38:09,348
I can go with you and find out.

732
00:38:09,391 --> 00:38:11,306
Uh, no.

733
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,526
If I'm right, it's probably
better if I go alone.

734
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:16,746
And if you're wrong?

735
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:20,446
Well, then, I definitely
want to be alone.

736
00:38:20,489 --> 00:38:22,970
Thank you, Keish.

737
00:38:23,013 --> 00:38:24,667
For believing in me.

738
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:26,408
And my brother.

739
00:38:26,452 --> 00:38:28,323
For all of it.

740
00:38:30,456 --> 00:38:32,197
Hey, Jharrel?

741
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,938
Use the stairs.

742
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:37,158
Well, I must admit...

743
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:40,659
your knowledge of generators
was quite impressive.

744
00:38:40,683 --> 00:38:43,599
Well... I-I certainly understand
their value.

745
00:38:43,643 --> 00:38:45,186
Yeah, well, we wouldn't have
been able to rescue them

746
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,646
if we couldn't get
into the room.

747
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:48,952
I mean, when you blew the lock

748
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:51,346
right off the door,
it was amazing, man.

749
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,869
I know.

750
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,220
We made a really
good team up there.

751
00:38:55,263 --> 00:38:57,309
It was pretty cool
getting to know you.

752
00:38:57,352 --> 00:39:01,182
Ah, I-I got to say,
I'm digging this bromance.

753
00:39:01,226 --> 00:39:04,142
My, what a compliment, Logan.

754
00:39:04,185 --> 00:39:07,275
And while I appreciate
your ingenuity

755
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:11,627
and, uh, enthusiasm,
quite frankly...

756
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,805
you're just not my type.

757
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:20,506
Oh, no, that's-that's
not what bromance...

758
00:39:27,252 --> 00:39:29,689
I can see why she likes you.

759
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,044
I thought the generator
you turned on

760
00:39:37,087 --> 00:39:38,741
was just for the elevators.

761
00:39:38,785 --> 00:39:40,221
It is.

762
00:39:40,265 --> 00:39:41,945
Someone must have turned
the power back on.

763
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:46,488
All right. Well, uh,
I should get out of here.

764
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:48,969
Hey.

765
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,710
This was pretty cool, Andre.

766
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:10,686
It worked. The FOMOFundMe page

767
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,646
Mariah set up is fully funded,
by a single donation.

768
00:40:13,689 --> 00:40:15,256
Remarkable news.Yes.

769
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,606
A-And who might
our generous benefactor be?

770
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,826
Not who. What.

771
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:21,262
Some company, BHN.

772
00:40:21,306 --> 00:40:23,221
They commented
on our fundraising page,

773
00:40:23,264 --> 00:40:25,875
"In solidarity.
We are all 4,400."

774
00:40:25,919 --> 00:40:28,878
And they just issued
a press release.

775
00:40:28,922 --> 00:40:30,769
Apparently, they just bought
the Bois Blanc, too.

776
00:40:30,793 --> 00:40:34,884
Uh, though I hate to ask,
who are they?

777
00:40:34,928 --> 00:40:38,236
And what might this company's
vested interest in us be?

778
00:40:38,279 --> 00:40:40,150
I'm asking myself
the same question.

779
00:40:40,194 --> 00:40:41,456
Right now, they're saving us.

780
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,025
I'll take any win at the moment.

781
00:40:46,722 --> 00:40:48,768
Well done, my dear.

782
00:41:09,441 --> 00:41:11,834
Manny?

783
00:41:16,796 --> 00:41:18,319
I don't know...

784
00:41:18,363 --> 00:41:20,278
I don't, I don't understand,

785
00:41:24,978 --> 00:41:26,849
Did I get it wrong?

786
00:41:48,828 --> 00:41:51,961
You found me, Jha.
I'm all right.

787
00:41:54,616 --> 00:41:56,488
And I'm sorry for everything.

788
00:42:01,406 --> 00:42:03,625
What up, though, little bro?

789
00:42:03,669 --> 00:42:05,975
