1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,399
What a night, y'all.

2
00:00:08,443 --> 00:00:10,836
I mean,
we snuck out to Belle Isle.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,014
Noah, like, nap-timed
the chaperones with his voice,

4
00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:15,841
and Mildred... you floated Rev

5
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:17,191
like a butterfly.

6
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:18,888
I have never seen
such trippy stuff sober.

7
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:21,456
You guys are like superheroes.

8
00:00:21,499 --> 00:00:22,868
Like, with your own origin
story and everything.

9
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:24,024
I guess that makes me

10
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,175
the Kardashian of the group.

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,635
Like, bringing a dash

12
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:28,289
of reality TV fame
to spice things up.

13
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:30,247
What's a reality TV?

14
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,292
What's a TV?

15
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:33,381
TV is like radio you watch

16
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:34,512
like talkies.

17
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,645
And then reality TV is where

18
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:37,709
you get, like, a bunch
of regular people

19
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:39,387
with different personalities,

20
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,867
and you film, like,
all the drama that unfolds.

21
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:44,150
So, like, for example, so,
like, Shanice... she's our rebel,

22
00:00:44,174 --> 00:00:45,610
so she clashes with Rev,

23
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:47,351
the golden boy.
And then, Mildred,

24
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:49,199
you and Hayden are, like,
the "will they, won't they."

25
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:50,441
Will they, won't they what?

26
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:54,793
Just wait.

27
00:00:54,837 --> 00:00:56,099
So, then, what are you?

28
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:57,405
Obviously, I'm the star.

29
00:00:57,448 --> 00:00:58,841
But nobody knows that

30
00:00:58,884 --> 00:01:00,060
because I do not have cameras

31
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:02,105
following me around anymore.

32
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:04,629
God, I miss being famous.

33
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:08,503
Oh, my God, Mariah.

34
00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:10,287
Wh... What?

35
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:14,596
But how did you get in here?

36
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:16,946
Does your father
know you're here?

37
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:19,446
He wasn't gonna let me, but
I-I really wanted to see you. Okay,

38
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,732
but...

39
00:01:20,776 --> 00:01:22,821
How? How are you here?

40
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:25,041
Some guy. I-I think he said
his name was Hayden.

41
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,042
He opened the door for me,

42
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,652
and... I don't know.

43
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:29,326
I guess I just...
I really wanted to meet you.

44
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,961
And I didn't think much past...

45
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:34,224
Making it happen? Yeah.

46
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:36,879
Hotheaded runs in the family.
Really?

47
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:40,012
Wow.

48
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,191
Oh, come here.

49
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:50,153
I love you so much, Mom.

50
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:58,379
What was that?

51
00:01:58,422 --> 00:02:00,555
What? I...

52
00:02:00,598 --> 00:02:02,470
I...

53
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:04,124
You...

54
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,213
Um, a-are you okay?

55
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:09,346
Yeah. Yes, I just...

56
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,956
I...

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,220
I really need you to know,
t... to tell you

58
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:14,786
that you were...

59
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,312
You aremy world.

60
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:20,836
I never would have left you
by choice.

61
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,533
Okay.

62
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:25,493
But Dad told me
you wrote a letter,

63
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:27,495
so... No, I never wrote a letter.

64
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:28,818
I... You never wrote the letter?

65
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:31,238
Okay, well, okay, I did, but...

66
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:33,327
So you just lied to me? No.

67
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,067
It's not like that. I'm just...

68
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:38,680
I'm-I'm just confused,
and I-I saw...

69
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:43,206
You have this...
this Bridget person,

70
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,903
and-and... Wow. Okay,

71
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:46,747
what does Bridget have to do
with you leaving?

72
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:51,345
I don't know
why I thought I could trust you.

73
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:52,955
This was a mistake. No, M-Mariah.

74
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:54,391
Wait. Please.

75
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:56,350
Just...

76
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,841
This crowd has
doubled since last night.

77
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:11,669
I just hope
Mariah got home okay.

78
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:14,629
But how did your
daughter get in?

79
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:16,824
- She said Hayden let her in.
- I guess that's why

80
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:17,928
he didn't go to Belle Isle.

81
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:20,548
He can see the future.

82
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:22,245
No big deal.

83
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:23,725
Anyway,

84
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:24,726
your daughter
sounds like a badass.

85
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:26,075
It's probably not her first time

86
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,400
sneaking back in at dawn.

87
00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:29,513
Quite the hullabaloo.

88
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:30,732
And all over us. This is

89
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:32,603
all good for us, okay?

90
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:35,650
No publicity is bad publicity
as far as we're concerned.

91
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:38,218
It keeps us in the public eye
and out of the shadows.

92
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:39,741
But the government

93
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:40,916
is a different story.

94
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:44,920
Steve said they're trying
to have some press event soon.

95
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:46,704
They want all this to go away.

96
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:49,011
ASAP.You're on a first-name basis
with the guards?

97
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:50,360
The papers will be here?

98
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:52,057
Just Steve.

99
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:53,711
And we don't really do
paper anymore,

100
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:54,930
but yes, reporters.

101
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:56,410
You seem an expert on the press.

102
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:58,194
Being on camera
used to be my job.

103
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,848
On celluloid film?

104
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:02,807
Well,
it's digital now, but yeah.

105
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:04,611
I was actually shooting
my own reality show when...

106
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:06,637
this happened.
Perhaps

107
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:09,249
someone documented the
precise moment you were taken,

108
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:11,425
then. I don't know.
It's all pretty blurry.

109
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:14,297
I remember drinking a lot

110
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:16,430
and then arriving on Belle Isle.

111
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:18,345
I must have been really trashed.

112
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:22,087
Um, I was shooting
my premiere episode.

113
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:28,703
This one. Oh, no.

114
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:30,835
Your body would do nothing
for that dress.

115
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:34,815
Have you thought more
about me getting my degree?

116
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,928
I think it could be
kind of good for me.

117
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:39,757
Computer science. What a waste.

118
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:42,325
You wouldn't even have time, anyway.
Dad thinks I can manage...

119
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:43,911
Exactly why you know
that's a terrible idea.

120
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:45,241
Look, being fabulous

121
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,852
is your full-time job now.

122
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:49,898
Fix your priorities.

123
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:51,900
And fix your face.
You got a zit coming in.

124
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:54,076
Cut!

125
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,054
That was harsh, Mom.
Even for the cameras.

126
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:58,994
Uh-uh, that wasn't for
the cameras. I meant every word.

127
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:00,952
You need to think
about your brand,

128
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:02,040
not your brain.

129
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:06,958
Hey.

130
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:09,047
Don't worry about
your mom, okay?

131
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:10,484
This is about you

132
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,927
coming out
of the ex-wives franchise

133
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:13,182
with your very own spin-off.

134
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:16,403
You are our future,
right? Our star.

135
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:22,452
You know what?

136
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:24,411
If they're gonna bring in
the press,

137
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:27,065
I'm gonna make myself
the star this show needs.

138
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:28,763
Hey!

139
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:31,374
No loitering in the hallways.

140
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:32,462
Get to breakfast.

141
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:33,700
Get to breakfast.

142
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:38,686
I wouldn't eat that.

143
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,302
What is that?
A mate in three puzzle.

144
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,651
It's a way

145
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:49,305
to play my favorite game
without a set.

146
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,177
Chess. Hayden.

147
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:53,541
Mildred told me
it's your birthday

148
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,963
tomorrow.
We are gonna party.

149
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:56,704
How old will you be?

150
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:00,447
Well, a party

151
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,207
is something to, like,
actually look forward to,

152
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:03,556
you know? We're
gonna make it sick.

153
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,582
I don't know how or with what,

154
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:08,455
but, by Gandalf, I'm excited.

155
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:14,852
Hey, Hay, was I not
supposed to say anything?

156
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:16,506
Just don't like my birthday.

157
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,465
There was... I mean, is...

158
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:21,293
Never much to celebrate
when you're locked up.

159
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:36,004
Your move, bro.

160
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,009
Yo, texpert.

161
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:43,577
Hey. What's up, J?

162
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,448
Okay, did anybody
pass through here last night

163
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:47,058
when we were... No.

164
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:49,017
I checked CCTV
soon as I got your text.

165
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,628
Okay, but then who drew this?

166
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:52,760
And when?

167
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:54,762
No idea.

168
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:56,503
It's a mystery.

169
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:58,263
On top of the mystery
of what happened at Belle Isle,

170
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:00,681
well, twice.

171
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:02,963
Wait, do you have a theory on
what put us to sleep out there?

172
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:03,945
Working through
Keisha's body cam footage,

173
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:05,599
but nothing yet.

174
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,689
I should update her.

175
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:10,865
It'd give us a reason to talk.

176
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:22,050
These are for you.

177
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:27,466
Now that we're all
here, tomorrow,

178
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,492
we're holding a press event

179
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:31,842
to catch the public up
on the 4,400 situation

180
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,453
and dispel any rumors

181
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:34,821
that have been swirling
around them.

182
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:36,499
Carla Coleman

183
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:37,607
from the mayor's office
will be running the event.

184
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:39,284
Carla.

185
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:41,504
Thank you, Agent Tanner.

186
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:49,381
Thanks to the leak,
which DHS is still working on,

187
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:51,340
the public knows that
4,400 missing persons

188
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:52,950
appeared on Belle Isle

189
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:54,343
and are being detained.

190
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:55,997
That is all they know.

191
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,540
It's gonna be our job
to remind them of that

192
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:59,391
by removing any space
for speculation.

193
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:01,524
In your packets, you will see
approved statements,

194
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:05,180
the reporters in attendance
and an outline of the event.

195
00:08:05,223 --> 00:08:06,834
Agent Tanner also tells me
a few of you

196
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:08,183
will be tasked with finding

197
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:09,924
an ambassador among the 4,400.

198
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,230
This is going to be key,
as the public needs

199
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:13,754
to put a face to the situation.

200
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:16,278
You want me and Jharrel
to find this person?

201
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:18,585
Okay, look, my job is
to advocate for the residents,

202
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:21,239
not to play ball
for some government spin job.

203
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:22,956
None of the family members
have even been notified.

204
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,766
The mayor believes the sooner
the public has answers,

205
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:27,028
the sooner we can all focus

206
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:29,117
on returning the 4,400

207
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,554
to society
and moving on with our lives.

208
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:32,947
Everybody else, your job

209
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,862
is to get this place cleaned up.

210
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:36,603
We want the world to see
what a safe

211
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:39,910
and welcoming environment
we have provided here.

212
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:41,912
Sorry.

213
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:43,803
I should have
given you a heads-up.

214
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:45,525
I-I didn't... No, no.

215
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:46,787
It's all good.

216
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,311
How have you been?

217
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:51,574
I'm good. And you?

218
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:53,184
Actually, I was wondering,

219
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:55,273
is... is Manny...

220
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:58,015
I-I know the 4,400
are missing persons.No.

221
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:00,104
Manny's not a 4,400.

222
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:02,629
Not officially.

223
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:04,326
What does that mean?

224
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,503
Look at this.

225
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:12,334
It's Manny's tag.

226
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,729
Look, this appeared last night.

227
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,121
Only he could have drawn this.

228
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,296
This is a circle.

229
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,515
No. No, this...

230
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,908
It's his signature.

231
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:22,474
Look, he draws a circle

232
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:23,887
and the first number,
and then I come in

233
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:24,825
with a second number,
and we take turns

234
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:26,435
until there's 12, but...

235
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:28,568
Look, I think he's here,

236
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:29,936
and he's trying to
tell me something.

237
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,658
Okay.

238
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:34,182
So, Manny came back
with the other 4,400

239
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,966
on Belle Isle,

240
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,620
but instead of telling you
he's back,

241
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:40,580
he's skulking around,
leaving cryptic drawings?

242
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:42,669
This isn't like before.

243
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:44,061
This is exactly like before.

244
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:46,107
Manny went missing
and you got obsessed.

245
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,326
You followed every lead,

246
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,633
and then you made up leads
when those ran dry.

247
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:54,202
Spent every night at his place
waiting for him to return.

248
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:55,812
Never coming home.

249
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:58,162
Carla, I'm sorry.

250
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:00,164
All right, I know I wasn't great

251
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,123
back then, but...

252
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,779
I'm not gonna give up on him.

253
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:07,476
And wrecking your whole life,

254
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,392
going on these
wild goose chases...

255
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:11,630
You really think
that's what Manny

256
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:12,829
would want for you, Jharrel?

257
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:14,657
I mean,
you already lost one job.

258
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,050
Well, I'm not losing this one.

259
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:19,096
This job at this hotel

260
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,740
is the only chance I have
of finding him.

261
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:25,363
Good luck, Jharrel.

262
00:10:28,802 --> 00:10:30,804
Hey.

263
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:34,285
There's my favorite
rebel social worker.

264
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:38,159
FYI, you'll be doing
a tailored statement

265
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:39,726
at the event tomorrow.

266
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:41,771
The public likes social workers.

267
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:43,817
And if I'd rather
jump off a cliff?

268
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:47,559
Keisha thinks
you're a bleeding heart,

269
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:49,799
but I think you just don't know
how to be a team player. Oh, I do.

270
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,128
Just not when the game
is rigged.

271
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:53,391
Look, I need this job,

272
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:56,003
but I'm here to advocate,
not to be a puppet.

273
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:57,526
The game has changed.

274
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:59,833
If you want in,
here's your speech.

275
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:01,573
Memorize it.

276
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:04,098
Play ball, or you're out.

277
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:17,851
Today, we are
interviewing residents

278
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:20,592
to be potential
press ambassadors.

279
00:11:20,636 --> 00:11:22,290
I think

280
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,726
you might actually be great

281
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,686
at the job.
And it could be fun. A job?

282
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:27,861
Is this a paid position?

283
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:30,037
No.

284
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,865
And how would you rate
your oration skills?

285
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,433
Okay.

286
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:38,436
Gonna take that
as below average.

287
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,221
So,

288
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:41,744
how do you feel
about public speaking?

289
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:45,835
Me too.

290
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,315
No worries.

291
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:50,187
What tactics would you use

292
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:51,449
with an upset reporter?

293
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:52,494
Michigan Penal Code.

294
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:55,366
Article three...

295
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,846
twenty-eight.

296
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,022
A person who commits
unlawful imprisonment

297
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:01,895
is guilty of a felony punishable

298
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:04,854
by imprisonment for
not more than 15 years

299
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:07,422
or a fine
of not more than $20,000.

300
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:08,989
Or both.

301
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:12,427
So, you want me,

302
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,733
a Black woman being held

303
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:15,256
against her will,

304
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:16,779
to do all this work for free?

305
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:19,347
Fun.

306
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,001
Oh, geez.

307
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:25,701
Did you have your interview

308
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,833
for the papers? Nope.

309
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,269
Wasn't asked.

310
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:30,837
Doubt I have the face they want.

311
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,577
There does seem to be

312
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:34,014
an air of baloney involved.

313
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:36,712
But...

314
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,932
when the reporters are around,

315
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:41,891
if you get nervous,
remember not to sing.

316
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:43,937
It would be extremely dangerous

317
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,503
if your powers
made the front page.

318
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,027
I can't always help it.

319
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,289
Try?

320
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,772
Is everything all right, Noah?

321
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,861
Where's
your usual joie de vivre?

322
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:57,689
I-I don't love doctors.

323
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,300
No offense.

324
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:00,756
Mine haven't been
the most supportive humans

325
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,303
in my life. I see.

326
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:05,132
Is there anything
I can help you with?

327
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:12,313
I need this medicine.

328
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:13,531
I haven't

329
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:14,794
had it in a week.

330
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:25,282
I'm transgender.

331
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:26,631
I need this

332
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:27,981
to be my true self.

333
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:32,072
Transgender? Yeah.

334
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:34,988
When I was born,
they said I was a girl,

335
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:37,904
but clearly, I-I'm not.

336
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:41,081
Do you hide this?

337
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:43,126
It's no secret. I'm proud of it.

338
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,432
I'm out to basically everyone.

339
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,523
Well, this is all...

340
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:52,875
remarkable.

341
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,746
Sorry, Doc.
Did I blow your mind?

342
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,010
Well, you've...

343
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:01,014
certainly expanded
my vocabulary.

344
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:02,711
Thank you for sharing.

345
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:04,844
And you can count on me

346
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,237
to procure
the medicine you need.

347
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:09,196
Thanks.

348
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:15,506
It is such a waste that
they're interviewing everyone

349
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,901
for the press thing when there's
only one real option: Me.

350
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:20,598
You wantthis role?

351
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:21,991
Then why weren't you
interviewing

352
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:23,384
with the rest of us?

353
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:25,212
Well, I'm waiting
for them to finish

354
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:27,779
and realize they have no one
so that when they truly need me,

355
00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:29,366
their desperation
will give me the leverage

356
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,131
to get the most out of this.

357
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:33,065
Oh, like get us
out of here? I'm getting my phone back.

358
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,526
You know they not
gonna let you say the truth.

359
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:38,790
How we're being held against our will.
I mean, it's not that bad.

360
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,072
It's not like we're in cages.

361
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:41,315
Not yet.

362
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:43,012
This is my chance

363
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,667
for me to use my superpower:
My media skills.

364
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,582
But use them for what?

365
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,585
Amen. Same
time tomorrow for prayer.

366
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:51,803
And for those who haven't heard,
Brother Hayden's

367
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:54,458
birthday is coming up, and
we'll be having a celebration

368
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:56,939
- in his honor. All are welcome.
- Looks like

369
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,623
the beginnings of a cult to me.

370
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,727
Claudette.

371
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:05,078
Glad I caught
you. I could use

372
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:07,863
your insight
on how to throw a kids' party.

373
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,126
You'd know better than me.

374
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,781
You think that because
I'm a grown woman from my time

375
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:14,348
that that's what I'd know best?

376
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:21,224
I didn't mean to offend her. But you did

377
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:22,530
such a good job at it.

378
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:39,416
Thought I'd find you here.

379
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,462
Did they audition you, too?

380
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,292
Not yet. They're obviously

381
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:47,555
gonna use this press event

382
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:49,078
to screw us over even more.

383
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:53,343
But...

384
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:55,867
something else is on your mind.

385
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:58,696
We need to get out
of this hotel.

386
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,872
And soon. Noah's not
getting the treatment

387
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,222
he needs,

388
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:04,354
not to mention what the guard

389
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,028
did to him the other day.
And if they find out

390
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:07,140
about his voice,

391
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:10,404
about all the... enhancements...

392
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:12,972
I think I...

393
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,280
When I hugged Mariah,
I saw something.

394
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:19,848
I think it was

395
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:22,111
a memory. Her memory.

396
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:27,440
You believe you might
be experiencing

397
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:29,727
an emergent ability

398
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:31,555
akin to Noah? I don't know. I...

399
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:34,428
I wish I wasn't. I don't want
to be afraid to hug her.

400
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:38,171
I believe

401
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:41,174
that with patience and study,

402
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:43,480
we can identify the boundaries

403
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:45,047
of all these abilities.

404
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,354
That may offer you
a sense of control.

405
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:49,356
Yeah, but I'll be no better
at being a mom.

406
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,053
I was so rattled

407
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:54,143
by the vision
and afraid of losing her

408
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:55,840
that I lied to her face.

409
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,061
Well,

410
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:01,498
we're rarely good at something
without practice.

411
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:03,674
We're only human, after all.

412
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:06,503
Go easy on yourself.

413
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:08,984
And when you see her again,

414
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,899
be honest.

415
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:14,076
And if she never wants
to see me?

416
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,643
I don't think that will happen.

417
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:17,601
Your situation is

418
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,690
nontraditional, yes,

419
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:22,432
but there are many ways
to have family.

420
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:26,088
It's what you make
of it that counts.

421
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,228
Hey, you.
Bridge is bringing home Slows

422
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,012
in, like, five, and, uh,

423
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,666
I get to pick
what we stream tonight.

424
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:40,885
Okay.

425
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:43,714
Whoa, whoa. Hold on.

426
00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:46,282
No World War III explosion

427
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:48,154
about "dad movies"?
What's going on?

428
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,332
You said she wrote a letter,
right?

429
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,683
Right.

430
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:57,685
I want to read it.

431
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:59,165
Absolutely not.

432
00:18:00,427 --> 00:18:02,124
It won't help with anything.

433
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:03,604
And I only told you

434
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,041
about it so that you'd stop
making excuses

435
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,391
for her,
thinking she'd come back.

436
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:09,784
And she says she never left,

437
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:11,090
that she was taken. And I

438
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,328
told her she lied
about the letter,

439
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:13,309
but maybe you were, and... Whoa.

440
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:15,311
What do you mean,

441
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:17,435
you told her she was lying?
When did you talk to her?

442
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:19,924
What did you do?

443
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:21,926
I went to see her

444
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,538
last night. You did what?

445
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:26,931
You can ground me later.
Mariah, what were you thinking?

446
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:29,151
I knew you'd never take me,
so I-I took myself.

447
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:31,197
I ca...

448
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:38,029
Well, how'd it go?

449
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:42,251
Honestly, not great.

450
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:44,297
I mean, she was nice.

451
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,299
I didn't know

452
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:48,562
what to call her.
I mean, Bridget is my mom.

453
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:52,261
I just don't know
what to think anymore.

454
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:54,437
I need to read that letter.

455
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:56,178
I need answers.

456
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:01,836
I'm not interested in being

457
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:03,577
your master of ceremonies.
What I need

458
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,795
is medical texts,

459
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,623
contemporary medical training.

460
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,451
Just yesterday,

461
00:19:08,495 --> 00:19:11,237
young Noah notified me
of a medication I was unaware of

462
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,326
that he lacks access to.

463
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,289
I would very much like your help
in acquiring it.

464
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:20,309
Well, I will definitely
work on that.

465
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,073
And on getting Noah the meds
he needs.

466
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:30,604
So?

467
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:33,084
You find anyone we could use
as our spokesperson?

468
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:35,348
Anybody willing
and able? Nope.

469
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:37,785
Myself included.

470
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:39,961
But maybe... And hear me out.

471
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:42,093
Mm-hmm. This whole thing
is a terrible idea.

472
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:53,409
So, who do you have booked
for hair, makeup and wardrobe?

473
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:56,064
Yeah,
this isn't that kind of thing.

474
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:57,500
So, you want us to appear

475
00:19:57,544 --> 00:19:59,285
in front of the press
and the public

476
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:01,722
like the malnourished,
unjustly held detainees we are?

477
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,595
What do you want? I want what you want.

478
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:06,857
Good press.

479
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:08,424
And I have a very particular set

480
00:20:08,468 --> 00:20:10,992
of skills:
Memorization, improvisation

481
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:13,473
and charming... ization.

482
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:15,649
Look, I'll even sign an NDA.

483
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:17,651
It's pretty clear you need me

484
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:19,392
more than I need you.

485
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:21,655
You'll sign an NDA?

486
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:22,917
One demand.

487
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,658
I want my phone back.

488
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:26,288
Your phone? Yeah, you people
confiscated it.

489
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:28,836
It's pink
with a rhinestone case and...

490
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:32,622
Wait, did-did you know
I was coming in here?

491
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,537
What do you mean?

492
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:35,941
My phone.
There it is. Right there.

493
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:40,413
Right where?

494
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:46,070
Look, just get it for me. I can't do that.

495
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:47,985
Well, then, good luck, sis.Wait.

496
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:50,901
I can't, but Jessica can.

497
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:52,686
I'll make the case to her, okay?

498
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:54,949
Best I can ask for
is supervised time once a week.

499
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:56,864
Once a day. Twice a week.

500
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:58,213
Final offer.

501
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:01,042
Deal.

502
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:20,888
So, he stood up,
and I was like, "Oh, my God."

503
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:22,281
Like, wow. I'm so impressed.

504
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,065
And then I stood up,

505
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:26,023
and I forgot
I was wearing my Louboutins,

506
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,547
and I kid you not, no lie,

507
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,418
I was, like,
a foot taller than this man.

508
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:31,246
Like, like, I could fit

509
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,987
one of his Grammys
in between our heads.

510
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,597
Cut!

511
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:39,123
Hi. Excuse me.

512
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:41,822
I know you're working.
I-I just noticed those...

513
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:43,476
those lighting stands and cables

514
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,323
could be tidied up, you know?
Like, someone could trip

515
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,306
and get really hurt, so...

516
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,196
This is my first solo show,
and I really want to avoid

517
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,483
any legal drama.

518
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:51,962
And also for nobody to die.

519
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:54,269
So if we could just...

520
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:57,011
LaDonna, honey, remember,

521
00:21:57,054 --> 00:21:58,447
you're a butterfly.

522
00:21:58,491 --> 00:22:00,231
Don't bother yourself
with the worker bees.

523
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:01,668
Now, come away from the window.

524
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:03,234
You can't afford
to get any darker.

525
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,216
Sharon, are we ready to roll?
We're ready to roll.

526
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,895
Okay, let's get this over with.

527
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:20,295
Can't give a girl
some accessories?

528
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,429
These eyes are not
gonna highlight themselves.

529
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:52,022
Time to be a butterfly.

530
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:56,331
They couldn't vacuum
two days ago?

531
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:59,378
Well, isn't all this just fine

532
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:00,442
and dandy for the cameras.

533
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:02,163
Can you believe LaDonna

534
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:05,296
is working for the enemy?
Oh, let her have this.

535
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,560
She's smarter
than she appears

536
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:09,518
and more current
than the two of us.

537
00:23:09,562 --> 00:23:10,911
Speak for yourself.
I know enough

538
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:12,274
to know when I'm
being bamboozled.

539
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:16,612
Excuse me,
unhand this young man.

540
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:17,874
Can't. Orders.

541
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:19,441
Where exactly
are you taking him?

542
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:20,505
And why don't you take
your hands off him

543
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:21,922
while you think of your answer.

544
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:23,073
They said I have to leave
to get my meds.

545
00:23:23,097 --> 00:23:24,533
That makes no sense.

546
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:26,579
Others have been treated
here, so why is he

547
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:27,773
being singled out? You can take it
up with Agent Tanner.

548
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:29,625
It's her request.

549
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:31,322
Noah.

550
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:34,178
Remember what we discussed.

551
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:35,457
We'll see you soon.

552
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:39,437
They can do anything
they want to us.

553
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:40,830
All in the name of good press.

554
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:42,353
They didn't want the reporters
seeing his face

555
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:44,031
and forcing them to explain it.

556
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:45,728
I should have protected him.

557
00:23:45,772 --> 00:23:47,053
I should have known
not to trust them.

558
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:49,471
This wasn't your fault.

559
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:51,517
We're all doing
the best we can in here

560
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,953
in the face of people
who only want

561
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:55,564
the best for themselves.Mm.

562
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:58,262
And LaDonna's about to do
their job for them.

563
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:00,003
Welcome,

564
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:02,310
everyone. I'm Carla Coleman
from the mayor's office.

565
00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:04,138
To be clear,
we will not be releasing

566
00:24:04,181 --> 00:24:06,532
any personal information
at this time.

567
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:08,272
Our goal is to keep
our residents secure

568
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:09,491
until it is deemed

569
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:11,188
safe for them to rejoin society.

570
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:12,494
Got it?

571
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:14,627
Good. Okay,

572
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,237
let me introduce you
to our resident,

573
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,240
since I'm sure you'd rather hear
from her than me.

574
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:22,548
Hi, everyone.

575
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:24,593
I'll be your hostess, LaDonna.
Please follow me.

576
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:27,596
So, as you can see,

577
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,469
Bois Blanc and the government
know how to treat their guests.

578
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:33,535
Where are the others? Are there recreational
areas? Of course, but the government

579
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,343
has to respect
everybody's privacy.

580
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:36,668
I noticed
a fleet of guards on duty.

581
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:38,172
Aren't
their little outfits cute?

582
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:39,652
I swear,
I feel like Michelle Obama

583
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:41,349
with my own Secret Service.

584
00:24:41,392 --> 00:24:42,916
Things have been very scary

585
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:44,415
and confusing,
but with the government agencies

586
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:45,875
taking care of us, we have felt

587
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,529
safe and-and cared for.

588
00:24:47,573 --> 00:24:49,333
Uh, Tom Ramirez with the
Detroit Express-Ledger.

589
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:50,619
You are LaDonna Landry, right?

590
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:53,927
I-I am. Did you recognize me?

591
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,973
Your mother said that you went
to rehab when you left the set

592
00:24:57,017 --> 00:24:59,585
of your show six years ago.
You look great, like you haven't

593
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:01,214
- aged a day. What's your secret?
- Tom,

594
00:25:01,238 --> 00:25:02,762
you know the answer.

595
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:04,198
It is

596
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:06,200
my amazing 11-step skin care
regimen.

597
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:08,550
Now I'd like you to hear

598
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:10,204
from our social worker,
Jharrel Mateo.

599
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:14,034
Thank you, uh,

600
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:15,644
LaDonna, and...

601
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:18,342
friends, for joining us.

602
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:24,261
Uh, "As a social worker

603
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:25,828
"for the 4,400,

604
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:28,701
"I take great pride

605
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:31,268
"in working alongside
the agencies

606
00:25:31,312 --> 00:25:33,793
to prioritize
our guests' welfare."

607
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,234
Look, this whole thing
is personal to me.

608
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:42,932
My brother is a missing person,

609
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:44,281
so I know

610
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:45,892
how hard it is.

611
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:48,285
And I hope the day
will come soon

612
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:51,724
when we are finally allowed
to inform family members

613
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:54,770
instead of keeping them and
the public at large in the dark

614
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:57,749
about holding these innocent people
against their will. Thank you, Jharrel.

615
00:25:57,773 --> 00:25:59,470
Always sticking up for us.

616
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:00,820
Jharrel, can you expand more?

617
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:02,188
Sorry, Tommy,
but we do have a schedule.

618
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:04,127
So, we're gonna go
to the dining room next.

619
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:05,476
Wait until you see the spread.

620
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,130
We have lobster.

621
00:26:07,174 --> 00:26:08,455
All righty. Right this way.

622
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:10,177
Looks like you won't have

623
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,961
that unstable
partner much longer.

624
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,231
Really, Jharrel?

625
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:24,341
Look, I don't lie for a living,
all right?

626
00:26:24,365 --> 00:26:25,714
Maybe this whole thing

627
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:27,455
is a lot easier for you
than it is for me.

628
00:26:27,498 --> 00:26:29,631
Of course you think
this is about being the hero.

629
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:31,653
You're not the only one
with something to lose here.

630
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:33,113
If this blows back on the mayor,

631
00:26:33,156 --> 00:26:35,028
it is my head. And I'm sorry.

632
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:36,788
All right? I didn't mean
to hurt you or your job.

633
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:38,205
I... Well, you did.

634
00:26:38,248 --> 00:26:39,312
And it still didn't
bring Manny back.

635
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:40,773
I can fix this.

636
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:43,340
You don't know how
to fix anything.

637
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,052
There she is.

638
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:00,531
The woman of the hour.

639
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:01,857
What can I do for you?

640
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:02,969
I'm just here for my phone.

641
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:04,405
I'm sure when people watch,

642
00:27:04,448 --> 00:27:05,687
they're gonna be texting me.
My...

643
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:06,775
My dad's gonna freak.

644
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,715
Look,

645
00:27:09,758 --> 00:27:12,195
I have to stick my neck

646
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:14,154
way out to even get my hands
on it, so... Okay,

647
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:15,372
that's not what we agreed.

648
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:16,696
First of all, the phone is mine.

649
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:18,027
Like, I... Like, I own it.

650
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:19,028
It became government property

651
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:20,421
when you came to Belle Isle.

652
00:27:20,464 --> 00:27:21,901
I didn't come, I was taken. Look,

653
00:27:21,944 --> 00:27:23,337
you did a great job today.

654
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,556
It's gonna help your cause.

655
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,220
Auntie Cha Cha!

656
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:39,135
You made it! Hey, girl. Come here.

657
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:40,963
What are you doing here,
Cha Cha?

658
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:42,965
If I recall, you
weren't invited.

659
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:45,359
Not by you.
But it's not your party, is it?

660
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:47,013
Come give your godmother a hug,
girl.

661
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:48,231
Stay away from her.

662
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:50,625
This is her day, not yours.

663
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,192
I don't like your tone.

664
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:53,691
It's disrespectful. Sharon, what is this?

665
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:55,848
This is trailer gold.

666
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:57,564
Don't worry, if it's good for
the show, it's good for you.

667
00:27:57,588 --> 00:27:58,589
Hon, have a mai tai.

668
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:00,200
Okay?

669
00:28:00,243 --> 00:28:02,768
Uh, B-cam, are you getting this?

670
00:28:04,944 --> 00:28:07,344
You don't talk to me
like that...♪ 'Bout that bass, no treble

671
00:28:12,952 --> 00:28:14,388
We'll try again in a few days.

672
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:16,390
Right.

673
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:23,658
Where are you, bro?

674
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:26,052
I miss you.

675
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:33,712
What the...?

676
00:28:37,454 --> 00:28:39,195
Carla told me where to find you.

677
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:40,544
After your

678
00:28:40,588 --> 00:28:41,850
meltdown about your brother,

679
00:28:41,894 --> 00:28:43,809
she knew you'd be here.

680
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:46,028
So, this is Manny's place, huh?

681
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:47,377
You could've just called.

682
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:48,727
I know.

683
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:53,340
You knew you could get fired

684
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:56,038
if you tanked the press thing.I...

685
00:28:56,082 --> 00:28:58,060
Well, I can't help you
if you don't care. No, I do care.

686
00:28:58,084 --> 00:28:59,781
All right?
That's why I said what I said.

687
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:01,565
Really? Because acting out

688
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:03,306
didn't seem to help
the 4,400 so much

689
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,917
as your own conscience.

690
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:08,834
All right...

691
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:11,358
How did you
keep yourself together

692
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,751
after you lost your sister?

693
00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:17,320
My job.

694
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:19,758
It helped me focus on something

695
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,063
other than myself.

696
00:29:21,107 --> 00:29:23,457
I think I need that. You do.

697
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,807
Look, you want to be there
for them, be there for them.

698
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:27,766
They already went missing once.

699
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,116
It's not fair
they go missing again.

700
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:34,903
Let go.

701
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:39,342
Oh, my God.
Is everything okay?

702
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:40,537
Excuse me, Officer Taylor

703
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:41,867
said we'd have some privacy.

704
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:49,091
The guards seem friendly.

705
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:50,484
You know,

706
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:51,920
we saw the press piece they ran.

707
00:29:53,095 --> 00:29:54,923
It is ridiculous
how the public's

708
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:56,379
already eating this up. Yeah, LaDonna
shouldn't have

709
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:57,839
done that.

710
00:29:57,883 --> 00:30:00,059
Um, hey, listen.

711
00:30:00,102 --> 00:30:01,625
Mariah

712
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:03,497
has something
she'd like to say to you.

713
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,065
I'll leave her to it.

714
00:30:06,108 --> 00:30:08,328
No. Dad, wait. Don't go.

715
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:10,678
Yeah?

716
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,950
"Dear Logan...

717
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:26,563
"I'm so sorry,
but I can't do this.

718
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:29,131
"I tried. I promise I tried,

719
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:31,830
"but I realize I'm not
meant to be a mother.

720
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:34,658
"You and Mariah
deserve better than me.

721
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:36,269
"You have always been my heart,

722
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:37,992
and I know you will be that
for our child."

723
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:40,534
"I meant every vow that I made

724
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:41,840
"to you.

725
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:43,537
"I'm only sorry

726
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,180
"that I'm not strong enough
to keep them.

727
00:30:46,714 --> 00:30:48,324
Shanice."

728
00:30:48,368 --> 00:30:51,110
Mariah.

729
00:30:53,982 --> 00:30:55,288
Logan,

730
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,029
I had no idea
that you would ever read

731
00:30:57,072 --> 00:30:59,118
that letter.

732
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:01,860
That it would stay with you
for 16 years.

733
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,299
I'm so sorry.

734
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:11,870
It was a difficult time,
and I-I was scared.

735
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:14,046
But I'm here now,

736
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:15,284
and I'd like to start from here.

737
00:31:15,308 --> 00:31:16,875
If you'll let me.

738
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:20,139
I really hope you will.

739
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:38,548
Hey, Doc.

740
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:41,769
Brought these medical texts
for you.

741
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:43,423
Oh, my.

742
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:45,120
Thank you.

743
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:47,557
Who is the physician from whom

744
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:48,752
you were able to borrow these?

745
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:50,473
My brother's, Manny.

746
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:52,519
He wasn't a doctor or anything.

747
00:31:52,562 --> 00:31:55,478
More a polymath,
before he went missing.

748
00:31:55,522 --> 00:31:58,742
I'm... very sorry to hear that.

749
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:01,223
Might he be among us 4,400?

750
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:03,008
I had hoped.

751
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:04,463
Thought I saw a green light
out the window the night

752
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:05,943
he went missing
and everything, but...

753
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,100
he's not here.

754
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:09,623
You're sure you want me
to have these?

755
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:12,365
Yeah.

756
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,629
Yeah.

757
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:18,066
It's time.

758
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,851
It's right in here.

759
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:23,158
Um, who are you, again?

760
00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:24,594
Like, am I getting disappeared?

761
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:25,595
'Cause I just wanted
my phone back.

762
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:26,945
Oh, no, no, I'm not Gestapo.

763
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,163
I'm Soraya.

764
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:29,295
I've been trying to get

765
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:30,861
you alone for a couple days now,

766
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:33,995
but you were busy, but then...

767
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:36,606
I found the pilot rough cut
lurking on the deep Internet.

768
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,565
I figured you'd
never seen it and...

769
00:32:38,608 --> 00:32:40,741
Wait, nerd lady, the pilot

770
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:42,743
to That LaDonna Life? Uh-huh.

771
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:44,788
Are you saying
you know who I am? Of course.

772
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:47,008
You're Loretta Landry's
daughter.

773
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:48,749
I have been watching
you since season five

774
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,229
of Real Ex-Wives of Miami.

775
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:52,666
I was so excited

776
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:54,668
for That LaDonna Life
to air, but then

777
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:57,236
you disappeared
and they said you went to rehab.

778
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,020
I always thought

779
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:00,650
that you changed your name
and snuck off to MIT

780
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:03,155
because in season nine,
episode seven of Real-Ex,

781
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:04,518
you mentioned
computer engineering

782
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:07,028
and your 4.6 GPA, but...

783
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,614
turns out that you were
just part of an inexplicable

784
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:10,075
physics-defying phenomenon

785
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:12,686
with 4,399 others.

786
00:33:12,729 --> 00:33:14,775
You're, like,
my very first stan.

787
00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:16,255
Oh. Honor.

788
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:19,562
Check it out.

789
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,699
Ba-bam.

790
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:31,400
Peace.

791
00:33:35,274 --> 00:33:37,580
Not everyone can have this life.

792
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:39,408
But everyone wants it.

793
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:48,069
Auntie Cha Cha, you made it!

794
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:49,331
Baby girl, come here!

795
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:50,680
What are you doing?

796
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,643
I don't like your tone.

797
00:33:56,686 --> 00:33:58,166
It's disrespectful.

798
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,560
And I don't let anyone
disrespect me.

799
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:02,016
No, honey, you disrespected
yourself in that outfit.

800
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,060
What did you say to me?

801
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:04,346
Did I stutter?

802
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,739
Ladonna knows I don't...

803
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:07,523
Mom.

804
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:08,655
What are you doing?

805
00:34:08,698 --> 00:34:10,135
You should be thanking me.

806
00:34:10,178 --> 00:34:11,484
For stealing my show?

807
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:12,789
For giving you one.

808
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,791
You are not enough on your own.

809
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:17,185
Reality TV needs
real-life drama,

810
00:34:17,229 --> 00:34:19,361
and Cha Cha and I bring it.

811
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:21,165
I thought you were smart
enough to know that.

812
00:34:23,887 --> 00:34:26,238
Oh, honey... you're crying.

813
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:31,330
Good, I'll go get the cameras.

814
00:34:31,373 --> 00:34:33,723
You are unbelievable!

815
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,552
Suit yourself.

816
00:34:36,596 --> 00:34:38,989
Cha Cha, take three!

817
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:40,619
No, no, no, no, no, you
don't walk away from me!

818
00:34:40,643 --> 00:34:42,447
You come here, you want
to come crashing parties,

819
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:44,647
you come and talk to me!

820
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:56,050
I asked them to pick these up.

821
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,052
I'll do it myself.

822
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,229
It's my show.

823
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,323
You need to talk
to me first! Hey!

824
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:10,282
You better take your hand

825
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:12,545
off of me. The nerve.

826
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:14,988
Somebody bring me my drink so
I can throw it on this woman...

827
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:26,036
Okay then.

828
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,735
I will bring
the real-life drama.

829
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:40,747
How's this? Right there is excellent.

830
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:45,578
Surprised to see me following
through on my promises?

831
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:47,232
I am.

832
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:49,886
My husband was
a preacher like you.

833
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,192
He did things for show.

834
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:52,367
Or for himself.

835
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:53,673
Well, that's not me.

836
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:54,978
But he sounds like my father.

837
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:58,417
So...

838
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,810
uh, what can I help out with?

839
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:03,378
Well, actually,
we're just finishing up.

840
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:05,250
He should be here...

841
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:07,600
Happy birthday!

842
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:09,297
This is the best we could do.

843
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:12,213
Can't even find
a light anywhere.

844
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:13,780
Oh, I, I can help with that.

845
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:19,351
Look, I get it.
I messed up, but...

846
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:21,701
at least I can
kind of light this candle.

847
00:36:25,357 --> 00:36:27,272
Wow.Ooh.

848
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:32,451
It's a very nice light,
thank you.

849
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:34,844
What're you gonna wish for,
Hayden?

850
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:36,368
I wish...

851
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,328
I wish Noah was here.

852
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:44,767
But... but you all
have made this day

853
00:36:44,811 --> 00:36:47,683
better than it should have been.

854
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:49,250
Thank you.

855
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:50,488
I mean, there's
a lobster with a candle

856
00:36:50,512 --> 00:36:52,166
in its head. Come on.

857
00:37:05,962 --> 00:37:08,400
Yeah, I think that is
the wisest course of action.

858
00:37:08,443 --> 00:37:10,837
Great, thank you.

859
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,274
Bye-bye.

860
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:15,450
That was the mayor's office.

861
00:37:15,494 --> 00:37:18,148
Apparently Jharrel
keeps his job.

862
00:37:18,192 --> 00:37:20,977
They don't want it
to appear retaliatory.

863
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:23,241
I can't say that I'm upset.

864
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:24,653
He shouldn't have said it
when he said it,

865
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:26,287
but he was only saying
the truth.

866
00:37:26,331 --> 00:37:27,897
God, you're defending him?

867
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:30,160
He's my partner. But he's
not your only partner.

868
00:37:30,204 --> 00:37:31,442
Yeah, well,
my other partner reneged

869
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:33,076
on a deal I made with LaDonna.

870
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,402
You couldn't just let her
have some supervised time

871
00:37:34,426 --> 00:37:36,036
with the phone, really?

872
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,299
Do you not understand
the pressure

873
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:39,866
that I'm under
with these people?

874
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:42,608
It would be nice if my partner

875
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:44,740
of six months would be
on my side for once,

876
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:47,221
instead of the colleague
she met last week.

877
00:37:48,657 --> 00:37:49,919
Okay, fine.

878
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:55,316
I'm gonna go back
to my place tonight.

879
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,709
I think we need some time

880
00:37:56,752 --> 00:37:58,406
to cool off. Really?

881
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:05,979
Do you like it?

882
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,417
You made me a chess set.

883
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:25,041
You saw that coming, didn't you?

884
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:29,437
Hey, Millie?

885
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,832
I think I like birthdays now.

886
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,355
Good.

887
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,835
Want to play chess?

888
00:38:44,844 --> 00:38:47,194
So the bad news is I remember
what I was doing

889
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:49,718
the moment the green light
snatched me up.

890
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:51,938
I was falling off a roof...

891
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:53,505
drunk,

892
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,463
shooting my own reality show
and no one

893
00:38:55,507 --> 00:38:57,160
noticed. Oh, my.

894
00:38:58,466 --> 00:39:00,512
And the good? I didn't die?

895
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:03,341
Oh, and what good news
that is, my dear.

896
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:05,865
It would be a mighty loss,
a woman of your intellect.

897
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,999
Literally no one has ever said
that to me before.

898
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:12,045
But you're right, I-I am smart.

899
00:39:12,088 --> 00:39:14,700
About time somebody noticed.

900
00:39:14,743 --> 00:39:18,530
I see your extraordinary worth,
LaDonna.

901
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:20,270
Now...

902
00:39:20,314 --> 00:39:22,621
Jharrel loaned me
medical journals.

903
00:39:22,664 --> 00:39:25,928
And perhaps you
could help me refine

904
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:28,409
my understanding of DNA?

905
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:29,410
Sure.

906
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:31,194
All right.

907
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:32,979
Let's see...

908
00:39:33,022 --> 00:39:34,633
What is this?

909
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:45,165
Okay, I don't know
what it means,

910
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:47,515
but it looks like
some old computer language.

911
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:50,300
My first thought is Cobol, which
no one's used since the '70s.

912
00:39:50,344 --> 00:39:52,433
Well, these books belonged
to Jharrel's brother.

913
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:54,217
He went missing,
too. Jharrel

914
00:39:54,261 --> 00:39:56,132
also mentioned the
presence of a green light,

915
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:58,961
but Manny isn't among the 4,400.

916
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:01,529
It could be nothing.

917
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:04,619
A missing person,
connected even loosely to us,

918
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:07,317
with computer codes
from the past lying around?

919
00:40:07,361 --> 00:40:09,363
Sounds like something.

920
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,279
Could Manny be involved
in our plight some way?

921
00:40:12,322 --> 00:40:13,802
Or this could lead us to him.

922
00:40:13,846 --> 00:40:15,325
Seems worth looking into.

923
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:17,850
We certainly have the time.

924
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:32,342
PR lady?

925
00:40:32,386 --> 00:40:34,736
Hi, Mariah, I'm Ladonna,
one of the 4,400

926
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,435
here with your mother,
and I need your help.

927
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:40,699
I've sent you a video
that I need you to put on blast.

928
00:40:40,742 --> 00:40:42,265
To help Shanice.

929
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:44,224
To help all of us.

930
00:40:44,267 --> 00:40:46,618
Look, I know you're
a bad-ass like your mom.

931
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:48,707
And I know what people
will do for their moms.

932
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,448
So thank you for doing
the right thing.

933
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:56,236
I didn't do anything.

934
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:58,020
I don't know
why this happened to me.

935
00:40:58,064 --> 00:40:59,911
Do you see that? You know what,
I wouldn't eat that.

936
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:02,087
You want to tell me when you
plan on letting us out of here

937
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:04,810
for good? Michigan penal code,
article 328:

938
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:06,855
A person who commits
unlawful imprisonment

939
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:09,728
is guilty of a felony.

940
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:11,556
What?

941
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,316
Why in the world
would you attack him?

942
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,752
He didn't do anything!
Everybody needs to understand

943
00:41:14,776 --> 00:41:16,474
that order will be maintained!

944
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:18,650
You don't make the rules here.
We do.

945
00:41:18,693 --> 00:41:20,608
"Restrain" means
to confine that person

946
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:22,958
so as to interfere
with that person's liberty

947
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:25,352
without lawful authority.
