1
00:00:24,997 --> 00:00:26,585
Help! Help! Help!

2
00:00:26,688 --> 00:00:29,415
It's-it's Rev. He's hurt bad.

3
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,623
What?

4
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:31,521
I went in, and he was...

5
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:33,523
Take me to him. Now.

6
00:00:40,357 --> 00:00:42,601
Wait, he was...
He was right here.

7
00:00:42,704 --> 00:00:44,465
I-I saw him.

8
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:45,776
I-I held him.

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,440
- Don't touch anything.
- I already did.

10
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:49,539
Touch him.

11
00:00:49,677 --> 00:00:53,267
I came in and he was lying
right here on the ground.

12
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:56,684
Your brother is missing, too.

13
00:00:56,822 --> 00:00:58,593
Do you think Manny might
be in danger as well?

14
00:00:58,617 --> 00:01:00,999
I-I don't know. I hope not.

15
00:01:01,137 --> 00:01:03,656
I suggest we work quickly
with what we have.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,486
Now, it seems
the perpetrator was startled.

17
00:01:05,589 --> 00:01:08,869
- Otherwise, why leave the knife?
- Oh, Andre, stop.

18
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:11,492
Everything should be
preserved as evidence.

19
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:20,742
No one should touch
the murder weapon, right?

20
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,504
I got my powers back somehow.

21
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:26,231
Do you think it's because Rev...
Your powers came back?

22
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:30,683
Can you handle things here
while I look for my brother?

23
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:32,061
I got a bad feeling about this.

24
00:01:32,168 --> 00:01:34,377
Okay, just keep
in close contact.

25
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,522
Don't worry, we will get
to the bottom of this.

26
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:46,182
Cover up all the BS.

27
00:01:47,562 --> 00:01:49,195
What the hell are they thinking?
This is private property.

28
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:51,532
Hey! Hey, y'all, stop that!

29
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,916
I should've known.

30
00:01:57,055 --> 00:01:59,574
- Y'all with the 44orum now?
- We're with the right people.

31
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:01,542
Y'all need to leave
before I show you

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,716
exactly what I'm capable of.

33
00:02:05,753 --> 00:02:07,755
You think you can stop
all six of us?

34
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:09,930
Try me.

35
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:39,890
Little something
for your poster freak.

36
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:43,445
Let's get out of here.

37
00:02:57,598 --> 00:02:58,598
All we know is

38
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:00,359
there was blood and no body.

39
00:03:00,497 --> 00:03:03,776
Let's stay calm and
figure out what to do.

40
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,158
She did it.
Is that why you came back,

41
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:07,297
to finish the job?

42
00:03:07,435 --> 00:03:10,162
I was here the whole time.

43
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,820
But you can move things
with your mind.

44
00:03:11,888 --> 00:03:13,452
You wouldn't even need
to be in the same room.

45
00:03:13,476 --> 00:03:17,273
What? Hayden, you know that
I can't do that.

46
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,309
I don't know what
you can do anymore.

47
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:20,310
I should have trusted my vision.

48
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,036
What are you saying?

49
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:24,901
- You think you saw me - kill Rev?
- No.

50
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,919
Just-just you leading people
in here to hurt us.

51
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,009
We all saw what you did
to Bill Greene.

52
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:31,494
That was to save my sister.

53
00:03:31,632 --> 00:03:32,805
It was all for Millicent.

54
00:03:32,943 --> 00:03:35,360
- I'm not a killer.
- Everyone,

55
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:38,949
we are innocent until proven
guilty. And with no body,

56
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,986
we can't even know for
certain what happened.

57
00:03:41,124 --> 00:03:43,230
So let's stop pointing fingers.

58
00:03:43,368 --> 00:03:45,025
Let's get answers.

59
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:49,512
I had really hoped that

60
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,032
coming back here was
the right thing.

61
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,315
I'm sorry, little chicken.

62
00:03:59,418 --> 00:04:01,834
I didn't want to kill you.

63
00:04:01,972 --> 00:04:04,389
I just wish I could
bring him back to life.

64
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:06,080
Like that wouldn't be creepy.

65
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:08,531
Why do we have to
keep eating meat?

66
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:10,429
Have you met Karenna,
who got here last week?

67
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:13,570
She was telling me about
something called veganism.

68
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,848
Millicent, Caleb taught us all
about the importance

69
00:04:15,986 --> 00:04:17,712
of the food chain,
and our place in it.

70
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,404
It's our way of maintaining Zen.

71
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:21,509
Yeah, I just don't know why
we can't bring our Zen

72
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:22,924
to everyone.

73
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,099
Mom dumped us here
when you were eight, Millie.

74
00:04:25,237 --> 00:04:27,757
Don't you wonder what the rest
of the world is like now?

75
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:29,552
This is my world.

76
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,899
And out there is exactly
what Caleb says it is,

77
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:33,728
filled with selfish
irresponsible people,

78
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:35,351
just like Mom.

79
00:04:35,454 --> 00:04:37,663
Not to mention drug addicts

80
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:41,081
and predators and, hello,

81
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:42,703
Charles Manson.

82
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:44,774
Not veganism.

83
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:46,192
We have everything we want here:

84
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:48,364
Safety, education, a future.

85
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:51,332
And out there it's a fight
every day.

86
00:04:52,437 --> 00:04:55,750
They'd probably just
see us as freaks.

87
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:00,755
Okay, I guess I see your point.

88
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:02,757
When Caleb gave you
your community bracelet,

89
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:04,932
you said it with him.

90
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,039
The we is more important
than the me.

91
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,111
And I can't wait to get mine
when I turn 18.

92
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,115
Oh, come on, I'm right.

93
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,818
I knew coming back here
was a bad idea.

94
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:31,196
First thing that goes wrong,
and of course it's my fault.

95
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:33,063
Okay, look, that was bad
down there.

96
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,755
But it's gonna be okay,
all right?

97
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:36,802
Shanice has search parties
spanning out around the building

98
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:37,965
looking for Rev.

99
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:39,287
And we all know
you didn't do it.

100
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:41,658
No, we all don't.

101
00:05:41,796 --> 00:05:43,291
I'm going back to Claudette's,
'cause she trusts me.

102
00:05:43,315 --> 00:05:45,455
No. Mildred, stop!

103
00:05:45,593 --> 00:05:47,319
Look, I know you didn't do it.

104
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:49,977
A 44orumer must have
snuck in here and got Rev.

105
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:51,289
They are our real enemies.

106
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:52,945
I heard they're setting up camp

107
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,083
on a street nearby.

108
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,165
It's like Occupy Wall Street,

109
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,363
but for white supremacists.

110
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:58,882
Look, these are bad people,
Mildred.

111
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,757
I'm just gonna have to
take my chances out there,

112
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:04,198
because if Hayden thinks...
He's just scared.

113
00:06:04,336 --> 00:06:06,649
He told everyone
that I'm a cold-blooded killer.

114
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:08,823
How am I supposed to prove
to everyone that's not

115
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:10,687
- who I actually am?
- Fine.

116
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:12,689
You should talk to
Claudette, but tomorrow.

117
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:14,174
It's not gonna help your case

118
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:16,152
if people see you sneaking
out of here tonight.

119
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,867
Besides, maybe in the morning,

120
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:20,007
we'll know
what the hell happened.

121
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:21,836
Right?

122
00:06:33,503 --> 00:06:35,022
The cops on their way?

123
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,197
I haven't called them yet.
They'll just treat us

124
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:40,683
like suspects when we don't
even know what the crime is.

125
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:44,618
How are you holding up?

126
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:50,175
I keep seeing his body.

127
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:52,281
Lying there, and...

128
00:06:53,316 --> 00:06:55,905
And I came back,
and he was just gone, Shanice.

129
00:06:56,043 --> 00:06:58,183
I-Is this somebody's superpower

130
00:06:58,287 --> 00:06:59,678
or something? I mean,
what the hell is happening?

131
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:01,497
We're all scared. I have teams

132
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,051
scouring the hotel
for any sign of Rev

133
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,984
o-or clues to what happened.

134
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:07,882
- Should I help?
- No, Logan.

135
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,884
You have been through enough.

136
00:07:10,022 --> 00:07:11,610
Hey.

137
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:13,060
Logan, you holding up?

138
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:16,891
Ready to be in my own bed.

139
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:19,963
As the only witness, I'm afraid
I need to ask you to stay.

140
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:22,034
At least until you talk
to the authorities.

141
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:23,553
Let's hang on a minute.

142
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:25,417
He... A crime was
committed, Shanice.

143
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:27,499
We still live - under the
laws of our country. If,

144
00:07:27,523 --> 00:07:30,284
God forbid, the culprit is
a 4,400, imagine what happens.

145
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:32,252
The public
turns further against us.

146
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,288
It might even supersede
our sanctuary

147
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:35,876
and make us all fair game.

148
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:37,912
And besides,
we need to find Rev first.

149
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,536
- No body, no crime.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

150
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,916
There was a body. You have

151
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:43,193
to believe me. I saw him.

152
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,402
Okay, we do, Logan.

153
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:49,372
Okay.

154
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:50,925
We keep it internal.

155
00:07:51,063 --> 00:07:52,479
For one day.

156
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:54,042
I'm still sending
Logan's clothes and the knife

157
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:55,896
- to a friend in the lab.
- Thank you, Keisha.

158
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:59,037
Let's just hope
the killer doesn't strike again.

159
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,930
I wouldn't be surprised
if the 44orum were behind

160
00:08:09,047 --> 00:08:10,462
what happened to Rev last night.

161
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,060
I can't believe they came
to bust the place up.

162
00:08:12,084 --> 00:08:13,431
It breaks my heart to say it,

163
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:15,433
but your Steve
was among the perpetrators.

164
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:17,435
He's not exactly my Steve,

165
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:18,574
but still.

166
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:19,747
First my dad, and now him.

167
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:21,069
Do you...
Do you see what I mean?

168
00:08:21,093 --> 00:08:22,509
They're turning everyone
against us.

169
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:24,925
You really are safer at
the Bois Blanc, dear.

170
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:26,903
Where everyone thinks I'm going
to use my powers to kill them?

171
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:28,342
Now that I have them back,

172
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,344
I just want - to use them for good.
Well,

173
00:08:30,482 --> 00:08:31,966
I'm grateful they've returned.

174
00:08:32,104 --> 00:08:33,599
We're gonna need them
for whatever the 44orum

175
00:08:33,623 --> 00:08:34,486
is planning.

176
00:08:34,624 --> 00:08:35,970
Oh, which reminds me,

177
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:37,800
those children left something.

178
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:40,250
They said it was for you,

179
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,794
but I don't quite
know what it means.

180
00:08:44,013 --> 00:08:45,670
This is Millicent's.

181
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:48,017
- I thought she was at Ypsi Med.
- So did I.

182
00:08:48,155 --> 00:08:49,605
This is even worse.

183
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,158
The 44orum have her.

184
00:08:59,994 --> 00:09:01,341
Let's go get some iguanas.

185
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:05,862
What the hell?

186
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:12,110
Isn't it illegal to take up

187
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:13,939
- an entire city block?
- I guess

188
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:15,907
the cops are giving them a pass.

189
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:17,540
Which is more than we'll get
if we get caught.

190
00:09:17,564 --> 00:09:19,462
There's still
an active tip line, remember?

191
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:23,293
Oh, my God.

192
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:26,020
I shared a van with that psycho.

193
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:27,988
You know, they think
we're iguanas, Mildred.

194
00:09:28,091 --> 00:09:31,509
They want to dissect or kill
or stuff us or whatever.

195
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,492
- That's why we have to find - Millicent and get out of here.
- Okay, look,

196
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:37,135
I'm not gonna let you fly solo,
but I still vote

197
00:09:37,238 --> 00:09:38,526
for Claudette
gathering reinforcements

198
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,827
like she said she could

199
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:41,346
when she saw
how determined you were

200
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:42,530
- to do this.
- I can't wait.

201
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:43,762
If we find trouble,

202
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,556
our powers will
get us out of it.

203
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:46,593
Trust me. But I have

204
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:48,422
to save Millicent.

205
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,838
For real this time.

206
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,152
As we say

207
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:55,774
before each bounty,

208
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:57,880
we give thanks to these animals
for their lives

209
00:09:58,018 --> 00:09:59,433
so that ours may be productive.

210
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:01,090
Everything in symbiosis.

211
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:03,713
Everything Zen.

212
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:05,415
We give thanks to the earth
for giving us life.

213
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,407
I'm starving. Everything

214
00:10:07,545 --> 00:10:10,271
in symbiosis. Everything Zen.
I'm excited to eat, too.

215
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,620
- Give thanks to each other.
- No.

216
00:10:13,758 --> 00:10:16,588
Caleb's not done with his...

217
00:10:16,726 --> 00:10:19,419
Well, someone...

218
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:21,869
has put their needs
above all others.

219
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:26,287
Millicent, would you care

220
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,256
to explain
why you were "outside world"?

221
00:10:30,257 --> 00:10:32,190
She's just hungry, Caleb.

222
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:35,089
It won't happen again.

223
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:37,264
Oh, would that explanation work
for a hit?

224
00:10:37,402 --> 00:10:40,957
Hmm? An insult?

225
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:44,444
Your sister is a senior youth.

226
00:10:45,859 --> 00:10:47,377
An example.

227
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,242
When this happens once,

228
00:10:50,346 --> 00:10:52,624
it's alive in your mind
to happen again.

229
00:10:52,762 --> 00:10:54,833
Her actions

230
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:57,974
water the seeds of selfishness.

231
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:06,224
- I'm sorry, Caleb.
- Don't be sorry.

232
00:11:06,327 --> 00:11:07,950
Be Zen.

233
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:12,955
Take your pulse down.

234
00:11:14,232 --> 00:11:16,234
Take it down.

235
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:21,653
That way, your wants

236
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:25,795
will never take precedence
to the community's needs.

237
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:29,834
Millicent.

238
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:34,666
I'm gonna hold onto this for you

239
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:36,806
until everyone else finishes.

240
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:45,781
Eat.

241
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:50,095
I'm sorry, Millie.

242
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:53,167
I should have stopped you.

243
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,557
Ah. They said I'd find you here.

244
00:12:03,695 --> 00:12:05,835
How's Logan doing?

245
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:09,045
He's asleep, thank God.

246
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:11,047
I was actually
looking for Hayden.

247
00:12:11,185 --> 00:12:14,464
We searched every inch of this
place for any sign of Rev.

248
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,018
Came up empty.

249
00:12:16,156 --> 00:12:18,814
I thought maybe the
vision he mentioned

250
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:21,679
could lead to a clue, but
I can't seem to find him.

251
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:25,165
Well, that's concerning.
Especially as nothing's

252
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:27,374
adding up. I spent
the night with Keisha

253
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:30,342
at the "crime scene,"
as she kept calling it,

254
00:12:30,446 --> 00:12:33,000
trying to parse out the details
of what may have occurred.

255
00:12:33,138 --> 00:12:34,588
If Isaiah's

256
00:12:34,726 --> 00:12:37,384
body was moved,
there should be a blood trail.

257
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:40,456
Instead, there is none.

258
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:44,080
And if the killer is a 4,400
who can make things disappear,

259
00:12:44,218 --> 00:12:45,323
then why leave the knife?

260
00:12:45,426 --> 00:12:47,083
None of it makes sense.

261
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:50,224
And unfortunately,
Logan is our only witness.

262
00:12:50,362 --> 00:12:54,401
Uh, then maybe it's time
to rouse him.

263
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:56,196
I was thinking,
if there could be

264
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:59,302
two witnesses... No, Andre.

265
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,442
This is exactly
why I got rid of my powers.

266
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:04,584
Y-You want me to ask him
to revisit his trauma

267
00:13:04,722 --> 00:13:06,413
so I can experience it, too?

268
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:07,966
No. No, I can't.

269
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:09,416
Well, just like my abilities,

270
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:11,280
we have to accept
the consequence

271
00:13:11,418 --> 00:13:12,418
for their benefits.

272
00:13:12,522 --> 00:13:13,903
If there's anything

273
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,562
to be gleaned
from a review of Logan's memory,

274
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,909
it may catch a killer

275
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:23,050
and let us sleep
better at night.

276
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,405
Miss Claudette.

277
00:13:33,543 --> 00:13:35,580
Was hoping you'd be here.

278
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:38,238
I, uh, heard about the vandals.

279
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:40,965
Look, do you think

280
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:44,416
that has anything to do
with what happened to Rev?

281
00:13:44,554 --> 00:13:46,522
I wouldn't put it past them.

282
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,700
With our former gatekeepers
filling out their ranks,

283
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,939
they now have experts

284
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:51,437
on the geography
of the Bois Blanc.

285
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:53,287
Ken seems ready

286
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:55,117
to do real harm to us.

287
00:13:55,255 --> 00:13:56,843
You have any leads on Manny,

288
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:58,948
either? Jharrel's been
asking about him.

289
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:00,812
Sounded in a state.

290
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,159
I do not envy the challenge

291
00:14:03,297 --> 00:14:05,403
of trying to find
an invisible man.

292
00:14:06,956 --> 00:14:08,924
I-I'm sorry, come again?

293
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,411
Did you not know
about Manny's ability?

294
00:14:13,514 --> 00:14:15,102
No. My partner
conveniently forgot

295
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:17,484
- to tell me - that little detail.
- Do you think that...

296
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:19,417
That Manny
didn't just go missing?

297
00:14:20,418 --> 00:14:21,695
I don't know.

298
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:25,078
I'll see if his brother does.

299
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:40,196
Whatever they're getting
ready for, it is not good.

300
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:43,199
That's why we have to find
Millicent and get back.

301
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,859
Wonder what her power is.

302
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:50,037
When I saw her briefly at
Ypsi Med, I couldn't tell,

303
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:52,268
but they had her in a - hood
and a straitjacket. Millie?

304
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:56,523
Millie!

305
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:01,666
I can't believe it's really you.

306
00:15:01,804 --> 00:15:03,599
- You look so much older.
- I was taken

307
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,222
two years after you. You look
just the same as I remember.

308
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,846
I missed you so much.
Millie, you look so beautiful.

309
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:11,055
- So do you.
- Hey, earth to Millies? We got to go.

310
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:12,988
Right. We've got to go. Now.

311
00:15:13,126 --> 00:15:14,575
Millie,

312
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:15,853
find your Zen.

313
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:17,475
You, too, LaDonna.

314
00:15:19,822 --> 00:15:21,997
Seriously, Millicent,
we need to leave.

315
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,930
- Now.
- But why?

316
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:26,173
We have everything we want here.

317
00:15:26,277 --> 00:15:28,037
Out there,
it's a fight every day.

318
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:29,694
I'd like for you to see that.

319
00:15:29,832 --> 00:15:31,040
I need for you to.

320
00:15:33,077 --> 00:15:34,630
Millie!

321
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,494
Millie! Wait, what's going on?!

322
00:15:36,597 --> 00:15:37,816
- Take them inside.
- Let me go!

323
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,876
What are you doing?!

324
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:40,567
We got a couple iguanas here.

325
00:15:40,705 --> 00:15:43,881
Millie, please! Millie!

326
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:54,236
So, you just h-hold my hands
and read my mind?

327
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:55,962
Sort of.

328
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,413
I can see the memories
of what you're thinking about.

329
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:02,071
- But it's all a blur.
- It's... That's okay, Logan.

330
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:03,245
This isn't a test.

331
00:16:03,383 --> 00:16:05,212
I-I just want to go home.

332
00:16:05,316 --> 00:16:06,869
I-I already lied to Mariah

333
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:08,043
and told her that Hayden

334
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:09,699
wanted me to stay the night.

335
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,080
She's at Mrs. Grover's.

336
00:16:11,218 --> 00:16:13,565
We all want to go back
to our lives.

337
00:16:13,703 --> 00:16:16,258
Whatever that means these days.

338
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:19,054
Okay.

339
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:21,642
So, I-I just...

340
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:30,928
Rev?

341
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:33,723
Rev, can you hear me?

342
00:16:34,724 --> 00:16:36,209
I'm going to go get help.

343
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,257
Did that help?

344
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:54,814
It was just as you said.

345
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,789
I thought I was saving
my sister, not a traitor.

346
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:06,998
I'm sorry for the dramatics.

347
00:17:07,136 --> 00:17:09,483
My bracelet to get you here.

348
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:11,313
The hood.

349
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:13,625
The fact that LaDonna's
in the next room with a gun

350
00:17:13,763 --> 00:17:15,043
to her head if you try anything.

351
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:17,388
You were at Ypsi Med.

352
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:19,183
I saw them take you
down the hall.

353
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:21,047
After I was stolen from Caleb

354
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:22,634
by the green light

355
00:17:22,738 --> 00:17:24,636
two years after you abandoned
his guidance,

356
00:17:24,774 --> 00:17:26,535
I was taken there
almost immediately,

357
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:28,157
where Bill Greene,

358
00:17:28,295 --> 00:17:29,652
who you tried to kill,
offered nothing

359
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:31,022
but reason and kindness.

360
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,852
No, Millie,
you don't understand.

361
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,129
He's a liar.

362
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:35,337
Just like Caleb.

363
00:17:35,475 --> 00:17:37,028
I knew you would say that.

364
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,651
Which is why I brought you here.

365
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:45,071
It's you and your 4,400
who need guidance.

366
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:46,796
You tried to kill a man.

367
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,246
To save you.

368
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:50,628
Does that logic hold?

369
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:53,010
Kill to save?

370
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:55,219
Is that what your reverend
taught you?

371
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:57,255
This isn't you, Millie.

372
00:17:57,393 --> 00:18:00,638
What are you talking about?
You are a 4,400.

373
00:18:00,741 --> 00:18:02,260
You're working with the people

374
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:04,090
who want to get rid of us.

375
00:18:04,228 --> 00:18:05,677
These people

376
00:18:05,781 --> 00:18:07,990
think you're here
to get rid of them, actually.

377
00:18:08,094 --> 00:18:11,097
Which your internationally
televised tantrum confirmed.

378
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:13,168
Millie, your 4,400

379
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:16,688
are a selfish,
irresponsible people.

380
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:18,345
Like Mom.

381
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:21,176
Your Bois Blanc sanctuary

382
00:18:21,314 --> 00:18:22,902
is a cult.

383
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:27,458
You need to be saved.

384
00:18:27,596 --> 00:18:29,909
- You can't be serious.
- Millie...

385
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:32,704
Look at me.

386
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:35,052
We know each other.

387
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,192
We've been there for each other.

388
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:41,196
Even when it seemed
like we weren't.

389
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:45,855
Remember?

390
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:51,447
Yes.

391
00:18:52,793 --> 00:18:55,382
Remember that you are the future.

392
00:18:56,797 --> 00:18:59,455
It's your responsibility
to keep each other safe.

393
00:19:00,456 --> 00:19:03,287
The outside world
intends to inflict harm.

394
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:06,428
It's how they turn you
into one of them.

395
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:08,568
And how do we aim to stay?

396
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:13,780
What's the state of being
that puts the we

397
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:15,402
over the me?

398
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,541
Millicent.

399
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:18,405
Zen.

400
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:19,820
That's right.

401
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,581
We stay Zen,

402
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:23,824
they can't harm us
at any distance.

403
00:19:27,414 --> 00:19:28,760
You're not centered.

404
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:30,072
Your pulse

405
00:19:30,176 --> 00:19:31,453
is on fire.

406
00:19:34,594 --> 00:19:37,114
Now you've destabilized
your sister, too.

407
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:40,910
- Sorry.
- Do you see how quickly

408
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,154
bad energy can spread?

409
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:44,949
That, my children, is how the me

410
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:46,847
destroys the we.

411
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,608
Now,

412
00:19:48,711 --> 00:19:51,128
let's get washed up for chores.

413
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:52,992
And I need to see you later.

414
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:57,582
We have to leave.

415
00:19:57,686 --> 00:19:58,998
What?

416
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:00,965
- We have to leave here.
- I know

417
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:04,520
sometimes Caleb is scary,
but it's for our own good.

418
00:20:04,658 --> 00:20:06,867
- It's for our Zen.
- We should

419
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,938
be able to keep that
in the real world.

420
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,975
Why do we need him
to monitor us?

421
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:14,047
I'm only a few years away from
getting my community bracelet.

422
00:20:14,185 --> 00:20:16,498
Caleb said
that I could start classes soon.

423
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:19,156
I can teach you
the good parts of it myself.

424
00:20:19,294 --> 00:20:21,986
I have the bracelet, remember?

425
00:20:24,885 --> 00:20:27,164
- Come on.
- How?

426
00:20:27,302 --> 00:20:29,338
How could we possibly... There's a bus.

427
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:30,971
It stops at the south side
of the commune.

428
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:32,376
It could take us to Oakland.

429
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:37,208
Please. Mildred.

430
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:39,245
Please. If Caleb

431
00:20:39,383 --> 00:20:42,386
is telling the truth,
then shouldn't we take our Zen

432
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:43,973
to those who really need it?

433
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:50,980
Okay.

434
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,879
If you

435
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:54,650
promise that you're going
to take care of me,

436
00:20:54,674 --> 00:20:57,021
then I'll go with you.

437
00:20:58,022 --> 00:20:59,851
Of course.

438
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:09,378
Shanice? You look shaken.

439
00:21:09,516 --> 00:21:10,862
Are you okay?

440
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,106
I, uh...

441
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:15,522
I thought I'd taken a step

442
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,732
closer to normal.

443
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,528
That I'd hit a rhythm here.

444
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:26,430
Have a chance to understand
this life that I now have,

445
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:28,225
and-and then my powers
came back.

446
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:31,090
And then I had to see...

447
00:21:31,228 --> 00:21:32,850
Isaiah

448
00:21:32,953 --> 00:21:33,953
like that.

449
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:36,888
And... And then...

450
00:21:39,477 --> 00:21:41,755
I think Rev was taken
by a green light.

451
00:21:41,893 --> 00:21:45,242
Like... Like the one
that brought us together?

452
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,520
This is remarkable.

453
00:21:47,623 --> 00:21:48,797
I am terrified, Andre.

454
00:21:48,935 --> 00:21:50,109
What does it mean

455
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:51,696
if they're back?

456
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,871
Maybe it happens in death?

457
00:21:55,321 --> 00:21:58,151
Maybe we were always
meant to go back.

458
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:01,982
So, this can disappear
in a second? Like the lives

459
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:05,641
- we have already lost?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Shanice.

460
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:07,816
The implications are worrisome,

461
00:22:07,954 --> 00:22:10,163
but we don't know anything
for certain now.

462
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:12,476
So, what do we do?

463
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:14,754
I think we keep this between us

464
00:22:14,892 --> 00:22:15,996
for the moment.

465
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:17,653
Our conjecture

466
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,794
could spark further panic
in people already on edge.

467
00:22:20,932 --> 00:22:23,107
What if our perpetrator knew
about the green light?

468
00:22:23,245 --> 00:22:25,144
Or came from one?

469
00:22:25,282 --> 00:22:28,526
And considering
that your powers returned

470
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:30,459
before Rev's body disappeared,

471
00:22:30,597 --> 00:22:32,979
maybe this ZMT

472
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:35,982
that Manny said is in our blood
is somehow related.

473
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,673
His levels dropped.

474
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:39,986
So did his power's efficacy.

475
00:22:40,124 --> 00:22:41,815
Let's submit a request to BHN

476
00:22:41,953 --> 00:22:43,507
for items to aid
in our research.

477
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:46,165
A centrifuge,
a semi-auto analyzer

478
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:48,443
- and as many pipettes - as they'll part with.
- Andre,

479
00:22:48,546 --> 00:22:50,169
what's going to happen?

480
00:22:50,307 --> 00:22:53,413
A question people
have asked for eternity.

481
00:22:53,517 --> 00:22:55,450
Only we...

482
00:22:55,553 --> 00:22:58,280
have the most unique
of circumstance.

483
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,421
And we have each other.

484
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,355
For now.

485
00:23:04,493 --> 00:23:06,495
That we do.

486
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:26,135
I thought I told y'all

487
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,792
not to come round here.

488
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:30,485
Jharrel?

489
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:34,143
What on earth are you doing?

490
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,042
I don't know.

491
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,424
I'm still just trying
to find Manny.

492
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:40,391
Using his code back at him,
hoping he'll

493
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:42,876
return to Room 437,
where I found him with it.

494
00:23:43,014 --> 00:23:46,190
Seems like he doesn't want to be
found again, now, does it?

495
00:23:46,328 --> 00:23:48,019
I know how this looks for him.

496
00:23:48,123 --> 00:23:50,323
I was worried when I heard
everybody's powers came back.

497
00:23:50,401 --> 00:23:52,679
Now Keisha just texted me.
Said she has something

498
00:23:52,783 --> 00:23:55,751
for me to see, and I...

499
00:23:55,889 --> 00:23:57,719
I don't know. I'm
beginning to feel

500
00:23:57,857 --> 00:23:59,341
like I don't know my brother
at all.

501
00:24:01,378 --> 00:24:03,380
I have to tell you something.

502
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:09,109
I saw your brother.

503
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:11,974
Here in 2021
weeks before you did.

504
00:24:12,112 --> 00:24:14,839
He said his name was Jorge,
and he offered to train me.

505
00:24:14,943 --> 00:24:16,531
Wait, what?

506
00:24:16,634 --> 00:24:17,922
When you thought I went away
to bartending school,

507
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:20,120
I was here with him
and other 4,400s

508
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:23,192
learning what we need to know
to be ready.

509
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,918
- To fight back.
- Okay. Wait, wait.

510
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:26,299
I-I don't get it.

511
00:24:26,437 --> 00:24:28,474
Why didn't he tell me this?

512
00:24:28,612 --> 00:24:30,752
- Why didn't you?
- Jharrel,

513
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,824
one of the things
I like most about you

514
00:24:33,962 --> 00:24:36,344
is your heart is on your sleeve.

515
00:24:36,482 --> 00:24:39,362
- I knew you'd never accept - our course of action.
- You trying to justify

516
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,090
- what Manny might have done - to Rev?
- No.

517
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,040
No, there's nothing just
about it.

518
00:24:43,143 --> 00:24:44,800
But sometimes bad things

519
00:24:44,938 --> 00:24:46,561
have to happen
for the greater good.

520
00:24:46,664 --> 00:24:48,735
There's no progress
without pain.

521
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,703
Says the lady
who's learned to deny it.

522
00:24:51,807 --> 00:24:54,465
Maybe Manny will have
a better explanation.I...

523
00:24:55,501 --> 00:24:56,743
Jharrel.

524
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:02,301
There you are.

525
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:04,613
I've been looking all over
for you.

526
00:25:04,751 --> 00:25:07,133
I was worried
you'd also disappeared.

527
00:25:08,962 --> 00:25:10,861
What are you doing down here?

528
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:13,139
I don't think
Mildred's done killing.

529
00:25:13,277 --> 00:25:14,692
First Bill Greene.

530
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,394
Then she shows up here
like nothing happened,

531
00:25:16,418 --> 00:25:17,799
and then Rev dies?

532
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:21,181
I-I think she killed him
to get her power back

533
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,046
and then hid his body
as part of her bigger plan.

534
00:25:24,184 --> 00:25:26,911
- Is this - about the vision you had?
- Yes.

535
00:25:27,015 --> 00:25:29,120
I saw her bringing people

536
00:25:29,258 --> 00:25:31,191
through there. Armed people.

537
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,091
Look, I never wanted
to believe it, but now I do.

538
00:25:34,194 --> 00:25:36,611
- Look, she is - gonna attack us.
- Hayden,

539
00:25:36,714 --> 00:25:40,200
it is hard having visions.
Trust me, I know.

540
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,686
We're stuck interpreting
things we don't understand.

541
00:25:42,824 --> 00:25:44,515
But if we start jumping
to conclusions,

542
00:25:44,653 --> 00:25:47,138
if we start basing what we think

543
00:25:47,242 --> 00:25:49,278
on the narratives
the media is creating,

544
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,626
we become our own enemies.

545
00:25:53,662 --> 00:25:54,870
So, what should I do?

546
00:25:55,008 --> 00:25:57,390
I'm glad you told me
about the vision,

547
00:25:57,528 --> 00:25:59,644
and I'll share it with the
others so we're on the lookout.

548
00:25:59,668 --> 00:26:02,050
But honestly,

549
00:26:02,188 --> 00:26:05,329
I think it would
make Logan really happy

550
00:26:05,467 --> 00:26:07,020
to see a friendly face
right now.

551
00:26:07,158 --> 00:26:08,953
Okay.

552
00:26:09,057 --> 00:26:11,508
Thank you, Shanice.

553
00:26:18,031 --> 00:26:19,516
I can untie you

554
00:26:19,654 --> 00:26:20,689
if you want to eat.

555
00:26:20,827 --> 00:26:22,139
Is it laced with something?

556
00:26:22,242 --> 00:26:23,692
See?

557
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,385
Suspicion drives you.

558
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,560
It's not healthy,

559
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:32,218
Mildred. I only want
what's best for you.

560
00:26:33,564 --> 00:26:35,497
For all the 4,400.

561
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:38,086
Which is what? To kill us all?

562
00:26:38,224 --> 00:26:39,605
It's actually
to protect you all.

563
00:26:39,743 --> 00:26:42,124
Join me, and I can tell you how.

564
00:26:42,262 --> 00:26:45,542
But none of us
want to kill your 4,400.

565
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,717
Really? Is that why
there's a gun to LaDonna's head?

566
00:26:48,855 --> 00:26:50,961
That would be you killing her.

567
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:54,413
- These people have you believing - things not based in reality.
- So,

568
00:26:54,551 --> 00:26:56,725
they're supposed to accept
that we time traveled,

569
00:26:56,863 --> 00:26:58,969
but it's their version
of things that's deluded?

570
00:26:59,107 --> 00:27:00,591
Do you hear yourself?

571
00:27:00,729 --> 00:27:03,525
Your 44orum want us dead,
Millicent.

572
00:27:03,629 --> 00:27:06,183
Nobody has ever said that.

573
00:27:06,286 --> 00:27:07,391
Meanwhile, are you trying

574
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:09,048
to tell me "Embrace Your Power"

575
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:11,637
isn't meant to incite violence?

576
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:12,948
Does that sound Zen to you?

577
00:27:15,572 --> 00:27:18,954
I'm sorry
for what happened back then.

578
00:27:19,092 --> 00:27:20,818
I still can't believe

579
00:27:20,956 --> 00:27:23,062
we're actually
going through with this.

580
00:27:24,097 --> 00:27:26,893
I'm so lucky you're my sister.

581
00:27:27,031 --> 00:27:28,861
In life.

582
00:27:28,964 --> 00:27:30,449
Not just in here.

583
00:27:30,587 --> 00:27:32,934
I hope you keep thinking that.

584
00:27:34,383 --> 00:27:35,902
Why wouldn't I?

585
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,046
You told him?

586
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,738
I had to save us, Millie.

587
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,604
No.

588
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:49,744
We needed to be saved from him.
Millicent.

589
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:52,643
I'm not angry with you.

590
00:27:52,781 --> 00:27:54,507
Much of what we investigate

591
00:27:54,645 --> 00:27:56,267
is making your own mistakes

592
00:27:56,371 --> 00:27:58,649
as long as you're willing
to learn from those mistakes.

593
00:27:58,787 --> 00:28:00,755
Everyone seeks to
run away from that

594
00:28:00,858 --> 00:28:02,273
which asks a lot of them.

595
00:28:02,377 --> 00:28:05,484
That's why selfishness is god
to so many.

596
00:28:05,622 --> 00:28:07,831
I just wanted to see
what the real world is like.

597
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:09,315
That's like saying

598
00:28:09,453 --> 00:28:11,213
you want to know
what it's like to feel sick.

599
00:28:11,317 --> 00:28:12,870
Millie, I love you.

600
00:28:13,008 --> 00:28:15,908
Please, come home with us.

601
00:28:27,126 --> 00:28:28,437
I'm sorry, Caleb.

602
00:28:31,993 --> 00:28:34,513
I'll never be so selfish again.

603
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:43,038
Well done, Millicent.

604
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:45,627
Well done.

605
00:28:47,387 --> 00:28:49,010
Thank you.

606
00:28:49,148 --> 00:28:50,701
For realizing

607
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,841
that this is the right choice.

608
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:56,983
I realized after we went back
that...

609
00:28:57,121 --> 00:28:58,675
I trapped us.

610
00:28:58,813 --> 00:29:00,987
You saved me that day.

611
00:29:01,091 --> 00:29:05,060
I finally found my way
with Caleb's guidance.

612
00:29:05,198 --> 00:29:07,718
And then a year later
I was heartbroken

613
00:29:07,856 --> 00:29:09,736
because I thought
you had been tempted and left.

614
00:29:09,824 --> 00:29:12,654
I thought about leaving once

615
00:29:12,758 --> 00:29:16,382
after I realized
how it actually was with Caleb.

616
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,729
What he did to you.

617
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:21,594
But that's not what happened.

618
00:29:21,732 --> 00:29:23,044
I know what happened.

619
00:29:23,182 --> 00:29:24,908
This happened.

620
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:27,393
Do you think it's a coincidence
I was brought back to you?

621
00:29:27,531 --> 00:29:28,981
Tell me, does your 4,400

622
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:31,017
embrace you, Millie?

623
00:29:31,121 --> 00:29:32,921
Would you say
that your life with them is Zen?

624
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,540
Because I can see in your eyes
that it's not.

625
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:43,582
They haven't been great to me.

626
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,280
Whereas I

627
00:29:52,418 --> 00:29:55,076
have never felt safer.

628
00:29:55,214 --> 00:29:58,044
Despite my designation.

629
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,671
I think you're right.

630
00:30:04,706 --> 00:30:06,777
I can't believe I
didn't see it before.

631
00:30:06,915 --> 00:30:08,607
I'm so sorry, Millicent.

632
00:30:08,745 --> 00:30:10,298
Just...

633
00:30:10,436 --> 00:30:12,887
Just please tell me
how I can help.

634
00:30:20,273 --> 00:30:22,724
- You're lying.
- You can't brainwash me.

635
00:30:22,828 --> 00:30:25,762
No one ever will again.

636
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,556
Wake up, Millicent.

637
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:35,426
Appreciate y'all coming
on such short notice.

638
00:30:35,564 --> 00:30:37,083
And a special...

639
00:30:37,187 --> 00:30:39,845
What's the saying?
Shout-out to Nelson

640
00:30:39,983 --> 00:30:42,264
for bringing us what we need
to save my headstrong friends

641
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,756
who I knew
wouldn't heed my warnings.

642
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,091
Is Jorge coming?

643
00:30:45,195 --> 00:30:47,438
We are in charge of ourselves
for the moment.

644
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:49,268
But remember,

645
00:30:49,371 --> 00:30:51,788
he picked each of us
because we can handle our own.

646
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,140
It's one of those guards you told us

647
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:01,004
to be on the lookout for. Steve.
He alone?

648
00:31:01,142 --> 00:31:02,764
Seems to be.

649
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:09,426
Claudette, I... Get in here.

650
00:31:16,122 --> 00:31:17,122
What's your business?

651
00:31:17,192 --> 00:31:20,333
I, um... I came to apologize.

652
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:21,783
And to warn you.

653
00:31:21,887 --> 00:31:23,474
I swear, in the alley

654
00:31:23,578 --> 00:31:25,314
the other night, I don't know
what I was thinking,

655
00:31:25,338 --> 00:31:27,547
okay? Doing what people did
to my parents' shop.

656
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,006
And your warning?
Ken reported you

657
00:31:29,032 --> 00:31:30,240
to the tip line.

658
00:31:30,378 --> 00:31:31,897
Accused you
of "power threatening"

659
00:31:32,035 --> 00:31:35,003
and assault of
a government-contracted officer.

660
00:31:35,141 --> 00:31:36,461
He's just waiting
on the paperwork

661
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:37,842
to get back to us
and be approved,

662
00:31:37,868 --> 00:31:40,043
and with accusations
this severe,

663
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:41,665
they'll take you
to a black site.

664
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:43,702
At least now they
just come on out and say it.

665
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,152
It's not black like that.
It's... But isn't it, though?

666
00:31:46,256 --> 00:31:49,569
Whether it's the 44orum
that's believing we are iguanas

667
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:52,538
or the government
detaining us as terrorists,

668
00:31:52,676 --> 00:31:56,715
this story ends as poorly
as it always does for us.

669
00:31:56,853 --> 00:31:59,718
For all of us!
Unless we write it.

670
00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:01,823
Now go on back to your brethren.

671
00:32:01,927 --> 00:32:03,376
We could use a man
on the inside.

672
00:32:03,514 --> 00:32:05,931
- I'm sorry.
- Stop being sorry, Steve!

673
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:09,313
And start getting mad
at the right people. Go.

674
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:18,219
Now we have even more reason
to get the hell on out of here.

675
00:32:27,884 --> 00:32:30,265
- Hey.
- Hey.

676
00:32:31,888 --> 00:32:34,304
Ah, to think.

677
00:32:34,442 --> 00:32:37,756
One day ago, we were
the happiest we've been here.

678
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:39,516
And BHN

679
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:41,104
certainly pulled out
all the stops.

680
00:32:41,242 --> 00:32:43,520
And now they're concerned
about 44orum buildup

681
00:32:43,623 --> 00:32:45,453
outside the hotel.

682
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:49,526
Said they're gonna send a rep
to assess our security.

683
00:32:50,561 --> 00:32:53,116
How do I even tell
them what's happened

684
00:32:53,254 --> 00:32:54,600
in the building?

685
00:32:54,738 --> 00:32:56,636
Not that I'm even sure.

686
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:58,949
Which is why I need to continue
my research.

687
00:32:59,087 --> 00:33:00,744
When you spoke
to our benefactors,

688
00:33:00,882 --> 00:33:02,781
did they mention my request?

689
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:08,890
If they declined my appeal,
I can take it.

690
00:33:08,994 --> 00:33:10,927
No, Andre.

691
00:33:12,894 --> 00:33:15,759
They actually want
to meet in person.

692
00:33:15,897 --> 00:33:18,727
Outside the Bois Blanc.

693
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,729
Which is why I didn't
want to tell you.

694
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:23,802
I can't have you go
out there, Andre.

695
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,459
- They're not wrong - about the 44orum.
- I will be careful.

696
00:33:26,597 --> 00:33:28,151
A field medic knows

697
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:29,635
how to navigate
hostile territory.

698
00:33:29,773 --> 00:33:32,672
But who's to say BHN
isn't also the enemy?

699
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,191
Or maybe
we're so cynical already

700
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:35,582
that we're passing up
a golden opportunity

701
00:33:35,606 --> 00:33:37,160
to help ourselves.

702
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:39,472
- We have to trust - someone eventually.
- I don't agree.

703
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,750
I only trust who I know.

704
00:33:43,545 --> 00:33:46,307
I don't want you to put yourself
in harm's way, Andre.

705
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:51,001
You know
I can take care of myself.

706
00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:53,762
And I want to go.

707
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,316
For you.

708
00:33:55,454 --> 00:33:57,490
For everyone.

709
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:03,911
Open up, Claudette!
This is your last chance!

710
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,503
You're in here somewhere.

711
00:34:10,641 --> 00:34:12,851
Not a lot of places to hide.

712
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,958
Hey.

713
00:34:18,995 --> 00:34:20,962
I hope you're presentable.

714
00:34:35,218 --> 00:34:37,358
Did you hear that?

715
00:34:37,496 --> 00:34:39,843
Yeah. I'm-I'm scared, Mildred.

716
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:41,224
I'm so sorry, LaDonna.

717
00:34:41,362 --> 00:34:42,822
I thought that I knew
what I was doing.

718
00:34:42,846 --> 00:34:44,227
I thought that I knew my sister.

719
00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:46,160
Like I thought I knew my dad.

720
00:34:48,196 --> 00:34:49,404
You're safe now.

721
00:34:49,542 --> 00:34:50,647
Proud of yourselves?

722
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:53,177
Did you guys take out
an entire street?

723
00:34:53,201 --> 00:34:54,616
Place was practically
a ghost town.

724
00:34:54,754 --> 00:34:56,146
We only had to subdue
a few of them.

725
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,723
One of them tried to poke me
with this.

726
00:34:57,861 --> 00:34:59,552
Those boys and their
Confederate toys

727
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,875
that make them
feel like patriots

728
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:02,279
when really they
act like traitors.

729
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:04,419
That's a light cavalry saber
used at Antietam.

730
00:35:04,557 --> 00:35:05,672
You one
of those Civil War buffs?

731
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:07,664
No, I... I was there.

732
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:12,541
All right, y'all can do
your little meet-adorable

733
00:35:12,565 --> 00:35:14,429
or whatever later.
We have to get out of here.

734
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:15,751
The 44orum is on the offensive

735
00:35:15,775 --> 00:35:17,191
planning something big.

736
00:35:17,294 --> 00:35:18,685
Mildred, let's get your sister
and hightail it.

737
00:35:18,709 --> 00:35:19,949
No, wait, it's not that simple.

738
00:35:20,056 --> 00:35:21,656
- She's one of them.
- I beg your pardon?

739
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:23,852
Millicent lured me here
and tried to convert me.

740
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,544
They have one of us
on their side?

741
00:35:25,647 --> 00:35:27,727
- Do we know what her power is?
- She didn't tell me.

742
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:29,513
Then we have even less time
to waste. We have

743
00:35:29,582 --> 00:35:30,982
to get back to the bar
to get ready.

744
00:35:34,898 --> 00:35:36,969
Take it you haven't heard

745
00:35:37,107 --> 00:35:40,110
- from your brother?
- Despite leaving the ciphers, no.

746
00:35:40,248 --> 00:35:41,767
Look, I'm worried about him,
Keisha.

747
00:35:41,905 --> 00:35:44,770
You should be.
But for everyone else's sake.

748
00:35:45,909 --> 00:35:47,059
He thought he left
a pristine crime scene,

749
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,325
but he forgot one thing.

750
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:49,740
And once the Feds find out

751
00:35:49,878 --> 00:35:51,570
they're looking
for an invisible man,

752
00:35:51,673 --> 00:35:54,607
you can be damn sure DARPA's
got the technology to catch him.

753
00:35:54,745 --> 00:35:56,644
Just wait. Please, Keisha.

754
00:35:56,782 --> 00:35:59,140
- Manny must have a good reason for why he's doing this.
- His reasons

755
00:35:59,164 --> 00:36:01,407
are purely selfish, Jharrel.
As are yours

756
00:36:01,511 --> 00:36:02,995
for trying to protect him.

757
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:05,411
Just thought you should know
what's coming.

758
00:36:05,515 --> 00:36:07,413
I'm gonna need
whatever's in that bag.

759
00:36:11,728 --> 00:36:13,523
What the hell, Jha?

760
00:36:13,661 --> 00:36:16,595
- Oh, so, this is you - testing me now?
- No, bro.

761
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:18,286
This is us catching a killer.

762
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,087
We were counting
on you eavesdropping

763
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:27,789
on our investigation. Keisha
said that you would show up

764
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:29,413
if you thought
you were gonna get caught.

765
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,750
I was really hoping
you wouldn't.

766
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:33,577
Now talk.
Or we will literally drag you

767
00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:35,338
to the police station.

768
00:36:35,476 --> 00:36:37,823
- Let me tell you why.
- Why what?

769
00:36:37,961 --> 00:36:39,583
Why I killed that reverend.

770
00:36:39,687 --> 00:36:41,516
Oh, my God. You did do it.

771
00:36:41,654 --> 00:36:43,001
With what's coming, the 4,400

772
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:44,939
cannot have somebody
taking away their powers.

773
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,452
Turning special people

774
00:36:46,556 --> 00:36:47,740
into the ones
that are trying to oppress them.

775
00:36:47,764 --> 00:36:49,490
- So you stabbed him?
- I heard

776
00:36:49,628 --> 00:36:51,295
he tried and failed to give
Mildred Bell her powers back,

777
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:52,919
so something more drastic
was called for.

778
00:36:55,116 --> 00:36:56,635
You may not believe me,

779
00:36:56,738 --> 00:36:58,844
but I'll carry this with me
the rest of my days.

780
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,296
It was still
the right thing to do.

781
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:05,126
- And what did you do - with the body?
- What? Nothing.

782
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,311
Once I disappeared again,
I got the hell out of there.

783
00:37:07,335 --> 00:37:09,348
So that's why you killed him?
Just to get your powers back?

784
00:37:09,372 --> 00:37:12,202
With what's coming,
I needed to make sure

785
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,067
all the 4,400
were fully charged.

786
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:17,311
Okay. So,

787
00:37:17,414 --> 00:37:19,323
- what's the plan?
- You lead the team into the hotel.

788
00:37:19,347 --> 00:37:20,831
Be at the ready.

789
00:37:20,969 --> 00:37:22,557
LaDonna,
can you illusion us both

790
00:37:22,695 --> 00:37:23,707
so we can get close
to Millicent?

791
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:24,801
Probably easier

792
00:37:24,904 --> 00:37:26,147
than a mess of iguanas.

793
00:37:26,251 --> 00:37:27,700
We appreciate
you towing the mark.

794
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:29,495
This would all be so different

795
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,256
if I'd just listened
to her back then.

796
00:37:31,394 --> 00:37:33,223
But as soon
as I finally understood,

797
00:37:33,361 --> 00:37:34,983
she was a true believer.

798
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:37,917
And I got zapped
before I could save her.

799
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:41,162
This is my chance
to do the right thing.

800
00:37:41,266 --> 00:37:43,233
This is not your fault, Mildred.

801
00:37:43,371 --> 00:37:45,718
We can't change the past,

802
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,824
but our future
isn't written yet.

803
00:37:47,927 --> 00:37:49,412
The 4,400 in that hotel

804
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,390
need you with them
whether they know it or not.

805
00:37:51,414 --> 00:37:53,933
They are your family now,

806
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:55,590
and you have to protect them

807
00:37:55,728 --> 00:37:57,730
while we do the same.

808
00:37:57,868 --> 00:37:58,938
All right?

809
00:37:59,939 --> 00:38:02,183
Y'all be safe.

810
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,946
None of you know the Bois Blanc
like I do,

811
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:08,914
so stay close behind me.

812
00:38:12,193 --> 00:38:13,574
Let's go.

813
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,800
So, you really expect us
to believe

814
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:21,720
that you did this
for the good of the 4,400?

815
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:23,308
I just want the 4,400
and both of you

816
00:38:23,446 --> 00:38:24,766
to be prepared
for the inevitable.

817
00:38:24,861 --> 00:38:26,104
Oh, yeah? And what's that?

818
00:38:26,242 --> 00:38:27,726
Your trial
for first-degree murder?

819
00:38:27,864 --> 00:38:29,279
Check the 44orum.

820
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:30,970
Tell me what you see.

821
00:38:36,631 --> 00:38:38,668
It's time to save
you God-fearing patriots

822
00:38:38,806 --> 00:38:40,542
from these threats...
This is outside the hotel.

823
00:38:40,566 --> 00:38:42,292
To our way of life.

824
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,880
Your families will never be safe

825
00:38:43,983 --> 00:38:45,399
if we allow these freaks to make

826
00:38:45,502 --> 00:38:47,263
our inner cities
even more dangerous.

827
00:38:47,401 --> 00:38:49,230
I have to warn everyone.

828
00:38:49,334 --> 00:38:51,577
And let them know
that we caught you.

829
00:38:53,234 --> 00:38:54,753
Hey. Please,

830
00:38:54,856 --> 00:38:56,075
tell me you are not one
of the 44orum.

831
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:57,135
I'm not, bro. I swear.

832
00:38:57,273 --> 00:38:58,422
Okay, then what the hell, Manny?

833
00:38:58,446 --> 00:38:59,896
How do you know what you know?

834
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:01,553
You're not ready to hear it.

835
00:39:02,588 --> 00:39:04,590
You know, Claudette
said the same thing to me.

836
00:39:04,694 --> 00:39:06,972
Because apparently,
you are her mentor.

837
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,310
- Well, she's a quick study.
- This isn't a game, Manny!

838
00:39:09,354 --> 00:39:12,495
She is out there thinking
that she is indestructible

839
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:14,290
because of her powers and you.

840
00:39:14,428 --> 00:39:16,671
I care about Claudette.

841
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:19,433
Not about what she can do
for me. About her.

842
00:39:19,536 --> 00:39:21,676
So if you know anything

843
00:39:21,814 --> 00:39:23,126
about what's happening,

844
00:39:23,264 --> 00:39:24,817
you better tell me now.

845
00:39:29,097 --> 00:39:31,514
Come with me to the window.

846
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:43,767
Here we go. 44 no more!

847
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:55,538
Get in, Dr. Davis.

848
00:39:56,884 --> 00:40:00,370
There won't be another chance
to get the answers you seek.

849
00:40:11,485 --> 00:40:12,969
It's getting loud out there.

850
00:40:13,072 --> 00:40:14,315
I know.

851
00:40:14,419 --> 00:40:15,637
That's why I'm glad
Keisha has a suspect.

852
00:40:15,661 --> 00:40:17,353
I can go home
and get us to safety.

853
00:40:17,491 --> 00:40:19,769
Look, honestly, Mr.
Kaminski, I can stay.

854
00:40:19,907 --> 00:40:21,160
That's out of the question,
Hayden.

855
00:40:21,184 --> 00:40:22,772
Mariah's at Mrs. Grover's.

856
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:25,326
That's where I'm taking us
until all this can blow over.

857
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,304
- Come on.
- Then you seriously need to get a move on.

858
00:40:27,328 --> 00:40:29,054
The mob is growing
by the second.

859
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:30,687
Are you sure it's even safe
for you both to leave?

860
00:40:30,711 --> 00:40:32,333
We've got to try, Shanice.

861
00:40:32,437 --> 00:40:35,060
- Is anyone watching the tunnel?
- Right now,

862
00:40:35,198 --> 00:40:36,579
let me get you to safety.

863
00:40:36,717 --> 00:40:38,650
Do it! Do it! Do it!

864
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:49,592
So, this is all you somehow?

865
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:53,423
You know as well as I do that
this is just America in 2021.

866
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:56,633
What I've done is to make sure
we all get the right outcome.

867
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:59,257
- For once.
- What the hell

868
00:40:59,395 --> 00:41:01,259
does that mean, Manny?

869
00:41:02,536 --> 00:41:04,054
I didn't come here
from a year ago.

870
00:41:04,192 --> 00:41:06,194
Stop lying to me,

871
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:08,680
Manny. All right?
I saw the green light.

872
00:41:08,783 --> 00:41:10,129
True, Jha.

873
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:12,925
But it didn't take me to 2021.

874
00:41:13,063 --> 00:41:15,790
It took me to 2062.

875
00:41:15,928 --> 00:41:19,138
And I'm here from the future
to make things right.
