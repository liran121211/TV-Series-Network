1
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:07,572
Well, it's actually.

2
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:09,835
Jharrel's apartment. I see.

3
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:11,988
And I suppose technically
it's his brother's. But the way

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,057
I'm finna look at it now
is it's my place,

5
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:16,407
- my space, my taste.
- Uh-huh.

6
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:18,975
Oh, uh, someone's at the door.
I better go.

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,716
Oh, Mrs. Grover,
please don't forget

8
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:22,346
about those newspaper clippings
you promised me.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,067
Of course, dear.
I'll see you soon.

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,680
Jharrel.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,205
Uh, come in.

12
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:33,337
Thanks. Hey,

13
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:35,209
I just...

14
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:37,950
Yo.

15
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:41,998
You really resuscitated
the place.

16
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:45,709
Feels like I'm
in the land of the living again.

17
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:48,396
To what do I owe this honor?

18
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,050
Well, I wanted

19
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:51,703
to, you know, check in.

20
00:00:51,747 --> 00:00:53,227
See how you were doing.

21
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,751
I thought you're not
my case worker anymore.

22
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:57,753
That you're assigned to work

23
00:00:57,796 --> 00:00:59,929
with the 4,400
coming into the hotel.

24
00:00:59,972 --> 00:01:02,125
Although I'm not sure why
in Lord's name they'd want to

25
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:03,672
since we've been granted
our freedom.

26
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:05,761
Yeah, I guess they all

27
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:07,502
want to drink the Kool-Aid
Rev is serving.

28
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:10,157
You know they're
coming because of him.

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,116
And you came here for me?

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,857
What?

31
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:17,947
O-Oh, um, yeah.

32
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,123
No, I was just
in the neighborhood

33
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:23,779
and, um, you know, kind of
drove here automatically.

34
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:26,042
Habit.

35
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:28,740
Well, since you're here,

36
00:01:28,784 --> 00:01:31,395
allow me to give you a tour
of my new digs.

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,616
Starting with my darkroom.

38
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:42,754
I'm taking up photography again.

39
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:45,975
Starting with all the
historic sites of Motor City.

40
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:49,109
So, I've been thinking.

41
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:51,850
Um, I refuse

42
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:55,115
to live only on this government
stipend like I did my husband.

43
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:57,682
Never know when the rug's gonna
get pulled out from under you.

44
00:01:57,726 --> 00:01:59,423
Okay, hold up.

45
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,556
Did you say you want a J-O-B?

46
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:06,561
You know, I might actually be
able to help you out with that.

47
00:02:07,518 --> 00:02:08,519
I got a guy.

48
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:10,042
Oh, you got a guy?

49
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:12,175
Do you now, Jimmy Hoffa?

50
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:19,008
Explain to me

51
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:21,924
how you thought it was okay
to allow my daughter

52
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:23,839
to be a getaway driver.

53
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:26,798
A getaway driver,
Andre! And then

54
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:28,322
fail to mention
that funny little fact

55
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:30,062
when you saw me.

56
00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:33,196
You're sweating bullets.

57
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,155
Oh, best not get too close.

58
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:38,070
Indeed, I believe I am unwell.

59
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:41,335
- Well, let me get some help.
- No. Please.

60
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:43,530
I cannot risk being dragged off
to that dreadful institution.

61
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:45,469
In fact, I've not felt well

62
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:47,428
since I returned from Ypsi Med.

63
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:49,473
I'm sure it will pass.

64
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:52,215
Oh, my God, Andre.

65
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:53,608
You're in your pajamas.

66
00:02:54,565 --> 00:02:57,177
Ew! Are you okay?

67
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,353
I'll be fine. I just need
a little rest is all.

68
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:00,895
Okay, cool, 'cause I
need to talk to you

69
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,245
about the files we
took from Ypsi Med.

70
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:02,965
I'm trying to figure
out how to read them,

71
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:04,184
and then you can

72
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:05,837
do your doctor-y
thing and figure out

73
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,119
- what the hell is - wrong with us.
- Okay,

74
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:08,100
you two,

75
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:09,363
to be continued.

76
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:11,103
And after I pick up some soup

77
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:13,889
and get you some electrolytes,
you and I are to be continued.

78
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:15,282
Thrilling.

79
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:17,022
Get back into that bed.

80
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:27,598
The U.S. government
will provide the 4,400

81
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:29,731
who stay at the Bois Blanc Hotel.

82
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:32,037
Meals. A stipend.

83
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,517
Free transportation.

84
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:34,605
- Clothes.
- Clothes?

85
00:03:36,477 --> 00:03:38,522
What's the catch, Keisha? Mm.

86
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:39,523
Your guess is as good as mine.

87
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:41,003
All I know is

88
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:42,831
the government is
letting the 4,400 stay

89
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:44,330
at the Bois Blanc, but only
if they sign these contracts.

90
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:46,008
So, we give away our firstborn?

91
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:48,880
Well, you do, Shanice. Look,
this still might be better

92
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:50,597
than whatever my mom has planned
for me if I go back with her.

93
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:51,883
You're going home?

94
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:52,928
Who knows.

95
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:54,122
I can barely stand that woman

96
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:55,341
for more than one take,
let alone

97
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:56,932
- indefinitely.
- Look, I-I don't know

98
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:58,673
what's up with this contract.

99
00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:01,415
What I do know is the government
hasn't said one word to us

100
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,981
since y'all heisted Ypsi Med.

101
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:04,244
- That's weird.
- Sus.

102
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:05,419
That's what we say nowadays,

103
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:06,420
lady from the aughts.

104
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:07,464
Y'all.

105
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:09,466
Right.

106
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,902
I'm gonna
go through the contract

107
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:12,600
and comb through the fine print.

108
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:15,994
On this thing, I guess?

109
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:19,041
- Don't even start.
- I did not say a word.

110
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:20,453
Look, you do you, boo.
I need to figure out

111
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:22,131
how to read these files
from Ypsi Med

112
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:25,047
on a very, very nongovernmental
computer. And you?

113
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,831
I've got to get to work.

114
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,399
Okay. Well, wonder triplets
unite or whatever.

115
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:33,795
It's-it's, like, what people
are doing nowadays, so just...

116
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:34,859
- No, they're not.
- No, they're not.

117
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:36,101
Okay. That is totally fine.

118
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:37,755
You guys are very vanilla.
Goodbye.

119
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,235
She's a mess.

120
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,281
Thank you.

121
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,414
Yeah.

122
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,374
No, sure. I got it.

123
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:48,549
I got it.

124
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:58,994
Okay, from the looks of it,
this doesn't seem that bad.

125
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:01,344
To the untrained eye, sure.
But we both have

126
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,228
very trained eyes
on how this government works,

127
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:04,869
which you and I
both know is sus.

128
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:06,480
Damn.

129
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:09,178
Soft on the 4,400.
Hard on the bosses.

130
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:11,833
Where did you lose your way?
Jharrel, shut up.

131
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:14,575
Wait, hold on.

132
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:16,359
Why are those people
being rushed?

133
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:18,970
Yeah,
that's the contracts booth.

134
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:20,494
Something's not right.

135
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:22,017
Yeah, I'll check in

136
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,410
with Shanice on what she found.

137
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:24,996
And tonight I'm having
dinner with Jessica.

138
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,543
Try and see what she knows.

139
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:28,110
A date with Jessica?

140
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:29,677
You better bring a sweater.

141
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,418
Boy, worry about
your own love life.

142
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:35,117
That's right, you don't got one.

143
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:40,035
Jharrel really
sang your praises.

144
00:05:40,078 --> 00:05:42,167
How smart you are.

145
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:45,257
So, look, I know that barback
isn't the most glamorous...

146
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:47,651
Oh, I don't need glamour, sir.
Just a solid way to earn.

147
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:48,826
Barney.

148
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,089
This is Claudette.

149
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,787
Hi.

150
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:55,398
Nice to meet you.

151
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:59,446
See you around, newbie.

152
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:05,495
All right. Let's
get you started.

153
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:30,346
Forget it. Let's go.

154
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,348
Can I help you, ladies?

155
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,176
Can you get the Hulk's
attention over here?

156
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:36,091
Probably not.

157
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:38,398
Can you make us gin and tonics?

158
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:44,316
Y'all ever try a gin and sin?

159
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,029
Those cowards in hoods

160
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:03,684
bomb a church with our women,
our children

161
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:05,990
inside. What's next?

162
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:07,992
Jimmy will know what to do.

163
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:09,970
What a blessing that you
have a God-fearing husband

164
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:12,910
fighting for us,
organizing our sit-ins

165
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:14,477
- and such.
- Yes, truly blessed.

166
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:16,131
We sure do a lot of sitting.

167
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:17,741
Fighting, not so much.

168
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:19,961
- Good Lord, here she goes.
- Maybe it's time to fight.

169
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:23,007
- Fire with fire.
- Like Brother Malcolm. - I hear you,

170
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:24,851
Barb, I do. Maybe
just lower your voice a tad?

171
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,271
You took the photos, Claudette.

172
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:28,032
- Barb, shush.
- You saw the horrors up close.

173
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:29,773
- When you got back, - you were a mess.
- Barbara, lower

174
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:32,103
- your damn voice.
And with your photographs,

175
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:34,018
if you showed folks
the terror, the truth,

176
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:36,281
truth no set of eyes could deny,

177
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:38,153
they might be ready
to fight, too.

178
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:42,157
Everything all right over here?

179
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,202
- Just fine.
- Oh, peachy.

180
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:47,162
All right now, Jimmy?

181
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:07,574
Sir, help, please. I...

182
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:09,532
I need to find the ice machine

183
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:12,317
as I'm burning up.

184
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:13,884
Thought you were a doctor.

185
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:17,192
Can't you heal yourself?

186
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:24,547
Oh, dear God.

187
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:32,381
Oh, no.

188
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:43,087
How are they
supposed to understand this?

189
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:48,528
Andre? I thought you were sick.

190
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:49,790
I know you're cross with me,

191
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,273
but I don't know
who else to turn to.

192
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:54,708
Okay, Andre, you're scaring me.

193
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,451
I believe I possess a power.

194
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:01,105
Albeit a deadly one.

195
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:02,324
What?

196
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,760
Oh, my God.

197
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:05,283
Poor Tim.

198
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:07,938
Tim? The-the jerk guard

199
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:09,461
who took Hayden's chess set?

200
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:10,854
I touched him.

201
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:13,770
I held on to him for support,

202
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:15,214
and the poor fellow's
bones snapped.

203
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,470
I heard them break.
Then he lost his balance

204
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:20,429
and took a terrible tumble
down the staircase.

205
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:22,823
Oh, my God. Is-is he...?

206
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:24,433
Alive, yes.

207
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:26,609
Thank God.

208
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:29,830
This...
This all began at Ypsi Med.

209
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:31,745
I thought at first
I might be imagining it

210
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:33,790
amidst the adrenaline
and the chaos,

211
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:36,619
but now I think I actually...

212
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:38,795
healed the guard there.

213
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,102
Now, here's where

214
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:42,538
it seems
even more inconceivable.

215
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,148
Ever since then,

216
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,497
I have felt violently ill.

217
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,456
Until I broke Tim's bones.

218
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:49,153
Shanice,

219
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:51,678
a transference of sorts
must have taken place.

220
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:53,636
Okay.

221
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,638
You heal a person,

222
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:59,033
and then you ingest
some type of pain?

223
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:01,557
And the only way
to get rid of it

224
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,821
is to-to give it
to another person.

225
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:14,744
I took an oath to heal,

226
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:16,616
not harm.

227
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,098
I cannot risk hurting you.

228
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:25,189
We simply do not know the scope
of this power.

229
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,681
Hey. Sorry, - I didn't mean to scare you.

230
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:41,858
Um, I was
just waiting here because...

231
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:45,079
It's just that I...
Oh, my God. Words, LaDonna.

232
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:47,255
Spit it out.

233
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:49,953
I was just maybe hoping you
could help me out with a thing.

234
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:53,174
I already helped you, remember?

235
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:55,239
- Didn't turn out - so well for me.
- Yeah, I know, it...

236
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:57,787
It got, like, super emo.
But this is different.

237
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:03,358
I need help building
a computer from scratch.

238
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:04,881
That way,
there's absolutely no way

239
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:06,380
for the government
to access the files, okay?

240
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:07,623
No Internet, no Wi-Fi.

241
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,905
So the government
can't track it,

242
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:10,844
which keeps us both clean.

243
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:13,063
Look, I promise once
this ghost computer's built,

244
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:14,630
you're done.

245
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,155
We have to figure out
what we are

246
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:19,983
and what the hell
happened to us.

247
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:28,731
If you burn me,
you are dead to me.

248
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:31,081
- Again.
- Le duh.

249
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:35,520
You kind of had
me at "build a computer."

250
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:38,219
Oh, no, I am that geek.

251
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,751
This-this is the
moral of the story.

252
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,797
Do not listen to this man.

253
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,450
Cheers to that.

254
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:53,843
Claudette?

255
00:11:58,152 --> 00:11:59,457
You know, our buddy Tim

256
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,329
is practically in a body cast.

257
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:03,635
Seems like one of you
did something to him

258
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,550
at the hotel.

259
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:12,557
- Wait, she didn't let you in.
- On her little secret. Bro,

260
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:14,144
- she's just trying to work.
Wait a minute.

261
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:16,213
You-You're one of them?

262
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:18,868
A 4,400?

263
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:26,615
Some are saying that your kind

264
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:29,009
might not even be human.

265
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:33,578
Let's go.

266
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,581
Yeah.

267
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:48,768
Going on break.

268
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:55,687
Congratulations,

269
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:57,820
Miss Independent!

270
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:01,781
Child. Get over here.

271
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:04,696
Oh, Mrs. G.

272
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:09,179
What is the matter?

273
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:11,225
I was a fool
to think I'd be allowed

274
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:12,661
to stand on my own two feet.

275
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:15,272
The date's changed, but...

276
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:18,188
some things stayed
exactly how they were.

277
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:28,590
Lord have mercy.

278
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:31,941
They gonna be ready
for the pamphlets?

279
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,640
Children died.

280
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:39,470
- What's next?
- As of today,

281
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:41,318
we got over a hundred folks
coming to the sit-in.

282
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:43,866
Not for the movement. For us.

283
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,434
When are they gonna stop
killing us?

284
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:48,194
I mean, they the damn ones
that brought us here

285
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:50,699
- only to hunt us for sport.
- Claudette, calm yourself.

286
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:52,135
I know you're upset...

287
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:53,896
We have tried the sit-ins
and the pamphlets.

288
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,052
When are we gonna go after them?

289
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:57,793
Our approach has been working,

290
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,927
and we will not stoop to
their level of depravity.

291
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,059
Trust me, woman, when I say

292
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:04,800
to you if we did,

293
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,890
things could get worse for us.

294
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,936
- What is worse - than this, James?
- Enough!

295
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:18,509
I let you do more
than you should.

296
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:24,080
More than what most husbands
let their wives do.

297
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:26,082
You should be grateful.

298
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:27,779
Now...

299
00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:31,087
keep on taking your pictures

300
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:33,698
and leave the leading to me.

301
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:36,005
We clear?

302
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,795
Are we clear?

303
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,493
Yes, Jimmy.

304
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,718
So, will we finally be graced
with That LaDonna Life

305
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:55,024
if you leave the Bois Blanc?

306
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:57,809
I think I'm done
with reality TV.

307
00:14:57,853 --> 00:15:01,291
But, like, all of a sudden,
my mom's inviting me home,

308
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:04,207
so who knows what that woman has
up her lipo garment sleeve.

309
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:06,949
I'd much rather go to my dad's.

310
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:09,343
Okay. Well, is that an option?

311
00:15:09,386 --> 00:15:11,084
Not really.

312
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:12,868
I've tried
to get in contact with him,

313
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,175
but his number is unlisted.

314
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:17,351
Which I get. Like,
my mother literally cast him

315
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:18,961
as a villain on the show, so...

316
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:20,789
Oh, yeah. I remember.

317
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:22,356
She made him seem
like such a monster.

318
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,444
Well, he's not.

319
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:35,935
He was, like, the only person
to really get me, you know?

320
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:42,202
I used to be such a daddy's girl
before they split.

321
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:45,379
And then after he became
public enemy number one,

322
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:47,163
I couldn't see him as much.

323
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:49,078
My mom said
it wasn't a good look

324
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:52,386
for the show or whatever.

325
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:55,563
Oh, that's awful.

326
00:15:55,606 --> 00:15:57,217
I'm sorry.

327
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,523
'Tis life.

328
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:03,092
But I can't stay here forever.

329
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:04,746
Oh, it's been really cool,

330
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:06,922
you know, like, learning to code

331
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,228
and using my brain and stuff,

332
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:10,752
but I do have a life back home.

333
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:12,884
My actual friends.

334
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:14,974
- Your friends from the show?
- Mm-hmm.

335
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,298
Girl, if those are your friends,

336
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:19,282
I would hate to
know your enemies.

337
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:21,458
They're not that bad.

338
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:25,027
They aren't. All right.

339
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:28,378
Saying goodbye to true friends
like you've made here?

340
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:31,033
I... You have told them,

341
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:34,689
- right?
- Okay, true friends? Like...

342
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:35,951
I've known these people

343
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,258
for, like,
half a season of television.

344
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,086
And no.

345
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:44,090
But it's my life.
They don't need to know.

346
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:45,787
Oh, honey.

347
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,442
You don't know
how to have friends.

348
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,751
It can be hard saying
goodbye to people.

349
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:56,928
Even if you've only known
the 4,400 for a short while.

350
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:00,628
Trauma bonds people.

351
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,195
Okay, that's not
what's happening here.

352
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:05,328
Okay? I'm too fabulous
for trauma.

353
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:10,029
Look, I just need to finish
this computer for them.

354
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:12,727
Besides that, nothing's
keeping me here, right?

355
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:21,997
Hey.

356
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,564
Ji-Eun, right?

357
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:25,827
Sorry,
I'm just checking up on folks.

358
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,959
Making sure you all got
what you need.

359
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:30,745
I noticed you
at the contracts booth.

360
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:32,747
You were asking for something.

361
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,446
A printout for my records.

362
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,014
The guy promised he would get it
by the end of the day.

363
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,103
- And still no copy?
- It's okay.

364
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:43,758
- I don't want to cause - any problems.
- No, hey, what problems?

365
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:44,909
It's your right to see them.

366
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:46,761
This man harassing you?

367
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,636
Just, uh, catching up
with one of your flock, Rev.

368
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,073
If that's allowed.

369
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,726
Ji-Eun,
remember what I told you.

370
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,989
If you need anything at all...

371
00:17:58,033 --> 00:17:59,556
We have you.

372
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,732
Sure do. You ready
for prayer service?

373
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,953
Yeah.

374
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:12,134
I brought you what you
asked about the other day.

375
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:13,744
- The clippings?
- Mm-hmm.

376
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,579
Look at my girl.

377
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,234
"She went on

378
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:27,628
"to become a leader in
the Black Panther organization,

379
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:29,891
"believing,
'We stood by too many years,

380
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:32,720
"'hands behind our backs
to give them peace.

381
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:34,243
But we learned...'"

382
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,378
"'...only revolution

383
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:40,902
will guarantee the peace
Black folk deserve.'"

384
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:42,208
You know

385
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:43,383
what has changed?

386
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:45,211
In today's movement,

387
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:48,388
women's voices
are not only heard but followed.

388
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:50,912
Not as much as they should be,

389
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:53,349
but certainly more
than in your time.

390
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:55,003
I wonder what Barb

391
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:57,005
- would think of Barney.
- Yeah, Barb knew

392
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:58,591
there were a lot of Barneys
rotting this country

393
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:00,245
- from the inside out.
- What do you think

394
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:03,446
Barb would do if she knew
how high up the ladder

395
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,361
today's Barneys have climbed?

396
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:08,103
Sitting all high and mighty
in such powerful positions.

397
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,107
All right, listen up. Hey.

398
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,980
I have seen the photos of our
sisters and brothers up close.

399
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:17,199
Which is why

400
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:18,635
we are coming to
their front steps.

401
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:19,767
Yes! That's right.

402
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,160
We will bring our message

403
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:22,283
to the Klan's headquarters.

404
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:25,207
And sit like we always do?

405
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:29,603
Little sitting ducks
just waiting to be killed.

406
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:33,520
What if we make this personal
and strike

407
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:35,957
at the heart of the monster?

408
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,350
The Grand Wizard's house.

409
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:38,457
- Claudette.
- Yes, Claudette.

410
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:39,787
All right, dear.

411
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:42,181
That's enough.

412
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,356
Let her finish, Jimmy.

413
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:51,407
I'm not talking no sit-in.

414
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:53,279
We bomb

415
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:54,802
that white devil's house.

416
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:56,630
And nobody has to be there.

417
00:19:56,673 --> 00:19:58,240
Nobody has to get hurt.

418
00:19:58,284 --> 00:20:01,200
But we show him and his family

419
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:02,766
what it feels like
to be terrorized

420
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,507
and what we are capable of.

421
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:06,030
Attagirl. Yes!

422
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:07,771
It ain't a half bad idea.

423
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:09,773
Other organizations
have been striking back.

424
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:11,471
- Exactly.
- Yes.

425
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:12,839
- Heard there's been some success.
- There has.

426
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:14,474
There has, Jimmy.

427
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:18,304
Y'all have to excuse
my passionate wife

428
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:19,653
talking out of turn.

429
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:21,307
Brothers,

430
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,831
you know we can't
fight fire with fire.

431
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:26,050
We must oblige
to what our Lord asks.

432
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:30,490
Matthew 5:38-40.

433
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:33,014
"But I tell you,

434
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:35,930
"do not resist an evil person.

435
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:38,976
"If anyone slaps you
on the right cheek,

436
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,109
turn to them
the other cheek, also."

437
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,731
Look what the cat dragged in.

438
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:56,994
Oh, I've been meaning to
ask y'all something.

439
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:58,082
Claudette,

440
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,345
we need your help.

441
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:01,453
What's going on? I believe

442
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:03,000
my power has finally emerged.

443
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:05,220
Does this have anything to do

444
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,266
with what happened
with that guard at the hotel?

445
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,658
Yes, it does.

446
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:09,940
It won't take more than a minute

447
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:12,183
but will be immensely helpful.

448
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:13,707
Cut me.

449
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,578
Uh, me?

450
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:32,639
Oh, hell, give it here.

451
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:37,208
Not too deep.

452
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:40,951
Now what?

453
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:48,959
Oh, the discomfort.
Almost immediately

454
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:51,048
this time.

455
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:02,669
I feel better now.

456
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:09,240
Lord have mercy.

457
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:11,417
Miss Claudette,

458
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,070
thank you so very much.

459
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:14,570
Please, if there's anything
I can do for you...

460
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:16,117
You both can help me.

461
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,946
What I was gonna ask

462
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:22,689
any interest in a drink
on the house tomorrow night?

463
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:37,791
Okay, Jess, I know
I owe you an apology

464
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:39,270
for flaking the other night,

465
00:22:39,314 --> 00:22:41,229
but I got called
into an emergency

466
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:43,057
- for the 4,400.
- I'm just sorry

467
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,426
you have to work so closely
with them.

468
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,539
I mean, they are dangerous.

469
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:50,673
Right?

470
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:54,547
You know,
a lot of them are real cool.

471
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,375
Nice folks.

472
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:59,813
I don't really know
that they're dangerous.

473
00:22:59,856 --> 00:23:01,162
Are you serious?

474
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:02,685
Because I do.

475
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:05,601
I know firsthand,
up close and personal.

476
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:07,777
Well, when you throw
human beings in a cage

477
00:23:07,821 --> 00:23:10,911
like they're animals,
they're gonna act like one.

478
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:12,521
Are they human?

479
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:15,698
I mean, 'cause their blood work
says otherwise.

480
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:18,422
- And, uh, oh, yeah, they - traveled through time.
- Wait, blood work?

481
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:21,617
You never mentioned anything
about that.

482
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:25,186
I barely see you.

483
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:28,581
Why would I?

484
00:23:28,624 --> 00:23:31,148
- That's classified.
- Well, I think it's kind of important

485
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:33,542
for me to know what y'all
are planning on doing with them.

486
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:36,371
So, does this
blood work revelation

487
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,894
have anything to do

488
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:40,244
with these new extensive
contracts they have to sign

489
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,376
just to stay in the hotel?

490
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,464
So,

491
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:44,727
this is what this is?

492
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:48,557
Wow, Keisha.
You, uh, feed me, pump me

493
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:50,124
for information. Jess, no.

494
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,952
It's not how it seems.

495
00:23:51,995 --> 00:23:54,128
I think it's exactly
how it seems.

496
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:56,696
I am

497
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:59,089
drowning, Keisha.

498
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:00,569
And I was

499
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:02,441
really hoping
that you could be the one person

500
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:03,616
that I could count on.

501
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:08,142
But you being a real,
actual, supportive partner?

502
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:11,145
I mean, who was I
kidding? I may not know

503
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:13,228
who you are anymore,
but at least you're consistent.

504
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:20,284
You're not gonna fight.

505
00:24:20,328 --> 00:24:22,896
And you're not gonna fight
for me.

506
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:30,294
I'm done.

507
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,112
So, they all your kind?

508
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:12,423
You all right there, big guy?
Uh...

509
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:14,164
You're looking a little pale.

510
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,471
Like you could use some water.

511
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,607
Oh, but maybe not
this one, though,

512
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:25,219
with my dirty 4,400 fingers
all over the glass and all.

513
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:28,483
Yoo-hoo, can I get
some help over here?

514
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,007
Can I get a Moscow mule?

515
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:35,055
Make that two Moscow mules.

516
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:37,710
And a menu? Excuse me.

517
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:39,146
All right, hey, hey, that's it!

518
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:41,583
All you freaks

519
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:42,907
need to get the hell
out of here.

520
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:45,021
I have the right
to refuse service

521
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:46,109
to anyone.

522
00:25:46,153 --> 00:25:48,851
Nope. That belongs to me.

523
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:53,595
And I have the right to
fire those who don't fit

524
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,684
the culture of my establishment,

525
00:25:55,728 --> 00:25:57,120
which includes bigots.

526
00:25:58,513 --> 00:25:59,906
So grab your crap and get out.

527
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,474
These freaks aren't even human.

528
00:26:03,518 --> 00:26:06,303
And what do you know
about being human?

529
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:16,531
All I know is
there's a whole lot more

530
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,881
who see you all

531
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:20,840
the same way I do.

532
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:38,074
I would like to propose a toast.

533
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:40,990
To Miss Claudette and the feat
she so skillfully pulled off.

534
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:42,252
Here, here.

535
00:26:42,296 --> 00:26:43,993
Yes. That was, like,
really empowering.

536
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:46,909
And thank you for ridding
this place of that gross,

537
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:47,823
hateful dude.

538
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:49,303
Seriously.

539
00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:51,740
One less fearmonger
for us all to deal with.

540
00:26:51,784 --> 00:26:53,307
If only he was the last one.

541
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,656
And to a fresh start.

542
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,658
The future is your oyster.

543
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:58,878
What may we expect next?

544
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:00,706
How about a promotion?

545
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:04,057
I'm short a bartender,
and word is,

546
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,820
- you're not as green - as you look.
- Really?

547
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,106
Yes. Absolutely.

548
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,813
Is this y'all's "to be
continued" about to continue?

549
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:23,250
'Cause there's definitely
a vibe happening here that...

550
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:27,602
that doesn't include me,
so I'm-a go...

551
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,821
elsewhere.

552
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,043
Thank you for your help.

553
00:27:35,044 --> 00:27:36,655
I am unsure

554
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:39,701
what a future with this power
looks like, but...

555
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:41,877
I am certain if I have you
by my side,

556
00:27:41,921 --> 00:27:43,879
then I will accept any fate.

557
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:45,751
Or...

558
00:27:45,794 --> 00:27:48,449
am I foolish to hope for such?

559
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:51,060
I can't answer that, Andre,

560
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:53,367
until we figure some things out.

561
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:06,815
Thank you for being here.

562
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:08,512
Thank you for inviting me.

563
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:11,428
And seeing me as,
like, deep enough

564
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:12,952
to want to be a part of it.

565
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:20,960
This was the most important
I've ever felt.

566
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:23,919
Being a part of something
with purpose.

567
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:27,183
Yeah.

568
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:28,750
You all right?

569
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:32,406
Yeah, yeah.

570
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:35,801
Just figuring it all out,
you know?

571
00:28:35,844 --> 00:28:38,238
I do.

572
00:28:42,024 --> 00:28:45,288
You want to come over next
week for a girls' night?

573
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:47,769
I got to practice making all
these $20 two-sip concoctions

574
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:50,729
2021 folks are so willing
to pay for.

575
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:55,821
You know what? Yes.

576
00:28:55,864 --> 00:28:58,171
A thousand percent yes.

577
00:28:58,214 --> 00:29:00,477
Yes to you
and-and the girls' night

578
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:02,175
and dranks
and us having a purpose.

579
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:03,785
I'm gonna stay.

580
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:04,960
You sure you're okay?

581
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:06,875
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right.

582
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:08,616
I'll dial you next week.

583
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:10,705
Okay, texting is more
what we do, but yes.

584
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:24,719
Hello?

585
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:30,594
Daddy?

586
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,779
You have no idea.

587
00:29:42,345 --> 00:29:44,826
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

588
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,001
Whiskey neat.

589
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:47,524
How'd you know?

590
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:49,352
I notice things.

591
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:52,051
Like how you trace the rim of
your glass when you're thinking.

592
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:53,835
Okay, uh,

593
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:55,881
I am not weird, I promise.

594
00:29:55,924 --> 00:29:57,883
Look, I'm trying to say.

595
00:29:57,926 --> 00:30:00,973
I-I notice things
because I'm-I'm interested.

596
00:30:02,191 --> 00:30:03,889
In you.

597
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:10,025
Yeah, suffice to say,
I'm not girlfriend material.

598
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:12,375
Mine broke up with me
last night.

599
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:13,855
- You cheat?
- Nope.

600
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:16,292
I was just a cold bitch.
Not sure which is worse.

601
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:19,252
Mm. Cheater's always
gonna cheat.

602
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:26,346
A cold bitch just needs
something or someone

603
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:28,827
worth melting the ice for.

604
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:37,096
Look at you,

605
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:39,881
being our very own Tom Cruise
in Cocktail.

606
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:41,709
Tom who?

607
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:44,930
Only the biggest movie star
of our time.

608
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:48,803
Key word being "time."
Never mind.

609
00:30:51,023 --> 00:30:54,635
I, um, I got you something.

610
00:30:57,638 --> 00:30:58,987
What's this for?

611
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:00,486
Look, it's nothing fancy,
it's just...

612
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,295
a little something
for your first job

613
00:31:02,338 --> 00:31:03,513
in 2021.

614
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:04,906
Uh, maybe

615
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,604
save opening it
for the end of the night.

616
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:15,699
- Can I pour you a drink?
- Sure.

617
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:17,745
- I'll be your guinea pig.
- Please.

618
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:19,244
I've been pouring men's drinks
for longer

619
00:31:19,268 --> 00:31:20,617
than I care to remember.

620
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:22,663
Least now I'm getting paid
for it.

621
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:41,029
Thank you, for all this.

622
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:43,466
You're the one who did it,
Claudette.

623
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,860
You made all this happen.

624
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,383
Don't forget that.

625
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:57,263
Thank you for walking me back.

626
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:58,655
May I?

627
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,793
Shanice, I... Listen...

628
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:07,664
No... Truly, you...

629
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,492
Andre.

630
00:32:09,536 --> 00:32:10,798
Talk.

631
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:17,544
I am deeply apologetic for not
telling you about Mariah.

632
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:21,069
I'm unsure what
I was thinking, or...

633
00:32:22,505 --> 00:32:25,987
I was not using my faculties
at all.

634
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:29,817
All I know is I didn't want
to upset you.

635
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:34,213
Thank you.

636
00:32:34,256 --> 00:32:36,258
That's all I wanted to hear.

637
00:32:36,302 --> 00:32:37,607
An apology

638
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:40,523
with sincerity
and without a "but"

639
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:42,221
to negate it all.

640
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:50,533
Is this the reason you've been
acting strange around me?

641
00:32:50,577 --> 00:32:52,883
Or does it have to
do with me saying.

642
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:55,016
Logan's name in my sleep?

643
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:02,981
I guess apologizing on behalf
of my subconscious mind

644
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,460
doesn't make sense.

645
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:08,116
I am sorry, though,

646
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,336
that you had to hear.

647
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:11,859
Truly.

648
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:18,997
An apology is unnecessary,
because I don't care.

649
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,563
You don't care?

650
00:33:20,607 --> 00:33:22,609
Why, not at all.

651
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:30,182
Then what are we doing?

652
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:32,358
Because I care, Andre.

653
00:33:32,401 --> 00:33:36,362
Of course I care,
I just don't care care,

654
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:39,321
because not caring is not what
I intended to communicate.

655
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:40,757
English, please.

656
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:41,758
I am speaking English.

657
00:33:41,802 --> 00:33:43,064
Not jibber-jabber.

658
00:33:43,108 --> 00:33:45,632
You know what I mean.

659
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:48,678
I don't know how to speak
like you.

660
00:33:48,722 --> 00:33:50,071
I don't know
how to act like you,

661
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:53,074
I don't know how to be
with you, here,

662
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:54,356
in this time,
where men and women

663
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,034
love multiple people
simultaneously

664
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:57,557
and ex-lovers are friends,

665
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,515
and while that is
lovely and wonderful,

666
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:01,039
it's also supposed
to be so normal,

667
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:06,392
because today everything
is so nonchalant.

668
00:34:06,435 --> 00:34:08,307
I'm trying to be just
as laissez-faire

669
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,745
so I don't scare
you away, but...

670
00:34:11,788 --> 00:34:15,749
perhaps I don't belong in 2021.

671
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:18,186
Because I don't
want to share you,

672
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,710
not even in your
subconscious mind.

673
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,236
Because I care.

674
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,121
You do care.

675
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:43,777
And I do, too.

676
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:20,814
Lord have mercy, you scared me.

677
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:22,946
I am so sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you at all.

678
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,907
I just, no, I came because
I didn't want you to be alone.

679
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,171
Not like that.

680
00:35:30,215 --> 00:35:32,608
I mean, with everything
that went down tonight,

681
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:34,697
and... with Barney.

682
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:36,661
And I know you're all
independent and everything,

683
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:38,310
now that...

684
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:51,453
Oh. Okay.

685
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:55,718
Oh. Sorry.

686
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,594
Oh, w-w-wait. Watch this.

687
00:36:06,555 --> 00:36:09,341
I know, right?
Smart and romantic.

688
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:18,654
And how much
have you had to drink?

689
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:21,570
Oh, not enough to not consent.

690
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:23,703
Because I consent.

691
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:25,357
Do you?

692
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,316
Okay. Uh...

693
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,927
I don't do the rebound thing.

694
00:36:30,971 --> 00:36:32,712
This needs to be real
if you want more.

695
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,107
Or we can...

696
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:41,503
talk about it tomorrow.

697
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:48,641
LaDonna?

698
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:55,561
She's gone?

699
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:03,351
"Push here."

700
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:15,842
Hey, so I know how scary

701
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:19,454
computers are to you and that
you can barely even send a text.

702
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:21,606
Well, actually, you cannot,
because one time we tried that,

703
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,806
and you sent a bunch
of commas to yourself.

704
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,896
So, anyways, um, because
you are a hundred years old,

705
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,769
I'm going to speak
very slow and clearly

706
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:31,727
about how to get
the files from Ypsi Med.

707
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:33,903
And I know you might
be feeling anxious

708
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:35,296
and want to eat your feelings,

709
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,298
so I did leave you
my favorite snack.

710
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:38,691
You're welcome.

711
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:40,823
Um, but seriously, Andre,
if at any time

712
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:43,565
this feels, like,
too beep-boop-boppy for you,

713
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:45,045
reach out to Soraya.

714
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,526
She's on our side. Okay, bye.

715
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:52,008
I'm just kidding. Um...

716
00:37:52,052 --> 00:37:54,707
I mean, this is goodbye.

717
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,841
Um, and I'm...
I'm sorry it sucks, but...

718
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:02,802
this would've been way too hard
to do in person, so...

719
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:06,849
Uh, but at least
I will have these.

720
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,376
That's a good one.

721
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:28,131
Hey.

722
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:29,437
So, what'd you figure out?

723
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:33,354
Okay, this "contract" is a trap.

724
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:34,573
It's not so much a contract

725
00:38:34,616 --> 00:38:36,314
as it is laying the groundwork

726
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:38,707
for the government to put people
under conservatorship.

727
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:40,796
Wait, what? But
that robs the 4,400

728
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,146
of their rights, financial
decision-making...

729
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,061
- Their freedom.
- And it's all legal.

730
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:46,411
But why would Rev encourage

731
00:38:46,454 --> 00:38:47,760
so many people
to sign a document

732
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:49,370
that's gonna be so restrictive?

733
00:38:49,414 --> 00:38:51,067
Brothers and sisters,
before we begin,

734
00:38:51,111 --> 00:38:55,289
I'd like to thank you
for a smooth last couple days.

735
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,727
Brother Bill Greene and I
rely on your trust

736
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:01,861
as we do everything... Yeah, the
most important question right now

737
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:04,167
is how many of them
have signed this?

738
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:21,489
What's wrong?

739
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:24,449
Did something happen
to one of our members?

740
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:25,667
They're fine.

741
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:29,541
Everyone's fine.

742
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:31,499
Who I'm worried about is you.

743
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:33,762
Heavens, why? I'm good.

744
00:39:33,806 --> 00:39:35,547
I don't know if that is true,

745
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,158
given your recent outbursts.

746
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:40,465
I find them
rather alarming, dear.

747
00:39:40,508 --> 00:39:42,399
I don't understand. I-I haven't
done nothing but offer you

748
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:44,382
and our members
something different to try.

749
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:47,428
There are places that specialize
in helping women like yourself...

750
00:39:47,472 --> 00:39:51,084
Women with divergent
thinking... get back on track.

751
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:52,999
Jimmy, I-I don't need
no help thinking. I...

752
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:54,348
It will only be a few months.

753
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,630
Months? Where in Lord's name...

754
00:39:55,654 --> 00:39:58,439
Provided you be a good woman,

755
00:39:58,483 --> 00:40:01,964
shouldn't take too long
to get you right as rain.

756
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:05,054
Jimmy, I-I don't need
none of that.

757
00:40:12,888 --> 00:40:16,022
I'm sorry
for what I said. I-I...

758
00:40:16,065 --> 00:40:18,590
For speaking out of turn.
It was a mistake.

759
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,681
I-I'll do whatever
you tell me to do.

760
00:40:22,724 --> 00:40:26,206
I-I promise I won't say
nothing anymore.

761
00:40:26,249 --> 00:40:28,774
I won't say a word.
I-I won't say a word.

762
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:33,996
Jimmy, please don't this to me.

763
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,825
But you made me do it, dear.

764
00:40:38,827 --> 00:40:39,785
Jimmy.

765
00:40:39,828 --> 00:40:41,264
Jimmy, please.

766
00:40:43,092 --> 00:40:45,399
Jimmy.

767
00:40:49,316 --> 00:40:51,318
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

768
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:07,247
Open the door, Claudette.

769
00:41:09,423 --> 00:41:11,860
Claudette, open this door.
