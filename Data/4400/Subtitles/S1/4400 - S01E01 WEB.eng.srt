1
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:13,056
Shanice, it's time to wake up.

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,145
Are we in Paris?

3
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:17,191
Yeah.

4
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:19,976
I just picked up
some croissants for breakfast.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,239
Fresh ones.

6
00:00:22,283 --> 00:00:24,676
And are we gonna stroll
by the Seine later

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,723
and make out on a
bridge at sunset?

8
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:29,551
Definitely.

9
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,728
Liar.

10
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:36,862
Not about - the making out part.

11
00:00:47,786 --> 00:00:50,267
Okay. All right, Mariah.

12
00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:54,663
Hi.

13
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:56,143
You are gonna be
in so much trouble

14
00:00:56,186 --> 00:00:58,145
if you didn't bring her
a croissant.

15
00:00:58,188 --> 00:01:00,669
Don't you have somewhere to be?

16
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:02,671
Yes.

17
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:06,240
Yes, it's a bad look for me
to be late on my first day back.

18
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:07,197
Especially when

19
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:08,764
Mr. Zimmer
has it out for me.

20
00:01:08,807 --> 00:01:11,071
Oh, no. No, you've kept up

21
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:12,439
with everything
during maternity leave.

22
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:14,422
You're gonna be back
and better than ever.

23
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:15,945
- Right?
- That's right.

24
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:17,816
Just got to face
the day in front of me.

25
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:29,263
That's perfect.

26
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:30,438
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

27
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:31,743
All right.

28
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:38,228
- Ah. BlackBerry.
- There you go.

29
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:42,493
- All right.
- Come on.

30
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:44,582
- I got you.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:46,976
Have a nice day.

32
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,283
- Okay. I love you.
- I love you. Mwah.

33
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:51,372
Bye.

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,378
If you ready to move.

35
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:15,309
What is this?

36
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:17,049
I don't know, but it won't stop.

37
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,367
Pardon me!

38
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:33,631
What in heaven's name?

39
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:35,155
What is this?

40
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:36,504
Where am I?

41
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:38,027
I-I think...

42
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,724
I think it's Belle Isle?

43
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:41,596
Is that... Is
that in Brooklyn?

44
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,293
No. Detroit.

45
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:47,732
I-I'm a physician.

46
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,256
I should...

47
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:50,953
Wait.

48
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:54,174
Sirens? An air raid?

49
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:55,914
I...

50
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:27,729
Keisha Taylor.

51
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,470
Are you social work
or corrections?

52
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:30,775
I'm a parole officer.

53
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,492
Can someone tell me
what all this is about?

54
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:34,102
You'll be briefed
and assigned a facility.

55
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:35,626
Okay, well, I'd like
to be briefed now.

56
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,149
Why don't you
go find some... Agent Tanner

57
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:39,610
with DHS. It's all right.
She's with me.

58
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,937
Okay, what's going on?
I show up to work today,

59
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:44,069
and my boss
tells me to report here.

60
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:46,661
Did... Did you do this?

61
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:48,358
Look, I know you've been saying

62
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:49,509
you want to get more serious,
but...

63
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:50,902
Did I go behind my
girlfriend's back

64
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:53,233
to try and coerce her
into working with me?

65
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:55,060
No.

66
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:57,237
I like how devoted you are
to your job.

67
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,587
In fact, your boss
recommended you.

68
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,284
Okay, for what?
Wh-What is all this?

69
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:02,807
You'll get a formal briefing,

70
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:04,829
but you saw the news about
those people on Belle Isle?

71
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:06,942
Yeah, some kind of protest.
Got out of hand.

72
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:09,988
That's the story we're
letting the press run with,

73
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:13,775
but there is zero chatter
or online organizing.

74
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:17,300
Thousands of people
just showed up.

75
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:19,171
We've tried fingerprinting

76
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:21,391
and run facial recognition
on hundreds so far.

77
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:24,394
The ones we've identified
are all missing persons cases

78
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:26,091
from the last couple decades.

79
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:29,486
Okay, so, what, they're all,
like, kidnapped and returned?

80
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,531
Unlikely.

81
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:31,894
They're from all
over the country.

82
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:33,316
All over the world.

83
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,728
- Some don't even speak English.
- Okay, Jessica,

84
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:36,711
what you are talking about is...

85
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:37,886
I know.

86
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:39,279
We're putting together teams

87
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:40,952
of corrections officers
and social workers

88
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:42,432
to see if you can get some
information out of them.

89
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:43,718
Quickly.

90
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:45,894
We've just been battling this
on all fronts,

91
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:47,219
especially trying
to keep it out of the press

92
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:49,114
until we have any kind
of handle on it.

93
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:51,334
Well, in my experience,
people lie when they get caught

94
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:53,641
doing things
they aren't supposed to.

95
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:56,296
We'll find the truth.

96
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:01,605
Can you tell me
what you remember?

97
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:02,930
Okay,
we're gonna figure this out.

98
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:05,130
We're gonna get everything
back to normal.

99
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:08,482
- I-I swear I'm gonna - do whatever I can do.
- Let me take a look at this.

100
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,964
Yes. It's not as bad
as I thought.

101
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:15,140
You doing all right, miss?

102
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:17,055
You know anything
about all this?

103
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:18,796
Was gonna ask you the same.

104
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,339
Well, last I knew,
I was in Mississippi,

105
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:22,365
and-and now they saying
we in Detroit?

106
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:24,759
This how people dress
in Detroit? How they act?

107
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:26,064
Something doesn't add up.

108
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:28,719
I'm Reverend Johnston. Isaiah.

109
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,155
It's a pleasure to meet you...

110
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,829
Little young to be a reverend,
aren't you?

111
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:33,202
Inherited the position.

112
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:35,378
Jesus is our family business.

113
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:37,859
Well, hopefully Jesus can
provide you with some insight.

114
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:39,774
If you'll excuse me.

115
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:46,781
Hi. I don't know
what kind of prank

116
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:48,391
my friends are pulling,
but I'm done.

117
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:50,828
Oh, um, this isn't actually...

118
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:51,979
Yeah, I mean,
this is all, like, real.

119
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:54,354
No. No.

120
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:57,487
Like, people must be looking
for me.

121
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,271
Okay, I have to get out of here

122
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:00,708
and tell my dad

123
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,492
I'm okay, so just...

124
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,408
Give me my phone back

125
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:07,584
and get me out
of this janky-ass hotel.

126
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:09,499
I need to speak with
whoever is in charge.

127
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:12,023
We have rights. You can't just
keep us here without cause.

128
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,895
Uh, sorry, everyone,
we can't actually...

129
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:16,027
I need to speak
with whomever is in charge

130
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:17,353
of medical personnel.
I need supplies.

131
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,379
- A workspace.
- We're not gonna get anything

132
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,293
while they continue to hold us
as prisoners.

133
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:22,860
Isn't that right?

134
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:24,079
I am with

135
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:26,429
a very prestigious law firm,

136
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:28,692
and I am going to rain hell down

137
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:32,130
on everyone who is party
to this unlawful detention.

138
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:35,046
Madam, I don't think
that kind of language

139
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,439
is constructive,
and I'm not sure

140
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:39,224
a secretary is
the most convincing messenger.

141
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:40,487
Excuse me?

142
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,705
You did not just say that

143
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:43,577
in Ruth Bader Ginsburg's
America.

144
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,230
Aw, sad.

145
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:46,623
RIP RBG, am I right?

146
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:50,192
What do you mean, "RIP"?

147
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:51,454
Well, like, how she died

148
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:53,891
last year?
It was pretty big news.

149
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:56,198
If...

150
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:57,939
If Justice Ginsburg had died,

151
00:06:57,982 --> 00:06:59,382
I think I would have
heard about it.

152
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,900
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
the new Supreme Court justice?

153
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:04,598
Apologies, whom
are we discussing?

154
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:07,601
Ruth Baiter...? There aren't any women
on the Supreme Court.

155
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:09,298
Can you just imagine?

156
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:11,101
I don't understand why
we're talking about...

157
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:13,365
or still talking
about the Supreme Court.

158
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:14,216
- Wait.
- There are things

159
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:15,435
that we need right here,

160
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:17,524
right now, like... Wait a minute.

161
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:19,264
Wait!

162
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:23,704
What-what year is it?

163
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:25,532
Um, it's-it's 2021.

164
00:07:25,575 --> 00:07:27,664
- Where are the cameras?
- Did you say 2021?

165
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,710
Where are the cameras?
Are you serious?

166
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:32,800
Yeah, what year did
you guys think it was?

167
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:34,062
This must be a mistake.

168
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:35,411
How can that be?

169
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:41,461
I can't be in 2021.

170
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,898
That would just be...
I don't know.

171
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:55,779
Hey. You must be Keisha.

172
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:57,172
I'm Jharrel.

173
00:07:57,215 --> 00:07:59,783
Social worker. Heard
we're gonna be partners.

174
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:01,568
This whole thing is wild, huh?

175
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:03,570
Excuse me. The
plexiglass should remain

176
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:05,441
for the duration
of the interviews.

177
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,009
I might have asked them
to take those down.

178
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:11,752
Look, I know they ran us through
the whole quarantine protocol,

179
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:13,928
but I work with immigrants
and refugees every day,

180
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:17,061
and trust me,
it is hard to connect

181
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:19,368
- with people through - suits and walls.
- Jharrel, is it?

182
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:21,413
I understand
you're the people person,

183
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:23,130
and I respect that, but this
is a volatile situation.

184
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:25,461
The rules are in place
for a reason.

185
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,202
Let's not break them on day one

186
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:29,165
just 'cause we want to get
in our feelings, okay?

187
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,990
- Glass stays on the table.
- Yes, ma'am.

188
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:34,688
Why didn't you

189
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:36,124
come to me sooner?

190
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,908
I noticed
your difficulty walking.

191
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,084
For all I know,
you just some charlatan

192
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:41,521
playing doctor.

193
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:43,348
Besides, I'm...

194
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:45,873
I'm well-accustomed to pain.

195
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:50,225
Well, I can put your mind
at ease that I am no charlatan.

196
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:51,531
I spend my time

197
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:53,968
running a clinic
up in North Harlem...

198
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:55,317
Hmm... where I get

199
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,406
to treat lots of ornery
Black folk like yourself.

200
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,846
You need to be seen.

201
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,809
There's white folk in here, too.

202
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,114
You would think...

203
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:13,291
Mm-hmm. All this talk
about the future.

204
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:17,228
You know, my husband and I
have been jailed and worse

205
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:19,384
for organizing the vote
for Negroes.

206
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:22,866
If it was really 2021,

207
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,390
I'd have hoped
we'd made more progress.

208
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,655
That it wouldn't feel the same.

209
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:38,012
I was driving to work.

210
00:09:38,055 --> 00:09:41,145
My first day back
after maternity leave.

211
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:42,427
And then suddenly,
there was this,

212
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:44,453
like, wind.

213
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,674
And I saw a green light
out of my window,

214
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:49,153
and then everything went black.

215
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:51,634
Wait, wait, I'm sorry.
You said you saw a light?

216
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,505
Like, a green light?

217
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:55,203
Yeah.

218
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:57,509
And now 16 years have passed?

219
00:09:57,553 --> 00:09:59,076
I'm not lying.

220
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,904
I'm speaking without counsel

221
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:03,167
because something strange
happened.

222
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:04,821
I've cooperated,

223
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:06,886
and you all have told me nothing
about what I'm being accused of.

224
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,801
- We're trying to get - to the truth.
- The truth is

225
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:10,610
that I just want to go home.

226
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:17,486
Please, my-my daughter, Mariah,

227
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:19,488
she's only four months old.

228
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:21,185
I hear you. All
right, and we are

229
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:23,448
working as fast as we can
to figure this out.

230
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,165
All right, we have a
bunch of people working

231
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:27,583
across the dozens of facilities
that are housing all of you.

232
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,585
Oh, my God,
that could take days.

233
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,500
Weeks.

234
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:35,243
And you're not gonna let me
see them, are you?

235
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,602
Bathroom's down the
end of the hall.

236
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,518
They're giving everybody
ten minutes, okay?

237
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:57,352
You okay?

238
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:00,224
No.

239
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:01,878
Oh, okay.

240
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:03,358
I've never been apart
from my baby

241
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:06,100
for more than a few hours.

242
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:09,016
She must be so scared.

243
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,195
I'm Shanice, by the way.

244
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:15,500
Mildred.

245
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:18,112
And I'm sorry.

246
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:20,070
You seem like a good mom.

247
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:22,725
I just want to get back to her.

248
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:45,574
What is going on?

249
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:47,097
I don't know,

250
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:48,577
but you should go.

251
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,946
- Yes, we should. Come on.
- I'm okay here.

252
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,754
I have nowhere to go.
Go to your family

253
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:54,496
and your baby. I'll stay here.
I'll keep watch.

254
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:58,674
I'll see you again
when I get you out of here,

255
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,806
okay?

256
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:17,562
Next stop, Woodward

257
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:21,001
and the Detroit Institute
of Arts.

258
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:24,352
That's just my baby dog.

259
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:34,101
No blood for oil!

260
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:36,146
Louder!
No blood for oil!

261
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,019
- No blood for oil!
- All right, let's go. You got to move.

262
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:40,063
No blood for oil!

263
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:41,891
- What?!
- No blood for oil!

264
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:43,521
You got to move. - You're blocking the sidewalk.
- No blood for oil!

265
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:45,503
We have the right to... No blood for oil!

266
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,157
No blood for oil!

267
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,179
- Hey! Hey, - don't put your hands on her!
- No blood for oil!

268
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:51,814
- She was pushed. - You could see that.
- No blood for oil!

269
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:53,337
No blood for oil!

270
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:54,991
- No blood for oil!
- Watch yourselves.

271
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:56,950
No blood for oil!

272
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:58,821
- No blood for oil!
- You all right?

273
00:12:58,865 --> 00:12:59,909
Oh, I'm fine.

274
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:02,346
It's that man
who wasn't raised right!

275
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,783
I know, right?

276
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:05,543
I don't know how parents
let their kids go out

277
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,177
in the world and treat
people like that.

278
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:09,963
This seems to be a pattern among
people who look a lot like you.

279
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:11,007
Fair.

280
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:12,835
Well, I'm gonna make
sure that my kid

281
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,969
has a kick-ass mom
who organizes protests

282
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:17,840
against travesties
like this sham war.

283
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:19,600
- No blood for oil!
- You got us raising kids

284
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:21,298
- before you even - bought me coffee?
- No blood for oil!

285
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:24,194
- Yeah, sorry.
- No blood for oil! No blood for oil!

286
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:26,544
Hey, I'm Logan, by the way.

287
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:28,198
You want to get coffee?

288
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:29,852
I'm a little busy right now.

289
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:31,723
And I'm not really trying
to discuss kids.

290
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,247
That's a long ways off for me.

291
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,857
That right?

292
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,772
That's right.
I am getting my law degree,

293
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,837
and I'm gonna advocate
for the people in my community

294
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,883
who have been screwed over
more times than I can count.

295
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:43,126
Detroit is on the verge
of a comeback,

296
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,563
and I plan to be a part
of making it happen.

297
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,565
All that's pretty heavy
for coffee.

298
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:50,742
I didn't say I'd go... It's
definitely first dinner talk, though.

299
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:52,962
- You free tonight?
- No blood for oil!

300
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:54,703
No blood for oil!

301
00:13:58,272 --> 00:13:59,751
No blood for oil!

302
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:02,885
No blood for oil! No blood

303
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:05,845
for oil! No blood for oil!

304
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:12,895
We've interviewed 15 people
so far and gotten nowhere.

305
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:14,723
Well, we know that
they all cleared

306
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:15,985
their medical screenings.

307
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,465
They don't pose a
danger to anyone.

308
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:19,075
But we don't know that.

309
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:20,792
Are we supposed to believe
these people don't remember

310
00:14:20,816 --> 00:14:22,731
- anything -about what happened to them?
- Keisha,

311
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:24,646
they're just as confused
as we are.

312
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:27,431
All right? We should help them.

313
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:29,259
Tell the public,
alert family members.

314
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:30,608
Tell the public what?

315
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:32,238
Some people got snatched up
by a green light

316
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:34,438
and just showed back up
out of nowhere? No.

317
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:36,092
There's something we're missing.

318
00:14:36,136 --> 00:14:38,616
Okay, and how long
until we have answers?

319
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,968
In the meantime, we are leaving
a lot of people out there

320
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:44,100
believing that their loved
ones are never coming home

321
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:47,103
when, really, we got them
locked up here in this hotel.

322
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,150
Have a seat.

323
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,981
Hey, I have to run an errand
real quick.

324
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:57,984
Can you take the last interview
of the day for me? Thanks.

325
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:10,692
You haven't spoken a word
since you arrived, huh?

326
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:16,132
I will need to find
new bandages.

327
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:20,920
This is remarkable.

328
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:24,619
It's almost fully healed.
How did this happen?

329
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:25,901
Did you receive treatment
from their doctors?

330
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,362
No, I didn't.

331
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:31,017
I-I think I should... Oh, no.

332
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,801
No, I'm fine.

333
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:34,759
It mustn't have been so
bad after all.

334
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:37,545
Go on, now. You got other
patients who need you.

335
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,128
Do you know sign language?

336
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:08,750
- What's going on?
- We have a problem.

337
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:11,187
Shanice Murray escaped.

338
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,712
I bet she's heading home.

339
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:22,764
Logan?

340
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:26,246
Logan, it's me.
Come on. Come on.

341
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:27,725
Logan!

342
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:30,511
Logan, please come out!

343
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:33,166
Someone's
breaking into my house.

344
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:34,558
She's Black.

345
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:35,907
Yes, I think she's armed.

346
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,758
You got here fast.

347
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:03,065
- Oh, he's with me.
- I got your text.

348
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:04,762
Owner just called the cops.

349
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,112
We're gonna fan out.
She's close.

350
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:09,071
And she's got no place
to stay. Cold night.

351
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:10,638
She'll find a place
that's open late.

352
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:12,074
Warm up.

353
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:13,945
Look, I think I saw a
diner down the street.

354
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,909
Hey.

355
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:22,191
Where do you think you're going?

356
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:24,217
Like he said, let's fan out.

357
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:45,151
Who is it?

358
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:46,543
It's-it's Shanice.

359
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:48,850
It's Shanice Murray.

360
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:51,505
Haven't known anybody
by that name in a long while.

361
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:55,291
Mrs. Grover,
you-you changed my diapers,

362
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:58,686
did my hair and fed me
every day after school.

363
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:00,905
Plus, I know that shotgun's
about a hundred years old,

364
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:03,299
and you're gonna hurt yourself
if you try to shoot me.

365
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:09,479
Neecey?

366
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:11,220
That you?

367
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:13,353
Come on in here out of the cold.
You're gonna

368
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:16,051
catch your death.

369
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:21,970
Jasmin. Hey.

370
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:25,104
Look, any sign of Manny at the
facility you were assigned to?

371
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:28,455
All right, hit me up
if you find anything.

372
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:29,847
Thanks.

373
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:43,165
They say this is
like a soda pop?

374
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:44,819
You just poke a hole in it?

375
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:47,561
Guess the government couldn't
spring for the real thing.

376
00:18:47,604 --> 00:18:50,477
You pull the tab
on the top. Here.

377
00:18:57,614 --> 00:18:59,486
Well, I'll be.

378
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:01,662
It's all bubbly
like just from the fountain.

379
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,577
Yes, ma'am.

380
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,710
Keep the line moving.
Let's go.

381
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:26,252
I told them I am
a sometime pescatarian,

382
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:27,601
ovo vegetarian.

383
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:29,733
Like, what is so
complicated about that?

384
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:33,868
Oh, my God.
Do you even speak English?

385
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,568
Oh, my God.

386
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,963
I have called home,

387
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:44,618
his office, his cell phone.
All disconnected.

388
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:46,489
How am I gonna track them down?

389
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,491
I couldn't find
your-your phone book.

390
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:51,059
The city stopped
putting those out years ago.

391
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:53,583
- Oh, my gosh.
- But I wrote down

392
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:56,978
the new address when they
moved out to Palmer Woods.

393
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:59,285
- Palmer Woods?
- Mm-hmm.

394
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,636
What's the address?
Can I borrow the Pontiac?

395
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:04,246
The car is gone.

396
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,988
And there is not
much more you can do

397
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:09,556
- until you get some sleep.
- No, I have to...

398
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,166
You're dead on your feet.

399
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,821
You're talking nonsense
and don't even know it.

400
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:16,215
Come on, now.
Drink your Vernors.

401
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,352
Rest up,

402
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:26,660
and you can find your
husband in the morning.

403
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:30,141
A few more hours ain't
gonna change anything

404
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:31,882
now that you're back.

405
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:34,233
I'm glad to see

406
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,800
you're not too much
like your daddy after all.

407
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,411
I'm nothing like him.

408
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:40,282
I didn't leave.

409
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:41,892
I...

410
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:44,243
I don't know what happened.
I wa...

411
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,854
I was home yesterday.

412
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:49,073
I just want to close my eyes

413
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:51,815
and have everything return
to normal.

414
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:53,252
I mean, if I... if...

415
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:55,210
If I can just see Logan

416
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:59,127
and-and...
and hug my little baby...

417
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:02,130
It'll be okay.

418
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:04,132
I know it will.

419
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:06,134
It has to be.

420
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,511
Well, damn. Lurk much?

421
00:21:37,948 --> 00:21:39,298
Can I help you?

422
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,996
Yes. Yes. I want you to cut me.

423
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,432
Oh, my God.

424
00:21:43,476 --> 00:21:46,479
Um, lady, look,
I know this is all a hot mess,

425
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:47,610
but are you okay?

426
00:21:47,654 --> 00:21:48,935
They won't give us
anything sharp,

427
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,178
so I need to use your nails.

428
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:51,484
Absolutely not.

429
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:53,442
Do you have any idea
how much I paid for these?

430
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:55,183
I just want to test a theory.

431
00:21:56,532 --> 00:22:00,536
Do it, and I won't tell
that guard you're sweet on

432
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,538
that you just made
yourself sick in here.

433
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:04,540
That's none of your business.

434
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:07,717
No, it surely isn't.

435
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:11,025
Fine.

436
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:19,816
Oh, my God.

437
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:23,429
Well, thank you kindly,

438
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:25,344
and you have a nice day now,
you hear?

439
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,302
I'm sorry, wait a minute.
That's it?

440
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,305
I mean, like, you're not gonna
bleed out, are you?

441
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,457
'Cause I am not trying to go
down for murder in a bathroom,

442
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:34,091
so... I...

443
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:51,805
Madam. Mrs. Williams,
you mustn't...

444
00:22:55,504 --> 00:22:57,288
But how can that be?

445
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:02,381
Is this some medical advance
from this era?

446
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:03,425
Nope, because I tried it,

447
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:04,731
and it still stings.

448
00:23:04,774 --> 00:23:07,342
But-but hers healed up
even faster this time.

449
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,778
I don't know how to explain it,

450
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:10,824
but I just started
feeling better.

451
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:14,218
Gradually more and more,
a-and now...

452
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:16,743
Now I feel great.

453
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:19,310
Well, that makes one of us.

454
00:23:20,137 --> 00:23:21,530
I think...

455
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:26,405
I think this could be
very detrimental to you

456
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,668
and perhaps to all of us
if they found out

457
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:29,973
about this.

458
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:33,847
We should not tell anyone else.

459
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:40,375
As if.

460
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,681
You know what? I don't know

461
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:42,919
what you two weirdos
are talking about,

462
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:44,466
and I don't care.

463
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,034
I'm so over all this.

464
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:59,394
I'm not going back.

465
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,700
Do you understand?

466
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:02,789
You can't keep me
from them. You have

467
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:04,747
- no legal right.
- Whoa, hey, hey.

468
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,096
I agree.

469
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,291
I don't like the way this thing

470
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:08,490
is being run, either.

471
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:10,797
But I'm not the one in charge.

472
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,102
So...

473
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:14,714
I'll take you to
see your family.

474
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:16,803
Look, I'll work it out
with the agents who are

475
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:18,500
watching the door to
your husband's house.

476
00:24:18,544 --> 00:24:21,285
But you got to return to the
hotel with me afterwards.

477
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:23,418
Deal?

478
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,508
Why would you help me?

479
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:28,205
Because if I was your family,

480
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:31,731
I would give anything
to know that you were okay.

481
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:35,996
Okay.

482
00:24:36,997 --> 00:24:38,433
This is me.

483
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:41,741
Weren't you
wearing that yesterday?

484
00:24:41,784 --> 00:24:43,743
Guilty.

485
00:24:43,786 --> 00:24:46,267
But you definitely
weren't wearing that.

486
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:49,052
Hey, Mrs. Grover's
sense of fashion is timeless.

487
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:51,185
Just ask her.

488
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,144
Let us out!

489
00:24:54,188 --> 00:24:57,278
Let us out! Let us out!

490
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:01,761
Let us out!

491
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:03,303
Let us out! Need some
backup in the lobby.

492
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:04,894
Everybody's so stressed out.

493
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:06,176
- Let us out!
- Back up. Back up!

494
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,394
- Let us out!
- You are in the custody

495
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:08,700
- of the United States government.
- Let us out!

496
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:10,857
You are being housed and
fed with our tax dollars.

497
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,207
- You all need to - stand down now!
- Let us out!

498
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,558
Let us out! Let us out!

499
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:22,433
Let us out!

500
00:25:22,477 --> 00:25:23,913
Let... Okay! O-Okay, folks.

501
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:27,003
I know it's been a long
couple of days, and tensions

502
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:29,005
are high. I feel you
on that, all right?

503
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:32,487
Now, we know it ain't right
to keep us locked up

504
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,533
when we haven't done
anything wrong.

505
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,058
But we also know that
something strange is going on

506
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:40,190
because just a couple days ago,

507
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:42,105
I was kicking back
watching Jordan

508
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:44,107
lead the Bulls
in the NBA Finals.

509
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:47,589
Hector, you had just gotten
back from the Korean War.

510
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:50,810
And, LaDonna, you were out
at some party. Then suddenly,

511
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:53,247
- you're here.
- So unfair.

512
00:25:54,074 --> 00:25:56,467
The government's trying to help.

513
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:59,993
And I think maybe they can find
a way to show us that.

514
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:01,690
How about we open up

515
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:03,344
some of those rooms
for people to have

516
00:26:03,387 --> 00:26:05,147
- a real bed to stay in tonight?
Those floors

517
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:07,609
- are currently closed.
- We have some time before nightfall.

518
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:09,393
As a gesture.

519
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:10,699
And tomorrow,

520
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:12,048
we'll be getting some answers.

521
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:12,875
That sounds like

522
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:14,355
a sign of good will to me.

523
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:17,445
For once.

524
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:22,798
That's right. We're all trying
to do our best here.

525
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:25,192
We're blessed in that.

526
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:27,542
Amen.

527
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:36,420
That was well-done
of the reverend.

528
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:38,335
That's because he
knows how to use

529
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:40,729
pretty words
to make people believe him.

530
00:26:40,773 --> 00:26:42,339
Men like him?

531
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:43,906
They dangerous.

532
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,865
Why would you think that?

533
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:48,215
Because I'm married to one.

534
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:05,406
Mariah?

535
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,364
You're...

536
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:09,584
Mom?

537
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:13,544
Oh, my God.

538
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:15,546
It's really you.

539
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,113
You're...

540
00:27:17,157 --> 00:27:19,028
You're really...

541
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:20,639
You're grown

542
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:23,163
Mariah, who's at
the door, sweetheart?

543
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:25,121
Logan?

544
00:27:25,165 --> 00:27:26,340
Oh, thank God.

545
00:27:27,602 --> 00:27:29,604
Shanice?

546
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,346
- Hey, get inside.
- But-but, Dad, wait.

547
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:34,189
- No, no, please.
- Come on. Come on, all right?

548
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:37,394
I can't believe it's her.

549
00:27:37,438 --> 00:27:39,919
Um, look, I don't...
I don't have much time,

550
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:41,703
but I had to come
and-and see you.

551
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:43,879
What are you doing
here, Shanice?

552
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,360
I came to find you.

553
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:47,990
You wouldn't believe
what I have been through.

554
00:27:48,014 --> 00:27:50,451
I mean,
I-I don't believe it, really,

555
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:51,844
but Mariah's a teenager,

556
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:53,323
so... Do you... Do you
really think

557
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,282
that you can just walk
out on your family

558
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:57,371
and come waltzing
back 16 years later

559
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:58,546
like it never happened?

560
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:00,287
"Walk out"?

561
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,898
That-That's not what happened.

562
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:04,204
I was taken

563
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:05,529
or-or something.
I don't actually know.

564
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:07,337
Wait, who's that?

565
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:10,123
He's... It's a long story.

566
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:12,647
That's what I'm trying
to tell you. The...

567
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,562
The day you say I left, for me,

568
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:16,607
that was two days
ago. I don't know.

569
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:17,870
I thought I'd have more time.

570
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:19,610
Logan, please, I need you
to listen to me.

571
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:20,916
I need help. We-we all

572
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,328
need help. They're
keeping us in this...

573
00:28:22,352 --> 00:28:24,137
- in this hotel downtown.
- Wait, who? Who?

574
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,462
There was this agent... Sir, stand back.

575
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:27,314
This woman is
a national security threat.

576
00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:28,857
She could pose a danger - to you and your family.
- That's not true.

577
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:30,665
- Mariah, stay back.
- What is going on?

578
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,362
Oh, my God.

579
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:33,581
Shanice?

580
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:37,063
You look just like
your pictures.

581
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:40,806
Shanice, you have
to come with us now.

582
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:43,069
How long?

583
00:28:44,853 --> 00:28:46,812
How long?

584
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:49,292
Nine years.

585
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:52,774
And she, she...

586
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:55,603
She raised my daughter?

587
00:29:01,174 --> 00:29:02,697
- Hey. Hey, hang on.
- No.

588
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,264
Don't put your hands on her.

589
00:29:04,307 --> 00:29:05,589
I don't...
I don't know what you thought,

590
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:06,875
but I did not leave.

591
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:09,182
I would never have left you.
I love you.

592
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:10,923
You are my family, and I will do

593
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:12,794
everything I can
to get back to you

594
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:14,859
- and make you understand.
- I don't know what you got yourself into,

595
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:17,146
Shanice, but don't lie to me.

596
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,974
Don't lie to our daughter.

597
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:21,890
I found your note.

598
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:25,807
No. No, Logan.

599
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:28,897
That's not what you think.
I can explain, Logan!

600
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:31,421
Logan! I can explain!

601
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:34,816
That's not
what you think, Logan!

602
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,991
Logan!

603
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:47,568
Do you have any idea

604
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:49,483
the destruction you
caused that family?

605
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:50,484
Why?

606
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:52,181
I didn't put her
in this position.

607
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:54,444
You did. Okay? She was never

608
00:29:54,488 --> 00:29:57,360
- supposed to make contact.
- She was coming in.

609
00:29:57,404 --> 00:29:59,623
Quietly. But instead,

610
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:01,016
you traumatize the kid,

611
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,975
had to witness her mom
being treated like that.

612
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:04,933
Someone helped her escape.

613
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:06,979
- What, you think I did that?
- I don't know.

614
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:10,460
But I do know when people
have something to hide.

615
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:13,246
Yeah?

616
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:15,552
Well, you're a cop
who believes in the system

617
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:17,946
over people's humanity.

618
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,253
I don't really trust you,
either.

619
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,315
Mrs. Murray,
you look unwell.

620
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,622
Where have you been?

621
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:44,407
Are you all right?

622
00:30:46,366 --> 00:30:48,368
Not really, Doc.

623
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:53,852
My husband...

624
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:55,984
is now married to someone else

625
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:59,640
who also raised
my 16-year-old daughter.

626
00:31:00,728 --> 00:31:02,643
I...

627
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:12,348
I was so scared
when I got pregnant.

628
00:31:13,132 --> 00:31:15,656
I wasn't ready to be a mother.

629
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:20,269
I had so much to do.

630
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,707
And when she was born,

631
00:31:23,751 --> 00:31:27,015
it wasn't that immediate
connection they tell you

632
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:28,364
it's gonna be.

633
00:31:30,105 --> 00:31:32,803
I was so worried
about my life changing,

634
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:35,719
about my career.

635
00:31:35,763 --> 00:31:38,200
And she was this...

636
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:41,247
this strange, little creature.

637
00:31:44,772 --> 00:31:47,427
I was in pain.
My head wasn't on straight.

638
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:52,084
But I got help.

639
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,788
And she and I, we...

640
00:32:00,831 --> 00:32:03,660
We grew into our love.

641
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:05,358
We fought

642
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:07,403
to get where we were, you know?

643
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:10,929
And I was never gonna stop
fighting for her.

644
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:14,671
But I missed it all.

645
00:32:15,803 --> 00:32:17,761
Her first words.

646
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:20,329
Her first steps.

647
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:24,464
Her first everything.

648
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:27,510
She was this tiny, little blob

649
00:32:27,554 --> 00:32:31,775
in my arms, and now she
has had a whole life.

650
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:33,821
And...

651
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:35,257
she didn't...

652
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:37,868
she didn't need me.

653
00:32:57,801 --> 00:33:00,674
You're gonna get to sleep
in a real bed tonight.

654
00:33:00,717 --> 00:33:03,242
I thought at least that would've
put a smile on your face.

655
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:04,634
No.

656
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:06,375
No, I'm in the future,

657
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,116
and you're, like,
one of the X-Men.

658
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,292
- I'm a what now?
- And I'm stuck in this dump,

659
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:13,382
I'm totally alone,
and I just want my phone back.

660
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:17,299
I'll admit I think y'all have
a real surprising attachment

661
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:18,822
to telephones now.

662
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:19,910
And

663
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:21,738
I can't say
what's happening here

664
00:33:21,782 --> 00:33:23,871
other than to take as truth

665
00:33:23,914 --> 00:33:26,134
what I done seen
with my own two eyes.

666
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:28,180
But I do know one thing.

667
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:30,486
You're not alone.

668
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,098
You, me, the doc,

669
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:35,665
everyone in here,
we are all in this together.

670
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:39,365
And that's the only way we gonna
get through it. You hear me?

671
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,634
Say, you think
that piano's in tune?

672
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:01,778
Old people are far-out.

673
00:34:17,229 --> 00:34:20,884
Am I to ascertain that ragtime
is no longer in vogue?

674
00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:23,191
Wait till you
hear the "Thong Song."

675
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:24,758
Mrs. Williams is

676
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:27,041
quite a surprising talent.
Perhaps she'll play it for us.

677
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:29,328
Maybe.
In the meantime,

678
00:34:29,371 --> 00:34:31,721
would you care to dance?

679
00:35:02,926 --> 00:35:04,580
Okay, they've had their fun.

680
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:09,255
You have to stop playing, ma'am.

681
00:35:12,762 --> 00:35:16,549
- Hey, what is wrong with you?
- She tripped.

682
00:35:16,592 --> 00:35:18,159
- I didn't touch her.
- Is there some rule

683
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:19,919
against playing the piano
that nobody knows about?

684
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:21,031
This isn't summer camp.

685
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:22,207
We have a schedule.

686
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,773
- Come on!
- Line up!

687
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:25,601
Rotating the second
shift into dinner

688
00:35:25,645 --> 00:35:26,820
in five.

689
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:29,170
The piano is off-limits.

690
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:39,528
You okay?

691
00:35:39,572 --> 00:35:42,444
- Let me see.
- I'll examine her,

692
00:35:42,488 --> 00:35:44,185
but it looked benign to me.

693
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:46,013
Really? Because it sounded

694
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:48,122
like it was bad... Just-just
hit my funny bone is all.

695
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,931
But thank you for your concern.

696
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,561
This seat taken?

697
00:36:12,605 --> 00:36:14,520
I'm not interested.

698
00:36:14,563 --> 00:36:17,349
And I'm definitely
not interested.

699
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:20,700
Now, I have to turn in
a report tomorrow morning

700
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:22,441
about what went down today,
and...

701
00:36:22,484 --> 00:36:24,486
Look, is there anything
you want to tell me?

702
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:27,054
A reason you're so protective
of Shanice Murray?

703
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:30,840
I was protective
because I have seen what happens

704
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:32,364
when a powerful
government machine

705
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:35,062
treats people like
they're problems

706
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:36,996
- instead of human beings.
- That's not what's happening.

707
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,520
Okay... We don't know
what's happening.

708
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:41,199
All right? We know some people
appeared out of nowhere,

709
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:43,244
and some of them
are from the past.

710
00:36:43,288 --> 00:36:45,377
Now, tell me, how do you think

711
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,814
our government
is gonna react to that?

712
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:51,383
Look, you might
be a good person.

713
00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:54,429
All right, the people we report
to might be good people.

714
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:58,041
But even good people
justify very bad things

715
00:36:58,085 --> 00:37:00,261
in the name of doing their jobs.

716
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:03,046
In the name
of keeping people safe.

717
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,136
The truth is, I thought...

718
00:37:09,618 --> 00:37:13,187
My brother Manny is missing,

719
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,973
and I thought that I had seen
a green light out the window

720
00:37:17,017 --> 00:37:19,062
right after he left.

721
00:37:19,106 --> 00:37:21,369
The first time

722
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:23,284
in a year

723
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,199
I had real hope.

724
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:29,116
There's no sign of Manny
among any of these people.

725
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:31,423
And I am gonna have to face
the fact

726
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:33,990
that I'll probably
never see him again.

727
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:42,477
Well, it's been real.

728
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,567
I'll fix it with DHS.

729
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:49,005
Okay? I've got...

730
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:51,181
connections.

731
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:55,447
So that is what is going on
between you and Agent Tanner,

732
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,971
huh? Connections.

733
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,978
I know what it's like

734
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:07,067
to lose someone
you were supposed to protect.

735
00:38:08,677 --> 00:38:10,288
Okay, my sister was killed

736
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:13,203
walking home from the library
five years ago.

737
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:15,205
Gunfire. Not meant for her.

738
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:18,600
A parolee who shouldn't
have had access to a weapon.

739
00:38:18,644 --> 00:38:19,993
Keisha, I'm sorry. I didn't...

740
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:21,995
It's hard
to let anyone get close.

741
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:24,345
Anyone you could ever let down
like that again.

742
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:27,043
Easier to protect strangers.

743
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:33,920
Uh, hey, can you
turn that up for me?

744
00:38:33,963 --> 00:38:35,443
We are following up

745
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:37,924
on explosive allegations
about the mysterious gathering

746
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:39,578
on Belle Isle two nights ago.

747
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:41,667
A whistleblower tells us
a number of the people

748
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,495
have been identified
as missing persons

749
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:45,453
who all appeared
at the same location

750
00:38:45,497 --> 00:38:46,672
for reasons unknown.

751
00:38:46,715 --> 00:38:48,848
We are told the total number
of returnees

752
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:50,502
is 4,400,

753
00:38:50,545 --> 00:38:53,635
and they're being held
at undisclosed locations.

754
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:03,515
Where'd you disappear
to yesterday?

755
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:05,473
- I got out.
- Out?

756
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:07,649
- How?
- I don't know.

757
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:09,390
The door just opened.

758
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:11,784
So that's what got
the guards' cages all rattled.

759
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:13,133
And?

760
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:14,700
Is it true?

761
00:39:14,743 --> 00:39:18,573
Unless someone's put together
a very elaborate hoax,

762
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:21,184
it's really 2021.

763
00:39:22,316 --> 00:39:24,057
And they came after me.

764
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,276
Sent the whole cavalry
to bring me back in.

765
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,540
That's a whole lot of effort
for one Black woman.

766
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:31,281
Yep. So, why us?

767
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:33,719
Far as I can tell,
we have nothing in common.

768
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:35,590
Not where we're from.
Not when we're from.

769
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:38,724
So why now? Why this?

770
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:41,770
For some reason, we're special.

771
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:45,426
As much as I wish I didn't have
anything to do with any of this,

772
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,907
I've realized that if we have
that kind of value,

773
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,388
it means one more thing.

774
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:52,738
Yeah, and what's that?

775
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:54,957
We're not powerless.

776
00:39:58,352 --> 00:40:02,051
I think I might just like 2021.

777
00:40:05,272 --> 00:40:07,230
There's news vans outside.

778
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:09,537
- You holding up?
- Hounded by the press,

779
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:10,712
the White House,

780
00:40:10,756 --> 00:40:12,671
people who think
we have their loved ones.

781
00:40:12,714 --> 00:40:14,412
These people,

782
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:16,762
the ones we can find data on,
follow no clear pattern.

783
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:18,764
They're just standard
missing persons cases.

784
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:23,290
Others match records that defy
every logical explanation.

785
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:26,206
The Pentagon
is exploring every theory.

786
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:28,556
They're reading in NASA.

787
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,646
Do they think this is
something extraterrestrial?

788
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:32,952
I know it sounds crazy,

789
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:34,475
but the time period
discrepancies?

790
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,651
Some people have reported
seeing green lights?

791
00:40:36,695 --> 00:40:40,655
The way none of this makes sense
or is even possible?

792
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:44,398
I'm glad you're here.

793
00:40:46,008 --> 00:40:47,140
And...

794
00:40:47,183 --> 00:40:51,187
be careful with them.

795
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:01,241
What are you doing out here?

796
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:05,419
I'm glad they finally found you
something else to wear.

797
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,683
Heard they were gonna hit up
the Salvation Army.

798
00:41:10,163 --> 00:41:11,991
You know,
my sister and I saw her

799
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:13,645
at Ford Field when we were kids.

800
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:16,735
She wanted to be
a rapper/mogul/collaborator

801
00:41:16,778 --> 00:41:18,127
just like Missy.

802
00:41:19,738 --> 00:41:23,176
You don't even know who that is,
do you?

803
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:28,268
Come on.

804
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:30,313
Let's get you in a room
so you can get some sleep.

805
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:33,795
Tell Jharrel
that Manny's all right.

806
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,973
And that he's sorry
for everything.
