1
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,442
So,

2
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:10,616
I know you've been in the dumps,
but I have the best

3
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,313
weekend planned.
I'm talking tacos,

4
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,748
pizza, Korean barbecue,
if I can convince Dad.

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,185
And... wait for it...
An all-weekend anime marathon.

6
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:23,091
Hayden,

7
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:25,259
you, uh... you there?

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,928
I'm sorry.
My mind was elsewhere.

9
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,663
I'm-I'm sure whatever

10
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:33,301
this Annie Mae does is sure
to be remarkable.

11
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:36,036
That's not...

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,872
Are you still thinking
of busting Mildred

13
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:41,709
out of that hospital?

14
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:51,719
Hayden, where... where'd you go?

15
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:55,123
I just had a... vision

16
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:58,626
of Mildred in pain.

17
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,728
Being treated worse
at this new facility

18
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:03,564
than anything
in the video you leaked.

19
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,667
Look, I-I know it sounds crazy.

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,502
No, it-it doesn't sound crazy.

21
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,046
I mean, visions from the
universe are no joke.

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,839
Some people just have,
like, a hella open

23
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:13,374
third eye.

24
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:17,378
So, if the universe says
Mildred's in trouble...

25
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,747
My world-famous Kaminski Cakes
are ready.

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,520
I know how much you
enjoyed 'em last time,

27
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,083
Hayden, so I doubled the batch.

28
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,552
I don't enjoy them.

29
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:27,321
I love them.

30
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,157
They make me feel like
this is home,

31
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:31,892
that I'm wanted.

32
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,195
Well, you most definitely
are, bud.

33
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:35,896
Okay, well, uh,

34
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,531
get 'em while they're hot.

35
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:39,900
And, uh, when you're done,
I'll drop you off

36
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,869
at the hotel
for your first check-in.

37
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:46,940
Are you sure
about saving Mildred?

38
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:50,778
Yes.

39
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,281
Without her, I...

40
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:58,452
I don't know
if I can be without her.

41
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:04,458
I'll help. Okay? Just

42
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:08,128
promise me
my dad will never find out.

43
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:16,770
And I can't believe the 4,400
have to be out of the hotel

44
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,439
by the end of the week.

45
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,092
After all that fuss
to keep them there,

46
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,876
now it's just... bye. Yeah.

47
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,312
With nothing but a stipend

48
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,214
and some housing
to help them adjust.

49
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:27,648
But they've left
Claudette alone.

50
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,617
It must mean they
don't know about her.

51
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,385
Or that we know about her.

52
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:33,587
Man.

53
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,489
No, I'm still kind of shook.

54
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,225
I mean, superpowers are real.

55
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,760
And Claudette wants us
to believe that it's just her.

56
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,738
Girl just wants to be left alone
to live her life.

57
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,464
She's currently nesting

58
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,077
pretty hard
in my brother's apartment,

59
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:47,501
but, well, I can't be mad
at her for that.

60
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:50,137
No.

61
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:53,006
Yo, you're not having
second thoughts, right?

62
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,508
About telling the government,

63
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,009
telling your girlfriend? No.

64
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:57,454
I don't trust
telling the government

65
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:58,512
anything at this point.

66
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,848
I mean, what would I say anyway?

67
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,916
A '50s housewife is Wolverine?

68
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,985
True.

69
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,787
You think she's the only one?

70
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,623
Between Shanice escaping,
our nap at Belle Isle,

71
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:12,693
and whatever went down
with Mildred, there's no way.

72
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:15,972
Man, if the government
had even an inkling

73
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,365
about half of this...

74
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,300
The 4,400 would be
locked back up.

75
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,835
Yeah, I want to help them,
but I don't know how.

76
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,838
I'll tell you what we do.
We ask them.

77
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,708
Trust me, I have
learned the hard way

78
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,853
that you can't fix people's
lives the way you want to.

79
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,713
You got to find out
what they need.

80
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:35,716
And the hard part is gonna be
getting them to talk to us.

81
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,718
Will you be

82
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,387
returning to Miami then?

83
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,888
My mom wants me to,

84
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,723
but some producers reached out.

85
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:45,192
Maybe I just go straight to L.A.

86
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:48,329
I don't know. What about you?
Back to New York?

87
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:51,799
Perhaps. Although I'm not sure
what's left for me there now.

88
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,301
And Shanice isn't there?

89
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:55,035
Well, that is... There isn't...

90
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,037
She and I aren't...
I need your help.

91
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,906
Oh, young Hayden.

92
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,809
How are things at the,
uh... the house?

93
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,911
At Shanice's husband's
and daughter's house?

94
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,047
What? It's not my
fault you're a messy,

95
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,340
time-travelling doctor who
lives for drama. It has been

96
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,528
two weeks since Noah and Mildred
were taken to Ypsi Med.

97
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,086
I want us to go get them out.

98
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,392
Look, I had a vision.
Of Mildred.

99
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:20,394
And a chartreuse door.

100
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:23,764
She was screaming and being
injected with something.

101
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,166
For some reason,

102
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,935
I keep seeing it again...

103
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,671
and again and again.

104
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,242
Look, we have to save her.

105
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:36,744
If we don't do it soon, I think

106
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,054
something terrible
is gonna happen to her.

107
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:39,380
Look, I have a plan,

108
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:40,781
but I need you both to do it.

109
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,783
I need your powers, LaDonna.
Oh, okay.

110
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,084
And your medical background,

111
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,886
Dr. Andre. What? Like, you leave

112
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,697
for a few days, and all of
a sudden, you're Danny Ocean?

113
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,423
LaDonna, the boy
misses his friends.

114
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:52,760
We understand
you're concerned, but

115
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,295
what you're suggesting
is a bit extreme.

116
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:56,797
We're all about to be released.

117
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,930
Now, this sort of action

118
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,867
could very well jeopardize that.

119
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,727
Especially when Jharrel
and Keisha know about.

120
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:03,913
Claudette's powers. You didn't
know about that, did you?

121
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:07,441
Look, she was barely able to
cover up for the rest of us, so,

122
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:10,310
now is not the time for people
to be putting a spotlight on us.

123
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:11,912
Mm. Besides, you said yourself,

124
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,948
sometimes your visions
aren't always complete.

125
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,122
They don't repeat, either.

126
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,151
Look, time is running out.

127
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,653
I can't just sit by
and do nothing.

128
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,990
I need her back.

129
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,234
That's Ruth's boy, right?

130
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,903
Yep.

131
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,171
My sister spawned a bit
of an odd duck,

132
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:39,773
if you catch my meaning.

133
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:42,943
And she's having to raise
the boy all on her own. Mm.

134
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:48,449
How you doing, boy?

135
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:49,959
You're being mighty rude
not saying anything

136
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,351
to your Uncle Otis.

137
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,454
Hello. Look at

138
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,155
your elders when
they're talking to you.

139
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,133
Now, if you're gonna keep
being disrespectful...

140
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,759
Then I'll discipline him.

141
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,470
Now, why don't you both
go get some drinks

142
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:01,695
so people can have an excuse

143
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,697
of why you're acting
a fool right now.

144
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,769
Come on, baby.

145
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:13,541
Hayden.

146
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,009
Hey.

147
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,312
Hey.

148
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:23,316
Could you play a game
of chess with me, please?

149
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:24,718
Uh, I don't want to bother you,

150
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,186
but I really need this.

151
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,557
First, you're gonna sit down,

152
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,625
and you're gonna breathe.

153
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:34,862
Yeah.

154
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,296
Hey.

155
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,700
Yeah.

156
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:48,141
Now, despite how it looks,

157
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,910
I'm busy right now,

158
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,579
so I can't play with you.

159
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:55,516
So I need you to be
the sharp young man

160
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:56,850
that I know you are

161
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:59,219
and find a solution
for yourself.

162
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,589
Hey, hey.

163
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:04,224
Focus, Hayden.

164
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,326
You want to play chess.

165
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,428
But I can't play with you.

166
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:12,933
So how can you play without me?

167
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:16,870
I...

168
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:19,106
I could... I...

169
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,875
I could play against myself.

170
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:25,713
Oh, I knew you could do it.

171
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:29,416
Us Turners are amazing
problem solvers.

172
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,619
Mwah.

173
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:36,256
I can't lose her for good.

174
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,125
I won't.

175
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,032
- Amen, brothers and sisters.
- See you tomorrow.

176
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,400
Absolutely. Absolutely.

177
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:49,737
Thank you, brother,
I appreciate you.

178
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,609
Thank you so much for
these meetings, Reverend.

179
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:57,911
Before I found this group,

180
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,205
I was in a really dark place.

181
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,881
I thought God abandoned me.

182
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,484
Just remember, the Lord
doesn't leave us in darkness

183
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:05,819
without a little light.

184
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:08,155
A thing you know
better than most.

185
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,058
Thank you.

186
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,329
Have you seen Andre?

187
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:17,765
I have not.

188
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,300
But I do want to pick
your lawyer brain,

189
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,769
if you don't mind.

190
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,780
I'd like to find a way
to get the powers that be

191
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,806
to allow folks
to stay at the hotel.

192
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,809
What? Everyone
is finally getting out.

193
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,844
After all our pushing
and protesting,

194
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,012
we're gonna be free.

195
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,681
Well, many people,
myself included,

196
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:34,982
have nowhere to go.

197
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,484
This "freedom" might be
a salve for you,

198
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:40,420
but for myself and others,
it's poison.

199
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,656
Everyone is getting
placed in housing

200
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,791
and given a stipend.

201
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,525
You think everybody getting out

202
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,528
is the solution because
it works for your situation.

203
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,998
You'll be staying with
family, I presume?

204
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,433
Mrs. Grover
is like family to me.

205
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,368
And I'm pleased
that you have her.

206
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,705
This is a turbulent time
for us all.

207
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:01,041
And for some, being thrown
into housing they don't know

208
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:02,676
in a city they don't know,

209
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,946
in a world they don't know
is terrifying.

210
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,216
We've created a community here.

211
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,985
I'm sorry you can't see that.

212
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,028
They couldn't kick you out
if the hotel was a church.

213
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,133
Would it really work?

214
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,901
It's not a given,

215
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,303
but most still respect
the concept of sanctuary

216
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,673
that churches offer.
If the government

217
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:35,075
tried to kick us out, they'd
be drowning in lawsuits

218
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,710
from human rights groups
worldwide.

219
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:39,980
We just have to
get the word out.

220
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,651
Well... let's create ourselves

221
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,418
a sanctuary, then.

222
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:48,255
Technically,

223
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,833
you are the reason both
of them are at Ypsi Med.

224
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:51,457
Not on purpose, of course,
but, you know,

225
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,060
accident or not,
you do have to kind of

226
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,494
take responsibility for that.

227
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,597
Well, as far a responsibility
is concerned,

228
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:01,001
your video made us targets for
all sorts of ne'er-do-wells,

229
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,737
like that bar patron
who assaulted Claudette.

230
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,238
TouchÃ©.

231
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:06,707
It's just,
I've never seen Hayden

232
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,317
like that before, you know?
He's usually

233
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,177
all al-aloof and stuff.

234
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,521
But back there he looked really
ready to, like, square up.

235
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,281
Indeed. So what do we do, then?

236
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:15,949
'Cause he is really stubborn

237
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,226
and is not gonna let this go.

238
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,252
Trust him, I suppose.

239
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:22,122
The hotel is abuzz
with everyone getting out,

240
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,291
so our keepers
aren't watching us as usual.

241
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,293
And while lacking in context,

242
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,396
his visions come to pass
with unerring accuracy.

243
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:30,731
Great!

244
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,599
Now let's get on with it.
Stop doing that.

245
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,577
Oh, my God, you're gonna
give me so many stress lines.

246
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,469
You said you had a plan. I do.

247
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:39,272
We want to get Mildred and Noah
out of Ypsi Med,

248
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,006
hide them in here
till things quiet down.

249
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,142
First step:

250
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,643
Reconnaissance.

251
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:47,547
Starting with
one chartreuse door.

252
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,362
The technological advances
here are greater

253
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,454
than even I'd imagined.

254
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,957
Okay. I'm glad

255
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,591
you're enjoying everything.

256
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:00,460
Look, I know it's
taken a long time

257
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:01,795
to get you into a hospital.

258
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:03,563
And I cannot apologize
enough for that.

259
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,334
But we're here now, and while
you're doing your shadowing,

260
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,645
I'm gonna try and get some info
on Mildred and Noah for you.

261
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,604
It is appreciated.

262
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:13,783
It's been so long since we last
heard from either of them,

263
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,744
I'd begun to think our pleas
had fallen on deaf ears.

264
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:23,784
Name? Jharrel Mateo.

265
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,285
I have a shadowing appointment

266
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,698
for my friend right here.

267
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,288
I'll let the doctor know
he's here.

268
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,622
Oh, I had one more thing.

269
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:31,158
Could you get me the room info

270
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,927
so that I can visit Mildred Bell
and Noah Harris?

271
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,029
They're from the
Bois Blanc hotel.

272
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:39,366
The 4,400 are
in a different wing

273
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,201
and don't have visiting hours.

274
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:44,838
A different wing? Okay, but,
uh, I'm not a regular visitor.

275
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,940
I'm a caseworker. The 4,400?

276
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,843
Like I said, there are
no visiting hours.

277
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:51,857
Haven't been since they
took over the East Wing.

278
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:57,384
Go ahead and fill this out,
and here's a pass

279
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,120
for you and your friend.

280
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,292
Miguel?

281
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,341
Were you able to get everything?

282
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,878
Hayden, my boy, my lad,
my homie,

283
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:28,248
I got everything
and then some, okay?

284
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,050
First, we have nurse scrubs.

285
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,920
A size medium for one Dr. Andre.

286
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:38,025
Then we have patient scrubs
for you.

287
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,060
And then, there it is.

288
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,429
Thumb drives,
requested by LaDonna.

289
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,564
Why are thumb drives
shaped like food?

290
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:49,736
No? Okay, well, then we have
three two-way radios

291
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,771
and some earpieces.

292
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,406
And...

293
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,278
It's labradorite.

294
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:59,989
A gemstone well respected
for its ability

295
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,581
to banish fear and anxiety.

296
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,951
It can also boost
psychic abilities.

297
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:06,719
Try it on. Come on.

298
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:10,924
Why'd you get it?

299
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:14,127
'Cause I want to make sure
you make it out in one piece.

300
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,729
And we have an anime marathon
to do still, so...

301
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:20,800
Oh, um, my, um...

302
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,469
Shanice doesn't know

303
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:26,639
anything about this, does she?

304
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:29,642
No. Okay, good.

305
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,478
Do-do you want her to?

306
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,745
No, not at all.

307
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,814
I mean, she'd probably freak out

308
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:37,317
that this is really dangerous.

309
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:42,289
I know I'm just
the getaway driver...

310
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,824
And I'm all in... but,

311
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,402
I mean, I only have
my learner's permit.

312
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:51,564
Hayden, this is all
totally necessary. Right?

313
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,968
We have to get them out.

314
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:56,970
I know what they do
in places like that.

315
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:58,805
The guards here assaulted Noah.

316
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:01,741
The government stole him
away on my birthday.

317
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,847
They took Mildred, the
closest person to me, away.

318
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,517
Refused to let me know anything
about how she's doing.

319
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,685
And they destroyed
the chess set she gave me.

320
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,654
The set she made for me.

321
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,456
The only thing
I had left of her.

322
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,826
So, yes, this has to happen
because I need Mildred,

323
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,996
and I'm gonna bring her back.

324
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,531
Hayden, Hayden.

325
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,500
I'm so sorry.

326
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:31,204
It was a long day
visiting factories,

327
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:34,341
but I finally found
a distributor.

328
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,010
Your mom's baked goods
are gonna be sold

329
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:39,446
all through the Midwest.

330
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,549
I left a note
to your Aunt Marietta

331
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:45,152
explaining that you are
sensitive to certain textures.

332
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,221
She should have known better than
to make you noodles. It's fine.

333
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,057
No, it's not.

334
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,025
Sweetie, why didn't you
say anything to her?

335
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,826
I didn't want to.

336
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,996
Are you mad?

337
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,198
Never.

338
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:02,569
I love how careful
you are with your words,

339
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:05,305
but you need to advocate
for yourself.

340
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,010
Watch carefully, crumb cake.

341
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,678
I'm gonna show you something.

342
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:19,086
Solving a problem is
a lot like baking.

343
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:23,556
We start with what we want,

344
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,692
then look at what tools
and ingredients

345
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,995
we have at our disposal.

346
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,831
We put those together, and...

347
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,099
we get the thing we wanted.

348
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:47,347
Come here, come here.
There you go, baby.

349
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:54,187
Oh, how did
the reconnaissance go?

350
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,357
You two won't believe
the things I've seen.

351
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,960
In that device is a video
of Miguel... yes,

352
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,296
our doctor here
at the Bois Blanc...

353
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,567
Taking a 4,400 through
that chartreuse door.

354
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,802
And I caught him on video
as he put in the code

355
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,638
to open the door.

356
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:14,241
No way. You're, like,
totally the GOAT right now.

357
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,985
What the hell?

358
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,225
I taught you better than this.

359
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,062
Hayden, uh... Hayden, I'm sorry

360
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,442
to have jeopardized the mission.

361
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,331
We need to get behind that door.

362
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:39,632
Which means we need the code.

363
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:47,574
Wait, you saw him.

364
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,674
You saw him punch it in.

365
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,510
Yes, but I don't remember.

366
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,523
But Shanice can see
your memory; She can see it.

367
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,981
I don't think that's a good...

368
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,184
Isn't there any other way?

369
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:58,461
What the doctor's
trying to say is that

370
00:16:58,485 --> 00:16:59,852
something happened between them

371
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,421
to make things
capital-A awkward.

372
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,290
Getting Mildred and Noah
out of that place

373
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,958
has to be more important than
whatever discomfort you have.

374
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:08,294
Please.

375
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,774
Imagine my surprise

376
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,543
when I heard you wanted to meet.

377
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,978
Even ordered you a drink.

378
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:29,549
I just wanted to try and build
a bridge between us.

379
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:30,983
One of more honest
communication.

380
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:32,219
Really?

381
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:41,060
Well, if we're being
honest, uh...

382
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,363
there are a group of people
at the hotel

383
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,565
who have created a church here.

384
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,334
They don't want to leave.

385
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,303
Why would anyone want to stay
at the hotel

386
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,905
after all that time wanting out?

387
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:57,244
Are...

388
00:17:57,377 --> 00:18:00,147
are you... scared?

389
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,715
What are you getting at?

390
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,818
I know about the powers.

391
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,821
I saw Claudette heal herself
in this bar, and...

392
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,357
she admitted it to Jharrel.

393
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,759
What exactly did she say?

394
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,262
That it has nothing to do
with the 4,400,

395
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,697
and she was a secret superhero

396
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,832
in the '50s, and, I quote,

397
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,568
"Wonder Woman was Black first."

398
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,172
You must have been

399
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,339
pretty tipsy that night.

400
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,907
I don't know how

401
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,385
you let Claudette yank
your chain like that...

402
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,043
Shanice, I know what I saw.

403
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:33,546
You know I saw it, since it
happened at Mrs. Grover's, too.

404
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,183
Jharrel and I think
there are more of you

405
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,117
that have some kind of...

406
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,253
powers.

407
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:42,555
But we can't confirm that
unless you open up.

408
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,123
And if you don't open up,

409
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,392
we can't protect you.

410
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,626
We'll be fine.

411
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,060
I've tussled

412
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:49,061
with the government before.

413
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:51,264
Yeah, in 2005.

414
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,342
The 2021 government is
a whole different beast, okay?

415
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:56,203
You have no idea
what it's capable of.

416
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:00,707
Have fun hunting down

417
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:01,887
the other members of the...

418
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,576
Justice League.

419
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:16,989
Shanice.

420
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:20,760
Andre. Hi.

421
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,062
I thought you were avoiding me.

422
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,164
I've... just been busy.

423
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:31,338
I do have something
I need to talk to you about.

424
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,617
Hayden, LaDonna and myself
are planning on rescuing

425
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,643
Mildred and Noah from Ypsi Med.

426
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:38,945
Andre, no.

427
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,180
What will they do to you
if you get caught?

428
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:44,451
This is the time for us
to keep our heads down.

429
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:46,185
They already know
about Claudette.

430
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,163
And Keisha asked me directly
if more of us have powers.

431
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,589
She's not gonna let it go

432
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,489
until she finds something.
Well, the situation

433
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,993
isn't ideal,
but Hayden had a vision

434
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,996
of Mildred being held
and injected with something

435
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,369
in a separate wing of Ypsi Med.

436
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:01,167
It's likely Noah's there
as well.

437
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:02,635
Right now...

438
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:06,038
our whole plan rests
on you recovering a code

439
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,340
from my memory.

440
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,509
Can you help us?

441
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,615
Knowing how
we've been treated here,

442
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,451
I wouldn't be surprised
if some places are even worse.

443
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:22,855
Let's do this.

444
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,577
Do you see it?

445
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,012
No, I...

446
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:48,080
I see the hospital,
but it's all hazy.

447
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,849
Nothing really concrete.

448
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,485
Keep trying. I know it's there.

449
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,422
Look, I'm sorry.

450
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,490
This is new to me.

451
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,025
You can do this.

452
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,394
I believe in you.

453
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,247
I got it. I got the code.

454
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,724
Thanks, Logan.

455
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:33,760
I love you.

456
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:42,068
Andre,

457
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,236
I-I'm... Mrs. Murray...

458
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:47,774
the code, please.

459
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,955
Thank you for your help.

460
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,933
Shanice was a dead end.

461
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,602
Scratch that,
she was a brick wall.

462
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:17,279
Yeah, Andre really wasn't
in a talkative mood, either.

463
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,238
Look, clearly, if
we want them to open up,

464
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:23,242
we got to do something to prove
to them that we can help.

465
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,278
You know, actions speak louder
than words.

466
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:29,015
Hey, what about,
uh, Mildred and Noah?

467
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:31,651
If we got info on them, Hayden
might be open to talking to us.

468
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:34,787
And frankly, I want to know
what's happening with them, too.

469
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:36,355
Well, I got nothing.

470
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:38,691
Okay, Ypsi Med
is apparently a fortress,

471
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,293
with the 4,400
in some inaccessible wing

472
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:43,663
and absolutely
no visiting hours.

473
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,833
Well, I could go to Jessica,

474
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,868
see if she can give me any info.

475
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,971
You're gonna go to Ypsi Med?
You think that'll work?

476
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,582
You said actions speak louder
than words.

477
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:55,041
If we want them to trust us,

478
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:57,309
e'll have to do something bold. w.

479
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,349
Where are you taking him?

480
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,954
Um, he's...

481
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,989
one of them.

482
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,458
Okay.

483
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,910
This is no hospital.

484
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:32,912
There aren't even any cameras.

485
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:35,314
You said cameras are ubiquitous.
Well, yeah,

486
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,884
if you're not trying to be,
like, hella on the down-low.

487
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:42,655
No cameras means no evidence.

488
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,558
Okay, I'm gonna go
find Miguel's office.

489
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:47,393
I'm still in awe
of the illusion.

490
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:48,761
Cannot believe it is you.

491
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:50,262
I suppose this is where we part.

492
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,164
Good luck, LaDonna.

493
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,766
Do not forget to turn on

494
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,502
your earpieces.

495
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,704
We'll await your guidance
to find Mildred and Noah.

496
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:07,614
Medical staff must have
identification at all times.

497
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:17,524
We'll wait here for
Miss LaDonna's instructions.

498
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:31,037
Okay.

499
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:34,473
It's the same.

500
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:36,709
It's the same.

501
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,745
This place.

502
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:40,446
The walls.

503
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,648
The restraints.

504
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,286
Nothing's changed.

505
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:49,789
Hayden?

506
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:51,290
Hayden, please.

507
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:54,426
I need you to stay with me now.

508
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:57,730
I was in a place...
like Ypsi Med.

509
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,766
I was put there by relatives

510
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:02,334
after my mom died.

511
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:05,504
She was only supposed
to be gone a week.

512
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,843
Every night I went
to sleep there...

513
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:14,814
I heard the screams of others.

514
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:17,516
I tried not to scream.

515
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:21,654
I was already in pain...
from the tests.

516
00:25:21,788 --> 00:25:24,691
The endless tests.

517
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,126
Hayden.

518
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,494
Hayden,

519
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:31,430
where are we?

520
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:35,034
Ypsi Med. Indeed.

521
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,369
You're not in the sanitorium.

522
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,807
The only reason
I'm not still there...

523
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,843
is because the green zap
saved me.

524
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:48,114
I won't argue with you.
This place is repugnant.

525
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:51,483
And that is why
we are here to save them.

526
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:53,786
Mildred and Noah.

527
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,722
Yes, Mildred and Noah.

528
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:57,824
Now, come back.

529
00:25:57,957 --> 00:25:59,992
Hey, as the leader
of this mission,

530
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:02,028
they need you focused.

531
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:09,836
Okay, the map is acquired.
I repeat: The map is acquired.

532
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:11,638
You ready?

533
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:12,738
Guys?

534
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,641
Are you ready?

535
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,744
We're ready.

536
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,950
License and registration,
please.

537
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:00,586
Uh, can I ask why?

538
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,188
Your tags are expired.

539
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:06,926
I-I'm sorry.

540
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,695
Can I make a phone call?

541
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:13,700
- Hang a left.
- Copy.

542
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,868
Did you find any documentation
on that computer?

543
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,536
Yeah, I'm on it.

544
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,238
Better grab whatever I can.

545
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,116
After one too many Twitter
arguments, your girl knows

546
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,375
to always keep her receipts
at the ready.

547
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,215
We can't go this way.

548
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,983
Why? The coast is clear.

549
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:32,985
Not for long.

550
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,596
We need a new route.

551
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,242
Okay, if you turn around
and make that right,

552
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:48,735
that hallway
will take you around

553
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,269
to the far end
of Mildred's block.

554
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,306
It seems the restraints
are targeted.

555
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,708
Designed to neutralize
our abilities.

556
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:32,211
None of them should be here.

557
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,714
Okay,

558
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:37,049
once you make that turn,

559
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:39,385
it'll take you
right to Mildred's room.

560
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:44,223
There are two bullyboys
blocking our path.

561
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:47,026
What is going on?

562
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,328
Are you clear?

563
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,729
Doc, can you hear me?

564
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:52,331
E must have lost Miss LaDonna. W.

565
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:53,532
Hey.

566
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,134
I have an idea.

567
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,003
A birdcall.

568
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:58,871
That can't work.

569
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:00,725
Men were always surprised
how well it worked

570
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,908
in World War II.

571
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,343
Sometimes simple solutions
are best.

572
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:08,915
Birdlady acting up again.

573
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:10,649
Let's check it out.

574
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,559
Let me go. Let go of me.
Mildred.

575
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,929
Don't touch me! Let me go!
Hayden, Hayden.

576
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:24,363
You have to calm down.

577
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:25,898
We are not prepared

578
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:27,333
for a frontal assault.

579
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,077
I will tear them apart
myself if I have to.

580
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,170
Now let me go.

581
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,271
Stop right there.

582
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:39,445
Injection gun. Now.

583
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,218
Um, ma'am,

584
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:48,312
we need to escort number
48 to the operating room.

585
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:51,223
You're to, uh, go aid intake

586
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:53,359
on the new one
that just arrived.

587
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,027
They'll fill you in
on the details.

588
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:58,029
Oh, my God, go.

589
00:29:58,097 --> 00:29:59,231
Now.

590
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:01,433
Let me go!

591
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:02,935
They're gone. They're gone.

592
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,883
Okay, so not a single thanks
for totally saving your lives?

593
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:08,941
Thank you, LaDonna.

594
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:10,075
LaDonna?

595
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,278
Hayden, is it really you? Yes.

596
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:14,480
And me. We're all here for you.

597
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:20,920
Hey, you're safe.

598
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,253
Okay, we're gonna go save Noah

599
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:23,422
and get out of here.

600
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:32,431
What the hell?

601
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:44,076
Mildred, what are you doing?

602
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,312
Showing him what
it's like to feel powerless.

603
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:51,984
Put him down.

604
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:54,853
The-the human body isn't
meant to take such trauma.

605
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:57,756
Sure it is.
He just has to push himself.

606
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,625
That's what they told us.

607
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,078
I'm sorry, but we had to stop
little Carrie here

608
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,635
before she killed him.

609
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:11,971
Did she? Um, kill him?

610
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,772
His ligaments must be shredded.

611
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,976
And his bones...

612
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,478
Shattered.

613
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:32,691
Okay, Andre,

614
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:33,824
we have to go... now.

615
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,361
But Noah. There's no time.

616
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,405
Come on! Go, go, go.

617
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,547
Um, where's our ride?

618
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:57,549
Could Miss Mariah
have abandoned the mission?

619
00:31:57,683 --> 00:31:58,985
Hey.

620
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,653
Jess, I thought
we were gonna meet

621
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,055
in your office.

622
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,759
Hey... Keish.

623
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,897
Andre? What the
hell is going on?

624
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:19,605
Oh, my God, this is a nightmare.

625
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:21,673
LaDonna?

626
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:25,011
Just get in. We...

627
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:27,846
Please.

628
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,884
Just go.

629
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,797
A thank-you to Sister Shanice

630
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,899
for livestreaming our church
to the world.

631
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:52,304
Since we've arrived here,
we have had cause to worship.

632
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:55,407
Facing trials put forth
by hateful men

633
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:57,143
and doubting spirits,
we have conquered

634
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:58,744
more than most.

635
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:02,048
Bound by our unique
circumstances, we have all

636
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,982
learned to embrace
the illustrious spirit

637
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:05,584
of our fellows.

638
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,619
So I say to you all,

639
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:09,621
let unity be our doctrine

640
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:11,557
and love our discipline.

641
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:15,727
But I leave you
with one final message,

642
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,329
both to those 4,400

643
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:20,266
beyond these walls
and to the world at large.

644
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:25,237
We, the 4,400,

645
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,005
have been chosen by God.

646
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,843
Ferried by his divine splendor
across the seas of time...

647
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,312
I swear... for a cause

648
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:34,746
bigger than all of us.

649
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,815
Let this hotel be a refuge...

650
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:40,252
Nay, a home... for all 4,400

651
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,589
that wish to be united
with their brothers and sisters.

652
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:46,325
And let it be known
that I will provide

653
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:49,161
for every 4,400
that comes to me.

654
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:51,430
The government has no latitude

655
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,366
to expel you
from this sanctuary.

656
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,338
We have not just God
but the law on our side.

657
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:01,940
While those who seek
to harm and divide us

658
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,543
shall be met with the full force
of the strength

659
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:09,014
that God Almighty
has imparted onto us.

660
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:17,856
So, I haven't been to church
in a while,

661
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,192
but that seemed kind of ominous.

662
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:23,495
Well, Rev has a flair
for the dramatics.

663
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:25,997
Where's Keisha?

664
00:34:26,132 --> 00:34:28,634
Well, believe it or not,
she's on her way to Ypsi Med

665
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,969
to check on Mildred and Noah.

666
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,044
All right, you got her?

667
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:40,346
Logan?

668
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:41,313
Mariah?

669
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,048
What is going on?

670
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:45,317
It's a long story. Andre,

671
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,017
did you know Mariah
was involved in this?

672
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,157
How could you?
Don't get mad at him.

673
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:52,724
Okay? All of this was my idea.

674
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:54,569
Now, say whatever you
have to say, but please

675
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:55,994
let us get Mildred inside.

676
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,397
Where's Noah?

677
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,599
There was no time.

678
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:02,901
Okay, well,
is Mildred gonna be okay?

679
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,770
I hope so.

680
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:08,039
Me, too. But, Hayden, how dare
you endanger Mariah like this?

681
00:35:08,174 --> 00:35:09,608
Did you honestly think through

682
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,042
what could have happened?

683
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:12,487
She could have gotten arrested,
or worse.

684
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:13,855
Okay, that-that's enough.
We all know

685
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:15,223
what could have happened,
but it didn't.

686
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:16,782
Because Mariah,

687
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:18,717
at the first sight of trouble,
called me,

688
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,085
like I raised her to do.

689
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:21,887
And don't worry,
Mariah's gonna be

690
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,889
very grounded once I have
a long chat with her.

691
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:25,724
Oh, a chat? Well, how stern.

692
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:26,857
Shanice, stop it.

693
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:28,059
You do not get a say

694
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:30,196
in how I raise or
discipline Mariah.

695
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:32,698
Logan, it was dangerous.

696
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,032
Hayden is from the 1930s.

697
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,534
He doesn't know anything

698
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,769
about this world...
They could have gotten hurt.

699
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:40,606
You know, I've gotten to know
a courteous...

700
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,241
and kind...

701
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:44,576
and obviously very
loyal young man.

702
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,278
And while he's
also very grounded,

703
00:35:46,412 --> 00:35:48,280
I'm proud to know
that Mariah has a friend

704
00:35:48,414 --> 00:35:49,915
who's willing to do
the right thing

705
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:51,583
for those he cares about.

706
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:54,220
Now, go check on her.
I'll be waiting in the car.

707
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,068
It's so great
to finally meet you.

708
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,771
I had a blast getting to be
an almost-getaway driver.

709
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,073
I'm glad you had fun
while I suffered.

710
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:20,446
No, I-I'm so sorry. I...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean

711
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,180
to snap at you.

712
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:25,751
It was just really hard
in there.

713
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,752
Do you...

714
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:30,121
want to talk about it?

715
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,259
Not now.

716
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,527
Maybe never.

717
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:37,363
Anyways,

718
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:39,030
thank you.

719
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:40,866
Thanks for taking
care of Hayden.

720
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:42,668
Oh, I was... I was...

721
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,936
I wasn't really much of a help.
I mean,

722
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,938
I mean, Hayden is
the absolute badass here.

723
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,509
That's what I always tell him.

724
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,678
He is...

725
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:55,013
more than capable
of standing on his own.

726
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,715
Right?

727
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,956
Nice show you put on earlier.

728
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,826
I hope it served its purpose
to provide a sanctuary.

729
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,828
But it wasn't for show.

730
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,363
I mean what I say.

731
00:37:11,497 --> 00:37:14,733
I'd rather break my back
than abandon my people.

732
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,969
I'm not interrupting anything,
am I?

733
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,806
You're not.
We were just finishing up.

734
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,541
How can we help, Mr. Greene?

735
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:23,985
I've been meaning to speak
with you since your sermon.

736
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:25,977
Seeing as you are
the man to know,

737
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,579
I figured we could talk
about how we

738
00:37:27,713 --> 00:37:28,753
could best aid each other.

739
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:31,182
I'm all ears. Wonderful.

740
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:32,418
Wonderful. Please.

741
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:34,019
Ms. Murray.

742
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:42,728
Do you know
how many things I've done

743
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:44,706
that could blow back on me,
personally and professionally,

744
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,770
for trying to cover for you?
What were you thinking,

745
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:49,234
breaking into Ypsi Med?
You could have been caught.

746
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:51,337
We deserve an explanation
right now.

747
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:53,548
And we need to come up with a
game plan to keep you all safe.

748
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:55,049
Keep the government from
finding out about your powers.

749
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:57,743
They already know.

750
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:00,879
They had specialized cells

751
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,514
used alongside other tactics

752
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,450
to impede whatever powers
someone had.

753
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,284
Mildred had a hood pressed
over her face

754
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:07,953
so she couldn't use hers.

755
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:10,206
No, that can't be right.
Jessica hasn't said anything,

756
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,928
and she works there.
Are you feeling okay?

757
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:15,093
No, we have
to be missing something.

758
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,128
Now, the government

759
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:19,465
appears to have some sort
of plan beyond freeing us.

760
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:20,932
You guys are on the inside.

761
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,601
You can help us.

762
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:25,804
So let's all set our minds
to solving this puzzle.

763
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:27,906
Together.

764
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:39,385
Glare

765
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:40,619
all you want.

766
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,588
While you're staying
under my roof,

767
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:44,065
I'm gonna learn you
some real discipline.

768
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:46,291
Don't mind your uncle.

769
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:48,960
I'll be back faster than
one of your chess games.

770
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:51,262
But-but I don't want you
to leave at all.

771
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:52,163
I-I need you.

772
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:53,499
I'm not leaving forever,

773
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:54,633
only for a week.

774
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,568
Even if I was,

775
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,945
I'm not worried about you
at all.

776
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:58,970
Do you want to know why?

777
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:00,939
Why?

778
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,074
Because you have all the tools

779
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,777
to be on your own and succeed.

780
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:26,891
Should have figured
you'd catch me.

781
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,034
Don't try to stop me.

782
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,436
I... I wasn't thinking of it.

783
00:39:31,437 --> 00:39:34,473
You can't follow me, either.
I have to do this

784
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:35,774
on my own. I know.

785
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,943
That's why I brought you this.

786
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:40,846
How did you know?

787
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:45,050
Look, when I started this,

788
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:46,818
I just wanted
to bring you back to me.

789
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:49,320
I didn't think I could
stand on my own.

790
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:52,157
I missed how you
made me feel safe.

791
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,894
So you planned that whole thing.

792
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,295
I kind of did, huh?

793
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,397
Look, if I try to keep you here,

794
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:02,400
it'd be for my needs, not yours.

795
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:05,203
So please.

796
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:06,672
Will you be okay?

797
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:12,878
I have all the tools I need
to be on my own and succeed.

798
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:21,587
Can you tell me if you see it?

799
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,722
Do I save her?

800
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:35,066
It's this way. Let's go.

801
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:40,572
I...

802
00:40:40,706 --> 00:40:42,440
I-I don't know.

803
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:44,175
I can't see anything.

804
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,878
Just be careful.

805
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:49,080
I will.
