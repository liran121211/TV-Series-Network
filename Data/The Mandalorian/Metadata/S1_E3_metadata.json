At the Covert underground lair, the other Mandalorian bounty hunters express their disdain with consorting with \"the enemy,\" in reference to the \"Great Purge\" where many Mandalorians, including Mando's family, were systematically killed (a la Order 66). They have since lived in hiding, appearing one at a time so as not to reveal their numbers. Now that Mando is the most sought bounty hunter in the parsecs, their presence will be even less. However, since Mando did not violate the code, he has done no wrong and is therefore not dishonoring them."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "9121534", "rating": 8.9, "votes": 32000, "number_of_episodes": 25}
