1
00:00:01,767 --> 00:00:04,329
- What's your highest bounty?
- There is one job.

2
00:00:04,353 --> 00:00:06,957
- Underworld?
- Deep pocket.

3
00:00:06,981 --> 00:00:10,043
Greef Karga said you were the best
in the parsec.

4
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:15,884
I have a camtono of Beskar waiting for you
upon delivery of the asset.

5
00:00:18,242 --> 00:00:20,049
You are Mandalorian!

6
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:21,878
I will help you.

7
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,135
Many have passed through.

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,677
They seek the same one.

9
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:29,730
IG Unit! Stand down.

10
00:00:29,754 --> 00:00:31,273
You are a Guild member?

11
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,275
I have a suggestion.
We split the reward.

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,726
This is acceptable.

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,517
The tracking fob is still active.

14
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,026
There is a life form present.

15
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:10,109
I thought you were dead.

16
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:31,178
This is what was causing all the fuss?

17
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,727
I think it's a child.

18
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:36,388
It is better to deliver it alive then.

19
00:11:36,671 --> 00:11:39,858
My ship
has been destroyed. I'm trapped here.

20
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:42,599
Stripped. Not destroyed.

21
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:47,616
The Jawas steal. They don't destroy.

22
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,067
Stolen or destroyed,
makes no difference to me.

23
00:11:53,354 --> 00:11:55,707
They're protected
by their crawling fortress.

24
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:58,335
There's no way to recover the parts.

25
00:11:58,359 --> 00:11:59,878
You can trade.

26
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:02,422
With Jawas?
Are you out of your mind?

27
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:04,043
I will take you to them.

28
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,044
I have spoken.

29
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:11,342
Hey! Spit that out.

30
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,196
They really don't like you
for some reason.

31
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,147
Well, I did disintegrate a few of them.

32
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:19,458
You need to drop your rifle.

33
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:22,628
I'm a Mandalorian.
Weapons are part of my religion.

34
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:24,959
Then you are not getting your parts back.

35
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:29,670
Fine.

36
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:41,928
And the blaster.

37
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:47,736
Good day.

38
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:15,639
They will trade all the parts
for the beskar.

39
00:14:15,663 --> 00:14:18,183
I'm not gonna trade anything.
These are my parts.

40
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:19,560
They stole them from me.

41
00:14:28,593 --> 00:14:30,404
- You understand this?
- No!

42
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:33,325
Whoa. Easy, easy.

43
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:45,663
Get away from it!

44
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,100
The egg? What egg?

45
00:22:09,846 --> 00:22:11,233
Mando!

46
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:15,244
I have it.

47
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:16,615
I've got the egg.

48
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,166
I'm surprised you waited.

49
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:13,750
I'm surprised you took so long.

50
00:23:30,968 --> 00:23:33,235
Is it still sleeping?

51
00:23:35,973 --> 00:23:37,280
Yes.

52
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:43,165
Was it injured?

53
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:46,656
I don't think so.
Not physically.

54
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:49,464
Explain it to me again.

55
00:23:50,112 --> 00:23:52,959
I still don't understand what happened.

56
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:55,712
Neither do I.

57
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:07,019
There's no way we're gonna get this to
work without a full maintenance facility.

58
00:24:07,296 --> 00:24:09,063
This is gonna take days to fix.

59
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:12,436
If you care to help, it might go faster.

60
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:17,699
There is much work to do.

61
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:27,978
I can't thank you enough.

62
00:25:28,002 --> 00:25:30,309
Please allow me to give you
a portion of the reward.

63
00:25:31,047 --> 00:25:32,941
I cannot accept.

64
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:37,312
You are my guest
and I am therefore in your service.

65
00:25:40,932 --> 00:25:45,409
I could use a crew member of your ability,
and I can pay handsomely.

66
00:25:46,604 --> 00:25:47,790
I am honored,

67
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:52,252
but I have worked a lifetime
to finally be free of servitude.

68
00:25:52,276 --> 00:25:56,048
I understand.
Then all I can offer is my thanks.

69
00:25:56,072 --> 00:25:57,709
And I offer mine.

70
00:25:57,949 --> 00:26:00,706
Thank you for bringing peace to my valley.

71
00:26:15,883 --> 00:26:18,403
And good luck with The Child.

72
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:21,864
May it survive and bring you
a handsome reward.

73
00:26:23,474 --> 00:26:24,781
I have spoken.
