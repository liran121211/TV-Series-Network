THE MANDALORIAN: Unless I'm mistaken,

366
00:30:18,924 --> 00:30:20,999
you are, as of yet, empty-handed.

367
00:30:21,002 --> 00:30:22,585
This is true.

368
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,656
- THE MANDALORIAN: I have a suggestion.
- Proceed.

369
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:26,585
THE MANDALORIAN: We split the reward.

370
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:28,367
This is acceptable.

371
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,414
Great. Now let's regroup, out
of harm's way, and form a plan.

372
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:35,155
IG-11: I will of course
receive the reputation merits

373
00:30:35,158 --> 00:30:36,876
associated with the mission.

374
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:38,463
Can we talk about this later?

375
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:43,091
I require an answer
if I am to proceed...

376
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:45,262
IG-11: Oh, no. Alert. Alert. Alert.

IG-11: It appears we are trapped.

392
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,164
I will initiate self-destruct sequencing.

393
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:59,114
THE MANDALORIAN: Whoa, you're what?

394
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:02,336
IG-11: Manufacturers Protocol
dictates I cannot be captured.

395
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:05,858
- I must self-destruct.
- Do not self-destruct.

396
00:32:05,861 --> 00:32:07,177

Go! Go! There's too many!

00:32:35,978 --> 00:32:37,460
THE MANDALORIAN: They got us pinned.

(NIKTO LAUGHS)

402
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:45,280
I will initiate self-destruct.

403

Do not self-destruct!
We're shooting our way out.

404
00:32:52,264 --> 00:32:53,307
THE MANDALORIAN: Okay.

405
00:32:55,368 --> 00:32:56,717
THE MANDALORIAN: New plan!

406

413
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:47,895
I will disengage self-destruct initiative.

You know, you're not so bad.

415

- For a droid.
- IG-11: Agreed.

hit looks nasty. You okay?

IG-11: Yes.
