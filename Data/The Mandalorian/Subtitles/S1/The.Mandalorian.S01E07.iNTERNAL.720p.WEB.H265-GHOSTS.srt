1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:02,921
You were hired to do a job. So do it.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,132
Isn't that your code?

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,796
Aren't you a man of honor?

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,139
IG Unit! Stand down.

5
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:17,178
You are a Guild member?

6
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:19,593
I have a suggestion.
We split the reward.

7
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:25,524
I could use a crew
member of your ability.

8
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,783
I am honored, but I have worked a

9
00:00:27,786 --> 00:00:30,570
lifetime to finally
be free of servitude.

10
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,198
Then all I can offer is my thanks.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,859
And I offer mine.

12
00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:37,446
Thank you for bringing
peace to my valley.

13
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:40,163
I saw most of my action
cleaning up after Endor.

14
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,209
Mostly Ex-Imperial warlords.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,809
Such a large bounty for
such a small package.

16
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:48,102
What they're gonna do with it?

17
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:49,913
I didn't ask.

18
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,718
It's against the Guild Code.

19
00:01:44,499 --> 00:01:47,647
My friend, if you are
receiving this transmission,

20
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,257
that means you are alive.

21
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,748
You might be surprised to
hear this, but I am alive too.

22
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:56,450
I guess we can call it even.

23
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,493
A lot has happened since
we last saw each other.

24
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,070
The man who hired you is still here,

25
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:07,017
and his ranks of ex-Imperial
guards have grown.

26
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,387
They have imposed
despotic rule over my city,

27
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,585
which has impeded the
livelihood of the Guild.

28
00:02:13,588 --> 00:02:15,217
We consider him an enemy,

29
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,418
but we cannot get close
enough to take him out.

30
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:21,199
If you would consider
one last commission,

31
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:24,501
I will very much make
it worth your while.

32
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:28,714
You have been successful so far
in staving off their hunters,

33
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:31,845
but they will not stop
until they have their prize.

34
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:34,803
So, here is my proposition.

35
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:38,807
Return to Nevarro.
Bring the child as bait.

36
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:40,368
I will arrange an exchange,

37
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:43,676
and provide loyal Guild
members as protection.

38
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:45,956
Once we get near the client,

39
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,163
you kill him, and we
both get what we want.

40
00:02:49,987 --> 00:02:52,779
If you succeed, you keep the child

41
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:55,824
and I will have your name
cleared with the Guild,

42
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:59,661
for a man of honor should not
be forced to live in exile.

43
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:02,249
I await your arrival with optimism.

45
00:05:06,497 --> 00:05:08,581
Pay up, mudscuffers!

46
00:05:08,584 --> 00:05:11,086
Come on. That's mine, thank you.

47
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,173
All right, thank you.

48
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:17,617
Looking for some work?

49
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,437
It seems like a
straightforward operation.

50
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:32,773
They're providing the plan
and firepower. I'm the snare.

51
00:05:32,775 --> 00:05:35,108
- With the kid?
- That's why I'm coming to you.

52
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,707
I don't know. I've
been advised to lay low.

53
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,281
If anybody runs my chain code,

54
00:05:39,284 --> 00:05:41,114
I'll rot in a cell
for he rest of my life.

55
00:05:41,116 --> 00:05:43,077
I thought you were a veteran.

56
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:45,079
Come back soon.

57
00:05:46,872 --> 00:05:50,332
I've been a lot of things since.
Most of them carry a life sentence.

58
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:52,022
If I so much as book passage on a ship

59
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:53,710
registered to the New Republic, I'm...

60
00:05:53,712 --> 00:05:56,171
I have a ship. I can
bring you there and back

61
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:57,756
with a handsome reward.

62
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,257
You can live free of worry.

63
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,218
I'm already free of worry,

64
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,678
and I'm not in the mood
to play soldier anymore.

65
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,056
Especially fighting some local warlord.

66
00:06:06,058 --> 00:06:08,183
He's not a local warlord.

67
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:09,499
He's Imperial.

68
00:06:13,357 --> 00:06:14,441
I'm in.

69
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,531
Does your contact need to vet me?

70
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:24,658
Doesn't know you're coming.

71
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,660
Really? That could be a problem.

72
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:28,036
It won't.

73
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:30,707
But if it is, that's his problem.

74
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,631
He all right up there alone?

75
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,550
Yeah.

76
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:43,053
Pick one.

77
00:06:47,724 --> 00:06:48,932
You trust the contact?

78
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:50,294
Not particularly.

79
00:06:51,854 --> 00:06:55,274
He and I had a run-in last time I
was there on some Guild business.

80
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:58,171
So then why are we going?

81
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,069
I don't have a choice.

82
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:02,781
You saw what happened on Sorgan.

83
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,949
They'll keep sending hunters.

84
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:08,370
The kid will never be
safe until the Imp is dead.

85
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,789
And you're okay with
bringing him back there?

86
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,820
Not really. That's why I'm bringing you.

87
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:47,827
We need someone to watch that thing.

88
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,076
Yeah.

89
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:51,286
You got anyone you can trust?

90
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:22,236
Whoa! Easy. Whoa!

91
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:44,343
It hasn't grown much.

92
00:08:44,346 --> 00:08:46,466
I think it might be a Strand-Cast.

93
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:49,052
I don't think it was engineered.

94
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:51,304
I've worked in the gene farms.

95
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:54,891
This one looks evolved. Too ugly.

96
00:08:54,893 --> 00:08:56,785
This one, on the other hand,

97
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:01,148
looks like she was farmed
in the Cytocaves of Nora.

98
00:09:01,151 --> 00:09:03,998
This is Cara Dune. She
was a shock trooper.

99
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,294
You were a Dropper?

100
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,530
Did you serve?

101
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:11,158
On the other side, I'm afraid.

102
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,162
But I'm proud to say that
I paid out my clan's debt,

103
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:18,125
and now I serve no one but myself.

104
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:24,312
Would anyone care for some tea?

105
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,679
Please lower your blasters.
He will not harm you.

106
00:09:28,682 --> 00:09:31,594
That thing is programmed
to kill the baby.

107
00:09:31,597 --> 00:09:32,890
Not anymore.

108
00:09:38,854 --> 00:09:42,733
It was left behind in the
wake of your destruction.

109
00:09:48,113 --> 00:09:51,992
I found it laying where it fell.

110
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:01,126
Devoid of all life.

111
00:10:05,506 --> 00:10:09,674
I recovered the flotsam
and staked it as my own

112
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:13,054
in accordance with the
Charter of the New Republic.

113
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,853
Little remained of its neural harness.

114
00:10:23,273 --> 00:10:26,652
Reconstruction was quite difficult...

115
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,280
...but not impossible.

116
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,495
It had to learn everything from scratch.

117
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:41,834
This is something that cannot be
taught with the twist of a spanner.

118
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:47,585
It requires patience and repetition.

119
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:59,975
I spent day after day
reinforcing its development

120
00:10:59,977 --> 00:11:03,981
with patience and affirmation.

121
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:12,072
It developed a personality
as its experiences grew.

122
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:38,013
Is it still a hunter?

123
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:40,309
No. But it will protect.

124
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:51,195
Tea?

125
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:01,789
I've run into some problems.

126
00:12:02,414 --> 00:12:06,085
I figured as much. Why
else would you return?

127
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:08,960
I wanna hire your services.

128
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,254
I'm retired from service.

129
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:13,006
I can pay you handsomely, Ugnaught.

130
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:17,803
I have a name. It is Kuiil.

131
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:21,181
I need someone to protect
the little one, Kuiil.

132
00:12:21,183 --> 00:12:23,227
I'm not suited for such work.

133
00:12:24,061 --> 00:12:27,970
I can reprogram IG-11
for nursing and protocol.

134
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:28,989
No.

135
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:31,608
I don't want that
droid anywhere near him.

136
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,382
Why're you so distrustful of droids?

137
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:35,946
It tried to kill him.

138
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:37,699
It was programmed to do so.

139
00:12:38,575 --> 00:12:41,076
Droids are not good or bad.

140
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:45,288
They are neutral reflections
of those who imprint them.

141
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,124
I've seen otherwise.

142
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:48,834
Do you trust me?

143
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:51,211
From what I can tell, yes.

144
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:53,632
Then you will trust my work.

145
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,677
IG-11 will join me.

146
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,720
And we do it not for payment,

147
00:13:00,722 --> 00:13:04,891
but to protect the child
from Imperial slavery.

148
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:10,274
None will be free until the
old ways are gone forever.

149
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,277
Okay.

150
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:17,611
And the blurrgs will join me as well.

151
00:13:17,614 --> 00:13:18,780
The blurrgs?

152
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:20,159
I have spoken.

153
00:13:45,517 --> 00:13:47,148
I got you, Mando.

154
00:13:47,151 --> 00:13:50,148
Care to double the bet?

155
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:07,954
No! No, no! Stop!

156
00:14:07,956 --> 00:14:10,415
We're friends, we're
friends. Cara is my friend!

157
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:11,708
That is not okay!

158
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,410
Hmm. Very curious.

159
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:15,864
Curious? It almost killed me!

160
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:20,757
The story you told me of the
mudhorn now makes more sense.

161
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,929
- What is it?
- What it is, I don't know.

162
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,531
But what it does, this...

163
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,308
This I've heard rumors of.

164
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,602
What? When you worked for the Empire?

165
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:35,440
When I was sold to the Empire,
in indentured servitude.

166
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,992
Yet somehow, you walk free.

167
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:41,277
I bought my freedom through
the skill of my hands

168
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,741
and the labor of three
of your human lifetimes.

169
00:14:45,744 --> 00:14:52,292
Do not cast doubt upon that of
what I am nor whom I shall serve.

170
00:14:57,071 --> 00:14:59,404
Tell you what. I could really use

171
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:01,799
your craftwork right now.

172
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:04,928
Can you pad this container
so the child can sleep better?

173
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,765
I shall fabricate a better one.

174
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:12,644
Then perhaps this Dropper can
see how one can win their freedom

175
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:15,441
with the skill of one's hands.

176
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:29,116
So, we're going to Nevarro?

177
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:31,325
- Have you ever been?
- No.

178
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:33,167
We lost a lot of our forces there.

179
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:35,792
The city's dug in pretty deep.

180
00:15:35,794 --> 00:15:37,337
No cover when you drop in.

181
00:15:39,256 --> 00:15:41,798
It stayed in Empire control
'till the end of the war.

182
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,509
The warlord we're taking
out was an Imperial officer.

183
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:46,678
- What station?
- Hard to tell.

184
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,263
No insignia anymore.

185
00:15:48,265 --> 00:15:50,849
I took out the safehouse
when I snatched the kid.

186
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:53,203
More Imps have reinforced since.

187
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:55,195
There's something more going on.

188
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,025
Maybe. We'll find out more when we land.

189
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:01,397
I have prepared second meal.

190
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,783
Would you care to be
served here or below?

191
00:16:05,491 --> 00:16:07,159
I'm not hungry.

192
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,579
Under no circumstances does
that thing leave the ship.

193
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:15,212
You got a real thing
for droids, don't you?

194
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:17,465
I got a real thing for that droid.

195
00:16:17,468 --> 00:16:19,336
The Ugnaught said he rewired it.

196
00:16:19,338 --> 00:16:21,505
That droid was designed to kill things.

197
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:24,007
I don't care how much
wiring he replaced.

198
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:25,765
It goes against its nature.

199
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:27,637
Well, it shouldn't be a long job anyway.

200
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,516
We take out the head Imp,
the rest will run like rats.

201
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:26,278
Sorry for the remote rendezvous, Mando,

202
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,534
but things have gotten complicated
since you were last here.

203
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:38,296
It appears that
introductions are in order.

204
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:43,338
It seems we've both
provided a security detail.

205
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:49,634
I recommend the shock
trooper guards the ship.

206
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:52,721
These lava fields are lousy with Jawas.

207
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:54,243
She's coming with me.

208
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,726
But the town is now run by ex-Empire.

209
00:17:57,728 --> 00:18:01,772
If a Rebel Dropper is with us,
they'll all get their hackles up.

210
00:18:01,774 --> 00:18:02,974
She's coming.

211
00:18:04,812 --> 00:18:05,986
Fine.

212
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,231
Fine.

213
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:12,070
At least cover your tattoo.

214
00:18:12,073 --> 00:18:13,325
No need to flaunt it.

215
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:16,663
Now, where is the little one?

216
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:36,517
So, this little bogwing is
what all the fuss was about.

217
00:18:40,354 --> 00:18:42,979
What a precious little creature.

218
00:18:42,982 --> 00:18:44,875
I can see why you didn't want to harm

219
00:18:44,878 --> 00:18:47,321
a hair on its wrinkled little head.

220
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:56,310
Well, I'm glad this matter will
be put to rest once and for all.

221
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,417
The sun drops fast on Nevarro.

222
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,336
We can walk for a spell,
camp out at the riverbank,

223
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:09,258
then make our way into
town at first light.

224
00:20:06,064 --> 00:20:09,107
I guess the little bugger's a carnivore.

225
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:11,151
Never seen anything like it.

226
00:20:11,153 --> 00:20:14,154
They were ready to pay a
king's ransom for that thing.

227
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:17,868
Must be for some kind
of highfalutin menagerie.

228
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,952
Let's go over the plan again.

229
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:23,246
We both enter the common house.

230
00:20:23,248 --> 00:20:25,123
We show the client the bait.

231
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,293
We join him at the
table. And you kill him.

232
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:30,378
Tell me about his reinforcements.

233
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,589
They're all ex-Empire.

234
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:36,051
As soon as they lose their
paycheck, poof, they'll all scatter.

235
00:20:36,053 --> 00:20:38,512
- And what if they don't?
- They will.

236
00:20:38,514 --> 00:20:40,292
That's not good enough.

237
00:20:40,295 --> 00:20:43,433
If, for argument's sake,
a few of them don't realize

238
00:20:43,435 --> 00:20:46,478
that I'm their best path
to alternative employment

239
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,076
and they elect to react impulsively,

240
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:51,983
then these three fine Guild Hunters,

241
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:54,615
along with that
battle-hardened shock trooper,

242
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:57,280
will cut down anyone who bucks.

243
00:20:57,282 --> 00:20:58,882
How many will there be?

244
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:02,619
No more than four.

245
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:06,915
He travels with, at most, a Fire Team.

246
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,001
Trust me.

247
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:10,943
Nothing can go wrong.

248
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:37,863
No! Let go of her!

249
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:40,659
Drop her now!

250
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:52,344
Drop her!

251
00:22:33,504 --> 00:22:34,586
He's hurt badly.

252
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:38,173
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine. Ow!

253
00:22:38,175 --> 00:22:39,176
Hold still.

254
00:22:41,076 --> 00:22:42,262
They got you good.

255
00:22:49,263 --> 00:22:50,437
How bad?

256
00:22:51,313 --> 00:22:52,395
Bad.

257
00:22:52,397 --> 00:22:53,816
The poison's spreading fast.

258
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,779
So this... This is how it happens.

259
00:22:59,738 --> 00:23:01,113
Don't be so dramatic.

260
00:23:01,115 --> 00:23:04,034
I need another medpac!
Got any other medpacs?

261
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:05,744
Anyone?

262
00:23:07,996 --> 00:23:09,623
I'm guessing that's a "no".

263
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:13,794
It's still spreading.

264
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:16,130
This isn't working.

265
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:20,632
Get this thing outta here.

266
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:21,635
Wait.

267
00:23:24,888 --> 00:23:26,348
He's trying to eat me.

268
00:24:12,811 --> 00:24:14,897
You think they're
having second thoughts?

269
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:17,146
Could be.

270
00:24:18,317 --> 00:24:19,931
I need your eyes.

271
00:24:19,934 --> 00:24:21,195
I'm watching.

272
00:24:40,756 --> 00:24:42,091
I guess this is it.

273
00:24:53,435 --> 00:24:55,187
There's something you should know.

274
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:05,966
The plan was to kill
you and take the kid.

275
00:25:06,698 --> 00:25:10,364
But after what happened last night,
I couldn't go through with it.

276
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:15,096
Go on. You can gun me down here and now

277
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,706
and it wouldn't violate the Code.

278
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:19,459
But if you do, this
child will never be safe.

279
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:21,002
We'll take our chances.

280
00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:24,548
The Imperial client is obsessed
with obtaining this asset.

281
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,050
You tried to run, but
where did it get you?

282
00:25:27,052 --> 00:25:28,176
This is ridiculous.

283
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:30,512
Perhaps you should let him speak.

284
00:25:30,514 --> 00:25:33,557
Listen, we both need the
client to be eliminated.

285
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:36,268
Let me take the child to
him and then you two...

286
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:38,791
- No.
- Let's just kill him and get outta here.

287
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:42,186
He's right.

288
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:45,694
What are you doing?

289
00:25:45,696 --> 00:25:48,488
As long as the Imp lives, he'll
send hunters after the child.

290
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,656
It's a trap.

291
00:25:49,658 --> 00:25:51,491
- Bring me.
- Bring you?

292
00:25:51,493 --> 00:25:53,134
Tell him you captured me.

293
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,408
Get me close to him and I'll kill him.

294
00:25:56,123 --> 00:25:58,709
That's a good idea.
Give me your blaster.

295
00:25:59,877 --> 00:26:01,306
This is insane.

296
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,879
- It's the only way.
- Well, I'm coming with you.

297
00:26:03,881 --> 00:26:06,214
No, no, no. That would
make them suspicious.

298
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:08,133
I don't care. I'm coming.

299
00:26:08,135 --> 00:26:09,432
Tell them she caught me.

300
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,178
Fine. Then she can bring the child.

301
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,055
No. The kid goes back in the ship.

302
00:26:14,057 --> 00:26:16,016
But without the child,
none of this works!

303
00:26:16,018 --> 00:26:18,727
I have a plan. Kuiil, ride
back to the Razor Crest

304
00:26:18,729 --> 00:26:20,854
with the child and seal yourself in.

305
00:26:20,856 --> 00:26:23,607
When you're inside, engage
ground security protocols.

306
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:26,485
Nothing on this planet
will breach those doors.

307
00:26:26,487 --> 00:26:28,278
Here's a comlink.

308
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,532
I will keep the child safe.

309
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:33,867
Don't forget to cover your stripes.

310
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:34,995
Let's go.

311
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:36,557
Chain code?

312
00:27:37,683 --> 00:27:39,226
I have a gift for the boss.

313
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,562
Chain code?

314
00:27:56,951 --> 00:27:59,577
I'll give you 20 credits for the helmet.

315
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,750
Ha-ha! Not a chance.
That's going on my wall.

316
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:06,334
On your wall?

317
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:07,780
Go with it.

318
00:28:07,783 --> 00:28:09,173
Go ahead.

319
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:20,682
You said four.

320
00:28:20,684 --> 00:28:22,476
There are more than four troopers.

321
00:28:22,478 --> 00:28:26,521
Four guarding the client.
Many more here in town.

322
00:28:26,523 --> 00:28:31,943
Things got really heated once
Mando crashed the safehouse.

323
00:28:31,945 --> 00:28:33,697
Slip him his blaster.

324
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:35,749
Not yet.

325
00:28:56,595 --> 00:28:57,805
Here we are.

326
00:29:05,062 --> 00:29:06,897
You see? Four.

327
00:29:17,157 --> 00:29:20,119
Look what I brought you. As promised.

328
00:29:24,248 --> 00:29:27,283
What exquisite craftmanship.

329
00:29:30,712 --> 00:29:34,021
It is amazing how
beautiful beskar can be

330
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:37,353
when forged by its ancestral artisans.

331
00:29:39,138 --> 00:29:42,491
Can I offer you a libation to celebrate

332
00:29:42,494 --> 00:29:45,498
the closing of our shared narrative?

333
00:29:45,501 --> 00:29:47,187
I would be obliged.

334
00:29:51,861 --> 00:29:53,026
Please sit.

335
00:29:54,403 --> 00:29:59,114
It is a shame that
your people suffered so.

336
00:29:59,116 --> 00:30:03,228
Just as in this situation,
it was all avoidable.

337
00:30:03,787 --> 00:30:07,708
Why did Mandalore resist our expansion?

338
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:12,627
The Empire improves
every system it touches.

339
00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:14,838
Judge by any metric.

340
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,887
Safety, prosperity,
trade, opportunity, peace.

341
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:25,225
Compare Imperial rule
to what is happening now.

342
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:29,438
Look outside.

343
00:30:31,064 --> 00:30:34,985
Is the world more peaceful
since the revolution?

344
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:41,325
I see nothing but death and chaos.

345
00:30:42,951 --> 00:30:45,079
I would like to see the baby.

346
00:30:45,954 --> 00:30:47,454
Uh...

347
00:30:47,456 --> 00:30:48,955
It is asleep.

348
00:30:48,957 --> 00:30:50,918
We all will be quiet.

349
00:30:54,505 --> 00:30:56,131
Open the pram.

350
00:31:04,473 --> 00:31:09,269
Don't think me to be rude.
I must take this call.

351
00:31:19,071 --> 00:31:20,989
Give me the blaster.

352
00:31:21,865 --> 00:31:23,657
You get one shot.

353
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:26,203
This is bad. You said four.

354
00:31:27,204 --> 00:31:30,290
Well, there are more.
What can I tell you?

355
00:31:34,753 --> 00:31:37,045
Yes, Moff Gideon?

356
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:39,047
Have they brought the child?

357
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:42,719
Yes, they have.
Currently, it is sleeping.

358
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,222
You may wanna check again.

359
00:32:40,444 --> 00:32:41,987
Four stormtroopers?

360
00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:57,459
This is bad.

361
00:32:57,461 --> 00:32:59,423
Kuiil? Are you back to the ship yet?

362
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,090
Are you there? Do you copy?

363
00:33:03,092 --> 00:33:04,174
Yes!

364
00:33:04,176 --> 00:33:06,510
- Are you back to the ship yet?
- Not yet.

365
00:33:06,512 --> 00:33:09,221
Get back to the ship and
bail. Get the kid out of here.

366
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:11,056
We're pinned down!

367
00:34:33,098 --> 00:34:35,509
You have something I want.

368
00:34:36,268 --> 00:34:37,431
Who's this guy?

369
00:34:38,763 --> 00:34:42,806
You may think you have some idea
of what you are in possession of,

370
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:44,267
but you do not.

371
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:48,650
Kuiil, are you back to the
ship yet? They're onto us!

372
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:55,285
Kuiil, come in!

373
00:34:55,287 --> 00:34:59,790
In a few moments, it will be mine.

374
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,343
Kuiil! Do you copy?

375
00:35:09,923 --> 00:35:11,095
Kuiil!

376
00:35:12,502 --> 00:35:17,935
It means more to me
than you will ever know.

377
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:21,189
Kuiil! Are you there?

378
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,853
Come in, Kuiil.

379
00:35:22,856 --> 00:35:23,982
Kuiil, come in.

380
00:35:27,903 --> 00:35:30,080
Kuiil? Are you there?

381
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:31,448
Do you copy?

382
00:35:32,574 --> 00:35:33,806
Kuiil?

383
00:35:35,327 --> 00:35:36,541
Kuiil!
