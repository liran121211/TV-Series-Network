You get a better view.

66
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,098
All right, but here's the thing.
I can't get those coordinates

67
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,937
unless I have access
to an internal Imperial terminal.

68
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,901
I believe there's one on Morak.

69
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,355
THE MANDALORIAN: Morak?
There's nothing on Morak.

70
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,445
It's a secret Imperial mining hub, okay?

71
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:25,831

I can get you the coordinates.

punch in the coordinates to Morak.

This is what you're talkin' about, right?

76

Yeah, that's the refinery right there.

77
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Wonder what they're refining in there.

78
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:56,355
Looks like rhydonium.
Highly volatile and explosive.

Yeah, kinda like this one, huh.

protecting it.

gotta get me the hell out of there.

I'll drop in and pull you out.

86

All right. Mayfeld and I will swap out
for the drivers in the tunnel.

87

As much as I'd like to take a road trip
with Rebel-dropper here,

88
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,702
that's not gonna work.

89
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,319
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

90
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,655
Well, because these Remnant bases
are set up and run by ex-ISB.

91
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,163
If you get scanned
and your genetic signature

92
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,655
shows up on any New Republic register,

93
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,167
you're gonna be detected,
and it's guns out.

a lot about Imperial Remnants.

then just say it.

I'll trip the alarm, too.

99
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,555

they might recognize my face.

102
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,602

he'll tip 'em off. He'll be a hero.

I'm doin' you guys a favor.

Hey, buddy,
I might be good at fast-talking,

107
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,280
but I don't think I can explain away
a guy in a Mando suit to Imperial guards.

108
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,197
So, unless
you're gonna take off that helmet,

109
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,696
it's gonna be me goin' in alone.

VALIN HESS: Well, it's a small sacrifice
for the greater good, son.

339
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,612
Depends on who you ask, don't you think?

340
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,372
What you gettin' at, trooper?

341
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:18,406
All those people, the ones who died,

342
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,160
was it good for them?

343
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,879
Hmm? Their families?

344
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,460
The guys I served with?

345
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:32,676
Civilians, those poor mud scuffers,
died defendin' their homes,

346
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:35,391
fighting for freedom.

347
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:37,508
Was it good for 'em?

348
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:42,732
But we've outlasted them, son.

349
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:45,475
They're eatin' themselves alive.

350
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:50,648
The New Republic is in complete disarray,
and we grow stronger.

351
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:53,992
You see,
with the rhydonium you've delivered,

352
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:59,332
we can create havoc that's gonna make
Burnin Konn just pale by comparison.

353
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:02,754
And then they're gonna
turn to us once again.

354
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,760
You see, boys,
everybody thinks they want freedom,

355
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,890
but what they really want is order.

356
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:21,638
And when they realize that,

357
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:26,357
they're gonna welcome us back
with open arms.

358
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:31,859
Ah.
