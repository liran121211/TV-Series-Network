1
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:02,294
Have you ever removed your helmet?

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:03,378
No.

3
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:05,172
Has it ever been removed by others?

4
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,632
Never.

5
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:07,883
This is the Way.

6
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,426
This is the Way.

7
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,638
A Mandalorian covert is close.

8
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,223
The contact will lead you to them.

9
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,351
However, no hyperdrive.

10
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,811
Moving fast is the only thing
keeping me safe.

11
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,439
Razor Crest, stand down.
We will fire.

12
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,361
Hold on.

13
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:33,075
We're lucky if we
get off this frozen tomb with our lives.

14
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,702
Go, go, go! Back to the ship!

15
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,259
Am I under arrest?

16
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,177
Technically, you should be.

17
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,346
But these are trying times.

18
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,474
I'm gonna repair the cockpit enough
for us to limp to Trask.

19
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,352
There's nothing I can do
about the main hull's integrity,

20
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,563
so we're gonna have to get cozy
in the cockpit.

21
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,606
It's gonna be a long ride.

22
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,308
Looks like we made it.

23
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,143
Get ready for landing.

24
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,021
Dank farrik!

25
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:28,023
The landing array isn't responding.

26
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,401
Without the guidance system,
it'll be a manual re-entry.

27
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,653
It might get choppy.

28
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:38,075
Once we're through the atmosphere,
there should be enough fuel to slow down.

29
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,869
If we don't burn to a crisp.

30
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,388
Come up here. I need your hands!

31
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,603
This lever needs to stay back.
Can you do that?

32
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,107
Keep it steady. Here we go.

33
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,373
Razor Crest, this is Trask flight control.

34
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,584
Please reduce your speed to port protocol.

35
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,169
I'm trying my best here.

36
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,504
Engage reverse thrusters. Brace!

37
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,387
Hold on.

38
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,142
Razor Crest, do you copy?
You have to reduce speed.

39
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,227
Almost there, almost there.

40
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,021
Razor Crest, do you copy?

41
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,775
Razor Crest, you're coming in too fast.
You have to re...

42
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,660
Here we go. Nice and easy.

43
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,339
So, how can I help you?

44
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,216
Can you fix it?

45
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,386
Fix it? Nah.

46
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:03,887
But I can make it fly.

47
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,139
Do what you can.

48
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,477
I'll fuel it up.

49
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,272
If it still holds fuel.

50
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,496
I know you're hungry.

51
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,124
-We'll get you something to eat.

52
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,421
-You're welcome.

53
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,634
I was told you could lead me
to others of my kind.

54
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,140
The inn? Over there?

55
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:16,562
Thank you.

56
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:18,939
Have a seat over there.

57
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:24,987
What can I get you?

58
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,071
Nothing for me.

59
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,657
A bowl of chowder for my friend.

60
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,242
These seats are scarce, buddy.

61
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,494
Everyone seated needs to eat.

62
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,121
I can buy something else.

63
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:36,790
Information.

64
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,297
Have you seen others that look like me?

65
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,307
Others with beskar have been through here.

66
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,187
Who can take me to them?

67
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,147
I know someone who might help.

68
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,324
There's a Mandalorian.

69
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,619
Looking for others of his kind.

70
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,746
He was askin' about passage...

71
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,456
He's wearing beskar.

72
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,882
Don't play with your food.

73
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,433
Hmm.

74
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,520
You seek others of your kind?

75
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,439
-Have you seen them?
-Aye.

76
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:46,026
I can bring you to them.

77
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,446
-Where?
-Only a few hours' sail.

78
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:51,823
It'll cost you, though.

79
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,140
Coming around.

80
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,101
Try the other side.

81
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,353
Oh, give me! Yeah, thank you.

82
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,730
Over the side!

83
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,732
You ever see a mamacore eat?

84
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,484
Quite a sight.

85
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,989
Child might take an interest.

86
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,327
You should take a look.

87
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,247
Come on over here.

88
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,667
Get a good view. Let the kid see.

89
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,045
-All right, close enough.

90
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,839
There we go.

91
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,437
She must be hungry.

92
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:06,899
Oftentimes we'll feed her
in the early morning,

93
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:09,526
but we missed that
'cause we were goin' out of port!

94
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,694
No!

95
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,744
Lock it up! Go, go! Now! Go!

96
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,164
The beskar is ours!

97
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,877
-Drown him!

98
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,880
-Get him! Get him! There we go!
-Drown him.

99
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,093
-We're rich, brothers!

100
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,014
-He didn't sink! Finish him!

101
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,641
Keep him down!

102
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,178
Take my hand.

103
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,515
There's a creature.

104
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,184
-It has the Child.
-On it!

105
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,439
The Child. Help the Child.

106
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,441
Don't worry, brother. We've got this.

107
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:58,969
Here you go, little one.

108
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:07,978
Thank you.

109
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,316
I've been searching for more of our kind.

110
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,860
Well, lucky we found you first.

111
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,654
I've been quested to deliver this Child.

112
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:18,780
I was hoping that...

113
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,460
Where did you get that armor?

114
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:35,005
This armor has been in my family
for three generations.

115
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,465
You do not cover your face.

116
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,592
You are not Mandalorian.

117
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:42,513
-He's one of them.
-Dank farrik.

118
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,639
One of what?

119
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,227
I am Bo-Katan of Clan Kryze.

120
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,480
I was born on Mandalore
and fought in the Purge.

121
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,690
I am the last of my line.

122
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,487
And you are a Child of the Watch.

123
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,031
The Watch?

124
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,159
Children of the Watch
are a cult of religious zealots

125
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,328
that broke away from Mandalorian society.

126
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,581
Their goal was to re-establish
the ancient way.

127
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,544
There is only one way.

128
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,838
The Way of the Mandalore.

129
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:07,806
Hey!

130
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,392
You...

131
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,607
You killed my brother.

132
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:26,992
Let me pass.

133
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:32,789
I don't you think you understand.

134
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,628
You killed my brother

135
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:41,965
and now I'm gonna kill your pet.

136
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,390
He didn't kill your brother.

137
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,560
I did.

138
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,029
Can we at least buy you a drink?

139
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,699
Trask is a black market port.

140
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,827
They're staging weapons
that have been bought and sold

141
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,996
with the plunders of our planet.

142
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:16,959
We're seizing those weapons
and using them to retake our home world.

143
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,419
Once we've done that,

144
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,922
we'll seat a new Mandalore on the throne.

145
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,757
That planet is cursed.

146
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,217
Anyone who goes there dies.

147
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:28,136
Once the Empire knew
they couldn't control it,

148
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,138
they made sure no one else could either.

149
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,516
Don't believe everything you hear.

150
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,726
Our enemies wanna separate us.

151
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,063
But Mandalorians are stronger together.

152
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,274
That's not part of my plan.

153
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,443
I've been quested
with returning this Child to the Jedi.

154
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,906
-What do you know of the Jedi?
Nothing.

155
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,993
I was hoping you would help me by Creed.

156
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,799
I can lead you to one of their kind.

157
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:11,054
But first,
we need your help on our mission.

158
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:12,890
Mission?

159
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,811
You see that Imperial Gozanti freighter?

160
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:20,981
It's being loaded with weapons
as we speak.

161
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:25,360
According to the port's manifest,
it's scheduled to depart at first light.

162
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,613
So we stow away?

163
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,240
We've been hitting 'em pretty hard.

164
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:33,702
They scan for life forms as a precaution
before pushing back.

165
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,787
If you wanna do this with four,

166
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:37,873
you're gonna need the element of surprise.

167
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:39,750
Exactly.

168
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:43,253
The freighter will maintain trawling speed

169
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:46,340
while inside the shipping lanes
and then ascend in orbit.

170
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,218
We'll jet up when they're cruising
in atmosphere.

171
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:53,805
The tower won't allow them to climb
until they've left the port's airspace.

172
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,390
Troopers?

173
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,059
A squad at most.

174
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,229
And they couldn't hit
the side of a bantha.

175
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:12,991
Something's come up.

176
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:15,702
-Can I leave him with you for a bit?

177
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,539
You are gonna stay here,

178
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:21,166
so I want you to be respectful.

179
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,334
And mind your manners.

180
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,045
You know what I'm talking about.

181
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:28,841
Thanks.

182
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:33,971
I'll be back for him.

183
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,604
Pirates.

184
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,448
Pirates again.

185
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:41,872
Guard that hall.

186
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:43,916
-Seal the hatch.
-Yes, sir.

187
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,056
A breach in security.

188
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,349
Check the exterior door.

189
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,977
What's going on?
How many of them are there?

190
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,229
At least ten, maybe more.

191
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:50,065
Sir, there are only four life forms.

192
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:53,610
Wait. They're Mandalorian!
We've...

193
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,080
They're headed to the cargo bay.

194
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,794
How long until we clear the atmosphere
and can make the jump to hyperspace?

195
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:13,213
We can't climb until we leave
the harbor zone, sir.

196
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:14,756
Climb now.

197
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:17,342
Climb now!

198
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,483
Look. Over there. Stop them!

199
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:51,710
Go, go, go!

200
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,134
What's happening?

201
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:01,261
The intruders are heading your way.

202
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:04,515
Just hold them off
until we can make the jump to hyperspace

203
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,266
and rendezvous with the fleet.

204
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,434
Copy.

205
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,979
We need to hold them off until
we can make the jump to hyperspace.

206
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,875
-Close the doors.
Sir?

207
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,001
Close the doors!

208
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:36,839
-Which one?
-All of them! All of them!

209
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:43,178
Close all of them! Close all the doors!

210
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:55,899
We have them trapped, sir.

211
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,693
Trapped them where?

212
00:21:58,402 --> 00:21:59,778
In the cargo control area.

213
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,993
-Where?
-In the cargo control area!

214
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:19,506
Come in.

215
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,383
Do you copy?

216
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:24,887
Do you copy?

217
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:28,265
I copy.

218
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:31,143
Thanks for packing up all this gear
so nicely.

219
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:33,770
Imagine what a division of us can do

220
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:36,732
when we get our hands on
what's inside these shiny little boxes.

221
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,567
If you think
you're going to escape

222
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,111
with those weapons,
you are sadly mistaken.

223
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:44,489
Even if you've managed to jettison
a few of those crates,

224
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:49,119
we will comb the entire area
until you are hunted down and killed.

225
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:52,748
Oh, we're not jettisoning anything.

226
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:54,791
We're taking the entire ship.

227
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,543
What?

228
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:01,131
Put some tea on. We'll be up in a minute.

229
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,512
This is more than I signed up for.

230
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:10,724
There is something I need,
if I am to rule Mandalore.

231
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,351
Something that was once mine.

232
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,938
They know where it is and soon, so will I.

233
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:20,025
Regardless, we are taking the ship
for the battles ahead.

234
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,276
I got you your weapons.

235
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:24,655
I have to return to my ship
with the foundling.

236
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,992
If you want my help finding the Jedi,

237
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,995
you will help me take this ship.

238
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:34,873
You're changing the terms of the deal.

239
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:38,335
This is the Way.

240
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:58,564
What is it, Captain?

241
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:01,900
-Another pirate hijacking.
-Were you able to eliminate them?

242
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:04,736
No. We need backup immediately.

243
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:08,782
Are these the same "pirates"
that have attacked our other vessels?

244
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:11,285
They appear to be, sir.

245
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,495
How far have they gotten?

246
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:16,498
They've breached the cargo hold
and taken everything but the bridge.

247
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:19,084
We require immediate backup.

248
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:21,211
If they've taken that much of the ship,

249
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:23,839
I'm afraid that's no longer an option.

250
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:26,550
You know what to do.

251
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:33,724
Long live the Empire.

252
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,269
Long live the Empire.

253
00:24:57,748 --> 00:25:00,209
They're taking the ship down.
Let's move!

254
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:04,671
-There's the bridge. Come on!
Blast 'em!

255
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:10,552
How many troopers?

256
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:14,014
Six to ten.
Two with heavy repeating blasters.

257
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,599
We're losing altitude fast.

258
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:18,560
-We need to move now.
They have too much firepower!

259
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:21,230
Still dropping. Ten thousand.

260
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:25,442
We won't make it to the bridge!

261
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:26,527
Nine thousand.

262
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:31,448
Eight thousand.

263
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,203
Seven thousand.

264
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:37,704
Cover me.

265
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:00,394
Come on!

266
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,454
Where is it?
Where's what?

267
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,667
The Dark saber. Does he have it?

268
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,378
If you're asking, you already know.

269
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,214
Easy. Easy.

270
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:43,937
I'll let you live.

271
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,023
But you will take me to him.

272
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:47,482
You might let me live,

273
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:49,484
but he won't.

274
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:53,197
No!

275
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:54,865
We have to go.

276
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:56,742
He sent a distress signal.

277
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:59,119
Clear the atmosphere and prepare to jump.

278
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,080
Are you sure you won't join us?

279
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,125
There's something I need to do.

280
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:07,503
The offer stands
if you change your mind.

281
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,088
Where can I find the Jedi?

282
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:19,932
Take the foundling to the city of Calodan
on the forest planet of Corvus.

283
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:21,892
There you will find Ahsoka Tano.

284
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:24,186
Tell her you were sent by Bo-Katan.

285
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:26,230
And thank you.

286
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:29,024
Your bravery will not be forgotten.

287
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:32,236
This is the Way.

288
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:34,655
This is the Way.

289
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:04,768
Thank you for watching him.

290
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,019
Okay, kid.

291
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:07,896
Come on. It's time to go.

292
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:10,232
-Let go. Come on, kid.

293
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:12,776
Congratulations.

294
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:17,781
No, I have enough pets.

295
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:36,091
I gave you a thousand credits,

296
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:37,843
this was the best you could do?

297
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:08,624
Mon Calamari.

298
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,252
Unbelievable.

299
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:05,806
I finally know where I'm taking you.

300
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:07,975
But it's gonna be a bumpy ride.
