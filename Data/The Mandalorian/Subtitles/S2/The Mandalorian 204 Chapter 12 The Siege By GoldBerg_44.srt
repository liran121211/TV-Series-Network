160

But then he disappeared one day
after a bit of "creative accounting."

161
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,920

to let me work off my debt.

But over on this side is the problem.

177
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,500
It's an old Imperial base.

178
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,750
It's where all those troops came from
when we defeated Moff Gideon.

179
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,050
This base has been here
since the Imperial expansion.

180
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,840
It's got a skeleton crew, but for
some reason, it hasn't been abandoned.

181
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,970
There's a lot o'
heavy weaponry in that place

182
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,010
the black market would love
to dismantle and get their hands on.

183
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,310
And you wanna mop up the last
of the Imperial force before they do.

184
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,480
Mando, I just want them off my planet.

185
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,820
If we could take out that one last base,
Nevarro would be completely safe.

186
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,030
We could be a trade anchor
for the entire sector.

187
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,150
And the planet would finally be free.

188
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,080
What are we looking at?

189
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,130
The whole base is powered by a reactor.

190
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,090
We sneak in, overload the reactor,
and get the hell outta there.
