They are surrounded by televisions playing mindless entertainment all day long, including TV shows that mock the odd overweight citizen who cannot workout, a lot of pornography...and a talent show similar to the real-world Got Talent franchise. When Bing meets, Abi, a woman with a talent for singing, he believes she can win the competition and earn a better life. However, after he makes sacrifice upon sacrifice to get her to the show, she is degraded and harassed by the judges and audience, who offer her a choice: start a career in pornography...or go back to being a slave. Her choice inspires a revelation in Bing, who begins to see the cruel injustice of the world in which he lives, and he is determined to change it...no matter what the cost.\u2014alexandriahicks-10795"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2089049", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 68584, "number_of_episodes": 33}
