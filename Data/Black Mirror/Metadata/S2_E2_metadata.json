She walks around the house with amnesia and glimpses of a girl. She sees a picture of her, a man and the girl on a fireplace and she concludes she might be her daughter. She leaves the house and sees people watching and filming her passively. Out of the blue, a man with a rifle hunts her down and she runs under the view of the inhabitants. She meets a young woman called Jem that explains to her that most of the population is controlled by a signal from the White Bear transmitted that transforms them into voyeurs. They run to a convenience store in a gas station and the hunter shoots and kills Jem's friend Damien. They run to escape and a man called Baxter stops a van and saves them from hunters. But the guy is a sadistic hunter but they succeed to flee. Jem explains that she intends to burn the White Bear to the ground and they drive to the facility. When they reach the place, Victoria learns secrets about her and the place where nothing is what seems to be.\u2014Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2542420", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 59043, "number_of_episodes": 33}
