00:00:26,763 --> 00:00:34,303
_

3
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:12,354
- Hey, Lacie!
- Hey!

4
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:09,874
Ryan?

5
00:02:11,538 --> 00:02:12,818
Ryan!

6
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,834
- I was holding a bomb!
- Come on!

7
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:24,434
Sorry, guys.

8
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:30,194
Landlord is sending buyers over
today so... put your pants on.

9
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:34,554
Maybe if I don't, it'll scare 'em
off and we can stay here.

10
00:02:34,578 --> 00:02:37,994
Not an option, Ryan.
Lease is up in four weeks.

11
00:02:38,018 --> 00:02:40,058
Hey, I'm thinking of you.
I've got somewhere to go.

12
00:02:40,818 --> 00:02:44,538
Nate's roommate took a job in
Phoenix so I get his place.

13
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:47,874
- Okay.
- Now who's the slow poke?

14
00:02:47,898 --> 00:02:53,338
I'm... seeing some places
over lunch. Catch you later.

15
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,578
Sorry, that was my sister.

16
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:04,338
Yeah. Yeah, I bet you'd love to.

17
00:03:10,698 --> 00:03:11,978
Jasmine tea?

18
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:25,458
And that's one Brushed Suede.

19
00:03:26,418 --> 00:03:28,154
You want a cookie with that?

20
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:31,778
- It's on the house.
- Sounds awesome.

21
00:03:37,138 --> 00:03:39,954
- See you tomorrow, JJ.
- See you, Lacie.

22
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:45,520
Oh, I saw your boy in
the fire hat just now! So cute!

23
00:03:45,544 --> 00:03:47,850
Yeah, he's really something.

24
00:04:34,738 --> 00:04:35,618
Hmm.

25
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:14,314
Hey, Lacie!

26
00:05:14,338 --> 00:05:17,754
- Bets, it's great to see you!
- You too.

27
00:05:29,218 --> 00:05:30,594
How's Pancakes?

28
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:34,874
He's hilarious. Such a
funny cat. Just the best.

29
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,074
- Are you still at Hoddicker?
- Mm-hmm.

30
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:44,194
- Yeah. It's going pretty great.
- Good to hear.

31
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,434
- So what brings you back here?
- New job, first day.

32
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,954
- First day?
- At Blankman-Harper.

33
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:51,874
Whoa! Top floor! That's...

34
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:55,258
- Well, good luck.
- I know, right?

35
00:05:56,618 --> 00:05:59,714
It's great you're still
happy at Hoddicker.

36
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:02,034
- Well, maybe not forever.
- No, not forever.

37
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:03,754
- But for now...
- It's OK for now.

38
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:07,338
It's great for now, yes. Yes, it is.

39
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:07,354
Lacie, I got you a smoothie.

40
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:11,138
Got one for everyone, actually.
Still a bunch of them for grabs.

41
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:15,074
They're from the organic
stall at the farmers' market.

42
00:07:15,098 --> 00:07:16,578
Sure. Okay.

43
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,898
Mmm!

44
00:07:31,338 --> 00:07:33,338
Thank you. Thank you.

45
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:40,058
We're kind
of not talking to Ches.

46
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:45,234
- 3.1? What happened?
- Him and Gordon split up.

47
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:46,754
Oh...

48
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:49,714
- Poor Ches.
- No, no, no, we're all on Gordon's side.

49
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:52,474
Sure! Obviously.

50
00:07:52,498 --> 00:07:56,074
Ches is kissing ass.
Trying to scrape himself back.

51
00:07:56,098 --> 00:08:00,554
Of course, if it drops below two-five,
then it's... bye-bye.

52
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:10,993
_

53
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:32,874
Hello?

54
00:08:32,898 --> 00:08:35,874
- Yo, they're taking it.
- Who?

55
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:39,194
The couple the landlord sent over.
I heard them talking.

56
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,258
Okay.

57
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:47,354
So, now we move into
the light space area.

58
00:08:47,378 --> 00:08:51,314
Ideal for special times with loved ones.

59
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:55,298
- Great food, great company.
- Mm-hmm!

60
00:08:57,698 --> 00:09:00,514
Whoa!

61
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:03,018
Sampled your
photo stream to make her.

62
00:09:04,098 --> 00:09:05,634
Great hair!

63
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:08,080
Styled free of charge
at the members' salon.

64
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,658
Oh, my God.

65
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,954
It's hilarious!

66
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:17,674
You like him?

67
00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:20,794
- He's okay.
- He doesn't come with the apartment.

68
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:28,114
But there is a bar and restaurant
on site, tenants only.

69
00:09:28,138 --> 00:09:32,314
We have unparalleled
metrics on romantic geneses.

70
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,434
Uh-huh.

71
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:37,180
I gotta say,
these places are going like "that."

72
00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:41,419
- So don't delay if you're interested.
- Oh, I'm more than interested.

73
00:09:41,443 --> 00:09:45,299
Standard occupancy on a
minimum six-month contract,

74
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:48,763
we're talking... this much.

75
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,043
- How often are the payments?
- That's weekly.

76
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:55,459
Okay.

77
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:57,459
- A little more than expected?
- Yeah.

78
00:09:57,484 --> 00:09:59,179
There's options.

79
00:09:59,203 --> 00:10:01,659
You know our Prime Influencers Programme?

80
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:04,403
- Do I qualify for that?
- No. No, you don't.

81
00:10:05,243 --> 00:10:07,603
We'd need you around a 4.5.

82
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:11,659
4.5?

83
00:10:11,683 --> 00:10:14,843
Hit 4.5 and there's a 20% discount.

84
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:20,763
- 4.5.
- That's right.

85
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:20,699
Pelican Cove? What is this?
A eugenics programme?

86
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:25,699
- A lifestyle community.
- No one is this happy.

87
00:11:25,723 --> 00:11:28,219
A two-year-old with a fucking
balloon isn't this happy.

88
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:31,180
It's actually a pretty cool place.

89
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:35,043
Like you'd even qualify.

90
00:11:41,603 --> 00:11:43,259
There's nothing I can do, sir.

91
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:45,779
Well, it's not hopeless,
you're clearly a tryer.

92
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:49,339
That's the sense you get just from... me?

93
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:52,019
From your rep report analytics.

94
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:55,659
If we drill down into the numbers,
you've got a solid popularity arc here.

95
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:59,163
Strong overall trajectory.
Let's just look at the last 24 hours.

96
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:00,893
You see, even...

97
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:05,459
What's that? 8:40 a.m. You're
working hard on your socials.

98
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:07,499
- Great little uptake there.
- Okay.

99
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:10,859
Couple of minor dings there.
You cut someone off in traffic?

100
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:13,779
Oh, just a workplace thing.

101
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:16,819
Okay. Let's check on
your sphere of influence.

102
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:18,883
Let me zoom out here.

103
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:23,219
Great peripherals.
Strangers like you, that's a plus.

104
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:27,539
- Healthy inner circle. It's good.
- Thank you.

105
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:31,443
There's a ways to go,
but 4.5 is certainly achievable.

106
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,356
How long do you think?

107
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,556
- To hit 4.5?
- Mm-hmm.

108
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,636
Well, barring a major setback,

109
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,820
a public disgrace kind of deal,
I'd say 18 months or so.

110
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,356
Oh, I need more short term.
Like... much more.

111
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,660
Then you'll need a boost.

112
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,740
- What kind of a boost?
- Well...

113
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,036
Most of your interactions are
confined to your inner circle

114
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,556
and they're largely, pardon the term,
mid-to low-range folks.

115
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,996
Same with your outer circle.

116
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,276
You've got a ton of reciprocal five
stars from service industry workers,

117
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,236
but there's not much else.

118
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,579
At least as far as I can see.

119
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:10,876
So in terms of quality,
you could use a punch up right there.

120
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,060
Ideally, that's up votes
from quality people.

121
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,596
- Quality people?
- High fours.

122
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,236
Impress those up-scale folks,
you'll gain velocity on your arc

123
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,900
and there's your boost.

124
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,460
- Oh, hi, JJ!
- Hey, Lacie!

125
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,620
- Keith! Hello.
- Lacie!

126
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
- You look great today.
- Thank you!

127
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,017
- Door won't open. I'm on 2.4.
- Sorry, Ches. I'm late.

128
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:52,962
I just need some stars, please!

129
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,940
Fuck!

130
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,196
- Oh, hi!
- Hi!

131
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,556
- How's it going at Blankman?
- Just great.

132
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:15,780
- Well, I bet you work... good there.
- Thank you.

133
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,156
Would you like a croissant?

134
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,356
They gave me an extra
at the coffee place.

135
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,556
- Oh, no, I already ate.
- Okay, sure. All good. Yes.

136
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,820
Yeah.

137
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,516
Well, here's me, so...

138
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,036
Don't try too hard.
It's impossible to respect.

139
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,556
High fours can smell it
a mile off. Just be you.

140
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,876
Authentic gestures, that's the key.

141
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,340
- That's time up, I'll catch you later.
- Oh, could I just ask...

142
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,820
... "Mr. Rags."

143
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:06,104
_

144
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:08,555
_

145
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,185
Shit!

146
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,756
- What the fuck is that?
- Tapenade. Want some?

147
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,516
Who even are you?

148
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,076
It's just something I wanna eat, Ryan.

149
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,900
Oh, my God.

150
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,060
- What is it?
- Naomi!

151
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,860
Shit!

152
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:18,140
Old school, el perfecto Naomi?
You guys keep in contact?

153
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,260
Ryan, just go! Go!

154
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,116
- Oh, my God!
- Nay-Nay, how are you?

155
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,516
I was just fixing myself a snack.

156
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:38,436
Oh, Lace, could I just say I
am so happy to see your face?

157
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,276
- Me too. It's been...
- Too long.

158
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,267
- Way too long.
- And that's my fault.

159
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:46,156
- No, it's mine. Everything is just so...
- Everything's just so...

160
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,516
Crazy! Oh, it's so good to see you.

161
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,076
When you posted that
Mr. Rags photo...

162
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,076
I know, Mr. Rags!

163
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,076
I just had to call

164
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,396
and talk to you because...

165
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,396
Whoo-hoo!

166
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,875
Wow! That's a... big ring!

167
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,636
Congratulations! Who's the, um... Paul?

168
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,236
He is great. So smart. Just sweet.

169
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,076
I know you're gonna love him.

170
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,236
Uh-huh.

171
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,996
So, anyways, the big day...

172
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,236
Yes, when is it?

173
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,756
So, we're getting married in a month

174
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,916
on his family's estate

175
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,196
up here on the island.

176
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,996
This place outside Port Mary,
Honeysuckle. You heard of it?

177
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,076
No, but...

178
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,996
Well, it's a private island.

179
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,316
Take a looooook!

180
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,596
Oh, wow! That is...

181
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:42,076
I know, right? So... can you make it?

182
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,540
Are you kidding? Of course.

183
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,500
Great, cool,
cos I was wondering if...

184
00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:51,020
Lace, do you think...

185
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,540
Would you be my maid of honour?

186
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,527
Seriously?

187
00:18:57,196 --> 00:18:58,276
Oh, my God.

188
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:05,116
I mean, you've got such cool
friends now. Are you sure?

189
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:09,876
Remember when we used to plan our
dream weddings when we were, like, 11?

190
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,515
- I know but we haven't s...
- I don't know, just seeing Mr. Rags...

191
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,236
All the memories.
It just brought things home.

192
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,396
Oh, Nay-Nay.

193
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,755
I know we haven't kept in touch
as much as I'd have liked

194
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,916
and that is totally my fault,
but this is a big day.

195
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,636
A big life day and I want my oldest
friend with me, my oldest friend.

196
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,420
I want you by my side.

197
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,020
Oh, my God. Thank you.

198
00:19:38,156 --> 00:19:39,996
What do I have to...

199
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,356
Not much to it. A speech, mainly.

200
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,476
Speech? Of course!

201
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,236
Mm-hmm. How big's the crowd?

202
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,756
Oh, my gosh, like... hundreds!

203
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,356
It's a crazy guest list. I'll send it now.

204
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,356
Paul's invited so many,
I don't want to call them big deals,

205
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,766
but they're all, like, 4.7 or above.

206
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,780
Uh-huh.

207
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,116
Nay-Nay, I will not
let you down.

208
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,276
Don't sweat too much!
Just talk about old memories.

209
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,876
- Sure.
- How we were, any old things.

210
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,956
- Gotcha.
- I'll ping you some anecdotes.

211
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,196
- That would be great.
- And what's your dress size?

212
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,436
Oh, um...

213
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,596
I'll tell you what,
I'll just send you a four.

214
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,956
- Perfect.
- We got matching bridesmaids dresses.

215
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,836
Well, anyway...

216
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,171
Love you, Lay.

217
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:34,916
You too, Nay-Nay!

218
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,740
Oh!

219
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,556
Bye.

220
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,460
What was that? The F-word?

221
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,740
You two pussy pals now?

222
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,756
Shut up.

223
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,116
- She was always mean to you.
- No, she wasn't.

224
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,876
- She had that rhyme about you.
- That was a game.

225
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,316
- What about when she cut your hair?
- I asked her to.

226
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,956
She fucked Greg.

227
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,940
She... did not fuck Greg.

228
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,820
She looked hot. I'll give her that.

229
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:24,047
Okay.

230
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,540
Impressive.

231
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,996
- Uh-huh. Jesus. Yeah, that'd do it.
- Mm-hmm.

232
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,796
Pelican Cove.

233
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,996
Carole, it's Lacie. Saw the
place yesterday. I wanna take it.

234
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,836
That's fantastic!

235
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,796
Uh... Oh, I see you're still
on a 4.2. Is that, um...

236
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,716
Yep, I'm on it, just gonna
transfer the deposit now.

237
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,422
- Well, okay.
- Yes!

238
00:21:54,597 --> 00:21:59,420
In this world, we're all so
caught up in our own heads.

239
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:06,500
It's easy to lose sight of
what's real. What matters.

240
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,020
But as I stand here today...

241
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:17,380
seeing the joy Paul has
brought to Naomi's life,

242
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,100
I know she's someone
who truly matters to me.

243
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,300
Nay-Nay,

244
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:33,596
the little girl who, when we were
just five-years-old in art camp,

245
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,820
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared.

246
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:46,780
The girl who helped me make
Mr. Rags. I still have him.

247
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,020
He sits on my desk and...

248
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,740
every day, he reminds me of Nay-Nay.

249
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,500
What she meant to me then and now.

250
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,700
I am so honored to be here

251
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,860
and I wish you all the happiness
this stupid world can muster.

252
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,780
I love you, Nay-Nay.

253
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,060
Is the tear too much?

254
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,036
You fucking sociopath.

255
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:30,116
- Ryan, my car's here. Was it too much?
- What, the tear, the photo, Mr. Rags?

256
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,076
I do keep him on my desk.

257
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,996
There's sugary and then
there's fucking diabetes.

258
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,876
I just wanna make her
happy on her wedding day.

259
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,876
The captive audience of 4-point
holies five-starring your ass off,

260
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,036
that's just a bonus.

261
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,396
- Naomi and I were best friends.
- Come on...

262
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,356
I wish her well and wanna
express it the best I can.

263
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,876
And, yeah, if I nail a speech
and get five-starred

264
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,356
by hundreds of primes, so what?
It's a win-win.

265
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,641
What are you hoping for? Like, 4.3, 4.4?

266
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,722
Unh-unh. You get points
from your gaming buddies.

267
00:24:00,746 --> 00:24:03,402
It's the same thing.
Don't shit on me for aiming higher.

268
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:04,722
Pelican Cove higher?

269
00:24:04,746 --> 00:24:07,642
What's wrong with Pelican Cove?
They're great apartments!

270
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,642
They are fake-smile jail cells.

271
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,706
Great. Car cancelled.

272
00:24:12,844 --> 00:24:16,185
And he marked me down so now I have
to book another, and I took a ding.

273
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,956
- Great job.
- I am sorry, but I miss the normal you.

274
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,076
Before this obsession, when we
had conversations, remember?

275
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,156
I need my charger.

276
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:29,676
This whole ranking thing, just
comparing yourself to people who...

277
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,916
- Have you seen my charger?
- ...only pretend to be happy.

278
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,700
I said don't borrow this!

279
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,956
High fours like Naomi,
I bet they're suicidal on the inside.

280
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,676
My car is here. Again.

281
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,876
Your Pelican Cove deposit,
is it refundable?

282
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,356
Like, what if this doesn't work?

283
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,396
- Can't you just stay out of my shit?
- You're my sister!

284
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,236
Yes! And if you cared about that,
maybe you would've noticed

285
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,180
living with you hasn't been one
big rainbow sandwich for me.

286
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,916
Do you know why I never
brought any guys back here?

287
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,476
Because I didn't want them to know
I was sharing a skanky-ass cave

288
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,540
with Mr. Three Point Fuck.

289
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,980
Good luck with your performance!

290
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,020
Oh, hi, hi! I'm coming. I'm coming.

291
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,556
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

292
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,620
That's great. Just great.

293
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,700
Oh... Hi.

294
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,916
Nay-Nay!

295
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,036
Hey, Lace! Just checking in.

296
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,236
I'm on my way to the
airport right now.

297
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,596
Okay, cool, and you're all
good for the rehearsal dinner?

298
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,476
Oh, yeah. The flight's, what, an hour?
That restaurant looks so cool.

299
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,396
- Uh-huh. And you got the dress okay?
- Mm-hmm. In my case.

300
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,756
- I love the pink.
- Uh-huh.

301
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,836
So the latest draft of
the speech is great.

302
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,876
Going handwritten's so cool.

303
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,516
Those scans of the page, my God,
I welled up just at that.

304
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,060
- Oh, thank you!
- Um... just one thought.

305
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,196
That whole bit where I help you
with the eating disorder thing...

306
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,436
- You think that's a little...
- A little over-sharing, yeah.

307
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,476
You're so right. It's gone.

308
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,436
Okay. Cool. Well, I'll
see you in a few hours!

309
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,396
♪ I'm getting married tomorrow ♪

310
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,265
And here's your tip. Thank you.

311
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,180
Oh, come on.

312
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,660
May I
have your attention, please...

313
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:31,582
- Hi there, how are you doing?
- I am wonderful.

314
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,420
I am so sorry, that flight is cancelled.

315
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,860
- No. No, no, no.
- Customer incident at the other end.

316
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,316
But... So when is the next flight?

317
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,396
Yeah, they're all kind of full.

318
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,076
Uh... I booked this weeks ago.
It's my best friend's wedding.

319
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,236
- I'm sorry.
- I have to get there. I have to.

320
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,156
Okay... let's see what we can do.

321
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,220
Thank you. Thank you so much.

322
00:28:05,102 --> 00:28:07,876
I see there's one standby seat
on another plane leaving tonight.

323
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,500
Uh...

324
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,156
That's reserved for members
of our Prime Flight Programme.

325
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,156
You gotta be a 4.2 or over to qualify.

326
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,516
- Oh, I'm... I'm a 4.2.
- Uh-huh.

327
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,871
I'm afraid you're actually a 4.183.

328
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,956
Oh. Well, that's not my fault. Um...

329
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,596
Some woman dinged me
down in the... Can't you just...

330
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,116
I'm sorry, it won't let me book
it without the correct ranking.

331
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,236
- But it's so close.
- There's just nothing I can do.

332
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,996
- Christ, I mean, surely.
- I'm gonna have to ask you

333
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,076
to moderate your language there.

334
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,420
Sorry. It's just...

335
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,436
I'm maid of honour.
I cannot miss this wedding.

336
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,380
And I am so sorry about that.

337
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,276
- Can you call the supervisor?
- I cannot do that.

338
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,916
- Can you just call the supervisor?
- I cannot do that.

339
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,836
- Call the fucking supervisor!
- Okay, that's profanity.

340
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,516
- We're zero tolerance on profanity.
- I'm sorry. It's just...

341
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,836
- I have to serve the next customer.
- No, no, no, no.

342
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,036
- Can you step away, ma'am?
- God, just fucking help me!

343
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,116
Ooh.

344
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,460
I'm so sorry.

345
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,596
- I've called security.
- Oh, no, no, no. Please don't do that.

346
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:17,936
I'm, uh... five-starring you. Five stars.

347
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,156
- What's the issue here, Hannah?
- Intimidation and profanity.

348
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,556
- Oh, no, no. I was not intimidating.
- Don't speak, ma'am.

349
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,300
- I was just trying to...
- Ma'am.

350
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,956
Okay. So, in order to restore calm,

351
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,276
I'm invoking my authority
as airport security

352
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,276
to dock you one full ranking
point as a punitive measure.

353
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,196
- This is a temporary measure.
- No!

354
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,948
Your score reverts
to normal in 24 hours.

355
00:29:37,973 --> 00:29:38,916
No, no, no. But I need it now.

356
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,436
During this period, all down votes
are subject to a times two multiplier.

357
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,556
Times two?

358
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,636
We recommend you avoid
negative feedback at this time.

359
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,716
I'm on double damage?

360
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,914
Please, remove yourself
from the airport immediately.

361
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,156
Okay, well, due to your ranking...

362
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,036
Hi there. Chuck! Great name.

363
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,876
- Thank you.
- Hope you're having a great night.

364
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,636
- It's pretty good.
- So I need a car.

365
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,796
- You got a vehicle in mind?
- Anything, really.

366
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,516
Well, due to your current ranking,

367
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,356
you're restricted to
our super saver fleet.

368
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,316
- Yep. That's... Yeah.
- I-Cruiser 2?

369
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,340
They still have the 2?

370
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,516
Oh, God.

371
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,116
Oh, come on.

372
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,916
Uh...

373
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,820
Damn it!

374
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,820
The little girl, who when we were
both five years old in art camp,

375
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,860
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared.

376
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,740
The girl who helped me make Mr. Rags...

377
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:37,436
Teardrop. Crowd goes wild. You can do this.

378
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:47,220
- Sorry, okay, I swear I'm on my way.
- How far away are you?

379
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,796
Uh... Quite a ways. I missed my flight.

380
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,396
- What?
- Well, not missed it but...

381
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,260
So you're not gonna make
the rehearsal dinner?

382
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,676
- No.
- Lacie!

383
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,540
I am so sorry. It's been...

384
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,556
I got a rental car. I'm driving.

385
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,476
Driving? That's like nine hours.

386
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,876
I'm making good time,

387
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,396
gonna go through the night,
make a road trip out of it.

388
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,780
Is everything okay?

389
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,596
I can find a replacement
if something's wrong.

390
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,596
No. No. No. I'll be there.
I swear on Mr. Rags.

391
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,076
Ha ha ha!

392
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,196
Okay, just drive safe!

393
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,876
You bet. I'll just...

394
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,340
Come on.

395
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,916
Come on.

396
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,220
Please.

397
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,940
Okay.

398
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,316
What do you want?

399
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,980
Oh, shit.

400
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,100
Hi. Sorry.

401
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,940
Your charger doesn't fit my car.

402
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,580
- Don't see those around much these days.
- It's a rental.

403
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:20,620
Ours chargers are Q2Z, yours one's a K1.
They didn't give you an adapter?

404
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,380
No. Do you have one?

405
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:30,196
- Not in here. Ask around.
- Thanks, anyway.

406
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,260
You're super helpful.

407
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,060
Two stars?!

408
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,396
Two stars?

409
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,540
Wasn't a meaningful encounter.

410
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,036
Sir, excuse me.

411
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,796
Excuse me, sorry.

412
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,500
Do you have a K1 adapter, by any chance?

413
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:07,220
Ma'am, how about you, a K1 adapter,
perhaps, in the trunk of your car?

414
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,649
Sure.

415
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,220
Great.

416
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,940
Oh, ma'am, hi. Do you have a K1 adapter?

417
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,260
I have a rental car. It's...

418
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:10,060
- Slow down. Let's give her a ride.
- She's, like, 2.8.

419
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,260
Come on!

420
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,100
I didn't even do anything!

421
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,500
You look like you need a ride.

422
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,356
Um...

423
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,180
Actually, I'm okay.

424
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:57,820
Don't look it. Come on. I don't bite.

425
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:05,196
Luther, Mrs. Coffee, reds,
whiskey. Help yourself.

426
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,060
I'm okay. Thanks.

427
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,556
Where are you headed?

428
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:14,380
Uh... Just as close as you can get
to Port Mary would be great.

429
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,900
Checking my feed for danger signs?

430
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:32,980
I get it a lot. 1.4 gotta be
an antisocial maniac, right?

431
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,316
- You seem...
- Normal?

432
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,540
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

433
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,620
It took some effort.
What happened to you?

434
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:49,436
I mean, you're a 2.8,
but you don't look 2.8.

435
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,116
That's not... This is temporary.

436
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,316
- I'm gonna turn it around.
- Uh-huh.

437
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,556
- I'm going to a wedding. Maid of honour.
- Nice.

438
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,140
Wanna hear my speech?

439
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,940
No.

440
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,996
So how come you're a 2.8?

441
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,516
Well, I got marked down
at the airport for yelling,

442
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,196
and they put me on double damage.

443
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,380
- How did it feel?
- Awful.

444
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,700
I meant the yelling.

445
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,620
I don't know. I was mad.

446
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,700
Look at where it got me.

447
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,916
But as long as I get to the
wedding, do the speech,

448
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,396
they'll overlook the
2.8. I'm with the bride.

449
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,476
And if I do well, well,
they're all high fours

450
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,756
so that velocitates my arc.

451
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:39,436
And once they lift the point penalty,
well, my average goes way up,

452
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,020
and, yeah, it's gonna be okay.

453
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,356
God, you remind me of me.

454
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,820
- Hmm.
- Not now.

455
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,380
I was, uh... 4.6 once.

456
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,180
- 4.6?
- Used to live for it.

457
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,780
All the work I put in...

458
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,996
Eight years ago, Tom,
my husband, got cancer.

459
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:15,260
It was pancreatic. It was a real bitch.
The symptoms showed up late.

460
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,820
I'm so sorry.

461
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,316
You don't know me so
you're not really sorry.

462
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:25,580
You're just mainly awkward cos I
have sprung some cancer talk at you.

463
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,196
Anyway, I five-starred every doctor,

464
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:33,836
every nurse, every high-four
consultant that we had.

465
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,676
Ding. Ding. Ding. Thank you so much.

466
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,420
The cancer didn't give a shit.
It just kept growing.

467
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,596
A couple of months in, we heard
about this experimental treatment.

468
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:47,300
It was very expensive.
It was very exclusive.

469
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,300
I did everything I could
to get him a spot there.

470
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,780
Tom was a 4.3.

471
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,260
They gave his bed to a 4.4.

472
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:10,420
So when he died I thought, fuck it.

473
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,876
I started saying what I wanted,
when I wanted.

474
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,380
Just drop it out there.

475
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,940
People don't always like that.

476
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,276
It is incredible how fast
you slip off the ladder

477
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,036
when you start doing that.

478
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,580
It turned out a lot of my
friends didn't care for honesty.

479
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:35,956
Treated me like I had taken a
shit at their breakfast table.

480
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:40,036
But, Jesus Christ, it felt good.

481
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,540
Shedding those fuckers.

482
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,300
It was like taking off tight shoes.

483
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:50,036
- Maybe you should try it?
- Oh, come on.

484
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,396
Why not?

485
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:56,116
I can't just kick off my shoes
and walk the earth or whatever.

486
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,500
- You won't know unless you try.
- Oh, that's just...

487
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,876
Look, you had something with your life,

488
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:10,636
real things, good things,
and you lost it all, and I'm sorry.

489
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:15,276
So now you've got nothing left to lose.

490
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,196
But I don't even have the
something worth losing, not yet.

491
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,660
You know, I mean,
I'm still fighting for that.

492
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,860
- And what is "that"?
- I don't know. Enough to be content?

493
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:35,220
Like, to look around and think,
well, I guess I'm okay.

494
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:40,820
Just to be able to breathe out,
not feeling like... like...

495
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:48,236
Like just... And that is
way off, like, way, way off.

496
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,100
And until I get there, I have
to play the numbers game.

497
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:55,900
We all do, that's what we're in.
That's how the fucking world works.

498
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:01,940
Look, maybe you don't remember,
you know, you're just too old to get it.

499
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,020
I do not mean that how it sounds.

500
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,060
Don't worry. I'm not voting you down.

501
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,236
- Sweetheart.
- What time is it?

502
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:43,556
I'm heading east from here so I think
you need to get yourself another ride.

503
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:46,716
- Where are we?
- About 30 miles from Port Mary.

504
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,036
A lot of buses stop here
so you should be fine.

505
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,356
- Well, thank you.
- Good luck with your speech.

506
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,756
I put a little something in there for you.

507
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:02,336
- You did?
- Emergency escape hatch!

508
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,540
Bye.

509
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,636
In this world,
we're all so caught up...

510
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,876
...in our own dramas.

511
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,116
- So, Dad was like...
- It's easy to forget what matters.

512
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,715
He'd never even heard of the show.

513
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:33,756
I'm like, "You never heard of
Sea of Tranquillity?"

514
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,476
Like, the number-one sci-fi fantasy,

515
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,476
and he's all like,
"What the fuck?" Whatever!

516
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,716
I think I'm allergic to this purple.

517
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:44,036
So I'm like, "Well, I'm going
to Tranquillity Con in Port Mary.

518
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,716
That's why I'm dressed
like Lieutenant Duster."

519
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,636
He's all like, "Uh...
Port Mary is frickin' miles away."

520
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,756
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

521
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:55,636
He one-stars me. Like, thanks, Dad.

522
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:59,060
- See you back on there.
- Okay.

523
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,716
Are you guys headed to Tranquillity Con?

524
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,756
- You're into Sea of Tranquillity?
- Totally.

525
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,356
I was all set to go.

526
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:17,100
My friend, who is there already,
has my costume, but my car broke down.

527
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,460
Well, there's some space in the RV.

528
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,476
- Hi.
- Hey!

529
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,636
- You're a Trank head, huh?
- Sorry?

530
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,956
Trank head. Sea of Tranquillity fan?

531
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,596
Oh, yeah. We say Tranksters where I'm from.

532
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:43,236
- Who's your favourite character?
- Gotta be Lieutenant Duster.

533
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,076
- She's awesome.
- She?

534
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,356
He! I misspoke.

535
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:50,116
Lieutenant Duster has no fixed gender.

536
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,716
I know, and that's why it's
so hard to remember, right?

537
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,756
Excuse me. Gotta get this.

538
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,460
My friend, at the convention.

539
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,596
Hi, Nay!

540
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:07,956
So, oh, my God, insane night,
but I am so close now.

541
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,556
Don't come.

542
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,156
What? No. No. I'm, like, an hour away.

543
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,196
Don't come. I don't want you here.

544
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:18,796
I don't know what is up with you,
but I cannot have a 2.6 at my wedding.

545
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:22,156
Oh, no, that's temporary!
That's temporary.

546
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,476
Well, the wedding's today so...

547
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,036
- But it doesn't change anything.
- Lacie...

548
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,236
- I can still do the same speech.
- Lacie...

549
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,556
- And there's Mr. Rags!
- No!

550
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,236
But... But you invited me.

551
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,916
You've seen the guest list.
They are all, like, 4.5 or above.

552
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:41,356
They are going to freak at a 2.6,
and I am not taking that kind of damage,

553
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,020
plus I haven't dipped under
a 4.7 in, like, six months.

554
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,076
You said you wanted your oldest friend.

555
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,236
When I asked you to speak,
you were a 4.2, okay?

556
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,636
And the authenticity of a vintage bond
low four at a gathering of this calibre

557
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,676
played fantastically on all
the stimulations we ran.

558
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,956
Forecast was a prestige
bounce of 2 minimum.

559
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:04,556
But now you're a sub three. Sorry.

560
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,276
That just puts the stink on
things a little too much.

561
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,476
That just plays badly for us.

562
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,956
So it was just about numbers for you?

563
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,116
Oh, cut the shit! It was
numbers for both of us.

564
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,076
You wanted those
primo votes, don't deny it.

565
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,156
It's not like you could get them on
your own. Let's not kid ourselves.

566
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,596
Oh, I'm... I'm getting those votes.

567
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,956
What? You're just gonna roll up
here and make people like you?

568
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:29,636
- That's right. I'm doing my speech.
- No, you're not.

569
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:34,076
Yes, I am. And they are gonna vote me
through the roof when they hear it.

570
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:39,156
- Weep their fucking eyes out!
- Go home!

571
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,196
Hello?

572
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,780
Fuck!

573
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,620
I have never seen
your stupid fucking show.

574
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:59,020
Hope they cancel it!

575
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,620
I need a ride!

576
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,860
Fuck!

577
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,980
Jesus!

578
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,060
Hey! Hey!

579
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:42,700
Hey!

580
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,116
- Can I borrow your bike?
- What?

581
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:50,316
Can I borrow your bike?

582
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:55,316
Do you, Naomi Jayne Blestow,
take this man to be your husband,

583
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,260
to live together with him
in the covenant of marriage?

584
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,276
To love him, comfort him,

585
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,956
honour and keep him,
in sickness and in health...

586
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,380
and forsaking all others,
be faithful unto him...

587
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,276
To my best mate, Anthony.
Let's hear it for him.

588
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:21,356
You've been there from day one.
I love you, man. I appreciate you.

589
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:24,916
Hilarious speech, by the way.
By your standards.

590
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,156
- Pow! Pow! Pow!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

591
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,836
He's still got a few
bullets left. Oh, man.

592
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,900
Oh, gosh, well, um...

593
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,060
Shit!

594
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,596
We have so many people to
thank. Our beautiful bridesmaids.

595
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,476
But, of course,

596
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:50,556
my most heartfelt thanks,
my warmest thanks,

597
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,860
are to someone who's my best friend,

598
00:50:55,140 --> 00:51:02,036
my lover and now,
I'm honoured to say, my wife.

599
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,580
Naomi!

600
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:11,900
One, two, three! Naomi!

601
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,236
The A Team!

602
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,676
I love you so much, darl.

603
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,276
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!

604
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,316
Congratulations, sir.

605
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,196
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

606
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,356
Get over here!

607
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,956
Get your ass over here.

608
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,636
Get in here, big boy.

609
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,700
You're beautiful!

610
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:36,636
Yeah! Gimme five! Good choice!

611
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,060
You fucking earned it, man.
You fucking earned it.

612
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,276
Everybody, hello!

613
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,340
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.

614
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:55,140
Can everyone be quiet for a moment?

615
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:58,860
Thank you.

616
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,396
- Get rid of her.
- That would play awful.

617
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,716
She's a fucking 1.1.

618
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:09,156
Now for those of you who don't
know me, which is... all of you...

619
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:13,196
my name is Lacie Pound

620
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:17,060
and, believe it or not,
I am one of Naomi's oldest friends.

621
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,780
Hi, Nay-Nay!

622
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,156
It's great to meet you too, Paul.
I've heard a lot about you.

623
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,036
He's a pretty big deal, that Paul.

624
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,516
Pretty big deal.

625
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:32,236
He makes his own tapenade! Yeah.

626
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,260
Uh...

627
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,740
Anyway, um... I...

628
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:44,876
have looked up to Naomi
pretty much my entire life.

629
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,836
We met when we were five years old,

630
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:51,020
and right up through to our teenage
years, we made quite the pair.

631
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,036
We'd talk about all the
things girls talk about,

632
00:52:54,060 --> 00:53:00,396
you know, boys, hair, products,
uh... more boys.

633
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:04,036
I mean, I tried sometimes
to expand our range a little

634
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:08,740
and talk about climate change,
but she found that kind of boring so...

635
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,796
Go on.

636
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,716
She was probably right.
I mean, fuck the planet, right?

637
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,316
Whoo!

638
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:19,836
Yes, thank you! Come on.
Let's have a little fun here.

639
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,436
You know, fuck the planet!

640
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,916
Fuck the planet!

641
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:29,700
Anyway...

642
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:37,796
I... looked up to Naomi
pretty much my entire life,

643
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:43,100
which meant she was looking down on me.

644
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,996
Always with a smile though.

645
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:51,636
In high school,
she was my shoulder to cry on.

646
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:56,996
She seemed to enjoy that.
Guys and me never worked out.

647
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:01,580
They'd see Naomi and just... Whoo!
You know, that was it.

648
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:08,356
She had this tight ass,

649
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:11,556
like two fists.

650
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,316
Uh-huh.

651
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:16,436
I was all like...

652
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,556
I was like...

653
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,420
through the hallways in high school.

654
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,540
And she was there for me.

655
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,420
Holding my hair back...

656
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:55,300
as I knelt, vomiting,
in front of the crapper.

657
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,380
Thank you for that, Naomi.

658
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,300
I always wished I was you.

659
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,860
And...

660
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,180
I guess that's why you
kept me around so long?

661
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:21,396
Until you got your new job

662
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:26,380
and your fancy new friends.

663
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,756
And that...

664
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,780
...fucking... jackhole!

665
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:40,116
And you didn't need me.
You probably got another me.

666
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:45,556
Guess there's some other "yeth Beth"
you moved on to like a succubus.

667
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:48,340
I'm getting to Mr. Rags, okay? Jesus!

668
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,100
Stay back.

669
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,636
Stay the fuck back! I'll kill him!

670
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,556
I'll cut his head off
and stick it up my ass!

671
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,396
Time's nearly up!

672
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,596
- Hey! Calm down.
- I...

673
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:09,676
I just wanted to say, in this
world so caught up in our own shit,

674
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,100
- let's not forget what matters.
- It's okay. It's okay.

675
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:19,660
Happiness, fucking Paul
and Naomi, and she's...

676
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:24,260
She... She fucked Greg!

677
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,780
I know she did.

678
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,796
- I know you did.
- No...

679
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:34,156
Don't even try to deny...

680
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:41,996
The little girl who, when we
were just five-years-old in art camp,

681
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:45,700
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared

682
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,876
and helped me make Mr. Rags.

683
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:54,476
He reminds me of you and
what you meant to me then!

684
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:58,060
And I'm so honoured
to be here to see this shit!

685
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:04,180
I love you, Nay-Nay!
I've always loved you!

686
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,540
I love you!

687
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,596
What the fuck are you looking at?

688
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,660
Just what I was wondering.

689
00:59:56,982 --> 00:59:57,702
Well...

690
00:59:59,645 --> 01:00:00,565
Don't!

691
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:04,596
Don't? Don't wonder?

692
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:05,780
Uh-huh.

693
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:08,705
It would be a dull
world without wonder.

694
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:11,524
I don't give a shit about your world.

695
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,260
I don't like your brassiere.

696
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,140
I don't like your moustache.

697
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,396
I don't like your aura.

698
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,660
- My aura?
- Yeah.

699
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:30,236
I don't like your... head.

700
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,996
Your entire head is
just ridiculous to me.

701
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,236
Really?

702
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:40,116
You look like an alcoholic
former weatherman.

703
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,676
You sound like a lost little lamb

704
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,180
that just got told there's no Santa Claus.

705
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:49,196
What sort of cartoon character
did your mum have to fuck

706
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,876
to brew you up in the womb?

707
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,636
At least I look like I was born,

708
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:57,196
not shit out by some tormented cow
creature in an underground lab.

709
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,956
You got tossed out of that lab.

710
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:01,516
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah, flushed out.

711
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:04,436
- Ooh!
- In the trash!

712
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:08,076
- Your face is a fucking...
- Fucking.

713
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:12,036
Fucking biological car crash

714
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,116
that made Picasso screw
his eyes up and say,

715
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,676
"Well, that just don't make sense."

716
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,156
- You're a fucking asshole.
- Fuck you!

717
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,002
- Fuck you next Wednesday.
- Fuck you for Christmas!

718
01:01:23,027 --> 01:01:27,867
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!
