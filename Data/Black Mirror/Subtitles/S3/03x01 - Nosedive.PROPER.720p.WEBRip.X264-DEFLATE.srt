00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:35,239
_

3
00:01:10,514 --> 00:01:13,290
- Hey, Lacie!
- Hey!

4
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:10,810
Ryan?

5
00:02:12,474 --> 00:02:13,754
Ryan!

6
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:23,770
- I was holding a bomb!
- Come on!

7
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:25,370
Sorry, guys.

8
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:31,130
Landlord is sending buyers over
today so... put your pants on.

9
00:02:31,154 --> 00:02:35,490
Maybe if I don't, it'll scare 'em
off and we can stay here.

10
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:38,930
Not an option, Ryan.
Lease is up in four weeks.

11
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:40,994
Hey, I'm thinking of you.
I've got somewhere to go.

12
00:02:41,754 --> 00:02:45,474
Nate's roommate took a job in
Phoenix so I get his place.

13
00:02:46,554 --> 00:02:48,810
- Okay.
- Now who's the slow poke?

14
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:54,274
I'm... seeing some places
over lunch. Catch you later.

15
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:01,514
Sorry, that was my sister.

16
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:05,274
Yeah. Yeah, I bet you'd love to.

17
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:12,914
Jasmine tea?

18
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:26,394
And that's one Brushed Suede.

19
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:29,090
You want a cookie with that?

20
00:03:29,114 --> 00:03:32,714
- It's on the house.
- Sounds awesome.

21
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:40,890
- See you tomorrow, JJ.
- See you, Lacie.

22
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:46,456
Oh, I saw your boy in
the fire hat just now! So cute!

23
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,786
Yeah, he's really something.

24
00:04:35,674 --> 00:04:36,554
Hmm.

25
00:05:13,674 --> 00:05:15,250
Hey, Lacie!

26
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:18,690
- Bets, it's great to see you!
- You too.

27
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:31,530
How's Pancakes?

28
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:35,810
He's hilarious. Such a
funny cat. Just the best.

29
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:42,010
- Are you still at Hoddicker?
- Mm-hmm.

30
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:45,130
- Yeah. It's going pretty great.
- Good to hear.

31
00:05:45,154 --> 00:05:47,370
- So what brings you back here?
- New job, first day.

32
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:49,890
- First day?
- At Blankman-Harper.

33
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:52,810
Whoa! Top floor! That's...

34
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:56,194
- Well, good luck.
- I know, right?

35
00:05:57,554 --> 00:06:00,650
It's great you're still
happy at Hoddicker.

36
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:02,970
- Well, maybe not forever.
- No, not forever.

37
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:04,690
- But for now...
- It's OK for now.

38
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:08,274
It's great for now, yes. Yes, it is.

39
00:07:05,354 --> 00:07:08,290
Lacie, I got you a smoothie.

40
00:07:08,314 --> 00:07:12,074
Got one for everyone, actually.
Still a bunch of them for grabs.

41
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:16,010
They're from the organic
stall at the farmers' market.

42
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:17,514
Sure. Okay.

43
00:07:23,754 --> 00:07:25,834
Mmm!

44
00:07:32,274 --> 00:07:34,274
Thank you. Thank you.

45
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:40,994
We're kind
of not talking to Ches.

46
00:07:42,274 --> 00:07:46,170
- 3.1? What happened?
- Him and Gordon split up.

47
00:07:46,194 --> 00:07:47,690
Oh...

48
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:50,650
- Poor Ches.
- No, no, no, we're all on Gordon's side.

49
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:53,410
Sure! Obviously.

50
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:57,010
Ches is kissing ass.
Trying to scrape himself back.

51
00:07:57,034 --> 00:08:01,490
Of course, if it drops below two-five,
then it's... bye-bye.

52
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:11,929
_

53
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:33,810
Hello?

54
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:36,810
- Yo, they're taking it.
- Who?

55
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:40,130
The couple the landlord sent over.
I heard them talking.

56
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:41,194
Okay.

57
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:48,290
So, now we move into
the light space area.

58
00:08:48,314 --> 00:08:52,250
Ideal for special times with loved ones.

59
00:08:52,274 --> 00:08:56,234
- Great food, great company.
- Mm-hmm!

60
00:08:58,634 --> 00:09:01,450
Whoa!

61
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,954
Sampled your
photo stream to make her.

62
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:06,570
Great hair!

63
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:09,016
Styled free of charge
at the members' salon.

64
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:12,594
Oh, my God.

65
00:09:14,114 --> 00:09:15,890
It's hilarious!

66
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:18,610
You like him?

67
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:21,730
- He's okay.
- He doesn't come with the apartment.

68
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:29,050
But there is a bar and restaurant
on site, tenants only.

69
00:09:29,074 --> 00:09:33,250
We have unparalleled
metrics on romantic geneses.

70
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:34,370
Uh-huh.

71
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:38,116
I gotta say,
these places are going like "that."

72
00:09:38,141 --> 00:09:42,355
- So don't delay if you're interested.
- Oh, I'm more than interested.

73
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:46,235
Standard occupancy on a
minimum six-month contract,

74
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,699
we're talking... this much.

75
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:53,979
- How often are the payments?
- That's weekly.

76
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:56,395
Okay.

77
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:58,395
- A little more than expected?
- Yeah.

78
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,115
There's options.

79
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:02,595
You know our Prime Influencers Programme?

80
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:05,339
- Do I qualify for that?
- No. No, you don't.

81
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:08,539
We'd need you around a 4.5.

82
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:12,595
4.5?

83
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:15,779
Hit 4.5 and there's a 20% discount.

84
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:21,699
- 4.5.
- That's right.

85
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:21,635
Pelican Cove? What is this?
A eugenics programme?

86
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:26,635
- A lifestyle community.
- No one is this happy.

87
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:29,155
A two-year-old with a fucking
balloon isn't this happy.

88
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:32,116
It's actually a pretty cool place.

89
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,979
Like you'd even qualify.

90
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:44,195
There's nothing I can do, sir.

91
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:46,715
Well, it's not hopeless,
you're clearly a tryer.

92
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:50,275
That's the sense you get just from... me?

93
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:52,955
From your rep report analytics.

94
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:56,595
If we drill down into the numbers,
you've got a solid popularity arc here.

95
00:11:56,619 --> 00:12:00,099
Strong overall trajectory.
Let's just look at the last 24 hours.

96
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:01,829
You see, even...

97
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:06,395
What's that? 8:40 a.m. You're
working hard on your socials.

98
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:08,435
- Great little uptake there.
- Okay.

99
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,795
Couple of minor dings there.
You cut someone off in traffic?

100
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:14,715
Oh, just a workplace thing.

101
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:17,755
Okay. Let's check on
your sphere of influence.

102
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,819
Let me zoom out here.

103
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:24,155
Great peripherals.
Strangers like you, that's a plus.

104
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,475
- Healthy inner circle. It's good.
- Thank you.

105
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,379
There's a ways to go,
but 4.5 is certainly achievable.

106
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,292
How long do you think?

107
00:12:34,316 --> 00:12:35,492
- To hit 4.5?
- Mm-hmm.

108
00:12:35,516 --> 00:12:37,572
Well, barring a major setback,

109
00:12:37,596 --> 00:12:41,756
a public disgrace kind of deal,
I'd say 18 months or so.

110
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:47,292
Oh, I need more short term.
Like... much more.

111
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:48,596
Then you'll need a boost.

112
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:51,676
- What kind of a boost?
- Well...

113
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:55,972
Most of your interactions are
confined to your inner circle

114
00:12:55,996 --> 00:13:00,492
and they're largely, pardon the term,
mid-to low-range folks.

115
00:13:00,516 --> 00:13:01,932
Same with your outer circle.

116
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:05,212
You've got a ton of reciprocal five
stars from service industry workers,

117
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:07,172
but there's not much else.

118
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:08,515
At least as far as I can see.

119
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,812
So in terms of quality,
you could use a punch up right there.

120
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:14,996
Ideally, that's up votes
from quality people.

121
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:18,532
- Quality people?
- High fours.

122
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:22,172
Impress those up-scale folks,
you'll gain velocity on your arc

123
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:23,836
and there's your boost.

124
00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:41,396
- Oh, hi, JJ!
- Hey, Lacie!

125
00:13:41,996 --> 00:13:43,556
- Keith! Hello.
- Lacie!

126
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:46,756
- You look great today.
- Thank you!

127
00:13:47,716 --> 00:13:51,953
- Door won't open. I'm on 2.4.
- Sorry, Ches. I'm late.

128
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:53,898
I just need some stars, please!

129
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:56,876
Fuck!

130
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:08,132
- Oh, hi!
- Hi!

131
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:11,492
- How's it going at Blankman?
- Just great.

132
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:16,716
- Well, I bet you work... good there.
- Thank you.

133
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:23,092
Would you like a croissant?

134
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:25,292
They gave me an extra
at the coffee place.

135
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:28,492
- Oh, no, I already ate.
- Okay, sure. All good. Yes.

136
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:29,756
Yeah.

137
00:14:31,796 --> 00:14:36,452
Well, here's me, so...

138
00:14:44,076 --> 00:14:46,972
Don't try too hard.
It's impossible to respect.

139
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:51,492
High fours can smell it
a mile off. Just be you.

140
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,812
Authentic gestures, that's the key.

141
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:57,276
- That's time up, I'll catch you later.
- Oh, could I just ask...

142
00:16:00,436 --> 00:16:04,756
... "Mr. Rags."

143
00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:07,040
_

144
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,491
_

145
00:16:43,756 --> 00:16:45,121
Shit!

146
00:16:54,876 --> 00:16:58,692
- What the fuck is that?
- Tapenade. Want some?

147
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:00,452
Who even are you?

148
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:03,012
It's just something I wanna eat, Ryan.

149
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:08,836
Oh, my God.

150
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:11,996
- What is it?
- Naomi!

151
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:13,796
Shit!

152
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:19,076
Old school, el perfecto Naomi?
You guys keep in contact?

153
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:22,196
Ryan, just go! Go!

154
00:17:28,076 --> 00:17:32,052
- Oh, my God!
- Nay-Nay, how are you?

155
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:34,452
I was just fixing myself a snack.

156
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:39,372
Oh, Lace, could I just say I
am so happy to see your face?

157
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:42,212
- Me too. It's been...
- Too long.

158
00:17:42,236 --> 00:17:44,203
- Way too long.
- And that's my fault.

159
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:47,092
- No, it's mine. Everything is just so...
- Everything's just so...

160
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:50,452
Crazy! Oh, it's so good to see you.

161
00:17:50,476 --> 00:17:54,012
When you posted that
Mr. Rags photo...

162
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:56,012
I know, Mr. Rags!

163
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:58,012
I just had to call

164
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:01,332
and talk to you because...

165
00:18:01,356 --> 00:18:03,332
Whoo-hoo!

166
00:18:05,396 --> 00:18:07,811
Wow! That's a... big ring!

167
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:12,572
Congratulations! Who's the, um... Paul?

168
00:18:12,596 --> 00:18:16,172
He is great. So smart. Just sweet.

169
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:18,012
I know you're gonna love him.

170
00:18:18,036 --> 00:18:19,172
Uh-huh.

171
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:20,932
So, anyways, the big day...

172
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:22,172
Yes, when is it?

173
00:18:22,196 --> 00:18:23,692
So, we're getting married in a month

174
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:24,852
on his family's estate

175
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:26,132
up here on the island.

176
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:28,932
This place outside Port Mary,
Honeysuckle. You heard of it?

177
00:18:28,956 --> 00:18:30,012
No, but...

178
00:18:30,036 --> 00:18:31,932
Well, it's a private island.

179
00:18:31,956 --> 00:18:36,252
Take a looooook!

180
00:18:36,276 --> 00:18:38,532
Oh, wow! That is...

181
00:18:38,556 --> 00:18:43,012
I know, right? So... can you make it?

182
00:18:43,036 --> 00:18:45,476
Are you kidding? Of course.

183
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:48,436
Great, cool,
cos I was wondering if...

184
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:51,956
Lace, do you think...

185
00:18:53,076 --> 00:18:54,476
Would you be my maid of honour?

186
00:18:55,356 --> 00:18:56,463
Seriously?

187
00:18:58,132 --> 00:18:59,212
Oh, my God.

188
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:06,052
I mean, you've got such cool
friends now. Are you sure?

189
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:10,812
Remember when we used to plan our
dream weddings when we were, like, 11?

190
00:19:10,836 --> 00:19:15,451
- I know but we haven't s...
- I don't know, just seeing Mr. Rags...

191
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:19,172
All the memories.
It just brought things home.

192
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:20,332
Oh, Nay-Nay.

193
00:19:20,356 --> 00:19:22,691
I know we haven't kept in touch
as much as I'd have liked

194
00:19:22,716 --> 00:19:25,852
and that is totally my fault,
but this is a big day.

195
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:31,572
A big life day and I want my oldest
friend with me, my oldest friend.

196
00:19:31,596 --> 00:19:33,356
I want you by my side.

197
00:19:34,436 --> 00:19:37,956
Oh, my God. Thank you.

198
00:19:39,092 --> 00:19:40,932
What do I have to...

199
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:43,292
Not much to it. A speech, mainly.

200
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,412
Speech? Of course!

201
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:48,172
Mm-hmm. How big's the crowd?

202
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:50,692
Oh, my gosh, like... hundreds!

203
00:19:50,716 --> 00:19:54,292
It's a crazy guest list. I'll send it now.

204
00:19:54,316 --> 00:19:57,292
Paul's invited so many,
I don't want to call them big deals,

205
00:19:57,316 --> 00:19:59,702
but they're all, like, 4.7 or above.

206
00:20:01,436 --> 00:20:02,716
Uh-huh.

207
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:08,052
Nay-Nay, I will not
let you down.

208
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:12,212
Don't sweat too much!
Just talk about old memories.

209
00:20:12,236 --> 00:20:14,812
- Sure.
- How we were, any old things.

210
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:16,892
- Gotcha.
- I'll ping you some anecdotes.

211
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,132
- That would be great.
- And what's your dress size?

212
00:20:19,156 --> 00:20:20,372
Oh, um...

213
00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:22,532
I'll tell you what,
I'll just send you a four.

214
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,892
- Perfect.
- We got matching bridesmaids dresses.

215
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,772
Well, anyway...

216
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,107
Love you, Lay.

217
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:35,852
You too, Nay-Nay!

218
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:36,676
Oh!

219
00:20:37,556 --> 00:20:38,492
Bye.

220
00:20:44,996 --> 00:20:47,396
What was that? The F-word?

221
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:50,676
You two pussy pals now?

222
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:52,692
Shut up.

223
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:56,052
- She was always mean to you.
- No, she wasn't.

224
00:20:56,076 --> 00:20:59,812
- She had that rhyme about you.
- That was a game.

225
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:03,252
- What about when she cut your hair?
- I asked her to.

226
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:04,892
She fucked Greg.

227
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:09,876
She... did not fuck Greg.

228
00:21:14,956 --> 00:21:16,756
She looked hot. I'll give her that.

229
00:21:23,903 --> 00:21:24,983
Okay.

230
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:28,476
Impressive.

231
00:21:31,116 --> 00:21:35,932
- Uh-huh. Jesus. Yeah, that'd do it.
- Mm-hmm.

232
00:21:37,436 --> 00:21:38,732
Pelican Cove.

233
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:42,932
Carole, it's Lacie. Saw the
place yesterday. I wanna take it.

234
00:21:42,956 --> 00:21:44,772
That's fantastic!

235
00:21:44,796 --> 00:21:48,732
Uh... Oh, I see you're still
on a 4.2. Is that, um...

236
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:52,652
Yep, I'm on it, just gonna
transfer the deposit now.

237
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:54,358
- Well, okay.
- Yes!

238
00:21:55,533 --> 00:22:00,356
In this world, we're all so
caught up in our own heads.

239
00:22:02,036 --> 00:22:07,436
It's easy to lose sight of
what's real. What matters.

240
00:22:09,756 --> 00:22:11,956
But as I stand here today...

241
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:18,316
seeing the joy Paul has
brought to Naomi's life,

242
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:24,036
I know she's someone
who truly matters to me.

243
00:22:26,676 --> 00:22:28,236
Nay-Nay,

244
00:22:28,756 --> 00:22:34,532
the little girl who, when we were
just five-years-old in art camp,

245
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:39,756
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared.

246
00:22:41,716 --> 00:22:47,716
The girl who helped me make
Mr. Rags. I still have him.

247
00:22:48,996 --> 00:22:50,956
He sits on my desk and...

248
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:55,676
every day, he reminds me of Nay-Nay.

249
00:22:57,836 --> 00:23:01,436
What she meant to me then and now.

250
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,636
I am so honored to be here

251
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:13,796
and I wish you all the happiness
this stupid world can muster.

252
00:23:16,516 --> 00:23:18,716
I love you, Nay-Nay.

253
00:23:20,516 --> 00:23:21,996
Is the tear too much?

254
00:23:22,956 --> 00:23:25,972
You fucking sociopath.

255
00:23:25,996 --> 00:23:31,052
- Ryan, my car's here. Was it too much?
- What, the tear, the photo, Mr. Rags?

256
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,012
I do keep him on my desk.

257
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,932
There's sugary and then
there's fucking diabetes.

258
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,812
I just wanna make her
happy on her wedding day.

259
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:41,812
The captive audience of 4-point
holies five-starring your ass off,

260
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:42,972
that's just a bonus.

261
00:23:42,996 --> 00:23:46,332
- Naomi and I were best friends.
- Come on...

262
00:23:46,356 --> 00:23:49,292
I wish her well and wanna
express it the best I can.

263
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,812
And, yeah, if I nail a speech
and get five-starred

264
00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:54,292
by hundreds of primes, so what?
It's a win-win.

265
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:58,577
What are you hoping for? Like, 4.3, 4.4?

266
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:01,658
Unh-unh. You get points
from your gaming buddies.

267
00:24:01,682 --> 00:24:04,338
It's the same thing.
Don't shit on me for aiming higher.

268
00:24:04,362 --> 00:24:05,658
Pelican Cove higher?

269
00:24:05,682 --> 00:24:08,578
What's wrong with Pelican Cove?
They're great apartments!

270
00:24:08,602 --> 00:24:11,578
They are fake-smile jail cells.

271
00:24:11,602 --> 00:24:13,642
Great. Car cancelled.

272
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,121
And he marked me down so now I have
to book another, and I took a ding.

273
00:24:17,196 --> 00:24:20,892
- Great job.
- I am sorry, but I miss the normal you.

274
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:25,012
Before this obsession, when we
had conversations, remember?

275
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:26,092
I need my charger.

276
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:30,612
This whole ranking thing, just
comparing yourself to people who...

277
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,852
- Have you seen my charger?
- ...only pretend to be happy.

278
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:36,636
I said don't borrow this!

279
00:24:37,196 --> 00:24:40,892
High fours like Naomi,
I bet they're suicidal on the inside.

280
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,612
My car is here. Again.

281
00:24:42,636 --> 00:24:44,812
Your Pelican Cove deposit,
is it refundable?

282
00:24:44,836 --> 00:24:46,292
Like, what if this doesn't work?

283
00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:49,332
- Can't you just stay out of my shit?
- You're my sister!

284
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:52,172
Yes! And if you cared about that,
maybe you would've noticed

285
00:24:52,196 --> 00:24:56,116
living with you hasn't been one
big rainbow sandwich for me.

286
00:24:57,076 --> 00:24:59,852
Do you know why I never
brought any guys back here?

287
00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:03,412
Because I didn't want them to know
I was sharing a skanky-ass cave

288
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:06,476
with Mr. Three Point Fuck.

289
00:25:08,236 --> 00:25:09,916
Good luck with your performance!

290
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:45,956
Oh, hi, hi! I'm coming. I'm coming.

291
00:25:47,116 --> 00:25:49,492
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

292
00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:51,556
That's great. Just great.

293
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,636
Oh... Hi.

294
00:26:10,116 --> 00:26:12,852
Nay-Nay!

295
00:26:12,876 --> 00:26:14,972
Hey, Lace! Just checking in.

296
00:26:14,996 --> 00:26:18,172
I'm on my way to the
airport right now.

297
00:26:18,196 --> 00:26:20,532
Okay, cool, and you're all
good for the rehearsal dinner?

298
00:26:20,556 --> 00:26:25,412
Oh, yeah. The flight's, what, an hour?
That restaurant looks so cool.

299
00:26:25,436 --> 00:26:29,332
- Uh-huh. And you got the dress okay?
- Mm-hmm. In my case.

300
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:30,692
- I love the pink.
- Uh-huh.

301
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:34,772
So the latest draft of
the speech is great.

302
00:26:34,796 --> 00:26:36,812
Going handwritten's so cool.

303
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:40,452
Those scans of the page, my God,
I welled up just at that.

304
00:26:40,476 --> 00:26:43,996
- Oh, thank you!
- Um... just one thought.

305
00:26:44,596 --> 00:26:47,132
That whole bit where I help you
with the eating disorder thing...

306
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:49,372
- You think that's a little...
- A little over-sharing, yeah.

307
00:26:49,396 --> 00:26:51,412
You're so right. It's gone.

308
00:26:51,436 --> 00:26:54,372
Okay. Cool. Well, I'll
see you in a few hours!

309
00:26:54,396 --> 00:26:56,332
♪ I'm getting married tomorrow ♪

310
00:27:09,516 --> 00:27:13,201
And here's your tip. Thank you.

311
00:27:16,316 --> 00:27:18,116
Oh, come on.

312
00:27:19,156 --> 00:27:21,596
May I
have your attention, please...

313
00:27:29,262 --> 00:27:32,518
- Hi there, how are you doing?
- I am wonderful.

314
00:27:35,396 --> 00:27:38,356
I am so sorry, that flight is cancelled.

315
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:42,796
- No. No, no, no.
- Customer incident at the other end.

316
00:27:43,436 --> 00:27:46,252
But... So when is the next flight?

317
00:27:46,276 --> 00:27:49,332
Yeah, they're all kind of full.

318
00:27:49,356 --> 00:27:53,012
Uh... I booked this weeks ago.
It's my best friend's wedding.

319
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:55,172
- I'm sorry.
- I have to get there. I have to.

320
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:57,092
Okay... let's see what we can do.

321
00:27:57,116 --> 00:27:59,156
Thank you. Thank you so much.

322
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:08,812
I see there's one standby seat
on another plane leaving tonight.

323
00:28:08,836 --> 00:28:10,436
Uh...

324
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:14,092
That's reserved for members
of our Prime Flight Programme.

325
00:28:14,116 --> 00:28:16,092
You gotta be a 4.2 or over to qualify.

326
00:28:16,116 --> 00:28:18,452
- Oh, I'm... I'm a 4.2.
- Uh-huh.

327
00:28:18,476 --> 00:28:21,807
I'm afraid you're actually a 4.183.

328
00:28:24,756 --> 00:28:27,892
Oh. Well, that's not my fault. Um...

329
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:30,532
Some woman dinged me
down in the... Can't you just...

330
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:33,052
I'm sorry, it won't let me book
it without the correct ranking.

331
00:28:33,076 --> 00:28:35,172
- But it's so close.
- There's just nothing I can do.

332
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:36,932
- Christ, I mean, surely.
- I'm gonna have to ask you

333
00:28:36,956 --> 00:28:39,012
to moderate your language there.

334
00:28:39,036 --> 00:28:40,356
Sorry. It's just...

335
00:28:42,316 --> 00:28:46,372
I'm maid of honour.
I cannot miss this wedding.

336
00:28:46,396 --> 00:28:49,316
And I am so sorry about that.

337
00:28:52,476 --> 00:28:54,212
- Can you call the supervisor?
- I cannot do that.

338
00:28:54,236 --> 00:28:55,852
- Can you just call the supervisor?
- I cannot do that.

339
00:28:55,876 --> 00:28:57,772
- Call the fucking supervisor!
- Okay, that's profanity.

340
00:28:57,796 --> 00:29:00,452
- We're zero tolerance on profanity.
- I'm sorry. It's just...

341
00:29:00,476 --> 00:29:02,772
- I have to serve the next customer.
- No, no, no, no.

342
00:29:02,796 --> 00:29:05,972
- Can you step away, ma'am?
- God, just fucking help me!

343
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:07,052
Ooh.

344
00:29:09,076 --> 00:29:10,396
I'm so sorry.

345
00:29:11,196 --> 00:29:15,532
- I've called security.
- Oh, no, no, no. Please don't do that.

346
00:29:15,557 --> 00:29:18,872
I'm, uh... five-starring you. Five stars.

347
00:29:18,896 --> 00:29:21,092
- What's the issue here, Hannah?
- Intimidation and profanity.

348
00:29:21,116 --> 00:29:23,492
- Oh, no, no. I was not intimidating.
- Don't speak, ma'am.

349
00:29:23,516 --> 00:29:25,236
- I was just trying to...
- Ma'am.

350
00:29:27,076 --> 00:29:29,892
Okay. So, in order to restore calm,

351
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:32,212
I'm invoking my authority
as airport security

352
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:35,212
to dock you one full ranking
point as a punitive measure.

353
00:29:35,236 --> 00:29:37,132
- This is a temporary measure.
- No!

354
00:29:37,156 --> 00:29:38,884
Your score reverts
to normal in 24 hours.

355
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:39,852
No, no, no. But I need it now.

356
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:43,372
During this period, all down votes
are subject to a times two multiplier.

357
00:29:43,396 --> 00:29:44,492
Times two?

358
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,572
We recommend you avoid
negative feedback at this time.

359
00:29:46,596 --> 00:29:47,652
I'm on double damage?

360
00:29:47,676 --> 00:29:51,850
Please, remove yourself
from the airport immediately.

361
00:30:14,516 --> 00:30:16,092
Okay, well, due to your ranking...

362
00:30:37,996 --> 00:30:40,972
Hi there. Chuck! Great name.

363
00:30:40,996 --> 00:30:43,812
- Thank you.
- Hope you're having a great night.

364
00:30:43,836 --> 00:30:46,572
- It's pretty good.
- So I need a car.

365
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:49,732
- You got a vehicle in mind?
- Anything, really.

366
00:30:49,756 --> 00:30:52,452
Well, due to your current ranking,

367
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,292
you're restricted to
our super saver fleet.

368
00:30:55,316 --> 00:30:58,252
- Yep. That's... Yeah.
- I-Cruiser 2?

369
00:30:58,276 --> 00:31:00,276
They still have the 2?

370
00:31:24,036 --> 00:31:27,452
Oh, God.

371
00:31:44,476 --> 00:31:47,052
Oh, come on.

372
00:31:47,076 --> 00:31:48,852
Uh...

373
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:55,756
Damn it!

374
00:32:17,316 --> 00:32:21,756
The little girl, who when we were
both five years old in art camp,

375
00:32:21,876 --> 00:32:25,796
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared.

376
00:32:27,316 --> 00:32:30,676
The girl who helped me make Mr. Rags...

377
00:32:33,476 --> 00:32:38,372
Teardrop. Crowd goes wild. You can do this.

378
00:32:44,116 --> 00:32:48,156
- Sorry, okay, I swear I'm on my way.
- How far away are you?

379
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:52,732
Uh... Quite a ways. I missed my flight.

380
00:32:52,756 --> 00:32:55,332
- What?
- Well, not missed it but...

381
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:57,196
So you're not gonna make
the rehearsal dinner?

382
00:32:58,236 --> 00:32:59,612
- No.
- Lacie!

383
00:32:59,636 --> 00:33:02,476
I am so sorry. It's been...

384
00:33:02,996 --> 00:33:05,492
I got a rental car. I'm driving.

385
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:09,412
Driving? That's like nine hours.

386
00:33:09,436 --> 00:33:10,812
I'm making good time,

387
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:14,332
gonna go through the night,
make a road trip out of it.

388
00:33:14,356 --> 00:33:15,716
Is everything okay?

389
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:18,532
I can find a replacement
if something's wrong.

390
00:33:18,556 --> 00:33:21,532
No. No. No. I'll be there.
I swear on Mr. Rags.

391
00:33:21,556 --> 00:33:23,012
Ha ha ha!

392
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:25,132
Okay, just drive safe!

393
00:33:25,156 --> 00:33:26,812
You bet. I'll just...

394
00:33:35,876 --> 00:33:37,276
Come on.

395
00:33:39,676 --> 00:33:40,852
Come on.

396
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:42,156
Please.

397
00:33:48,796 --> 00:33:49,876
Okay.

398
00:34:16,636 --> 00:34:20,252
What do you want?

399
00:34:24,956 --> 00:34:28,916
Oh, shit.

400
00:35:01,076 --> 00:35:03,036
Hi. Sorry.

401
00:35:07,716 --> 00:35:09,876
Your charger doesn't fit my car.

402
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,516
- Don't see those around much these days.
- It's a rental.

403
00:35:17,356 --> 00:35:21,556
Ours chargers are Q2Z, yours one's a K1.
They didn't give you an adapter?

404
00:35:22,116 --> 00:35:25,316
No. Do you have one?

405
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:31,132
- Not in here. Ask around.
- Thanks, anyway.

406
00:35:31,156 --> 00:35:33,196
You're super helpful.

407
00:35:45,756 --> 00:35:46,996
Two stars?!

408
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:49,332
Two stars?

409
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,476
Wasn't a meaningful encounter.

410
00:35:55,076 --> 00:35:56,972
Sir, excuse me.

411
00:35:56,996 --> 00:35:58,732
Excuse me, sorry.

412
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:02,436
Do you have a K1 adapter, by any chance?

413
00:36:03,556 --> 00:36:08,156
Ma'am, how about you, a K1 adapter,
perhaps, in the trunk of your car?

414
00:36:09,356 --> 00:36:10,585
Sure.

415
00:36:12,076 --> 00:36:13,156
Great.

416
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:17,876
Oh, ma'am, hi. Do you have a K1 adapter?

417
00:36:18,436 --> 00:36:21,196
I have a rental car. It's...

418
00:37:06,596 --> 00:37:10,996
- Slow down. Let's give her a ride.
- She's, like, 2.8.

419
00:37:12,956 --> 00:37:14,196
Come on!

420
00:37:21,316 --> 00:37:23,036
I didn't even do anything!

421
00:37:43,236 --> 00:37:45,436
You look like you need a ride.

422
00:37:46,676 --> 00:37:48,292
Um...

423
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:51,116
Actually, I'm okay.

424
00:37:53,716 --> 00:37:58,756
Don't look it. Come on. I don't bite.

425
00:38:01,636 --> 00:38:06,132
Luther, Mrs. Coffee, reds,
whiskey. Help yourself.

426
00:38:06,156 --> 00:38:07,996
I'm okay. Thanks.

427
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,492
Where are you headed?

428
00:38:10,516 --> 00:38:15,316
Uh... Just as close as you can get
to Port Mary would be great.

429
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:26,836
Checking my feed for danger signs?

430
00:38:28,996 --> 00:38:33,916
I get it a lot. 1.4 gotta be
an antisocial maniac, right?

431
00:38:34,716 --> 00:38:37,252
- You seem...
- Normal?

432
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:39,476
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

433
00:38:41,076 --> 00:38:45,556
It took some effort.
What happened to you?

434
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:50,372
I mean, you're a 2.8,
but you don't look 2.8.

435
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:52,052
That's not... This is temporary.

436
00:38:52,076 --> 00:38:54,252
- I'm gonna turn it around.
- Uh-huh.

437
00:38:54,276 --> 00:38:57,492
- I'm going to a wedding. Maid of honour.
- Nice.

438
00:38:57,516 --> 00:38:59,076
Wanna hear my speech?

439
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:00,876
No.

440
00:39:04,596 --> 00:39:06,932
So how come you're a 2.8?

441
00:39:06,956 --> 00:39:10,452
Well, I got marked down
at the airport for yelling,

442
00:39:10,476 --> 00:39:13,132
and they put me on double damage.

443
00:39:13,156 --> 00:39:16,316
- How did it feel?
- Awful.

444
00:39:17,196 --> 00:39:18,636
I meant the yelling.

445
00:39:20,356 --> 00:39:22,556
I don't know. I was mad.

446
00:39:23,436 --> 00:39:25,636
Look at where it got me.

447
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:30,852
But as long as I get to the
wedding, do the speech,

448
00:39:30,876 --> 00:39:33,332
they'll overlook the
2.8. I'm with the bride.

449
00:39:33,356 --> 00:39:35,412
And if I do well, well,
they're all high fours

450
00:39:35,436 --> 00:39:36,692
so that velocitates my arc.

451
00:39:36,716 --> 00:39:40,372
And once they lift the point penalty,
well, my average goes way up,

452
00:39:40,396 --> 00:39:42,956
and, yeah, it's gonna be okay.

453
00:39:46,196 --> 00:39:48,292
God, you remind me of me.

454
00:39:48,316 --> 00:39:50,756
- Hmm.
- Not now.

455
00:39:52,636 --> 00:39:56,316
I was, uh... 4.6 once.

456
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,116
- 4.6?
- Used to live for it.

457
00:40:02,396 --> 00:40:04,716
All the work I put in...

458
00:40:07,596 --> 00:40:10,932
Eight years ago, Tom,
my husband, got cancer.

459
00:40:10,956 --> 00:40:16,196
It was pancreatic. It was a real bitch.
The symptoms showed up late.

460
00:40:17,236 --> 00:40:18,756
I'm so sorry.

461
00:40:19,956 --> 00:40:22,252
You don't know me so
you're not really sorry.

462
00:40:22,276 --> 00:40:26,516
You're just mainly awkward cos I
have sprung some cancer talk at you.

463
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:30,132
Anyway, I five-starred every doctor,

464
00:40:30,156 --> 00:40:34,772
every nurse, every high-four
consultant that we had.

465
00:40:34,796 --> 00:40:36,612
Ding. Ding. Ding. Thank you so much.

466
00:40:36,636 --> 00:40:39,356
The cancer didn't give a shit.
It just kept growing.

467
00:40:40,436 --> 00:40:44,532
A couple of months in, we heard
about this experimental treatment.

468
00:40:44,556 --> 00:40:48,236
It was very expensive.
It was very exclusive.

469
00:40:49,276 --> 00:40:53,236
I did everything I could
to get him a spot there.

470
00:40:54,556 --> 00:40:57,716
Tom was a 4.3.

471
00:40:59,676 --> 00:41:02,196
They gave his bed to a 4.4.

472
00:41:07,196 --> 00:41:11,356
So when he died I thought, fuck it.

473
00:41:13,076 --> 00:41:15,812
I started saying what I wanted,
when I wanted.

474
00:41:15,836 --> 00:41:17,316
Just drop it out there.

475
00:41:18,396 --> 00:41:19,876
People don't always like that.

476
00:41:20,836 --> 00:41:24,212
It is incredible how fast
you slip off the ladder

477
00:41:24,236 --> 00:41:25,972
when you start doing that.

478
00:41:25,996 --> 00:41:30,516
It turned out a lot of my
friends didn't care for honesty.

479
00:41:32,596 --> 00:41:36,892
Treated me like I had taken a
shit at their breakfast table.

480
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:40,972
But, Jesus Christ, it felt good.

481
00:41:40,996 --> 00:41:43,476
Shedding those fuckers.

482
00:41:44,556 --> 00:41:47,236
It was like taking off tight shoes.

483
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:50,972
- Maybe you should try it?
- Oh, come on.

484
00:41:50,996 --> 00:41:52,332
Why not?

485
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:57,052
I can't just kick off my shoes
and walk the earth or whatever.

486
00:41:57,076 --> 00:42:00,436
- You won't know unless you try.
- Oh, that's just...

487
00:42:02,796 --> 00:42:05,812
Look, you had something with your life,

488
00:42:05,836 --> 00:42:11,572
real things, good things,
and you lost it all, and I'm sorry.

489
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:16,212
So now you've got nothing left to lose.

490
00:42:16,236 --> 00:42:19,132
But I don't even have the
something worth losing, not yet.

491
00:42:19,156 --> 00:42:22,596
You know, I mean,
I'm still fighting for that.

492
00:42:24,436 --> 00:42:29,796
- And what is "that"?
- I don't know. Enough to be content?

493
00:42:30,876 --> 00:42:36,156
Like, to look around and think,
well, I guess I'm okay.

494
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:41,756
Just to be able to breathe out,
not feeling like... like...

495
00:42:43,076 --> 00:42:49,172
Like just... And that is
way off, like, way, way off.

496
00:42:49,196 --> 00:42:52,036
And until I get there, I have
to play the numbers game.

497
00:42:52,676 --> 00:42:56,836
We all do, that's what we're in.
That's how the fucking world works.

498
00:42:58,396 --> 00:43:02,876
Look, maybe you don't remember,
you know, you're just too old to get it.

499
00:43:04,956 --> 00:43:06,956
I do not mean that how it sounds.

500
00:43:09,276 --> 00:43:11,996
Don't worry. I'm not voting you down.

501
00:43:36,716 --> 00:43:40,172
- Sweetheart.
- What time is it?

502
00:43:40,196 --> 00:43:44,492
I'm heading east from here so I think
you need to get yourself another ride.

503
00:43:44,516 --> 00:43:47,652
- Where are we?
- About 30 miles from Port Mary.

504
00:43:47,676 --> 00:43:50,972
A lot of buses stop here
so you should be fine.

505
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:54,292
- Well, thank you.
- Good luck with your speech.

506
00:43:56,836 --> 00:43:59,692
I put a little something in there for you.

507
00:43:59,716 --> 00:44:03,272
- You did?
- Emergency escape hatch!

508
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:07,476
Bye.

509
00:44:22,236 --> 00:44:25,572
In this world,
we're all so caught up...

510
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,812
...in our own dramas.

511
00:44:27,836 --> 00:44:31,052
- So, Dad was like...
- It's easy to forget what matters.

512
00:44:31,076 --> 00:44:32,651
He'd never even heard of the show.

513
00:44:32,675 --> 00:44:34,692
I'm like, "You never heard of
Sea of Tranquillity?"

514
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:37,412
Like, the number-one sci-fi fantasy,

515
00:44:37,436 --> 00:44:39,412
and he's all like,
"What the fuck?" Whatever!

516
00:44:39,436 --> 00:44:41,652
I think I'm allergic to this purple.

517
00:44:41,676 --> 00:44:44,972
So I'm like, "Well, I'm going
to Tranquillity Con in Port Mary.

518
00:44:44,996 --> 00:44:47,652
That's why I'm dressed
like Lieutenant Duster."

519
00:44:47,676 --> 00:44:50,572
He's all like, "Uh...
Port Mary is frickin' miles away."

520
00:44:50,596 --> 00:44:51,692
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

521
00:44:51,716 --> 00:44:56,572
He one-stars me. Like, thanks, Dad.

522
00:44:56,596 --> 00:44:59,996
- See you back on there.
- Okay.

523
00:45:03,676 --> 00:45:07,652
Are you guys headed to Tranquillity Con?

524
00:45:07,676 --> 00:45:10,692
- You're into Sea of Tranquillity?
- Totally.

525
00:45:10,716 --> 00:45:12,292
I was all set to go.

526
00:45:12,316 --> 00:45:18,036
My friend, who is there already,
has my costume, but my car broke down.

527
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,396
Well, there's some space in the RV.

528
00:45:30,356 --> 00:45:32,412
- Hi.
- Hey!

529
00:45:32,436 --> 00:45:34,572
- You're a Trank head, huh?
- Sorry?

530
00:45:34,596 --> 00:45:36,892
Trank head. Sea of Tranquillity fan?

531
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:40,532
Oh, yeah. We say Tranksters where I'm from.

532
00:45:40,556 --> 00:45:44,172
- Who's your favourite character?
- Gotta be Lieutenant Duster.

533
00:45:44,196 --> 00:45:46,012
- She's awesome.
- She?

534
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:48,292
He! I misspoke.

535
00:45:48,316 --> 00:45:51,052
Lieutenant Duster has no fixed gender.

536
00:45:51,076 --> 00:45:54,652
I know, and that's why it's
so hard to remember, right?

537
00:45:54,676 --> 00:45:56,692
Excuse me. Gotta get this.

538
00:45:56,716 --> 00:45:59,396
My friend, at the convention.

539
00:46:01,636 --> 00:46:03,532
Hi, Nay!

540
00:46:03,556 --> 00:46:08,892
So, oh, my God, insane night,
but I am so close now.

541
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:10,492
Don't come.

542
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:14,092
What? No. No. I'm, like, an hour away.

543
00:46:14,116 --> 00:46:16,132
Don't come. I don't want you here.

544
00:46:16,156 --> 00:46:19,732
I don't know what is up with you,
but I cannot have a 2.6 at my wedding.

545
00:46:19,756 --> 00:46:23,092
Oh, no, that's temporary!
That's temporary.

546
00:46:23,116 --> 00:46:25,412
Well, the wedding's today so...

547
00:46:25,436 --> 00:46:27,972
- But it doesn't change anything.
- Lacie...

548
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:30,172
- I can still do the same speech.
- Lacie...

549
00:46:30,196 --> 00:46:33,492
- And there's Mr. Rags!
- No!

550
00:46:33,516 --> 00:46:36,172
But... But you invited me.

551
00:46:36,196 --> 00:46:38,852
You've seen the guest list.
They are all, like, 4.5 or above.

552
00:46:38,876 --> 00:46:42,292
They are going to freak at a 2.6,
and I am not taking that kind of damage,

553
00:46:42,316 --> 00:46:44,956
plus I haven't dipped under
a 4.7 in, like, six months.

554
00:46:46,516 --> 00:46:50,012
You said you wanted your oldest friend.

555
00:46:50,036 --> 00:46:53,172
When I asked you to speak,
you were a 4.2, okay?

556
00:46:53,196 --> 00:46:56,572
And the authenticity of a vintage bond
low four at a gathering of this calibre

557
00:46:56,596 --> 00:46:59,612
played fantastically on all
the stimulations we ran.

558
00:46:59,636 --> 00:47:01,892
Forecast was a prestige
bounce of 2 minimum.

559
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:05,492
But now you're a sub three. Sorry.

560
00:47:05,516 --> 00:47:07,212
That just puts the stink on
things a little too much.

561
00:47:07,236 --> 00:47:09,412
That just plays badly for us.

562
00:47:09,436 --> 00:47:11,892
So it was just about numbers for you?

563
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:15,052
Oh, cut the shit! It was
numbers for both of us.

564
00:47:15,076 --> 00:47:17,012
You wanted those
primo votes, don't deny it.

565
00:47:17,036 --> 00:47:20,092
It's not like you could get them on
your own. Let's not kid ourselves.

566
00:47:20,116 --> 00:47:22,532
Oh, I'm... I'm getting those votes.

567
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:25,892
What? You're just gonna roll up
here and make people like you?

568
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:30,572
- That's right. I'm doing my speech.
- No, you're not.

569
00:47:30,596 --> 00:47:35,012
Yes, I am. And they are gonna vote me
through the roof when they hear it.

570
00:47:35,036 --> 00:47:40,092
- Weep their fucking eyes out!
- Go home!

571
00:47:40,116 --> 00:47:43,132
Hello?

572
00:47:43,156 --> 00:47:45,716
Fuck!

573
00:47:48,436 --> 00:47:51,556
I have never seen
your stupid fucking show.

574
00:47:57,316 --> 00:47:59,956
Hope they cancel it!

575
00:48:11,156 --> 00:48:13,556
I need a ride!

576
00:48:16,156 --> 00:48:18,796
Fuck!

577
00:48:22,436 --> 00:48:23,916
Jesus!

578
00:48:39,836 --> 00:48:41,996
Hey! Hey!

579
00:48:42,596 --> 00:48:43,636
Hey!

580
00:48:45,596 --> 00:48:48,052
- Can I borrow your bike?
- What?

581
00:48:48,076 --> 00:48:51,252
Can I borrow your bike?

582
00:48:51,276 --> 00:48:56,252
Do you, Naomi Jayne Blestow,
take this man to be your husband,

583
00:48:56,276 --> 00:48:59,196
to live together with him
in the covenant of marriage?

584
00:49:00,116 --> 00:49:02,212
To love him, comfort him,

585
00:49:02,236 --> 00:49:05,892
honour and keep him,
in sickness and in health...

586
00:49:05,916 --> 00:49:09,316
and forsaking all others,
be faithful unto him...

587
00:50:14,116 --> 00:50:17,212
To my best mate, Anthony.
Let's hear it for him.

588
00:50:18,836 --> 00:50:22,292
You've been there from day one.
I love you, man. I appreciate you.

589
00:50:22,316 --> 00:50:25,852
Hilarious speech, by the way.
By your standards.

590
00:50:27,196 --> 00:50:30,092
- Pow! Pow! Pow!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

591
00:50:30,116 --> 00:50:33,772
He's still got a few
bullets left. Oh, man.

592
00:50:33,796 --> 00:50:35,836
Oh, gosh, well, um...

593
00:50:38,556 --> 00:50:39,996
Shit!

594
00:50:40,556 --> 00:50:44,532
We have so many people to
thank. Our beautiful bridesmaids.

595
00:50:44,556 --> 00:50:46,412
But, of course,

596
00:50:46,436 --> 00:50:51,492
my most heartfelt thanks,
my warmest thanks,

597
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:54,796
are to someone who's my best friend,

598
00:50:56,076 --> 00:51:02,972
my lover and now,
I'm honoured to say, my wife.

599
00:51:02,996 --> 00:51:05,516
Naomi!

600
00:51:07,756 --> 00:51:12,836
One, two, three! Naomi!

601
00:51:14,316 --> 00:51:17,172
The A Team!

602
00:51:17,196 --> 00:51:18,612
I love you so much, darl.

603
00:51:18,636 --> 00:51:20,212
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!

604
00:51:20,236 --> 00:51:22,252
Congratulations, sir.

605
00:51:22,276 --> 00:51:24,132
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

606
00:51:24,156 --> 00:51:26,292
Get over here!

607
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:27,892
Get your ass over here.

608
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:30,572
Get in here, big boy.

609
00:51:30,596 --> 00:51:32,636
You're beautiful!

610
00:51:34,596 --> 00:51:37,572
Yeah! Gimme five! Good choice!

611
00:51:37,596 --> 00:51:39,996
You fucking earned it, man.
You fucking earned it.

612
00:51:44,396 --> 00:51:46,212
Everybody, hello!

613
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,276
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.

614
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:56,076
Can everyone be quiet for a moment?

615
00:51:58,196 --> 00:51:59,796
Thank you.

616
00:52:01,156 --> 00:52:03,332
- Get rid of her.
- That would play awful.

617
00:52:03,356 --> 00:52:04,652
She's a fucking 1.1.

618
00:52:04,676 --> 00:52:10,092
Now for those of you who don't
know me, which is... all of you...

619
00:52:10,116 --> 00:52:14,132
my name is Lacie Pound

620
00:52:14,156 --> 00:52:17,996
and, believe it or not,
I am one of Naomi's oldest friends.

621
00:52:18,596 --> 00:52:20,716
Hi, Nay-Nay!

622
00:52:21,996 --> 00:52:25,092
It's great to meet you too, Paul.
I've heard a lot about you.

623
00:52:25,116 --> 00:52:26,972
He's a pretty big deal, that Paul.

624
00:52:26,996 --> 00:52:29,452
Pretty big deal.

625
00:52:29,476 --> 00:52:33,172
He makes his own tapenade! Yeah.

626
00:52:33,196 --> 00:52:35,196
Uh...

627
00:52:37,476 --> 00:52:39,676
Anyway, um... I...

628
00:52:41,356 --> 00:52:45,812
have looked up to Naomi
pretty much my entire life.

629
00:52:45,836 --> 00:52:47,772
We met when we were five years old,

630
00:52:47,796 --> 00:52:51,956
and right up through to our teenage
years, we made quite the pair.

631
00:52:52,676 --> 00:52:54,972
We'd talk about all the
things girls talk about,

632
00:52:54,996 --> 00:53:01,332
you know, boys, hair, products,
uh... more boys.

633
00:53:01,356 --> 00:53:04,972
I mean, I tried sometimes
to expand our range a little

634
00:53:04,996 --> 00:53:09,676
and talk about climate change,
but she found that kind of boring so...

635
00:53:10,316 --> 00:53:11,732
Go on.

636
00:53:11,756 --> 00:53:14,652
She was probably right.
I mean, fuck the planet, right?

637
00:53:14,676 --> 00:53:16,252
Whoo!

638
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:20,772
Yes, thank you! Come on.
Let's have a little fun here.

639
00:53:20,796 --> 00:53:23,372
You know, fuck the planet!

640
00:53:23,396 --> 00:53:25,852
Fuck the planet!

641
00:53:28,676 --> 00:53:30,636
Anyway...

642
00:53:31,716 --> 00:53:38,732
I... looked up to Naomi
pretty much my entire life,

643
00:53:38,756 --> 00:53:44,036
which meant she was looking down on me.

644
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:47,932
Always with a smile though.

645
00:53:47,956 --> 00:53:52,572
In high school,
she was my shoulder to cry on.

646
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:57,932
She seemed to enjoy that.
Guys and me never worked out.

647
00:53:57,956 --> 00:54:02,516
They'd see Naomi and just... Whoo!
You know, that was it.

648
00:54:03,396 --> 00:54:09,292
She had this tight ass,

649
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:12,492
like two fists.

650
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:14,252
Uh-huh.

651
00:54:14,276 --> 00:54:17,372
I was all like...

652
00:54:20,956 --> 00:54:23,492
I was like...

653
00:54:23,516 --> 00:54:25,356
through the hallways in high school.

654
00:54:43,756 --> 00:54:45,476
And she was there for me.

655
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:49,356
Holding my hair back...

656
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:56,236
as I knelt, vomiting,
in front of the crapper.

657
00:55:00,836 --> 00:55:04,316
Thank you for that, Naomi.

658
00:55:07,356 --> 00:55:09,236
I always wished I was you.

659
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:12,796
And...

660
00:55:13,756 --> 00:55:16,116
I guess that's why you
kept me around so long?

661
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,332
Until you got your new job

662
00:55:22,356 --> 00:55:27,316
and your fancy new friends.

663
00:55:29,276 --> 00:55:31,692
And that...

664
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:36,716
...fucking... jackhole!

665
00:55:37,636 --> 00:55:41,052
And you didn't need me.
You probably got another me.

666
00:55:41,076 --> 00:55:46,492
Guess there's some other "yeth Beth"
you moved on to like a succubus.

667
00:55:46,516 --> 00:55:49,276
I'm getting to Mr. Rags, okay? Jesus!

668
00:55:50,116 --> 00:55:53,036
Stay back.

669
00:55:54,516 --> 00:55:57,572
Stay the fuck back! I'll kill him!

670
00:55:57,596 --> 00:55:59,492
I'll cut his head off
and stick it up my ass!

671
00:56:01,836 --> 00:56:04,332
Time's nearly up!

672
00:56:04,356 --> 00:56:05,532
- Hey! Calm down.
- I...

673
00:56:05,556 --> 00:56:10,612
I just wanted to say, in this
world so caught up in our own shit,

674
00:56:10,636 --> 00:56:14,036
- let's not forget what matters.
- It's okay. It's okay.

675
00:56:14,716 --> 00:56:20,596
Happiness, fucking Paul
and Naomi, and she's...

676
00:56:21,076 --> 00:56:25,196
She... She fucked Greg!

677
00:56:26,956 --> 00:56:28,716
I know she did.

678
00:56:29,796 --> 00:56:32,732
- I know you did.
- No...

679
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,092
Don't even try to deny...

680
00:56:37,516 --> 00:56:42,932
The little girl who, when we
were just five-years-old in art camp,

681
00:56:42,956 --> 00:56:46,636
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared

682
00:56:47,316 --> 00:56:49,812
and helped me make Mr. Rags.

683
00:56:49,836 --> 00:56:55,412
He reminds me of you and
what you meant to me then!

684
00:56:55,436 --> 00:56:58,996
And I'm so honoured
to be here to see this shit!

685
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:05,116
I love you, Nay-Nay!
I've always loved you!

686
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:08,476
I love you!

687
00:59:53,676 --> 00:59:55,532
What the fuck are you looking at?

688
00:59:55,556 --> 00:59:57,596
Just what I was wondering.

689
00:59:57,918 --> 00:59:58,638
Well...

690
01:00:00,581 --> 01:00:01,501
Don't!

691
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:05,532
Don't? Don't wonder?

692
01:00:05,556 --> 01:00:06,716
Uh-huh.

693
01:00:07,316 --> 01:00:09,641
It would be a dull
world without wonder.

694
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:12,460
I don't give a shit about your world.

695
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,196
I don't like your brassiere.

696
01:00:18,596 --> 01:00:20,076
I don't like your moustache.

697
01:00:21,476 --> 01:00:23,332
I don't like your aura.

698
01:00:23,356 --> 01:00:25,596
- My aura?
- Yeah.

699
01:00:27,316 --> 01:00:31,172
I don't like your... head.

700
01:00:31,196 --> 01:00:33,932
Your entire head is
just ridiculous to me.

701
01:00:33,956 --> 01:00:35,172
Really?

702
01:00:35,196 --> 01:00:41,052
You look like an alcoholic
former weatherman.

703
01:00:41,076 --> 01:00:43,612
You sound like a lost little lamb

704
01:00:43,636 --> 01:00:46,116
that just got told there's no Santa Claus.

705
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:50,132
What sort of cartoon character
did your mum have to fuck

706
01:00:50,156 --> 01:00:51,812
to brew you up in the womb?

707
01:00:51,836 --> 01:00:53,572
At least I look like I was born,

708
01:00:53,596 --> 01:00:58,132
not shit out by some tormented cow
creature in an underground lab.

709
01:00:58,156 --> 01:00:59,892
You got tossed out of that lab.

710
01:00:59,916 --> 01:01:02,452
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah, flushed out.

711
01:01:02,476 --> 01:01:05,372
- Ooh!
- In the trash!

712
01:01:05,396 --> 01:01:09,012
- Your face is a fucking...
- Fucking.

713
01:01:09,036 --> 01:01:12,972
Fucking biological car crash

714
01:01:12,996 --> 01:01:15,052
that made Picasso screw
his eyes up and say,

715
01:01:15,076 --> 01:01:16,612
"Well, that just don't make sense."

716
01:01:18,436 --> 01:01:21,092
- You're a fucking asshole.
- Fuck you!

717
01:01:21,116 --> 01:01:23,938
- Fuck you next Wednesday.
- Fuck you for Christmas!

718
01:01:23,963 --> 01:01:28,803
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

719
