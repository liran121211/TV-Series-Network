00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:49,524
I'm gonna have to ask you
to switch that off for now.

4
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:50,767
Okay, thanks.

5
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:09,884
You know what it's kinda like?
It's kinda like a rollercoaster.

6
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:13,204
You know what I mean?
It's like a roller coaster.

7
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:17,727
Try it, try it with me.

8
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:48,767
How tall... How tall is the Eye?

9
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:56,607
How tall... How tall is Big Ben?

11
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:31,461
Since then, I've been working
as a technology correspondent

12
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:33,421
for about two years now. It's been great.

13
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:37,061
Cool, that's awesome. So you do, like,
TV reports and, like, you're like...

14
00:04:37,064 --> 00:04:39,341
- No, just the website.
- Oh, just the website?

15
00:04:39,344 --> 00:04:42,981
I mean, there's some video stuff,
but tech industry pieces mainly.

16
00:04:42,984 --> 00:04:45,221
Cool, tech. Tech's awesome. Tech's...

17
00:04:45,224 --> 00:04:47,421
So where have you been so far?

18
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:50,261
Travelling around the
map like Indiana Jones?

19
00:04:50,264 --> 00:04:51,701
- Yeah.
- Where the adventure line

20
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:53,861
goes zigzagging all over the place.

21
00:04:53,864 --> 00:04:57,141
Yeah, actually, I'm almost done. Uh...

22
00:04:57,144 --> 00:05:00,941
But I started off, flew into
Sydney, went to Thailand.

23
00:05:00,944 --> 00:05:03,781
- Oh, jealous.
- India. Yeah.

24
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:05,461
Did Rome, went to Rome.

25
00:05:05,464 --> 00:05:08,341
- Did the whole Europe vacation.
- Even I haven't done that.

26
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:09,581
- Oh, really?
- Mm.

27
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:12,981
It was awesome. I went
to Pamplona in Spain.

28
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:15,341
- Is that where they do the bull runs?
- Ran with the bulls.

29
00:05:15,344 --> 00:05:17,261
- You ran with the bulls?
- I ran with the bulls.

30
00:05:17,264 --> 00:05:19,061
- That's how I got this.
- Look at that!

31
00:05:19,064 --> 00:05:20,461
You really are Indiana Jones.

32
00:05:20,464 --> 00:05:22,581
Have you got your whip
in your bag and your hat?

33
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:25,061
I saved the world from the Nazis.
That was pretty cool.

34
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:28,941
I, you know, just... trying to do,
you know, shit I've never done before.

35
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:32,384
Is that what you're doing on this trip?
You're, like, finding yourself?

36
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:37,184
Yeah, um... in a way. I mean, I...

37
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:41,581
Really to get away from the
family home is what I'm doing.

38
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:42,861
Oh.

39
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:46,821
Yeah, that was...
Whatever, that's boring.

40
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:49,301
Yeah, well, I'm afraid
Britain's pretty tame

41
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:51,581
as far as daredevil opportunities go.

42
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,581
Yeah? It's alright, it's the last
leg of the trip anyway so...

43
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:58,181
I'm... unfortunately home next week.

44
00:05:58,184 --> 00:05:59,781
- Not much time...
- Next week?

45
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:02,544
- Yeah.
- That's not very long.

46
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:06,341
- No, it's not.
- Mnh-mnh.

47
00:06:06,344 --> 00:06:10,824
So... I could use some
suggestions on fun shit to do.

48
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:16,024
- Hmm. Fun shit to do?
- Fun shit to do.

49
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:28,581
Ow! Ow!

50
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:30,781
Jesus!

51
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:32,221
Hello.

52
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:34,264
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

53
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:40,304
Oh. Another battle scar.

54
00:06:41,344 --> 00:06:42,981
Kind of.

55
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:44,861
Let me guess, you were, like,

56
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:48,664
totally shark
fishing in Cape Town, dude.

57
00:06:49,504 --> 00:06:51,741
Is that your
best American accent?

58
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,981
- Yes.
- That's pretty good. No, um...

59
00:06:54,984 --> 00:07:00,104
It was courtesy of Josh Peters,
high school dick.

60
00:07:00,944 --> 00:07:03,621
He and I got into a fight in shop class.

61
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,981
And he hit me with this,
like, metal rod thing.

62
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:08,581
What an arsehole.

63
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:10,341
What an arsehole.

64
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:12,501
- That's terrible.
- I'm sorry.

65
00:07:12,504 --> 00:07:14,584
Is that you or me?

66
00:07:17,624 --> 00:07:19,261
Oh, it's gotta be you.

67
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:21,704
"Mom." You're so American.

68
00:07:22,464 --> 00:07:23,781
Yes, I am.

69
00:07:23,784 --> 00:07:25,664
Are you not gonna get that?

70
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:30,021
Okay, that was a little impersonal.

71
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:32,661
What, you wanna talk to her now?

72
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:35,061
- You wanna talk to my mum? I'll call back.
- Fair point.

73
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:38,024
I don't think so.

74
00:07:43,824 --> 00:07:45,184
You hungry?

75
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:54,381
Wow, look at all these games.
You're, like, a gamer. Cool.

76
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:57,101
Of course I am. For my job.

77
00:07:57,104 --> 00:07:59,821
What, a girl never beat you
at <i>Street Fighter</i>?

78
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:04,021
Is this... Like, this is, like,
your dating manual?

79
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:07,141
What?<i> The Singularity?</i>

80
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:11,341
It's when computers learn to outsmart
man like women did years ago.

81
00:08:11,344 --> 00:08:13,901
Oh! Wow!

82
00:08:13,904 --> 00:08:17,701
See, what I was doing, it was like a joke.

83
00:08:17,704 --> 00:08:18,821
- You know?
- Really?

84
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:21,341
- Yeah.
- Well, that's what you call a joke?

85
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:23,381
Mm-hmm. Yeah, you guys have those.

86
00:08:23,384 --> 00:08:26,221
- You guys have those here, right?
- Yeah, yeah. We do at the moment.

87
00:08:26,224 --> 00:08:27,464
Ow!

88
00:08:29,064 --> 00:08:31,824
That was a good joke. That was a good joke.

89
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:38,104
Enjoy your Marmite.

90
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:42,821
Whoa! Oh, my...

91
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:45,341
Do you guys seriously eat this shit?

92
00:08:45,344 --> 00:08:48,021
Okay, alright.

93
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:50,381
Alright, saved by mum.

94
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:53,621
The best way to actually just
stop her from calling is...

95
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:55,621
I don't know, answer it.

96
00:08:55,624 --> 00:09:00,141
Yeah, it's kind of like a can of worms
I just don't wanna open right now, so...

97
00:09:00,144 --> 00:09:04,101
She's worried. You're her son.
You've been travelling,

98
00:09:04,104 --> 00:09:06,981
and I just think if you
speak to her, then...

99
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:11,421
Yeah, well, I still live at
home with her back in Syracuse.

100
00:09:11,424 --> 00:09:14,184
- That's cool. That's fine.
- Yeah.

101
00:09:17,504 --> 00:09:19,024
I was taking care of my dad.

102
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:21,544
Oh, shit. Is he...?

103
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:23,861
- ...okay?
- No, he died.

104
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:26,061
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
- Last year. No, it's okay.

105
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:29,944
It was coming for a while.
It was early onset Alzheimer's.

106
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:34,261
Oh, that must have been really...
uh... tough.

107
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:36,704
Yeah, he was my best friend.

108
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:44,944
Sometimes he'd just look at me
and wouldn't even know who I was.

109
00:09:48,624 --> 00:09:52,861
Well, my mum, like, I don't even...
I don't know how to talk to her.

110
00:09:52,864 --> 00:09:56,504
You know, I don't have that connection.
I don't even know where to start.

111
00:09:58,144 --> 00:10:03,864
So that's why I left.
That's why I went on this trip.

112
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:12,301
Just to get away and make, you know,
all the memories that I can...

113
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:13,664
while I can.

114
00:10:15,184 --> 00:10:19,704
And I know I gotta talk to her
and I gotta just...

115
00:10:20,464 --> 00:10:24,821
But not on this. You know,
I just... I'll deal with it.

116
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:28,264
I'll deal with it when I get
back, you know. I'll just...

117
00:10:33,704 --> 00:10:36,344
You're a good guy, Cooper.

118
00:10:40,584 --> 00:10:42,104
Call your mum.

119
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:25,181
Zero, zero, one, nine,
three, nine, two, nine.

120
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:29,021
No, I did not buy a pair of
sandals in Koh Samui last night

121
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:30,981
because I'm in...

122
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:33,064
And how long does that take?

123
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:38,861
Because I need to buy a
ticket back to America.

124
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,104
Oh, my God.

125
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:48,424
Mm-hmm.

126
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:26,581
Can I just say, this is the most blatant
cover story for a second hook-up ever?

127
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:31,341
Yes! Yes! Oh, my God.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

128
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:33,621
Alright. Don't forget your bag.

129
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:37,941
The bag, yep, my bag.
Alright. You are a top bird.

130
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:41,224
I don't know what that means, but I heard
somebody say it once, and you're it.

131
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,741
I got a plan.

132
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:47,464
Yeah. It's odd jobs.

133
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:50,541
- For who?
- For, like, it's an app.

134
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:55,501
You can kind of... like, I've used it
all over when funds were low, so...

135
00:12:55,504 --> 00:12:57,501
- Oh, there's some interesting ones.
- Pretty cool.

136
00:12:57,504 --> 00:13:01,181
- "Thrillseekers wanted."
- Ooh.

137
00:13:01,184 --> 00:13:04,704
- This looks right up your street.
- Okay.

138
00:13:05,424 --> 00:13:09,224
Okay, four pound signs.
That's a biggie. That's good.

139
00:13:10,384 --> 00:13:11,901
It's a little out of town.

140
00:13:11,904 --> 00:13:17,661
And some kind of play test deal
for a company called Saitoo...

141
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,701
Saitogoo...

142
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:22,341
- SaitoGemu?
- SaitoGemu. Yeah.

143
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,344
They're huge.

144
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,941
- They're really big.
- Really?

145
00:13:26,944 --> 00:13:28,624
- Horror games?
- Uh...

146
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:33,461
Have you heard of...
Oh, what's one of theirs?

147
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:35,541
<i>- Harlech Shadow.</i>
- <i>Harlech Shadow?</i> Yes, I have.

148
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:38,021
I used to play that in my
buddy David Ludwig's basement

149
00:13:38,024 --> 00:13:39,781
when we were, like, seventh grade.

150
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:42,461
Well, that's Shou Saito.
It's his company.

151
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:45,141
- He's like this genius, super secretive.
- Okay.

152
00:13:45,144 --> 00:13:47,381
And apparently, they're
working on this new project.

153
00:13:47,384 --> 00:13:51,261
Big money involved. Groundbreaking.
But nobody knows anything about it.

154
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:57,221
Well, maybe if I play my cards right
I can get you an exclusive with Shou.

155
00:13:57,224 --> 00:14:00,261
Hmm? Fo Shou? Yeah?

156
00:14:02,464 --> 00:14:03,864
You should take a photo.

157
00:14:05,064 --> 00:14:09,181
Seriously, if you get a photo of
anything that they're working on,

158
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:12,224
that's a fuckload more
money than four pound signs.

159
00:14:13,824 --> 00:14:15,104
Cool.

160
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:19,664
Well, where is this place?

161
00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:13,624
Mr. Copper.

162
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:17,621
Oh, hi. Um... Just Cooper.

163
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:19,701
Mr. Cooper, I apologize.

164
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:22,061
Just Cooper is fine.

165
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:25,144
Then, in that case, I'm just Katie.

166
00:15:25,984 --> 00:15:27,901
- Hi.
- Hi.

167
00:15:27,904 --> 00:15:29,461
- Follow me.
- Oh, yeah.

168
00:15:29,464 --> 00:15:31,581
- I'll just get my pack here.
- Rav will take care of that.

169
00:15:31,584 --> 00:15:35,261
Oh, Rav will take care
of that. Okay, great.

170
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:37,341
That's good. I don't
wanna carry it anyway.

171
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:40,941
Rav kind of reminds me of
like an end-of-level boss.

172
00:15:40,944 --> 00:15:44,184
You know, <i>haiukon.</i> Just...

173
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:51,624
- How was your journey?
- Great. Thanks.

174
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:54,904
- The car pick you up okay?
- Yeah.

175
00:15:58,184 --> 00:15:59,104
Wow.

176
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:07,784
This way.

177
00:16:11,224 --> 00:16:16,744
Are they... seeing? It's cool. Very cool.

178
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:21,184
Wow.

179
00:16:25,104 --> 00:16:26,144
Come on.

180
00:16:35,024 --> 00:16:39,624
Feel like I'm gonna go meet Dumbledore.
Hope I get Gryffindor.

181
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:48,464
I'm gonna need your phone and anything
else you might use to send and receive.

182
00:16:49,944 --> 00:16:52,664
- A little paranoid, don't you think?
- Can't be too careful.

183
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:55,424
Okay, there you go.

184
00:16:59,664 --> 00:17:03,984
Wow, you really are
paranoid. Whoa!

185
00:17:05,144 --> 00:17:06,741
It's white.

186
00:17:06,744 --> 00:17:08,381
Um...

187
00:17:08,384 --> 00:17:13,741
Okay, so I'm guessing this says, like,
I agree to have my kidneys harvested?

188
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:16,421
Actually, it's a pretty
standard NDA-disclaimer thing.

189
00:17:16,424 --> 00:17:17,701
Okay.

190
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:21,024
It's important that you realize there
is a small medical procedure involved.

191
00:17:22,904 --> 00:17:24,141
Sorry, for a game?

192
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,741
Nothing permanent and we
don't harvest your kidneys,

193
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:28,221
- I promise.
- Okay.

194
00:17:28,224 --> 00:17:30,261
It's no more invasive than
having your ears pierced.

195
00:17:30,264 --> 00:17:32,897
"Confidential information,
brain downloads

196
00:17:32,922 --> 00:17:35,101
the game, duration, termination..."

197
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:39,061
Um... The signature page...

198
00:17:39,064 --> 00:17:40,821
- Where do I sign?
- Oh.

199
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:43,541
- Signature. Yeah.
- There's a page missing.

200
00:17:43,544 --> 00:17:45,541
- Okay.
- Just a moment.

201
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:50,141
Alright. I'll just wait... here.

202
00:18:00,184 --> 00:18:01,461
What the fuck?

203
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:12,661
- All good?
- All good.

204
00:18:12,664 --> 00:18:17,624
What we're working on is an
interactive augmented reality system.

205
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:22,141
- Like VR?
- More like layers on top of reality.

206
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:23,344
Oh.

207
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,901
Okay. Um...

208
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:28,464
Ow.

209
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:32,421
Um...

210
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:36,344
- What's that?
- We call this a mushroom.

211
00:18:39,224 --> 00:18:42,741
- Like <i>Mario Brothers</i>?
- If you like.

212
00:18:42,744 --> 00:18:47,701
- You're qualified to do this, right?
- I haven't killed anyone yet.

213
00:18:47,704 --> 00:18:48,944
May I?

214
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:51,584
Yeah.

215
00:18:55,744 --> 00:18:56,824
All done.

216
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:01,544
- That was it?
- See, I told you I'm good.

217
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,464
- No, don't worry, it's not permanent.
- Um...

218
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:17,221
Okay. What is this, like, some kind
of memory test or something like that?

219
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:19,821
- You'll find out.
- Oh, okay.

220
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:23,184
You might feel a slight
twinge as it initializes.

221
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:26,424
Oh, okay.

222
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:30,104
Commencing at 5:38.

223
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,304
- You ready?
- Yes, sir!

224
00:19:48,024 --> 00:19:50,141
Nearly there.

225
00:19:52,944 --> 00:19:54,384
I thought I turned that off.

226
00:20:01,744 --> 00:20:05,141
- All done. You feel okay?
- Uh-huh.

227
00:20:05,144 --> 00:20:06,264
Feel great.

228
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:10,504
- Watch the targets.
- Okay.

229
00:20:19,024 --> 00:20:21,224
Um...

230
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,941
Is...

231
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:29,944
What do you see?

232
00:20:30,984 --> 00:20:33,341
Like a... um...

233
00:20:33,344 --> 00:20:35,624
Like a video game gopher.

234
00:20:36,624 --> 00:20:39,221
- Is it more detailed now?
- Yeah.

235
00:20:39,224 --> 00:20:41,064
Yep, yeah.

236
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:44,901
- And now?
- Holy fuck!

237
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:47,781
Holy shit! He... Fuck. He's right...

238
00:20:47,784 --> 00:20:50,341
He's right... He's right... Can I...

239
00:20:50,344 --> 00:20:51,901
Whoo!

240
00:20:51,904 --> 00:20:54,101
<i>He's not real. He's a
sort of mental projection.</i>

241
00:20:54,104 --> 00:20:57,384
<i>- You can see him. I can't.
- You can't?</i>

242
00:20:59,664 --> 00:21:03,901
Wow! Oh, okay.

243
00:21:03,904 --> 00:21:05,741
Give him a whack.

244
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:09,781
Give him a whack? Oh. Okay, alright.

245
00:21:16,744 --> 00:21:19,461
Okay! Alright, so just like whack-a-mole.

246
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:21,464
- Mm-hmm.
- I've played it a million times. Okay.

247
00:21:22,504 --> 00:21:24,301
Alright.

248
00:21:24,304 --> 00:21:27,101
Here we go. Come on up.

249
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:30,941
Oh! Where you coming up?

250
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,341
No. No.

251
00:21:34,344 --> 00:21:35,781
No.

252
00:21:39,824 --> 00:21:41,021
Oh!

253
00:21:44,184 --> 00:21:45,261
Oh!

254
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:47,464
Alright. Stay down.

255
00:21:48,064 --> 00:21:51,101
Oh! Okay.

256
00:21:51,104 --> 00:21:55,461
Good game. Very good game.
You are so adorable.

257
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:58,381
Okay, bye. Bye.

258
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,341
- Is that it?
- Afraid so.

259
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:01,501
Oh.

260
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:03,701
Now, were the gophers
two-dimensional or three?

261
00:22:03,704 --> 00:22:08,304
Three. No, no, no.
3D, super 3D. Like... Yeah.

262
00:22:09,424 --> 00:22:12,781
- Now this is just a limited test demo.
- That was a demo?

263
00:22:12,784 --> 00:22:15,901
I think you should beta test the
full experience we're working on.

264
00:22:15,904 --> 00:22:18,741
There'd be more money in it,
of course. If you're game?

265
00:22:18,744 --> 00:22:22,184
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh-huh, I'm game. I'm game.

266
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:28,904
- This is Shou Saito.
- Oh!

267
00:22:29,984 --> 00:22:33,021
- You must be our latest volunteer.
- Hi.

268
00:22:33,024 --> 00:22:35,301
This is really great. Hi.

269
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:37,861
Hi.

270
00:22:37,864 --> 00:22:43,424
I just... I wanted to say that
the mole game, super fun.

271
00:22:44,384 --> 00:22:46,181
Super fun... fun.

272
00:22:48,424 --> 00:22:49,461
- Fun?
- Fun.

273
00:22:49,464 --> 00:22:52,181
- Fun is good.
- Yeah. Oh.

274
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:54,141
- Playing games is good.
- Mm.

275
00:22:54,144 --> 00:22:56,941
Your heart goes faster.

276
00:22:56,944 --> 00:22:58,141
- You smile.
- Yeah.

277
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00,581
Yeah. Or, um... scream.

278
00:23:00,584 --> 00:23:03,264
Oh!

279
00:23:05,024 --> 00:23:08,501
I have always liked to
make the player jump.

280
00:23:08,504 --> 00:23:11,301
Frightened. You get scared, you jump.

281
00:23:11,304 --> 00:23:13,501
- Afterwards, you feel good.
- Yeah.

282
00:23:13,504 --> 00:23:14,624
You glow.

283
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:17,544
Why?

284
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,224
Oh, um...

285
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:24,741
Because of the adrenaline rush.

286
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:25,901
- Yes.
- Yeah.

287
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:30,144
But mostly because you are still alive.

288
00:23:31,104 --> 00:23:34,941
You have faced your greatest
fears in a safe environment.

289
00:23:34,944 --> 00:23:39,221
It is a release of fear.
It liberates you.

290
00:23:39,224 --> 00:23:42,224
Yeah. I mean, totally.

291
00:23:43,544 --> 00:23:45,021
What we are working on now

292
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:48,701
is the most personal survival
horror game in history.

293
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:51,301
Cool.

294
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,861
One that works out how to scare
you by using your own mind.

295
00:23:54,864 --> 00:23:59,301
Whoa. That... That sounds crazy.

296
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,261
Can't wait!

297
00:24:01,264 --> 00:24:04,141
I'm uploading a neural net package.

298
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:06,941
Neural net packing, neural net. Hmm.

299
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:08,984
Name could use a little work, I think.
It's all 90s.

300
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:11,261
I'm just kidding, it's a good name.

301
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,261
It's state of the art
intelligence software.

302
00:24:14,264 --> 00:24:18,381
It learns and adapts on the fly.
It'll monitor your brain activity

303
00:24:18,384 --> 00:24:20,421
and try and work out
how best to frighten you

304
00:24:20,424 --> 00:24:22,901
and then adjust to your
experience accordingly.

305
00:24:22,904 --> 00:24:23,781
Whoa!

306
00:24:23,784 --> 00:24:25,381
- Are you ready?
- Oh, yeah.

307
00:24:25,384 --> 00:24:28,544
- Beam me up. Here we go, lock and load.
- Eyes closed.

308
00:24:29,824 --> 00:24:33,024
- Time is currently 6:17 p.m.
- Okay.

309
00:24:33,784 --> 00:24:40,104
It's uploading. Five, four,
three, two, one.

310
00:24:55,144 --> 00:24:56,664
How are you feeling?

311
00:24:59,824 --> 00:25:01,224
Um...

312
00:25:03,384 --> 00:25:05,581
I feel good. I feel normal.

313
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:08,104
Okay. Stand up, slowly.

314
00:25:18,304 --> 00:25:19,624
Are you ready to play?

315
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:35,821
Isn't this the
<i>Harlech Shadow</i> house?

316
00:25:35,824 --> 00:25:37,261
It's part of the estate.

317
00:25:37,264 --> 00:25:40,861
The gamekeeper's lodge, actually.
But, yeah, this was the model.

318
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:44,384
The layout was replicated for
the game and the texture scanned.

319
00:25:45,264 --> 00:25:47,221
Wow!

320
00:25:47,224 --> 00:25:49,224
Very, very cool.

321
00:25:58,344 --> 00:26:00,901
So what's the game, what do I do?

322
00:26:00,904 --> 00:26:03,981
You don't have to do anything.

323
00:26:03,984 --> 00:26:06,581
You just stay in here alone,

324
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:09,341
see how long you last until
you're too scared to continue.

325
00:26:09,344 --> 00:26:11,624
So all I have to do is,
like, stay here?

326
00:26:12,184 --> 00:26:13,981
And I get paid for that?

327
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:16,701
I'll be back in the control room, watching.

328
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:21,261
There are cameras all over,
so no stealing the silverware.

329
00:26:21,264 --> 00:26:23,864
And now there's this.

330
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:29,101
- And what's this?
- It's an earpiece.

331
00:26:29,104 --> 00:26:30,341
Oh!

332
00:26:30,344 --> 00:26:33,101
Yeah, just pop it in, and you and I
will be in contact the whole time.

333
00:26:33,104 --> 00:26:34,461
Oh, cool.

334
00:26:34,464 --> 00:26:38,581
And I can, like, talk to you,
and you'll hear it? Great, that's great.

335
00:26:38,584 --> 00:26:40,821
Now, nothing you'll see
can physically harm you.

336
00:26:40,824 --> 00:26:43,341
It's all just audio-visual,
like the gopher game.

337
00:26:43,344 --> 00:26:44,421
Oh, okay.

338
00:26:44,424 --> 00:26:47,581
But if it does get too intense,
we can pull you out at any time

339
00:26:47,584 --> 00:26:49,821
- and stop the experiment.
- Okay.

340
00:26:49,824 --> 00:26:51,661
Is there a safe word you can think of?

341
00:26:51,664 --> 00:26:54,101
Something easy to remember in distress?

342
00:26:54,104 --> 00:26:56,304
How about the word "stop"?

343
00:26:57,224 --> 00:27:00,621
- Good choice. "Stop" it is.
- Yeah.

344
00:27:00,624 --> 00:27:02,621
Okay, we'll leave you
to enjoy your evening.

345
00:27:02,624 --> 00:27:04,901
- Alright.
- You'll hear from me in a moment.

346
00:27:04,904 --> 00:27:06,461
Just make yourself at home.

347
00:27:06,464 --> 00:27:10,464
Okay, all right.
Well, take her easy.

348
00:27:28,944 --> 00:27:32,224
<i>Harlech... Shadow.</i>

349
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:57,184
Is this real? Yeah, it's real.
That's real. It's really dead.

350
00:28:02,024 --> 00:28:04,221
- <i>Cooper.</i>
- Oh, hey.

351
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,944
<i>- Are you hearing me?</i>
- Loud and clear.

352
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,221
Oh!

353
00:28:08,224 --> 00:28:10,904
<i>Reaching for the Dutch
courage already, I see.</i>

354
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:19,301
<i>- I'm afraid that wine's non-alcoholic.</i>
- Lame.

355
00:28:19,304 --> 00:28:24,344
<i>- Well, we need you with a clear head.</i>
- Okay. Fair point. Fair point.

356
00:28:26,864 --> 00:28:29,464
This is high-quality craftsmanship.
This is nice.

357
00:28:30,464 --> 00:28:32,944
Yeah. It's good woodwork.

358
00:28:39,744 --> 00:28:43,184
- That's this place.
<i>- Full marks for observation.</i>

359
00:28:44,104 --> 00:28:45,944
Mm-hmm! Yep!

360
00:29:25,384 --> 00:29:28,384
Alright, there we go.

361
00:29:33,544 --> 00:29:34,984
Ah!

362
00:29:38,704 --> 00:29:40,901
- Oh, shit.
<i>- What's up?</i>

363
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,501
I just forgot I don't have my phone.

364
00:29:42,504 --> 00:29:45,304
I keep going for it,
I forget it's not in my pocket.

365
00:29:47,464 --> 00:29:51,541
And there's, uh... no TV here, so...

366
00:29:51,544 --> 00:29:56,661
<i>Welcome to the 19th century.
No TV, no Internet, no wi-fi.</i>

367
00:29:56,664 --> 00:30:00,221
Yeah. No wonder people were seeing shit.

368
00:30:00,224 --> 00:30:02,421
Probably were just bored
out of their gourds.

369
00:30:02,424 --> 00:30:04,981
<i>Well, that's the leading
theory about ghost sightings.</i>

370
00:30:04,984 --> 00:30:07,181
<i>The mind plays tricks
when less stimulated.</i>

371
00:30:07,184 --> 00:30:09,461
<i>Fewer distractions,
people saw more ghosts.</i>

372
00:30:09,464 --> 00:30:12,141
Isn't that a nice piece of info?

373
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:15,984
Well, they got literature, though.

374
00:30:17,544 --> 00:30:19,024
That's pretty sweet, right?

375
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:25,701
Oh, my God, I can't remember the
actual last time that I read a book.

376
00:30:25,704 --> 00:30:28,261
<i>To think people used
to do this on purpose.</i>

377
00:30:28,264 --> 00:30:31,141
I know. Crazy. Why?

378
00:30:31,144 --> 00:30:34,061
<i>- You know, I don't think I've...</i>
- Shh, alright?

379
00:30:34,064 --> 00:30:37,141
I need to get into some old-school
shit here. Concentrate.

380
00:30:37,144 --> 00:30:39,704
<i>Pardon me.</i>

381
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,941
<i>Can I point out your heart
rate just increased?</i>

382
00:30:49,944 --> 00:30:54,581
Yeah. Well, it should have cos
there's a huge crazy spider.

383
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:56,141
<i>You see a spider?</i>

384
00:30:56,144 --> 00:30:58,824
<i>- You don't... you don't see that?</i>
- No.

385
00:30:59,784 --> 00:31:03,584
Don't... Don't walk. Don't...

386
00:31:11,224 --> 00:31:13,301
Holy shit!

387
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,621
<i>Tough guy like you, scared of spiders.</i>

388
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,141
Yeah, I'm just not fond of them.

389
00:31:17,144 --> 00:31:19,621
<i>It's worked out you're
an arachnophobe quickly.</i>

390
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:21,664
<i>It's probing for weak spots.</i>

391
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:23,664
God damn it.

392
00:31:25,744 --> 00:31:26,824
Fucker!

393
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:32,144
Yeah!

394
00:31:35,704 --> 00:31:36,864
Um...

395
00:31:37,584 --> 00:31:38,981
Okay.

396
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:40,781
Yeah, well, yeah.

397
00:31:40,784 --> 00:31:44,384
Whole lot more realistic
than the gopher game.

398
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:47,024
It's good. It's good graphics.

399
00:31:48,064 --> 00:31:51,024
It's good, uh... Yeah.

400
00:31:55,024 --> 00:31:57,584
Weak sauce.

401
00:32:19,864 --> 00:32:22,581
<i>- What is it?</i>
- Just...

402
00:32:22,584 --> 00:32:24,304
Nothing. Nothing.

403
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:29,184
Here with the figures.
There's a... No. There's a light on...

404
00:32:29,744 --> 00:32:31,341
now, in the...

405
00:32:31,344 --> 00:32:35,901
Can you... zoom in and... Zoom in on it?

406
00:32:35,904 --> 00:32:38,301
And you can see what
I'm talking about. Whoa!

407
00:32:38,304 --> 00:32:40,261
- <i>Cooper...</i>
- And now there's... Shh!

408
00:32:40,264 --> 00:32:45,624
There's a guy in the window.
That wasn't...

409
00:32:47,584 --> 00:32:50,464
Yeah.

410
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,104
And now he's gone.
Now nobody's in the window.

411
00:32:56,584 --> 00:33:00,304
Which is the...

412
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:05,021
Mm-hmm.

413
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,861
Yeah, there's a...

414
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:12,144
Just leaky pipes.

415
00:33:21,704 --> 00:33:26,119
I knew it. It was leaky pipes, like...

416
00:33:26,144 --> 00:33:29,101
Holy fuck!

417
00:33:31,504 --> 00:33:33,181
Fuck!

418
00:33:35,424 --> 00:33:38,381
Oh! Oh!

419
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:41,184
Okay.

420
00:33:41,864 --> 00:33:44,024
That got me. You got me.

421
00:33:44,984 --> 00:33:46,421
<i>What are you seeing?</i>

422
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:50,021
Like a creepy fucking guy.

423
00:33:50,024 --> 00:33:51,904
Wow, just...

424
00:33:55,064 --> 00:33:57,864
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

425
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:02,061
He kinda looks like Josh Peters.

426
00:34:02,064 --> 00:34:04,421
- It's Josh Peters! You're Josh Peters!
<i>- Sorry?</i>

427
00:34:04,424 --> 00:34:07,981
You're Josh Peters from high school!
From a guy I know at high school.

428
00:34:07,984 --> 00:34:11,421
<i>The system could be mining some of
your personal memories for texture.</i>

429
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,981
<i>Was Josh Peters someone
you were scared of?</i>

430
00:34:13,984 --> 00:34:15,621
He was a bully. I wasn't scared.

431
00:34:15,624 --> 00:34:17,664
I wasn't scared of him,
but he was a bully and...

432
00:34:18,744 --> 00:34:24,181
Man! Take a couple of Krav
Maga classes and I'd be ready.

433
00:34:24,184 --> 00:34:27,181
I'd be ready!

434
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:36,464
<i>Kali ma!</i> Dah!

435
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:39,504
I'm gonna get some wine. Re-up.

436
00:34:40,464 --> 00:34:44,144
I'd offer you some, but I don't
think you can drink it so...

437
00:34:44,824 --> 00:34:46,904
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

438
00:34:48,064 --> 00:34:49,944
Catch ya later, Peters.

439
00:34:52,904 --> 00:34:55,341
This non-alcoholic wine is pretty good.

440
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:59,264
I'm not like a expert or anything,
but it's kinda great.

441
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:05,461
I was in France.
I stayed at this, like, vineyard,

442
00:35:05,464 --> 00:35:10,061
and they had this wine, like,
grape-stomping festival.

443
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:12,821
Now that, that wine was good. I know that.

444
00:35:12,824 --> 00:35:14,821
<i>You're being discursive.</i>

445
00:35:14,824 --> 00:35:17,941
- What is discursive? Discursive?
<i>- Talkative.</i>

446
00:35:17,944 --> 00:35:20,501
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- Rambling.</i>

447
00:35:20,504 --> 00:35:22,941
Is that a problem?

448
00:35:22,944 --> 00:35:25,701
<i>People sometimes talk
more when they're afraid.</i>

449
00:35:25,704 --> 00:35:27,981
<i>Helps compensate for the fear.</i>

450
00:35:27,984 --> 00:35:29,621
<i>- Masks it, too.</i>
- Oh, yeah?

451
00:35:29,624 --> 00:35:32,701
<i>Similar to when you've got
the TV on late at night.</i>

452
00:35:32,704 --> 00:35:34,864
<i>The voices make you feel less alone.</i>

453
00:35:37,104 --> 00:35:39,741
<i>Even though you are alone.</i>

454
00:35:39,744 --> 00:35:43,944
You aren't scaring me, Katie.

455
00:35:44,384 --> 00:35:46,101
<i>Pity.</i>

456
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:48,981
Is there like a refrigerator here?

457
00:35:48,984 --> 00:35:51,661
<i>There's some snacks in the cupboard.</i>

458
00:35:51,664 --> 00:35:55,704
Alrighty. Eenie meenie, miney...

459
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:58,544
Mo! Alright.

460
00:35:59,384 --> 00:36:01,104
Okay, ginger snaps.

461
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:03,264
Let's see.

462
00:36:04,344 --> 00:36:06,824
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This'll do.

463
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:10,664
Now... um...

464
00:36:12,864 --> 00:36:16,581
He's gonna be right behind this door
when I close it, isn't he?

465
00:36:16,584 --> 00:36:18,904
Yeah, that's how this works.

466
00:36:22,664 --> 00:36:25,541
Knew it. Jump scares get pretty old...

467
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:30,061
Fuck!

468
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:31,664
Oh, God.

469
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,544
<i>- What the hell is that?</i>
- What do you see?

470
00:36:37,464 --> 00:36:39,304
Holy shit!

471
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:44,304
A fucking... Uh...

472
00:36:44,984 --> 00:36:46,461
Hard to explain.

473
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:51,261
It's like a huge-ass spider with a
face and dicks coming out of his mouth.

474
00:36:51,264 --> 00:36:52,701
It's...

475
00:36:52,704 --> 00:36:55,701
Peters. Peters is inside.

476
00:36:55,704 --> 00:37:01,304
Like a Peters-spider mash-up.

477
00:37:02,024 --> 00:37:05,861
Ah, Katie! Are you doing
this, or is this fucking me?

478
00:37:05,864 --> 00:37:10,421
<i>- I think that's all you.</i>
- I'm so fucked up!

479
00:37:10,424 --> 00:37:12,664
<i>God! Fuck!</i>

480
00:37:14,264 --> 00:37:17,301
Holy shit, you're fucking gross.

481
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:20,541
Yeah...

482
00:37:20,544 --> 00:37:22,144
Sorry, can you say again?

483
00:37:23,864 --> 00:37:25,664
Katie, hello?

484
00:37:27,304 --> 00:37:28,584
Damn it, Katie!

485
00:37:33,024 --> 00:37:36,664
Whenever you come back online,
just say the word.

486
00:37:37,864 --> 00:37:40,941
No, I'm not scared, just... bored.

487
00:37:45,104 --> 00:37:46,584
That you guys?

488
00:37:52,464 --> 00:37:55,181
Coming to fix the earpiece?
That's probably a good idea.

489
00:37:55,184 --> 00:37:57,664
Yeah. Yeah.

490
00:38:09,904 --> 00:38:13,424
Fuck it, man!

491
00:38:19,784 --> 00:38:21,024
Come on!

492
00:38:22,704 --> 00:38:23,984
You're in danger.

493
00:38:25,384 --> 00:38:27,061
Sonja?

494
00:38:29,584 --> 00:38:32,021
Now we're talking.
Alright, this is incredible.

495
00:38:32,024 --> 00:38:36,341
This... very impressive.
I am thoroughly impressed.

496
00:38:36,344 --> 00:38:39,301
I am... Wow! Wow!

497
00:38:39,304 --> 00:38:43,941
You look so real.
You're, like, just like her.

498
00:38:43,944 --> 00:38:45,581
I mean, wow.

499
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:51,501
Except... you're just
unfortunately not... um...

500
00:38:51,504 --> 00:38:54,301
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

501
00:38:54,304 --> 00:38:57,501
- Cooper, you're in danger.
- Shh! Quiet. Quiet! I need to think.

502
00:38:57,504 --> 00:39:01,221
You're fucking real.
You are real. You're real.

503
00:39:01,224 --> 00:39:03,901
- Cooper, you're in...
- You're Sonja. You're actually here.

504
00:39:03,904 --> 00:39:06,781
- Are you actually here right now?
- I'm real. I'm actually here.

505
00:39:06,784 --> 00:39:08,221
- God.
- And we have to go.

506
00:39:08,224 --> 00:39:10,021
- You have to listen to me.
- How are you here?

507
00:39:10,024 --> 00:39:11,941
You know that photo that you sent me?

508
00:39:11,944 --> 00:39:14,381
I dug around and apparently
Shou Saito took out a patent

509
00:39:14,384 --> 00:39:17,901
for a computer brain interface last year.

510
00:39:17,904 --> 00:39:19,981
How are you real? I don't...

511
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:22,821
Okay, fuck. I don't...

512
00:39:22,824 --> 00:39:24,901
They brought you here!

513
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,541
You are, you're real,
and they brought you here,

514
00:39:27,544 --> 00:39:31,181
and they're trying to fuck with me.
Nice try, good try.

515
00:39:31,184 --> 00:39:33,741
I get it. It's part of the test.

516
00:39:33,744 --> 00:39:38,221
His patent got rejected outright. They
said it was insane, it was dangerous.

517
00:39:38,224 --> 00:39:40,223
Wow. Really? How much
are they paying you?

518
00:39:40,248 --> 00:39:42,222
Honestly. Cos you're
killing it right now.

519
00:39:42,224 --> 00:39:45,181
- Have they given you something?
- Sorry, I thought you were fake.

520
00:39:45,184 --> 00:39:47,701
But now I know you're real,
I'm being a really terrible host.

521
00:39:47,704 --> 00:39:51,104
I got some non-alcoholic wine.
Might put us in the mood.

522
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:55,781
- Cooper, what I want to do is...
- We'll talk about it in the kitchen.

523
00:39:55,784 --> 00:39:58,821
- Cooper!
- Sonja, relax, okay?

524
00:39:58,824 --> 00:40:01,941
Give it up. I know, the
jig's up, okay? Let it go.

525
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:03,221
Look, Cooper, there's more.

526
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:05,621
Five people have disappeared
in the past year.

527
00:40:05,624 --> 00:40:10,021
All tourists, all registered
with that stupid odd jobs app.

528
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:13,021
Oh, yeah? Wow. God, that's crazy.

529
00:40:13,024 --> 00:40:15,781
Whatever they're doing to you,
whatever they've done to you,

530
00:40:15,784 --> 00:40:20,021
it's dangerous, and we really
have to go now, Cooper.

531
00:40:20,024 --> 00:40:23,141
Okay, okay. Alright.

532
00:40:23,144 --> 00:40:25,981
- Well, if your story's true...
- Cooper.

533
00:40:25,984 --> 00:40:28,541
- Then how'd you find me?
- What?

534
00:40:28,544 --> 00:40:29,824
How'd you know where I am?

535
00:40:30,704 --> 00:40:32,701
It's a games company,
I looked up the address.

536
00:40:32,704 --> 00:40:34,181
Yeah, really?

537
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:37,581
No, no, no, no. How'd you
find me here? This place.

538
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:39,301
- I tracked you.
- You tracked me?

539
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:41,381
Yeah, with your GPS on your
phone. Find My Friends.

540
00:40:41,384 --> 00:40:45,141
Find My Friends? That would've
worked, but they took my phone.

541
00:40:45,144 --> 00:40:51,741
And it's in a building, like, a mile away.
So, yeah, nice try.

542
00:40:51,744 --> 00:40:54,021
That's right.

543
00:40:54,024 --> 00:40:57,264
So much for women outsmarting men.
Singularity <i>that!</i>

544
00:40:59,064 --> 00:41:00,421
Look, all I'm saying is that

545
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:02,981
I think that you could've
come up with a better story,

546
00:41:02,984 --> 00:41:06,261
it could have been funny or...

547
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:09,184
Okay, alright, don't be pissed.

548
00:41:10,024 --> 00:41:13,021
Do you ever wonder how your
bank account got hacked?

549
00:41:13,024 --> 00:41:14,941
What are you doing?

550
00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:18,264
- I cloned your card as you were asleep.
- Whoa. Okay.

551
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:20,501
Put the knife down.
What are you going to do with that?

552
00:41:20,504 --> 00:41:22,941
I drew your attention to this job.

553
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:26,101
Sonja, put the fucking knife
down, okay? It's not funny.

554
00:41:26,104 --> 00:41:28,701
Should've called your mum, Cooper.

555
00:41:28,704 --> 00:41:31,941
- But you called me, and I led you here...
- Sonja.

556
00:41:31,944 --> 00:41:33,701
- You know what?
- ...like a breadcrumb trail.

557
00:41:33,704 --> 00:41:39,221
Put the knife down. Drop the act.
Okay, seriously, drop the knife, Sonja.

558
00:41:39,224 --> 00:41:42,181
It's not fucking funny. Put the knife...

559
00:41:42,184 --> 00:41:45,861
This isn't what I signed up for.
I'm fucking done, okay?

560
00:41:45,864 --> 00:41:47,984
Fuck!

561
00:41:54,104 --> 00:41:55,944
What the fuck?

562
00:42:00,624 --> 00:42:03,701
Oh, fuck! Oh!

563
00:42:11,744 --> 00:42:12,864
Holy fuck!

564
00:42:21,584 --> 00:42:22,664
Stop!

565
00:42:39,904 --> 00:42:43,741
Fuck!

566
00:43:18,144 --> 00:43:23,064
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

567
00:43:43,944 --> 00:43:46,821
- <i>Cooper.</i>
- Katie!

568
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,221
<i>- Katie!</i>
- Cooper.

569
00:43:48,224 --> 00:43:49,541
<i>- Katie!</i>
- Cooper, what's happening?

570
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,701
What the fuck happened?

571
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:53,781
<i>What's happening? We've been talking.
You've not been responding.</i>

572
00:43:53,784 --> 00:43:57,101
- You said I wouldn't feel anything!
<i>- What are you seeing? What's there?</i>

573
00:43:57,104 --> 00:44:00,221
- Fuck! She's gone now.
<i>- Who's gone?</i>

574
00:44:00,224 --> 00:44:03,061
Oh, my God, I-I felt it.

575
00:44:03,064 --> 00:44:05,741
There's a knife in my arm!

576
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:08,741
- In my shoulder.
<i>- Cooper, who was there?</i>

577
00:44:08,744 --> 00:44:10,981
- Fuck... Sonja.
<i>- Who?</i>

578
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:15,301
Sonja. She's this girl that I know,
that fucking... She stabbed me.

579
00:44:15,304 --> 00:44:18,421
- She had a fucking knife.
<i>- Nothing can harm you, Cooper.</i>

580
00:44:18,424 --> 00:44:22,621
- No, no, no, no. She was solid.
<i>- No, she can't have been.</i>

581
00:44:22,624 --> 00:44:26,101
She... I was stabbed! I would know!

582
00:44:26,104 --> 00:44:28,661
<i>Nothing you see can
harm or even touch you.</i>

583
00:44:28,664 --> 00:44:30,421
<i>It's purely audio-visual.</i>

584
00:44:30,424 --> 00:44:33,741
<i>- There's no physical sensation.</i>
- Fuck! Yes, there was!

585
00:44:33,744 --> 00:44:39,101
<i>- Cooper, you need to calm down.</i>
- I know because I felt it, okay?

586
00:44:39,104 --> 00:44:42,301
I felt her arm, it was warm,

587
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:45,541
and I felt her fucking
stab me in the shoulder.

588
00:44:45,544 --> 00:44:48,821
<i>- That's not possible.</i>
- Oh, my God.

589
00:44:48,824 --> 00:44:52,061
<i>- It's not possible, Cooper.</i>
- Yeah, it is! Yeah, it is!

590
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,221
<i>Physical sensations
shouldn't be possible.</i>

591
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:58,101
<i>- Unless, I mean...</i>
- Oh, God. Unless what?

592
00:44:58,104 --> 00:45:01,141
<i>I don't know. The neuron net,
it could have maybe worked out</i>

593
00:45:01,144 --> 00:45:03,701
<i>some means of replicating
physical experiences,</i>

594
00:45:03,704 --> 00:45:06,901
<i>- but that would be unprecedented.</i>
- Jesus Christ.

595
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:09,061
Okay, you know what? Stop the game.

596
00:45:09,064 --> 00:45:11,541
I want out. Just pull me out now.

597
00:45:11,544 --> 00:45:14,781
Stop, stop, stop. Safe
word. Fucking stop!

598
00:45:14,784 --> 00:45:17,741
<i>- Okay, okay, just let us work it out.</i>
- Oh, God.

599
00:45:17,744 --> 00:45:19,861
No, I want this fucking thing out now.

600
00:45:19,864 --> 00:45:22,341
<i>Cooper, do not attempt
to remove that yourself.</i>

601
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,261
Removing it yourself
is extremely dangerous.

602
00:45:24,264 --> 00:45:26,141
Stop that, that could kill you!

603
00:45:26,144 --> 00:45:27,341
Just stay calm!

604
00:45:27,344 --> 00:45:29,461
Is that Shou?

605
00:45:29,464 --> 00:45:31,221
Is that Shou? What's he saying?
What's he saying?

606
00:45:31,224 --> 00:45:33,861
<i>Okay, Cooper. We're gonna
commence with deactivation.</i>

607
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:35,621
Oh, that's great news.

608
00:45:35,624 --> 00:45:39,661
<i>We need you to follow instructions
and make it to the access point.</i>

609
00:45:39,664 --> 00:45:43,904
The access point? Great.
Where the fuck's the access point?

610
00:45:46,584 --> 00:45:51,621
- Oh, fuck! More stairs? Come on!
<i>- Just one more level.</i>

611
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,744
<i>- Trust me.</i>
- Okay.

612
00:45:56,184 --> 00:45:57,624
<i>Left at the top.</i>

613
00:45:59,064 --> 00:46:01,224
- Okay, which door?
- <i>Room at the end.</i>

614
00:46:05,584 --> 00:46:06,904
<i>What is it?</i>

615
00:46:08,144 --> 00:46:11,621
There's gonna be something
behind there. I can feel it.

616
00:46:11,624 --> 00:46:13,701
- Something like...
<i>- Like what?</i>

617
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:17,221
Some personal fucked-up shit.

618
00:46:17,224 --> 00:46:20,581
Like... I don't know, I could
feel it digging around in my head.

619
00:46:20,584 --> 00:46:22,421
<i>Cooper, get to the door.</i>

620
00:46:22,424 --> 00:46:26,421
It's gonna be like my mum,
I don't know, dead.

621
00:46:26,424 --> 00:46:29,661
<i>- Your mum?</i>
- Fucking swinging from a fucking beam.

622
00:46:29,664 --> 00:46:32,384
<i>- Your mother is not in there.</i>
- You're not in control of this!

623
00:46:33,264 --> 00:46:36,261
It's in my head. It
fucking knows. It knows.

624
00:46:36,264 --> 00:46:38,541
- It knows!
<i>- It knows what?</i>

625
00:46:38,544 --> 00:46:40,701
It knows I got this thing with my mum.

626
00:46:40,704 --> 00:46:43,541
<i>Cooper, I promise you,
she's not in there.</i>

627
00:46:43,544 --> 00:46:45,821
<i>- Now open the door.</i>
- Oh, my God.

628
00:46:45,824 --> 00:46:48,981
<i>It's the only way I can
get you out. Listen to me.</i>

629
00:46:48,984 --> 00:46:52,224
Okay, Okay. Fuck. Okay.

630
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:56,141
<i>Whatever's in there cannot harm you.</i>

631
00:46:56,144 --> 00:46:59,101
<i>But I can't get you out unless
you open that door, Cooper.</i>

632
00:46:59,104 --> 00:47:00,101
Okay.

633
00:47:00,104 --> 00:47:02,021
<i>Would you kindly open the door?</i>

634
00:47:02,024 --> 00:47:04,664
Here we go. Here we go.

635
00:47:20,224 --> 00:47:22,784
Okay.

636
00:47:23,984 --> 00:47:28,981
Okay, okay, I'm in the room.
Where's the access point?

637
00:47:28,984 --> 00:47:30,904
<i>Access point?</i>

638
00:47:31,864 --> 00:47:34,981
<i>- There is no access point.</i>
- What?

639
00:47:36,224 --> 00:47:38,021
<i>I'm fucking with you, Cooper.</i>

640
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:40,701
<i>I told you to come up here to
see if we've broken you enough</i>

641
00:47:40,704 --> 00:47:43,301
<i>to obey instructions without question.</i>

642
00:47:43,304 --> 00:47:45,861
<i>- And we have.</i>
- Oh, no, no, no.

643
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:49,381
Katie, come on. Katie, come on, let me out!

644
00:47:49,384 --> 00:47:52,341
Katie, let me out, come on! What the fuck!

645
00:47:52,344 --> 00:47:55,941
Oh, what are you gonna do?
Oh, what are you doing to me?

646
00:47:55,944 --> 00:47:59,621
- Why are you doing this?
<i>- You thought you'd see your mother.</i>

647
00:47:59,624 --> 00:48:02,861
- Oh, fuck!
<i>- What does she look like?</i>

648
00:48:04,544 --> 00:48:06,904
<i>Your mother, can you describe her face?</i>

649
00:48:08,424 --> 00:48:09,784
<i>Her hair colour?</i>

650
00:48:10,464 --> 00:48:11,341
She...

651
00:48:11,344 --> 00:48:13,464
<i>Is she tall, short, fat, thin?</i>

652
00:48:15,544 --> 00:48:17,501
<i>- Where did you grow up?</i>
- She...

653
00:48:17,504 --> 00:48:21,181
<i>What's your favourite band?
Your favourite flavour ice cream?</i>

654
00:48:21,184 --> 00:48:23,501
<i>The name of the girl who stabbed you?</i>

655
00:48:23,504 --> 00:48:26,141
<i>You don't know any of
these things, do you?</i>

656
00:48:26,144 --> 00:48:27,661
<i>Don't you think that's odd?</i>

657
00:48:27,664 --> 00:48:29,981
It's fucking taking my memories!

658
00:48:29,984 --> 00:48:32,421
<i>Overwriting them, technically.</i>

659
00:48:32,424 --> 00:48:34,341
Fuck.

660
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:36,184
<i>Look in the mirror behind you.</i>

661
00:48:39,944 --> 00:48:41,744
<i>Do you recognize yourself?</i>

662
00:48:43,744 --> 00:48:46,024
<i>Do you even know who you're looking at?</i>

663
00:48:48,664 --> 00:48:53,101
<i>Soon you won't be anything.
You'll be just like your dad.</i>

664
00:48:53,104 --> 00:48:54,941
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

665
00:48:54,944 --> 00:48:56,621
<i>- That's what really scares you, isn't it?</i>
- Stop it.

666
00:48:56,624 --> 00:48:59,421
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
<i>- You're going the same place he did.</i>

667
00:48:59,424 --> 00:49:01,141
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

668
00:49:01,144 --> 00:49:04,061
<i>- You're going nowhere.</i>
- Shut up! Shut up.

669
00:49:04,064 --> 00:49:08,501
<i> You should have
called mum. She's all that's left.</i>

670
00:49:08,504 --> 00:49:11,541
<i>- You abandoned her.</i>
- No, no, no, no!

671
00:49:11,544 --> 00:49:13,501
Get out of my head!

672
00:49:13,504 --> 00:49:16,061
<i>You'll never see her again.
You'll never speak to her again.</i>

673
00:49:16,064 --> 00:49:18,821
<i>- Never see her face.</i>
- Get out of my fucking head!

674
00:49:18,824 --> 00:49:23,381
Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!

675
00:49:23,384 --> 00:49:27,781
<i>You're a bad son. You'll never
see your mother again.</i>

676
00:49:27,784 --> 00:49:29,901
<i>You're going nowhere.</i>

677
00:49:29,904 --> 00:49:32,144
<i>Straight into oblivion.</i>

678
00:49:33,184 --> 00:49:35,621
<i>You deserve it.
You should have called her.</i>

679
00:49:35,624 --> 00:49:37,741
Get out of my fucking head!

680
00:49:40,064 --> 00:49:43,501
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!

681
00:49:43,504 --> 00:49:44,981
Get it out of my fucking head!

682
00:49:44,984 --> 00:49:47,661
Cooper, I'm gonna shut it off, okay?
I just need to connect.

683
00:49:47,664 --> 00:49:48,984
Get it out of my head!

684
00:49:49,744 --> 00:49:52,744
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!

685
00:49:53,584 --> 00:49:57,421
Oh, my God. Where am I?

686
00:50:01,584 --> 00:50:04,181
Who are you?

687
00:50:04,184 --> 00:50:06,901
I can't stop it.

688
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:14,781
I don't know who I am.
So I... So I need to go home.

689
00:50:14,784 --> 00:50:17,664
The interface has data tendrils like roots.

690
00:50:18,864 --> 00:50:21,421
They've dug in deeper
than they're meant to.

691
00:50:21,424 --> 00:50:25,464
Threaded through your brain,
taken over whole areas, I can't stop it.

692
00:50:26,744 --> 00:50:28,584
I can't remove it, and I can't stop it.

693
00:50:29,624 --> 00:50:33,224
But I...
But I don't know who I am.

694
00:50:35,064 --> 00:50:38,544
I don't know... I don't know who I am.

695
00:50:41,984 --> 00:50:44,341
I don't know who I am.

696
00:50:44,344 --> 00:50:45,621
I don't know.

697
00:50:45,624 --> 00:50:50,424
On behalf of Saito Game Team,
I most humbly apologize.

698
00:50:52,824 --> 00:50:57,784
Who are you?
What have you done to me?

699
00:50:58,864 --> 00:51:02,224
- What have you done to me?
- Put him with the others, please.

700
00:51:03,344 --> 00:51:05,661
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

701
00:51:05,664 --> 00:51:07,981
Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop, stop, stop!

702
00:51:07,984 --> 00:51:11,381
Stop, stop, stop, stop! No, don't, don't!

703
00:51:11,384 --> 00:51:15,501
Don't! Don't!

704
00:51:15,504 --> 00:51:17,701
Stop! Stop!

705
00:51:19,144 --> 00:51:20,544
No!

706
00:51:22,744 --> 00:51:25,904
Oh, fuck.

707
00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:28,104
That was one second.

708
00:51:29,664 --> 00:51:34,621
Either he's super susceptible to this or
the software is way too powerful still.

709
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:39,021
It's jumped from zero to
18K in five milliseconds...

710
00:51:39,024 --> 00:51:44,461
<i>I'm sorry. The experience was
more powerful than intended, Mr. Cooper.</i>

711
00:51:44,464 --> 00:51:46,504
<i>I hope you can forgive us.</i>

712
00:51:58,864 --> 00:52:00,941
<i>...all luggage under
the seat in front of you.</i>

713
00:52:00,944 --> 00:52:03,661
<i>All electronic devices should
now be turned off and stowed</i>

714
00:52:03,664 --> 00:52:07,424
<i>as they may interfere with the aircraft's
navigational and communication....</i>

715
00:52:31,264 --> 00:52:32,384
Mum?

716
00:52:55,704 --> 00:52:57,024
Mum?

717
00:53:09,784 --> 00:53:11,544
I have to call him.

718
00:53:22,504 --> 00:53:23,664
Mum?

719
00:53:25,464 --> 00:53:27,424
Why did Cooper go?

720
00:53:28,224 --> 00:53:31,664
- I...
- Mom, I'm right here. I'm...

721
00:53:34,664 --> 00:53:38,984
- I'm right here, Mum.
- I have to call Cooper.

722
00:53:41,144 --> 00:53:43,824
I have to call and
make sure that he's safe.

723
00:53:44,864 --> 00:53:48,864
I have to call him. I have to call him.
I have to call him.

724
00:53:57,384 --> 00:53:58,824
Mum?

725
00:54:02,424 --> 00:54:04,821
Mum!

726
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:08,301
Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum!
