You're good at this.

26
00:03:10,303 --> 00:03:12,423
It's, uh... got different endings.

Uh-huh?

29
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,383
- It was kinda the first game to do that.
- Damn it!

Oh, no.

00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:35,143
Thank you.
I just wanna get my bearings a bit.

33
00:03:35,223 --> 00:03:36,383
Uh... okay.

34
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,263
- See you around?
- Mm-hmm.

35
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:08,423
Go along with whatever I say.

36
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:11,023
- Sorry?
- Whatever I say, go along with it.

37
00:04:12,783 --> 00:04:15,303
Okay, Wes, you're just pestering now.

38
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:19,303
- Do I have to red light you?
- Two hours 35.

39
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:20,863
- There's not much time left.
- Wes.

40
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:21,943
Look...

41
00:04:22,743 --> 00:04:26,383
- Last week, we had the most amazing...
- Last week was last week.

42

I need to talk with my friend here, okay?
Haven't seen her in a while.

43
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:33,703
Wes, she's sick.

44
00:04:33,783 --> 00:04:35,703
Like "six months to live" sick.

45
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:36,903
Five, actually.

46
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,783
I need to catch up with her.
Private time.

47
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:44,983
Okay.

48
00:04:46,983 --> 00:04:47,983
Okay.

49
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:51,543
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

50
00:04:52,503 --> 00:04:53,103
See you around?

51
00:04:54,943 --> 00:04:55,823
Sure.

52
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,983
Sorry for killing you.

53
00:05:01,063 --> 00:05:03,023
The whole "six months to live" thing?

54
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,863
Sorry. Five.

55
00:05:05,423 --> 00:05:07,623
Five was a nice touch.

56
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:10,903
- Kelly.
- Yorkie.

57
00:05:10,983 --> 00:05:13,463
- Yurgie?
- Yorkie.

58
00:05:13,543 --> 00:05:15,383
Like the dog breed?

59
00:05:16,343 --> 00:05:17,343
Yeah.

60
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:22,343
He's not a bad guy. I feel kinda bad.

61
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:25,823
- Met him at the Quagmire so...
- What's the Quagmire?

62
00:05:27,183 --> 00:05:29,783
If you don't already know
what the Quagmire is,

63
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,823
you probably don't wanna know.

64
00:05:31,903 --> 00:05:32,903
No?

65
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:35,103
You want another one?

66
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:37,983
- Oh, no, I...
- Yeah, you do. Come on.

67
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:39,743
Do I have to tug your leash?

68
00:05:44,903 --> 00:05:47,703
- Hey, Blondie.
- I'm Blondie?

69
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:50,063
You are. Jack and Coke times two.

70
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:52,303
- Oh, no. Mine was just a Coke.
- Times two.

71
00:06:02,183 --> 00:06:05,703
- What are you doing?
- I'm... regarding you.

72
00:06:06,303 --> 00:06:09,143
I feel like I'm being analysed.

73
00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:12,063
- Why the glasses?
- Um...

74
00:06:12,143 --> 00:06:15,463
I like them. They totally work on you.
But do you need them?

75
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,223
- Yeah, the lenses don't do anything.
- Knew it!

76
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:21,623
I used to wear them in school.

77
00:06:21,703 --> 00:06:24,823
So I guess now
they're just kind of a... comfort thing.

78
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:27,303
I figured they were
kind of a fashion statement.

79
00:06:27,863 --> 00:06:29,823
- Really?
- But then the rest of your outfit is not.

80
00:06:31,263 --> 00:06:35,743
Don't take that wrong.
It's refreshing. I mean, look around.

81
00:06:36,703 --> 00:06:40,063
People try so hard to look
how they think they should look.

82
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:42,983
They probably saw it in some movie.

83
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:45,863
But I like these.

84
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,223
You're authentically you.

85
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:51,703
Thanks.

86
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,183
Cheers.

87
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,743
You never tasted it before?

88
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,183
No, I...

89
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:06,983
I just haven't had it in a while.
It's good.

90
00:07:07,543 --> 00:07:08,743
Do you live here?

91
00:07:09,543 --> 00:07:11,463
- No. Oh, uh...
- Tourist?

92
00:07:13,343 --> 00:07:15,903
We'll go with tourist.
So you're new here?

93
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:19,783
- First night.
- First night? Wow, okay!

- Yes, you can, come on.

- Everyone was looking.
- Looking?

122
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:54,223
Yeah. You know, two girls dancing.

123
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,343
Okay, one, folks are way less uptight
than they used to be.

124
00:09:57,423 --> 00:10:01,103
And two, this is a party town.
No one's judging.

125
00:10:01,943 --> 00:10:07,863
Face it. If they were staring,
it's because I am bodacious.

126
00:10:10,663 --> 00:10:13,583
- You're stupid.
- Thank you!

127
00:10:19,863 --> 00:10:22,583
- I've never been on a dance floor.
- Never?

128
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:25,743
As in the whole time
you've been alive never?

129
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:27,783
Never.

130
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,743
What are you, like, Amish?

131
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:33,023
That's one sheltered existence
you got there.

132
00:10:33,103 --> 00:10:34,303
Yeah, well.

133
00:10:34,983 --> 00:10:38,023
As far as my family's concerned,
I can't do anything.

134
00:10:40,303 --> 00:10:44,543
Well, no one knows
about even half the shit I get up to.

135
00:10:46,303 --> 00:10:49,343
With your folks, though,
it's from a place of love, though, right?

136
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:51,103
- They worry.
- They don't worry.

137
00:10:52,663 --> 00:10:57,543
Just the concept of me enjoying myself
would blow their minds.

138
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:03,463
What would you like to do?
That you've never done?

139
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:08,423
Oh...

140
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:12,583
So many things.

141
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,663
San Junipero is a party town.

142
00:11:18,623 --> 00:11:20,023
All up for grabs.

143
00:11:21,863 --> 00:11:23,543
Midnight's two hours away.

144
00:11:25,343 --> 00:11:26,223
Oh, that's not long.

145
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,863
Why waste time sitting here?

146
00:11:34,743 --> 00:11:36,423
I, um...

147
00:11:38,143 --> 00:11:39,543
- Listen...
- It's okay.

148
00:11:39,623 --> 00:11:41,983
- No, I mean...
- Really, it's okay.

149
00:11:42,063 --> 00:11:46,943
No, I'm, uh...
I'm engaged. I have a fiancé.

150
00:11:47,943 --> 00:11:51,663
- He's called Greg.
- And is Greg here?

151
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:55,303
- No, he's...
- Elsewhere?

152
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:56,623
Yeah.

153
00:11:57,143 --> 00:11:57,943
Oh.

154
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:01,623
Wanna go to bed with me?

155
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:05,183
We could be back at mine in like...

156
00:12:06,663 --> 00:12:08,823
I never did anything like that.

157
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:11,263
All the more reason.

158
00:12:12,863 --> 00:12:14,143
Oh, you're nice.

159
00:12:16,463 --> 00:12:18,943
- I can't.
- Okay.

160
00:12:21,183 --> 00:12:23,743
- I just... I can't.
- I get it.

161
00:12:25,863 --> 00:12:28,863

- Look, I know I'm coming across...

180
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:27,703
- I'm red lighting you, for real. Okay?
- No, don't do that. Just...

181
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,423
- Then stop this.
- Can you hear me out? Please? Please.

182
00:14:33,063 --> 00:14:35,063
How many girls do you think there are
in San Junipero?

183
00:14:35,143 --> 00:14:36,663
Hundreds? Thousands?

184
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:37,783
I don't care.

185
00:14:37,863 --> 00:14:40,463
I'm saying there's plenty
of other girls out there for you, Wes.

186
00:14:40,543 --> 00:14:42,863
The locals? They're like dead people.

187
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,023
A little lively for dead people.

188
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:48,703
Look, I don't want some kind
of boring romance, okay?

189
00:14:48,783 --> 00:14:51,583
Like, Jesus,
put us in a retirement home deal.

190
00:14:51,663 --> 00:14:54,103
Well, if you're looking for someone
to fuck, there's options.

191
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:56,543
- Hang out at the Quagmire again.
- It's not just sex.

192
00:14:56,623 --> 00:14:58,623
- It was just sex.
- No, we made a connection.

193
00:14:58,703 --> 00:15:00,503
Wes, it was just sex.

194
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:03,823
- No...
- No roots.

195
00:15:05,743 --> 00:15:07,183
We had fun.

196
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:09,783
I'm sorry.

197
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:15,063
Enjoy the town, for God's sake.

198
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,343
- Hey.
- Hey.

199
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:29,183
Waiting for someone?

200
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,943
Not really.

201
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,063
I'll get you a drink?

202
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:36,143
Uh, yeah, sure.

203
00:15:54,263 --> 00:15:57,263
So, uh... yeah,
it was microsurgery, I guess.

204
00:15:57,343 --> 00:16:00,143
You know, both my kneecaps
had kind of just worn down.

205
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:08,463
You know, I never got this song.
Kind of weird.

206
00:16:10,183 --> 00:16:12,623
- Shall we dance?
- Sure.

I'd put my mind to, like, computing.

210
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,543
You know, caught that first wave,
would have had a different story.

211
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:09,783
Gotta use the bathroom.

212
00:17:11,783 --> 00:17:12,783
Okay.

213
00:17:33,263 --> 00:17:36,903
- I don't know how to do this.
- Do what?

214
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,543
Just help me.

215
00:17:45,303 --> 00:17:46,703
Can you just...

216
00:17:47,823 --> 00:17:51,343
Just make this easy for me?

217
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:03,823
You wanna get in my car?

218
00:18:13,663 --> 00:18:15,823
- How long have you been here?
- Sorry?

219
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:19,663
- How long have you been here?
- In San Junipero?

220
00:18:20,623 --> 00:18:25,543
Uh... Couple of months.
Plan is long enough to enjoy myself.

221
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:28,183
Guess I'm a tourist, like you.

222
00:18:30,303 --> 00:18:31,303
Yeah.

223
00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:37,583
Hey. You okay?

224
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:39,623
Yeah.

225
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:44,303
Stop!

226
00:18:56,463 --> 00:18:58,023
Sorry, but...

227
00:18:59,383 --> 00:19:00,943
Man, your face!

228
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:33,703
Wow.

229
00:19:34,463 --> 00:19:37,703
- You like it?
- It's just so big.

230
00:19:39,663 --> 00:19:41,463
Reminds me of where I grew up.

231
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,414
_

232
00:19:48,663 --> 00:19:50,183
Miss your mom?

233
00:20:26,263 --> 00:20:28,903
You have to show me.

234
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,183
- Okay.
- Okay.

235
00:20:48,903 --> 00:20:51,343
You never slept with a woman before?

236
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:58,543
That's not a critique.
I mean, it was fucking awesome.

237
00:21:03,343 --> 00:21:04,943
No, never with a woman.

238
00:21:07,343 --> 00:21:09,583
Never with anyone.

239
00:21:10,823 --> 00:21:12,543
Not anyone?

240
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:17,503
- What, in town or...?
- No. No one, nowhere.

241
00:21:20,303 --> 00:21:24,343
- I guess you deflowered me.
- I deflowered you?

242
00:21:25,503 --> 00:21:27,303
What is this? Merry England?

243
00:21:27,383 --> 00:21:29,623
Shut up.

244
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,703
You've had relationships though.

245
00:21:37,783 --> 00:21:38,583
Mnh-mnh.

246
00:21:39,503 --> 00:21:41,663
Hello! You got a fiancé.

247
00:21:43,263 --> 00:21:47,263
- It's complicated.
- Yeah, I'll say.

248
00:21:51,703 --> 00:21:53,623
When did you know...

249
00:21:55,423 --> 00:21:59,183
- that you liked women?
- I like men too.

250
00:22:00,103 --> 00:22:00,903
Equal rights.

251
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,023
Okay.

252
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:09,263
But when did you know?

253
00:22:11,543 --> 00:22:13,543
Do you always know?

254
00:22:20,063 --> 00:22:24,143
I was married to a guy.
A long time, I was married.

255
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:28,583
I always knew.

256
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:32,503
I mean, I'd be attracted to other girls,

257
00:22:33,383 --> 00:22:39,143
co-workers, friends,
some waitress that served me.

258
00:22:40,863 --> 00:22:44,583
They were crushes.
God, they were crushes.

259
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:50,583
Never acted on any of it.

260
00:22:54,783 --> 00:22:56,383
Never did anything.

261
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:03,423
I was in love with him.

262
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:08,423
I really was in love with him.

263
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:15,623
But he chose not to stick around.

264
00:23:20,143 --> 00:23:25,743
So now it's me.
And I'm passing through.

265
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:30,183
And before I leave,
I'll have a good time.

266
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:34,583
I'm just gonna have a good time.

267
00:23:46,823 --> 00:23:47,983
Time's nearly up.

268
00:23:51,103 --> 00:23:52,823

271
00:24:45,783 --> 00:24:47,103
Have you seen Kelly?

272
00:24:47,183 --> 00:24:49,023
- What's that?
- Kelly.

273
00:24:49,943 --> 00:24:51,463
I haven't seen her all night.

274
00:24:53,663 --> 00:24:55,303
You tried the Quagmire?

275
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,223
What is the Quagmire?

276
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:34,743
- Whoa! Hey!
- I'm sorry!

277
00:26:36,223 --> 00:26:38,623
Yeah, I know you from somewhere.

278
00:26:40,663 --> 00:26:41,943
Tucker's.

279
00:26:42,623 --> 00:26:45,183
- Kelly's friend, huh?
- Do you know where to find her?

280
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:48,823
- How would I know that?
- You're her friend.

281
00:26:50,183 --> 00:26:52,703
- <i>Was</i> a friend.
- Has she been here?

282
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:54,863
No.

283
00:26:57,023 --> 00:27:00,423
You too, huh?

284
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:02,583
Well...

285
00:27:06,063 --> 00:27:09,103
Hey. Try a different time.

00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:14,383
Here in '80, the '90s, 2002 one time.

Mid-20s, brown hair, glasses?

- How many of them are dead?

333
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,943

- I know, and I'm sorry, whatever it's...

337

I said I wouldn't...

338

I don't know, do feelings.

339
00:33:20,863 --> 00:33:22,463

- I have to.

00:34:30,983 --> 00:34:33,143
He really is a good guy.

352
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:39,303
I mean, my family don't approve, but...

353
00:34:40,743 --> 00:34:42,543
they can't stop us.

354
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:51,143
I know he pities me. That pisses me off.

355
00:34:53,503 --> 00:34:57,183
But that's not fair 'cause he's...

356
00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:09,663
You said you don't know
how much time there is.

357
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:12,103
What does that mean?

358
00:35:18,903 --> 00:35:20,583
They tell me three months.

359
00:35:22,823 --> 00:35:25,463
It's spread basically everywhere.

360
00:35:27,423 --> 00:35:29,983
They said three months before
six months ago.

361
00:35:30,063 --> 00:35:31,983
So, you know, what do they know?

362
00:35:35,863 --> 00:35:37,663
Doesn't even taste of anything.

363
00:35:40,983 --> 00:35:45,223
- But so you'll stay here after?
- No.

364
00:35:45,903 --> 00:35:49,023
When I'm done, I am done.

365
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:51,343
But that's cra... I mean...

366
00:35:52,903 --> 00:35:55,663
- Why?
- Richard.

367
00:35:57,423 --> 00:35:58,423
That's...

368
00:36:01,423 --> 00:36:03,183
My husband's name was Richard.

369
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,743
He died just two years ago.

370
00:36:10,223 --> 00:36:13,663
So we had the opportunity
to stay in San Junipero.

371
00:36:13,743 --> 00:36:14,743
Pass over.

372
00:36:16,903 --> 00:36:17,943
Didn't take it.

373
00:36:19,503 --> 00:36:22,543
- Didn't want to take it.
- Why wouldn't anyone take it?

374
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:26,383
He had his viewpoint.

375
00:36:28,863 --> 00:36:33,383
There were things he believed
and things he didn't believe in,

376
00:36:33,463 --> 00:36:35,143
and this place was one of them.

377
00:36:37,103 --> 00:36:39,983
Wouldn't even visit. Take the trial run.

378
00:36:40,063 --> 00:36:41,303
Shit.

379
00:36:43,423 --> 00:36:47,823
I didn't know if I wanted to try it
but... I mean...

380
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:53,743
Jesus, without this place,
I never would've met someone like you.

381
00:36:53,823 --> 00:36:57,783
- Yeah, you could have.
- No, I wouldn't.

382
00:36:57,863 --> 00:37:00,103
- We could have met outside all this.
- No.

383
00:37:01,543 --> 00:37:05,543
You... would not have got me at all.

384
00:37:08,703 --> 00:37:09,703
At all.

385
00:37:11,543 --> 00:37:14,663
If we really met, I mean...

386
00:37:14,743 --> 00:37:18,143
If we <i>really</i> met, you wouldn't like me.

387
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,063
Try me.

388
00:37:20,983 --> 00:37:24,423
Or you'd...
You wouldn't want to spend time with me.

389
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:26,743
- You'd come and then...
- Try me.

390
00:37:26,823 --> 00:37:27,823
Why?

391
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:31,423
Why? What's the point?

392
00:37:31,503 --> 00:37:33,623
What? Where are you? Houston?

393
00:37:35,143 --> 00:37:36,343
Carson City, Nevada.

394
00:37:37,983 --> 00:37:39,463
So come on.

395
00:37:40,223 --> 00:37:42,623
I showed you mine.

396
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,503
Where are you?

397
00:37:46,943 --> 00:37:50,023
- I can just look it up.
- Santa Rosa, California.

398
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:53,823
- That's no distance.
- I don't want you to...

399
00:37:57,583 --> 00:38:01,023
- I don't want you to see me. I'm scared...
- And I'm dying.

400
00:38:02,423 --> 00:38:05,023
Whatever you are can't scare me.

401
00:38:08,823 --> 00:38:10,343
Let me come visit.

402
00:38:12,183 --> 00:38:13,903
I want to say hi.

403
00:38:40,456 --> 00:38:41,668
_

404
00:38:56,383 --> 00:38:57,823
Here you go.

405
00:39:21,543 --> 00:39:22,343
You okay?

406
00:39:31,863 --> 00:39:34,623
<i>Please check in at our self-service pods</i>

407
00:39:34,703 --> 00:39:36,503
<i>using swipe cards provided.</i>

408
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:41,263
- You must be Kelly.
- I guess I must.

409
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:43,583
- She's waiting for you.
- Thank you.

410
00:39:46,063 --> 00:39:48,383
Please.

411
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,943
She won't be able
to physically respond in any way.

412
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:53,863
But she can hear you.

413
00:39:55,543 --> 00:39:56,983
I'll give you some privacy.

414
00:40:31,023 --> 00:40:32,303
Hello, stupid.

415
00:40:34,903 --> 00:40:36,223
It's good to see you.

416
00:40:50,943 --> 00:40:56,143
Uh... Hello. Excuse me. Is it... Kelly?

417
00:40:57,983 --> 00:40:59,023
It is.

418
00:41:00,423 --> 00:41:03,263
- I'm Greg.
- You're Greg?

419
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,663
Holy shit.

420
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:10,503
Yeah, I think it's great
that you came down here in person

421
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:11,863
before she passes over.

422
00:41:11,943 --> 00:41:13,703
Even her folks
don't come visit no more so...

423
00:41:13,783 --> 00:41:15,063
She's passing over?

424
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:20,023
- When?
- Uh...

425
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,463
- Let's go grab a coffee.
- Okay.

426
00:41:24,343 --> 00:41:27,143
- She didn't tell you?
- No, she did not.

427
00:41:28,023 --> 00:41:32,743
- Said she was just visiting.
- More like sampling the trial version.

428
00:41:34,903 --> 00:41:40,463
I mean, I've only known her
the past three years.

429
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:43,503
We talk on the comm box.

430
00:41:46,143 --> 00:41:49,223
She told you how she ended up
quadriplegic?

431
00:41:49,303 --> 00:41:51,143
And how long she's been that way?

432
00:41:52,903 --> 00:41:57,263
One night, she's 21,
comes out to her folks.

433
00:41:57,343 --> 00:42:00,023
They're a little uptight about it,
you might say.

434
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:02,863
They told her they don't
want a gay daughter.

435
00:42:02,943 --> 00:42:05,023
It's not natural and so forth.

436
00:42:05,103 --> 00:42:09,143
They fight. She gets in her car.
Runs it off the road. Boom!

437
00:42:09,223 --> 00:42:12,343
- When she was 21?
- More than 40 years back.

438
00:42:12,423 --> 00:42:15,463
It's been her whole lifetime, basically.

439
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:18,063
So the whole San Junipero system
has been a big deal for her.

440
00:42:18,143 --> 00:42:19,663
The biggest deal.

441
00:42:19,743 --> 00:42:24,663
Of course now, until she passes over,
it goes permanent,

442
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:27,143
she's on a five-hour weekly limit.

443
00:42:27,223 --> 00:42:29,103
I guess you're the same.

444
00:42:29,183 --> 00:42:32,663
They ration it out.
They don't trust us with more.

445
00:42:32,743 --> 00:42:35,743
They say you go crazy
if you have too much, you know?

446
00:42:35,823 --> 00:42:38,703
You don't leave your seat.
You disassociate body from mind.

447
00:42:38,783 --> 00:42:42,823
Like that doesn't happen
in every senior home already.

448
00:42:43,703 --> 00:42:46,143
The system's there
for therapeutic reasons,

449
00:42:46,223 --> 00:42:49,183
immersive nostalgia therapy.

450
00:42:49,263 --> 00:42:51,783
Plunge you into a world of memories.

451
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,863
Helps with Alzheimer's,
that's what they say.

452
00:42:55,943 --> 00:42:57,183
Small mercies.

453
00:42:58,703 --> 00:42:59,823
So...

454
00:43:01,103 --> 00:43:02,863
About this marriage...

455
00:43:05,103 --> 00:43:08,183
The state's got a triple lockdown
on euthanasia cases.

456
00:43:08,263 --> 00:43:12,383
You gotta have a sign-off from the doc,
the patient, a family member.

457
00:43:12,463 --> 00:43:16,863
It's to stop folks from passing over just
because they prefer San Junipero flat out.

458
00:43:16,943 --> 00:43:18,783
Anyhow, Yorkie's family,

459
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:22,063
they're big-time religious,
and they will not sign.

460
00:43:22,143 --> 00:43:24,383
But a spouse can override them.

461
00:43:25,423 --> 00:43:28,583
- Hence the wedding bells.
- You got it.

462
00:43:28,663 --> 00:43:30,703
We got a pastor coming tomorrow a.m.,

463
00:43:30,783 --> 00:43:33,623
and then she's scheduled to pass
tomorrow afternoon.

464
00:43:33,703 --> 00:43:37,063
"Scheduled to pass."
Let's just call it dying.

465
00:43:37,143 --> 00:43:39,143
If you can call it dying.

466
00:43:39,223 --> 00:43:42,343
Uploaded to the cloud, sounds like heaven.

467
00:43:43,303 --> 00:43:44,503
I guess.

468
00:43:46,263 --> 00:43:47,663
You gonna wear a suit?

469
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,943
The ceremony's on my coffee break.

470
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:56,823
I never married so I just figured,
you know, what's the harm?

471
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,223
You're a good man.

472
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,703
It's the least I could do, right?

473
00:44:06,423 --> 00:44:09,543
Think you could hook us up
to the system now?

474
00:44:09,623 --> 00:44:12,663
Just for a little while,
before she passes?

475
00:44:12,743 --> 00:44:16,343
You can still see her afterwards.
I mean, then she's no limit.

476
00:44:16,423 --> 00:44:19,263
She's full, fat, permanent San Juniperan.

477
00:44:19,343 --> 00:44:21,503
I know, but can you?

478
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:24,183
Seriously, it is so tight here
that they monitor every...

479
00:44:24,263 --> 00:44:26,223
I only want a moment.

480
00:44:44,423 --> 00:44:45,223
Ma'am.

481
00:44:46,663 --> 00:44:49,303
- You got five minutes
- Thank you.

482
00:45:02,943 --> 00:45:04,143
Hey!

483
00:45:06,383 --> 00:45:08,503
I've never been here
during the daylight.

484
00:45:09,703 --> 00:45:10,503
It's warm.

485
00:45:11,423 --> 00:45:14,223
Listen, I gotta be quick.
So I spoke to Greg.

486
00:45:14,303 --> 00:45:15,423
Oh.

487
00:45:16,903 --> 00:45:20,583
- You're passing over tomorrow?
- Yeah.

488
00:45:20,663 --> 00:45:22,383
Couple of hours after the wedding.

489
00:45:23,143 --> 00:45:27,543
So I guess I am technically
honeymooning here forever.

490
00:45:29,423 --> 00:45:31,263
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

491
00:45:34,143 --> 00:45:37,383
- I'm gonna say something crazy.
- Okay.

492
00:45:41,783 --> 00:45:43,183
Wanna marry me instead?

493
00:45:45,103 --> 00:45:48,143
It's just... Greg seems great, but...

494
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:51,783
Why not someone you've connected with?

495
00:46:00,863 --> 00:46:02,623
Is that a yes?

496
00:46:05,343 --> 00:46:07,143
...to be your lawfully wedded wife,

497
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:12,383
to have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,

498
00:46:13,623 --> 00:46:18,263
in good times and in woe,
for richer, for poorer...

499
00:46:30,118 --> 00:46:32,662
_

500
00:47:51,423 --> 00:47:52,583
Hold tight.

501
00:47:54,863 --> 00:47:56,223
There you go.

502
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:01,543
Nearly there.

503
00:48:03,703 --> 00:48:04,783
That's it.

504
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,783
Are you sure you're all right?

505
00:48:47,743 --> 00:48:48,863
Hey!

506
00:48:58,023 --> 00:48:59,583
You didn't dress up to see me?

507
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,343
Oh...

508
00:49:01,423 --> 00:49:02,863
Come on!

509
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,103
Better?

510
00:49:09,223 --> 00:49:10,223
Whoop!

511
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:14,623
Oh!

512
00:49:16,383 --> 00:49:17,783
Oh! Whoo!

513
00:49:26,623 --> 00:49:28,503
Looks so real.

514
00:49:31,223 --> 00:49:33,543
It feels so real!

515
00:49:40,463 --> 00:49:45,303
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I love it here!

516
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:46,383
I just love it.

517
00:49:46,463 --> 00:49:50,143
- You've been here before.
- But now I live here!

518
00:49:51,703 --> 00:49:52,943
Be with me.

519
00:49:54,383 --> 00:49:57,903
- I'm with you now.
- That's not what I mean.

520
00:49:59,823 --> 00:50:01,183
Pass over.

521
00:50:02,343 --> 00:50:05,463
- When it's your time.
- Yorkie.

522
00:50:05,543 --> 00:50:08,903
- Stay here with me.
- Can we just enjoy tonight?

523
00:50:08,983 --> 00:50:10,983
It's almost midnight.

524
00:50:11,063 --> 00:50:12,423
In ten minutes, you're out of here.

525
00:50:12,503 --> 00:50:14,143
Then I gotta wait a week
to see you again.

526
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:17,343
- You know I'm just a visitor.
- What, a couple of months, then what?

527
00:50:17,423 --> 00:50:20,143
- We're not discussing this.
- Then you're gone.

528
00:50:20,223 --> 00:50:24,063
- Just gone. You could have forever.
- Forever?

529
00:50:24,143 --> 00:50:27,383
- Who can even make sense of forever?
- However long you want then.

530
00:50:27,463 --> 00:50:30,063
I mean, you can remove yourself
like that.

531
00:50:30,143 --> 00:50:31,943
It's not a trap.

532
00:50:32,023 --> 00:50:35,423
I mean, look at it! Jesus! Touch it!

533
00:50:35,503 --> 00:50:37,823
- I'm going.
- Hey! Oh. Hey.

534
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,703
It's real.

535
00:50:41,863 --> 00:50:44,263
This is real.

536
00:50:45,863 --> 00:50:47,503
And this.

537
00:50:49,023 --> 00:50:50,543
- Hmm?
- Come on.

538
00:50:50,623 --> 00:50:52,463
You know that was just a gesture.

539
00:50:54,423 --> 00:50:58,143
- You married me.
- To help you pass over.

540
00:50:58,223 --> 00:51:03,103
- As a... kindness.
- It's not so kind to leave.

541
00:51:07,103 --> 00:51:10,143
Okay, look, look, I'm sorry, I just...

542
00:51:12,143 --> 00:51:13,943
I got this chance.

543
00:51:15,703 --> 00:51:18,823
<i>We</i> got this chance.
I wanna share it with you.

544
00:51:21,223 --> 00:51:23,863
I said I made my choice.

545
00:51:23,943 --> 00:51:27,063
What is it? You feel bad
because your husband isn't here?

546
00:51:27,863 --> 00:51:30,743
- Because that was his choice.
- Don't.

547
00:51:30,823 --> 00:51:33,503
He chose not to stay here.
It's like he left you.

548
00:51:34,463 --> 00:51:37,543
You know, he could have stayed,
but he chose to leave you.

549
00:51:37,623 --> 00:51:39,903
- You don't know what you're saying.
- You should be mad at him.

550
00:51:39,983 --> 00:51:42,023
- Not whipping yourself with guilt.
- Get off me.

551
00:51:42,103 --> 00:51:45,983
You can't see it!
But what he did, it was selfish actually!

552
00:51:50,663 --> 00:51:52,103
Forty-nine years...

553
00:51:54,263 --> 00:51:59,543
I was with him for 49 years.

554
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:03,143
You can't begin to imagine.

555
00:52:04,303 --> 00:52:05,863
You can't know...

556
00:52:07,703 --> 00:52:11,263
the bond, the commitment, the boredom,

557
00:52:11,343 --> 00:52:13,703
the yearning, the laughter,
the love of it.

558
00:52:13,783 --> 00:52:16,343
The fucking love. You just cannot know!

559
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:20,463
Everything we sacrificed.

560
00:52:21,903 --> 00:52:25,423
The years I gave him.
The years he gave me.

561
00:52:25,503 --> 00:52:26,863
Did you think to ask?

562
00:52:28,823 --> 00:52:31,423
Did it occur to you to ask?

563
00:52:33,983 --> 00:52:35,383
We had a daughter.

564
00:52:38,103 --> 00:52:39,343
Alison.

565
00:52:41,263 --> 00:52:44,143
Always difficult, always beautiful.

566
00:52:44,223 --> 00:52:46,943
Died at 39 years old, bless her heart.

567
00:52:47,023 --> 00:52:50,103
And Richard and I,
we felt that heartbreak as one.

568
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:54,303
You think you're the only person
ever suffered, go fuck yourself.

569
00:52:54,383 --> 00:52:56,583
- Well, I didn't know...
- Didn't think to.

570
00:52:58,143 --> 00:53:00,663
You know, when he was dying,
Richard said to me

571
00:53:00,743 --> 00:53:04,383
when they offered him this,
to pass over, pass through,

572
00:53:04,463 --> 00:53:07,143
spend eternity in this fucking graveyard
you're so in love with,

573
00:53:07,223 --> 00:53:12,903
he said, "How can I?
When she missed out, how can I?"

574
00:53:14,183 --> 00:53:15,383
And so he went.

575
00:53:16,783 --> 00:53:19,783
And I wish I could believe he's
with her now,

576
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,503
that they're together, but I don't.

577
00:53:22,463 --> 00:53:25,423
I believe they're nowhere.
Just like you said.

578
00:53:26,023 --> 00:53:30,103
Gone. No, I pitied you,
and that's the truth. I pitied you.

579
00:53:30,183 --> 00:53:31,583
Now you give me some sales pitch

580
00:53:31,663 --> 00:53:33,543
about how fucking peachy forever
could be.

581
00:53:33,623 --> 00:53:34,663
I'm sorry.

582
00:53:34,743 --> 00:53:36,943
You wanna spend forever
somewhere nothing matters?

583
00:53:37,783 --> 00:53:39,823
End up like Wes?

584
00:53:39,903 --> 00:53:43,023
All those lost fucks at the Quagmire

585
00:53:43,103 --> 00:53:45,183
trying anything to feel something,
go ahead.

586
00:53:46,463 --> 00:53:49,183
But I'm out. I'm gone.

587
00:53:52,463 --> 00:53:56,143
Kelly, I'm sorry. Kelly!

588
00:54:27,814 --> 00:54:28,625
_

589
00:56:10,703 --> 00:56:12,183
Hey, Kelly.

590
00:56:14,023 --> 00:56:17,183
- You all right?
- Yeah, I am fine.

591
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:17,023
- Well, okay then.
- Huh?

592
00:57:21,463 --> 00:57:22,463
Kelly?

593
00:57:23,543 --> 00:57:25,703
All things considered...

594
00:57:27,743 --> 00:57:29,183
I guess I'm ready.

595
00:57:31,703 --> 00:57:32,823
For what?

596
00:57:36,103 --> 00:57:38,103
