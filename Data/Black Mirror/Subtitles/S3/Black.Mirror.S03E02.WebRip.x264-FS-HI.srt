A map coordinate thing.

183
00:22:13,094 --> 00:22:16,574
- And there's a car we need to get.
- A car? What sort of car?

184
00:22:17,894 --> 00:22:21,331
I don't know what sort of car.
They said it's in the car park outside.

185
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:23,694
They sent me a licence plate.
That's all I know.

186
00:22:25,054 --> 00:22:26,414
Why both of us?

187
00:22:27,894 --> 00:22:29,254
I don't know!

188
00:22:30,534 --> 00:22:32,931
Just let me deal with my
fucking shoe, please.

189
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,214

191
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:38,562
[man] What have they said?

192
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:43,094
They say, "Go with him.
Take the package."

193
00:22:45,854 --> 00:22:47,047
Okay.

194
00:23:00,494 --> 00:23:03,254
"V760 DHM."

195
00:23:05,654 --> 00:23:07,494
V760 DHM.

196
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:11,371
I'm getting fucking
number blindness here.

197
00:23:11,374 --> 00:23:12,494
That's it.

198
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:20,702
All right. They said the
keys are on the back. Okay.

199
00:23:26,494 --> 00:23:28,131
[exhales]

200
00:23:28,134 --> 00:23:30,611
Look, maybe you better
drive. Do you drive?

201
00:23:30,614 --> 00:23:34,131
- I mean, I had a drink back there.
- I can't. I can... I can drive.

202
00:23:34,134 --> 00:23:35,611
I'm still learning.
Haven't passed my test yet.

203
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:38,734
All right. Uh... You're navigating.

204
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,211
Okay, you've got a sat nav on your phone?

205
00:23:41,214 --> 00:23:42,374
Yep.

206
00:23:43,734 --> 00:23:45,851
Here it is. Punch that in.

207
00:23:45,854 --> 00:23:49,291
It's a street somewhere out of town.
Sort of High Wycombe-ish.

208
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:52,654
They said we got to be there by two.
It's gonna be tight.

209
00:23:54,414 --> 00:23:55,774
[starts engine]

210
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:08,134
So I'm guessing they got some shit on
you that they're threatening to put out?

211
00:24:15,694 --> 00:24:16,694
With me, it's...

212
00:24:19,294 --> 00:24:21,614
You saw the room, fucking lacy knickers.

213
00:24:23,054 --> 00:24:25,211
I was waiting for a prostitute.

214
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,574
Escort, hooker, whatever
they call them now.

215
00:24:28,614 --> 00:24:30,854
I got a family, which is great.

216
00:24:33,414 --> 00:24:34,494
You get bored.

217
00:24:35,854 --> 00:24:37,814
I mean, when I was young, I used to like...

218
00:24:39,254 --> 00:24:42,851
I can't fucking justify it.
I just wanted to fuck a 20-something.

219
00:24:42,854 --> 00:24:44,891
For old times' sake, I don't know.

220
00:24:44,894 --> 00:24:49,534
I joined this website. I was curious.
Just wanted to see what was on there.

221
00:24:50,094 --> 00:24:52,854
I got talking to Mindy,
who I thought was Mindy.

222
00:24:54,054 --> 00:24:58,051
I mean, she sent me pictures.
I sent some back.

223
00:24:58,054 --> 00:25:00,211
Phone photos. Grabbing my cock.

224
00:25:00,214 --> 00:25:02,811
You name it.
They got the whole fucking thing.

225
00:25:02,814 --> 00:25:06,451
But not just pictures, chat messages.
All the arrangements, where and when.

226
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:08,931
Me haggling over the price
and they say they got it all.

227
00:25:08,934 --> 00:25:11,411
Sucked up the whole hard
drive like an audit.

228
00:25:11,414 --> 00:25:16,171
Fucking twat. What a fucking idiot!

229
00:25:16,174 --> 00:25:19,331
If that shit gets out,
that's my wife out the door.

230
00:25:19,334 --> 00:25:21,251
Then there's the kids, she'll take them.

231
00:25:21,254 --> 00:25:24,451
Oh, no, not a doubt in my mind
she'd take them and she'd win.

232
00:25:24,454 --> 00:25:26,091
Custody, she'd win.

233
00:25:26,094 --> 00:25:29,811
And I'm not losing my kids.
I tell you that right now.

234
00:25:29,814 --> 00:25:32,411
No way! Absolutely fucking no!

235
00:25:32,414 --> 00:25:33,694
[sobs]

236
00:25:37,854 --> 00:25:39,734
They filmed me.

237
00:25:41,614 --> 00:25:44,214
- Filmed you...
- Through my computer camera.

238
00:25:45,174 --> 00:25:49,614
- What, like, filmed you?
- Yeah, like, you know, doing it.

239
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:55,014
- Like sex?
- No. Like, you... you know.

240
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,014
Jerking off. Jerking off
to porn or something?

241
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:01,294
Well, everyone does that.

242
00:26:02,174 --> 00:26:05,171
- The fucking pope probably does that.
- They're gonna put it everywhere.

243
00:26:05,174 --> 00:26:06,931
Like they're gonna send it to everyone.

244
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:08,811
- Oh, shit the fuck!
- What? What?

245
00:26:08,814 --> 00:26:11,611
- How long's that light been on?
- What light?

246
00:26:11,614 --> 00:26:13,894
Whoever's car this is,
they left it fucking empty.

247
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:24,096
I won't be a minute.

248
00:26:26,934 --> 00:26:29,294
Unleaded. Unleaded.

249
00:26:31,898 --> 00:26:32,898
Oh, bugger!

250
00:26:37,214 --> 00:26:39,894
Listen, you pay, yeah? It'll save time.

251
00:26:40,614 --> 00:26:41,534
Have you got any money?

252
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:47,771
Okay, Visa card PIN number 3109.
Say that back to me.

253
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,811
- Visa card...
- Just the number!

254
00:26:49,814 --> 00:26:52,134
- Uh... 3109.
- Okay, go!

255
00:26:56,054 --> 00:26:57,334
[man] Pump four!

[chattering]

257
00:27:20,454 --> 00:27:22,254
- What's your pump number?
- Four.

258
00:27:23,534 --> 00:27:25,374
- You want some chocolate?
- No.

259
00:27:25,934 --> 00:27:28,094
- It's two for one this week.
- I'm okay.

260
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,254
31.89.

261
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:36,894
Pop your PIN in.

- [man] No, no, of course not.

265
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:10,651
- I'll get on to that. Make some calls.
- Brilliant! It's next Wednesday.

266
00:28:10,654 --> 00:28:13,731
- Okay.
- Keep it non-dairy just to be safe.

267
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:14,734
Okay.

268
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:20,374
This is, uh...

269
00:28:22,294 --> 00:28:24,171
my nephew.

270
00:28:24,174 --> 00:28:25,614
Nice to meet you.

271
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:29,054
- Kenny.
- Kenny. I'm Karen.

272
00:28:30,214 --> 00:28:32,294
We're both Ks. [laughs]

273
00:28:33,734 --> 00:28:37,411
I'm head of the PTA at Theo and
Cassie's school, for my sins.

274
00:28:37,414 --> 00:28:41,814
Just roped poor Hector into sorting
out the catering for the quiz night.

275
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,531
Been the usual balls up.

276
00:28:43,534 --> 00:28:45,731
Listen, we better get this
guy to the station.

277
00:28:45,734 --> 00:28:48,371
His train's... So we better go.

278
00:28:48,374 --> 00:28:51,171
- Cansroad Station?
- Yeah.

279
00:28:51,174 --> 00:28:53,371
Oh, couldn't drop me at the
end of my road, could you?

280
00:28:53,374 --> 00:28:54,774
It's on the way. Mayer Street?

281
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,331
It's the bus otherwise and that
goes all the way around the common.

282
00:28:57,334 --> 00:29:00,731
- We're in a bit of a rush, actually.
- Well, it's no detour. It's en route.

283
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:04,494
I'll hop out. Hardly need
to slow down. Yeah?

284
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:10,454
- Yep. Sure. Let's go.
- Brilliant. Thanks!

285
00:29:11,014 --> 00:29:12,174
I'll just get in the back.

286
00:29:15,974 --> 00:29:18,091
Oh, don't want to squash your box.

287
00:29:18,094 --> 00:29:20,014
- What's that? Present?
- It's a cake.

288
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:24,894
- It's just a... it's a cake for Penny.
- Oh, lucky her.

289
00:29:28,574 --> 00:29:30,051
So how is Penny?

290
00:29:30,054 --> 00:29:33,214
Haven't seen her since...
must have been sports day.

291
00:29:34,214 --> 00:29:35,651
She's good.

292
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:38,931
- She still planning to get back to work?
- Yeah. Yep.

He was so funny in the play.
That big top hat on.

298
00:29:51,494 --> 00:29:53,174
Yeah, he had a good time.

300
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:57,651
[Karen gasps] Oh, Anna's
having a sleepover.

301
00:29:57,654 --> 00:30:00,091
Cassie's probably
already told you about it.

302

Six nine-year-olds in the house.
I must be mad! [laughs]

So, Kenny, where you heading back to?

306
00:30:14,214 --> 00:30:16,934
- Sorry. What?
- Are you going home or...?

307
00:30:17,654 --> 00:30:19,614
- Uh...
- Train. Birmingham.

308

Yeah. Uh...

309
00:30:21,774 --> 00:30:25,891
- Yeah, I-I live in Birmingham.
- Oh, my husband's from Birmingham.

310
00:30:25,894 --> 00:30:27,491
- What part are you?
- South.

311
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,054
[Karen] South.

312
00:30:30,374 --> 00:30:32,771
- Mainly.
- Right.
