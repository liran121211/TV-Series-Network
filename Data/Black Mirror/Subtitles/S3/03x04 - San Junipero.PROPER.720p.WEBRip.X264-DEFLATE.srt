Kelly, come on.

- Kelly.
- I'm still walking, Wes.

8
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:24,183
We've only got a couple of hours
so let's, uh... let's use it.

9
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:25,183

You're good at this.

26
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:13,223
It's, uh... got different endings.

27
00:03:13,303 --> 00:03:15,383
Depending on if you're
in one or two player.

28
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:16,583
Uh-huh?

29
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,183
- It was kinda the first game to do that.
- Damn it!

30
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:24,383
Do you wanna play Top Speed?

31
00:03:27,183 --> 00:03:29,183
Oh, no.

32
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:35,943
Thank you. I just wanna
get my bearings a bit.

33
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:37,183
Uh... okay.

34
00:03:38,183 --> 00:03:40,063
- See you around?
- Mm-hmm.

35
00:04:07,263 --> 00:04:09,223
Go along with whatever I say.

36
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:11,823
- Sorry?
- Whatever I say, go along with it.

37
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,103
Okay, Wes, you're just pestering now.

38
00:04:16,783 --> 00:04:20,103
- Do I have to red light you?
- Two hours 35.

39
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:21,663
- There's not much time left.
- Wes.

40
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:22,743
Look...

41
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:27,183
- Last week, we had the most amazing...
- Last week was last week.

42
00:04:27,743 --> 00:04:31,823
I need to talk with my friend here,
okay? Haven't seen her in a while.

43
00:04:32,343 --> 00:04:34,503
Wes, she's sick.

44
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,503
Like "six months to live" sick.

45
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,703
Five, actually.

46
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:43,583
I need to catch up
with her. Private time.

47
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:45,783
Okay.

48
00:04:47,783 --> 00:04:48,783
Okay.

49
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:52,343
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

50
00:04:53,303 --> 00:04:53,903
See you around?

51
00:04:55,743 --> 00:04:56,623
Sure.

52
00:05:00,063 --> 00:05:01,783
Sorry for killing you.

53
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:03,823
The whole "six months to live" thing?

54
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,663
Sorry. Five.

55
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,423
Five was a nice touch.

56
00:05:09,223 --> 00:05:11,703
- Kelly.
- Yorkie.

57
00:05:11,783 --> 00:05:14,263
- Yurgie?
- Yorkie.

58
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:16,183
Like the dog breed?

59
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:18,143
Yeah.

60
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:23,143
He's not a bad guy. I feel kinda bad.

61
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:26,623
- Met him at the Quagmire so...
- What's the Quagmire?

62
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:30,583
If you don't already
know what the Quagmire is,

63
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,623
you probably don't wanna know.

64
00:05:32,703 --> 00:05:33,703
No?

65
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:35,903
You want another one?

66
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,783
- Oh, no, I...
- Yeah, you do. Come on.

67
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,543
Do I have to tug your leash?

68
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:48,503
- Hey, Blondie.
- I'm Blondie?

69
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,863
You are. Jack and Coke times two.

70
00:05:50,943 --> 00:05:53,103
- Oh, no. Mine was just a Coke.
- Times two.

71
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:06,503
- What are you doing?
- I'm... regarding you.

72
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,943
I feel like I'm being analysed.

73
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:12,863
- Why the glasses?
- Um...

74
00:06:12,943 --> 00:06:16,263
I like them. They totally work
on you. But do you need them?

75
00:06:16,863 --> 00:06:20,023
- Yeah, the lenses don't do anything.
- Knew it!

76
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:22,423
I used to wear them in school.

77
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:25,623
So I guess now they're just
kind of a... comfort thing.

78
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:28,103
I figured they were kind
of a fashion statement.

79
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:30,623
- Really?
- But then the rest of your outfit is not.

80
00:06:32,063 --> 00:06:36,543
Don't take that wrong. It's
refreshing. I mean, look around.

81
00:06:37,503 --> 00:06:40,863
People try so hard to look how
they think they should look.

82
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:43,783
They probably saw it in some movie.

83
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:46,663
But I like these.

84
00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:50,023
You're authentically you.

85
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:52,503
Thanks.

86
00:06:53,983 --> 00:06:54,983
Cheers.

87
00:07:01,663 --> 00:07:03,543
You never tasted it before?

88
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:04,983
No, I...

89
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:07,783
I just haven't had it
in a while. It's good.

90
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:09,543
Do you live here?

91
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:12,263
- No. Oh, uh...
- Tourist?

92
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:16,703
We'll go with tourist.
So you're new here?

93
00:07:16,823 --> 00:07:20,583
- First night.
- First night? Wow, okay!

94
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:25,623
Oh, my God!

95
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:27,383
We have to dance to this.

96
00:07:28,663 --> 00:07:29,983
- With each
other? - Uh-huh.

97
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:34,263
- Oh, no. Dance floors aren't my thing.
- Oh, let's not limit ourselves.

98
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:37,623
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can, come on.

99
00:07:37,703 --> 00:07:41,583
- No, I'll look dumb...

I... I said I'm not much of a dancer.

115
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:29,343
No shit.

116
00:09:29,423 --> 00:09:32,103
Like a frightened horse on
a frozen lake back there.

117
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:35,343
I'm kidding. Half kidding.

Sorry I pushed you into it.

119
00:09:39,183 --> 00:09:42,783
Saturday nights once a week. It's
like no time. I get impatient.

120
00:09:42,863 --> 00:09:45,743
No, no, it's not that. It's...

121
00:09:48,063 --> 00:09:50,223
- Everyone was looking.
- Looking?

122
00:09:51,143 --> 00:09:55,023
Yeah. You know, two girls dancing.

123
00:09:55,103 --> 00:09:58,143
Okay, one, folks are way less
uptight than they used to be.

124
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:01,903
And two, this is a party
town. No one's judging.

125
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:08,663
Face it. If they were staring,
it's because I am bodacious.

126
00:10:11,463 --> 00:10:14,383
- You're stupid.
- Thank you!

127
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:23,383
- I've never been on a dance floor.
- Never?

128
00:10:24,103 --> 00:10:26,543
As in the whole time
you've been alive never?

129
00:10:26,623 --> 00:10:28,583
Never.

130
00:10:29,303 --> 00:10:31,543
What are you, like, Amish?

131
00:10:31,623 --> 00:10:33,823
That's one sheltered
existence you got there.

132
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:35,103
Yeah, well.

133
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:38,823
As far as my family's
concerned, I can't do anything.

134
00:10:41,103 --> 00:10:45,343
Well, no one knows about even
half the shit I get up to.

135
00:10:47,103 --> 00:10:50,143
With your folks, though, it's from
a place of love, though, right?

136
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:51,903
- They worry.
- They don't worry.

137
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:58,343
Just the concept of me enjoying
myself would blow their minds.

138
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:04,263
What would you like to
do? That you've never done?

139
00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:09,223
Oh...

140
00:11:11,343 --> 00:11:13,383
So many things.

141
00:11:15,103 --> 00:11:17,463
San Junipero is a party town.

142
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,823
All up for grabs.

143
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:24,343
Midnight's two hours away.

144
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,023
Oh, that's not long.

145
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:31,663
Why waste time sitting here?

146
00:11:35,543 --> 00:11:37,223
I, um...

147
00:11:38,943 --> 00:11:40,343
- Listen...
- It's okay.

148
00:11:40,423 --> 00:11:42,783
- No, I mean...
- Really, it's okay.

149
00:11:42,863 --> 00:11:47,743
No, I'm, uh... I'm
engaged. I have a fiancé.

150
00:11:48,743 --> 00:11:52,463
- He's called Greg.
- And is Greg here?

151
00:11:53,783 --> 00:11:56,103
- No, he's...
- Elsewhere?

152
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,423
Yeah.

153
00:11:57,943 --> 00:11:58,743
Oh.

154
00:12:01,223 --> 00:12:02,423
Wanna go to bed with me?

155
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:05,983
We could be back at mine in like...

156
00:12:07,463 --> 00:12:09,623
I never did anything like that.

157
00:12:10,823 --> 00:12:12,063
All the more reason.

158
00:12:13,663 --> 00:12:14,943
Oh, you're nice.

159
00:12:17,263 --> 00:12:19,743
- I can't.
- Okay.

160
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:24,543
- I just... I can't.
- I get it.

161
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,663
- I have to go.
- In this?

162
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:31,703

- Look, I know I'm coming across...

180
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:28,503
- I'm red lighting you, for real. Okay?
- No, don't do that. Just...

181
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:32,223
- Then stop this.
- Can you hear me out? Please? Please.

182
00:14:33,863 --> 00:14:35,863
How many girls do you think
there are in San Junipero?

183
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:37,463
Hundreds? Thousands?

184
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,583
I don't care.

185
00:14:38,663 --> 00:14:41,263
I'm saying there's plenty of
other girls out there for you, Wes.

186
00:14:41,343 --> 00:14:43,663
The locals? They're like dead people.

187
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:45,823
A little lively for dead people.

188
00:14:46,983 --> 00:14:49,503
Look, I don't want some
kind of boring romance, okay?

189
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:52,383
Like, Jesus, put us in
a retirement home deal.

190
00:14:52,463 --> 00:14:54,903
Well, if you're looking for
someone to fuck, there's options.

191
00:14:54,983 --> 00:14:57,343
- Hang out at the Quagmire again.
- It's not just sex.

192
00:14:57,423 --> 00:14:59,423
- It was just sex.
- No, we made a connection.

193
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:01,303
Wes, it was just sex.

194
00:15:02,303 --> 00:15:04,623
- No...
- No roots.

195
00:15:06,543 --> 00:15:07,983
We had fun.

196
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:10,583
I'm sorry.

197
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:15,863
Enjoy the town, for God's sake.

198
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,143
- Hey.
- Hey.

199
00:15:28,743 --> 00:15:29,983
Waiting for someone?

200
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:32,743
Not really.

201
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:34,863
I'll get you a drink?

202
00:15:35,343 --> 00:15:36,943
Uh, yeah, sure.

203
00:15:55,063 --> 00:15:58,063
So, uh... yeah, it was
microsurgery, I guess.

204
00:15:58,143 --> 00:16:00,943
You know, both my kneecaps
had kind of just worn down.

205
00:16:05,743 --> 00:16:09,263
You know, I never got
this song. Kind of weird.

206
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:13,423

- Sure.

210
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:07,343
You know, caught that first wave,
would have had a different story.

211
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,583
Gotta use the bathroom.

212
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,583
Okay.

213
00:17:34,063 --> 00:17:37,703
- I don't know how to do this.
- Do what?

214
00:17:41,903 --> 00:17:43,343
Just help me.

215
00:17:46,103 --> 00:17:47,503
Can you just...

216
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:52,143
Just make this easy for me?

217
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:04,623
You wanna get in my car?

218
00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:16,623
- How long have you been here?
- Sorry?

219
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:20,463
- How long have you been here?
- In San Junipero?

220
00:18:21,423 --> 00:18:26,343
Uh... Couple of months. Plan
is long enough to enjoy myself.

221
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:28,983
Guess I'm a tourist, like you.

222
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:32,103
Yeah.

223
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:38,383
Hey. You okay?

224
00:18:39,543 --> 00:18:40,423
Yeah.

225
00:18:42,703 --> 00:18:45,103
Stop!

226
00:18:57,263 --> 00:18:58,823
Sorry, but...

227
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:01,743
Man, your face!

228
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:34,503
Wow.

229
00:19:35,263 --> 00:19:38,503
- You like it?
- It's just so big.

230
00:19:40,463 --> 00:19:42,263
Reminds me of where I grew up.

231
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,214
_

232
00:19:49,463 --> 00:19:50,983
Miss your mom?

233
00:20:27,063 --> 00:20:29,703
You have to show me.

234
00:20:30,623 --> 00:20:31,983
- Okay.
- Okay.

235
00:20:49,703 --> 00:20:52,143
You never slept with a woman before?

236
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:59,343
That's not a critique. I
mean, it was fucking awesome.

237
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:05,743
No, never with a woman.

238
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,383
Never with anyone.

239
00:21:11,623 --> 00:21:13,343
Not anyone?

240
00:21:14,463 --> 00:21:18,303
- What, in town or...?
- No. No one, nowhere.

241
00:21:21,103 --> 00:21:25,143
- I guess you deflowered me.
- I deflowered you?

242
00:21:26,303 --> 00:21:28,103
What is this? Merry England?

243
00:21:28,183 --> 00:21:30,423
Shut up.

244
00:21:35,383 --> 00:21:37,503
You've had relationships though.

245
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:39,383
Mnh-mnh.

246
00:21:40,303 --> 00:21:42,463
Hello! You got a fiancé.

247
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:48,063
- It's complicated.
- Yeah, I'll say.

248
00:21:52,503 --> 00:21:54,423
When did you know...

249
00:21:56,223 --> 00:21:59,983
- that you liked women?
- I like men too.

250
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:01,703
Equal rights.

251
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:06,823
Okay.

252
00:22:08,783 --> 00:22:10,063
But when did you know?

253
00:22:12,343 --> 00:22:14,343
Do you always know?

254
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:24,943
I was married to a guy. A
long time, I was married.

255
00:22:27,703 --> 00:22:29,383
I always knew.

256
00:22:29,463 --> 00:22:33,303
I mean, I'd be attracted to other girls,

257
00:22:34,183 --> 00:22:39,943
co-workers, friends, some
waitress that served me.

258
00:22:41,663 --> 00:22:45,383
They were crushes.
God, they were crushes.

259
00:22:49,783 --> 00:22:51,383
Never acted on any of it.

260
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,183
Never did anything.

261
00:23:02,663 --> 00:23:04,223
I was in love with him.

262
00:23:07,063 --> 00:23:09,223
I really was in love with him.

263
00:23:11,503 --> 00:23:16,423
But he chose not to stick around.

264
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:26,543
So now it's me. And I'm passing through.

265
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:30,983
And before I leave,
I'll have a good time.

266
00:23:33,543 --> 00:23:35,383
I'm just gonna have a good time.

267
00:23:47,623 --> 00:23:48,783
Time's nearly up.

268
00:23:51,903 --> 00:23:53,623
Then let's lie here.

269
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:17,409
_

270
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:45,623
Excuse me?

271
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:47,903
Have you seen Kelly?

272
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:49,823
- What's that?
- Kelly.

273
00:24:50,743 --> 00:24:52,263
I haven't seen her all night.

274
00:24:54,463 --> 00:24:56,103
You tried the Quagmire?

275
00:24:57,503 --> 00:24:59,023
What is the Quagmire?

276
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:35,543
- Whoa! Hey!
- I'm sorry!

277
00:26:37,023 --> 00:26:39,423
Yeah, I know you from somewhere.

278
00:26:41,463 --> 00:26:42,743
Tucker's.

279
00:26:43,423 --> 00:26:45,983
- Kelly's friend, huh?
- Do you know where to find her?

280
00:26:46,703 --> 00:26:49,623
- How would I know that?
- You're her friend.

281
00:26:50,983 --> 00:26:53,503
- Was a friend.
- Has she been here?

282
00:26:54,663 --> 00:26:55,663
No.

283
00:26:57,823 --> 00:27:01,223
You too, huh?

284
00:27:02,383 --> 00:27:03,383
Well...

285
00:27:06,863 --> 00:27:09,903
Hey. Try a different time.

286
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:15,183
Here in '80, the '90s, 2002 one time.

287
00:27:16,663 --> 00:27:18,343
She's worth the shot, right?

288
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:33,263

289
00:27:33,343 --> 00:27:36,903

redesigned Chrysler Cordoba.

All the luxury you expect is here.

291
00:27:40,863 --> 00:27:42,543
But so is gas mileage...

292
00:27:42,623 --> 00:27:44,103
No, no, no.

293
00:27:56,223 --> 00:27:57,303
- Hey.
- Hey.

294
00:27:58,623 --> 00:28:00,023
Golden age, right?

295
00:28:00,743 --> 00:28:02,383
- Right.
- You playing or...

296
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,583
I'm sorry, I'm looking for someone.

297
00:28:05,903 --> 00:28:07,783

I was looking for you. Where did you go?

312
00:30:04,343 --> 00:30:06,023
I like a change of music.

three... see point two.

You don't know who I am.

00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:36,463
You don't know what this means.

319
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:39,663

00:30:40,543 --> 00:30:42,703

322
00:30:47,343 --> 00:30:48,703
This is not fun.

323
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:51,503
So you don't feel bad?

324
00:30:55,023 --> 00:31:00,103
Maybe you should feel bad.
Or at least feel something.

325
00:31:45,343 --> 00:31:48,343

Mid-20s, brown hair, glasses?

Hey.

329

Please tell me you got your
pain slider set to zero.

330
00:32:22,823 --> 00:32:24,103
Yeah, I think so.

331
00:32:34,103 --> 00:32:37,183
- Okay, listen.
- How many of them are dead?

332
00:32:39,703 --> 00:32:40,903
Like what percentage?

333
00:32:44,303 --> 00:32:45,743
As in full-timers?

334
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:52,383
Eighty. Eighty-five.

335
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,143
I'm sorry.

336
00:33:05,703 --> 00:33:10,423
- I'm not gonna jump.
- I know, and I'm sorry, whatever it's...

337
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:15,063
In the time I've been
here, I said I wouldn't...

338
00:33:16,183 --> 00:33:19,703
I don't know, do feelings.

339
00:33:21,663 --> 00:33:23,263
You freaked me out.

340
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:27,823

341

totally fucking inconvenient.

for you. For wanting something...

346
00:34:14,103 --> 00:34:15,623
I'm getting married.

347
00:34:16,503 --> 00:34:17,583
Next week?

348
00:34:19,303 --> 00:34:21,503
To nice Greg?

349
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:25,383
- Sure you're going through with that?
- I have to.

350
00:34:27,623 --> 00:34:30,223
- You have
to? - Mm-hmm.

351
00:34:31,783 --> 00:34:33,943
He really is a good guy.

352
00:34:38,223 --> 00:34:40,103
I mean, my family don't approve, but...

353
00:34:41,543 --> 00:34:43,343
they can't stop us.

354
00:34:48,343 --> 00:34:51,943
I know he pities me. That pisses me off.

355
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:57,983
But that's not fair 'cause he's...

356
00:35:07,903 --> 00:35:10,463
You said you don't know
how much time there is.

357
00:35:11,863 --> 00:35:12,903
What does that mean?

358
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,383
They tell me three months.

359
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:26,263
It's spread basically everywhere.

360
00:35:28,223 --> 00:35:30,783
They said three months
before six months ago.

361
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:32,783
So, you know, what do they know?

362
00:35:36,663 --> 00:35:38,463
Doesn't even taste of anything.

363
00:35:41,783 --> 00:35:46,023
- But so you'll stay here after?
- No.

364
00:35:46,703 --> 00:35:49,823
When I'm done, I am done.

365
00:35:49,903 --> 00:35:52,143
But that's cra... I mean...

366
00:35:53,703 --> 00:35:56,463
- Why?
- Richard.

367
00:35:58,223 --> 00:35:59,223
That's...

368
00:36:02,223 --> 00:36:03,983
My husband's name was Richard.

369
00:36:07,383 --> 00:36:09,543
He died just two years ago.

370
00:36:11,023 --> 00:36:14,463
So we had the opportunity
to stay in San Junipero.

371
00:36:14,543 --> 00:36:15,543
Pass over.

372
00:36:17,703 --> 00:36:18,743
Didn't take it.

373
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,343
- Didn't want to take it.
- Why wouldn't anyone take it?

374
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:27,183
He had his viewpoint.

375
00:36:29,663 --> 00:36:34,183
There were things he believed
and things he didn't believe in,

376
00:36:34,263 --> 00:36:35,943
and this place was one of them.

377
00:36:37,903 --> 00:36:40,783
Wouldn't even visit. Take the trial run.

378
00:36:40,863 --> 00:36:42,103
Shit.

379
00:36:44,223 --> 00:36:48,623
I didn't know if I wanted
to try it but... I mean...

380
00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:54,543
Jesus, without this place, I never
would've met someone like you.

381
00:36:54,623 --> 00:36:58,583
- Yeah, you could have.
- No, I wouldn't.

382
00:36:58,663 --> 00:37:00,903
- We could have met outside all this.
- No.

383
00:37:02,343 --> 00:37:06,343
You... would not have got me at all.

384
00:37:09,503 --> 00:37:10,503
At all.

385
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:15,463
If we really met, I mean...

386
00:37:15,543 --> 00:37:18,943
If we really met, you wouldn't like me.

387
00:37:19,703 --> 00:37:20,863
Try me.

388
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:25,223
Or you'd... You wouldn't
want to spend time with me.

389
00:37:25,303 --> 00:37:27,543
- You'd come and then...
- Try me.

390
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:28,623
Why?

391
00:37:30,023 --> 00:37:32,223
Why? What's the point?

392
00:37:32,303 --> 00:37:34,423
What? Where are you? Houston?

393
00:37:35,943 --> 00:37:37,143
Carson City, Nevada.

394
00:37:38,783 --> 00:37:40,263
So come on.

395
00:37:41,023 --> 00:37:43,423
I showed you mine.

396
00:37:44,103 --> 00:37:45,303
Where are you?

397
00:37:47,743 --> 00:37:50,823
- I can just look it up.
- Santa Rosa, California.

398
00:37:50,903 --> 00:37:54,623
- That's no distance.
- I don't want you to...

399
00:37:58,383 --> 00:38:01,823
- I don't want you to see me. I'm scared...
- And I'm dying.

400
00:38:03,223 --> 00:38:05,823
Whatever you are can't scare me.

401
00:38:09,623 --> 00:38:11,143
Let me come visit.

402
00:38:12,983 --> 00:38:14,703
I want to say hi.

403
00:38:41,256 --> 00:38:42,468
_

404
00:38:57,183 --> 00:38:58,623
Here you go.

405
00:39:22,343 --> 00:39:23,143
You okay?

406
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:35,423
Please check in at
our self-service pods

407
00:39:35,503 --> 00:39:37,303
using swipe cards provided.

408
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:42,063
- You must be Kelly.
- I guess I must.

409
00:39:42,143 --> 00:39:44,383
- She's waiting for you.
- Thank you.

410
00:39:46,863 --> 00:39:49,183
Please.

411
00:39:50,103 --> 00:39:52,743
She won't be able to
physically respond in any way.

412
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,663
But she can hear you.

413
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:57,783
I'll give you some privacy.

414
00:40:31,823 --> 00:40:33,103
Hello, stupid.

415
00:40:35,703 --> 00:40:37,023
It's good to see you.

416
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:56,943
Uh... Hello. Excuse me. Is it... Kelly?

417
00:40:58,783 --> 00:40:59,823
It is.

418
00:41:01,223 --> 00:41:04,063
- I'm Greg.
- You're Greg?

419
00:41:05,303 --> 00:41:07,463
Holy shit.

420
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:11,303
Yeah, I think it's great that
you came down here in person

421
00:41:11,383 --> 00:41:12,663
before she passes over.

422
00:41:12,743 --> 00:41:14,503
Even her folks don't
come visit no more so...

423
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:15,863
She's passing over?

424
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:20,823
- When?
- Uh...

425
00:41:20,903 --> 00:41:23,263
- Let's go grab a coffee.
- Okay.

426
00:41:25,143 --> 00:41:27,943
- She didn't tell you?
- No, she did not.

427
00:41:28,823 --> 00:41:33,543
- Said she was just visiting.
- More like sampling the trial version.

428
00:41:35,703 --> 00:41:41,263
I mean, I've only known
her the past three years.

429
00:41:41,343 --> 00:41:44,303
We talk on the comm box.

430
00:41:46,943 --> 00:41:50,023
She told you how she
ended up quadriplegic?

431
00:41:50,103 --> 00:41:51,943
And how long she's been that way?

432
00:41:53,703 --> 00:41:58,063
One night, she's 21,
comes out to her folks.

433
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:00,823
They're a little uptight
about it, you might say.

434
00:42:01,903 --> 00:42:03,663
They told her they don't
want a gay daughter.

435
00:42:03,743 --> 00:42:05,823
It's not natural and so forth.

436
00:42:05,903 --> 00:42:09,943
They fight. She gets in her
car. Runs it off the road. Boom!

437
00:42:10,023 --> 00:42:13,143
- When she was 21?
- More than 40 years back.

438
00:42:13,223 --> 00:42:16,263
It's been her whole lifetime, basically.

439
00:42:16,343 --> 00:42:18,863
So the whole San Junipero system
has been a big deal for her.

440
00:42:18,943 --> 00:42:20,463
The biggest deal.

441
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:25,463
Of course now, until she
passes over, it goes permanent,

442
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,943
she's on a five-hour weekly limit.

443
00:42:28,023 --> 00:42:29,903
I guess you're the same.

444
00:42:29,983 --> 00:42:33,463
They ration it out. They
don't trust us with more.

445
00:42:33,543 --> 00:42:36,543
They say you go crazy if
you have too much, you know?

446
00:42:36,623 --> 00:42:39,503
You don't leave your seat. You
disassociate body from mind.

447
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:43,623
Like that doesn't happen in
every senior home already.

448
00:42:44,503 --> 00:42:46,943
The system's there for
therapeutic reasons,

449
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:49,983
immersive nostalgia therapy.

450
00:42:50,063 --> 00:42:52,583
Plunge you into a world of memories.

451
00:42:53,343 --> 00:42:56,663
Helps with Alzheimer's,
that's what they say.

452
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:57,983
Small mercies.

453
00:42:59,503 --> 00:43:00,623
So...

454
00:43:01,903 --> 00:43:03,663
About this marriage...

455
00:43:05,903 --> 00:43:08,983
The state's got a triple
lockdown on euthanasia cases.

456
00:43:09,063 --> 00:43:13,183
You gotta have a sign-off from the
doc, the patient, a family member.

457
00:43:13,263 --> 00:43:17,663
It's to stop folks from passing over just
because they prefer San Junipero flat out.

458
00:43:17,743 --> 00:43:19,583
Anyhow, Yorkie's family,

459
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,863
they're big-time religious,
and they will not sign.

460
00:43:22,943 --> 00:43:25,183
But a spouse can override them.

461
00:43:26,223 --> 00:43:29,383
- Hence the wedding bells.
- You got it.

462
00:43:29,463 --> 00:43:31,503
We got a pastor coming tomorrow a.m.,

463
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:34,423
and then she's scheduled
to pass tomorrow afternoon.

464
00:43:34,503 --> 00:43:37,863
"Scheduled to pass."
Let's just call it dying.

465
00:43:37,943 --> 00:43:39,943
If you can call it dying.

466
00:43:40,023 --> 00:43:43,143
Uploaded to the cloud,
sounds like heaven.

467
00:43:44,103 --> 00:43:45,303
I guess.

468
00:43:47,063 --> 00:43:48,463
You gonna wear a suit?

469
00:43:50,343 --> 00:43:52,743
The ceremony's on my coffee break.

470
00:43:54,223 --> 00:43:57,623
I never married so I just
figured, you know, what's the harm?

471
00:43:58,623 --> 00:44:00,023
You're a good man.

472
00:44:02,063 --> 00:44:03,503
It's the least I could do, right?

473
00:44:07,223 --> 00:44:10,343
Think you could hook
us up to the system now?

474
00:44:10,423 --> 00:44:13,463
Just for a little
while, before she passes?

475
00:44:13,543 --> 00:44:17,143
You can still see her afterwards.
I mean, then she's no limit.

476
00:44:17,223 --> 00:44:20,063
She's full, fat,
permanent San Juniperan.

477
00:44:20,143 --> 00:44:22,303
I know, but can you?

478
00:44:22,383 --> 00:44:24,983
Seriously, it is so tight
here that they monitor every...

479
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:27,023
I only want a moment.

480
00:44:45,223 --> 00:44:46,023
Ma'am.

481
00:44:47,463 --> 00:44:50,103
- You got five minutes
- Thank you.

482
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:04,943
Hey!

483
00:45:07,183 --> 00:45:09,303
I've never been here
during the daylight.

484
00:45:10,503 --> 00:45:11,303
It's warm.

485
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:15,023
Listen, I gotta be
quick. So I spoke to Greg.

486
00:45:15,103 --> 00:45:16,223
Oh.

487
00:45:17,703 --> 00:45:21,383
- You're passing over tomorrow?
- Yeah.

488
00:45:21,463 --> 00:45:23,183
Couple of hours after the wedding.

489
00:45:23,943 --> 00:45:28,343
So I guess I am technically
honeymooning here forever.

490
00:45:30,223 --> 00:45:32,063
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

491
00:45:34,943 --> 00:45:38,183
- I'm gonna say something crazy.
- Okay.

492
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:43,983
Wanna marry me instead?

493
00:45:45,903 --> 00:45:48,943
It's just... Greg seems great, but...

494
00:45:50,383 --> 00:45:52,583
Why not someone you've connected with?

495
00:46:01,663 --> 00:46:03,423
Is that a yes?

496
00:46:06,143 --> 00:46:07,943
...to be your lawfully wedded wife,

497
00:46:08,023 --> 00:46:13,183
to have and to hold, in
sickness and in health,

498
00:46:14,423 --> 00:46:19,063
in good times and in woe,
for richer, for poorer...

499
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:33,462
_

500
00:47:52,223 --> 00:47:53,383
Hold tight.

501
00:47:55,663 --> 00:47:57,023
There you go.

502
00:48:01,343 --> 00:48:02,343
Nearly there.

503
00:48:04,503 --> 00:48:05,583
That's it.

504
00:48:15,983 --> 00:48:17,583
Are you sure you're all right?

505
00:48:48,543 --> 00:48:49,663
Hey!

506
00:48:58,823 --> 00:49:00,383
You didn't dress up to see me?

507
00:49:00,903 --> 00:49:02,143
Oh...

508
00:49:02,223 --> 00:49:03,663
Come on!

509
00:49:05,783 --> 00:49:07,903
Better?

510
00:49:10,023 --> 00:49:11,023
Whoop!

511
00:49:14,183 --> 00:49:15,423
Oh!

512
00:49:17,183 --> 00:49:18,583
Oh! Whoo!

513
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:29,303
Looks so real.

514
00:49:32,023 --> 00:49:34,343
It feels so real!

515
00:49:41,263 --> 00:49:46,103
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I love it here!

516
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:47,183
I just love it.

517
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:50,943
- You've been here before.
- But now I live here!

518
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:53,743
Be with me.

519
00:49:55,183 --> 00:49:58,703
- I'm with you now.
- That's not what I mean.

520
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:01,983
Pass over.

521
00:50:03,143 --> 00:50:06,263
- When it's your time.
- Yorkie.

522
00:50:06,343 --> 00:50:09,703
- Stay here with me.
- Can we just enjoy tonight?

523
00:50:09,783 --> 00:50:11,783
It's almost midnight.

524
00:50:11,863 --> 00:50:13,223
In ten minutes, you're out of here.

525
00:50:13,303 --> 00:50:14,943
Then I gotta wait a
week to see you again.

526
00:50:15,023 --> 00:50:18,143
- You know I'm just a visitor.
- What, a couple of months, then what?

527
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,943
- We're not discussing this.
- Then you're gone.

528
00:50:21,023 --> 00:50:24,863
- Just gone. You could have forever.
- Forever?

529
00:50:24,943 --> 00:50:28,183
- Who can even make sense of forever?
- However long you want then.

530
00:50:28,263 --> 00:50:30,863
I mean, you can remove
yourself like that.

531
00:50:30,943 --> 00:50:32,743
It's not a trap.

532
00:50:32,823 --> 00:50:36,223
I mean, look at it! Jesus! Touch it!

533
00:50:36,303 --> 00:50:38,623
- I'm going.
- Hey! Oh. Hey.

534
00:50:40,503 --> 00:50:41,503
It's real.

535
00:50:42,663 --> 00:50:45,063
This is real.

536
00:50:46,663 --> 00:50:48,303
And this.

537
00:50:49,823 --> 00:50:51,343
- Hmm?
- Come on.

538
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,263
You know that was just a gesture.

539
00:50:55,223 --> 00:50:58,943
- You married me.
- To help you pass over.

540
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:03,903
- As a... kindness.
- It's not so kind to leave.

541
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,943
Okay, look, look, I'm sorry, I just...

542
00:51:12,943 --> 00:51:14,743
I got this chance.

543
00:51:16,503 --> 00:51:19,623
We got this chance. I
wanna share it with you.

544
00:51:22,023 --> 00:51:24,663
I said I made my choice.

545
00:51:24,743 --> 00:51:27,863
What is it? You feel bad
because your husband isn't here?

546
00:51:28,663 --> 00:51:31,543
- Because that was his choice.
- Don't.

547
00:51:31,623 --> 00:51:34,303
He chose not to stay here.
It's like he left you.

548
00:51:35,263 --> 00:51:38,343
You know, he could have stayed,
but he chose to leave you.

549
00:51:38,423 --> 00:51:40,703
- You don't know what you're saying.
- You should be mad at him.

550
00:51:40,783 --> 00:51:42,823
- Not whipping yourself with guilt.
- Get off me.

551
00:51:42,903 --> 00:51:46,783
You can't see it! But what he
did, it was selfish actually!

552
00:51:51,463 --> 00:51:52,903
Forty-nine years...

553
00:51:55,063 --> 00:52:00,343
I was with him for 49 years.

554
00:52:01,383 --> 00:52:03,943
You can't begin to imagine.

555
00:52:05,103 --> 00:52:06,663
You can't know...

556
00:52:08,503 --> 00:52:12,063
the bond, the commitment, the boredom,

557
00:52:12,143 --> 00:52:14,503
the yearning, the
laughter, the love of it.

558
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:17,143
The fucking love. You just cannot know!

559
00:52:19,143 --> 00:52:21,263
Everything we sacrificed.

560
00:52:22,703 --> 00:52:26,223
The years I gave him.
The years he gave me.

561
00:52:26,303 --> 00:52:27,663
Did you think to ask?

562
00:52:29,623 --> 00:52:32,223
Did it occur to you to ask?

563
00:52:34,783 --> 00:52:36,183
We had a daughter.

564
00:52:38,903 --> 00:52:40,143
Alison.

565
00:52:42,063 --> 00:52:44,943
Always difficult, always beautiful.

566
00:52:45,023 --> 00:52:47,743
Died at 39 years old, bless her heart.

567
00:52:47,823 --> 00:52:50,903
And Richard and I, we felt
that heartbreak as one.

568
00:52:52,343 --> 00:52:55,103
You think you're the only person
ever suffered, go fuck yourself.

569
00:52:55,183 --> 00:52:57,383
- Well, I didn't know...
- Didn't think to.

570
00:52:58,943 --> 00:53:01,463
You know, when he was
dying, Richard said to me

571
00:53:01,543 --> 00:53:05,183
when they offered him this,
to pass over, pass through,

572
00:53:05,263 --> 00:53:07,943
spend eternity in this fucking
graveyard you're so in love with,

573
00:53:08,023 --> 00:53:13,703
he said, "How can I? When
she missed out, how can I?"

574
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,183
And so he went.

575
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:20,583
And I wish I could
believe he's with her now,

576
00:53:20,663 --> 00:53:22,303
that they're together, but I don't.

577
00:53:23,263 --> 00:53:26,223
I believe they're nowhere.
Just like you said.

578
00:53:26,823 --> 00:53:30,903
Gone. No, I pitied you, and
that's the truth. I pitied you.

579
00:53:30,983 --> 00:53:32,383
Now you give me some sales pitch

580
00:53:32,463 --> 00:53:34,343
about how fucking
peachy forever could be.

581
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:35,463
I'm sorry.

582
00:53:35,543 --> 00:53:37,743
You wanna spend forever
somewhere nothing matters?

583
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:40,623
End up like Wes?

584
00:53:40,703 --> 00:53:43,823
All those lost fucks at the Quagmire

585
00:53:43,903 --> 00:53:45,983
trying anything to feel
something, go ahead.

586
00:53:47,263 --> 00:53:49,983
But I'm out. I'm gone.

587
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:56,943
Kelly, I'm sorry. Kelly!

588
00:54:28,614 --> 00:54:29,425
_

589
00:56:11,503 --> 00:56:12,983
Hey, Kelly.

590
00:56:14,823 --> 00:56:17,983
- You all right?
- Yeah, I am fine.

591
00:57:14,863 --> 00:57:17,823
- Well, okay then.
- Huh?

592
00:57:22,263 --> 00:57:23,263
Kelly?

593
00:57:24,343 --> 00:57:26,503
All things considered...

594
00:57:28,543 --> 00:57:29,983
I guess I'm ready.

595
00:57:32,503 --> 00:57:33,623

596
00:57:36,903 --> 00:57:38,903
