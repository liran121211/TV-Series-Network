00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:46,967
Kenny? Big spillage on table four. Sorry.

4
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:58,807
Okay. All right.

5
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,008
Excuse me.

6
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:04,724
Someone forgot this.

7
00:02:04,727 --> 00:02:06,167
Oh, thank you!

8
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:08,887
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

9
00:02:09,447 --> 00:02:12,047
- It's all right.
- She forgets everything. Thanks again.

10
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:23,447
She was some yoga teacher,
proper bendy. Look. Look.

11
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:29,404
Jesus! Fuck! What, she
sent that to you, did she?

12
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:30,567
Double naughty.

13
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:34,727
Jog on.

14
00:03:04,607 --> 00:03:06,887
Linds!

15
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:10,012
Linds, where's my laptop?

16
00:03:12,847 --> 00:03:15,124
- Don't be a bell end!
- Use your own.

17
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:18,644
- Mine's bust. Yours has gone all frozen.
- What did you do?

18
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:20,804
- I was trying to put on this film thing.
- What film thing?

19
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:23,804
Don't know. Some programme
lets you watch free films.

20
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:26,502
While I was trying to put it on,
then it locked up.

21
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:29,564
- Look, it's not my fault.
- Don't take it again. It's not yours.

22
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:32,925
- Oh, fix mine when you've done that.
- "Fix mine when you've done that."

- Whatever.

27
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:41,821
Did you draw that yourself, Kenny?

28
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,261
Thanks, Kenny. See you tomorrow.

29
00:04:53,804 --> 00:04:55,076
Bye.

30
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:58,301
- Bye, Kenny.
- Bye, Kenny, I'll see you tomorrow.

31
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:04,741
You're mental.

32
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:11,461
- You're mental.
- You're a thief.

33
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:30,141
Love? Kenny? What do you think?

34
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:33,698
- I'm still not used to the colour.
- It's nice.

35
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:34,861
Yeah?

36
00:05:35,821 --> 00:05:38,101
Do me a favour and prison-guard
your sister, will you?

37
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:41,858
I won't be late. Probably.

38
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:48,698
Oh, my God! He's outside.
There's a lasagna thing in the freezer.

39
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:49,901
I love you.

Ha!

- Kenny?
- Feeling really sick.

70
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:35,001
- You've only just got here.
- I know but think I might throw up.

71
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:38,961
Okay, just next time can you...?

72
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:50,081
Whoa! Easy, knobber.

Come on.

77
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:49,709
- It's fragile.
- What is it?

78
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:56,829
They told me to do that.

79
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:05,612
Is that it? What do I do now?

80
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:12,055
I can't really help you.

81
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:16,852
What do I have to do?

82
00:15:16,855 --> 00:15:19,535
Just whatever they say and once
you've done that, you're out.

83
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:21,295
They let you off.

Hello?

88
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:40,495
Del... Delivery.

89
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:43,375
Wrong room.

90
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:47,255
They said 121.

91
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:55,132
No, there's no delivery here.

92
00:17:55,135 --> 00:17:57,575
- But they said...
- I haven't ordered anything.

93
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:07,015
It's a cake.

94
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:11,532
- What cake?
- I don't know. I think it's a sponge.

95
00:18:11,535 --> 00:18:14,932
I didn't order a cake so
just take it back to the bakery

96
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:16,972
- and tell them they got it wrong.
- Look, if I...

97
00:18:16,975 --> 00:18:21,335
I don't want the cake.
So go away or I call the front desk.

98
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,249

99
00:18:34,592 --> 00:18:36,414

100
00:18:44,815 --> 00:18:47,172
I will kick that
cake up your fucking arse.

101
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:49,175
M-Mindy sent me.

102
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:03,612
- What is this? Where's Mindy?
- I was just told to give this to you.

103
00:19:03,615 --> 00:19:05,492
- Mindy told you?
- No.

104
00:19:05,495 --> 00:19:07,812
- You said "Mindy."
- That's what they told me to say.

105
00:19:13,975 --> 00:19:15,092
Get inside.

106
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:21,532
So what are you saying?
Are you saying Mindy ordered the cake?

107
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:25,892
No, uh, I don't know.
It... they... it was them.

108
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:28,412
Them? They? Who the
fuck are you on about?

109
00:19:28,415 --> 00:19:30,692
- The people.
- What fucking people?

110
00:19:30,695 --> 00:19:32,932
The phone people.
The people on the phone.

111
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:36,372
They told me to bring the cake,
and they're leaving texts on my phone,

112
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,052
- and then I do what they say.
- Whoa, whoa. Slow down.

113
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:40,812
Just breathe through your nose.

114
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:44,532
Through your nose. Okay?

115
00:19:44,535 --> 00:19:49,255
Good. Now, just show me what
they said. On your phone.

116
00:19:50,095 --> 00:19:54,055
- Show me the text.
- Okay, well, um... This.

117
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:58,055
- I should...
- Shut up. Just let me.

118
00:20:02,215 --> 00:20:03,535
What the fuck is this?

119
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:06,855
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.

120
00:20:08,095 --> 00:20:11,692
- Who are you?
- I'm not them.

121
00:20:11,695 --> 00:20:15,092
They send me messages,
and I do what they say.

122
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:17,495
Why? Why would you do that?

123
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:41,015
Is it them?

124
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:05,860
_

125
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,015
_

126
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,269
_

127
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:40,535
- They said I had to do that.
- Jesus Christ!

128
00:21:51,055 --> 00:21:52,295
Okay, okay.

129
00:21:53,735 --> 00:21:57,532
They're saying they just need
us to follow their instructions,

130
00:21:57,535 --> 00:21:59,655
and everything will be okay. Okay?

131
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,455
Shit!

132
00:22:04,935 --> 00:22:07,935
They're saying we have to do it together.

133
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:12,095
- What do we have to do?
- Just take the cake somewhere.

134
00:22:12,655 --> 00:22:16,092
They sent me an address.
A map coordinate thing.

135
00:22:16,095 --> 00:22:19,575
- And there's a car we need to get.
- A car? What sort of car?

136
00:22:20,895 --> 00:22:24,332
I don't know what sort of car.
They said it's in the car park outside.

137
00:22:24,335 --> 00:22:26,695
They sent me a licence plate.
That's all I know.

138
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,415
Why both of us?

139
00:22:30,895 --> 00:22:32,255
I don't know!

140
00:22:33,535 --> 00:22:35,932
Just let me deal with my
fucking shoe, please.

141
00:22:39,198 --> 00:22:40,458
_

142
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:41,563
What have they said?

143
00:22:43,055 --> 00:22:46,095
They say, "Go with him.
Take the package."

144
00:22:48,855 --> 00:22:50,048
Okay.

145
00:23:12,415 --> 00:23:14,372
I'm getting fucking
number blindness here.

146
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,495
That's it.

147
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:23,703
All right. They said the
keys are on the back. Okay.

148
00:23:31,135 --> 00:23:33,612
Look, maybe you better
drive. Do you drive?

149
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:37,132
- I mean, I had a drink back there.
- I can't. I can... I can drive.

150
00:23:37,135 --> 00:23:38,612
I'm still learning.
Haven't passed my test yet.

151
00:23:38,615 --> 00:23:41,735
All right. Uh... You're navigating.

152
00:23:42,335 --> 00:23:44,212
Okay, you've got a sat nav on your phone?

153
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:45,375
Yep.

154
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:48,852
Here it is. Punch that in.

155
00:23:48,855 --> 00:23:52,292
It's a street somewhere out of town.
Sort of High Wycombe-ish.

156
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:55,655
They said we got to be there by two.
It's gonna be tight.

157
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:11,135
So I'm guessing they got some shit on
you that they're threatening to put out?

158
00:24:18,695 --> 00:24:19,695
With me, it's...

159
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,615
You saw the room, fucking lacy knickers.

160
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:28,212
I was waiting for a prostitute.

161
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:30,575
Escort, hooker, whatever
they call them now.

162
00:24:31,615 --> 00:24:33,855
I got a family, which is great.

163
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:37,495
You get bored.

164
00:24:38,855 --> 00:24:40,815
I mean, when I was young, I used to like...

165
00:24:42,255 --> 00:24:45,852
I can't fucking justify it.
I just wanted to fuck a 20-something.

166
00:24:45,855 --> 00:24:47,892
For old times' sake, I don't know.

167
00:24:47,895 --> 00:24:52,535
I joined this website. I was curious.
Just wanted to see what was on there.

168
00:24:53,095 --> 00:24:55,855
I got talking to Mindy,
who I thought was Mindy.

169
00:24:57,055 --> 00:25:01,052
I mean, she sent me pictures.
I sent some back.

170
00:25:01,055 --> 00:25:03,212
Phone photos. Grabbing my cock.

171
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:05,812
You name it.
They got the whole fucking thing.

172
00:25:05,815 --> 00:25:09,452
But not just pictures, chat messages.
All the arrangements, where and when.

173
00:25:09,455 --> 00:25:11,932
Me haggling over the price
and they say they got it all.

174
00:25:11,935 --> 00:25:14,412
Sucked up the whole hard
drive like an audit.

175
00:25:14,415 --> 00:25:19,172
Fucking twat. What a fucking idiot!

176
00:25:19,175 --> 00:25:22,332
If that shit gets out,
that's my wife out the door.

177
00:25:22,335 --> 00:25:24,252
Then there's the kids, she'll take them.

178
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:27,452
Oh, no, not a doubt in my mind
she'd take them and she'd win.

179
00:25:27,455 --> 00:25:29,092
Custody, she'd win.

180
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:32,812
And I'm not losing my kids.
I tell you that right now.

181
00:25:32,815 --> 00:25:35,412
No way! Absolutely fucking no!

182
00:25:40,855 --> 00:25:42,735
They filmed me.

183
00:25:44,615 --> 00:25:47,215
- Filmed you...
- Through my computer camera.

184
00:25:48,175 --> 00:25:52,615
- What, like, filmed you?
- Yeah, like, you know, doing it.

185
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:58,015
- Like sex?
- No. Like, you... you know.

186
00:25:58,855 --> 00:26:02,015
Jerking off. Jerking off
to porn or something?

187
00:26:02,935 --> 00:26:04,295
Well, everyone does that.

188
00:26:05,175 --> 00:26:08,172
- The fucking pope probably does that.
- They're gonna put it everywhere.

189
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:09,932
Like they're gonna send it to everyone.

190
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:11,812
- Oh, shit the fuck!
- What? What?

191
00:26:11,815 --> 00:26:14,612
- How long's that light been on?
- What light?

192
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:16,895
Whoever's car this is,
they left it fucking empty.

193
00:26:25,735 --> 00:26:27,097
I won't be a minute.

194
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:32,295
Unleaded. Unleaded.

195
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:35,899
Oh, bugger!

196
00:26:40,215 --> 00:26:42,895
Listen, you pay, yeah? It'll save time.

197
00:26:43,615 --> 00:26:44,535
Have you got any money?

198
00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:50,772
Okay, Visa card PIN number 3109.
Say that back to me.

199
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,812
- Visa card...
- Just the number!

200
00:26:52,815 --> 00:26:55,135
- Uh... 3109.
- Okay, go!

201
00:26:59,055 --> 00:27:00,335
Pump four!

202
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:25,255
- What's your pump number?
- Four.

203
00:27:26,535 --> 00:27:28,375
- You want some chocolate?
- No.

204
00:27:28,935 --> 00:27:31,095
- It's two for one this week.
- I'm okay.

205
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:34,255
31.89.

206
00:27:38,495 --> 00:27:39,895
Pop your PIN in.

207
00:28:06,255 --> 00:28:08,932
- If you're sure you don't mind?
- No, no, of course not.

208
00:28:08,935 --> 00:28:13,652
- I'll get on to that. Make some calls.
- Brilliant! It's next Wednesday.

209
00:28:13,655 --> 00:28:16,732
- Okay.
- Keep it non-dairy just to be safe.

210
00:28:16,735 --> 00:28:17,735
Okay.

211
00:28:22,015 --> 00:28:23,375
This is, uh...

212
00:28:25,295 --> 00:28:27,172
my nephew.

213
00:28:27,175 --> 00:28:28,615
Nice to meet you.

214
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:32,055
- Kenny.
- Kenny. I'm Karen.

215
00:28:33,215 --> 00:28:35,295
We're both Ks.

216
00:28:36,735 --> 00:28:40,412
I'm head of the PTA at Theo and
Cassie's school, for my sins.

217
00:28:40,415 --> 00:28:44,815
Just roped poor Hector into sorting
out the catering for the quiz night.

218
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,532
Been the usual balls up.

219
00:28:46,535 --> 00:28:48,732
Listen, we better get this
guy to the station.

220
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:51,372
His train's... So we better go.

221
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:54,172
- Cansroad Station?
- Yeah.

222
00:28:54,175 --> 00:28:56,372
Oh, couldn't drop me at the
end of my road, could you?

223
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:57,775
It's on the way. Mayer Street?

224
00:28:58,335 --> 00:29:00,332
It's the bus otherwise and that
goes all the way around the common.

225
00:29:00,335 --> 00:29:03,732
- We're in a bit of a rush, actually.
- Well, it's no detour. It's en route.

226
00:29:03,735 --> 00:29:07,495
I'll hop out. Hardly need
to slow down. Yeah?

227
00:29:09,975 --> 00:29:13,455
- Yep. Sure. Let's go.
- Brilliant. Thanks!

228
00:29:14,015 --> 00:29:15,175
I'll just get in the back.

229
00:29:18,975 --> 00:29:21,092
Oh, don't want to squash your box.

230
00:29:21,095 --> 00:29:23,015
- What's that? Present?
- It's a cake.

231
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,895
- It's just a... it's a cake for Penny.
- Oh, lucky her.

232
00:29:31,575 --> 00:29:33,052
So how is Penny?

233
00:29:33,055 --> 00:29:36,215
Haven't seen her since...
must have been sports day.

234
00:29:37,215 --> 00:29:38,652
She's good.

235
00:29:38,655 --> 00:29:41,932
- She still planning to get back to work?
- Yeah. Yep.

236
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,990
_

237
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:48,655
- I mean, how old's Theo now?
- Uh... He's seven.

238
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,310
_

239
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:54,492
He was so funny in the play.
That big top hat on.

240
00:29:54,495 --> 00:29:56,175
Yeah, he had a good time.

241
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,310
_

242
00:29:58,335 --> 00:30:00,652
Oh, Anna's
having a sleepover.

243
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:03,092
Cassie's probably
already told you about it.

244
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:06,972
Six nine-year-olds in the house.
I must be mad!

245
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,021
_

246
00:30:14,295 --> 00:30:15,855
So, Kenny, where you heading back to?

247
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:19,935
- Sorry. What?
- Are you going home or...?

248
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:22,615
- Uh...
- Train. Birmingham.

249
00:30:23,215 --> 00:30:24,772
Yeah. Uh...

250
00:30:24,775 --> 00:30:28,892
- Yeah, I-I live in Birmingham.
- Oh, my husband's from Birmingham.

251
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:30,492
- What part are you?
- South.

252
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,055
South.

253
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:35,772
- Mainly.
- Right.

254
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:37,932
_

255
00:30:37,935 --> 00:30:39,612
Have you always lived there?
'Cos you don't sound...

256
00:30:39,615 --> 00:30:41,812
I don't have the accent, no.
Everyone says that...

257
00:30:41,815 --> 00:30:44,292
That... I don't have the accent.

258
00:30:46,215 --> 00:30:49,652
Didn't grow up there though.
I grew up somewhere else.

259
00:30:49,655 --> 00:30:52,732
Like London. I grew up in London.

260
00:30:52,735 --> 00:30:53,895
Okay.

261
00:30:54,495 --> 00:30:58,772
And is your mum and dad on
Hector's side or Penny's?

262
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:09,172
Someone crossing! Crossing!

263
00:31:14,535 --> 00:31:17,295
Sorry about that! Can't miss his train.

264
00:31:31,535 --> 00:31:33,935
This is me.

265
00:31:38,215 --> 00:31:40,852
Great to meet you, Kenny.
Give my best to Penny, won't you?

266
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:43,492
- Yes, of course.
- Bye, then.

267
00:31:43,495 --> 00:31:45,055
- Bye, Karen.
- Bye.

268
00:32:00,175 --> 00:32:01,455
We're gonna make it, okay?

269
00:32:03,135 --> 00:32:04,175
It's this junction.

270
00:32:05,135 --> 00:32:06,935
- What? This one?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

271
00:32:24,655 --> 00:32:25,829
You sure this is it?

272
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:30,775
"Look in the cake."

273
00:32:35,135 --> 00:32:36,455
Let's look in the cake.

274
00:32:45,615 --> 00:32:47,015
Look in the cake.

275
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:51,895
In the cake, I suppose.

276
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:05,215
I got something.

277
00:33:13,735 --> 00:33:15,258
What the fuck?

278
00:33:23,775 --> 00:33:25,055
Oh, my God.

279
00:33:33,935 --> 00:33:35,852
"Five minutes to decide."

280
00:33:35,855 --> 00:33:37,692
Decide what?

281
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:44,015
- "Who is driver?"
- "Who is robber?"

282
00:33:53,109 --> 00:33:56,292
_

283
00:33:57,255 --> 00:33:59,212
Oh, no. No.

284
00:33:59,215 --> 00:34:02,055
- W-w-we can't. We...
- I'm driver.

285
00:34:04,495 --> 00:34:06,415
You said you can't drive. I'm driver.

286
00:34:07,175 --> 00:34:09,215
I'll be right here with
the engine running.

287
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:11,932
We... We can't. We...

288
00:34:11,935 --> 00:34:14,212
Then how else are we gonna
deal with this, Kenny?

289
00:34:14,215 --> 00:34:15,692
- I'm not...
- Listen to me.

290
00:34:15,695 --> 00:34:17,735
- I'm not...
- Shut up and listen!

291
00:34:19,295 --> 00:34:22,332
Hat and sunglasses.
No one's going to ID you.

292
00:34:22,335 --> 00:34:24,852
You could be Kevin fucking Bacon.
That's point one.

293
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:29,572
Shut up!
Point two, in a robbery, staff are trained.

294
00:34:29,575 --> 00:34:30,612
I am not...

295
00:34:30,615 --> 00:34:33,292
They are trained to hand over the cash.

296
00:34:33,295 --> 00:34:37,052
No argument. I saw it in a documentary.
No resistance. It looked easy.

297
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:38,212
It's not easy.

298
00:34:38,215 --> 00:34:43,215
I know it isn't easy, but what the
fuck else are we gonna do? Hey?

299
00:34:45,095 --> 00:34:48,212
This gets out, I will lose my kids.

300
00:34:48,215 --> 00:34:51,012
And I swear to God,
I will stand in the kitchen

301
00:34:51,015 --> 00:34:54,055
and put a fucking bread knife
through my throat if that happens.

302
00:34:54,615 --> 00:34:58,855
- I only looked at pictures and...
- And beat one off on camera?

303
00:35:00,135 --> 00:35:01,535
That's what they got, yeah?

304
00:35:02,775 --> 00:35:07,535
Your hot little face, blurred fist,
dick burping fucking spunk everywhere?

305
00:35:08,415 --> 00:35:12,652
Your mum's gonna love that on Facebook,
Twitter, Insta-fucking-whatever.

306
00:35:12,655 --> 00:35:15,175
And her friends. All eyes
on you, giving it that.

307
00:35:16,495 --> 00:35:19,572
Toss in the cunts at work,
calling you Spurty McGoo.

308
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:22,452
Laughing at your come face,
making it their desktop wallpaper.

309
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:24,372
It's not just weeks.
We're talking years here.

310
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:27,212
Pictures hang about on Google
like a gypsy fucking curse.

311
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:29,692
There's no cure for the Internet.
It would never go away.

312
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:32,735
It'd be glued to your name,
a fucking stain on you.

313
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:35,132
I'd hang myself if that was me.

314
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,295
Crack my fucking neck at
the first opportunity.

315
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:48,772
They just want the money,
so go in there and do it.

316
00:35:48,775 --> 00:35:52,532
- You'll drive away.
- I am not gonna drive away.

317
00:35:52,535 --> 00:35:54,855
I'm gonna be sat here
with the engine running.

318
00:35:56,495 --> 00:35:57,812
I can't. I can't.

319
00:35:57,815 --> 00:36:01,015
- You can. You can.
- I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't.

320
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:03,252
- You can.
- I can't.

321
00:36:03,255 --> 00:36:05,575
We don't have much time, Kenny.

322
00:36:09,215 --> 00:36:12,452
- It's not real. This is not real.
- You can do this.

323
00:36:14,735 --> 00:36:16,572
Keep it together. Please hold it together.

324
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:20,095
- Shut up, shut up, shut up! Shut up!
- Okay.

325
00:36:25,455 --> 00:36:26,255
Have you got a bag?

326
00:36:28,095 --> 00:36:31,015
Glasses. Breathe through your nose.

327
00:37:22,015 --> 00:37:24,015
Give me money.

328
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:33,972
Just give me money!

329
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:39,452
- Yes. Okay.
- Lots of it. I need lots of it.

330
00:37:39,455 --> 00:37:41,495
Sh-should I use your bag?

331
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:46,415
Take it.

332
00:37:57,695 --> 00:38:02,095
I'm going to pass this
back to you now. Is that okay?

333
00:38:37,455 --> 00:38:39,972
There was some bloke standing
there on his phone freaking me out.

334
00:38:39,975 --> 00:38:41,655
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

335
00:38:51,055 --> 00:38:52,532
Go faster.

336
00:38:52,535 --> 00:38:55,415
Speed limit's 40. Wanna
get stopped for speeding now?

337
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:05,895
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck!

338
00:39:18,695 --> 00:39:20,052
That's a siren.

339
00:39:20,055 --> 00:39:22,655
Shh! Shush.

340
00:39:28,295 --> 00:39:30,455
- Let's go!
- Shut up.

341
00:39:33,815 --> 00:39:35,335
Wait, wait.

342
00:39:36,655 --> 00:39:37,815
Come on.

343
00:39:39,055 --> 00:39:40,255
Come on.

344
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:42,615
Okay.

345
00:40:11,455 --> 00:40:12,775
We're okay.

346
00:40:13,335 --> 00:40:16,815
We should text them, no?
Tell them we got the money.

347
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:26,215
- They say we got to take it somewhere.
- Where?

348
00:40:45,055 --> 00:40:46,415
This is it.

349
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:48,415
Yeah.

350
00:40:52,615 --> 00:40:53,855
Here we go.

351
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:56,529
"Final instruction."

352
00:40:58,215 --> 00:40:59,735
"Take car away and destroy."

353
00:41:02,095 --> 00:41:04,135
Destroy the car.

354
00:41:05,135 --> 00:41:06,255
"Just you alone."

355
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:12,015
Why just you?

356
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:15,244
_

357
00:41:15,316 --> 00:41:16,966
_

358
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:23,135
I got to take the money
somewhere over there.

359
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:28,055
Why? Why have I got to do it?

360
00:41:29,575 --> 00:41:31,375
Fuck knows.

361
00:41:32,382 --> 00:41:33,949
_

362
00:41:33,975 --> 00:41:35,095
So...

363
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:39,655
You better go, yeah?

364
00:41:43,455 --> 00:41:46,015
Hey, you got this far, haven't you?

365
00:41:47,655 --> 00:41:51,455
Just drop it off. That's it.

366
00:41:52,455 --> 00:41:53,665
You'll be all right.

367
00:42:04,295 --> 00:42:10,412
Hey, listen, Kenny. Look.
I'm sorry about... just back there.

368
00:42:10,415 --> 00:42:13,175
Shouting at you. Calling you stuff.

369
00:42:14,255 --> 00:42:18,135
I'm an all right bloke really.
I swear I am, when it's...

370
00:42:19,735 --> 00:42:21,255
When stuff's normal.

371
00:42:23,855 --> 00:42:25,335
You take care, yeah?

372
00:44:27,544 --> 00:44:28,784
Yeah, yeah. Hang on, hang on.

373
00:44:39,175 --> 00:44:41,215
They told me I had to
set this thing off first.

374
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:01,615
Okay.

375
00:45:03,455 --> 00:45:04,615
You got the prize money?

376
00:45:05,895 --> 00:45:09,975
- Prize money?
- You know, for the... fight?

377
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,375
How is there a fight?

378
00:45:13,935 --> 00:45:16,135
- They didn't tell you?
- No.

379
00:45:20,215 --> 00:45:21,735
We've got to fight...

380
00:45:23,615 --> 00:45:25,615
...or else they post
everything they've got on us.

381
00:45:26,695 --> 00:45:28,255
Winner takes the money.

382
00:45:32,215 --> 00:45:33,575
We've got to do it.

383
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:37,052
I mean...

384
00:45:37,055 --> 00:45:38,455
They're watching.

385
00:45:42,415 --> 00:45:46,655
What sort of fight?
How do we know when it's over?

386
00:45:48,255 --> 00:45:50,015
How... How do we know who's won?

387
00:45:56,135 --> 00:46:02,092
I don't know about you,
but my life's over if this gets out.

388
00:46:04,735 --> 00:46:06,015
Fucking over.

389
00:46:11,615 --> 00:46:12,975
What they get you for?

390
00:46:14,135 --> 00:46:15,972
I just looked at some photos.

391
00:46:15,975 --> 00:46:18,652
That's all.
I just looked at one or two photos.

392
00:46:18,655 --> 00:46:21,052
Yeah.

393
00:46:21,055 --> 00:46:23,615
Yeah, yeah, I just
looked at pictures too.

394
00:46:26,855 --> 00:46:30,375
How young were they? In the pictures?

395
00:46:32,775 --> 00:46:34,735
How young?

396
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,775
Yeah.

397
00:46:42,255 --> 00:46:43,655
Well, me too.

398
00:47:01,895 --> 00:47:05,055
Look, mate. Don't. Please.

399
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:07,895
Please.

400
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:09,895
