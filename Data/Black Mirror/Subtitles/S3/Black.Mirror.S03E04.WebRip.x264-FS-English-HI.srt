Yeah! [laughs]

00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,190
Hey.

358
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,390
Hey. No, you...

359
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,510
Wait a minute.

360
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,190
Why are you here?

361
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,430
I was looking for you.
Where did you go?

362
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,190
I like a change of music.

363
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,750
How the hell is this your era?

364
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,950
- You hid from me.
- One, I did not.

365
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:16,750
Two, I owe you zero.
And three... see point two.

366
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:26,790
It's not about who owes who.
It's about manners.

367
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,070
You don't know who I am.

368
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,630
You don't know what this means.

369
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,830
This means fun.

370
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,870
Or it should. And this...

371
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,190
This is not fun, okay?

372
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,870
This is not fun.

373
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,670
So you don't feel bad?

374
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:56,270
Maybe you should feel bad.
Or at least feel something.

375

Uh...

380
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,310
Oh, jeez.

381
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,270
Hey.

382
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,110
Please tell me
you got your pain slider set to zero.

383
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,270
Yeah, I think so.

384
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:33,350
- Okay, listen.
- How many of them are dead?

385
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,070
Like what percentage?

386
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,910
As in full-timers?

387
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:48,550
[Kelly] Eighty. Eighty-five.

388
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,310
I'm sorry.

389
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:06,590
- I'm not gonna jump.
- I know, and I'm sorry, whatever it's...

390
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,230
In the time I've been here,
I said I wouldn't...

391
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,870
I don't know, do feelings.

392
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,430
You freaked me out.

393
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,990
I don't want to like anyone.

394
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:30,110
So you've been just...
totally fucking inconvenient.

395
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,550
It's that...

396
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,630
I don't know how long there is.

397
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:44,430
And I can't. I wasn't prepared for you.
For wanting something...

398
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,590
[sighs] Next week it is.

399
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,790
I'm getting married.

400
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,750
Next week?

401
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,670
- To nice Greg?
- [laughs]

402
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,550
- Sure you're going through with that?
- I have to.

403
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,390
- You have to?
- Mm-hmm.

404
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:30,110
He really is a good guy.

405
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,270
I mean, my family don't approve, but...

406
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,510
they can't stop us.

407
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:48,110
I know he pities me. That pisses me off.

408
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:54,150
- But that's not fair 'cause he's...
- [shushes]

409
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,630
You said you don't know
how much time there is.

410
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,070
What does that mean?

411
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,550
They tell me three months.

412
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,430
It's spread basically everywhere.

413
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,950
They said three months before
six months ago.

414
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,950
So, you know, what do they know?

415
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,630
Doesn't even taste of anything.

416
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:42,190
- But so you'll stay here after?
- No.

417
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,990
When I'm done, I am done.

418
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,310
But that's cra... I mean...

419
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,630
- Why?
- Richard.

420
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,390
That's...

421
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,150
My husband's name was Richard.

422
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,710
He died just two years ago.

423
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:10,630
So we had the opportunity
to stay in San Junipero.

424
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,710
Pass over.

425
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:14,910
Didn't take it.

426
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,510
- Didn't want to take it.
- Why wouldn't anyone take it?

427
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,350
He had his viewpoint.

428
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:30,350
There were things he believed
and things he didn't believe in,

429
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,110
and this place was one of them.

430
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,950
Wouldn't even visit. Take the trial run.

431
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,270
Shit.

432
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:44,790
I didn't know if I wanted to try it
but... I mean...

433
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:50,710
Jesus, without this place,
I never would've met someone like you.

434
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:54,750
- Yeah, you could have.
- No, I wouldn't.

435
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,070
- We could have met outside all this.
- No.

436
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,510
You... would not have got me at all.

437
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,670
At all.

438
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:11,630
If we really met, I mean...

439
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:15,110
If we <i>really</i> met, you wouldn't like me.

440
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,030
Try me.

441
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,390
Or you'd...
You wouldn't want to spend time with me.

442
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,710
- You'd come and then...
- Try me.

443
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,790
Why?

444
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,390
Why? What's the point?

445
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,590
What? Where are you? Houston?

446
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,310
Carson City, Nevada.

447
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,430
So come on.

448
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,590
I showed you mine.

449
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,470
Where are you?

450
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,990
- I can just look it up.
- Santa Rosa, California.

451
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,790
- That's no distance.
- I don't want you to...

452
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:57,990
- I don't want you to see me. I'm scared...
- And I'm dying.

453
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,990
Whatever you are can't scare me.

454
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,310
Let me come visit.

455
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,870
I want to say hi.

456
00:38:37,423 --> 00:38:38,635
_

457
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,790
Here you go.

458
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,310
You okay?

459
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,590
[man over loudspeaker]

461
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,230
- You must be Kelly.
- I guess I must.

462
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,550
- She's waiting for you.
- Thank you.

463
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,350
- Please.
- [beeps]

464
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,910
She won't be able
to physically respond in any way.

465
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,830
But she can hear you.

466
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,950
I'll give you some privacy.

467
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,270
[whispers] Hello, stupid.

468
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,190
It's good to see you.

469
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:53,110
Uh... Hello. Excuse me. Is it... Kelly?

470
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:55,990
It is.

471
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:00,230
- I'm Greg.
- You're Greg?

472
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,630
- Holy shit.
- [laughs]

473
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:07,470
Yeah, I think it's great
that you came down here in person

474
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,830
before she passes over.

475
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,670
Even her folks
don't come visit no more so...

476
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,030
She's passing over?

477
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,990
- When?
- Uh...

478
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,430
- Let's go grab a coffee.
- Okay.

479
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,110
- She didn't tell you?
- No, she did not.

480
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:29,710
- Said she was just visiting.
- More like sampling the trial version.

481
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:37,430
I mean, I've only known her
the past three years.

482
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:40,470
We talk on the comm box.

483
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:46,190
She told you how she ended up
quadriplegic?

484
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,110
And how long she's been that way?

485
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:54,230
One night, she's 21,
comes out to her folks.

486
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,990
They're a little uptight about it,
you might say.

487
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,830
They told her they don't
want a gay daughter.

488
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,990
It's not natural and so forth.

489
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:06,110
They fight. She gets in her car.
Runs it off the road. Boom!

490
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,310
- When she was 21?
- More than 40 years back.

491
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:12,430
It's been her whole lifetime, basically.

492
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:15,030
So the whole San Junipero system
has been a big deal for her.

493
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,630
The biggest deal.

494
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:21,630
Of course now, until she passes over,
it goes permanent,

495
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,110
she's on a five-hour weekly limit.

496
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,070
I guess you're the same.

497
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:29,630
They ration it out.
They don't trust us with more.

498
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:32,710
They say you go crazy
if you have too much, you know?

499
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:35,670
You don't leave your seat.
You disassociate body from mind.

500
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,790
Like that doesn't happen
in every senior home already. [laughs]

501
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:43,110
The system's there
for therapeutic reasons,

502
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:46,150
immersive nostalgia therapy.

503
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,750
Plunge you into a world of memories.

504
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:52,830
Helps with Alzheimer's,
that's what they say.

505
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,150
Small mercies.

506
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,790
So...

507
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,830
About this marriage...

508
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:05,150
The state's got a triple lockdown
on euthanasia cases.

509
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:09,350
You gotta have a sign-off from the doc,
the patient, a family member.

510
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:13,830
It's to stop folks from passing over just
because they prefer San Junipero flat out.

511
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,750
Anyhow, Yorkie's family,

512
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:19,030
they're big-time religious,
and they will not sign.

513
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,350
But a spouse can override them.

514
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:25,550
- Hence the wedding bells.
- You got it.

515
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:27,670
We got a pastor coming tomorrow a.m.,

516
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,590
and then she's scheduled to pass
tomorrow afternoon.

517
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:34,030
"Scheduled to pass."
Let's just call it dying.

518
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,110
If you can call it dying.

519
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:39,310
Uploaded to the cloud, sounds like heaven.

520
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,470
I guess.

521
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,630
You gonna wear a suit?

522
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:46,430
[laughs]

523
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,910
The ceremony's on my coffee break.

524
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:53,790
I never married so I just figured,
you know, what's the harm?

525
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,190
You're a good man.

526
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:59,670
It's the least I could do, right?

527
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,510
Think you could hook us up
to the system now?

528
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:09,630
Just for a little while,
before she passes?

529
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:13,310
You can still see her afterwards.
I mean, then she's no limit.

530
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:16,230
She's full, fat, permanent San Juniperan.

531
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:18,470
I know, but can you?

532
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:21,150
Seriously, it is so tight here
that they monitor every...

533
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,190
I only want a moment.

534
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:42,190
[Greg] Ma'am.

535
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:46,270
- You got five minutes
- Thank you.

536
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,110
Hey!

537
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:05,470
I've never been here
during the daylight.

538
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:07,470
It's warm.

539
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:11,190
Listen, I gotta be quick.
So I spoke to Greg.

540
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:12,390
Oh.

541
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:17,550
- You're passing over tomorrow?
- Yeah.

542
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,350
Couple of hours after the wedding.

543
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:24,510
So I guess I am technically
honeymooning here forever.

544
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,230
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
- [shushes]

545
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:34,350
- I'm gonna say something crazy.
- Okay.

546
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,150
Wanna marry me instead?

547
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:45,110
It's just... Greg seems great, but...

548
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,750
- Why not someone you've connected with?
- [laughs]

549
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,590
- [laughs] Is that a yes?
- [laughs]

550
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:04,110

in sickness and in health,

552
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:15,230

There you go.

563
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,510
Nearly there.

[Yorkie] Looks so real.

I just love it.

- You've been here before.
- But now I live here!

586
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:49,910
Be with me.

587
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:54,870
- I'm with you now.
- That's not what I mean.

588
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:58,150
Pass over.

589
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:02,430
- When it's your time.
- Yorkie.

590
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:05,870
- Stay here with me.
- Can we just enjoy tonight?

591
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:07,950
It's almost midnight.

592
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:09,390
In ten minutes, you're out of here.

593
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:11,110
Then I gotta wait a week
to see you again.

594
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:14,310
- You know I'm just a visitor.
- What, a couple of months, then what?

595
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:17,110
- We're not discussing this.
- Then you're gone.

596
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:21,030
- Just gone. You could have forever.
- Forever?

597
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:24,350
- Who can even make sense of forever?
- However long you want then.

598

I mean, you can remove yourself
like that. [snaps fingers]

[bangs vehicle]

- Hey! Oh. Hey.

It's real.

603
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:41,230
This is real.

604
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,470
And this.

605
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,510
- Hmm?
- Come on.

606
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:49,430
You know that was just a gesture.

607
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:55,110
- You married me.
- To help you pass over.

608
00:50:55,190 --> 00:51:00,070
- As a... kindness.
- It's not so kind to leave.

609
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:07,110
Okay, look, look, I'm sorry, I just...

610
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:10,910
I got this chance.

611
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:15,790
<i>We</i> got this chance.
I wanna share it with you.

612
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:20,830
I said I made my choice.

613
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:24,030
What is it? You feel bad
because your husband isn't here?

614
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:27,710
- Because that was his choice.
- Don't.

615
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:30,470
He chose not to stay here.
It's like he left you.

616
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:34,510
You know, he could have stayed,
but he chose to leave you.

617
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,870
- You don't know what you're saying.
- You should be mad at him.

618
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:38,990
- Not whipping yourself with guilt.
- Get off me.

619
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,950
You can't see it!
But what he did, it was selfish actually!

[gasps]

621

Forty-nine years...

622
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:56,510
I was with him for 49 years.

623
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:00,110
You can't begin to imagine.

624
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:02,830
You can't know...

625
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:08,230
the bond, the commitment, the boredom,

626
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:10,670
the yearning, the laughter,
the love of it.

627
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:13,310
The fucking love. You just cannot know!

628
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:17,430
Everything we sacrificed.

629
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:22,390
The years I gave him.
The years he gave me.

630
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:23,830
Did you think to ask?

631
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:28,390
Did it occur to you to ask?

632
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:32,350
We had a daughter.

633
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,310
Alison.

634
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:41,110
Always difficult, always beautiful.

635
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:43,910
Died at 39 years old, bless her heart.

636
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:47,070
And Richard and I,
we felt that heartbreak as one.

637
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:51,270
You think you're the only person
ever suffered, go fuck yourself.

638
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:53,550
- Well, I didn't know...
- Didn't think to.

639
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,630
You know, when he was dying,
Richard said to me

640
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:01,350
when they offered him this,
to pass over, pass through,

641
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:04,110
spend eternity in this fucking graveyard
you're so in love with,

642
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:09,870
he said, "How can I?
When she missed out, how can I?"

643
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:12,350
And so he went.

644
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:16,750
And I wish I could believe he's
with her now,

645
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:18,470
that they're together, but I don't.

646
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,390
I believe they're nowhere.
Just like you said.

647
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:27,070
Gone. No, I pitied you,
and that's the truth. I pitied you.

648
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:28,550
Now you give me some sales pitch

649
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:30,510
about how fucking peachy forever
could be.

650
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:31,630
I'm sorry.

651
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,910
You wanna spend forever
somewhere nothing matters?

652
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,790
