00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:47,867
Kenny? Big spillage on table four. Sorry.

4
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:59,707
Okay. All right.

5
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,908
Excuse me.

6
00:02:04,147 --> 00:02:05,624
Someone forgot this.

7
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:07,067
Oh, thank you!

8
00:02:07,907 --> 00:02:09,787
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

9
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:12,947
- It's all right.
- She forgets everything. Thanks again.

10
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:24,347
She was some yoga teacher,
proper bendy. Look. Look.

11
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:30,304
Jesus! Fuck! What, she
sent that to you, did she?

12
00:02:30,307 --> 00:02:31,467
Double naughty.

13
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:35,627
Jog on.

14
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:07,787
Linds!

15
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:10,912
Linds, where's my laptop?

16
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:16,024
- Don't be a bell end!
- Use your own.

17
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:19,544
- Mine's bust. Yours has gone all frozen.
- What did you do?

18
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:21,704
- I was trying to put on this film thing.
- What film thing?

19
00:03:21,707 --> 00:03:24,704
Don't know. Some programme
lets you watch free films.

20
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:27,402
While I was trying to put it on,
then it locked up.

21
00:03:27,427 --> 00:03:30,464
- Look, it's not my fault.
- Don't take it again. It's not yours.

22
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:33,825
- Oh, fix mine when you've done that.
- "Fix mine when you've done that."

- Whatever.

27
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:42,721
Did you draw that yourself, Kenny?

28
00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:53,161
Thanks, Kenny. See you tomorrow.

29
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:55,976
Bye.

30
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:59,201
- Bye, Kenny.
- Bye, Kenny, I'll see you tomorrow.

31
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,641
You're mental.

32
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:12,361
- You're mental.
- You're a thief.

33
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:31,041
Love? Kenny? What do you think?

34
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:34,598
- I'm still not used to the colour.
- It's nice.

35
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:35,761
Yeah?

36
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:39,001
Do me a favour and prison-guard
your sister, will you?

37
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,758
I won't be late. Probably.

38
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:49,598
Oh, my God! He's outside.
There's a lasagna thing in the freezer.

39
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:50,801
I love you.

Ha!

- Kenny?
- Feeling really sick.

70
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:35,901
- You've only just got here.
- I know but think I might throw up.

71
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,861
Okay, just next time can you...?

72
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,981
Whoa! Easy, knobber.

Come on.

77
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:50,609
- It's fragile.
- What is it?

78
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:57,729
They told me to do that.

79
00:15:03,395 --> 00:15:06,512
Is that it? What do I do now?

80
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:12,955
I can't really help you.

81
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:17,752
What do I have to do?

82
00:15:17,755 --> 00:15:20,435
Just whatever they say and once
you've done that, you're out.

83
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:22,195
They let you off.

Hello?

88
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:41,395
Del... Delivery.

89
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:44,275
Wrong room.

90
00:17:46,635 --> 00:17:48,155
They said 121.

91
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:56,032
No, there's no delivery here.

92
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:58,475
- But they said...
- I haven't ordered anything.

93
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,915
It's a cake.

94
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:12,432
- What cake?
- I don't know. I think it's a sponge.

95
00:18:12,435 --> 00:18:15,832
I didn't order a cake so
just take it back to the bakery

96
00:18:15,835 --> 00:18:17,872
- and tell them they got it wrong.
- Look, if I...

97
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:22,235
I don't want the cake.
So go away or I call the front desk.

98
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,149

99
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:37,314

100
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:48,072
I will kick that
cake up your fucking arse.

101
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:50,075
M-Mindy sent me.

102
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:04,512
- What is this? Where's Mindy?
- I was just told to give this to you.

103
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:06,392
- Mindy told you?
- No.

104
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,712
- You said "Mindy."
- That's what they told me to say.

105
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:15,992
Get inside.

106
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:22,432
So what are you saying?
Are you saying Mindy ordered the cake?

107
00:19:22,435 --> 00:19:26,792
No, uh, I don't know.
It... they... it was them.

108
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:29,312
Them? They? Who the
fuck are you on about?

109
00:19:29,315 --> 00:19:31,592
- The people.
- What fucking people?

110
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:33,832
The phone people.
The people on the phone.

111
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:37,272
They told me to bring the cake,
and they're leaving texts on my phone,

112
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:39,952
- and then I do what they say.
- Whoa, whoa. Slow down.

113
00:19:39,955 --> 00:19:41,712
Just breathe through your nose.

114
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:45,432
Through your nose. Okay?

115
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:50,155
Good. Now, just show me what
they said. On your phone.

116
00:19:50,995 --> 00:19:54,955
- Show me the text.
- Okay, well, um... This.

117
00:19:55,915 --> 00:19:58,955
- I should...
- Shut up. Just let me.

118
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:04,435
What the fuck is this?

119
00:20:06,035 --> 00:20:07,755
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.

120
00:20:08,995 --> 00:20:12,592
- Who are you?
- I'm not them.

121
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:15,992
They send me messages,
and I do what they say.

122
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:18,395
Why? Why would you do that?

123
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:41,915
Is it them?

124
00:21:04,921 --> 00:21:06,760
_

125
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,915
_

126
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,169
_

127
00:21:37,675 --> 00:21:41,435
- They said I had to do that.
- Jesus Christ!

128
00:21:51,955 --> 00:21:53,195
Okay, okay.

129
00:21:54,635 --> 00:21:58,432
They're saying they just need
us to follow their instructions,

130
00:21:58,435 --> 00:22:00,555
and everything will be okay. Okay?

131
00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:03,355
Shit!

132
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:08,835
They're saying we have to do it together.

133
00:22:09,675 --> 00:22:12,995
- What do we have to do?
- Just take the cake somewhere.

134
00:22:13,555 --> 00:22:16,992
They sent me an address.
A map coordinate thing.

135
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:20,475
- And there's a car we need to get.
- A car? What sort of car?

136
00:22:21,795 --> 00:22:25,232
I don't know what sort of car.
They said it's in the car park outside.

137
00:22:25,235 --> 00:22:27,595
They sent me a licence plate.
That's all I know.

138
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:30,315
Why both of us?

139
00:22:31,795 --> 00:22:33,155
I don't know!

140
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:36,832
Just let me deal with my
fucking shoe, please.

141
00:22:40,098 --> 00:22:41,358
_

142
00:22:41,383 --> 00:22:42,463
What have they said?

143
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:46,995
They say, "Go with him.
Take the package."

144
00:22:49,755 --> 00:22:50,948
Okay.

145
00:23:13,315 --> 00:23:15,272
I'm getting fucking
number blindness here.

146
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:16,395
That's it.

147
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:24,603
All right. They said the
keys are on the back. Okay.

148
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,512
Look, maybe you better
drive. Do you drive?

149
00:23:34,515 --> 00:23:38,032
- I mean, I had a drink back there.
- I can't. I can... I can drive.

150
00:23:38,035 --> 00:23:39,512
I'm still learning.
Haven't passed my test yet.

151
00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:42,635
All right. Uh... You're navigating.

152
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:45,112
Okay, you've got a sat nav on your phone?

153
00:23:45,115 --> 00:23:46,275
Yep.

154
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,752
Here it is. Punch that in.

155
00:23:49,755 --> 00:23:53,192
It's a street somewhere out of town.
Sort of High Wycombe-ish.

156
00:23:53,195 --> 00:23:56,555
They said we got to be there by two.
It's gonna be tight.

157
00:24:07,795 --> 00:24:12,035
So I'm guessing they got some shit on
you that they're threatening to put out?

158
00:24:19,595 --> 00:24:20,595
With me, it's...

159
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,515
You saw the room, fucking lacy knickers.

160
00:24:26,955 --> 00:24:29,112
I was waiting for a prostitute.

161
00:24:29,115 --> 00:24:31,475
Escort, hooker, whatever
they call them now.

162
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:34,755
I got a family, which is great.

163
00:24:37,315 --> 00:24:38,395
You get bored.

164
00:24:39,755 --> 00:24:41,715
I mean, when I was young, I used to like...

165
00:24:43,155 --> 00:24:46,752
I can't fucking justify it.
I just wanted to fuck a 20-something.

166
00:24:46,755 --> 00:24:48,792
For old times' sake, I don't know.

167
00:24:48,795 --> 00:24:53,435
I joined this website. I was curious.
Just wanted to see what was on there.

168
00:24:53,995 --> 00:24:56,755
I got talking to Mindy,
who I thought was Mindy.

169
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:01,952
I mean, she sent me pictures.
I sent some back.

170
00:25:01,955 --> 00:25:04,112
Phone photos. Grabbing my cock.

171
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:06,712
You name it.
They got the whole fucking thing.

172
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:10,352
But not just pictures, chat messages.
All the arrangements, where and when.

173
00:25:10,355 --> 00:25:12,832
Me haggling over the price
and they say they got it all.

174
00:25:12,835 --> 00:25:15,312
Sucked up the whole hard
drive like an audit.

175
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:20,072
Fucking twat. What a fucking idiot!

176
00:25:20,075 --> 00:25:23,232
If that shit gets out,
that's my wife out the door.

177
00:25:23,235 --> 00:25:25,152
Then there's the kids, she'll take them.

178
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:28,352
Oh, no, not a doubt in my mind
she'd take them and she'd win.

179
00:25:28,355 --> 00:25:29,992
Custody, she'd win.

180
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:33,712
And I'm not losing my kids.
I tell you that right now.

181
00:25:33,715 --> 00:25:36,312
No way! Absolutely fucking no!

182
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:43,635
They filmed me.

183
00:25:45,515 --> 00:25:48,115
- Filmed you...
- Through my computer camera.

184
00:25:49,075 --> 00:25:53,515
- What, like, filmed you?
- Yeah, like, you know, doing it.

185
00:25:54,235 --> 00:25:58,915
- Like sex?
- No. Like, you... you know.

186
00:25:59,755 --> 00:26:02,915
Jerking off. Jerking off
to porn or something?

187
00:26:03,835 --> 00:26:05,195
Well, everyone does that.

188
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:09,072
- The fucking pope probably does that.
- They're gonna put it everywhere.

189
00:26:09,075 --> 00:26:10,832
Like they're gonna send it to everyone.

190
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,712
- Oh, shit the fuck!
- What? What?

191
00:26:12,715 --> 00:26:15,512
- How long's that light been on?
- What light?

192
00:26:15,515 --> 00:26:17,795
Whoever's car this is,
they left it fucking empty.

193
00:26:26,635 --> 00:26:27,997
I won't be a minute.

194
00:26:30,835 --> 00:26:33,195
Unleaded. Unleaded.

195
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:36,799
Oh, bugger!

196
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:43,795
Listen, you pay, yeah? It'll save time.

197
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:45,435
Have you got any money?

198
00:26:48,235 --> 00:26:51,672
Okay, Visa card PIN number 3109.
Say that back to me.

199
00:26:51,675 --> 00:26:53,712
- Visa card...
- Just the number!

200
00:26:53,715 --> 00:26:56,035
- Uh... 3109.
- Okay, go!

201
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:01,235
Pump four!

202
00:27:24,355 --> 00:27:26,155
- What's your pump number?
- Four.

203
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:29,275
- You want some chocolate?
- No.

204
00:27:29,835 --> 00:27:31,995
- It's two for one this week.
- I'm okay.

205
00:27:33,715 --> 00:27:35,155
31.89.

206
00:27:39,395 --> 00:27:40,795
Pop your PIN in.

207
00:28:07,155 --> 00:28:09,832
- If you're sure you don't mind?
- No, no, of course not.

208
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:14,552
- I'll get on to that. Make some calls.
- Brilliant! It's next Wednesday.

209
00:28:14,555 --> 00:28:17,632
- Okay.
- Keep it non-dairy just to be safe.

210
00:28:17,635 --> 00:28:18,635
Okay.

211
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:24,275
This is, uh...

212
00:28:26,195 --> 00:28:28,072
my nephew.

213
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:29,515
Nice to meet you.

214
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,955
- Kenny.
- Kenny. I'm Karen.

215
00:28:34,115 --> 00:28:36,195
We're both Ks.

216
00:28:37,635 --> 00:28:41,312
I'm head of the PTA at Theo and
Cassie's school, for my sins.

217
00:28:41,315 --> 00:28:45,715
Just roped poor Hector into sorting
out the catering for the quiz night.

218
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,432
Been the usual balls up.

219
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:49,632
Listen, we better get this
guy to the station.

220
00:28:49,635 --> 00:28:52,272
His train's... So we better go.

221
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:55,072
- Cansroad Station?
- Yeah.

222
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:57,272
Oh, couldn't drop me at the
end of my road, could you?

223
00:28:57,275 --> 00:28:58,675
It's on the way. Mayer Street?

224
00:28:59,235 --> 00:29:01,232
It's the bus otherwise and that
goes all the way around the common.

225
00:29:01,235 --> 00:29:04,632
- We're in a bit of a rush, actually.
- Well, it's no detour. It's en route.

226
00:29:04,635 --> 00:29:08,395
I'll hop out. Hardly need
to slow down. Yeah?

227
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:14,355
- Yep. Sure. Let's go.
- Brilliant. Thanks!

228
00:29:14,915 --> 00:29:16,075
I'll just get in the back.

229
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:21,992
Oh, don't want to squash your box.

230
00:29:21,995 --> 00:29:23,915
- What's that? Present?
- It's a cake.

231
00:29:24,995 --> 00:29:28,795
- It's just a... it's a cake for Penny.
- Oh, lucky her.

232
00:29:32,475 --> 00:29:33,952
So how is Penny?

233
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:37,115
Haven't seen her since...
must have been sports day.

234
00:29:38,115 --> 00:29:39,552
She's good.

235
00:29:39,555 --> 00:29:42,832
- She still planning to get back to work?
- Yeah. Yep.

236
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,890
_

237
00:29:45,915 --> 00:29:49,555
- I mean, how old's Theo now?
- Uh... He's seven.

238
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,210
_

239
00:29:51,235 --> 00:29:55,392
He was so funny in the play.
That big top hat on.

240
00:29:55,395 --> 00:29:57,075
Yeah, he had a good time.

241
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,210
_

242
00:29:59,235 --> 00:30:01,552
Oh, Anna's
having a sleepover.

243
00:30:01,555 --> 00:30:03,992
Cassie's probably
already told you about it.

244
00:30:03,995 --> 00:30:07,872
Six nine-year-olds in the house.
I must be mad!

245
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,921
_

246
00:30:15,195 --> 00:30:16,755
So, Kenny, where you heading back to?

247
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:20,835
- Sorry. What?
- Are you going home or...?

248
00:30:21,555 --> 00:30:23,515
- Uh...
- Train. Birmingham.

249
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:25,672
Yeah. Uh...

250
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:29,792
- Yeah, I-I live in Birmingham.
- Oh, my husband's from Birmingham.

251
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,392
- What part are you?
- South.

252
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:32,955
South.

253
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:36,672
- Mainly.
- Right.

254
00:30:36,675 --> 00:30:38,832
_

255
00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:40,512
Have you always lived there?
'Cos you don't sound...

256
00:30:40,515 --> 00:30:42,712
I don't have the accent, no.
Everyone says that...

257
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,192
That... I don't have the accent.

258
00:30:47,115 --> 00:30:50,552
Didn't grow up there though.
I grew up somewhere else.

259
00:30:50,555 --> 00:30:53,632
Like London. I grew up in London.

260
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:54,795
Okay.

261
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:59,672
And is your mum and dad on
Hector's side or Penny's?

262
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:10,072
Someone crossing! Crossing!

263
00:31:15,435 --> 00:31:18,195
Sorry about that! Can't miss his train.

264
00:31:32,435 --> 00:31:34,835
This is me.

265
00:31:39,115 --> 00:31:41,752
Great to meet you, Kenny.
Give my best to Penny, won't you?

266
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:44,392
- Yes, of course.
- Bye, then.

267
00:31:44,395 --> 00:31:45,955
- Bye, Karen.
- Bye.

268
00:32:01,075 --> 00:32:02,355
We're gonna make it, okay?

269
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:05,075
It's this junction.

270
00:32:06,035 --> 00:32:07,835
- What? This one?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

271
00:32:25,555 --> 00:32:26,729
You sure this is it?

272
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:31,675
"Look in the cake."

273
00:32:36,035 --> 00:32:37,355
Let's look in the cake.

274
00:32:46,515 --> 00:32:47,915
Look in the cake.

275
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,795
In the cake, I suppose.

276
00:33:04,915 --> 00:33:06,115
I got something.

277
00:33:14,635 --> 00:33:16,158
What the fuck?

278
00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:25,955
Oh, my God.

279
00:33:34,835 --> 00:33:36,752
"Five minutes to decide."

280
00:33:36,755 --> 00:33:38,592
Decide what?

281
00:33:42,275 --> 00:33:44,915
- "Who is driver?"
- "Who is robber?"

282
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:57,192
_

283
00:33:58,155 --> 00:34:00,112
Oh, no. No.

284
00:34:00,115 --> 00:34:02,955
- W-w-we can't. We...
- I'm driver.

285
00:34:05,395 --> 00:34:07,315
You said you can't drive. I'm driver.

286
00:34:08,075 --> 00:34:10,115
I'll be right here with
the engine running.

287
00:34:11,035 --> 00:34:12,832
We... We can't. We...

288
00:34:12,835 --> 00:34:15,112
Then how else are we gonna
deal with this, Kenny?

289
00:34:15,115 --> 00:34:16,592
- I'm not...
- Listen to me.

290
00:34:16,595 --> 00:34:18,635
- I'm not...
- Shut up and listen!

291
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:23,232
Hat and sunglasses.
No one's going to ID you.

292
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:25,752
You could be Kevin fucking Bacon.
That's point one.

293
00:34:25,755 --> 00:34:30,472
Shut up!
Point two, in a robbery, staff are trained.

294
00:34:30,475 --> 00:34:31,512
I am not...

295
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:34,192
They are trained to hand over the cash.

296
00:34:34,195 --> 00:34:37,952
No argument. I saw it in a documentary.
No resistance. It looked easy.

297
00:34:37,955 --> 00:34:39,112
It's not easy.

298
00:34:39,115 --> 00:34:44,115
I know it isn't easy, but what the
fuck else are we gonna do? Hey?

299
00:34:45,995 --> 00:34:49,112
This gets out, I will lose my kids.

300
00:34:49,115 --> 00:34:51,912
And I swear to God,
I will stand in the kitchen

301
00:34:51,915 --> 00:34:54,955
and put a fucking bread knife
through my throat if that happens.

302
00:34:55,515 --> 00:34:59,755
- I only looked at pictures and...
- And beat one off on camera?

303
00:35:01,035 --> 00:35:02,435
That's what they got, yeah?

304
00:35:03,675 --> 00:35:08,435
Your hot little face, blurred fist,
dick burping fucking spunk everywhere?

305
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:13,552
Your mum's gonna love that on Facebook,
Twitter, Insta-fucking-whatever.

306
00:35:13,555 --> 00:35:16,075
And her friends. All eyes
on you, giving it that.

307
00:35:17,395 --> 00:35:20,472
Toss in the cunts at work,
calling you Spurty McGoo.

308
00:35:20,475 --> 00:35:23,352
Laughing at your come face,
making it their desktop wallpaper.

309
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:25,272
It's not just weeks.
We're talking years here.

310
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:28,112
Pictures hang about on Google
like a gypsy fucking curse.

311
00:35:28,115 --> 00:35:30,592
There's no cure for the Internet.
It would never go away.

312
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,635
It'd be glued to your name,
a fucking stain on you.

313
00:35:34,275 --> 00:35:36,032
I'd hang myself if that was me.

314
00:35:36,035 --> 00:35:38,195
Crack my fucking neck at
the first opportunity.

315
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:49,672
They just want the money,
so go in there and do it.

316
00:35:49,675 --> 00:35:53,432
- You'll drive away.
- I am not gonna drive away.

317
00:35:53,435 --> 00:35:55,755
I'm gonna be sat here
with the engine running.

318
00:35:57,395 --> 00:35:58,712
I can't. I can't.

319
00:35:58,715 --> 00:36:01,915
- You can. You can.
- I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't.

320
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:04,152
- You can.
- I can't.

321
00:36:04,155 --> 00:36:06,475
We don't have much time, Kenny.

322
00:36:10,115 --> 00:36:13,352
- It's not real. This is not real.
- You can do this.

323
00:36:15,635 --> 00:36:17,472
Keep it together. Please hold it together.

324
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:20,995
- Shut up, shut up, shut up! Shut up!
- Okay.

325
00:36:26,355 --> 00:36:27,155
Have you got a bag?

326
00:36:28,995 --> 00:36:31,915
Glasses. Breathe through your nose.

327
00:37:22,915 --> 00:37:24,915
Give me money.

328
00:37:32,555 --> 00:37:34,872
Just give me money!

329
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:40,352
- Yes. Okay.
- Lots of it. I need lots of it.

330
00:37:40,355 --> 00:37:42,395
Sh-should I use your bag?

331
00:37:45,915 --> 00:37:47,315
Take it.

332
00:37:58,595 --> 00:38:02,995
I'm going to pass this
back to you now. Is that okay?

333
00:38:38,355 --> 00:38:40,872
There was some bloke standing
there on his phone freaking me out.

334
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:42,555
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

335
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:53,432
Go faster.

336
00:38:53,435 --> 00:38:56,315
Speed limit's 40. Wanna
get stopped for speeding now?

337
00:39:04,035 --> 00:39:06,795
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck!

338
00:39:19,595 --> 00:39:20,952
That's a siren.

339
00:39:20,955 --> 00:39:23,555
Shh! Shush.

340
00:39:29,195 --> 00:39:31,355
- Let's go!
- Shut up.

341
00:39:34,715 --> 00:39:36,235
Wait, wait.

342
00:39:37,555 --> 00:39:38,715
Come on.

343
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:41,155
Come on.

344
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:43,515
Okay.

345
00:40:12,355 --> 00:40:13,675
We're okay.

346
00:40:14,235 --> 00:40:17,715
We should text them, no?
Tell them we got the money.

347
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:27,115
- They say we got to take it somewhere.
- Where?

348
00:40:45,955 --> 00:40:47,315
This is it.

349
00:40:48,275 --> 00:40:49,315
Yeah.

350
00:40:53,515 --> 00:40:54,755
Here we go.

351
00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:57,429
"Final instruction."

352
00:40:59,115 --> 00:41:00,635
"Take car away and destroy."

353
00:41:02,995 --> 00:41:05,035
Destroy the car.

354
00:41:06,035 --> 00:41:07,155
"Just you alone."

355
00:41:10,275 --> 00:41:12,915
Why just you?

356
00:41:13,865 --> 00:41:16,144
_

357
00:41:16,216 --> 00:41:17,866
_

358
00:41:21,995 --> 00:41:24,035
I got to take the money
somewhere over there.

359
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:28,955
Why? Why have I got to do it?

360
00:41:30,475 --> 00:41:32,275
Fuck knows.

361
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,849
_

362
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:35,995
So...

363
00:41:39,315 --> 00:41:40,555
You better go, yeah?

364
00:41:44,355 --> 00:41:46,915
Hey, you got this far, haven't you?

365
00:41:48,555 --> 00:41:52,355
Just drop it off. That's it.

366
00:41:53,355 --> 00:41:54,565
You'll be all right.

367
00:42:05,195 --> 00:42:11,312
Hey, listen, Kenny. Look.
I'm sorry about... just back there.

368
00:42:11,315 --> 00:42:14,075
Shouting at you. Calling you stuff.

369
00:42:15,155 --> 00:42:19,035
I'm an all right bloke really.
I swear I am, when it's...

370
00:42:20,635 --> 00:42:22,155
When stuff's normal.

371
00:42:24,755 --> 00:42:26,235
You take care, yeah?

372
00:44:28,444 --> 00:44:29,684
Yeah, yeah. Hang on, hang on.

373
00:44:40,075 --> 00:44:42,115
They told me I had to
set this thing off first.

374
00:45:01,515 --> 00:45:02,515
Okay.

375
00:45:04,355 --> 00:45:05,515
You got the prize money?

376
00:45:06,795 --> 00:45:10,875
- Prize money?
- You know, for the... fight?

377
00:45:12,275 --> 00:45:14,275
How is there a fight?

378
00:45:14,835 --> 00:45:17,035
- They didn't tell you?
- No.

379
00:45:21,115 --> 00:45:22,635
We've got to fight...

380
00:45:24,515 --> 00:45:26,515
...or else they post
everything they've got on us.

381
00:45:27,595 --> 00:45:29,155
Winner takes the money.

382
00:45:33,115 --> 00:45:34,475
We've got to do it.

383
00:45:35,915 --> 00:45:37,952
I mean...

384
00:45:37,955 --> 00:45:39,355
They're watching.

385
00:45:43,315 --> 00:45:47,555
What sort of fight?
How do we know when it's over?

386
00:45:49,155 --> 00:45:50,915
How... How do we know who's won?

387
00:45:57,035 --> 00:46:02,992
I don't know about you,
but my life's over if this gets out.

388
00:46:05,635 --> 00:46:06,915
Fucking over.

389
00:46:12,515 --> 00:46:13,875
What they get you for?

390
00:46:15,035 --> 00:46:16,872
I just looked at some photos.

391
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:19,552
That's all.
I just looked at one or two photos.

392
00:46:19,555 --> 00:46:21,952
Yeah.

393
00:46:21,955 --> 00:46:24,515
Yeah, yeah, I just
looked at pictures too.

394
00:46:27,755 --> 00:46:31,275
How young were they? In the pictures?

395
00:46:33,675 --> 00:46:35,635
How young?

396
00:46:40,515 --> 00:46:41,675
Yeah.

397
00:46:43,155 --> 00:46:44,555
Well, me too.

398
00:47:02,795 --> 00:47:05,955
Look, mate. Don't. Please.

399
00:47:07,515 --> 00:47:08,795
Please.

400
00:47:09,395 --> 00:47:10,795
