00:21:12,097 --> 00:21:13,949
Why don't you spend it on you, then?

184
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:16,772
And buy what? Some new shoes
for my doppel to wear?

185
00:21:18,084 --> 00:21:20,739
I don't know, upgrade your MOS...

186
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,733
Or get a Fat Attack season pass?

187
00:21:23,793 --> 00:21:25,619
Buy one of those wall buddies.

188
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:29,037
The new ones that talk to you after
shutting and solve your problems.

189
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,044
They guide your dreams, like gurus.
It's amazing, really, what they can do.

190
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:36,619
A mirror plug-in? That shows me how I
look as a werewolf? What's the point?

191
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,863
- I know it can be quite funny.
- It's all just stuff. It's...

192
00:21:41,304 --> 00:21:43,968
It's stuff, it's confetti, it's...

193
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,526
You've got something real.

194
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,263
What better to spend it on?

195
00:21:52,388 --> 00:21:54,452
You heard me singing in a toilet.

196
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,139
Is that real?

197
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,618
More than anything that's
happened all year.

198
00:22:03,717 --> 00:22:06,329
I can't take that kind of clockage
off someone.

199
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,288
It's 12 mils, no way.

200
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,271
Let me do this.

201
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:17,224
I... I look around here, I just...

202
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,992
I just want something real to happen.

203
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:24,949
Just once.

204
00:22:27,996 --> 00:22:29,299
I'd mess up.

205
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,144
You wouldn't. I don't care anyway.

206
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,979
I'll go with you.
I'll be able to force you.

207
00:22:35,246 --> 00:22:36,875
I'll force you to go.

208
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,243
It's tomorrow.

209
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:43,571
Come on!

210
00:22:50,212 --> 00:22:51,518
Say yes.

211
00:22:55,183 --> 00:22:57,457
I'll go as far as to say, "OK."

212
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,471
Which proves acceptable.

213
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,456
Thank God for that.

214
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,850
Walking away now.

215
00:23:12,206 --> 00:23:13,511
You loon!

216
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,991
I can live with it!

217
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:49,445
I'd love to fucking ruin that
and all.

218
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,926
What?

219
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,735
15?

220
00:24:24,306 --> 00:24:25,617
A flippin' joke...

221
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,681
'New from Wraith Babes.

222
00:25:18,694 --> 00:25:21,952
'The hottest girls
in the nastiest situations.'

223
00:25:23,053 --> 00:25:24,571
Oh, yeah! Ooh!

224
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,671
Can't believe I'm doing this.

225
00:25:42,887 --> 00:25:44,195
I am doing this.

226
00:25:47,773 --> 00:25:49,104
I can't be doing this.

227
00:25:49,129 --> 00:25:50,646
Can you trade it back?

228
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,395
The ticket?

229
00:25:52,688 --> 00:25:53,770
Don't be mad.

230
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:57,145
It's a lot of pressure
to put someone under, you know.

231
00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:00,264
Don't think I'm not grateful.
But it's, it's just...

232
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:01,595
You're babbling.

233
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,190
I'm babbling.

234
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:13,030
I made you this.

235
00:26:16,587 --> 00:26:20,131
You never get to keep them more
than a day, but there it is, anyway.

236
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:26,094
It folds flat.

237
00:26:26,512 --> 00:26:29,186
So you can keep them
in your waistband.

238
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,749
Thank you.

239
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,599
It's, you know...

240
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:43,207
something.

241
00:27:13,556 --> 00:27:14,997
Face the screen, please.

242
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,399
Is he your Friends And Family
allocation?

243
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,270
Hand, please.

244
00:27:26,513 --> 00:27:27,514
Oh!!

245
00:27:27,936 --> 00:27:29,527
That's not permanent, is it?

246
00:27:29,652 --> 00:27:31,039
Oh, no. Two months max.

247
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,298
Round to the right,
and through the scanner.

248
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,084
Where do we go now?

249
00:27:59,716 --> 00:28:01,028
You wait here.

250
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,381
How long?

251
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:09,344
So, what do we do?

252
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:10,639
I don't know.

253
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,575
Hey, hey, hey.
Fuck off.

254
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:20,075
Her with the dark hair?

255
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The pretty one.

256
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,879
Yup. OK. Move.

257
00:28:26,243 --> 00:28:27,888
They want to preview you.

258
00:28:28,585 --> 00:28:30,319
- What?
- Preview. Come on.

259
00:28:30,768 --> 00:28:32,323
- He's with me.
- Hand?

260
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,568
Show me your hand.

261
00:28:36,097 --> 00:28:37,399
OK. You, too.

262
00:28:37,524 --> 00:28:39,825
That's not fair.
She's new. That's not fair.

263
00:28:39,829 --> 00:28:41,339
I don't pick the order.

264
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:44,068
I've waited here all week,
and she's just walked in.

265
00:28:44,147 --> 00:28:47,962
Everyone will get seen eventually.
I don't pick the order.

266
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,446
But I'm a good singer.

267
00:28:49,454 --> 00:28:52,070
I can sing. I'm a good singer, I am.

268
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:54,420
- Stand aside.
- It's not fair!

269
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,795
It's not fair!

270
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:04,884
- Next lot.
- Stand there.

271
00:29:09,506 --> 00:29:12,024
Would you like to be as big as Salma
one day?

272
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:15,253
Erm...
Yeah, I mean...

273
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:16,519
Could you say that

274
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,117
as a self-contained sentence
into that screen?

275
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,159
I guess I'd like to be
as big as Salma one day.

276
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,119
OK. Proceed to stage area.

277
00:29:26,944 --> 00:29:28,250
Are we done?

278
00:29:31,286 --> 00:29:33,325
- Both performing?
- Just her.

279
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,959
- Okay... and what are you?
- Singer.

280
00:29:36,293 --> 00:29:38,111
- Compliance?
- No, thanks.

281
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:41,336
A-ha. Yes, thanks!
It's compulsory for all contestants.

282
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:43,878
More to the point,
it'll stop you puking with nerves.

283
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:46,128
- She's got to perform.
- Well, mmm

284
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,549
Look, just sip it, you'll be fine.

285
00:29:53,163 --> 00:29:55,157
Just a touch of light foam.
It'll pass.

286
00:29:55,282 --> 00:29:56,706
Make the most of it.

287
00:29:56,831 --> 00:29:58,677
You can't get this stuff
anywhere else.

288
00:29:59,124 --> 00:30:00,679
You OK?
Yeah.

289
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,989
You OK?

290
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,077
Yeah. Just, erm...

291
00:30:07,192 --> 00:30:11,199
I don't know. Things are just
wider apart. I'm fine.

292
00:30:12,004 --> 00:30:14,565
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

293
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,886
Right. You're on.

294
00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:36,213
A little closer, please.

295
00:30:40,946 --> 00:30:42,277
Little closer.

296
00:30:45,488 --> 00:30:47,080
Into the light, love.

297
00:30:55,444 --> 00:30:58,652
- And who're we looking at here?
- Abi Khan.

298
00:30:59,286 --> 00:31:01,661
What are you going
to do for us today, Abi?

299
00:31:02,246 --> 00:31:03,639
I'm going to sing.

300
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,099
You speak up, love.

301
00:31:05,224 --> 00:31:06,570
We don't bite.

302
00:31:08,186 --> 00:31:09,492
I'm going to sing.

303
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,519
Hey, would you mind
lifting up your top for me?

304
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:16,776
Can you take off your top?

305
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,781
I want to check out those titties.

306
00:31:18,906 --> 00:31:19,962
Woo-hoo-hoo!

307
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,271
Oh!

308
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:24,031
Come on. Mucho feranto.

309
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:27,058
Ah! No titties?

310
00:31:27,864 --> 00:31:30,003
She says she's here to sing.

311
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,959
I got to see
those titties, though.

312
00:31:33,084 --> 00:31:34,479
Come on, girl.

313
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,826
I mean, damn!

314
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:37,199
Heh-heh-heh.

315
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,879
You hot.

316
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:41,818
Please, just sing for us.

That was...

346
00:34:10,943 --> 00:34:12,168
without a doubt...

347
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,639
probably the best piece of singing
we've had this season.

348
00:34:18,866 --> 00:34:20,818
Yes! Well done!

349
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,349
Fair play.

350
00:34:30,644 --> 00:34:32,199
But I have to say...

351
00:34:34,336 --> 00:34:36,189
No. No, no, no.
I have to say,

352
00:34:37,047 --> 00:34:38,355
actually,

353
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:40,010
I'm with Rafe on this one.

354
00:34:41,577 --> 00:34:44,119
Good though your voice is...
and it is good.

355
00:34:44,631 --> 00:34:47,319
It's not the most magical sound
in the world.

356
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,885
It's just... good.

357
00:34:50,136 --> 00:34:52,934
I don't think anyone's
really hearing it.

358
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:55,558
Certainly not the guys
in the audience.

359
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:59,039
These looks you got going on
kind of get in the way.

360
00:34:59,536 --> 00:35:01,812
Men will want you.
Women will hate you.

361
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:03,917
All the time you're on stage.

362
00:35:05,242 --> 00:35:06,995
Couldn't help picturing you.

363
00:35:07,925 --> 00:35:09,439
In an erotic scenario.

364
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:13,167
Getting pretty turned on,
if I'm honest.

365
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,355
Right.

366
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,164
You've got this pure beauty

367
00:35:20,823 --> 00:35:22,950
What seems to be
a knockout figure.

368
00:35:23,646 --> 00:35:26,599
And this sort of interesting
innocence going on.

369
00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:29,059
That's something I think
Rafe's erotica channels

370
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:30,719
could really play with.

371
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,239
Absolutely. That's what I thought

372
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,639
the moment I saw you.

373
00:35:34,817 --> 00:35:36,119
The moment.

374
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,999
I'd watch. I don't know a man here
who wouldn't.

375
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,475
To be honest,
some of us girls might join you.

376
00:35:46,415 --> 00:35:47,746
Get off me!

377
00:35:47,871 --> 00:35:49,188
Don't! Abi!

378
00:35:50,323 --> 00:35:52,550
No! Abi! Abi!

379
00:35:52,675 --> 00:35:54,679
I don't think that's quite...

380
00:35:57,005 --> 00:36:01,557
You will never have to pedal again.
Not one minute.

381
00:36:02,531 --> 00:36:04,745
We could really work with you.

382
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:08,015
Last year we had
singers, singers, singers.

383
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:09,578
So many singers.

384
00:36:09,603 --> 00:36:12,437
So, to be a singer you have to be
truly exceptional

385
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:16,639
There's just no slots left
for an above average singer.

386
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,359
Not for the next few years,
at least. Charity?

387
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,242
No. Saturation point, singer-wise.

388
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,415
Listen. We said,
right from the start.

389
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,115
We'll go with something
different this season.

390
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,155
That's why he's on the panel!

391
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:34,184
She would be a star on our stream.

392
00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:36,039
A star.

393
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:37,996
On his...

394
00:36:39,434 --> 00:36:41,079
You're furniture, at best.

395
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,942
Forget about all the shame,
and all that ppht-ppht-tew.

396
00:36:44,738 --> 00:36:46,399
We medicate against that.

397
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,720
You will have pleasure forever.

398
00:36:49,018 --> 00:36:51,307
Realistically, sweetheart,
it is that,

399
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,946
or the bike.

400
00:36:56,396 --> 00:36:57,734
I, I don't think...

401
00:36:57,742 --> 00:36:59,762
This is starting to annoy me.

402
00:37:00,203 --> 00:37:03,311
Who do you think is powering
that spotlight?

403
00:37:09,249 --> 00:37:11,201
Millions of people. That's who.

404
00:37:11,686 --> 00:37:13,863
All of them, out there, right now.

405
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,043
Putting in an honest day
on the bike,

406
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,530
while you stand in the light
they're generating

407
00:37:19,547 --> 00:37:20,713
and dither.

408
00:37:21,071 --> 00:37:22,376
You know what?

409
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:26,507
They would give anything.
Do anything to be where you are now.

410
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:28,484
Am I right?!

411
00:37:31,712 --> 00:37:34,970
You want to cock a snook at all
that, as though it's nothing.

412
00:37:36,762 --> 00:37:38,453
As though they're nothing.

413
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,860
And that makes me sick.

414
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,483
But, you know what?

415
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,711
Maybe you do belong on the bike.

416
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,907
Because you don't seem to be
very willing to step off it.

417
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:54,035
I do want to.

418
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:55,378
We have a decision?

419
00:37:55,503 --> 00:38:00,479
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

420
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,879
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

421
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,879
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

422
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,559
I suppose.

423
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,359
Woo-hoo-hoo! Go on!

424
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,665
Well done!

425
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,464

00:39:49,832 --> 00:39:51,535
I get to meet lots of hot guys.

429
00:40:01,171 --> 00:40:02,738

430
00:40:03,123 --> 00:40:06,256
I... pay... for... this!

431
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:10,086
I pump my arse off, and you...
Fuck you!

432
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,939
Yeah, keep waddling, pig tits.

00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,376
An entertainer.

Could you say that down the screen
as a self-contained sentence?

00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,899
I'm an entertainer.

Yes.

00:49:58,115 --> 00:50:00,440
Mmm!
Man of mystery!

502
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,409
Hmm.

503
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,312

504
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:09,215

00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:11,127
Stop or I'll do it. This is a main
artery. Keep walking, you kill me.

508
00:51:14,999 --> 00:51:18,630
No-one stops me till I've said my piece.
Then you can do what you like.

509

Man, just fucking kill yourself.

00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,219

00:51:48,168 --> 00:51:49,478
Well?

517
00:51:49,499 --> 00:51:50,857
Come on.

518
00:51:51,339 --> 00:51:53,838
Got our attention, as requested.

519
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,686
What do you want to say?

520
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,059
Have you prepared a speech,
is that it?

521
00:52:05,032 --> 00:52:06,338
Speak!

522
00:52:06,343 --> 00:52:09,894
I haven't got a speech. I didn't
plan words. I didn't even try to...

523
00:52:09,895 --> 00:52:13,449
I just knew I had to get here, to stand
here, and I wanted you to listen.

524
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:16,436
To really listen, not just pull
a face like you're listening,

525
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,111
like you do the rest of the time.

526
00:52:18,117 --> 00:52:20,740
A face that you're feeling
instead of processing.

527
00:52:20,865 --> 00:52:23,539
You pull a face, and poke it towards
the stage,

528
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,935
and we lah-di-dah,
we sing and dance and tumble around.

529
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:30,498
And all you see up here,
it's not people,

530
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:33,019
you don't see people up here,
it's all fodder.

531
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,484
And the faker the fodder,
the more you love it,

532
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,179
because fake fodder's the only
thing that works any more.

533
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,739
It's all that we can stomach.
Actually, not quite all.

534
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,059
Real pain, real viciousness,
that, we can take.

535
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,696
Yeah, stick a fat man up a pole.

536
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,619
We laugh ourselves feral,
because we've earned the right,

537
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:50,138
we've done cell time
and he's slacking, the scum,

538
00:52:50,144 --> 00:52:51,367
so ha-ha-ha at him!

539
00:52:51,382 --> 00:52:53,987
Because we're so out of our minds
with desperation,

540
00:52:53,988 --> 00:52:55,730
we don't know any better.

541
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:58,219
All we know is fake fodder
and buying shit.

542
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,019
That's how we speak to each other,

543
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,268
how we express ourselves,
is buying shit.

544
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:03,659
What, I have a dream?

545
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:07,965
The peak of our dreams is a new app
for our Dopple, it doesn't exist!

546
00:53:07,989 --> 00:53:09,379
It's not even there!

547
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,139
We buy shit that's not even there.

548
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,339
Show us something real and free
and beautiful. You couldn't.

549
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,819
Yeah? It'd break us.

550
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,419
We're too numb for it.

551
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:18,899
I might as well choke.

552
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,939
It's only so much wonder
we can bear.

553
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:24,624
When you find any wonder whatsoever,
you dole it out in meagre portions.

554
00:53:24,632 --> 00:53:26,967
Only then until it's
augmented, packaged, and

555
00:53:26,979 --> 00:53:29,495
pumped through 10,000
preassigned filters

556
00:53:29,502 --> 00:53:32,539
till it's nothing more than
a meaningless series of lights,

557
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,939
while we ride day in day out,
going where?

558
00:53:36,823 --> 00:53:38,141
Powering what?

559
00:53:38,681 --> 00:53:41,926
All tiny cells and tiny screens
and bigger cells

560
00:53:41,934 --> 00:53:43,704
and bigger screens and fuck you!

561
00:53:43,907 --> 00:53:47,013
Fuck you,
that's what it boils down to.

562
00:53:47,722 --> 00:53:51,259
Fuck you for sitting there
and slowly making things worse.

563
00:53:51,384 --> 00:53:54,819
Fuck you and your spotlight
and your sanctimonious faces.

564
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,099
Fuck you all for thinking
the one thing

565
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,339
I came close to never meant
anything.

566
00:54:00,052 --> 00:54:04,272
For oozing around it and crushing it
into a bone, into a joke.

567
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,739
One more ugly joke
in a kingdom of millions.

568
00:54:08,254 --> 00:54:10,187
Fuck you for happening.

569
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,655
Fuck you for me, for us,
for everyone.

570
00:54:14,673 --> 00:54:15,979
Fuck you!

571
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:40,524
That was, without a doubt,

572
00:54:42,357 --> 00:54:46,212
the most heartfelt thing
I've seen on this stage

573
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:48,486
since Hotshot began!

574
00:54:53,971 --> 00:54:55,278
Brilliant!

575
00:54:55,703 --> 00:54:56,924
You...

576
00:54:57,623 --> 00:55:00,659
you're so articulating
something we all,

577
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,335
and I mean everyone in this hall,

578
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,779
something we all agree on.

579
00:55:06,254 --> 00:55:08,979
Even though we may not comprehend
all of it.

580
00:55:09,465 --> 00:55:12,462
I think I'm right in saying
we do feel it.

581
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:15,135
Even me.

582
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,775
I know you've got me down
as this creature.

583
00:55:18,297 --> 00:55:20,150
You know, hey...

584
00:55:21,677 --> 00:55:23,854
I get where you're coming from.

585
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:26,408
- I like your stuff.
- It's not stuff.

586
00:55:26,433 --> 00:55:28,417
It's truth. Am I right?

587
00:55:30,479 --> 00:55:34,019
Your truth, admittedly,
but truth nonetheless.

588
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,050
And you're right.

589
00:55:36,346 --> 00:55:39,877
Authenticity is in woefully
short supply.

590
00:55:42,121 --> 00:55:44,177
I'd like to hear you talk again.

591
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,890
How so?

592
00:55:49,469 --> 00:55:51,956
The slot on one of my streams

593
00:55:52,938 --> 00:55:55,351
where you can talk just like that.

594
00:55:58,761 --> 00:56:01,709
I'd watch it.
It was such great passion.

595
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:07,480
He's a'right.
You're a little hot there, bud.

596
00:56:08,241 --> 00:56:10,542

Neat gimmick.
