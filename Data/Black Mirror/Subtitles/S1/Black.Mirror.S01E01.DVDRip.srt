1
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,441
Hello.

2
00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:54,410
Just tell me what's happened.

3
00:00:56,574 --> 00:00:58,082
And what is it?

4
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:04,270
I'll be right down.

5
00:01:05,972 --> 00:01:07,301
What's happened?

6
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,934
Er, Susannah.

7
00:01:11,246 --> 00:01:12,551
Susannah?

8
00:01:13,712 --> 00:01:15,121
Princess Susannah.

9
00:01:15,624 --> 00:01:16,926
Is she all right?

10
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:20,043
Don't know.

11
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,262
Don't kill me.

12
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:49,668
Please don't kill me.

13
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,473
Read the statement.

14
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:56,254
Yes. All right.

15
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,520
On this screen?

16
00:02:01,094 --> 00:02:02,496
That is correct.

17
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:08,238
I'm Susannah,

18
00:02:09,518 --> 00:02:11,020
Duchess of Beaumont.

19
00:02:12,418 --> 00:02:15,714
Popularly known as Princess Susannah.

20
00:02:18,182 --> 00:02:20,741
I am in a place you... er...

21
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:24,575
cannot find, held by
one you will not trace.

22
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,473
Prime Minister Michael Callow...

23
00:02:35,704 --> 00:02:39,692
Prime Minister Michael Callow my life...

24
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:45,668
... my life depends on you.

25
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,801
If you do not do precisely
as instructed by, um...

26
00:02:52,645 --> 00:02:54,918
by 4pm this afternoon, I will be...

27
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,293
... I will be executed.

28
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:07,192
Please.

29
00:03:09,248 --> 00:03:10,551
What are you doing? Keep it going.

30
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,863
Prime Minister, at this point,
I think it's important to say

31
00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:17,419
that we are 100% certain

32
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:19,659
that this is, indeed,

33
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,027
Princess Susannah.

34
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,411
Her car was intercepted
shortly after midnight,

35
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,350
returning from the wedding
of a college friend.

36
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:29,400
She'd insisted on going.

37
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:31,301
But you had security on her?

38
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:33,379
Two PPOs, still unconscious.

39
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:36,715
Heavy sedative, close range,
each with a single puncture wound.

40
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:38,465
No sign of struggle.

41
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:42,372
What do they want? Money?

42
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:46,114
Release the Jihadi?

43
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:48,614
Scrap Third World debt?

44
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,899
Save the fucking libraries?

45
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,731
We are convinced both the video and
the demand it contains are genuine.

46
00:03:57,754 --> 00:03:58,856
What demand?

47
00:03:58,873 --> 00:04:01,153
What Susannah says next...

48
00:04:03,486 --> 00:04:05,684
It concerns you directly, sir.

49
00:04:08,107 --> 00:04:09,434
Just play it.

50
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:16,958
There is only one demand,
and it is a simple one.

51
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,419
At 4pm this afternoon,

52
00:04:20,717 --> 00:04:24,317
Prime Minister Michael Callow must
appear on live British television

53
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:26,934
on all networks,
terrestrial and satellite,

54
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,278
and... No!

55
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,582
On all British networks,
terrestrial and satellite,

56
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:44,325
and have full unsimulated
sexual intercourse with a pig.

57
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:49,299
I don't understand!

58
00:04:51,543 --> 00:04:53,348
The video ends with
a series of technical

59
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:55,153
specifications for the broadcast.

60
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:11,718
Why are you doing this?

61
00:05:15,653 --> 00:05:17,036
Is this joke, right?

62
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:19,551
"Ha ha, Mike! Ho ho."

63
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:21,246
It's real.

64
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:26,926
She said pig.

65
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:29,324
Sex with a pig.

66
00:05:32,454 --> 00:05:34,473
They want me to have sex with a pig?

67
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,856
Live on television

68
00:05:38,502 --> 00:05:39,817
this afternoon.

69
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:47,160
But what... ? Who... ?

70
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:51,309
We're checking with embedded
operatives, compiling a list of suspects.

71
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,903
Meanwhile, the demand has been made.

72
00:05:54,301 --> 00:05:56,793
There's not long to
formulate our response.

73
00:05:57,552 --> 00:05:59,113
Well, I'm not fucking a pig!

74
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,621
Page one, that's not happening.

75
00:06:03,817 --> 00:06:05,121
Of course.

76
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,301
Absolutely, sir.

77
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,668
Well, have we established
a dialogue with this... ?

78
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:21,981
We can't. There's no e-mail
address, no code word.

79
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,780
No channel for negotiation.

80
00:06:25,324 --> 00:06:28,779
So we focus on finding
Susannah. We get her back.

81
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:31,926
However it's done, I don't
care. We stop this now.

82
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,223
Everyone's working towards this.

83
00:06:34,278 --> 00:06:38,197
Yes. No. Not everyone. A dedicated
core team. This can't go wide.

84
00:06:38,737 --> 00:06:41,949
Keep it so far from the press
it's on the other side of Jupiter.

85
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,442
This only exists in this room.

86
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:48,129
It's already outside it.

87
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:54,067
If there are hacks sniffing around,
shut them down, bright, red, D Notice.

88
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:58,219
Super fucking Godzilla injunction
with ten-inch Whitehall fangs!

89
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,360
This video came from YouTube.

90
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:03,966
What?

91
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:06,659
It was uploaded via an
encrypted IP an hour ago.

92
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,940
Well, get it off there!

93
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:13,298
We did after nine minutes, long enough
for it to be duplicated and spread.

94
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,287
Spread? How many people have seen this?

95
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:20,819
We take down one, six
clones pop up elsewhere.

96
00:07:20,826 --> 00:07:22,147
How many people?

97
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:24,318
50,000. That's our current estimate.

98
00:07:26,296 --> 00:07:28,342
The news rooms have got it.

99
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:30,120
They're running this on air?

100
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:33,927
No. We put a type five D notice
out and they're complying.

101
00:07:34,014 --> 00:07:35,318
For now.

102
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:37,180
It's trending on Twitter.

103
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,569
Oh! For... fucking internet!

104
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:46,455
So what now? What's the play book?

105
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,150
This is virgin
territory, Prime Minister.

106
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,666
There's no play book.

107
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,259
Princess Susannah's been kidnapped!

108
00:07:58,281 --> 00:07:59,721
You scared the shit out of me!

109
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,286
There's a youtube of it!

110
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:02,614
Go to work!

111
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:04,341
And satellite,

112
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:09,587
... And have full unsimulated
sexual intercourse with a pig.

113
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:12,423
No way. It's a piss
take, man. Look at it!

114
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,940
I don't understand!

115
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:15,604
Why this is on the news?

116
00:08:15,697 --> 00:08:18,779
... Carlton Bloom's
controversial exhibition

117
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,259
closes three weeks ahead of schedule...

118
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,299
How do we describe
it? "An indecent act"?

119
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,299
Everyone's seen the video.
They know the details.

120
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,856
If we mention bestiality
Ofcom would be pissed off.

121
00:08:31,864 --> 00:08:32,829
Fuck Ofcom!

122
00:08:32,856 --> 00:08:34,179
We're observing the D Notice.

123
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,490
Surely we're going to do something.

124
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:36,616
We are honouring the D Notice.

125
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:37,928
The voluntary D Notice!

126
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:40,744
It may be a sportsman-like
gesture but we are making it.

127
00:08:40,745 --> 00:08:43,529
A woman's life is at stake!

128
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:44,780
We follow the procedure.

129
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,614
My timeline consists
of 100% viewers asking

130
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,418
why we're not covering
it. How do I reply?

131
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:51,215
You don't.

132
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:52,692
That is totally backwards.

133
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:54,238
No-one else has broken rank.

134
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:55,894
Not the Beeb, not Sky, not...

135
00:08:55,922 --> 00:08:58,917
Facebook's coverage is
pretty comprehensive!

136
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:00,488
Maybe

137
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:01,871
It's like 9/11's happening and

138
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:03,473
we're broadcasting sandwich recipes.

139
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:05,572
We're not a chat room!

140
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:08,478
It's on CNN and Fox.

141
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,041
And MSNBC, Al Jazeera, NHK...

142
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:13,369
All right.

143
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:16,408
Oh, God! This planet!

144
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:20,968
OK, Sarah, cover the snatch itself.

145
00:09:21,002 --> 00:09:22,471
Damon, public reaction. Meera,

146
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:25,088
the royal angle, upcoming marriage, etc.

147
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:27,299
Simon, set tone with
Standards and Practices.

148
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,765
We need to explain this without
viewers sicking up their Weetabix.

149
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:34,859
Ken, the internet aspect, new paradigm,
Twitter, Arab spring, all that.

150
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,595
Dan, all graphics run past me.
Keep it functional... no Peppa Pigs.

151
00:09:38,872 --> 00:09:41,447
Malaika, update the princess obit VT.

152
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:43,197
The Obit VT?

153
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,502
Mm-hm. First, an awkward phone
call. Least I can do is warn Tom.

154
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,018
We put a D Notice on it.

155
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:54,140
It's gone global, Tom.

156
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:56,419
Don't. I'm begging you.

157
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,419
Don't run it, Martin.

158
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,859
Look, I'm sorry. I can't help you.

159
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,298
You know how much help
you're getting hereon in?

160
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:07,338
Multiply nothing by
shit-all! UKN are dead for us!

161
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,425
Shove it up your arse you fucking...

162
00:10:10,096 --> 00:10:11,477
Interesting.

163
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:12,539
A man.

164
00:10:12,556 --> 00:10:13,477
Man?

165
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:14,511
A man!

166
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:17,460
Tom, so you're across it...

167
00:10:19,027 --> 00:10:20,746
I'm exploring contingency plans.

168
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,104
I briefed Callett.

169
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,020
Ah! Mr Callett. Noel, from Blue Eye.

170
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:34,040
Noel won an Emmy by his effects
work on that HBO moon Western thing.

171
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,498
Sea Of Tranquillity.

172
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:36,790
You won't find better.

173
00:10:36,806 --> 00:10:39,299
Can you map a head onto a body live?

174
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,540
Depends if your camera's moving.

175
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:45,909
Rule sheet specifies a single hand-held
camera in a constant roving motion.

176
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:47,253
Mm.

177
00:10:47,308 --> 00:10:50,362
Yeah, Gonzo style. He knows
his shit. That's tough.

178
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:53,690
"Fruition to be transmitted in full"?

179
00:10:54,456 --> 00:10:58,100
Focus on the visuals. Different
face mapped onto a live performer.

180
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:00,001
According to those stipulations.

181
00:11:00,462 --> 00:11:01,766
Fringes of possibility...

182
00:11:01,805 --> 00:11:04,876
Deadline's at four. We need to
know if it's workable by two.

183
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:10,580
Can't happen.

184
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:12,499
It has to.

185
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,419
Our embeds have ruled out the
major players. It's not AQ, not IRA.

186
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,196
This is what's left...
radicals, hate groups.

187
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,659
People who've threatened
yourself or the royals.

188
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,139
They're being pulled in as we speak.

189
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,712
For more than questioning, I hope.

190
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,775
Somebody know something.

191
00:11:33,965 --> 00:11:37,621
If we all do it more, there'll
be less waste lying around...

192
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,550
Is it still not on the telly?

193
00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:41,539
Nothing. Must be a hoax.

194
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,979
Or a black-out. Oh! Heads up!

195
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,339
Some major breaking news here on UKN.

196
00:11:48,356 --> 00:11:49,926
In the last two minutes

197
00:11:49,957 --> 00:11:53,308
It's been confirmed that
Susannah, Duchess of Beaumont

198
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,723
has been kidnapped.

199
00:11:54,754 --> 00:11:57,816
A video uploaded
anonymously to the Internet

200
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,354
appears to depict the
princess pleading for her life.

201
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:06,322
The video also contains a bizarre
ransom demand of a personal nature

202
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:10,299
involving the Prime Minister, and
a detailed list of instructions

203
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,659
relating to the
enactment of this demand.

204
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,486
As police round up potential suspects...

205
00:12:15,495 --> 00:12:16,963
... across the nation.

206
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,059
... This viewer video shows officers
raiding an address in Bradford.

207
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,900
A man thought to be
connected with a religious

208
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:27,739
pressure group, dragged
to a waiting van...

209
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,419
If it's terrorists,
they'll take her head off.

210
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,059
For fuck's sake, man! Just saying.

211
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,579
They'll be asking for a
million quid or something.

212
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,178
They want him to do it with a pig.

213
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:40,319
Demands...

214
00:12:40,381 --> 00:12:45,092
Telegraph has the whole video and an
interactive timeline. Tonally stark.

215
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:48,537
Brief mention of the ransom being
"a sex act". Nothing too gross.

216
00:12:48,577 --> 00:12:52,061
Sun runs with "Taken".
Big grab of Susannah...

217
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:53,620
Of course I still want that drink.

218
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:55,264
Then give me something.

219
00:12:55,272 --> 00:12:56,608
It's not...

220
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,548
That won't be possible.

221
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:01,928
I'm friendly when I drink.
Very friendly when I'm grateful.

222
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,804
There's no comment at this time

223
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:18,662
The Guardian are running
a fucking live blog

224
00:13:18,772 --> 00:13:23,019
and a short piece on the
historical symbolism of the pig.

225
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,139
... only five hours away,

226
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,259
UKN's Damon Brown analyses the
public reaction to the crisis.

227
00:13:31,296 --> 00:13:33,093
It's a day like no other.

228
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:36,549
The kidnap video has been
watched by over 18 million people.

229
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:40,707
Social networking sites are a...
buzz with 10,000 Tweets per minute.

230
00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:43,459
While we wait for
Downing Street to respond,

231
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,459
the nation is voicing its opinion.

232
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:51,259
I don't think anyone should concede
to any humiliation under threat.

233
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,379
I couldn't bear to watch that.

234
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,820
I won't be tuning in. Just
thinking about it is horrible.

235
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:59,592
That's disgusting. It is disgusting.

236
00:13:59,623 --> 00:14:02,339
It is disgusting but... after
that, he's gonna be hero.

237
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,931
People will look at him like he's
insane and take his position away.

238
00:14:06,978 --> 00:14:10,002
It will be hilarious to see that on TV.

239
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,419
Nothing too abnormal for MPs.

240
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,980
They're all sexual deviants,
all MPs and Prime Ministers.

241
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,420
We've been squeezing
hard, but nothing concrete.

242
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:25,677
It's my house! You can't...

243
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:29,982
You are in my doorway
touching my door handle!

244
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,860
Could I have a word?

245
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,018
It won't come to that.

246
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,180
And if they don't find her?

247
00:14:41,785 --> 00:14:43,379
MI5 have got a name.

248
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,538
They're surrounding the place now.

249
00:14:44,539 --> 00:14:45,575
Where?

250
00:14:45,607 --> 00:14:46,583
What?

251
00:14:46,614 --> 00:14:47,927
Where's the place?

252
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:49,083
Truro.

253
00:14:49,107 --> 00:14:50,591
- Why are you lying?
- What?

254
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:51,865
You're lying!

255
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,899
Truro? Jesus!

256
00:14:54,431 --> 00:14:56,270
I don't want you worrying.

257
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:58,176
You've never patronised
me. Don't start now.

258
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,098
Whoever this is, is insane.

259
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,578
And has a princess.

260
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:02,638
We'll get through this.

261
00:15:02,677 --> 00:15:05,153
Not any princess... the princess.

262
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,019
Princess bloody Facebook bloody
eco-conscious national sweetheart.

263
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,260
I won't have to do anything.

264
00:15:13,453 --> 00:15:14,811
Everyone's laughing at us.

265
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:15,894
You don't know that.

266
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:17,511
I know people.

267
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:19,214
We love humiliation.

268
00:15:19,223 --> 00:15:20,434
I can not laugh

269
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:21,730
Nothing is going to happen.

270
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,714
It's already happening in their heads.

271
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:29,500
In their heads, that's what you're
doing, what my husband is doing.

272
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,183
Please!

273
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,386
Jane.

274
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,121
I love you.

275
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:45,783
What?

276
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:47,620
Palace on the phone, sir.

277
00:15:47,621 --> 00:15:49,659
Get Alex to stall them.

278
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:52,699
She's already been speaking
to her for ten minutes.

279
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:54,501
"Her"?

280
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:55,988
It's the Queen herself.

281
00:15:58,599 --> 00:15:59,964
Go on.

282
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,566
As the 4pm deadline draws nearer,
the world holds its breath...

283
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,152
waiting to discover where the princess

284
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,871
Would they use a female pig?

285
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:17,613
It's on the list.

286
00:16:17,675 --> 00:16:20,581
List of rules, specifies
camera angles and things.

287
00:16:20,598 --> 00:16:22,043
Like dogme 95.

288
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,444
It's not like Dogme 95.

289
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:24,546
Exactly that.

290
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:25,939
What's Dogme 95?

291
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,300
Cinematic movement.

292
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:28,602
Lars von Trier.

293
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:29,868
Oh...

294
00:16:29,891 --> 00:16:32,490
Rules for a director...
no background music,

295
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,089
only natural light, for authenticity.

296
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,139
Same as these, so they can't cheat,
cut another guy's arse pumping away.

297
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:43,167
I can't think of anything
remotely like this.

298
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,690
A new form of terrorism...

299
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:50,199
It's not Islamist. To request
a pig is specifically abhorrent.

300
00:16:50,228 --> 00:16:52,832
That's the point! Make love to a pig!

301
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:54,473
Make love?

302
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,299
Steer them away from the grisly details.

303
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,259
Let's not dwell on any of the details.

304
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,699
This is already a huge
national talking point.

305
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:09,099
Isn't this precisely what whoever
is behind this is looking for?

306
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,139
How's Her Majesty taking it?

307
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,363
"I trust you'll do everything
in your power to get her back."

308
00:17:15,543 --> 00:17:16,939
And we are.

309
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,059
It wasn't a collective "you".
It was a singular "you", ie me.

310
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,899
Sir, we may have something. Jamie's
been tracing the video's origin.

311
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,215
I thought it was untraceable.

312
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:29,062
Technically, yes, so I thought,
"Work with what we do now"

313
00:17:29,063 --> 00:17:32,981
That video, before Youtube
compression it was 57.3 meg.

314
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,188
Algorithm.

315
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:39,661
Anyway, we also know it
was uploaded at 3:16 AM.

316
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,833
I ran a nationwide traceback
on uninterrupted one-way uploads

317
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:47,106
of precisely 57.3 meg in the
minutes leading up to 3:16,

318
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,826
and the closest I can get is a postcode.

319
00:17:49,842 --> 00:17:51,779
It came from somewhere in there.

320
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,935
Looks like a campus.

321
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:56,899
Yeah. Closed 2010.

322
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,579
It's been empty since.

323
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,659
Latest I-sat image on this area?

324
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,940
3 AM flyover shot from last night...

325
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,669
Looks like it had lights on.

326
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:12,310
We got him. We got him.

327
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,513
Alert the local team.
Full squad. I'll man it.

328
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:18,865
With helmet-cam relay. We
can watch the operation.

329
00:18:19,217 --> 00:18:20,732
Press office, OK, Tom?

330
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,654
Yes!

331
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,279
Right. Confident?

332
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,439
It's a kick-bollock scramble, but
with finessing it should be OK.

333
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,760
Finesse quickly. Our
performer's on his way.

334
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,319
It's a new one for me, obviously.
I wouldn't normally... You know.

335
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,319
You seen any of my films?

336
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,214
No.

337
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,206
I'm pretty trad... bish,
bash, bosh. In, out.

338
00:18:54,254 --> 00:18:55,863
Yeah, well...

339
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:58,199
What do I put on the invoice?
That's what I'm wondering.

340
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,490
There won't be any invoicing.

341
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:02,716
- Oi-oi, Rod!
- Oi-oi!

342
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:07,119
Need to prep two statements

343
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,598
Good outcome. Bad outcome.

344
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,823
Rescue operation?

345
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:12,776
Goon squad's heading for
postcode in Buckinghamshire.

346
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,920
HP84TD, a college or something.
They should be there by now.

347
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,959
Yeah, I've reduced the luminance...

348
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:46,319
Agent Callett, this is Mr Flynn.

349
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,599
AKA, Rod Senseless.

350
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,072
Stage name.

351
00:19:52,736 --> 00:19:54,399
Yeah. Well...

352
00:19:54,953 --> 00:19:56,519
You need to get into this.

353
00:19:56,554 --> 00:19:58,367
Is there a dressing room I can use?

354
00:19:58,399 --> 00:19:59,720
No.

355
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:01,639
Where's my co-star?

356
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,945
Be rude not to give
her a kiss beforehand.

357
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:06,304
Outside in the truck.

358
00:20:07,362 --> 00:20:09,046
Full of joie de vivre, isn't he?

359
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,960
You also need to wear
this... on your head.

360
00:20:23,914 --> 00:20:26,568
Board's been prised away.
That's where they got in.

361
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:27,914
OK.

362
00:20:28,398 --> 00:20:29,880
Target identified.

363
00:20:29,913 --> 00:20:31,093
Commissioner. Thank you.

364
00:20:31,117 --> 00:20:32,617
So, team red...

365
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:33,812
Any orders, boss?

366
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:36,070
Continue reconnaissance
and await instructions,

367
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,508
before you proceed.

368
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,786
With the 4pm deadline three hours away,

369
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:41,645
time is running out for
the Prime Minister...

370
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,520
They got in, yeah?

371
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,981
Do you think I'd be here if they had?

372
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,466
We've got statements for either outcome.

373
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,026
Listen, coverage is very sympathetic.

374
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:05,823
Can't think about coverage now!

375
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:13,764
But it's on-side?

376
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:16,263
Strong undercurrent of sympathy.

377
00:21:16,302 --> 00:21:19,170
Every poll indicates
understanding, disgust with the

378
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:22,038
captor, outrage at the
whole thing, but not at you.

379
00:21:26,515 --> 00:21:29,803
If Walker's team fuck up, I'm not
saying they will, but if they do,

380
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,320
the public anticipates non-compliance.

381
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:37,529
There'll be squawks from the usuals,

382
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:41,710
but it's not "England expects".

383
00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:52,311
If he kills her, there's no
blood on your hands. Bottom line.

384
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,397
With hours to go, time is running
out for the security services.

385
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:03,959
Joining us is actress Lydia...

386
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:05,799
Thought this was coming from IB7.

387
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,865
We trimmed the edges
so it's coming direct.

388
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,559
Twinkle tits from?

389
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,719
Actress, Downton Abbey,
knows the princess.

390
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,865
This came for you, left at reception.

391
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:20,760
Courier dropped it off.

392
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,280
Know how to plug this in?

393
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,879
Jack, call the police. Take it!

394
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,039
Get someone to shoot that first.

395
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,080
What the fuck is this?

396
00:22:42,469 --> 00:22:44,907
I gave you rules. I said no cheating.

397
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,799
Some more breaking news,

398
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,799
and a severed finger, thought
to belong to Princess Susannah,

399
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,319
has been delivered to
UKN, along with a video

400
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,639
apparently showing the kidnapper
removing it from the princess.

401
00:23:09,827 --> 00:23:13,509
UKN News has passed all
material to Scotland Yard...

402
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:15,080
Fucking hell!

403
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:19,728
Oh, God! I can't watch this!
He's got to do what they want.

404
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:21,239
Yes, he fucking has!

405
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,560
... Which contained a statement

406
00:23:23,644 --> 00:23:27,918
accusing Downing Street of
attempting to break the rules

407
00:23:27,943 --> 00:23:30,334
This grim development comes just hours

408
00:23:30,377 --> 00:23:32,498
before the 4PM deadline...

409
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,440
Jesus!

410
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,959
Unless I'm mistaken,
our mystery man specified

411
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,001
no visual trickery in his
original demand, didn't he?

412
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:50,970
I considered it necessary...

413
00:23:51,002 --> 00:23:52,306
Considered it necessary.

414
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,635
To divise...

415
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,369
FUCKING HELL!

416
00:24:01,345 --> 00:24:02,654
- Mike... !
- Don't!

417
00:24:02,686 --> 00:24:04,004
It's nor...

418
00:24:04,012 --> 00:24:07,111
One word, I swear I will fucking... !

419
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,852
What did you do, Alex?

420
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:23,579
I had a back-up plan.

421
00:24:24,303 --> 00:24:26,570
A man prepared to do it
and an FX company that

422
00:24:26,571 --> 00:24:28,837
would paint your head
onto his shoulders.

423
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,438
You actually thought that would work?

424
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:31,923
I believed it worth considering.

425
00:24:32,026 --> 00:24:33,719
Then you're a stupid bitch.

426
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,199
With your interest at heart.

427
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,594
Who knew about this?

428
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:41,563
A select few. It seems
some idiot at the studio

429
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,063
recognised our designated performer,

430
00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:47,422
Tweeted a photo and the
online hivemind did the maths.

431
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,032
It's not playing well.

432
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,969
With who?

433
00:24:53,445 --> 00:24:55,421
With, er... anyone.

434
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,523
A few hours ago, public opinion
was behind Prime Minister Callow,

435
00:24:59,555 --> 00:25:02,156
with only 28% of the public believing

436
00:25:02,192 --> 00:25:04,960
he should fulfil the
bizarre and illegal request.

437
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,210
In the wake of these images,

438
00:25:07,263 --> 00:25:12,183
and the delivery of the princess's
finger, the mood is shifting.

439
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,803
It'll be humiliating, but
nothing compared to her suffering.

440
00:25:15,827 --> 00:25:17,350
With the appearance of finger...

441
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:18,506
He's just got to do it.

442
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,413
Yes, he has to do it.

443
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:20,817
What's the alternative?

444
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:23,732
We can get another Prime Minister.
We can't live without a princess.

445
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,163
Of course...

446
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:28,799
If he doesn't get her released,
he's finished, isn't he?

447
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,208
Online polls suggest that 86% of voters

448
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,879
now believe the demand should be met.

449
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,880
Damon Brown...

450
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,678
When are Walker's team
hitting the college?

451
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,800
They need time...

452
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:44,759
No more pissing around.

453
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,160
Julian's advising against...

454
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:49,999
I'm advising for. They
go in now. They go in now.

455
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,079
Where's my obit VT?

456
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,519
What would you say if I said I was
near where Susannah's being held?

457
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,064
I'd say bullshit.

458
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:17,078
Then you'd be wrong.

459
00:26:18,564 --> 00:26:20,104
Have you got a crew with you?

460
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,736
I'm not stupid.

461
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:24,096
Malaika?

462
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,768
Hello?

463
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,719
Are you getting this?

464
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,600
Yeah. Don't put yourself in any danger.

465
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,520
Still getting this?

466
00:26:52,521 --> 00:26:55,920
Yeah. Just stay safe,
Malaika. Be careful!

467
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,800
If this doesn't work...

468
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,920
we need...

469
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,240
Armed police! Lay down on the
floor! Lay down on the floor!

470
00:27:48,002 --> 00:27:50,200
Move!

471
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,720
Fuck!

472
00:28:01,933 --> 00:28:03,972
It's a decoy.

473
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:08,770
They must have bounced the upload
from here with a proxy. I'm sorry.

474
00:28:08,842 --> 00:28:10,091
Jesus!

475
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,396
They're looking right at her!

476
00:28:11,451 --> 00:28:12,872
They can't see her.

477
00:28:12,973 --> 00:28:14,115
Malaika, make sure they can't...

478
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:15,747
Stay down! Don't move!

479
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,840
Run, Malaika! Run!

480
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,639
Get out of there. Come on!

481
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,600
Armed police!

482
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,425
Is it him?

483
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:42,449
Where the fuck is Jack?

484
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,239
Advance! Advance! Advance!

485
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:50,304
Get down!

486
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,238
Get down!

487
00:28:53,287 --> 00:28:57,486
UKN. It's Malaika something
or other. She's from UKN.

488
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,800
- You press?
- Yes.

489
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,879
There goes your RTS Award.

490
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,959
There must be something.

491
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,788
There's nothing there, Mike.

492
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,119
There'll be a clue. Some evidence.

493
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,160
We've done all we can.

494
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:10,599
You rescued mannequin.

495
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:11,507
I'm sorry, Michael...

496
00:29:11,531 --> 00:29:12,634
Fuck off, Julian!

497
00:29:12,675 --> 00:29:14,298
20 past three. We're out of time.

498
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:16,290
We're not out of time!

499
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:18,415
We're not out of time.

500
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,159
It's not going to happen.

501
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,678
To the public...

502
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:37,560
Fuck the public!

503
00:29:37,561 --> 00:29:42,439
To the public, this would be one
man of questionable popularity

504
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,680
putting personal embarrassment
over the life of a girl.

505
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:46,919
They will not release her anyway.
She's probably already dead.

506
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,836
If she isn't, he'll kill
her and upload the video.

507
00:29:50,763 --> 00:29:54,499
Everyone will see it.
The world will see it.

508
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,819
The mood will border on insurrection
and you will be destroyed,

509
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,940
I guarantee you... utterly destroyed.

510
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:06,545
The polling bears that out.

511
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:13,779
You won't just be a
disgraced politician,

512
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,899
The public, the Palace and
the Party insist on compliance.

513
00:30:18,907 --> 00:30:20,159
Fuck the Party!

514
00:30:20,168 --> 00:30:22,946
Refuse, and I've been advised

515
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,579
that we cannot guarantee
your physical safety.

516
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:29,222
Or that of your family.

517
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:32,809
But...

518
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,683
I've made arrangements
for the broadcast.

519
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:48,000
I can't...

520
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:50,847
I'm sorry, Michael.
It's out of your hands.

521
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,579
Let's take you live to the
scene in central London.

522
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,419
As we see the Prime Minister's
car travelling across London...

523
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,126
He's got to do it.

524
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:09,252
The world's bloody broken.

525
00:31:09,337 --> 00:31:13,340
... Appears to be heading
west to Bankside Studios.

526
00:31:46,593 --> 00:31:49,392
We've ratified the
law... after midnight,

527
00:31:49,447 --> 00:31:53,614
it'll be a criminal of fence to store
any recording or images of the event.

528
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,962
They're doing an announcement
to warn people off

529
00:32:00,963 --> 00:32:03,864
even watching, some sonic
tone that causes nausea.

530
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:09,899
... When public opinion
has very much hardened,

531
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,364
following the delivery of
the princess's severed finger.

532
00:32:13,914 --> 00:32:17,981
As the 4pm deadline approaches,
the nation is at a stand still

533
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,899
watching the extraordinary
situation play out.

534
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:25,779
Just to remind you, this is now
a story of global significance...

535
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:29,459
"Michael Callow has
displayed incredible bravery

536
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,220
in what was a matter of life or death."

537
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,449
That's how it opens,
then we should move on...

538
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,060
OK. Yeah.

539
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:40,654
Everything prepared?

540
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,786
Yes, ma'am.

541
00:32:41,817 --> 00:32:42,974
It's sedated?

542
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,394
Injection. It's docile.

543
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,340
It's time to go in now.

544
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,219
... An unprecedented nature.

545
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,482
This is an official announcement.

546
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:06,966
In a few minutes,

547
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:10,284
the Prime Minister will perform
an indecent act on your screens.

548
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:18,099
... in the hope that it will ensure
the release of Princess Susannah.

549
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,872
Recording or possessing a copy of
this broadcast will become illegal

550
00:33:21,881 --> 00:33:22,966
at midnight.

551
00:33:23,013 --> 00:33:26,621
All viewers are advised to turn
off their televisions immediately.

552
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,419
The broadcast will commence
after the following tone.

553
00:34:03,817 --> 00:34:05,794
We're complying with
the stipulated rules.

554
00:34:05,856 --> 00:34:07,981
You'll have to keep going...

555
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,100
you'll have to see
it through to the end.

556
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:21,259
We've placed visual aids in your
eyeline, which might help if you...

557
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,260
get into trouble.

558
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:29,507
The suggestion we're
getting from psychologists

559
00:34:29,564 --> 00:34:32,327
is that you should take
as long as you need.

560
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,939
If you rush, it might be
misinterpreted as eagerness

561
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,180
or even enjoyment.

562
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,085
It's just a skeleton crew inside.

563
00:34:58,107 --> 00:34:59,686
Closed set.

564
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,540
There he is!

565
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,963
I trust this will bring about the
safe return of Princess Susannah.

566
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:06,861
I...

567
00:36:13,098 --> 00:36:14,947
I love my wife.

568
00:36:18,665 --> 00:36:20,283
May God forgive me.

569
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,459
Oh, no!

570
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,180
Jesus! Poor bastard!

571
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,619
But it's been on for nearly an hour.

572
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,980
It's history, this.

573
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,419
We've got her. Susannah.

574
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,340
They released her?

575
00:39:33,341 --> 00:39:36,178
Stumbling about in the city.

576
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,673
Sedated. She can't remember
anything, but she's unharmed.

577
00:39:39,697 --> 00:39:41,009
But her finger?

578
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:43,059
Not hers. DNA shows it's male.

579
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,065
What?

580
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:49,386
There is one other thing. There's
a CCTV grab of her from half three.

581
00:39:49,432 --> 00:39:53,619
It seems he let her go 30
minutes before it happened.

582
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:56,176
Why?

583
00:39:56,325 --> 00:39:57,833
My guess...

584
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,434
he knew everyone would be elsewhere

585
00:39:59,489 --> 00:40:01,692
watching screens.

586
00:40:03,132 --> 00:40:04,743
So it's a statement.

587
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,157
Ma'am?

588
00:40:06,172 --> 00:40:09,292
That's what this was all
about, making a point.

589
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,180
Should we, er... ?

590
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:13,249
Lose that page of the report.

591
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:15,819
No-one sees it, especially the PM.

592
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,820
Of course.

593
00:40:27,362 --> 00:40:28,873
Good news, Michael.

594
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,546
You saved her.
Susannah's alive and well.

595
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,419
On the one-year anniversary
of his humiliating ordeal,

596
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:32,539
an apparently unconcerned Michael
Callow put in an assured performance

597
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,687
at a public appearance,
accompanied by his wife Jane.

598
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:36,977
Here I go.

599
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:38,079
OK.

600
00:41:38,449 --> 00:41:41,008
Oh!

601
00:41:41,907 --> 00:41:45,609
The other central figure in
events was also before the camera

602
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,019
at last night's Children
Of Valour Awards.

603
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,819
Princess Susannah made
her first public appearance

604
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,703
since announcing her pregnancy.

605
00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:57,579
It was one year ago that the
Turner Prize-winning artist,

606
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,914
Carlton Bloom,

607
00:41:58,948 --> 00:42:02,226
coerced the Prime Minister
into committing an indecent act.

608
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:08,626
As the anniversary arrived, one
art critic caused controversy

609
00:42:08,657 --> 00:42:12,659
by describing it as "the first
great artwork of the 21st century".

610
00:42:13,151 --> 00:42:16,990
While cultural commentators
debate its significance,

611
00:42:17,038 --> 00:42:19,259
with a global audience of 1.3 billion,

612
00:42:19,322 --> 00:42:21,837
it was an event in which
we all participated.

613
00:42:21,953 --> 00:42:25,140
However, the incident failed
to destroy a Prime Minister,

614
00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:29,499
who holds an approval rating
three points higher than last year.

615
00:42:29,607 --> 00:42:31,929
Damon Brown, UKN.

616
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,220
Jane.

617
00:42:39,414 --> 00:42:41,054
Jane, please.
