10
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,480
- Hey, Mum.
- I was worried. It's almost six.

11
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,680
I took a detour after Luss
to show Pia the pretty way.

12
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,520
I slept through it. Hi.

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,520
Pia, Mum. Mum, Pia.

14
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,000
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
Janet.

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,120
- Pretty wee thing you've captured.
- Mum!

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,280
Hey, I'm flattered. Thank you.

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,080
- I like your accent.
- Ditto.

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,760
What was that, love?

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,760
Ditto.

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,200
Uh, "ditto."

22
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,320
Oh!

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,080
So, did you grow up in America?
Or are you originally from...

24
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,280
Jesus, Mum!

25
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,600
US, born and bred.

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,320
Okay.

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,480
I hope you're both hungry.

28
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,400
- Yeah.
- Starving.

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,880
Who's the pianist?

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,040
Dad was.

31
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,800
- Is that him?
- Aye. Kenneth.

32
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,960
"Kenny," Mum called him.

33
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,040
Is it creepy if I say
he looks good in that cap?

34
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,440
A bit. Yeah.

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,040
Tomorrow, we'll show Pia
around the village,

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,080
and then we'll probably
set off Monday morning.

37
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,880
- You're only staying two nights?
- Well, we've got to head on to Rùm.

38
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,240
To shoot, uh, my film...

39
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,080
<i>Our... </i>our film.

40
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,760
Uh, about the rare egg guy.

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,280
So, that's what your documentary's about?
This egg collector from Rùm?

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,840
He's not a collector. He...

43
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,920
he guards rare eggs
against collectors who want to steal them.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,960
It's, uh, it's a big trade.

45
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,400
The way I see it,
this is going to be a story

46
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,560
about one of the last remaining holdouts
against the commodification of nature.

47
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,880
Not about a man who watches eggs?

48
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,360
Well, yeah, but it...

49
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,760
He's like a vigilante.

50
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,560
A guardian angel.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,640
Egg theft is illegal,

52
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,240
but the local cops aren't interested,
or they're too lazy.

53
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,440
I mean...

54
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,800
Maybe if someone who looked like me
were stealing the eggs...

55
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,600
They're probably just overstretched.
Policing's a very demanding job.

56
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,120
As your dad knew.

57
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,960
- Mm.
- Yeah. I mean...

58
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Yeah.

59
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,200
I saw that photo of him in uniform,

60
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,240
and 20 minutes later,
I'm shit-mouthing the cops? Like...

61
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
She hates me.

62
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,680
- No, she doesn't. She likes you.
- She said that?

63
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,600
It's just, anything with Dad...

64
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,480
She's sensitive. She misses him.

65
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,240
Well, of course. I mean, you must too.

66
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
In theory.

67
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Sort of do.

68
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,360
I was eight when he died,

69
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,000
so most of my life,
he's just been a few photographs.

70
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
Mm.

71
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
He was ill quite a while before he died.

72
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,360
Uh, needed a lot of caring, you know.

73
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,040
I think that really took it out of Mum.

74
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,640
Whole place was a lot quieter
from then on.

75
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,000
Seriously, are you hard right now?

76
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
I am.

77
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
That is...

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,760
...totally inappropriate.

79
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,520
I'm so, so sorry.

80
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,760
Does that thing work?

81
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,720
Uh, last time I checked.

82
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,800
No tape. Boo.

83
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,160
- What were you gonna film with it?
- Here. Watch.

84
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,080
You okay? Good to go?

85
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,240
What's "<i>Burgerack"</i>?

86
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,000
<i>Bergerac. </i>Old detective show.

87
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,480
Your folks were seriously into it.

88
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,080
That's a whole lot of <i>Bergerac</i>.

89
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,880
Uh, Mum had a crush on John Nettles.

90
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,240
The... the guy who played Bergerac.
She used to say he had a nice bum.

91
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,800
I do not wanna think about your mom
getting wet over some dude's butt.

92
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,560
Well, he did have a nice one.

93
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
You heading out?

94
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,520
Just taking Pia to the loch.

95
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,120
Might get windy.
I can fill you a thermos with some tea.

96
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,360
- It's no bother, Mum.
- Well...

97
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,640
Have a nice time.

98
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,960
- It's okay.
- We should leave now.

99
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,840
It's like something from a painting.

100
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,200
That's because
people paint landscapes.

101
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,240
I mean, this place is amazing.
I can't believe it's so empty.

102
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,960
We're the only ones here. It's weird.

103
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,360
Davis McCardle.

104
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,160
I told you
never to show your face in here again.

105
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,120
You can walk right back out that door <i>now!</i>

106
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,080
Hello, Stuart.

107
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,600
How are you doing, you fucking wank?

108
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,960
Hey! What the fuck is with that hair, eh?
You gonna tell me your pronouns?

109
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,200
I just let it grow a bit. You know?

110
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,920
I thought you were in London,
studying woke film theory,

111
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,120
or whatever you call it.

112
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,680
Someday, this guy will be polishing BAFTAs

113
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,840
and forgetting about us poor wee shites
he used to cut about with.

114
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,880
Years ago, Stuart made a model
for my short video.

115
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,120
A spaceship.

116
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,136
- Yeah, a <i>Solaris </i>tribute.
- With a working engine.

117
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,040
You get the picture.

118
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,040
Said if he ended up
making the next <i>Star Wars,</i>

119
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,920
I'd help out with the special effects,
but he's, uh...

120
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,000
he's turned his back on us old gadgies
now he's down the big town, eh?

121
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,480
- See, he's not even introducing you to me.
- Oh, sorry.

122
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,480
This is Pia.

123
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,720
- She was in my film course as well.
- Oh!

124
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,520
- Oh, <i>your </i>course, was it?
- No.

125
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,560
He thinks they're gonna name it
after him someday.

126
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,776
Well, I thought they were gonna name it
after me, so...

127
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,840
Yes, well, that would be
the smart move, eh?

128
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,080
What with fucking diversity and all that.

129
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,120
Uh, three pints on the house. No charge.

130
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Crisps all around?

131
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,600
It's a shame he's dragged you
out of London up to this ghost town, eh?

132
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,040
All the holiday atmosphere of a hospice.

133
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,520
You're still in business.

134
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,960
Skin of the teeth, man. Look around.

135
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,160
We are on our arse.

136
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,640
I keep telling Dad
if things don't pick up,

137
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,760
we'll just have to bite the bullet
and jack it fucking in.

138
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Speak of the cunt.

139
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,520
- What are you doing?
- Well, I sh... I should say hello.

140
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,080
No, no, don't bother.

141
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,520
That'll be his fifth refill today.

142
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,920
The only reason
he comes downstairs these days.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Christ.

144
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,560
Oh, there he goes.

145
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Up to his pit.

146
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,880
Is he... is he depressed, or...

147
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,440
Of course he's depressed.

148
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,360
There used to be three pubs around here.

149
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,200
And now we're the last man standing.
It's a...

150
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,480
it's a proper dead zone.

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,760
I don't get it.
It's so beautiful around here. I...

152
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,880
How are you not overrun with tourists?

153
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,240
'Cause of Iain Adair.

154
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,920
Who is Iain Adair?

155
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,400
- You didn't tell her about Iain Adair?
- Come on.

156
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,280
- It's... it's a bit...
- Who is Iain Adair?

157
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,880
Okay, okay, fine. So...

158
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,680
Iain Adair was a guy who lived
up at Five Acres Farm on the hill there

159
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,840
with his mum and dad.

160
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,600
People said he was quiet, easily led,
not too bright. All of that, you know?

161
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,800
But really, he was just some local guy.

162
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,280
- Anyway...
- Turned out he tortured and killed people.

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,280
I was building up to that.

164
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,000
I haven't got your storytelling instincts.
You tell it.

165
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,760
- No, you spoiled it now.
- No, not the end bit with your dad.

166
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,640
- What end bit with your dad?
- Can I just start from the beginning?

167
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,560
Yeah, just pretend
you don't know the murder stuff yet.

168
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,720
- Sure.
- Okay.

169
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
So,

170
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
picture it.

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,280
<i>There used to be loads
of holidaymakers here.</i>

172
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
<i>Loads of them.</i>

173
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,680
<i>In 1997, this couple in their twenties
hire a cottage for their honeymoon.</i>

174
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,160
<i>Back when we still had tourists.</i>

175
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,600
<i>Sorry.</i>

176
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,320
- <i>They were here for about a week.</i>
<i>- Mr. Smiley.</i>

177
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,720
<i>Loads of people saw them</i>.

178
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,800
Dad said they drank in here
a couple of nights.

179
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,616
<i>Come the end of the week,
they're supposed to have left.</i>

180
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,680
The cleaner comes to get their cottage
ready for the next booking.

181
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,680
Their car's parked outside.

182
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,720
<i>And all their stuff's still there.</i>

183
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,280
No sign of them. Gone.

184
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,960
- Creepy.
- Very creepy.

185
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,880
- So, of course, Dad gets called in.
- His dad was a local policeman.

186
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,560
- Aye, she knows that.
- Oh. Okay, sorry.

187
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,440
<i>So, Dad's asking around, right?
Knocking on doors.</i>

188
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,920
<i>This couple is nowhere to be found.</i>

189
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,280
<i>Vanished off the face of the earth
and all that.</i>

190
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,200
<i>After a day or two,
it becomes a big story.</i>

191
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
<i>Mm.</i>

192
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,696
<i>Tabloids pick it up.</i>

193
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,120
<i>Place is swarming with journalists.
It's a frenzy.</i>

194
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,480
<i>But then weeks go by,
and there's no sign of them. Nothing.</i>

195
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,720
And then Princess Diana died. You know?

196
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,840
Papers moved onto that.
Story fizzles out. Finished.

197
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,280
Until one day...

198
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
One night.

199
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Mm.

200
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,280
Iain Adair's drinking in here.

201
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,160
- In here?
- He drank in here all the time.

202
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,760
Always sat right there.

203
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,960
<i>Anyway, this night,</i>

204
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,480
<i>he's had way more than usual.</i>

205
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,360
<i>People say he's talking weird.</i>

206
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,960
<i>He's making a nuisance of himself.</i>

207
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,560
<i>There's a poster of the missing couple
on the wall.</i>

208
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,560
He even makes comments about the girl.
And your dad...

209
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,480
Yeah, the auld pissheid,
he tells Iain he's barred.

210
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,360
Iain tells him to fuck off.

211
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,560
<i>Says he's got half a mind
to come back and shoot the place up.</i>

212
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
<i>Nice.</i>

213
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,720
Dad's worried now 'cause Iain's a farmer.
He's got a shotgun.

214
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,360
So, Dad asks Kenneth, his dad,

215
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,640
to go and check in on Iain,
have a word with him.

216
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,200
- So then Dad...
- His dad, Kenneth.

217
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,560
- Of course it's my dad.
- Sorry.

218
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,480
<i>Dad drives up to Five Acres.</i>

219
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,680
<i>Knocks on the door.</i>

220
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,440
<i>Says, "I just wanna talk to you," etc.</i>

221
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,840
<i>Iain doesn't answer.</i>

222
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,440
Dad's walking back to his car
when Iain opens the upstairs window and...

223
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
shoots him.

224
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,240
Sorry. He shot your dad?

225
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,640
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

226
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,720
- Not fatally, in the shoulder. Bad though.
- Holy shit.

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,760
<i>So Dad, crawling back to his car,
calls for backup,</i>

228
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,440
<i>when, from inside the house...</i>

229
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Bang! Bang! Bang!

230
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,000
Then nothing.

231
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
<i>Backup arrives.</i>

232
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
<i>They go in.</i>

233
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,880
Iain Adair shot his mum and dad,
then himself.

234
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,720
Total wipeout.

235
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,360
- Farmicide.
- Mm.

236
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,160
While they're looking around the farm,

237
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,240
they check out the cellar.

238
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
Oh God.

239
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,520
<i>Behind a wardrobe,
there's a hidden door leading to a bunker.</i>

240
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,880
- Old WWII, or '60s, or something.
- Here we go.

241
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,960
<i>And inside,
it's like a torture room.</i>

242
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,840
This guy had been abducting people.

243
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,320
<i>Keeping them down there and doing
God knows what for weeks at a time.</i>

244
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,880
<i>And then burying the bodies
out in the fields.</i>

245
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,560
The honeymoon couple?

246
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,080
- Fuck me, and the rest of them.
- The rest?

247
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,960
<i>Around here, the countryside
can be pretty dangerous.</i>

248
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,880
<i>There's deep water and all that, you know?</i>

249
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,240
<i>Sometimes, people went missing.</i>

250
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,920
<i>Walker takes a wrong turn, you know?</i>

251
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,160
<i>Someone rents a kayak
and doesn't come back.</i>

252
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,880
Over the years,
nobody was really totting it all up.

253
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,760
- How many we talking about?
- Eight.

254
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,080
Oh.

255
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,000
All been tortured.

256
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,480
And the rest of it.
Dark sex things. Really extreme stuff.

257
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,480
- Yeah. Okay.
- It'd give you nightmares.

258
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,600
So...

259
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,800
Yeah, that was Iain Adair.

260
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,640
That is a lot.

261
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,896
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

262
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,760
And as you can imagine,
it doesn't look great on TripAdvisor.

263
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
End result?

264
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,600
Fuck-all visitors.

265
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,400
- Didn't just shit in his victims' mouths.
- Don't know he did that.

266
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,840
He shat on the tourist trade too.

267
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,080
But your dad, he recovered.

268
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,120
- I mean...
- Well, his injuries weren't that bad.

269
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,280
- He was in hospital a couple of weeks.
- Right.

270
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,680
But while he was in there, he got MRSA.

271
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,880
And that killed him over time.

272
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,480
So, far as Mum's concerned,
Iain Adair killed Dad too.

273
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
Well...

274
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,000
- She's not wrong.
- Aye.

275
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,960
- Another pint?
- Aye.

276
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
Magda!

277
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Three pints.

278
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,080
Can we go see where it happened?

279
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,680
It's perfect.

280
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
You don't see it?

281
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,920
- See what?
- Can we get in there?

282
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,720
No. It's boarded up. There's planks.
Why would we wanna get in there?

283
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,880
Because. This is what our film
should be about.

284
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
All of this.

285
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,320
What? This?

286
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
Wha...

287
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,280
Quaint little village,

288
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,680
but for years, this Hannibal Lecter dude
has been operating a death den?

289
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,280
At the heart of it? I mean, it's a story.

290
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,680
- It's an actual story.
- Are you serious?

291
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,120
- Well, yeah.
- But...

292
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,120
- We're meeting the egg guy on Wednesday.
- Fuck the egg guy. I'm sorry. Come on.

293
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,160
Come on!

294
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,920
You said you liked the egg idea.

295
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
Oh, babe.

296
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,280
I kinda liked it.

297
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,920
Just like I kinda like plain pasta
in a pinch. But I love this.

298
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,080
I love it!

299
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,080
So, um...

300
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,360
A... a true crime film about Iain Adair?

301
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,440
We can pitch
to production companies, who will fund it.

302
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,920
I had a meeting with Kate Cezar
at Historik. She might go for this.

303
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,440
- People know the story.
- I didn't.

304
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,560
I mean, it's not a whodunit.
There's no mystery.

305
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,880
Are you nuts?

306
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,760
The mystery is,
"How could someone do that shit?"

307
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,120
It's "What the fuck?"
It's "Give me the details."

308
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,320
And the details are so awful,
it is irresistible.

309
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,440
- Sounds tacky.
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

310
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,680
We won't let it be.

311
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,440
It'll be a... a solid piece.

312
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,040
Well-made, high-end.

313
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,960
And it's exploring
the biggest topic, life and death.

314
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,120
It's just not the kind of thing
I want us to make. Okay?

315
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,720
Well, then, what do you want to make?

316
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,960
A meditation on the Egg Man of Rùm

317
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,760
that will maybe play at a festival

318
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,080
and maybe be admired
by a couple dozen documentary nerds?

319
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,360
Or something that people will watch?

320
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,720
Something they actually want to see!

321
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,320
If you don't wanna make it, I will.

322
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,720
Iain Adair shot my dad.

323
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,720
He died, Pia.

324
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,640
He fucking died.

325
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,880
- That's real. That's not fucking content.
- Of course. That's not what I meant.

326
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,360
It'd dredge up so much shit for Mum.
She lost her husband.

327
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,160
Okay, okay, and we can make that point.
Her point.

328
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,280
He was a victim too.

329
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,240
You said that he's been forgotten
in all of this.

330
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,360
It was so good. Thank you.

331
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,880
Did you not like the <i>dauphinoise?</i>

332
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,680
Uh, I just try to limit my carbs.

333
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,520
But what I had was delicious.

334
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,360
Oh.

335
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
Good.

336
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,280
We would do it justice.

337
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,680
It would feel and look professional.

338
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,120
Babe.

339
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,920
It's a brilliant idea.

340
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,520
Visual showcase. Bring the tourists back.

341
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,440
What was the name of that Netflix thing?
About the guy that killed women?

342
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,400
Maybe narrow that down.

343
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,480
One of them,
he ate her own eye in front of her.

344
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,360
<i>The Waltonville Claw</i>.

345
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,880
So, half this show
was just amazing, constant footage

346
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,920
of Waltonville, forests and mountains,

347
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,600
fucking waterfalls!

348
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,520
Looked like a brochure.

349
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,240
Yeah, my cousin actually booked a holiday
just off how it looked.

350
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,320
Hm.

351
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,280
He said the place was fucking heaving
when he got there.

352
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,440
Cunts get a load of this place
on their 4K fucking flat screens

353
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,320
and they will be crawling all over us
like flies on dog shite,

354
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
but with money.

355
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,320
I've even got a drone you can use.

356
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,080
- Opening shot.
- Moody piano chord. I love it.

357
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,800
- Of course you've got a drone.
- Of course you're a cunt about it.

358
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
Ah!

359
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,040
I've got something even better.

360
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Wait there.

361
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
Hang on.

362
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,320
- Okay.
- Yes!

363
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,720
This is my mum's curiosity box.

364
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,760
She was fucking obsessed
with the whole thing. Obsessed.

365
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,880
My dad fucking hated it.

366
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,920
This is a whole archive.

367
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,480
I'd call it
a morbidly obsessive collection.

368
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,240
Man, he looks creepy.

369
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,840
It's not every day one of your regulars
turns out to be Vlad the fucking Impaler.

370
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,040
- She was bound to want a souvenir.
- Will she mind if we borrow it?

371
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,640
She won't give a fuck.
She's been dead for four years.

372
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,840
We can hook this up.

373
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,640
Mum's Stone Age VCR.

374
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,160
Yeah. Ooh!

375
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,040
It's got a tape in it.

376
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,320
Mm.

377
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,120
Of course.

378
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,240
Hey, that's your mom's boyfriend.

379
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,560
- Show us his butt.
- I think that's enough of that.

380
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,000
Pass us one of Stu's tapes.

381
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,000
Should we dive in?

382
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,840
<i>It's four days
since Dawn and Simon Challis</i>

383
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,440
<i>were last seen alive</i>

384
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,120
<i>in the tourist hotspot of Loch Henry,</i>

385
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,840
<i>the holiday cottage they'd rented
left eerily abandoned.</i>

386
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,000
<i>Yet, despite extensive searches
of the local area...</i>

387
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,920
That's Dad!

388
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,160
<i>...still no sign of the missing couple.</i>

389
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,360
<i>Locals are mystified.</i>

390
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,616
<i>- It all seems quite odd.</i>
- That's Stuart's dad.

391
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,840
<i>Everybody's worried.</i>

392
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,840
<i>I mean, Dawn, the missing girl,
is very attractive, so...</i>

393
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,320
Objectified much?

394
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,600
<i>- Everybody's hoping they'll be okay.</i>
- Jeez.

395
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,760
You should've asked.

396
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
About what?

397
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
All that

398
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,800
stuff of your mum's that you gave
to Janet's boy for his film or whatever.

399
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,720
Ah, keep your blouse on.
You'll get it back.

400
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,880
- Shouldn't be making movies about it.
- Fuck me, movies.

401
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,480
Christ.

402
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Whoa.

403
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,440
Sorry. Sorry.

404
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,600
- A bit close, babe.
- No, it's okay.

405
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,760
Davis!

406
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400

Shot at the cops.

431
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,360
Shot his parents. Shot himself.

432
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,200
But, of course,
that was just scratching the surface.

433
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,400
What they found underneath his farmhouse
was even worse.

434
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,640
Fucking horrible.

435
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,720
Okay. Uh, can we just go back
to the part where you...

436
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,680
What the fuck was that?

437
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,120
- Probably broken. Stop touching it!
- Ambulance is on the way.

438
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,880
- You'll be all right, Mr. King.
- Fuck off me! You fuck off, you parasite!

439
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,400
You fucking insect!

440
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,800
Why dig around? It's done.

441
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,200
It was a thing that fucking happened,
and you're here fucking pulling it all up.

442
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,080
And for what, eh?

443
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,800
For what? You want a fucking award?
A pat on the back?

444
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,680
Ignore him. He's off his heid.

445
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,720
- I'll wait outside for the ambulance.
- Off you go. I can handle this prick.

446
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,080
What's your fucking problem?

447
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,400
<i>Iain Adair was an arsehole.
Can I say that?</i>

448
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,800
<i>A term like "sadist"
is probably better.</i>

449
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
<i>Right.</i>

450
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,960
<i>- Well, he was a sadist. That's for sure.</i>
- You okay?

451
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,336
<i>An Olympic-level...</i>

452
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,080
<i>...cunt-apathic mad man.</i>

453
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,840
Just thinking,
if you're staying on for a few days,

454
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,760
I could do my shepherd's pie.

455
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,320
But, Pia, I'm not sure if you eat meat.

456
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
I do meat.

457
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,440
Okay.

458
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,360
Anything else, Mum?

459
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,880
No, no. I can see you're very busy.

460
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,200
That's Stuart.

461
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,680
Richard's boy.

462
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,760
Aye.

463
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,320
What is it you're working on?

464
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,680
We're doing a documentary

465
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,880
about what... happened.

466
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,320
Iain Adair and all that.

467
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,040
Not about your man and the eggs?

468
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,040
Uh, no.

469
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,160
You'll explain what he did to your father?

470
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,320
- Only if you want us to.
- Oh, I want you to.

471
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,600
People should know. Everyone should know.

472
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,280
My Kenny died because of that man.

473
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,840
If Iain Adair was still alive,

474
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,040
I'd wring his neck myself
with these hands. I would.

475
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,640
We were happy before he broke it all.

476
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,880
Ruined it all.

477
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,440
Such a stupid man.

478
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,480
Just the waste of it.

479
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
I'm sorry.

480
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,160
It's okay, Mum.

481
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,360
If there's anything
you want me to help with,

482
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,720
just ask.

483
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,640
- Yeah?
- Clap.

484
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
There we go.

485
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,360
Do I need to do that too?

486
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,280
Oh, no. You're okay.

487
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,520
I'll... I'll ask questions,
and you just answer as yourself. As you.

488
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
As me?

489
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,840
Uh,

490
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,320
just talk loosely about the case.

491
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,320
Loosely? Like, relaxed?

492
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
No.

493
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,240
Been years since I was in front
of any kind of camera at all.

494
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,440
Last time would've been
that old one your dad had.

495
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,400
- But your dad never had all this stuff.
- He wasn't filming for broadcast, Mum.

496
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,680
Can you imagine?

497
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,320
So, what do you think?

498
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
Well, it's a fascinating case.

499
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,160
Iain Adair, I mean, I'd heard of him.

500
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,560
But he's not as well-known
as a Ted Bundy or a Fred West.

501
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,520
So... ...if we take this anywhere,

502
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,440
the first question any platform,
network, whatever, is gonna ask is,

503
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,640
"What's the hook?"

504
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,800
What's the context?

505
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,200
There is a personal angle.
I mean, his dad was one of the victims.

506
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,200
Uh, yeah. He... he was a policeman.
He was shot at the farm.

507
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,080
So, he was murdered?

508
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,320
He died later.

509
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,160
Of his injuries or...

510
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,000
Not directly,
but... but... but basically, yeah.

511
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,280
But he was one of the victims.

512
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,960
- Mm.
- This gives him a voice.

513
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,920
And, you know, that's important to me,
you know, as a...

514
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
as a son.

515
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,400
I think definitely explore
the personal angle,

516
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,760
see what there is in it.

517
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,760
But, um, can you get hold of
any new material?

518
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,640
Police interviews, diaries,
that kind of thing.

519
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,800
We can look into those.

520
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,560
Something unseen, unheard, unexplored
is what you need.

521
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,840
What about the house itself
and the dungeon?

522
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,560
- It's still there.
- And you have access?

523
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
Yes.

524
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,840
Absolutely.

525
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,240
So, how come you're using this old thing?

526
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,360
Uh, the police forensics
shot on tape back then.

527
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,720
Plus, old tech,
cool analog horror atmosphere.

528
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,360
Proper <i>Blair Witch.</i>

529
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,320
Could you do that a bit more quietly?

530
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,720
Aye, I'll put the crowbar on whisper mode.

531
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,080
Okay.

532
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,080
Oh my God.

533
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Okay.

534
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,800
<i>♪ Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you? ♪</i>

535
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,000
- This is not recording.
- Uh...

536
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,080
Ah, uh, yeah. Tab's punched out.

537
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,760
It stops people recording over it.

538
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,560
- Open up.
- We're taping over <i>Bergerac</i>?

539
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,760
- Mum won't notice.
- Let's hope not.

540
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,760
Boo!

541
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,080
Jesus Christ.

542
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,040
Oh!

543
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,600
I found the door to fucking hell.

544
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,800
I'll get a light up.

545
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,760
Is that your stage-blood mix?

546
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,040
That is still in the bag.
This is lemon juice.

547
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,936
- Uh, what's that for?
- Shows up under black light.

548
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,840
- Like piss and blood and spunk and...
- Okay, okay, okay.

549
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,400
I'll just drip a wee bit down here

550
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,920
like Adair jizzed
while slitting someone's throat.

551
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,240
Fucking hell, Stuart.

552
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,320
Lights off, please.

553
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,880
And then...

554
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,080
Fucking hell.

555
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
I, uh...

556
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,800
don't think we need the lemon juice.

557
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,120
Jesus Christ.

558
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,440
All right, let's get to work.

559
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,280
That was fucking creepy.

560
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,280
Feel like I've had spiders
crawling over my brain.

561
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,760
Have you never been in a death dungeon?
No, I find it quite relaxing.

562
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,880
That might be a tourist draw
in itself, actually.

563
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,200
Good luck advertising that.

564
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,720

For what?

583
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,080
For not looking where I was going.

584
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,920
You're likely still concussed,
so we have to keep you in for observation.

Be on the safe side.

587
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,440
Look at her. She's a doctor.

00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,120
Davis's driving, eh?

589
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,120
And you and me both been
in the fucking wars.

590
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,240
You're the lucky one, no?

591
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,640
No wanking for me for a month.

592
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,360
Least you can draw that curtain round
and tug yourself into a coma, eh?

593
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,280
Right. Sparkling conversation as always,
Dad. Get well soon, eh?

594
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,160
- Aye, son.
- Uh-huh.

595
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,040
Any chance of a lift home?

596
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,640
Of course.

597
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,920
You rest up.

00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,160
- Bye, now.
- Bye.

599
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,760
I'll put that shepherd's pie on.

600
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,360
- Just for us girls.
- It's fine. I have stuff to digitize.

601
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,440
- I can just...
- You need to eat, dear.

602
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,920
Honestly, it's no fuss.

603
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320

<i>- Of course.</i>

618

What do you want?

619
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,560
You have to stop your film.

620
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
Why?

621
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,640
I don't have any proof.

622
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Of what?

623
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,480
I think I've always known.

624
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,960
Known what?

625
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000

<i>- Aye, Kenny. Over the moon.</i>

<i>And it's a big treat today</i>

638
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,160
<i>because the mistress is gonna have fun

00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,160
Are you sure you're okay, dear?

663
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,080
I'm just stepping out.

664
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,480
Out? Right now?

665
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,400
Yes, I just feel cooped up.
A little walk. Clear my head.

666
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,040
Are you sure everything's all right?

667
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,480
I'm fine, really. I... I won't be a minute.

668
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,760
Shit. Come on. Come on.

669
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,520
Maybe the crash gave you a shock, dear.

670
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,000
- You'll catch cold out here.
- I'm fine.

671
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,160
- You should get in.
- No!

672
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,280
Get in the car!

673
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,400
You come back now!

No.

676
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,240
Cunt!

677
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,440

690
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,736
<i>Years ago, I spent a night
with Kenny and Janet</i>

691
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,080
<i>and got carried away into adult stuff.</i>

692
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,480
You know, sex games.

693
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,480
I was married.

694
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,240
The way they behaved that night,
the whole experience,

695
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,640
made me think
that maybe Iain Adair hadn't acted alone.

696
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,576
<i>Police have announced
shocking new discoveries</i>

697
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,440
<i>about the notorious
Loch Henry murders of the 1990s.</i>

698
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,936
<i>For years, it was thought
Iain Adair acted alone.</i>

699
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,160
<i>In fact, he'd been under the guidance
of local officer Kenneth McCardle</i>

700
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,240
<i>and his wife, Janet.</i>

701
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,160
<i>McCardle shot
the Adairs dead,</i>

702
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,960
<i>deliberately wounding himself
to cover up his role in the slaughter.</i>

703
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,760
<i>The woman who hid the secret</i>

704
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,640
<i>of her and her husband's part
in the crimes killed herself...</i>

705
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,120
<i>...after leaving recordings of
the murders where her son would find them.</i>

706
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,000
<i>But your dad never had all this stuff.</i>

707
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,200
<i>He wasn't filming
for broadcast, Mum.</i>

708
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,720
<i>Can you imagine?</i>

709
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,400
<i>And so,
to honor this year's documentaries,</i>

710
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,400
<i>please welcome Kirsty Wark.</i>

711
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,920
Hey, quiet down!
This is us. This is the bit.

712
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,520
<i>The nominees for best factual series are...</i>

713
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,640
Suffer The Children:
The Tipley Pedophile Ring.

714
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,520
Loch Henry: Truth Will Out.

715
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,920
Yes!

716
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Euthanasia: Inside Project Junipero.

717
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,400
<i>And the BAFTA goes to...</i>

718
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,280
Loch Henry.

719
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:31,360
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

720
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,000
Come on!

721
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,080
Yes!

722
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,960
<i>Also, our fabulous post-house,
Cart Before Horse.</i>

723
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,280
<i>And, of course,
the most important person on the stage,</i>

724
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,760
<i>who allowed us to tell his story.</i>

725
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,920
<i>I'd like to dedicate this award
to Davis McCardle</i>

726
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,840
<i>and to his late girlfriend, Pia.</i>

727
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,600
Ugh. There's that actress from that comedy
about the bipolar single mum

728
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,560
who fucking cries all the time.

729
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,400
Tell us a joke, love.

730
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,400
Shit, she's coming over.

731
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,280
Can I just say, I <i>love </i>you.

732
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,360
And your show was sublime.

733
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,480
Oh, thank you.

734
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,520
Um, are you the <i>Loch Henry </i>guy?

735
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,080
Oh my God.

736
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,080
I am not worthy.

737
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,960
Such an incredible piece of work.

738
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,120
Thank you.

739
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,200
Kate Cezar, Historik.

740
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,360
We are actually developing a drama
based on the whole thing.

741
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,840
- Okay.
- We will be looking for a Pia.

742
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,840
- That's all I'm saying.
- Wow, that is interesting.

743
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,000
<i>Well done, you bastard!</i>

744
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,000
It's the red carpet for you, eh?

745
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,800
We've been booked up for weeks, pal.
Listen to how packed it is.

746
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,560
<i>Seriously, I just want to say...</i>
