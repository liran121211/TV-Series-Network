2
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,629
Ahem.

3
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:45,632
They're ready for you.

4
00:00:48,152 --> 00:00:50,052
Gwendolyn Harris. We've met.

5
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:51,290
Bournemouth.

6
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,011
But you don't know the others.

7
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:55,130
No, but I'm familiar with you.

8
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:57,650
Why do you want to be an MP?

9
00:00:57,651 --> 00:01:00,129
Because I'm not satisfied
with the way things are,

10
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,411
and rather than sit back and moan
I'd prefer to do something about it.

11
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:05,729
Go again from the top.

12
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,249
I don't know why anyone's surprised
the world's number one teen idol

13
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,809
has become a Scientologist.

14
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,369
Speed up the autocue, please.

15
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,529
Pop stars do believe in weird things.

16
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,929
'Abba believed in angels.
R Kelly believed he could fly...'

17
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,169
They said show you this.

18
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,651
This happened just now?

19
00:01:20,652 --> 00:01:21,330
Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,810
Gladwell?

21
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:25,529
"Shamed Tory Jason Gladwell
resigns," - capitals -

22
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,449
"over Twitter porn pics scandal."

23
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,969
Oh, so he wasn't hacked after all.

24
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,249
"Originally claimed
his account had been hacked,

25
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,249
"resignation statement admits
inappropriate correspondence

26
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,449
"with a 15-year-old girl."

27
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,449
So tweeting dick photos
is correspondence now, is it?

28
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,369
"Departure triggers a by-election

29
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,809
"in his Stentonford and Hersham
constituency."

30
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,331
Well, you get to use
the Gladwell stuff.

31
00:01:44,332 --> 00:01:45,370
Mm-hmm.

32
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,611
Bump it all up to
the top of the monologue.

33
00:01:47,612 --> 00:01:49,291
Anyone seen Jamie?

34
00:01:55,091 --> 00:01:56,170
Rach?

35
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:58,449
'You really shouldn't be
calling me any more.

36
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,171
'You need to sort yourself out.'

37
00:02:00,172 --> 00:02:01,690
I am.

38
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:04,171
'Focus on Waldo,
that's going well for you.'

39
00:02:04,172 --> 00:02:05,450
But it is not...

40
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:07,330
'He's a hit, Jamie.'

41
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:09,810
"He." Not me, "he".

42
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:11,450
'Just do your show.'

43
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:13,291
I will. I mean, hon,
if you'd just...

44
00:02:14,531 --> 00:02:16,091
Jamie?

45
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:18,851
Jamie, hurry up.

46
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:22,371
What do you know about
Stentonford and Hersham?

47
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:24,090
Safe Tory seat.

48
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:27,531
So, realistically, I know there's
not much of a chance, but...

49
00:02:27,532 --> 00:02:30,370
So, it's a stepping stone for you?

50
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:31,931
Yes.

51
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:36,529
Obviously, I wouldn't say
that outside of this room,

52
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,609
but, well,
you want me to be honest.

53
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,329
There's no point in pretending.

54
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,731
Is there anything in your past that
might conceivably cause problems?

55
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,131
No.

56
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:48,971
Except...

57
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:52,731
I did commit a series
of murders in Huddersfield

58
00:02:52,732 --> 00:02:54,730
between 1999 and 2003.

59
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:56,331
But apart from that...

60
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:02,610
Well, thank you, Gwendolyn.

61
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:04,531
If you could leave via that door.

62
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:06,290
Oh, that door?

63
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,331
We like to keep
the candidates separate.

64
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:10,891
Right, yes.

65
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:25,091
Idiot. Idiot!

66
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:30,171
Shamed super groomer and all-round
pillock of the community

67
00:03:30,172 --> 00:03:33,290
Jason Gladwell
has resigned as an MP,

68
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,970
saying he could no longer
maintain his position.

69
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:39,251
That position, presumably,
being hunched over

70
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,450
wanking madly at school kids.

71
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:42,971
'A pal of Gladwell said...'

72
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:43,890
You ready?

73
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,170
Uh-huh.

74
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:47,290
How old the girl wasn't.

75
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,929
That's the sort of feeble excuse

76
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,649
'only a naive school kid
would swallow -

77
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,531
'which, presumably, was the idea.

78
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:57,569
'Anyway, the bad news is
he's resigned in disgrace.'

79
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,811
The good news is he's now
free to pursue a full-time career

80
00:04:00,812 --> 00:04:03,491
in the disgraced paedophile
industry.

81
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:07,651
Personally, I don't understand
why anyone's surprised...

82
00:04:07,652 --> 00:04:09,930
Um, small change to the intro.

83
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:11,010
What?

84
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:14,089
- Nothing huge, Conor wanted the Jacko
gag for the monologue, so...
- That was my bit.

85
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,809
- There is the Chancellor stuff,
you could use that.
- Bit politics.

86
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,691
You can do politics.

87
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,210
I do piss-taking.

88
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:20,330
Go be Waldo.

89
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:21,530
Yes, commander.

90
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:23,449
'R Kelly believed he could fly,

91
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,771
'and Michael Jackson believed
that his doctor was qualified...'

92
00:04:26,772 --> 00:04:28,850
Big ball blue bear bollocks.

93
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,649
And now it's time
for our final visit

94
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,089
to the world of educational
children's programming

95
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,689
courtesy of everyone's favourite,

96
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,091
and only occasionally inappropriate
cool kids' TV character,

97
00:04:38,092 --> 00:04:39,451
Waldo.

98
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:44,970
Whose mum's in tonight, apparently.

99
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:47,731
Waldo, who have you had
in your cave this week?

100
00:04:47,732 --> 00:04:51,090
Well, Conor,
in my big pink cave this week

101
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:54,089
I had former Minister
for Culture Liam Monroe.

102
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,011
Oh, he's quite handsome, isn't he?

103
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:58,290
I was hoping he'd nosh me off!

104
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,091
Want to see how it panned out?

105
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,730
I think we should.

106
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:03,091
Run VT!

107
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:17,410
Hey, everybody!

108
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:19,370
It's Waldo time!

109
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:20,850
Yeah!

110
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:22,410
Cool! Cool!

111
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:25,370
Waldo-rrific!

112
00:05:25,371 --> 00:05:26,770
Ha-ha-ha!

113
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:30,250
Hey, kids,
my guest this week is Mr Monroe.

114
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:31,850
Hello, Mr Monroe.

115
00:05:31,851 --> 00:05:33,130
Hello, Waldo.

116
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:36,291
Mr Monroe is a politician.

117
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:42,930
So, what is a politician, Mr Monroe?

118
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:44,849
Well, a politician is someone

119
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,531
who tries to make the
world a fairer place.

120
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:49,090
Like Batman.

121
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:51,050
Not exactly like Batman.

122
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,890
Do you beat people up?

123
00:05:52,891 --> 00:05:54,329
No, I don't beat people up.

124
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,851
Oh, you're a pussy then?

125
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,651
Well, I'm not sure
I know exactly what...

126
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:02,211
You don't know what pussy is?

127
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,491
OK, this is clearly
some kind of joke.

128
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,090
No joke, sorry, let's move on.

129
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:11,371
Friends again?

130
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,450
Oh, hello, mate, great show.

131
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:24,609
Well done, really good.

132
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,849
So, we'll bring him over.

133
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,689
You go and get him,
I'll explain about...

134
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,291
'Now, he comes across...'

135
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:30,810
Jamie!

136
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:32,850
What you want, Miss Tamsin?

137
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,009
Behind me, man in glasses
talking to Jack Napier.

138
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,089
- Jack freaks me out.
- Yeah, ditto,

139
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,410
but he owns the company and the man he's
with is important and wants to talk to you.

140
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:42,930
He's from the channel.

141
00:06:42,931 --> 00:06:44,490
Go on.

142
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:46,649
- 'Honestly, all I'm saying...'
- 'Is he shy?'

143
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,889
'No, all I'm saying is
he's a terrific guy...'

144
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,131
Jim, Jamie, Jamie, Jim.

145
00:06:50,132 --> 00:06:51,250
How do you do?

146
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:52,450
Jim, Jack, James.

147
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:53,770
Jamie.

148
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:56,210
Jim was just talking about Waldo.

149
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:59,211
Yeah. Liam Monroe
has lodged a complaint.

150
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:01,690
Toys out the pram.

151
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:03,050
And that's...?

152
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:04,410
Good press.

153
00:07:04,411 --> 00:07:06,649
It's so tough to get
a breakthrough these days,

154
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,329
but when it does,
well, it's just fantastic.

155
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,769
It's fantastic the way Waldo puts
the piss up Monroe.

156
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,051
You know, all those twats,
it's punk, it's... it's...

157
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:16,410
'Jack?'

158
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:17,771
Excuse me.

159
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:22,531
Well, Twitter can't get
enough of Waldo, loves him.

160
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:27,051
Look, I know the show's
coming back again next year,

161
00:07:27,052 --> 00:07:29,451
but we want to see more of Waldo.

162
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:33,011
They want to do a pilot.

163
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:33,970
A Waldo pilot?

164
00:07:33,971 --> 00:07:36,131
Yeah. I mean, how does that sound?

165
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:38,290
Yeah. Sounds good.

166
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,490
Sounds stormin' Norman,
fucking stormin'.

167
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:42,971
Going to give it to 'em.

168
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:05,609
But look, we can't do sketches
without Waldo.

169
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,569
It's a Waldo pilot,
it's a Waldo show,

170
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,169
it's got to be Waldo, Waldo, Waldo.

171
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,929
Realistically, there isn't
the budget for other animations.

172
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,129
I mean live action,
other characters I can do.

173
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,009
What about the Brown Knight?

174
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,569
What, the crap crusader?

175
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,409
We can look into the Brown Knight.

176
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,131
But right now
let's find more Waldo ideas.

177
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:27,089
The problem is, any guests
we book will be in on it.

178
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,451
They know that Waldo's a joke,
the surprise is gone.

179
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:31,410
So, we think round that.

180
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,891
Hey, boys and girls!
It's Waldo time!

181
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:36,051
Yeah! Ha-ha!

182
00:08:37,331 --> 00:08:39,130
He's awesome, isn't he?

183
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:42,851
I mean, look - sod name in lights,
you're an app now, my brother.

184
00:08:45,211 --> 00:08:48,129
All right, Sara? How's the
think tanking going, good shit?

185
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,131
Um, yeah, yeah,
we're making headway.

186
00:08:50,132 --> 00:08:51,610
Good.

187
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:53,929
I see our friend Monroe
is in the news again,

188
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,649
running in
the Stentonford by-election.

189
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,251
We should get Waldo down there.

190
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:01,287
Hey, that's not a bad idea,
actually.

191
00:09:01,288 --> 00:09:04,489
We get a van with a screen with
the image of Waldo on the side.

192
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,688
Like it.

193
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:07,927
And then, when Monroe's
doing a meet and greet,

194
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:09,807
we just turn up
and just get under his skin.

195
00:09:09,808 --> 00:09:11,047
I love that, I love it.

196
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:11,887
We've done Monroe.

197
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:13,266
But it was a great bit.

198
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:15,786
I'm not dumb or clever enough
to be political...

199
00:09:15,787 --> 00:09:19,146
Why don't we get Waldo
to stand for the by-election?

200
00:09:19,147 --> 00:09:21,466
- Get people to vote for him?
- He's not real.

201
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:23,946
But people have stood as
fictional characters before.

202
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:26,266
Do you think Screaming
Lord Sutch was his real name?

203
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,546
We just put "commonly known as"
on the ballot.

204
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:30,846
No-one's actually going to vote
for him, that's not the point.

205
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,019
The point is, we get to hang around,
we're there for the count.

206
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,701
Well, go on then, Sara,
whack it up there.

207
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,783
'He's with a mum and baby group.'

208
00:09:55,784 --> 00:09:59,463
OK. Going live
in five... four... three two...

209
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:02,142
'Thank you so much
for joining me this morning.'

210
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,782
It's been incredibly informative

211
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:06,984
and I think we should have a little
round of applause for the children,

212
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:08,943
who were fantastic.

213
00:10:08,944 --> 00:10:11,463
Thank you, Naomi.

214
00:10:11,464 --> 00:10:13,344
Thank you for your time.

215
00:10:16,304 --> 00:10:17,783
Hey!

216
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,343
Hey, it's me Waldo.

217
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:22,783
Oh. I like your trainers, man!

218
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:25,302
I'd wear trainers myself
but I can't cos I haven't got feet.

219
00:10:25,303 --> 00:10:26,344
I've got stumps.

220
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:28,623
He's out.

221
00:10:28,624 --> 00:10:30,703
Hey, Mr Monroe! Mr Monroe.

222
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:32,822
Hey! Did you get off with
any of the mums?

223
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:34,944
Where'd you look while
they were breastfeeding?

224
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:37,423
They got big milky tits, Mr Monroe!

225
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:39,183
He said it!

226
00:10:39,184 --> 00:10:41,623
Mr Monroe, don't walk away from me!

227
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:43,542
- I'm sorry about this, Liam.
- Hey, I'm being snubbed!

228
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,262
Hey, don't ignore me.
Don't just get in your car.

229
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:48,502
It's a death trap anyway,
look at it!

230
00:10:48,503 --> 00:10:50,544
Let's find out what we can about
the idiot inside that thing.

231
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:51,544
Sure.

232
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,544
Mr Monroe. Oi!

233
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:59,943
'Stentonford Labour Party.'

234
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:01,864
Right, you've got
a choice of styles,

235
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:07,183
so just choose one from there.
Then you put your name in there.

236
00:11:07,184 --> 00:11:08,864
This is like bloody Moonpig.

237
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:11,864
Don't knock the free mail out.

238
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:16,904
Bet Liam Monroe doesn't use some
Fisher-Price leaflet app.

239
00:11:16,905 --> 00:11:18,424
He doesn't have to.

240
00:11:24,304 --> 00:11:27,102
Day one of the campaign
in Stentonford and Hersham,

241
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,942
and Tory hopeful Liam Monroe
hits the ground running.

242
00:11:29,943 --> 00:11:32,822
The license fee is something
that's very close to my heart...

243
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:35,224
'Mr Monroe, ey! Oh, oh, oh!
Look at me Mr Monroe, please!'

244
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:37,823
Hey, over here! Hey, over here...

245
00:11:37,824 --> 00:11:39,823
Look over here, Mr Monroe...

246
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,622
The Conservative Party
have been, er...

247
00:11:41,623 --> 00:11:45,222
Have been arguing for a reduction
of the license fee for...

248
00:11:45,223 --> 00:11:47,182
- Good morning, everybody.
- Pardon?

249
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:48,624
Why you ignoring me, Mr Monroe?
Mr Monroe? Why you ignoring me?

250
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,863
I beg your pardon.

251
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:51,943
I'm sorry. It's rather loud.

252
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,462
We have argued for a further
reduction in the license fee...

253
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,382
Mr Monroe? Why you ignoring me?

254
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:57,182
Mum with a pushchair -
drag her into it.

255
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,624
Hey, you. Mum with the pushchair.

256
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:02,623
Yeah, you. Ask Mr Monroe
why he's ignoring me.

257
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:04,863
Why are you ignoring Waldo?

258
00:12:04,864 --> 00:12:08,263
'Mr Monroe, what's Waldo
done to you?'

259
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:11,824
We should probably just shift
before this turns stupid.

260
00:12:13,104 --> 00:12:15,144
I'm not walking away from a cartoon.

261
00:12:16,984 --> 00:12:18,743
'I'm not ignoring you.'

262
00:12:18,744 --> 00:12:20,943
Yeah, you were, you upset me.

263
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:23,063
You made Waldo sad.

264
00:12:23,064 --> 00:12:26,584
Wa-a-a-a-a-a-ah.

265
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:31,944
Well, obviously, I'm absolutely
devastated that you're upset...

266
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:34,144
WA-A-A-A-A-A-A...

267
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,304
Let him get a word in.

268
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:44,063
I'm not ignoring you
because there is no you.

269
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,903
You are an image voiced
by a comedian -

270
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:48,782
an alleged comedian,
more accurately.

271
00:12:48,783 --> 00:12:50,902
If I'm not real,
why you talking to him?

272
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,864
And by "him" I mean me, knobber!

273
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:57,744
There's no point in attempting
to converse with a cartoon.

274
00:12:57,745 --> 00:13:00,543
Ooh, "converse", Your Lordship!

275
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:03,944
Thy flowery language doth give
me a right throbbing bone-on!

276
00:13:03,945 --> 00:13:05,704
Uh-ha-ha-ha-huh!

277
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:09,103
Uh-er-ha-ha!

278
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:11,223
Ha-ha-ha-ha-uh-uh-uh!

279
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:14,783
Uh-uh-uh-oh! Huh!

280
00:13:14,784 --> 00:13:16,184
Finished.

281
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:25,303
Drink?

282
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,904
I've got e-mails.

283
00:13:33,424 --> 00:13:36,503
You know that's Gwendolyn Harris?

284
00:13:36,504 --> 00:13:37,784
The Labour candidate.

285
00:13:39,624 --> 00:13:41,384
Did you read my background doc?

286
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:42,544
Yes.

287
00:13:44,104 --> 00:13:46,584
Why don't you read it tonight? Alone.

288
00:13:56,224 --> 00:13:59,424
I'll swing by about nine,
so have your breakfast first...

289
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:01,463
Are you my dad?

290
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:04,384
Apparently not. See you tomorrow.

291
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:09,422
'..Waldo the bear left
Monroe in stunned silence.

292
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:11,942
'The colourful Waldo
launched his own campaign

293
00:14:11,943 --> 00:14:14,784
'in typically loud and
crowd-pleasing style...'

294
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,064
Someone's bold? Do I know you?

295
00:14:20,065 --> 00:14:22,423
Nice way to greet a voter...

296
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:24,383
Sorry, I thought you were...

297
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:27,383
Actually, I'm more of a rival.

298
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:30,942
"Hey, Mr Monroe, Mr Monroe, why
are you ignoring me, Mr Monroe?"

299
00:14:30,943 --> 00:14:32,182
You're good at that!

300
00:14:32,183 --> 00:14:33,302
Because I am that.

301
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:34,424
What? You're that thing?

302
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:37,783
Waldo's not a thing, he's a bear.

303
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:42,143
Liam Monroe calls him worse.
Nice work there, by the way.

304
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:45,664
Yeah, well. It's dick jokes
at his expense basically.

305
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:46,783
Another one?

306
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:48,224
OK. One.

307
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,624
The way you describe it, it's like
you're doing this for a showreel...

308
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,663
No...

309
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:59,384
like this place is the equivalent
of a walk-on in a sketch show...

310
00:14:59,385 --> 00:15:00,423
Shh!

311
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:02,802
But your party leader has to show
up because it's a... mid-thing...

312
00:15:02,891 --> 00:15:04,090
Midterm by-election.

313
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:05,132
Terminology tits.

314
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:06,331
You are 12!

315
00:15:06,332 --> 00:15:08,290
So because leaderballs is there,

316
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,330
suddenly it's walk-on
in a Ricky Gervais sketch show

317
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:12,690
so it's good exposure.

318
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:15,210
- You're not going to win, you know
you're not going to win...
- Come on, shh.

319
00:15:15,211 --> 00:15:17,252
You're not going to win though.

320
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:18,291
Of course not.

321
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,490
So, why not be honest?

322
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:21,530
Say, "You arseholes aren't
going to vote for me,

323
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:22,970
"so here's what I think anyway."?

324
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:26,412
- It doesn't work like that.
- Nothing does, that's why
everything's bollocksed.

325
00:15:26,413 --> 00:15:29,611
You're angry, for someone
who's doing well.

326
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:33,531
I'm the voice of a blue bear...

327
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,292
if that's, "doing well,"
then we are doomed!

328
00:15:40,412 --> 00:15:41,491
I can't see!

329
00:15:41,492 --> 00:15:43,012
Hang on, there's a thing.

330
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:49,892
Have you had a fox in here or do you
live like a 14-year-old?

331
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:56,532
Well, don't get too excited,
I'm not sleeping in it.

332
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:57,892
Shit, really?

333
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:15,811
You're amazing.

334
00:16:15,812 --> 00:16:16,971
Sorry?

335
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:18,811
You're amazing?

336
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,452
Oh, thank you!

337
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:45,851
What's up?

338
00:16:45,852 --> 00:16:47,411
Nothing.

339
00:16:47,412 --> 00:16:48,732
Are you sure?

340
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:55,172
It's just...

341
00:16:59,172 --> 00:17:01,892
I haven't been happy in a while...

342
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:06,691
and this is good, you know?

343
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,732
Hm.

344
00:17:17,892 --> 00:17:20,732
Can I... have your number?

345
00:17:24,652 --> 00:17:26,172
Yes!

346
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:45,092
Where's our mark this morning?

347
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:46,611
We're out on the road.

348
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:48,732
Ooh... bien sur.

349
00:17:52,252 --> 00:18:00,011
Oh, hello, I'm Mr Monroe.
Vote for me and keep things shitty.

350
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,092
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

351
00:18:23,532 --> 00:18:30,372
Vote Waldo! Vote Waldo!

352
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:34,692
'You're right. Strong Tory.'

353
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:35,971
'I warned you.'

354
00:18:35,972 --> 00:18:39,572
You know you're on Monroe turf
when they live so far apart.

355
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:43,012
I'm voting Waldo!

356
00:18:46,652 --> 00:18:48,971
I met Waldo last night.

357
00:18:48,972 --> 00:18:50,892
Jamie, the guy who plays him.

358
00:18:50,893 --> 00:18:52,011
He's fun.

359
00:18:52,012 --> 00:18:53,611
Fun?

360
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:54,652
Mmm-hmm.

361
00:18:56,612 --> 00:18:59,212
Did you tell him anything
about our campaign?

362
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:00,771
Not really.

363
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,412
Not really or no?

364
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:05,172
Er, not really.

365
00:19:06,136 --> 00:19:07,335
Look, he's OK.

366
00:19:07,336 --> 00:19:08,535
He's a comedian -

367
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:10,976
he's mocking Monroe now,
it'll be you next.

368
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:15,935
His act is all f-this
and penis jokes.

369
00:19:15,936 --> 00:19:17,015
But...

370
00:19:17,016 --> 00:19:18,896
Don't see him again.

371
00:19:25,576 --> 00:19:28,576
OK. Job done till
the husting tomorrow.

372
00:19:29,656 --> 00:19:32,694
Some media students doing
a Question Time type thing.

373
00:19:32,695 --> 00:19:34,694
They've asked Waldo
to join the panel.

374
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:37,774
Oh, come on. It's my nightmare,
going on Question Time.

375
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:39,014
It's students, you'll walk it.

376
00:19:39,015 --> 00:19:40,774
I can't answer
serious questions...

377
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:44,016
No-one wants you to!
You're the comic relief, lighten up.

378
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:59,536
Erm, just have a look. I'm sure
you'll find lots in there...

379
00:20:02,056 --> 00:20:07,336
Are there any particular issues that
you're concerned about at all?

380
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:24,055
Hey.

381
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,095
Oh, hi.

382
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:27,294
- I thought we were going to...?
- Sorry - I've had a tough day...

383
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:28,536
Right. Not even one?

384
00:20:28,537 --> 00:20:30,175
Sorry.

385
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:31,736
Well, what about tomorrow?

386
00:20:33,176 --> 00:20:35,776
- Look, I can't, when this is happening,
I can't see you.
- What do you mean?

387
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:36,896
I'm sorry.

388
00:20:49,438 --> 00:20:51,958
Do they think that
looks like Question Time?

389
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,998
Yeah. It looks politicsy.

390
00:20:55,518 --> 00:20:57,437
Check the host.

391
00:20:57,442 --> 00:20:58,602
Jailbait Dimbleby.

392
00:21:06,162 --> 00:21:10,322
When it comes to addiction
and addicts, we should sympathise,

393
00:21:10,362 --> 00:21:12,520
but we shouldn't patronise.

394
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,919
You know, serious drug use is
a criminal of fence, that is

395
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,521
committed voluntarily
and for pleasure...

396
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:22,039
Look, I'm sorry, these are the
facts.

397
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,399
Waldo, what do you think?

398
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,041
Mr Monroe, are you addicted?

399
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:26,760
No.

400
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:28,681
Sorry, I mean, are you a dickhead?

401
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:32,999
I think we have to ask ourselves...

402
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,479
I think we have to ask ourselves,
what is this for?

403
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,401
And why do we waste our time with
animated trivialities like him?

404
00:21:42,161 --> 00:21:43,240
I mean why?

405
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:44,400
Why? I mean why?

406
00:21:44,401 --> 00:21:46,400
I mean why? I mean why?

407
00:21:46,401 --> 00:21:47,919
I mean why? I mean why?

408
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,399
This is just the kind of thing...
rather than see you laugh...

409
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,959
They laugh at you, Limbo.

410
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,439
You laugh, you're laughing
at someone who won't engage.

411
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,761
Who is scared to engage, who
hides behind a children's cartoon.

412
00:21:59,762 --> 00:22:02,560
Who you calling a kiddy toon, fool?

413
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:07,400
I'm... I'm... I'm
speaking about James Salter.

414
00:22:07,401 --> 00:22:08,681
Hm?

415
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:12,440
Don't worry about it.

416
00:22:12,441 --> 00:22:14,520
That's your name, isn't it?

417
00:22:14,521 --> 00:22:17,041
James Salter, this is the man
who's behind all this.

418
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:19,960
He's 33 years old,

419
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:23,799
a man whose career can be summed up
surprisingly quickly.

420
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,319
You were in a sketch troupe

421
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,719
that enjoyed minor success about
six years ago,

422
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,799
and the others moved on to
better things,

423
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,559
but your main achievement seems to
have been playing

424
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,239
the part of a corn on the cob

425
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,241
in a high-interest personal
loan commercial.

426
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:40,559
I notice you keep that
pretty quiet.

427
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,719
And now of course operating
this sort of teddy bear thing.

428
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,561
Which by the way is easier than it
looks. Anyone could do it.

429
00:22:46,562 --> 00:22:53,040
See, this is... this is the thing.
It's easy, what he does.

430
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,560
He mocks.

431
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:57,079
And when he can't
think of an authentic joke,

432
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,881
which is actually quite often,
he just swears.

433
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:04,999
I think that this puppet's
inclusion on this panel debases the

434
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,079
process of debate, and smothers any
meaningful discussion of the issues.

435
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,679
So I return to my original question,
is that really what this is for?

436
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,761
He has nothing to offer
and he has nothing to say.

437
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,560
Prove me wrong. Hm?

438
00:23:19,561 --> 00:23:21,640
Speak, Waldo.

439
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:25,841
Please. Come on. Speak up.

440
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:31,280
There you see, nothing.

441
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:32,521
Oh, go fuck yourself.

442
00:23:34,641 --> 00:23:36,400
It's more swearing.

443
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:37,680
You're a joke.

444
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:38,959
You look less human than I do

445
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,121
and I'm a made-up bear with
a turquoise cock.

446
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:48,440
What are you? You're just an old
attitude with new hair.

447
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:51,359
Assuming you're my superior because
I'm not taking you seriously?

448
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,719
No-one takes you seriously,
that's why no-one votes.

449
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,039
The vast majority do vote.

450
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,879
It's bullshit.

451
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,199
Surely this is enough?

452
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,799
You think you deserve respect.

453
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,879
Just common courtesy.

454
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,359
Because you went to public school

455
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,519
and believed you were
entitled to everything.

456
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,639
- Perhaps we could get back...
- Ad hominem nonsense...

457
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,719
Gwendolyn Harris...

458
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,839
Something's got to change. No-one
trusts you lot cos they know

459
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,519
you don't give a shit about anything
outside your bubble.

460
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,239
What about your mate Gladwell,
the kiddy-flasher?

461
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,039
You knew him for 20 years,
did you not know what he was like?

462
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,121
No, of course not.

463
00:24:19,122 --> 00:24:23,520
Yeah, cos you're all just front,
like him, sly and pretending,

464
00:24:23,521 --> 00:24:25,521
and in that way you're all the same.

465
00:24:25,522 --> 00:24:30,320
Gwendolyn Harris,
is all of politics a waste of time?

466
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:32,800
Well, of course I think no...

467
00:24:32,801 --> 00:24:35,760
Oh, shut up, you're worse!

468
00:24:35,761 --> 00:24:37,639
Seriously, she's faker than him.

469
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,719
- For once I agree with Liam Monroe
in that this...
- Are you going to win?

470
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,919
Doesn't get us anywhere and
there's no point in us continuing...

471
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,399
Tell them why you're here.

472
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,921
If we can't have anything
resembling a deba...

473
00:24:46,922 --> 00:24:48,961
Tell them why you're here.

474
00:24:52,121 --> 00:24:54,240
She's here to build a showreel.

475
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:56,799
I'm not kidding, that's literally
it.

476
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,041
Knows she's not going to win.
This is all experience,

477
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:00,320
to get on telly.

478
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:02,919
She actually gives less of a shit
about anyone round here than

479
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,321
he does, because he'll actually
have to represent you.

480
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:06,520
Am I wrong?

481
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:10,520
A career politician.
Someone else less real than me,

482
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:11,801
and I can do this.

483
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:17,881
Can I just make
a couple of points?

484
00:25:17,882 --> 00:25:19,600
Oh, shut up, you pebble.

485
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,319
What is this for? That's what you
wanted to know, Mr Monroe.

486
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,321
And the truth is, none of us
know any more, thanks to you.

487
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:28,520
What are you for? What are you for?

488
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:30,321
Thank you and goodnight.

489
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,041
Jamie.

490
00:26:24,841 --> 00:26:26,001
Jamie?

491
00:26:27,641 --> 00:26:29,961
Jack's here. He wants to see us.

492
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:32,441
You can't avoid it.

493
00:26:37,801 --> 00:26:41,081
Get dressed, he'll meet us outside.

494
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,641
'And yet accusations of vapidity

508
00:27:41,282 --> 00:27:42,281
Shitifying.

509
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:45,399
You are everywhere, my son.

510
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,521
Twitter, the news...
Have you seen the poll?

511
00:27:47,522 --> 00:27:49,720
You're in third place, mate.

512
00:27:49,721 --> 00:27:51,359
You overtook that Lib Dem prick...

513
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,001
- Yeah, well, he's a glass of water.
- This is an opportunity, Jamie.

514
00:27:54,002 --> 00:27:56,040
He knows my name now.

515
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,839
We could really do something here.

516
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,199
You know, everyone's pissed
with the status quo.

517
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,041
And Waldo gives that a voice.

518
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:04,800
Waldo's a bear. A blue bear.

519
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:06,400
Tell him, Tams.

520
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:08,640
We've been asked on Consensus.

521
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:12,041
It's a ten-minute one-to-one
interview with Phillip Crane.

522
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:13,160
Pitbull Crane?

523
00:28:13,161 --> 00:28:14,239
Big guns for big guns.

524
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,519
Hello? I'm not a politician, OK?
I don't want to be a politician.

525
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,879
We know that you hate politics.

526
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,439
I don't hate them,
I'm just not interested in them.

527
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,159
You don't need to be
interested in them.

528
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,481
You just need to be Waldo.

529
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:29,401
And when Crane asks something tricky and I look
stupid because I don't know how to answer?

530
00:28:29,402 --> 00:28:31,480
You'll know the answer.

531
00:28:31,481 --> 00:28:33,241
Because you have a producer.

532
00:28:33,242 --> 00:28:36,720
Look, I can tell you what to say.

533
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:39,639
I can live Google any facts,
give you stats, quotes,

534
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,679
whatever else you need.

535
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,919
So you've got a safety
net for the concrete stuff

536
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,481
and the rest is Waldo
and you can do that in your sleep.

537
00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:47,520
You'll piss all over Crane.

538
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:49,599
He'll know there's a team around me,
he'll see it.

539
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,199
Yeah good. I hope he does.
I hope he points a camera at it.

540
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,281
All the other MPs have got teams,
we're just more honest about it.

541
00:28:55,282 --> 00:28:57,721
Now come on. What d'you say? Eh?

542
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:02,181
Jamie! Jamie!

543
00:29:02,182 --> 00:29:03,420
Why would I want to do this?

544
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:06,460
Look, the world is knackered
and you can do something about it.

545
00:29:06,461 --> 00:29:07,940
I don't know what you're on about.

546
00:29:07,941 --> 00:29:10,860
Waldo has got the attention
of the young, and the young don't

547
00:29:10,861 --> 00:29:13,860
give a shit about anything
except trainers and pirating films.

548
00:29:13,861 --> 00:29:16,620
Do you have any other astounding
theories about young people?

549
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:20,220
Yeah, yeah I do actually.
Look, they care about Waldo.

550
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:21,580
They'll vote for Waldo.

551
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:23,060
The video was a hit for a reason.

552
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,380
The video's embarrassing.
I'm embarrassed by it.

553
00:29:25,381 --> 00:29:27,300
I was lashing out.
I wasn't even articulate -

554
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:29,500
Doesn't matter.
Or funny, which is almost worse.

555
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,780
We can build on that.

556
00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:31,860
Waldo's not real.

557
00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:35,660
Exactly! That's what you said that
really hit home. He's not real,

558
00:29:35,661 --> 00:29:37,220
but he's realer than all the others.

559
00:29:37,221 --> 00:29:38,900
He doesn't stand for anything.

560
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:41,342
Yeah, well, at least
he doesn't pretend to.

561
00:29:41,343 --> 00:29:43,861
Look we... we don't need politicians,

562
00:29:43,862 --> 00:29:46,700
we've all got iPhones
and computers, right?

563
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:50,260
So any decision that has to be made,
any policy, we just put it online.

564
00:29:50,261 --> 00:29:54,020
Let the people vote thumbs up,
thumbs down, the majority wins.

565
00:29:54,021 --> 00:29:56,900
That's a democracy. That's a...
that's an actual democracy.

566
00:29:56,901 --> 00:29:59,900
So's YouTube and I don't know
if you've seen it but the most

567
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:03,942
popular video is a dog farting
the theme tune to Happy Days.

568
00:30:06,022 --> 00:30:07,861
Well, today it's Waldo.

569
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:10,541
No. It's still the dog.

570
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,180
Listen, can you imagine all
the things we can change

571
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:15,220
if we fuck the politicians
out the equation?

572
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:17,742
I've said what I've said
and now I'm shutting this door.

573
00:30:23,742 --> 00:30:25,781
Do you know who owns Waldo?

574
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:26,982
I do, I own the rights.

575
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:30,821
He's my character.

576
00:30:30,822 --> 00:30:32,462
Yeah, written for my show.

577
00:30:33,502 --> 00:30:38,221
You're too frightened to take to
the next level. Fine. I understand.

578
00:30:38,222 --> 00:30:40,101
But also, fuck off!

579
00:30:40,102 --> 00:30:41,062
And watch me fly.

580
00:30:41,063 --> 00:30:43,502
You own Waldo, you can't be Waldo.

581
00:30:46,182 --> 00:30:49,742
Eh, Jamie, Jamie,
Jamie, what's 'appenin, eh?

582
00:30:51,902 --> 00:30:53,182
Pretty close, I'd say.

583
00:30:58,852 --> 00:31:01,051
What's happenin'? Ahh!

584
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:04,777
Waldorific, yeah! Yeah!

585
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:06,136
Why is it going off left again?

586
00:31:06,137 --> 00:31:06,856
Because the...

587
00:31:06,857 --> 00:31:09,218
- I know! I've got my...
- Put your thumb in the white thing.

588
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:11,137
I got that. In there? OK.

589
00:31:11,138 --> 00:31:12,818
That's not how that works.

590
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:26,137
First tonight, a figure -
or more accurately a character -

591
00:31:26,138 --> 00:31:29,776
who's been causing an upset
in the Stentonford by-election.

592
00:31:29,777 --> 00:31:33,136
Unlike the other candidates,
he has no party affiliation.

593
00:31:33,137 --> 00:31:35,016
He doesn't even have a surname.

594
00:31:35,017 --> 00:31:39,418
He is Waldo, a few weeks ago just
a cult character in a comedy show.

595
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,057
Today, an official
mascot for protest voters.

596
00:31:43,058 --> 00:31:44,217
Vote Waldo.

597
00:31:44,218 --> 00:31:47,576
Cartoons don't play by the rules
and Waldo's open disdain

598
00:31:47,577 --> 00:31:50,378
for his opponents
has clearly struck a chord.

599
00:31:53,018 --> 00:31:55,696
Waldo, as a mascot
for the disenfranchised, aren't you

600
00:31:55,697 --> 00:31:58,938
ultimately neutralizing seriously
effective dissent?

601
00:32:00,138 --> 00:32:02,056
Can I have subtitles for Mr Crane,
please?

602
00:32:02,057 --> 00:32:05,496
By encouraging people not to care,
you're actively dangerous.

603
00:32:05,497 --> 00:32:07,498
Dangerous? You think
the public can't be trusted?

604
00:32:07,499 --> 00:32:08,577
No.

605
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:10,058
Isn't that basically you
calling them twats?

606
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:11,057
No, I...

607
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:12,137
Bell-ends then?

608
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,736
Did you come for a discussion
or...

609
00:32:13,737 --> 00:32:16,936
You're snooty for a glorified
Punch And Judy man, Phil.

610
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:19,776
You know you're gonna get your best
ratings in months cos I'm here.

611
00:32:19,777 --> 00:32:22,576
To even get close to the figures
I'm gonna pull in for you tonight,

612
00:32:22,577 --> 00:32:25,416
you'd have to fuck a prawn sandwich
live on air.

613
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:27,056
Make a nice prawn cocktail.

614
00:32:27,057 --> 00:32:29,216
Could we make a serious
political point that is...

615
00:32:29,217 --> 00:32:31,136
I've got one big blue point
to make, fool.

616
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:33,016
- Would you like to have a look at it?
- Oh, God. Thank you.

617
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,776
Great work tonight. Look at... Look
at this, look at this.

618
00:32:35,777 --> 00:32:38,936
It's The Waldo polling app.
Now, this can pinpoint you with GPS

619
00:32:38,937 --> 00:32:40,776
so that when you're at a polling
station,

620
00:32:40,777 --> 00:32:42,338
it unlocks loads of free shit, look.

621
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:46,337
Thanks for voting, dickhead!

622
00:32:46,338 --> 00:32:47,496
It's good, isn't it?

623
00:32:47,497 --> 00:32:48,936
Who's this guy we're meeting?

624
00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:52,858
I dunno. But he's from Washington
and he's got my restricted number.

625
00:32:56,218 --> 00:32:58,937
Jeff Carter, from the agency.

626
00:32:58,938 --> 00:32:59,577
Hey. Hey.

627
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:00,856
And I'll leap right in.

628
00:33:00,857 --> 00:33:03,458
I think what you're doing
with Waldo is fascinating.

629
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:04,777
From "the agency"?

630
00:33:04,778 --> 00:33:08,458
Yeah, listen. Waldo may be
the perfect political figurehead.

631
00:33:08,459 --> 00:33:09,937
Waldo The Bear.

632
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:12,976
The bear, people like.
The fact he's a bear is an assist.

633
00:33:12,977 --> 00:33:14,496
- An assist?
- It helps.

634
00:33:14,497 --> 00:33:16,736
Right. You look at human
politicians,

635
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:19,576
you're instinctively like,
"brrrr" - uncanny, right?

636
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:20,776
Like the girls in porn.

637
00:33:20,777 --> 00:33:23,296
You know something's wrong,
cos why else are they doing it?

638
00:33:23,297 --> 00:33:24,976
It's usually daddy issues, eh?

639
00:33:24,977 --> 00:33:27,296
Just like politics.
Waldo bypasses that.

640
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,778
You already know he's not real,
so no personal flaws.

641
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:31,257
I'm a person.

642
00:33:31,258 --> 00:33:33,136
With respect, Waldo's more than you.

643
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:36,778
He's a team, and you're open
about that, which is fantastic.

644
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:38,737
The honesty thing works.

645
00:33:38,738 --> 00:33:43,017
Waldo is a construct
people not just accept but embrace.

646
00:33:43,018 --> 00:33:44,938
At the moment he's anti-politics,

647
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:48,017
which is a political stance itself,
right?

648
00:33:48,018 --> 00:33:50,936
But he could deliver any brand
of political content,

649
00:33:50,937 --> 00:33:53,816
minus the potential downsides
of a human messenger.

650
00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:57,696
In a debate, your team could Google
every word the other guy says,

651
00:33:57,697 --> 00:33:59,696
then let Waldo hit him
with debunk stats

652
00:33:59,697 --> 00:34:02,898
and spit a Twitter-ready
zinger into the next sentence.

653
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:05,217
He's the perfect assassin.

654
00:34:05,218 --> 00:34:06,938
We won't win, though.

655
00:34:10,658 --> 00:34:12,657
You guys are so British.

656
00:34:12,658 --> 00:34:16,776
No, of course he won't win. You
started out too coarse off the bat.

657
00:34:16,777 --> 00:34:19,978
There's no substantial basis
to what you offer, and the whole

658
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:24,377
nihilist "democracy sucks" thing,
yeah, is kind of wack-a-doo,

659
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:28,857
but with a targeted, hopeful
message, which we can provide,

660
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:32,056
energising the disenfranchised
without spooking the middle

661
00:34:32,057 --> 00:34:36,538
via your new platform... You got
a global political-entertainment

662
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:39,058
product people actually want.

663
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,418
You could roll this out worldwide.

664
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:44,337
Like Pringles.

665
00:34:44,338 --> 00:34:45,738
Absolutely.

666
00:34:50,578 --> 00:34:54,177
It's, er... It's interesting stuff
though.

667
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:55,976
When you're done with Stentonford,

668
00:34:55,977 --> 00:34:58,578
there may be an opportunity
in South America.

669
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:00,217
Se puede hablar espanol?

670
00:35:00,218 --> 00:35:02,657
Vivi en Madrid tres anos.

671
00:35:02,658 --> 00:35:04,498
Excelente.

672
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:24,578
What?

673
00:35:25,978 --> 00:35:27,537
He's not coming.

674
00:35:27,538 --> 00:35:30,137
But he's the party leader!

675
00:35:30,138 --> 00:35:31,258
It's too toxic.

676
00:35:34,858 --> 00:35:37,256
Meanwhile,
as support for Gwendolyn Harris

677
00:35:37,257 --> 00:35:38,536
appears to be dwindling,

678
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:42,416
Labour denies the party is losing
faith in their young candidate.

679
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:45,098
But Miss Harris spent most of
the day locked in crisis talks

680
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:46,338
at party headqu...

681
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:54,298
In the Stentonford by-election,
Waldo the cartoon bear continues...

682
00:35:55,538 --> 00:35:58,016
Did you see Gwendolyn Harris
yesterday?

683
00:35:58,017 --> 00:36:00,098
She looks like she's been poisoned.

684
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:02,497
Because he's gonna overtake her.

685
00:36:02,498 --> 00:36:03,896
We're still way ahead.

686
00:36:03,897 --> 00:36:07,218
If that thing is the main opposition
then the whole system looks absurd.

687
00:36:09,898 --> 00:36:12,377
Which it may well be.

688
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,898
But it built these roads.

689
00:36:22,018 --> 00:36:23,858
Just come in, Roy.

690
00:36:30,098 --> 00:36:31,858
I'm sorry, OK?

691
00:36:33,338 --> 00:36:35,776
It was wrong to speak to you
like that and...

692
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:38,218
After the campaign,
I would've called you.

693
00:36:39,378 --> 00:36:41,337
After the campaign!

694
00:36:41,338 --> 00:36:43,498
All you've done
is strengthen Monroe.

695
00:36:44,618 --> 00:36:48,456
You won't win either, but I was
at least attempting to represent...

696
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:51,416
Well I don't know!
Not just "bollocks to everything".

697
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,096
If you were preaching revolution,
well that'd be something,

698
00:36:54,097 --> 00:36:57,178
but you're not because that would
require courage and a mindset.

699
00:36:58,418 --> 00:36:59,818
And what have you got?

700
00:37:01,378 --> 00:37:02,578
Who are you?

701
00:37:04,018 --> 00:37:05,618
What are you for?

702
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:13,858
Morning.

703
00:37:23,778 --> 00:37:25,657
So, final push.

704
00:37:25,658 --> 00:37:27,296
You remind everyone
that's got the app

705
00:37:27,297 --> 00:37:31,098
that if they recommend it to a friend
it unlocks a little fez for Waldo.

706
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:32,178
We're here.

707
00:37:35,058 --> 00:37:37,377
Attention, shoppers.

708
00:37:37,378 --> 00:37:40,778
I'm here to ask you an important
favour. Gather round.

709
00:37:40,779 --> 00:37:42,938
Come over here and listen.

710
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:48,577
Don't vote for me. I'm an insult.

711
00:37:48,578 --> 00:37:49,977
Seriously.

712
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:53,137
Vote for Monroe or Harris
or, I dunno, UKIP,

713
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:55,017
or even that Lib Dem guy.

714
00:37:55,018 --> 00:37:56,617
He's a prick!

715
00:37:56,618 --> 00:38:00,296
Seriously, only an arsehole
would actually vote for me.

716
00:38:00,297 --> 00:38:01,456
What is this? Irony?

717
00:38:01,457 --> 00:38:03,176
I'm worse than a wasted vote.

718
00:38:03,177 --> 00:38:04,896
He's from the Harris campaign.

719
00:38:04,897 --> 00:38:07,176
I mean it, you idiots!
Don't vote for me!

720
00:38:07,177 --> 00:38:09,378
Don't vote for me!
Don't vote for me!

721
00:38:09,379 --> 00:38:11,297
Don't vote for me!

722
00:38:11,298 --> 00:38:12,978
Don't vmmmf!

723
00:38:15,338 --> 00:38:16,497
Shut up.

724
00:38:16,498 --> 00:38:18,456
No. Don't boo him,
he's right! He's right!

725
00:38:18,457 --> 00:38:19,618
What are you doing?

726
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:21,138
- Resigning.
- Jamie!

727
00:38:22,738 --> 00:38:24,537
Look! It's me, I'm Waldo.

728
00:38:24,538 --> 00:38:27,697
This guy, whoever this guy is,
he's a hero.

729
00:38:27,698 --> 00:38:30,096
You should throw stuff at Waldo,
he's bad bloody news.

730
00:38:30,097 --> 00:38:31,456
- He's funny!
- He's not.

731
00:38:31,457 --> 00:38:34,016
Don't listen to that man,
he's a lesbian. Ahh!

732
00:38:34,017 --> 00:38:37,616
So remember, the polls are open,
and if you've got my app, you can

733
00:38:37,617 --> 00:38:40,978
unlock new stuff like catchphrases
and a little hat 'n' that.

734
00:38:40,979 --> 00:38:45,377
Only an idiot wouldn't vote for me
so question the status quo!

735
00:38:45,378 --> 00:38:46,617
Kill it! Kill it!

736
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:48,497
Kick them where it hurts.

737
00:38:48,498 --> 00:38:51,176
The first man to hit him
gets 500 quid!

738
00:38:51,177 --> 00:38:54,618
Yeah, that's right. Knock him down.
Knock him down.

739
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:56,057
Smash it!

740
00:38:56,058 --> 00:38:58,217
Yeah! Yeah!

741
00:38:58,218 --> 00:39:02,578
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah...

742
00:39:11,858 --> 00:39:13,136
