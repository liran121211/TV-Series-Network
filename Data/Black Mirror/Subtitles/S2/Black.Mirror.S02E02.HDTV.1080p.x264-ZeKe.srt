00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:15,401
Hello?

3
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:18,142
Ah...

4
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:25,182
Hello?

5
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:28,742
Hello.

6
00:04:57,342 --> 00:04:58,822
Can you help me?

7
00:05:00,702 --> 00:05:03,302
Do you know who I am? I... I...

8
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:08,182
I can't remember who I am.

9
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:28,141
Hello?

10
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:30,221
Do you know who I am?

11
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:31,661
Please!

12
00:05:31,662 --> 00:05:33,302
I can't remember.

13
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:14,622
Lady, help me!

14
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:17,581
Help me!

15
00:06:17,582 --> 00:06:18,782
Help me, please.

16
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:34,221
Oh! Help!

17
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:36,702
Help me. He's got a gun! Help me!

18
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:40,901
Hey! We have to go!

19
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:43,821
Come on!

20
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:45,222
Oh, my god! Help!

21
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:49,141
Oh, my god!

22
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,141
Stay back!

23
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:52,582
Back! Get back!

24
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:57,262
Get back. Back!

25
00:07:00,862 --> 00:07:02,022
Let me in. Let me in!

26
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:03,982
Help me! Help me!

27
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:11,982
Shit!

28
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:19,182
There's a door round there.

29
00:07:19,183 --> 00:07:20,261
It's locked.

30
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:21,260
You don't know that!

31
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:22,342
There's a keypad.

32
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:24,021
We should try it.

33
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:26,662
Get down! Anybody stands up,
they'll shoot their heads off.

34
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:30,141
He's trying to kill me!
What's going on?

35
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:32,100
Shut up! I'm trying to think!

36
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:33,462
He can see you. Get back.

37
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:39,421
Oh, my god!
What's wrong with those people?!

38
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:41,940
Why aren't they helping us?
They're just watching...

39
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:43,302
Where the fuck have you been?

40
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:44,581
What?

41
00:07:44,582 --> 00:07:46,662
Get that extinguisher.

42
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,021
I can't! I can't do it!

43
00:07:50,022 --> 00:07:51,621
Get it. Get it now!

44
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:54,181
OK... OK... OK...
OK... OK...

45
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,542
Come on.

46
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:58,782
Quickly. Slide it to me.

47
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:03,862
Damien, if he climbs through, you
grab him and you grab his gun.

48
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:04,861
I can't...

49
00:08:04,862 --> 00:08:05,621
You can.

50
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:06,781
He'll shoot me!

51
00:08:06,782 --> 00:08:08,141
You have to!

52
00:08:08,142 --> 00:08:11,460
I'm going to smash the lock off that
door, you help him with gun guy.

53
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:14,420
He can't shoot all of us.
If he fires, he has to reload.

54
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:16,222
We either rush him or run, OK?

55
00:08:16,223 --> 00:08:17,381
I can't do this!

56
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:19,341
We have no choice!

57
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:20,342
Help him.

58
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:23,381
Urgh!

59
00:08:23,382 --> 00:08:24,741
Damien!

60
00:08:24,742 --> 00:08:25,942
Oh, my...

61
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:28,702
Get him!

62
00:08:47,502 --> 00:08:48,502
Urgh! Urgh! Urgh!

63
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:04,341
Get down.

64
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:05,582
Shh!

65
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:10,342
Fuck!

66
00:09:17,702 --> 00:09:19,662
Shh!

67
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:49,662
No.

68
00:09:52,062 --> 00:09:54,222
We have to go, come on.

69
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:57,382
Shit.

70
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:00,062
Stay down.

71
00:10:02,142 --> 00:10:03,422
Shit.

72
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:06,862
Stay down.

73
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:15,980
Who are they?
Why do they look like that?

74
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:17,662
They like scaring people.

75
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:18,662
What?

76
00:10:19,982 --> 00:10:23,421
OK. We have to run for that opening.

77
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,061
No, they'll see us.

78
00:10:25,062 --> 00:10:27,342
If they're busy with him
we can lose the hunters, OK?

79
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:28,621
No.

80
00:10:28,622 --> 00:10:29,982
You just stay with me. OK?

81
00:10:29,983 --> 00:10:30,981
OK.

82
00:10:30,982 --> 00:10:32,262
Ready... Come on...

83
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:44,148
Wait.

84
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,708
Wait!

85
00:10:57,245 --> 00:11:00,043
The onlookers sometimes wait
in the windows, keeping lookout.

86
00:11:00,044 --> 00:11:03,843
I'm pretty sure that's how they find
us. Through the cameras somehow.

87
00:11:03,844 --> 00:11:06,803
Onlookers spot you and a few minutes
later the scary bastards turn up.

88
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:08,484
This is mad, this is just mad.

89
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:11,206
Hold it together and do
what I say or you'll get us killed.

90
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:13,445
I...

91
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:17,124
I woke up in this house and I don't
even know if it's my house.

92
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,926
I don't even know who I am.

93
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:20,605
You must know something.

94
00:11:20,606 --> 00:11:22,165
Ah!

95
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,365
I think this is my daughter.

96
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:26,148
But you don't know?

97
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:28,229
She could be anywhere.

98
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:32,909
Maybe you tried to kill yourself.
Would that explain it?

99
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,188
There was pills.

100
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:35,468
I don't blame you.

101
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:37,987
Lots have tried that fun
fork in the road since it started.

102
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,149
Since what started?

103
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:42,268
You really don't know?

104
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,748
No.

105
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:46,507
There was a signal... Like pictures,
flashing pictures.

106
00:11:46,508 --> 00:11:48,709
They just appeared on every TV,
every computer,

107
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,508
anything with a screen.

108
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,708
Argh!

109
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:55,028
Ugh!

110
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:56,869
I saw it. I saw it.

111
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:01,269
Get down.

112
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:06,028
They did something to people.

113
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,147
Like, almost everybody just became
onlookers,

114
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:11,027
started watching, filming stuff,

115
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:13,987
like spectators who don't give a
shit about what happens.

116
00:12:13,988 --> 00:12:16,009
That's, like, nine
out of ten people now.

117
00:12:16,073 --> 00:12:17,431
But not us.

118
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:19,470
Some of us weren't affected.
I don't know why.

119
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:21,830
Like that man with the gun
and that woman.

120
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:24,870
I call them "hunters". You might've
noticed that's what they do.

121
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:26,830
They seemed normal, but they
realised

122
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:28,430
they could do what they wanted

123
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:31,870
and they started taking stuff,
nicking cars cos they could,

124
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,990
doing what they like and not just
with things, with people.

125
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:38,310
It got worse and worse.
And now they've got an audience.

126
00:12:38,311 --> 00:12:40,712
So this... This thing on the TV,
the...

127
00:12:40,713 --> 00:12:41,911
The signal.

128
00:12:41,912 --> 00:12:44,350
That's what's making them act like
this?

129
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:46,550
I guess they were always like that
underneath.

130
00:12:46,551 --> 00:12:49,310
Just needed the rules to change,
for no-one to intervene.

131
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:51,712
What we going to do?
What we going to do?

132
00:12:51,713 --> 00:12:53,791
Do? Do nothing. We get out.

133
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:55,711
Where's "out"?

134
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:58,430
We're here.
We need to head south of here.

135
00:12:58,431 --> 00:13:00,792
They've knocked the transmitters
out, it's OK there.

136
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:03,231
The TV transmitters, they carry it.

137
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:04,510
There's only one between us

138
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:07,312
and the safe zone and we're going to
knock it out. See, it's here.

139
00:13:07,313 --> 00:13:08,432
White Bear.

140
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:13,231
What?

141
00:13:13,232 --> 00:13:14,392
White Bear...

142
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,671
Uh! Ungh!

143
00:13:21,672 --> 00:13:26,352
A picnic with my
two best friends.

144
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:34,030
Jesus, what is it with you?

145
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:35,912
White Bear, you said White Bear...

146
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:37,112
So?!

147
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:42,112
Look, whatever's wrong with you,
you have to keep it together. OK?

148
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,911
Listen to me! Don't go out there.

149
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:46,152
What's your problem?

150
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:49,591
Huh? You want something to look at?

151
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:51,592
Cos I'll give you something
to look at!

152
00:13:51,593 --> 00:13:53,392
No, I want to talk to him.

153
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:56,831
I want to talk to you!

154
00:13:56,832 --> 00:13:58,111
Ah!

155
00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:00,392
It's not so funny now, is it?

156
00:14:04,832 --> 00:14:05,832
Put it down.

157
00:14:07,592 --> 00:14:09,632
I just want to see what
they're looking at.

158
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:11,391
I said put it down.

159
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,270
It's dangerous.
Their phones, they're dangerous.

160
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,912
It's the signal. The images are
on them, they're on the screen.

161
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:18,391
What?

162
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:20,391
Don't look at it!

163
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,392
Don't look at it.

164
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,392
'Jemima...'

165
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:38,390
No, no. This is all wrong.
This is all wrong!

166
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:39,912
They're coming. Run! Run!

167
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,951
Get in.

168
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:53,352
Get in. Come on.

169
00:14:56,152 --> 00:14:57,352
Come on.

170
00:14:58,512 --> 00:15:02,071
Come on, now! They're coming!
Quick.

171
00:15:02,072 --> 00:15:04,352
Come on, hurry up. Get in.

172
00:15:16,392 --> 00:15:17,910
You nearly killed us back there.

173
00:15:17,911 --> 00:15:20,832
Yeah, well, I wasn't expecting you
to be there, was I?

174
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:25,231
I just saved your lives.
A wee 'thank you' would be nice.

175
00:15:25,232 --> 00:15:27,511
I should've just run yous over.

176
00:15:27,512 --> 00:15:28,951
Who are you?

177
00:15:28,952 --> 00:15:31,031
Who are you?

178
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:33,272
It's not a hard question, is it?

179
00:15:36,952 --> 00:15:39,031
I know... I know you.

180
00:15:39,032 --> 00:15:42,552
Do you? Well, where did we meet,
if you know me?

181
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,070
No. Didn't think so, yeah.

182
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:49,392
She's not in a good way.

183
00:15:49,393 --> 00:15:51,072
Yeah, I'll say.

184
00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:55,032
So what are yous doing out here
anyway?

185
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:56,791
Heading south.

186
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:59,110
That's not a good move.
It's all blocked up down there.

187
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:00,550
There's a transmitter there...

188
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:02,110
I don't think you understand.

189
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:04,112
When I said, "It's not a good move",

190
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:08,031
that means I'm not driving
you down there.

191
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:10,231
I know a safe place we can go.

192
00:16:10,232 --> 00:16:11,911
The woods.

193
00:16:11,912 --> 00:16:13,870
Your safe place is in the woods.

194
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:14,992
How'd you know that?

195
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,031
I don't... I don't know.

196
00:16:19,032 --> 00:16:20,832
Christ, maybe you do know me.

197
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:25,471
Yeah, we pull up and we get out.

198
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:27,352
We talk. There's no-one chasing us.

199
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,551
Mystic Meg.

200
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:29,832
And then what happens?

201
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,032
We eat.

202
00:16:44,592 --> 00:16:46,871
Told you. No bars.

203
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,472
They'll never find us here.

204
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:53,911
That your daughter?

205
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,551
Yeah, I think so.

206
00:16:55,552 --> 00:16:57,271
Where is she?

207
00:16:57,272 --> 00:16:58,631
I don't know.

208
00:16:58,632 --> 00:16:59,992
What'd you do to your wrists?

209
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:01,431
Don't know.

210
00:17:01,432 --> 00:17:03,352
History of mental illness?

211
00:17:05,072 --> 00:17:07,631
Yeah, I bet you do. Lay money on it.

212
00:17:07,632 --> 00:17:09,271
What about you?

213
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:10,391
What about me?

214
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:12,272
Mental illness, weaknesses...

215
00:17:13,752 --> 00:17:15,190
Everyone's got weaknesses.

216
00:17:15,191 --> 00:17:17,990
Yeah, you two have got more
that most, I'd say.

217
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:21,912
That's why you're on the receiving
end, you see. Vulnerable.

218
00:17:21,913 --> 00:17:24,031
Receiving end of what?

219
00:17:24,032 --> 00:17:28,471
This. Everything that's going on.
Easy pickings.

220
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:30,431
What's your weaknesses then?

221
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:31,831
My weaknesses?

222
00:17:31,832 --> 00:17:34,632
Show you if you want.
You want to see it?

223
00:17:35,672 --> 00:17:38,432
Wait there don't move.
You're going to like this.

224
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,631
Not a lot.

225
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:42,430
This better not be naturism.

226
00:17:42,431 --> 00:17:43,632
Yeah, in your dreams.

227
00:17:45,392 --> 00:17:46,711
Tada!

228
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:48,632
Run and I'll shoot you in the back.

229
00:17:51,392 --> 00:17:53,151
Right, come over here.

230
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:54,192
Stand there.

231
00:17:59,552 --> 00:18:01,991
You, here, put this on.

232
00:18:01,992 --> 00:18:05,392
Put it on. Backwards,
so it covers your eyes.

233
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:16,670
Put your hands on her shoulders.
Keep them there.

234
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:18,552
You're her eyes now, all right?

235
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:22,271
And that is a shotgun, OK?

236
00:18:22,272 --> 00:18:25,430
If I pull this trigger, it's going
to cut you, both in half.

237
00:18:25,431 --> 00:18:27,232
So no funny business, all right?

238
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:28,711
Right, off you go.

239
00:18:28,712 --> 00:18:31,952
Straight ahead.
Keep going through the trees.

240
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:37,231
Come on, pick up the pace.

241
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:40,110
Got a lovely
playground for you down there.

242
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:41,552
That's it, through here.

243
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:45,752
That's it, straight ahead.

244
00:18:51,872 --> 00:18:52,912
Grab her!

245
00:18:56,152 --> 00:18:58,272
Right, now take her balaclava off.

246
00:19:26,472 --> 00:19:27,672
Get down there.

247
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,032
Oh, fuck.

248
00:19:38,432 --> 00:19:39,352
Come on.

249
00:19:40,832 --> 00:19:42,392
Head towards that ladder.

250
00:19:46,112 --> 00:19:48,551
Get down there.

251
00:19:48,552 --> 00:19:52,192
Right, stop. Get on your knees, both
of you. Give me that bag.

252
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:54,231
Fucking bag.

253
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:55,632
You, get down.

254
00:19:56,952 --> 00:19:58,112
Stop whingeing.

255
00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:00,512
Stop fucking crying.

256
00:20:01,552 --> 00:20:03,631
Stop it. Eurgh!

257
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:05,388
Yeah.

258
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:09,626
I'm down in that wood spot.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Easy.

259
00:20:09,627 --> 00:20:11,866
I'll just lash them to a tree or
something like that.

260
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:14,006
Just hurry up and get down here.
I want to get started.

261
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:16,062
It's going to piss... Fuck!

262
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:26,204
Your mate's fucked off. You're in
double trouble now, missus.

263
00:20:26,205 --> 00:20:28,683
Get up on that log. Now! move!

264
00:20:28,684 --> 00:20:31,604
Get your hands through there.
Get your hands through there!

265
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,323
Right through.

266
00:20:33,324 --> 00:20:36,963
Push your arms up. Push them!

267
00:20:36,964 --> 00:20:38,484
Get them up there!

268
00:20:40,164 --> 00:20:45,323
Are we going to put a show on for
these guys today, eh?

269
00:20:45,932 --> 00:20:46,972
Eh?

270
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:53,954
Let's see what Daddy's got in the
bag, shall we? Oh...

271
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:58,114
Oh! Oh, mama.

272
00:20:58,115 --> 00:21:00,594
Help me! Help me!

273
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:02,914
Please, just help me!

274
00:21:02,915 --> 00:21:05,074
Why are you doing this to me?

275
00:21:05,075 --> 00:21:07,595
Whoa-ha! Oh yeah!

276
00:21:08,715 --> 00:21:12,314
Help me, please. I'm a human being!

277
00:21:12,315 --> 00:21:15,033
They're not going to help you.
They're going to watch.

278
00:21:15,034 --> 00:21:16,713
What I'm going to do here darling,

279
00:21:16,714 --> 00:21:19,075
is just going to push this
straight through your...

280
00:21:19,076 --> 00:21:22,355
Help me!

281
00:21:42,755 --> 00:21:46,134
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you!

282
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:47,911
For what?

283
00:21:47,912 --> 00:21:49,751
For coming back for me.

284
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:51,032
I came back for this.

285
00:21:57,832 --> 00:21:59,832
There's more like him on the way.

286
00:22:06,912 --> 00:22:08,152
Come on.

287
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,149
Whitebear's not far from here.

288
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,869
If we step on it we might be able
to shut it down before they get us.

289
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,815
- What happens if we can't shut it down?
- We can.

290
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,494
How? Do we hack into it,
or something?

291
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:08,880
We don't hack anything.
We burn the control room down.

292
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:11,722
It's not hard, we just slosh a load
of petrol round, strike a light

293
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,401
and fucks the electrics
or something.

294
00:23:14,402 --> 00:23:16,001
Here.

295
00:23:16,002 --> 00:23:17,322
In the bag.

296
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:20,922
It's the plans
for the transmitter compound.

297
00:23:23,242 --> 00:23:25,482
I've been planning this, you know.

298
00:23:31,882 --> 00:23:34,041
Jemima?

299
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:36,361
Lie down for me, darling. Go on.

300
00:23:36,362 --> 00:23:38,121
It's a game.

301
00:23:38,122 --> 00:23:40,242
Yeah, just like what Teddy does.

302
00:23:42,402 --> 00:23:43,882
Lie down for me, darling.

303
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:48,842
Turn around!

304
00:23:48,843 --> 00:23:49,881
What?

305
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:52,960
White Bear, there's something not
right about White Bear. I remember!

306
00:23:52,961 --> 00:23:56,202
You "remembered" the woods, too.
Sorry if I don't trust your hunches.

307
00:24:01,162 --> 00:24:03,442
OK. Looks clear.

308
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:18,682
OK.

309
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,882
He was good for something,
after all.

310
00:24:54,722 --> 00:24:57,321
Hurry up, we need to go!

311
00:24:57,322 --> 00:25:00,242
Come on... Get out...

312
00:25:01,802 --> 00:25:03,442
Come with me...

313
00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:14,362
A picnic with my two best friends.

314
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:18,882
Come on.

315
00:25:20,842 --> 00:25:22,122
This way.

316
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:30,920
Oh, shit. They'll be here
any minute. Give me the plan.

317
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:32,880
The transmitter tower's over there

318
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:35,642
and the cabling runs
underground into that building.

319
00:25:35,643 --> 00:25:37,242
Come on!

320
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:49,002
Thought so.

321
00:25:55,522 --> 00:25:56,642
Let's go!

322
00:27:14,562 --> 00:27:16,682
Get back.

323
00:27:17,962 --> 00:27:20,562
Or everything goes up.
I mean it... Stay back.

324
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,482
Stay back.

325
00:28:35,675 --> 00:28:38,035
Wh, wh, wha, what...?

326
00:28:41,195 --> 00:28:43,835
Thank you.

327
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:50,794
So. I guess you're wondering
why you're here?

328
00:28:50,853 --> 00:28:53,453
Well,
it's time to tell you who you are.

329
00:29:07,076 --> 00:29:08,956
You've looked better.

330
00:29:15,605 --> 00:29:16,805
Do you recognise him?

331
00:29:16,806 --> 00:29:18,484
Uh... Yeah.

332
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:21,364
Your fiance, lain Rannoch.

333
00:29:21,365 --> 00:29:23,845
Or, should I say, was your fiance.

334
00:29:29,285 --> 00:29:33,565
In case you haven't guessed,
the pair of you aren't very popular.

335
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:36,564
But I'll tell you what you are
though.

336
00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:37,924

370
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:15,805
Please!

371
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:25,565
Oh, don't start crying.
Crocodile tears are making me sick!

372
00:31:30,525 --> 00:31:32,004
Murderer!

373
00:31:32,005 --> 00:31:33,405
Murderer!

374
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:38,645
There were no tears
when you watched him do what he did.

375
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:42,324
You filmed what he did.
A poor wee girl.

376
00:31:42,325 --> 00:31:47,245
Helpless and terrified
and you just watched.

377
00:31:48,765 --> 00:31:50,325
How do you like it now?

378
00:31:55,085 --> 00:31:56,445
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?!

379
00:31:58,325 --> 00:31:59,925
Murderer!

380
00:32:03,445 --> 00:32:05,164
Murderer!

381
00:32:05,165 --> 00:32:06,765
Murderer!

382
00:32:15,285 --> 00:32:16,365
Get her out of here.

383
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:19,365
Throw her back
to where she came from.

384
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:28,645
No! No! Please...

385
00:32:31,765 --> 00:32:33,925
NO! Please!

386
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:42,245
Good evening, citizens!

387
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:47,804
Thank you so much
for coming tonight. OK!

388
00:32:47,805 --> 00:32:50,244
We're at the climax of our day.

389
00:32:50,245 --> 00:32:53,285
Take as many photographs as you
want, take as many photographs

390
00:32:53,286 --> 00:32:57,324
as you can, but most importantly,
what I need from you

391
00:32:57,325 --> 00:33:01,205
is to shout and scream and let that
bitch know that youse are out here.

392
00:33:03,445 --> 00:33:06,165
Let's get this show on the road!

393
00:33:14,205 --> 00:33:16,285
Murdering bitch!

394
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:20,045
Evil witch!

395
00:33:21,845 --> 00:33:24,524
Dirty whore!

396
00:33:24,525 --> 00:33:26,485
Burn the bitch!

397
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:39,844
Murderer!

398
00:33:39,845 --> 00:33:40,845
Burn in hell!

399
00:35:32,685 --> 00:35:36,165
Kill me. Please just kill me.

400
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:41,964
Please...

401
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:43,525
That's what you always say.

402
00:35:52,645 --> 00:35:54,324
♪ Doo-ba-doo-ba-do... ♪

403
00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:57,203
You've had a bad day,
but this will wipe it clean.

404
00:35:57,204 --> 00:35:58,645
Get you in the mood to start again.

405
00:35:58,646 --> 00:36:03,444
No! Please! Get off me!
What are you doing?

406
00:36:03,445 --> 00:36:05,045
Takes about 30 minutes...

407
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:12,124
for it to fully
do the business.

408
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:13,205
So while it does...

409
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:19,245
Why don't we watch
some in-flight entertainment?

410
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:20,965
Please, no.

411
00:36:24,405 --> 00:36:26,724
'Healthy stuff, like apples'.

412
00:36:26,725 --> 00:36:28,764
Please stop.

413
00:36:28,765 --> 00:36:31,484
You should enjoy this.

414
00:36:31,485 --> 00:36:32,844
You shot it.

415
00:36:32,845 --> 00:36:37,325
'Made it together,
so that my two friends...'

416
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:46,605
'Erm... A picnic for me
and my two best friends.'

417
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:17,165
Help me.

418
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:11,523
'OK everyone, we're about to head
into the park

419
00:38:11,524 --> 00:38:13,125
so I'll hand you over to Baxter.'

420
00:38:20,485 --> 00:38:21,644
Thank you.

421
00:38:21,645 --> 00:38:24,603
All of our roles are very,
very important, yours included.

422
00:38:24,604 --> 00:38:26,525
Now, yours come
with some basic rules.

423
00:38:26,526 --> 00:38:29,284
Rule number one, no talking,

424
00:38:29,285 --> 00:38:33,043
not just to her, but each other
as well, unless it's essential.

425
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:36,365
We're trying to get her to believe
that youse are all mesmerised.

426
00:38:37,405 --> 00:38:40,245
I know, I know, I know,
but she's believed it up to now.

427
00:38:43,005 --> 00:38:45,524
Morning, ticket please.
Thank you.

428
00:38:45,525 --> 00:38:48,764
'OK, rule number two,
keep your distance.'

429
00:38:48,765 --> 00:38:51,443
I can't stress the importance
of this one enough, OK?

430
00:38:51,444 --> 00:38:53,925
Don't forget,
she's a dangerous individual.

431
00:38:53,926 --> 00:38:57,084
Imagine that she's an escaped lion.

432
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,883
Now yesterday, she threw
a projectile, and we will step in

433
00:38:59,884 --> 00:39:02,763
if she gets too close.
We're all equipped with tasers,

434
00:39:02,764 --> 00:39:05,443
but then we're into story shutdown
and we've all wasted a day.

435
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:08,045
So it's best to keep your distance
at least three metres back.

436
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:10,045
You can use your camera zoom.

437
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:15,004
'Last, but not least,
enjoy yourself'.

438
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:17,803
That's probably the most
important rule of all, OK?

439
00:39:17,804 --> 00:39:20,963
Take photographs, run around through
the woods, but try and stay safe.

440
00:39:20,964 --> 00:39:23,405
We'll be keeping an eye on you,
making sure you're all OK.

441
00:39:23,406 --> 00:39:24,644
So get out there,

442
00:39:24,645 --> 00:39:28,285
enjoy yourselves and let's make
this show happen, people! Come on!

443
00:39:40,365 --> 00:39:42,485
Ow!

444
00:40:03,165 --> 00:40:04,525
Look, there she is.

445
00:40:10,445 --> 00:40:12,925
'Don't know yet.
I'm kind of knackered.'

446
00:40:12,926 --> 00:40:14,924
Me, too.

447
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:17,845
'She's just leaving her house now.
Two minutes tops.'

448
00:40:17,846 --> 00:40:20,525
Right, you are. We're on.

449
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:49,125
Watch out!

450
00:40:51,245 --> 00:40:54,443
He's trying to fucking kill me.
What's going on?

451
00:40:54,444 --> 00:40:55,925
'Get that extinguisher.'

452
00:40:58,365 --> 00:40:59,685
It's OK, they've gone.

453
00:41:01,445 --> 00:41:03,045
Convincing, eh?

454
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:12,125
We got two minutes.

455
00:41:20,525 --> 00:41:22,245
Help!

456
00:41:27,045 --> 00:41:28,805
Help me!

457
00:41:41,085 --> 00:41:42,564
'Early screamer.'

458
00:41:42,565 --> 00:41:48,645
It's an early screamer tonight.
So keep the noise up and let's go!

459
00:42:07,941 --> 00:42:08,941
Ow!
