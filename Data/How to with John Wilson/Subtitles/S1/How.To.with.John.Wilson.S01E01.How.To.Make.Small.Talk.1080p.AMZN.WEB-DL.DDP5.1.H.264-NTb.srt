had a pet that died?

502
00:24:21,297 --> 00:24:22,698
When I was a kid, yeah.

503
00:24:22,764 --> 00:24:24,030
JOHN: What was that pet?

504
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:25,331
His name was Lucky.

505
00:24:26,764 --> 00:24:29,164
He wasn't so lucky, though.
He got hit by a car.

506
00:24:30,364 --> 00:24:32,898
- JOHN: He got hit by a car?
- Yeah, I was a little boy, man.

507
00:24:39,597 --> 00:24:40,731
JOHN: Um...

508
00:24:42,764 --> 00:24:45,898
I, uh, I used to have a cat,

509
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:48,264
when I was growing up,
called... named Fluffy,

510
00:24:49,831 --> 00:24:50,831
and she died.

511
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:51,898
That sucks, bro.

512
00:24:51,931 --> 00:24:53,698
That's what happens.
That's life, though...

513
00:24:54,997 --> 00:24:56,397
unfortunately.

514
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:00,331
JOHN: I also had
a friend that died recently.

515
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:04,130
He was in, like, a car accident.

516
00:25:04,197 --> 00:25:05,364
That's terrible.

517
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:07,497
JOHN: Uh...

518
00:25:09,864 --> 00:25:12,431
and that was really hard.

519
00:25:12,497 --> 00:25:15,397
Yeah, I feel your pain,
trust me.

520
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,331
JOHN: Um...

521
00:25:19,297 --> 00:25:20,964
Yo, is this true?
Is this for real?

522
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,230
- JOHN: Yeah.
- I'm sorry, bro.

523
00:25:24,597 --> 00:25:26,531
My... my friend
just killed himself,

524
00:25:26,597 --> 00:25:27,764
before I came here.

525
00:25:28,631 --> 00:25:30,597
- JOHN: Before you came here?
- Well...

526
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,564
about 30 days before.

527
00:25:34,664 --> 00:25:38,731
Probably low-key why I...
Why I am out here, you know?

528
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:41,230
Whether I know it or not,
I think that the universe

529
00:25:41,297 --> 00:25:43,164
just put me here,
I don't really know.

530
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,164
I feel like I really needed
to get away.

531
00:25:51,164 --> 00:25:54,230
- JOHN: That's really heavy.
- Yeah, it's brutal.

532
00:25:54,297 --> 00:25:56,531
It's my first close friend
I ever really lost.
