John Wilson:
Hey, New York.

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,130
When you're young,
life is simple.

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,560
You don't have to worry
about dressing yourself.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,600
Your social life
is prearranged.

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,600
And you naturally get
plenty of exercise.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,260
But, as you get older,

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,500
you become responsible
for your own well-being.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,900
You start to eat
a lot of junk.

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,560
You sit around and get stoned
at home all the time.

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,660
And you drink a bunch
because it's the only way

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,360
you know how to be social.

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,160
But, after a while,

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,060
this lifestyle will start
to catch up with you.

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,100
You barely have any energy
to do anything.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,600
You're too weak
to defend yourself.

16
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,130
And you're so out of shape,
that people call you

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,960
really hurtful names.

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,830
And what was once
a fresh ball of clay

19
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,260
with unlimited possibility,

20
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,400
has hardened
into something disappointing.

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,560
And you no longer
like what you see

22
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,960
when you look in the mirror.

23
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,730
You were on a plane recently,
and during takeoff,

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,760
you had an unobstructed view
of the flight attendant.

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,130
You couldn't stop staring
at his biceps,

26
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,000
which looked like
they were about

27
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,730
to burst out of his uniform.

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,430

you could have those, too.

understood how to do it right.

38
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,460

of different gyms

to choose from in New York,

48
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,960
and thankfully, a lot of them
offer a free trial,

49
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,900
so you can take a tour
to see which you like best.

that you hate doing outside,

52
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,760
like walking up stairs,

53
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,700
rowing a boat,

54
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,730

You have a couple of pieces
of equipment at home

You also started smoking again
after a bad breakup,

having a gym membership

77
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,760

wanna work out.

But, you're just gonna
have to figure out

79
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,930
some way
to get yourself excited.

You spent an afternoon

with a compulsive
masturbator recently,

82
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,560
and you were curious
how he stayed so motivated.

83
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,660

is the main goal.

obviously, to finish,

87
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,030

88
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,700
Um, gooning is
riding that orgasm

89
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,160
without finishing.

90
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,030
Recently, it's evolved

91
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,300
into making these things
called "Goon Caps."

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,000
You write, like,
motivational text on it,

93
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,830
like, "Keep going!"
Or "You're doing great!"

94
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,960

It seems like having
someone else to motivate you

103
