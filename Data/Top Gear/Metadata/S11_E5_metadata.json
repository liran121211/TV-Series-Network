Since car magazines had feature ads that contained old, but classic, cars (worth the same as a Ford Mondeo), Jeremy and James are out to prove that you can buy old classic cars for \"Mondeo money\", should you consider paying the huge service bill. Jeremy and Richard are on a fox hunt, Top Gear style. Richard will be the hunter while Jeremy will drive a Daihatsu Terios which was painted to looked like a fox.\u2014snake6790"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1264801", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 263, "number_of_episodes": 328}
