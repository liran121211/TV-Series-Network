Instead of doing car news as they normally would, Hammond explained what happened before/during/after his horrific crash. The team also did a test of a new Jaguar & a challenge in which they had to complete road work within 24 hours instead of 5 days, which is how long it would normally take. While explaining what happened in his crash, Hammond requested that his crash not be brought up anymore, and as a result, this episode has never been aired again."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0946791", "rating": 8.4, "votes": 310, "number_of_episodes": 328}
