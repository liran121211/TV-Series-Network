It is a five-day expedition through the highest mountains, deepest gorges and harshest terrain on the planet. On their journey, the Top Gear presenters battle river crossings, mudslides and dizzying mountain passes on a trip that would test even the hardiest new 4x4s on the planet to the limit. But Paddy, Freddie and Chris aren't crossing the Himalayas in new 4x4s. They are crossing the Himalayas in a very small old Peugeot, a very small old Renault and Nepal's first (and only) home-built car."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "11517882", "rating": 6.3, "votes": 289, "number_of_episodes": 328}
