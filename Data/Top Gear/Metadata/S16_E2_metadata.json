Will it reach 60mph? Richard plays with a Porsche - again. This time, the new 911 Turbo S Cabriolet, which he races against a VW Beetle. A race with a Top Gear twist... Jeremy drives a practical car that you can afford - the Skoda Yeti, and puts it through some rather unusual tests. John Bishop is the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car.\u2014Anonymous"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1822119", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 323, "number_of_episodes": 328}
