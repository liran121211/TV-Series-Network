1
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:12,122
Tonight..

2
00:00:12,474 --> 00:00:14,872
James draws on a board,

3
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:18,328
Richard waves at a man,

4
00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:21,419
And I run away from a table.

5
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:30,990
Hello, everybody!
Hello and welcome!

6
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,827
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Now...

7
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:41,429
Now, I'm often asked, but sometimes I...
but actually I was once asked by one person

8
00:00:41,464 --> 00:00:45,848
why we review fast Vauxhalls so rarely on Top Gear.

9
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:48,912
The simple answer - they're terrible rubbish.

10
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:53,376
Vauxhall, however, has just introduced a new fast Astra

11
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:57,036
and says it isn't terrible rubbish.

12
00:00:57,076 --> 00:01:03,096
Hmmm.

13
00:01:03,136 --> 00:01:05,816
It's called the VXR and on paper,

14
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:11,628
it certainly appears to be terrible rubbish.

15
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:14,600
Because what they've done, bless them, is fit under the bonnet

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,252
of a front-wheel drive Vauxhall Astra,

17
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:23,128
a 276 horsepower engine.

18
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:32,220
That's as daft as fitting the heart- of an elephant in a mouse.

19
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,784
The thing is, the front wheels have to do the steering

20
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:37,220
and that's a big, important job.

21
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,628
And asking them to handle 276 horsepower as well,

22
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:49,940
means you've to do some very, very clever engineering.

23
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,128
Not that long ago,

24
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:55,752
Vauxhall was making the not-at-all cleverly engineered Vectra.

25
00:01:55,792 --> 00:02:02,564
The most dreary, uninspiring car in all of human history.

26
00:02:02,604 --> 00:02:05,220
Oh!

27
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,600
It really was a cure for ADD.

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,812
If you put a hyperactive child in there, he'd be asleep

29
00:02:09,852 --> 00:02:13,376
in three minutes flat. I mean, look at it!

30
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,812
It's as gripping as a Victorian novel,

31
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:18,656
as stylish as a taxman's trousers.

32
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:22,720
You almost got the impression they designed it in a coffee break.

33
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,812
Oh, quick, the boss wants a new car. There's one.

34
00:02:25,852 --> 00:02:27,160
Give it some fancy door mirrors.

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,936
It'll look like we made an effort. They hadn't!

36
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:33,908
So the idea that a company which did this,

37
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:38,596
now thinks it has the technical ability to put 276 horsepowers

38
00:02:38,636 --> 00:02:44,188
through the front wheels of a hatchback is laughable.

39
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:46,064
The thing is though, amazingly,

40
00:02:46,104 --> 00:02:56,064
they've pulled it off!

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,720
It has a clever front diff and unlike a normal Astra,

42
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,408
it has hydraulic power steering.

43
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:11,032
It also has the same sort of dampers that Ferrari use

44
00:03:11,072 --> 00:03:16,000
and James tells me it has separate hub carriers.

45
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,280
Which is interesting(!)

46
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,000
Plainly then, they've spent more time and effort on the front end

47
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,936
of this car, than they did on the whole of the Vectra.

48
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:32,064
And the rewards are huge.

49
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:35,876
There's no torque steer, there is no fuss, there is no drama,

50
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:40,752
the power is just there when you want it.

51
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:43,468
It might not be the most fun car in the world,

52
00:03:43,508 --> 00:03:46,216
it actually feels quite heavy,

53
00:03:46,256 --> 00:03:56,216
but, my God, it is quick!

54
00:03:57,256 --> 00:04:01,844
And best of all, despite extremely wide low-profile tyres,

55
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:06,752
it has a comfortable ride as well.

56
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:08,720
If you like being uncomfortable,

57
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,280
you can push this sport button here- which firms everything up

58
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,596
and if you want to feel like you're- falling down a rocky escarpment,

59
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:18,124
you can push this one.

60
00:04:18,164 --> 00:04:20,720
If you do that, watch, ready...

61
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,372
look, all the dials glow red

62
00:04:23,412 --> 00:04:26,656
to warn you that your neck is about to snap.

63
00:04:26,696 --> 00:04:32,064
Probably better to leave those buttons alone, clearly.

64
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:38,904
This is a damn good car. It's solid, good looking and very, very fast.

65
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:44,808
Plus, because it's a hatchback, it's practical as well.

66
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:47,248
There are, as I see it, only two problems.

67
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:52,876
One - at just shy of ï¿½27,000, it is quite expensive.

68
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:57,032
And two - when you are asked at parties what you're driving

69
00:04:57,072 --> 00:05:05,032
these days, you're going to have to start by saying... erm...

70
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,652
Perhaps then, we should look

71
00:05:06,692 --> 00:05:11,156
at the Astra's chief rival - the Ford Focus ST.

72
00:05:11,196 --> 00:05:14,468
This has five doors, so it is more practical than the Vauxhall.

73
00:05:14,508 --> 00:05:17,968
It's ï¿½5,000 cheaper and at parties,

74
00:05:18,008 --> 00:05:22,156
you can say you own a Ford without blushing.

75
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:28,000
But it simply isn't as nice to drive.

76
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,840
Instead of taming the front end with proper mechanical

77
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,156
engineering like Vauxhall did, Ford has used electronic systems

78
00:05:35,196 --> 00:05:40,436
and the truth is, they're not as good.

79
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:43,840
You can sense the electrons doing their absolute best to

80
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,876
keep things neat and tidy, but you can also sense them, erm...

81
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,876
..failing!

82
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,496
TYRES SCREECH

83
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:56,592
There's torque steer, there's understeer,

84
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:58,776
and then there's lift off oversteer.

85
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:06,120
There. It is a smorgasbord of waywardness.

86
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,120
I also have to say the Ford has a particularly unpleasant interior.

87
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,216
And it does not look very good from the outside either.

88
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:18,340
Nowhere near as good as the Astra, that's for sure.

89
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:28,340
So, as an enthusiast's car, I have to say the Vauxhall is better.

90
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:33,308
But this is Top Gear and I can't very well sit here

91
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:40,340
and say, "Hey, petrol heads, the best hot hatchback is a Vauxhall Astra."

92
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,464
That would be like a travel person saying, "Hey, holidaymakers,

93
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:50,512
"the best place for your summer vacation is Belgium!"

94
00:06:50,552 --> 00:07:00,404
So, let's keep going and look at another option.

95
00:07:00,444 --> 00:07:03,156
The Renault Megane 265.

96
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:06,280
This is the darling of all the car magazines.

97
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,464
They love it and it's easy to see why.

98
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:13,496
TYRES SCREECH

99
00:07:13,536 --> 00:07:23,120
TYRES SCREECH

100
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,716
You can just tell this car was designed by a team of people

101
00:07:26,756 --> 00:07:31,056
who really know what enthusiasts want when they're on the track.

102
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:39,464
It's sublime.

103
00:07:39,504 --> 00:07:42,308
They've even fitted it with a special readout that shows how fast

104
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:44,000
you went from 0 to 60,

105
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,368
how fast you did the standing quarter, your lap times,

106
00:07:47,408 --> 00:07:51,244
how much power you're using, how much brake you're using,

107
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:56,492
your throttle position, a graph, an extreme graph,

108
00:07:56,532 --> 00:07:58,904
your G metre.

109
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:02,120
The Stig just loves this.

110
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,464
He's been running around all morning squawking

111
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:06,808
and clutching at his tinkle!

112
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:11,620
And I have too, if I'm honest!

113
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:18,492
It's just an amazing combination of nimbleness and brute force.

114
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:21,308
There's no doubt that it's more exciting than the Vauxhall

115
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:28,056
and less wayward than the Ford and faster than both of them.

116
00:08:28,096 --> 00:08:31,088
To show you how much faster, I engaged sport mode

117
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:39,120
and pulled up for a drag race.

118
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:46,368
Watch and learn, Vauxhall!

119
00:08:46,408 --> 00:08:48,120
What?

120
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,808
Come on!

121
00:08:49,848 --> 00:08:52,840
Come on! Faster!

122
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:02,244
Come on-n-n-n!

123
00:09:02,284 --> 00:09:07,432
That was not supposed to happen.

124
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:11,432
Much to my surprise then, the Renault was the slowest.

125
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:13,492
And when you bear equipment levels in mind,

126
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:16,304
it is the most expensive, too.

127
00:09:16,344 --> 00:09:20,180
And it's also the least nice.

128
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,464
Sitting in here is a bit like sitting in Eeyore's gloomy place,

129
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:26,996
it is all very dark and everything you touch and everything you use

130
00:09:27,036 --> 00:09:32,040
feels flimsy, like it will come off- or break at any moment.

131
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,996
And the back's very cramped and the ride's very hard,

132
00:09:35,036 --> 00:09:38,024
this seat is very low down and very snug

133
00:09:38,064 --> 00:09:42,244
and gives you an idea of what it would be like to be buried alive.

134
00:09:42,284 --> 00:09:49,336
And look at this. You can't wear a pink shirt or it'll clash.

135
00:09:49,376 --> 00:09:52,560
So, while this may be the nicest car to drive on a track or

136
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,208
a deserted moorland road,

137
00:09:55,248 --> 00:10:00,804
it would not be the nicest to live with on a day-to-day basis.

138
00:10:00,844 --> 00:10:04,884
That means we arrive at a rather worrying conclusion because,

139
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:08,648
if I were to choose one of these three cars to drive home in tonight,

140
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:10,460
it would be...

141
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,960
the...

142
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,680
TONE SOUNDS

143
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,244
What happened there? The camera broke. Did it?

144
00:10:22,284 --> 00:10:25,208
Yeah, no, it literally just broke there. Did it?

145
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:29,208
And what were you about to say? Erm, I can't remember.

146
00:10:29,248 --> 00:10:32,804
You were about to say the Vauxhall. A bit.

147
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:35,976
It's a surprisingly likeable car. It just is.

148
00:10:36,016 --> 00:10:39,320
Isn't that a bit like saying Piers Morgan is a surprisingly

149
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,164
likeable man, but in the end, he is still fundamentally

150
00:10:42,204 --> 00:10:46,916
Piers Morgan, isn't he? Awful man. Yes, I know what you mean.

151
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:48,884
Look, hold on a minute.

152
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:51,664
The Ford is ï¿½5,000 cheaper, it is the most practical, with

153
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:56,352
the most doors and we've just seen it is the fastest. I'd have that.

154
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:59,568
There's a lot to commend the Ford. You're right. I like the Renault.

155
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:03,164
Oh God! This is brilliant buyers' advice, isn't it?

156
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,848
I'd have the Ford, you'd have the Renault,

157
00:11:04,888 --> 00:11:09,256
and he'd have the Piers Morgan. know how we can sort this out.

158
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:12,288
The tame racing driver.

159
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:16,256
Some say he contains 47% horse.

And that to concentrate more on his work here,

he's resigned, this week, from his other job in Rome.

I have the times here and they are not that fast.

188

The Ford Focus did it in 1.29.6.

189
00:12:50,984 --> 00:12:55,380
The Vauxhall Astra did a 1.28.3

190
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,456
and the Renault Megane,

191
00:12:57,496 --> 00:13:00,972
the most track-focused of them all,- did a 1.27.7.

192
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:03,068
So therefore, the conclusion is,

193
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:06,320
if you want a relatively inexpensive, fun car,

194
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,192
buy the Toyota GT 86!

LAUGHTER

196
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,048
We're really not much good at that consumer advice thing, are we?

197
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:19,756
Anyway, we must now do the news. Yes, and it's bad news!

198
00:13:19,796 --> 00:13:22,068
Dacia have got their name wrong.

199
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:24,040
Have you seen the car ads they've been doing?

200
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,128
They keep referring to themselves as Datcha.

201
00:13:26,168 --> 00:13:27,440
I think that's because

202
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,408
that's how you say it in Romania, where it's built.

203
00:13:30,448 --> 00:13:32,504
There's another labelling problem they've got,

204
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:34,376
because I was reading up on the new Sandero.

205
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,004
It says it's got 90 horsepower. With everything that's been going on,

206
00:13:37,044 --> 00:13:38,880
how do we know that isn't cow power?

207
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,224
Yeah. Good point.

208
00:13:41,264 --> 00:13:44,376
Because those abattoirs are in Romania,

209
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,880
allegedly. Apparently.

210
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,068
We went to Romania once and we did see a lot of people

211
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:52,252
riding around on cows, rounding up horses.

212
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:53,724
And all their farmers complaining about getting up early

213
00:13:53,764 --> 00:13:56,816
to milk the horses! Exactly.

214
00:13:56,856 --> 00:14:01,660
So, it is a 90 cow power car, we've established now. Good.

215
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,348
On the show, we've always said you can't be a proper petrolhead

216
00:14:04,388 --> 00:14:06,096
until you've owned an Alfa, which has always been

217
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,408
an embarrassing problem for me, because I haven't.

218
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:12,192
But that might be about to change with this, the Alfa Romeo 4C.

219
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:15,160
A little two seater, 1.8 litre turbocharged engine

220
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,348
mounted in the middle, chassis made of carbon fibre.

221
00:14:18,388 --> 00:14:22,688
At least it won't rust. They'll find a way.

222
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,880
They'll have bought cheap Russian carbon fibre that somehow oxidises.

223
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,848
You know what Alfa's like! How much is it?

224
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:30,284
It's going to cost between 40 and 50,000.

225
00:14:30,324 --> 00:14:32,320
I have a bit of a problem with that.

226
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,224
I don't think the looks are quite right. Eh? It's gorgeous.

227
00:14:35,264 --> 00:14:37,300
I think it's a bit too tall. Exactly. It is.

228
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,440
I'll tell you how it does look good- though, is if you see the plan view.

229
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,424
We've got one of those. Now that, I think, is good.

230
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:48,128
That's a view Hammond will never have! Oh, come on. Please!

231
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:52,252
Haa-haa! Open door. Yeah, all right.

232
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:55,864
Now the Ford Mustang we featured last week in the race across Europe,

233
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:58,600
that seems to have captured the hearts and minds of everybody, I mean, really.

234
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,096
Everywhere I've been, all week, people have been talking to me

235
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:04,408
about that car. Yeah, non-stop. Well, big news.

236
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:06,768
Ford has announced, because they've- never sold the Mustang

237
00:15:06,808 --> 00:15:09,784
officially in Britain, since 1964, they've announced that the

238
00:15:09,824 --> 00:15:12,628
next generation of Mustang coming next year, will be

239
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:16,000
built with right-hand drive and will be sold in Britain.

240
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,940
About time, brilliant, good news.

241
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,192
There is, however, a tiny bit of bad news. What?

242
00:15:21,232 --> 00:15:25,248
Well, the V8 version will be sold in America, but,

243
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:27,284
because we're only British,

244
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:30,752
all we can have is a two litre eco-boost engine.

245
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:34,096
Oh, for God's sake! Do they think we want that?

246
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:37,160
I can't understand their logic.

247
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,908
If you want a Mustang, it is because you want a big V8 muscle car,

248
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:41,880
there is no other reason for buying one. Precisely.

249
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,096
So if you want a two litre eco-boost car,

250
00:15:44,136 --> 00:15:46,220
you are going to buy a Golf diesel.- Not a Mustang.

251
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,188
It's like saying I formed a punk band,

252
00:15:48,228 --> 00:15:51,532
we got cellos, except for Sebastian, he has a harp.

253
00:15:51,572 --> 00:15:53,188
Nobody wants a harp in a punk band,

254
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:56,608
nobody wants a two litre eco-boost engine in a bloody Mustang.

255
00:15:56,648 --> 00:16:00,504
You can keep it, we don't want it. Just keep it. Keep them.

256
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:02,548
Now, the most important news of the week.

257
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,188
As you may have noticed, modern cars now have been given

258
00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:07,000
electronic handbrakes, rather than a lever. This is a problem,

259
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,220
because you can't do a handbrake turn with an electronic button.

260
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,316
And this is bad news,

261
00:16:13,356 --> 00:16:16,880
because handbrake turns are an essential part of male development,

262
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,160
because as we all know,

263
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,488
the handbrake lever is connected directly to a girl's sexual appetite!

264
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:28,204
It is. It is. When you're 17, it is. You're smiling and you know it is.

265
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:31,016
You see it in the animal kingdom. A peacock has his feathers.

266
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:35,032
The young man has his handbrake. Exactly. They do the same job.

267
00:16:35,072 --> 00:16:37,408
And if you have a button, it doesn't work. No.

268
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:41,160
I can remember my first attempt at seduction with the handbrake

269
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,564
when I was 17 years old.

270
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:44,784
I was going to pick up this girl called Liz from outside a pub

271
00:16:44,824 --> 00:16:46,092
and I had it all planned.

272
00:16:46,132 --> 00:16:48,468
I'd go in and I'd get on the handbrake and slew it round

273
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:52,140
like the Italian Job and the rest was a formality, obviously.

274
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,064
I went through the gate, quite hot,- pulled on the lever and that was

275
00:16:55,104 --> 00:16:56,656
when the cable snapped.

276
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:58,576
LAUGHTER

277
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:01,704
I think it was because I had spent the previous day practising,

278
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:05,048
you see... Only you would practise a handbrake turn! You have to.

279
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:08,528
Wish I had. What? I remember taking- a girl called Cathy home one night.

280
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:11,048
I was 17, in my mum's Audi.

281
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:13,280
And she lived in the middle of a field and I do mean

282
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,124
in the middle of a field, no tracks, anything.

283
00:17:15,164 --> 00:17:16,688
Was she called Ermintrude?

284
00:17:16,728 --> 00:17:18,608
LAUGHTER

285
00:17:18,648 --> 00:17:23,064
Did she wear a nice big bell? No, she wasn't a cow! Moo. Or a horse.

286
00:17:23,104 --> 00:17:25,316
No, no.

287
00:17:25,356 --> 00:17:28,440
Anyway, I am going down the grassy hill, to the house and thought,

288
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,500
I know what will tip her over the edge. Brrt!

289
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:37,452
Pirouetted straight through her dad's hedge. Was she impressed?

290
00:17:37,492 --> 00:17:44,160
I know she was, because she pulled a face that was exactly like this.

291
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,688
That's the face, that's the face they pull

292
00:17:45,728 --> 00:17:47,000
in that part of the mating ritual.

293
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,312
I know, because I have seen that face.

294
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:51,844
When I was a young man, 17, borrowing my dad's car,

295
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:54,484
diesel Astra estate,

296
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:56,496
and I was giving Katie from college a lift home, she lived on a farm,

297
00:17:56,536 --> 00:17:59,160
down farm tracks and I had already warmed her up

298
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,496
with a bit of rally driving!

299
00:18:02,536 --> 00:18:05,484
There was already a sexual tension in the car.

300
00:18:05,524 --> 00:18:08,264
And I thought, "I'll seal the deal with the handbrake lever,"

301
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:11,800
yanked it on, slewed round, hit a rock. She pulled that exact face.

302
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,468
What, the...? Sometimes girls say, "What did you do that for?"

303
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:20,516
That's it. What they're actually saying is, "I'm ready!"

304
00:18:20,556 --> 00:18:25,184
But I never got that face from Liz,- because as far she was concerned,

305
00:18:25,224 --> 00:18:27,484
she didn't know I had tried to do a- handbrake turn, because

306
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:30,344
I had just got that twang, that was- the only twang I got

307
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:33,372
on that evening! As far as she could see,

308
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:37,108
I had just parked badly the wrong way round.

309
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:41,216
She just thought I was an cars. think I know why they're doing this.

310
00:18:41,256 --> 00:18:45,808
It's to cut down on unwanted teenage pregnancy.

311
00:18:45,848 --> 00:18:47,984
And it could work. It's a clever thought.

312
00:18:48,024 --> 00:18:52,088
It'll probably work, but it'll also- cut down on the future of mankind.

313
00:18:52,128 --> 00:18:54,124
I think it is irresponsible. If you think about it,

314
00:18:54,164 --> 00:18:58,720
if a man can't use a handbrake to pull a girl, what's he going to do?

315
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,012
There's going to be a lot of frustrated men around.

316
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:05,984
You may have to talk to her.No! No! Car makers, please, stop it.

317
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:11,824
You're meddling with forces unseen and more powerful than you.

318
00:19:11,864 --> 00:19:14,608
Shall we get back to cars? Yeah, let's do it.

319
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:17,420
Peugeot, as we know, are the worst driven cars on the road,

320
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,952
always doing 40 in the outside lane, they're always in your way.

321
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:24,156
But now there is a new car from Peugeot. We have it here

322
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:29,448
in the studio. It's called the Onyx. It looks absolutely fantastic

323
00:19:29,488 --> 00:19:34,216
and you'll notice that some of the bodywork is made from copper.

324
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:38,340
Just like the boiler tubes on a Gresley A4 Streamliner Pacific.

325
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,668
Yes, James, yes, yes.

326
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:44,668
And it's actually untreated copper,- so over time, it'll turn green

327
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:49,464
unless a scrap metal merchant removes it in the night.

328
00:19:49,504 --> 00:19:52,496
Inside they've continued the theme of using unusual materials,

329
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:57,572
so the dashboard is made out of recycled newspaper.

330
00:19:57,612 --> 00:19:58,824
I'm guessing they'll have used the Guardian for everything

331
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,932
on the left and the Telegraph for everything on the right!

332
00:20:01,972 --> 00:20:04,264
Actually the newspaper is goodbecause it means there is no need to

333
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:10,308
Bluetooth your phone to it. The dashboard will already havelistened to your messages for you.

334
00:20:10,348 --> 00:20:16,212
The engine is 680 horsepower V8 turbo diesel hybrid.

335
00:20:16,252 --> 00:20:21,572
That means a top speed in the outside lane of 40.

336
00:20:21,612 --> 00:20:25,920
Anyway, this is the future, perhaps, but now we must return to

337
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,824
the present, because we have some important information.

338
00:20:28,864 --> 00:20:32,932
The Kia Cee'd, which we use as our reasonably priced car

339
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:42,932
has been updated and the new version is taking the world by storm.

340
00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:46,872
This is it.

341
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,604
It has only been on sale for eight months

342
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:54,152
and already it has won the coveted Northern Car Of The Year award.

343
00:20:54,192 --> 00:20:56,168
A chap called Derek Grocock

344
00:20:56,208 --> 00:21:00,168
who is vice chairman of the Northern Group Of Motoring Writers

345
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:04,044
said it had impressed the judges with its comfort, value,

346
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:11,104
reliability, quality, and its seven-year warranty.

347
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,620
But this is Top Gear and we are interested in,

348
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:20,824
all of that obviously, but rather more besides.

349
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:30,824
So now let's see how well it does at all the things that matter to us.

350
00:21:36,424 --> 00:21:40,792
Of course there is only one man we can turn to for an answer. Matt LeBlanc,

351
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:45,088
the fastest star we have ever had in our reasonably priced car.

352
00:21:45,128 --> 00:21:47,400
Of course Matt lives in Los Angeles

353
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:57,400
but he appreciated the importance of the question.

354
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:09,808
First, the old car.

355
00:22:09,848 --> 00:22:19,808
Old versus new. The age-old question.

356
00:22:26,456 --> 00:22:30,088
And now, the new version.

357
00:22:30,128 --> 00:22:40,088
Ah, that new-car smell. Huh?

358
00:22:47,968 --> 00:22:54,208
So there we are.

359
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:57,152
Thanks a lot. Thank you. Any time.

360
00:22:57,192 --> 00:23:07,152
With Matt gone I moved on to a test- I could handle myself.

361
00:23:10,204 --> 00:23:15,180
I'm coming up now to a row of parked cars in a top-of-the-range Cee'd

362
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,792
which has this little button down here.

363
00:23:17,832 --> 00:23:22,884
If I push it, sensors start to scan- the gaps to see if any of them

364
00:23:22,924 --> 00:23:31,008
are big enough for me to park in. What about this gap here?

365
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:33,164
I don't think that's big enough. Does the car agree?

366
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:36,244
It will "bong" if it thinks it's big enough. It didn't like that.

367
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:39,180
What about this one?

368
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:39,996
BONG

369
00:23:40,036 --> 00:23:41,848
There it is.

370
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:45,480
Now that's very impressive. But what it does next is even better.

371
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,928
If I put it in reverse I am told this will go into that gap

372
00:23:50,968 --> 00:23:53,916
with no steering input at all from me.

373
00:23:53,956 --> 00:23:58,352
To see if that is true I am going to wear a blindfold. OK.

374
00:23:58,392 --> 00:24:05,536
I can now see nothing at all. Here we go.

375
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:12,712
Easing it backwards. Hands not on the wheel. Oh, my God, it's turning.

376
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:16,556
This is spooky.

377
00:24:16,596 --> 00:24:19,772
I'm going to get some beeps to tell me when

378
00:24:19,812 --> 00:24:20,804
I'm close to the car behind.

379
00:24:20,844 --> 00:24:23,896
BEEPS There we are.

380
00:24:23,936 --> 00:24:26,524
Then I put it in drive.

381
00:24:26,564 --> 00:24:31,460
This...LAUGHS

382
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,584
This is weird now.

383
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:44,584
If I take this off and I am parked I shall be amazed.

384
00:24:44,844 --> 00:24:46,256
SILENCE

385
00:24:46,296 --> 00:24:53,896
So now let's consider some rather more important questions.

386
00:24:53,936 --> 00:24:58,864
Yes.

387
00:24:58,904 --> 00:25:00,740
MUSIC: "Layla"by Eric Clapton

388
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,556
We plugged the lead into the auxiliary socket

389
00:25:02,596 --> 00:25:07,768
and asked a local guitarist to try it out.

390
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:17,768
HE PLAYS LAYLA

391
00:25:18,248 --> 00:25:22,788
He seemed quite impressed.

392
00:25:22,828 --> 00:25:25,648
So far then the little Kia is passing all our tests

393
00:25:25,688 --> 00:25:29,084
and passing them well,

394
00:25:29,124 --> 00:25:34,848
but I know what you're thinking.

395
00:25:34,888 --> 00:25:39,408
This is a big problem because if you have your container of water

396
00:25:39,448 --> 00:25:43,008
for the eel and even a small amount of sodium -

397
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:45,444
I've only got 100 grams here - and the two were to

398
00:25:45,484 --> 00:25:50,240
come into contact with one another,- the results could be catastrophic.

399
00:25:50,280 --> 00:26:00,240
As I shall now demonstrate.

400
00:26:04,904 --> 00:26:08,612
Time and time again we hear about eel and sodium salesmen

401
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:15,836
going about their business when all of a sudden...

402
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:22,972
..their car explodes.

403
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:26,332
To make sure that doesn't happen in the Cee'd, special segregated

404
00:26:26,372 --> 00:26:29,864
trays are fitted underneath the boot floor

405
00:26:29,904 --> 00:26:32,568
so you can have your sodium in one tray,

406
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:38,444
separated from the water into which- I am now going to place an eel.

407
00:26:38,484 --> 00:26:42,944
There we go. Don't jiggle about. You'll get water on the sodium.

408
00:26:42,984 --> 00:26:49,600
That's what happened to your mum. Stay. Good eel. Excellent.

409
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,144
Now we will just close the boot floor.

410
00:26:53,184 --> 00:27:01,972
That really is an intelligent piece of design.

411
00:27:02,012 --> 00:27:03,928
So now let's look at another vital issue that was not

412
00:27:03,968 --> 00:27:11,456
addressed by Mr Grocock.

413
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:21,456
HORN BEEPS

414
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:26,348
Yes, he can.

415
00:27:26,388 --> 00:27:28,144
And he managed to do that without getting any more

416
00:27:28,184 --> 00:27:35,784
blood or oil on his shirt.

417
00:27:35,824 --> 00:27:45,440
Yes it is. A mid-range 1.6 litre Kia is 17,195. A mid-range 1.6 litre Focus, 17,200.

418
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,800
For the price of the Focus you can have a Kia

419
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,488
plus ï¿½5 to spend on...

420
00:27:53,528 --> 00:27:59,628
..ï¿½5 worth of things.

421
00:27:59,668 --> 00:28:02,036
There was a time when Kias were cheaper than their European

422
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:07,704
rivals because they were very nasty, but those days have gone.

423
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:10,116
This really is not nasty at all.

424
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:11,864
I think it is good looking on the outside,

425
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,268
good looking on the inside as well.

426
00:28:14,308 --> 00:28:17,036
It has sophisticated independent rear suspension

427
00:28:17,076 --> 00:28:21,328
so you can stick it into a corner pretty confident that you

428
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:24,396
will come out OK on the other side.

429
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,036
It is well-equipped.

430
00:28:26,076 --> 00:28:32,360
And it has passed nearly all of our tests with flying colours.

431
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:42,360
The Kia Cee'd - good enough for Mr Grocock and good enough for Top Gear.

432
00:28:47,904 --> 00:28:54,784
Very thorough. Very, very thorough. A lot of information there.

433
00:28:54,824 --> 00:28:56,892
A lot of important information.

434
00:28:56,932 --> 00:29:00,160
Yes, absolutely,but for me the most impressive thing- was that parking system. I know.

435
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,768
That is uncanny.

436
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:03,736
Although I should say in fairness you can also get that

437
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:08,452
system on Fords and Volkswagens and Toyotas these days.

438
00:29:08,492 --> 00:29:11,752
Yes, anyway, between you and Mr Grocock, Eric Clapton...

439
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,112
Brue Willis...

440
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:15,848
..and Matt LeBlanc, that is the Kia completely covered.

441
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,736
No, not quite,

442
00:29:17,776 --> 00:29:21,656
because there is one more important- question we have to deal with.

443
00:29:21,696 --> 00:29:25,656
Is there? Is it, "Can a badger drive it?"

444
00:29:25,696 --> 00:29:27,548
That is a good idea, but no.

445
00:29:27,588 --> 00:29:30,580
It is, "Can you play rugby in it?" Rugby?

446
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,548
Yes, rugby. If you are watching in America, rugby is

447
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:35,968
a bit like American football only it's played by men.

448
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:38,172
LAUGHTER

449
00:29:38,212 --> 00:29:40,564
And you are going to try and play it in a car?

450
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:42,172
Yes, it is one of the most ambitious

451
00:29:42,212 --> 00:29:45,736
things we have ever attempted and we will see how it does later on.

452
00:29:45,776 --> 00:29:49,956
Now, though, it is time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.

453
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,240
My guest tonight is a young chap from Hertfordshire

454
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,924
who recently got a new Mercedes and wants to come and tell us

455
00:29:54,964 --> 00:29:58,472
all about it. Normally we would tell him to get lost.

456
00:29:58,512 --> 00:30:01,844
But we decided to make an exception on this occasion

457
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:04,016
because...

458
00:30:04,056 --> 00:30:12,328
his name, ladies and gentlemen, is Lewis Hamilton.

459
00:30:12,368 --> 00:30:16,032
Great! You are back. You are back. Good to see you.

460
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:20,440
Lewis is among us.

461
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:27,596
Have a seat. Have a seat. It feels good to be back. Luxury.

462
00:30:27,636 --> 00:30:30,624
Obviously the first question is the big one.

463
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:34,908
You have moved from McLaren to Mercedes.

464
00:30:34,948 --> 00:30:41,032
Is that not a bit like moving from Manchester United to West Ham?

465
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:44,800
Firstly, thanks for the warm welcome, everyone. Don't change the subject.

466
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,656
Good to be back.

467
00:30:46,696 --> 00:30:49,408
Yes, no, it's a big change for me obviously,

468
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,160
but I'm really excited about it.

469
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,528
Everyone is criticising it and has their own opinions but for me

470
00:30:55,568 --> 00:30:57,904
I have been at McLaren since I was 13.

471
00:30:57,944 --> 00:31:03,280
It was a long period there and I wanted a change. I am a risk taker.

472
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,904
There is a risk and a risk because McLaren have won, what, 182 races.

473
00:31:06,944 --> 00:31:13,372
Mercedes has won...one in five years. What makes you think...?

474
00:31:13,412 --> 00:31:17,936
Well, they won the Championship. Well, it was actually Brawn... Brawn. Technically not...

475
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:24,064
Have they told you that? "We've won. We've won." You are right.

476
00:31:24,104 --> 00:31:26,496
They have struggled the last few years, but I think

477
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:31,496
when the rules came out in 2009, everyone came out with the design of a car and

478
00:31:31,536 --> 00:31:34,560
they started out, and every year after that it is an evolution of that car.

479
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,808
And they started off on the wrong foot and they've been on the wrong foot since then.

480
00:31:38,848 --> 00:31:44,576
One of the things I thought, you had to do a lot of PR work at McLaren, didn't you? Mm.

481
00:31:44,616 --> 00:31:47,092
Everybody knows that is dreadful. Yeah.

482
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:49,468
"Buy this terrible thing that sponsors our car."

483
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:52,216
Is there going to be less of that? A lot less, yes. A lot less? Yes.

484
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:54,688
That is good enough. Why did you not just say because you have to do less

485
00:31:54,728 --> 00:31:56,688
standing around talking rubbish? It's not that.

486
00:31:56,728 --> 00:32:00,184
There were so many good things about the opportunity to go

487
00:32:00,224 --> 00:32:02,560
somewhere where they are struggling- and hopefully be

488
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,344
a part of something that will get somewhere and become great.

489
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:07,372
Michael did it years ago with Ferrari.

490
00:32:07,412 --> 00:32:10,800
No other driver has done that really, so I want to do something like that.

491
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,936
So we needn't expect to see you

492
00:32:12,976 --> 00:32:14,688
leading everybody around from pole position?

493
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:17,808
You definitely should not expect that this year.

494
00:32:17,848 --> 00:32:21,060
Because initial testing has not been completely successful so far? No.

495
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,124
It wasn't good. Brake failure on my- 14th lap. What speed? Pretty fast.

496
00:32:25,164 --> 00:32:28,372
Yeah. I was at the end of the back straight going into turn six

497
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:32,608
and hit the brakes at 180 mph, 190,- and then nothing happened.

498
00:32:32,648 --> 00:32:34,044
I just went straight in...

499
00:32:34,084 --> 00:32:35,484
So when you put your foot on the brake pedal

500
00:32:35,524 --> 00:32:39,496
and you're going 180 and nothing happens. Poo?

501
00:32:39,536 --> 00:32:46,824
No, you do swear though. You have time to think of a swear word? Yes, you do.

502
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,764
And you have time to brace. Do you?

503
00:32:48,804 --> 00:32:51,060
Yes, so I was going towards the wall and

504
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,136
I remember just holding on for dear- life knowing it was going to hurt.

505
00:32:55,176 --> 00:32:58,012
Did it hurt? It did. Particularly in my legs.

506
00:32:58,052 --> 00:33:00,360
For some reason, I don't know, I went in straight ahead,

507
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,728
but my legs seem to hurt when I go straight into a wall.

508
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,200
Now, I do know what I need to talk to you about.

509
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,952
The handbrake in the modern car.

510
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:19,572
Have you ever thought, "If I pull this, she...?" I am sure I have.

511
00:33:19,612 --> 00:33:25,136
In the first years that I was driving, I'm sure.

512
00:33:25,176 --> 00:33:28,108
We were discussing this earlier. It is one of the weirdest things.

513
00:33:28,148 --> 00:33:30,028
We are all fairly clear, girls don't like men who do

514
00:33:30,068 --> 00:33:33,776
handbrake turns, but we think they do. My girlfriend loves it.

515
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:37,888
Does she? I have a good story about my handbrake turns.

516
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:42,776
Years ago I was at a karting race in Italy with Nico as my team mate.

517
00:33:42,816 --> 00:33:44,368
It was 2000.

518
00:33:44,408 --> 00:33:46,652
Me, my dad and Keke Rosberg,

519
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:50,964
were on our way to the track and my dad was driving down this

520
00:33:51,004 --> 00:33:53,652
country lane, which off the edge of the road drops down into a field

521
00:33:53,692 --> 00:33:55,776
and there is a metre drop.

522
00:33:55,816 --> 00:33:58,368
Keke all of a sudden just pulls the- handbrake while my dad is driving.

523
00:33:58,408 --> 00:34:02,872
And my dad doesn't really know how to drive that well.

524
00:34:02,912 --> 00:34:06,776
He thinks he's a great driver... He's not here to argue.

525
00:34:06,816 --> 00:34:09,560
Lost the back end of the car and put it down into the ditch

526
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,000
and we had to leave it there and walk to the track.

527
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,152
There wasn't even a girl in the car? Who was Keke trying to impress?

528
00:34:17,192 --> 00:34:26,436
I don't know. Your dad. My dad, yes. Keke is gay!

529
00:34:26,476 --> 00:34:33,152
And on that bombshell...

530
00:34:33,192 --> 00:34:34,932
Now, I know that you have been very much looking forward to

531
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:39,872
coming back here. Yes, I have. have been here before. Yes, 2008.

532
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:44,212
Now most guests do a lap, take the weather on the chin,

533
00:34:44,252 --> 00:34:48,560
snow, ice, rain, and then go away. You did not do that.

534
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,920
You were cross, weren't you? I was not happy that it was raining.

535
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,964
It was wet. I am told that you took our producer around the back...

536
00:34:58,004 --> 00:35:01,136
LAUGHTER

537
00:35:01,176 --> 00:35:03,948
..and a deal was done that you could come back and try again

538
00:35:03,988 --> 00:35:09,604
when the track was dry. Yes. This was a bloody quick time. 1.44.

539
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:16,920
And it was wet. Wet and oily. Oily, was it? Get it right. Yes.

540
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,560
Racing drivers' excuses, but... I thought wet was all it said, but it's wet and oily.

541
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,184
Wet and oily, you said.

542
00:35:23,224 --> 00:35:24,996
You said someone in the last corner dumped some oil.

543
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:28,336
It had come out of Hammond's hair.

544
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:32,400
Obviously, thorn in your side here,- Sebastian sits at the top.

545
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,480
That irritates you? Mm-hm.

546
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,760
He's had the best car for God knows how many years

547
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,588
and is also the quickest on Top Gear, so... You wanted to come and do something about that?

548
00:35:42,628 --> 00:35:43,996
Every driver wants...

549
00:35:44,036 --> 00:35:46,648
I remember when Rubens came and did the time.

550
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:50,792
We went to a drivers' briefing in Germany. He brought everyone a shirt.

551
00:35:50,832 --> 00:35:57,184
He gave himself, "I beat The Stig" and everyone else "The Stig beat me."

552
00:35:57,224 --> 00:36:00,336
So you didn't do your lap today? No.

553
00:36:00,376 --> 00:36:02,808
You came down and did the lap many months ago.

554
00:36:02,848 --> 00:36:04,808
Who would like to see Lewis practising for his lap?

555
00:36:04,848 --> 00:36:06,560
AUDIENCE: Yes

556
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,184
Let's have a look.

557
00:36:09,224 --> 00:36:13,304
There he goes. Second to last corner catches all of our guests out,

558
00:36:13,344 --> 00:36:19,276
including one Lewis Hamilton.

559
00:36:19,316 --> 00:36:25,464
Was that me? Yes.

560
00:36:25,504 --> 00:36:27,588
I only put it on to make all the other guests feel better

561
00:36:27,628 --> 00:36:29,636
because they are like, "No, I have spun off."

562
00:36:29,676 --> 00:36:33,464
Now they can go, "At least Lewis Hamilton did exactly the same- thing in exactly the same place."

563
00:36:33,504 --> 00:36:37,304
Nevertheless, you then lined up to do your lap again.

564
00:36:37,344 --> 00:36:39,680
Who here would like to see it? AUDIENCE: Yes.

565
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,840
Here we go.

566
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,996
It is, of course, the old Liana.

567
00:36:46,036 --> 00:36:47,336
That was a good gear change.

568
00:36:47,376 --> 00:36:51,276
Come on, baby!

569
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:53,664
Yes, we do not use the Cee'd for Formula One drivers.

570
00:36:53,704 --> 00:37:00,772
You all have to drive that. It's nice to see it back looking tall and ungainly and slow.

571
00:37:00,812 --> 00:37:06,088
HE HUMS

572
00:37:06,128 --> 00:37:08,616
'I thought you were determined to go fastest?'

573
00:37:08,656 --> 00:37:12,804
'I was.' 'Singing. It's like Kimi Raikkonen looking at the planes.'

574
00:37:12,844 --> 00:37:14,304
Whoo!

575
00:37:14,344 --> 00:37:17,304
'Look where you're going.

576
00:37:17,344 --> 00:37:20,492
'Is this the sort of man who looks like he's determined

577
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:23,352
'to go faster than Sebastian Vettel?'

578
00:37:23,392 --> 00:37:26,148
'Look at that, I didn't even cut the corner.' 'I'm very impressed.'

579
00:37:26,188 --> 00:37:28,804
Not surprised, but I'm very impressed.

580
00:37:28,844 --> 00:37:30,712
'Here we go.'

581
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:34,336
HE SHOUTS

582
00:37:34,376 --> 00:37:39,336
'That was to the cameraman.' 'I know.'

583
00:37:39,376 --> 00:37:43,648
'That was close to the tyres.'

584
00:37:43,688 --> 00:37:48,132
'A couple of bites at the cherry. That's nicely done.'

585
00:37:48,172 --> 00:37:51,616
'It actually looks like it handles quite well, bless it.' 'It does.'

586
00:37:51,656 --> 00:38:01,616
'And there we are, everyone, across the line.'

587
00:38:06,408 --> 00:38:10,836
There is no point asking you where you want to come. You know. You know where you want to be.

588
00:38:10,876 --> 00:38:17,488
Well, Lewis Hamilton. Mm-mm. It was a 1.44 that Sebastian did.

589
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:24,368
Lewis Hamilton, you did it in... one...

590
00:38:24,408 --> 00:38:30,084
42.

591
00:38:30,124 --> 00:38:32,488
CHEERING

592
00:38:32,528 --> 00:38:37,272
Unbelievable. Unbelievably fast time.

593
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,864
Wa-hey!

594
00:38:38,904 --> 00:38:44,960
I will leave it there.

595
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:52,864
You weren't even concentrating.

596
00:38:52,904 --> 00:38:56,272
Wow. Holy crap. Pleased? I'm really surprised.

597
00:38:56,312 --> 00:38:58,816
It didn't even look like you were concentrating. I was.

598
00:38:58,856 --> 00:39:00,896
It has been months and you guys wouldn't even tell me.

599
00:39:00,936 --> 00:39:02,896
No, we never tell anybody.

600
00:39:02,936 --> 00:39:05,760
I was thinking to myself, "I'm going to be so disappointed in myself

601
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,584
"if I didn't do a competitive time." Anyway, he has now hung himself.

602
00:39:11,624 --> 00:39:13,960
And obviously everybody here is very pleased to have a Brit

603
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,972
back on the top of the leaderboard.- AUDIENCE: Yes.

604
00:39:17,012 --> 00:39:21,972
When I say everybody, there is one man who is not pleased. The Stig.

605
00:39:22,012 --> 00:39:24,456
He knew about this time months ago when you did the lap.

606
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:26,364
This week he left the country.

607
00:39:26,404 --> 00:39:31,584
He went to North Korea to do an experiment. We don't know what.

608
00:39:31,624 --> 00:39:34,504
So apart from him everyone is thrilled.

609
00:39:34,544 --> 00:39:37,364
Ladies and gentlemen, the fastest man we've ever had - Lewis Hamilton.

610
00:39:37,404 --> 00:39:40,536
CHEERING

611
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:43,084
Well done, mate. That was worth coming back for.

612
00:39:43,124 --> 00:39:51,488
Without a doubt.

613
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:53,272
Now, a couple of weeks back

614
00:39:53,312 --> 00:39:56,196
we finished our American road trip at the Mexican border.

615
00:39:56,236 --> 00:39:59,444
The last one there had to cross over- and test something called

616
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:03,208
the Mastretta, which is a new sports car being made there.

617
00:40:03,248 --> 00:40:06,456
Now, Top Gear is not very popular in Mexico

618
00:40:06,496 --> 00:40:08,896
because of some comments that were made on the show.

619
00:40:08,936 --> 00:40:10,768
And, unfortunately,

620
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,144
the man who lost that race,

621
00:40:13,184 --> 00:40:15,096
and would therefore have to go into Mexico

622
00:40:15,136 --> 00:40:20,800
and test the Mastretta was the man who made those comments -

623
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,020
our Director of International Relations,

624
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:33,020
Boutros Boutros Hammond.

625
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:38,380
DOG BARKS

626
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:42,988
OK, so, here we are in Mexico but it's all right,

627
00:40:43,028 --> 00:40:48,080
I have everything under control.

628
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,080
You see?

629
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,724
An angry Mexican looks in, they'll see Jeremy,

630
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:56,328
and they hate Jeremy just as much as they hate me.

631
00:40:56,368 --> 00:40:58,116
Look at me!

632
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:03,208
Power! Oh, everything's rubbish.

633
00:41:03,248 --> 00:41:05,328
Except, no, cos I am now Jeremy,

634
00:41:05,368 --> 00:41:08,080
so they'll still cut my head off and then...

635
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,644
I haven't thought this through at all, have I?

636
00:41:10,684 --> 00:41:15,176
I'm not going to bother with that.

637
00:41:15,216 --> 00:41:17,240
OK, let's get this test over with

638
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,960
as quickly as possible and get out of here.

639
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,864
'Eventually, I found a place where no-one could see me

640
00:41:25,904 --> 00:41:32,488
'and I could get on with some serious road testing.'

641
00:41:32,528 --> 00:41:34,268
So, what have we got here?

642
00:41:34,308 --> 00:41:37,424
Well, its full name is the Mastretta MXT

643
00:41:37,464 --> 00:41:43,532
and this is the first fully home-grown Mexican car.

644
00:41:43,572 --> 00:41:46,440
'Now, when most countries make their first car,

645
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,440
'it's something cheap and practical for the masses.

646
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,768
'But what the Mexicans have done is skip the intro

647
00:41:53,808 --> 00:41:57,252
'and gone straight for a sports car.'

648
00:41:57,292 --> 00:42:04,208
Any similarities between this and an-early Lotus Elise are not accidental.

649
00:42:04,248 --> 00:42:07,580
It's small, it's compact, leather bucket seats,

650
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,408
suede-ish trim here and there.

651
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:20,160
Steering wheel no bigger thana tortilla, which is a good thing.

652
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:25,248
'The interior, the chassisand the body are all Mexican made.

653
00:42:25,288 --> 00:42:32,016
'But the 2.0 litre turbo engineis actually from over the border.'

654
00:42:32,056 --> 00:42:34,644
It's a Ford and it makes 250bhp,

655
00:42:34,684 --> 00:42:40,600
enough to take the Mastretta to 60 in 4.9 seconds.

656
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:48,908
Which could be useful if, say, somebody was trying to chase you.

657
00:42:48,948 --> 00:42:51,188
'Unlike some lightweight sports cars,

658
00:42:51,228 --> 00:42:56,172
'the Mastretta offers luxuries such as air-con and a stereo.'

659
00:42:56,212 --> 00:42:57,848
Put the radio on.

660
00:42:57,888 --> 00:43:06,984
MEXICAN SONG PLAYSOh, yeah, my favourite. I love this.

661
00:43:07,024 --> 00:43:11,736
'Despite the equipment, the MXT is no fatty -

662
00:43:11,776 --> 00:43:14,608
'weighing in at just 1,050 kilograms

663
00:43:14,648 --> 00:43:20,360
'thanks to a chassis made of carbon fibre and aluminium.'

664
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,144
You can see how they've tried to keep

665
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:23,968
all the car's weight between the wheels,

666
00:43:24,008 --> 00:43:25,584
which is why there is absolutely no

667
00:43:25,585 --> 00:43:27,160
overhang at the back or the front,

668
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,564
which is all well and good, still not sure about the styling, though.

669
00:43:31,604 --> 00:43:34,032
It looks like an Audi TT that has been squashed in a vice

670
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:37,484
and that's a good thing. Very good. Morning!

671
00:43:37,524 --> 00:43:39,280
Buenos dias.

672
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,596
The kind of thing Ferrari could learn a lot from. I shouldn't sit on it,

673
00:43:42,636 --> 00:43:44,520
I don't want to scratch it. Look at that - sleek.

674
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,092
Yeah!

675
00:43:48,132 --> 00:43:50,936
'The really good thing about the Mastretta

676
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:54,172
'is that it pretty much does what it says on the tin.'

677
00:43:54,212 --> 00:43:56,640
For a simple, uncomplicated, little, track-day car,

678
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,956
you want it to feel like a go-kart.

679
00:43:58,996 --> 00:44:02,048
This kind of does.

680
00:44:02,088 --> 00:44:05,128
It does grip.

681
00:44:05,168 --> 00:44:10,596
I was waiting for understeer then, there wasn't any.

682
00:44:10,636 --> 00:44:13,360
The gear linkage, always difficult when the engine is behind you,

683
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,264
works very well.

684
00:44:16,304 --> 00:44:19,956
'But it's not without faults.'

685
00:44:19,996 --> 00:44:22,236
The bonnet rattles about a bit.

686
00:44:22,276 --> 00:44:23,904
The windscreen wipers occasionally set off

687
00:44:23,944 --> 00:44:26,188
for a wanderall on their own without being asked.

688
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:30,160
The seals around the windows are terrible, hence the noise.

689
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,080
And it makes a hell of a noise over the bumps,

690
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,780
of which there are a few in Mexico.

691
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:41,372
'At ï¿½37,000, it's also nearlyten grand more than a Lotus Elise.

693
00:44:52,448 --> 00:44:59,496

696
00:45:06,164 --> 00:45:09,032
The thing is, we have kind of been here before in a way.

697
00:45:09,072 --> 00:45:10,904
James and Jeremy, when they went to China,

698
00:45:10,944 --> 00:45:11,012
were road testing their first attempt at a car

699
00:45:11,052 --> 00:45:15,688
and it wasn't brilliant.

700
00:45:15,728 --> 00:45:18,808
First attempts never are but, and who knows, with more time

701
00:45:18,848 --> 00:45:23,264
and more practice, one day the name Mastretta

702
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:33,264
might really stand for something.

703
00:45:34,884 --> 00:45:40,652
I think, on the whole, that went pretty well.

704
00:45:40,692 --> 00:45:43,828
That car's been behind me for a while now. He's following, isn't he?

705
00:45:43,868 --> 00:45:46,672
That is... He's... He's following me.

706
00:45:46,712 --> 00:45:48,136
Yeah.

708
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,748

What? Were you just being nice so you weren't beheaded?

710
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:04,404
No, no, like I said, it isgenuinely quite a good little car.

711
00:46:04,444 --> 00:46:08,028
Once they sort out some quality issues it shows real promise.

712
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:10,560
Well, listen, the hatchet is now buried, OK?

713
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,044
I think, thanks to Ban Ki-Hammond, we can now move on

714
00:46:13,084 --> 00:46:15,404
because, tonight,

715
00:46:15,444 --> 00:46:23,028
we are subjecting the new Kia Cee'd to many, many thorough tests.

716
00:46:23,068 --> 00:46:27,292
And coming up now is the most thorough test of them all.

726

Which is? On behalf of the viewers, I suspect,

727
00:47:20,456 --> 00:47:22,404
don't you have to pass it backwards?

728
00:47:22,444 --> 00:47:26,184
In real rugby, yes. That's not possible. So, we're not doing that?

Are we allowed to do this? What, here? Yes. Yes!

00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,144
It's half-time, we're losing, you're a bit crap.

845
00:54:33,184 --> 00:54:35,736
Now, when we're on the attack we're getting very messy.

846
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:38,680
Go up the pitch together in formation,

847
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,708
so we can pass straight up but be ready to come back down again.

848
00:54:42,748 --> 00:54:45,176
Very important, reversing if necessary.

849
00:54:45,216 --> 00:54:46,832
If not, you can get to the other end

850
00:54:46,872 --> 00:54:49,240
and you can quite easily do a handbrake turn around the post.

851
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,988
Either side, handbrake turn around the post,

852
00:54:52,028 --> 00:55:01,568
up you go again to the top and kill- Clarkson. That's all you have to do.

853
00:55:01,608 --> 00:55:04,456
Any questions?

854
00:55:04,496 --> 00:55:06,988
'We knew, as the second half began,- we had it all to do.'

855
00:55:07,028 --> 00:55:14,048
Right, my blokes need to get in there and batter them.

856
00:55:14,088 --> 00:55:21,504
'The lads did just that.'

858
00:55:23,088 --> 00:55:26,096
'And soon I got a break.'

859
00:55:26,136 --> 00:55:29,644
It's a run!

860
00:55:29,684 --> 00:55:33,360
I'm coming in from the back!

861
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:37,408
I know that's Clarkson trying to tackle me.

862
00:55:37,448 --> 00:55:40,564
Yes!

863
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:42,532
That's a try!

Oh, my God!

00:55:49,932 --> 00:55:53,192
'Naturally, I elected to take the conversion.'

Oh, he's done it!

870
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,848
Give me that!

871
00:56:01,888 --> 00:56:03,296
Damn it!

'May's comeback wasn't the only problem.'

874
00:56:11,152 --> 00:56:12,704
Oh dear, this hallowed turf is starting to get

875
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:19,112
a bit messed up, if I'm honest.

876
00:56:19,152 --> 00:56:29,112
'And things really weren't helped by the scrums.'

877
00:56:33,088 --> 00:56:36,284
Oh no, it's... I'm stuck. I've dug a big hole. I can't get...

JEREMY LAUGHS

879
00:56:40,492 --> 00:56:45,144
But on the upside, everything was lovely inside the Kias.

880
00:56:45,184 --> 00:56:47,832
You see, normally when people play rugby they get hot

881
00:56:47,872 --> 00:56:52,392
and they get sweaty but we're not having any of that here.

882
00:56:52,432 --> 00:56:57,984
Got the air conditioning set just so. I'm not hot, I'm sitting down.

883
00:56:58,024 --> 00:57:03,608
'Whilst I was distracted by the Kia, Team May broke through again.'

884
00:57:03,648 --> 00:57:05,736
We're on the run.

885
00:57:05,776 --> 00:57:07,956
Stop him, somebody!

886
00:57:07,996 --> 00:57:10,344
This is what we want!

887
00:57:10,384 --> 00:57:13,528
Here we go.

888
00:57:13,568 --> 00:57:15,316

Yes!

893
00:57:27,808 --> 00:57:29,828
'Putting his team ahead.'

894
00:57:29,868 --> 00:57:33,484
They are destroying us in this phase of play.

895
00:57:33,524 --> 00:57:35,264
'With just two points in it

I must say, viewers,

903
00:58:05,588 --> 00:58:08,296
at this point I have no idea what Jeremy has said in this test.

904
00:58:08,336 --> 00:58:15,236
I can confirm, though, that the Cee'd crashes quite well.

905
00:58:15,276 --> 00:58:17,344
Coming in for a try...

906
00:58:17,384 --> 00:58:18,640
Boof!

907
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,424
Ooh, crikey, Moses!

908
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:26,296
These things are built like brick lavatories.

'Football, that we used to play, car football...'

912
00:58:34,996 --> 00:58:37,012
Ooh, chit!

'..is well-suited to a...'

914
00:58:40,412 --> 00:58:41,516
CRUNCH!

915
00:58:41,556 --> 00:58:44,392
Sorry. That was a total mistake. My fault.

916
00:58:44,432 --> 00:58:46,080
That's not cricket.

917
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,236
It's actually not that bad. It'll buff out.

918
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,012
'Despite some injuries,

919
00:58:51,052 --> 00:58:58,328

Oh, he's on a run!

Oh, come on, men!

922
00:59:04,304 --> 00:59:07,652
Pass it. Don't try and get through. Pass.

923
00:59:07,692 --> 00:59:08,888
No!

924
00:59:08,928 --> 00:59:12,608
It's us! It's us! Go, go, go!

925
00:59:12,648 --> 00:59:16,216
Yes! Yes! Yes!

926
00:59:16,256 --> 00:59:19,544
Looking good!

Read it and weep!

932
00:59:47,536 --> 00:59:49,448
I think we've learned two things tonight.

933
00:59:49,488 --> 00:59:52,232
Number one, if you want to play rugby in a car,

934
00:59:52,272 --> 00:59:54,448
the Cee'd is brilliant.

935
00:59:54,488 --> 00:59:56,388
It's fast, it's agile and it's tough.

936
00:59:56,428 --> 00:59:58,952
But, perhaps more importantly,

937
00:59:58,992 --> 01:00:03,168
we've learned that grass is not a good surface.

938
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:05,608
I mean, we've only played one match here and look,

939
01:00:05,648 --> 01:00:11,328
the pitch is completely ruined - absolutely ruined.

940
01:00:11,368 --> 01:00:17,416
They're going to have to pave this over, really.

942
01:00:21,428 --> 01:00:24,684

INDISTINCT CHATTER

01:00:27,176 --> 01:00:28,776
Chaps?! What?

946
01:00:28,816 --> 01:00:31,416
Do you know why they call it hallowed turf?

947
01:00:31,456 --> 01:00:33,120
Erm...

948
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:37,728
Because it is hallowed. Do you know what hallowed means?

949
01:00:37,768 --> 01:00:38,888
Temporary.

950
01:00:38,928 --> 01:00:40,156
LAUGHTER

951
01:00:40,196 --> 01:00:44,028
Yes, yes, James. "Our Father who art-in heaven, temporary be thy name."

952
01:00:44,068 --> 01:00:48,776
Oh, yeah. I do think we owe everyone a apology. Yes, you do.

953
01:00:48,816 --> 01:00:53,496
Because we've just shown strong pornography before the watershed.

954
01:00:53,536 --> 01:00:55,280
Sorry, what? All that handbrake action.

955
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,056
Oh, yes.

956
01:00:58,096 --> 01:01:02,340
Every single girl watching tonight will be cross-eyed.

957
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,716
Good point. They don't see two fat middle-aged men any more.

958
01:01:03,756 --> 01:01:07,056
What they see are Bradley Cooper and Ryan Reynolds.

959
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:09,964
I'm not sure the handbrake lever is that effective. Yes, it is.

960
01:01:10,004 --> 01:01:12,840
And on that bombshell, it is time to end.

961
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,200
Thank you so much for watching. Good night!
