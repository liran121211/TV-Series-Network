1
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,240
Tonight, I point at a thing...


2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,520
..Richard walks through a shop


3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,840
and James has some bananas.


4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,080
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING


5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,640
Hello! Hello, everybody.
Thank you.


6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,920
Thank you so much.


7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,120
Now, every so often we like to
remind ourselves that this is


8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,640
a motoring show.


9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,960
So, we get three really nice cars
and go for a long drive.


10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,000
And what we do is, we take it in
turns to choose the location.


11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,280
So, if it's my turn,
we usually end up in France,


12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,280
if it is James's turn
we usually end up in...


13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,600
1953.
LAUGHTER


14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,920
Tonight, though,
it was Hammond's turn.


15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,360
So guess what?


16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,920
Our meeting point was
the Valley of Fire in Nevada.


17
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,920
And what you see here
is the car I'll be using.


18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,320
This is a Lexus LFA.


19
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,480
It's not the most powerful car
in the world, it's not the fastest,


20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,280
it's not the best looking
and it certainly isn't the cheapest.


21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,640
Plus, the Lexus badge does come
with a whiff of masonry.


22
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,600
But I drove one of these
in England last year


23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,040
and I emerged from the experience
thinking, "That might very well be


24
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,080
"the best car I've ever driven."


25
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,600
And that's why we're here.


26
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,320
To find out.
FAR-OFF ENGINE ROARS


27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,960
At this point,
the stillness of the desert


28
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,360
was shattered by the sound
of an approaching James May,


29
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,360
who was at the wheel of the new
Aston Martin Vanquish.


30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,080
That's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.


31
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,200
It's not bad, is it?


32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,040
This is a DBS replacement,


33
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,800
but also a bit inspired by
the 177, million pound thing.


34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,560
And look at the upholstery!


35
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,600
I know, the upholstery
is outrageous.


36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,480
That's the best looking Aston
there's ever been, actually.


37
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,640
Best one they've done.


38
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,360
That, though, cos I've never seen
one in a good colour like that,


39
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,000
that is pretty fantastic.
No, but yours is better.


40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,520
And the great thing is,
I'm in the better car


41
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,800
and I'm just going to follow you
around going, "That is beautiful."


42
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,480
'After a bit more
mutual mastication,


43
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,600
'we started to wonder what
Billy Bob Hammond might bring.'


44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,920
Will it be something subtle,
small, European?


45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,680
No, my money was on something
rather large,


46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,320
brash and maybe even American.


47
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,040
FAR-OFF ENGINE ROARS


48
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,720
'And blow me down, I was right.'


49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,560
So... The new Viper.


50
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,840
You? Yeah.


51
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,760
I know it looks exactly like the old
one, but that is the new Viper.


52
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,800
ENGINE PURRS
Yay. Subtle.


53
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,440
Before you two start, let me just
tell you, that 8.4 litre V10,


54
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,080
that's the largest engine
ever fitted to any production car


55
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,400
since the war.
And looking around here,


56
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,400
let's not forget,
this car is the fastest,


57
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,120
with the highest top speed,
it's the fastest to 60,


58
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,080
the most powerful, 640bhp,


59
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,120
it's got the most torque
and the biggest engine.


60
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,720
I'm sorry, Hammond.
They haven't styled it.


61
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,480
This has been in a wind tunnel
to look like this!


62
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,360
If that's been in a wind tunnel,


63
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,080
they parked it in there sideways
for all the good it's done.


64
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,520
It's been in a wind tunnel.
Look at the panel gap.


65
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,240
I'll stand behind you,
have a look at it.


66
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,480
Let me see if I can see
how many fingers you hold up
in that panel gap.


67
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,840
There has to be a gap
between the panels or


68
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,160
there'd be one piece!
Let's have a look at yours.


69
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,840
That looks ridiculous. It's a Lexus.
It's just a nerd-fest. It's a Lexus.


70
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,800
It's for rich golfers, is what it is.
I admit, the Lexus...


71
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,840
If you want to talk about panel gap,
there's a whopper straightaway.


72
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,080
It's a cooling system!
Is it heck, it doesn't fit.


73
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,320
I'm surprised at you cos this is
a bunch of retro nonsense, really.


74
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,000
CLARKSON SPLUTTERS
No, I'm sorry, I won't have that.


75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's very pretty, yes,
but it's harking...


76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,520
It's harking back to the past


77
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,160
and a car with an engine
from the 1930s isn't?


78
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,920
This is a nerd-fest, that's for
old fools, that is a proper,


79
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,120
honest Gran T... 8.4 litre V10.
You don't need it to be that big!


80
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,680
Hang on a second. Who owns Chrysler
now, the people that made this?


81
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,960
Fiat. What else do they make?


82
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,480
Ferrari. There you go.


83
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,000
But, Hammond, All-Bran is made by
the same people who make Frosties.


84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,440
It doesn't mean they're comparable!
That's a stupid...


85
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,160
It's not! Right, look.


86
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,120
I knew I would get some flak...
Shush. Shush.


87
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,640
Instead of just standing here
arguing... Yes.


88
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,440
..why don't we go for a drive?


89
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,760
That's a better idea. Open the taps.


90
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,600
'Straight away, though,
there was a problem.'


91
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,040
Not again. Hammond, why do
you like it in America so much?


92
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Every nice piece of road
has an 8mph speed limit on it.


93
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,800
I don't know, don't ask me,
it's not my fault.


94
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes, it is.


95
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,520
I mean, what are we going to hit?


96
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,360
What are we going to hit here?
There's nothing.


97
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,320
No wildlife, no people.


98
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,680
This is stupid. It's stupid!


99
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,840
'Eventually, though,
the 35mph hour limit ended,


100
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,320
'and thanks to some trickery
in the edit,


101
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,080
'we were able to take our cars up
to a dizzying 55mph.'


102
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,720
There it goes.


103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
This isn't just an engine,
it's a force of nature!


104
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,600
Let's see what a proper V12
feels like.


105
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,120
Nice is the answer.


106
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,440
The engine in this is so exquisite


107
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,320
that it revs from idle to 9,000rpm
in 0.6 of a second.


108
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,280
In fact, it revs so fast


109
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,160
they couldn't fit a conventional
rev counter.


110
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,840
It had to be electronic, because
a normal one simply can't keep up.


111
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,760
Right, let's sort something out
right from the start.


112
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,600
James's Aston Martin costs £190,000.


113
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,160
Jeremy's Celica, £340,000.


114
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,200
This - £75,000 or thereabouts.


115
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,800
That is a huge difference!


116
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,000
It does all the fancy stuff, too,
it's got all the fancy materials,


117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,360
carbon fibre, aluminium, magnesium -
they're all in here.


118
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
'But when it comes to technology,


119
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,000
'neither of their cars is a match
for the howling LFA.'


120
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:17,440
It took five years of sweat,
toil and cash to design this car


121
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,920
and then just before they put
it on sale, someone said,


122
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,680
"You know, I think it would be
better if the body was made from


123
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,000
"carbon fibre rather
than aluminium."


124
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,880
And they began all over again.


125
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,720
How much would that cost?!


126
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,320
All I do know is,
they sell them for £340,000


127
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,320
and they lose money on every single
one that leaves the dealership.


128
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,680
'By the time Jeremy had stopped
droning on about his Celica,


129
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,280
'we were on a motorway


130
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,960
'and I got the distinct impression
I was playing gooseberry.'


131
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,200
I'd like to say that, from the back,
particularly in that colour,


132
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,160
and in fact this light,
the LFA looks absolutely epic.


133
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,640
I mean, seriously.

Ooh, that makes a lovely sound.


136
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,560
It makes a very nice noise,
your Aston Martin.


137
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,120
Oh, God, why don't you two
just get a room?


138
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,560
"Your car looks nice!"
"Oh, your car sounds lovely." Ooh!


139
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,720
'But they didn't get a room.


140
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,600
'Instead, they stopped
to look at a silly aeroplane.'


141
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,240
James? Yeah, yeah. B-2? Yeah.


142
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,960
That's amazing, isn't it?


143
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,720
That is a B-2 stealth bomber
coming into land at...


144
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,160
Actually, he's turning
to come over us. Yeah.


145
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,760
We're not supposed
to be able to see it, are we?


146
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,520
THEY LAUGH
I don't think it works!

'a lot of very noisy modified cars,

158
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,720
Look, there's another one come in
dressed as a policeman.


159
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,120
No, they really are police. What,
genuinely? They really... I promise.


160
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,880
There they are, police sheriff
and the fire department.


161
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,360
They invite kids down
to race against them


162
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,800
to stop the kids racing
on the streets.


163
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,240
So they race the actual police?
That was a police Mustang.


164
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,640
They've modded, the police have
modded it and then say to kids...


165

"What you got?" "Can you beat us?"
They actually call it Beat The Meat.


166
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,600
No, it's probably Beat The Heat,
cos heat means... Yeah, I meant that.


167
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,880
'To prove that modified
cars are idiotic,


168
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,400
'Jeremy decided to take on
the local sheriff.'


169
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,560
Yes, look, I'm up against
some crummy pickup truck.


170
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,280
This is going to just be...


171
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,800
..well, deeply embarrassing for him.


172
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,600
That's there?!


173
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,120
'After this humiliation,


174
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,080
'I took on the state trooper

175
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,400
OK, now, come on, Richard,
concentrate.


176
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,480
Where's he gone?


177
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,080
'Having watched the fire
department's motorcycle demolish
a Honda NSX...'

'..James wisely decided to take on

Oh, yes, for England!


181
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,200
I'm going to do it in D and Sport,
I'm going to use Launch Control.


182
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,880
Try not to look smug, James. Try not
to look smug. Practise your face.


183
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,040
ENGINES PURR


184
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,880
TYRES SCREECH


185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,520
Oh, hang on a second.


186
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,200
All-wheel drive beats
rear-wheel drive.

'Having spent the entire evening

Pick on a weak one!


192
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,760
Oh, no!

'..we decided we didn't like
drag racing

'and went into Las Vegas

195
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,400
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING


196
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,960
Humiliating.


197
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,600
I can't believe, I still can't
believe that I was beaten


198
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,280
by some bloke who had spent
1,500 quid modifying
an ancient Mitsubishi.


199
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,200
No, but the reason we hate modified
cars is cos we know,


200
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,800
if he tried to do it again,
his engine would go "BANG!


201
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,640
"Clatter, clatter, clatter," and
that would be end of that. True.


202
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,440
I'll tell you what I think's funny,


203
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,920
imagine the British police
trying to do Beat the Meat.


204
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,600
Heat! Heat!
LAUGHTER


205
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,360
"Right, I've tuned up
the Astra Diesel.


206
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,360
"I might get 120 out of it
down the straight now,


207
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,880
"who wants to take me on?"
What a spectacle.


208
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,280
But anyway, the most important thing
is to reveal now which of the cars,


209
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,320
our cars, was the fastest
and it was mine.


210
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,120
Er, yours was the most expensive.


211
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,040
It was the fastest.


212
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,600
Listen, on paper
the Viper is the fastest.


213
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,440
Yes, on paper,
but, Hammond, on tarmac...


214
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,240
LAUGHTER


215
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,840
..mine was the... It was,
it just was. User area...


216
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,160
Anyway, we'll pick that up later on
but now we're going to do the news.


217
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,840
Yes, we are. I've had
another theory. Good.


218
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Oh, God. No, you love my theories.


219
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,760
OK, this one, you know Jessops
and HMV and Woolworths and Comet,


220
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,800
they all closed down recently?
Yeah, Jeremy, this is a car show.


221
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,760
Yes, yes, bear with me, OK?


222
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,320
And everyone is asking,


223
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,040
"Why are people shopping in retail
and out-of-town centres


224
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,640
"and town centres are just
becoming boarded-up shops


225
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,400
"and women in short skirts vomiting
and catching herpes?" Right?


226
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,920
LAUGHTER
There's a very good reason for this.


227
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,640
It's cos when you go to an
out-of-town retail centre place,


228
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,120
you can park your car.


229
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,800
When you go into a town centre,
you can't.


230
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,880
Right, so what are you suggesting?


231
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,480
It's easy to fix Britain's
town centres.


232
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,320
Rip up every double yellow line and
sack every single traffic warden.


233
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,520
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE


234
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,000
The problem is solved.
Why wouldn't you do that?


235
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,760
Everybody's running around going,


236
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,680
"Town centres are dying,
what should we do? It's easy!"


237
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,640
But if you allow people to park
anywhere in the town centre,


238
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,440
it'll become impossible to get in
or out. Rubbish! It's true.


239
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,200
So you think parking restrictions
are just out of spite?


240
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,960
Well, what else are they for?


241
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,480
They go, "Hey, we did really well,
we got a £12 revenue today


242
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,080
"from our parking restrictions."
Meanwhile, every shop is shut.


243
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,560
We need to have a more French
attitude to parking.


244
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,120
Cos the rule in France is,


245
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,240
if there is a space that a car will
go in, you put your car in it.


246
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,960
Even if it's on a mini roundabout,
that is the rule.


247
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,240
James, why aren't we
running the country?


248
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,800
Why are we presenting this programme
with Noel Coward, more to the point?


249
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,080
You were Mr Toad last week,
you really are moving around.


250
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,120
Right, we've sorted parking. Good.
You haven't!


251
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,840
Now, the next problem we face
and this is a big one...


252
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,320
You know when James
is telling you something


253
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,760
and you start to feel drowsy?
Oh, God.


254
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,360
Yes, it's like you've had
a whole bottle of red,


255
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,960
five portions of shepherd's pie
in front of a fire.


256
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,480
Yeah, and it's embarrassing.
It is embarrassing.


257
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,320
He's in the middle of a story
and you nod off. It's awkward.


258
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,400
It is awkward. However, it's all
going to be solved with this. £8.99.


259
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,880
You clip it on your ear, OK?
BEEPING


260
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,840
Right. Sitting still.


261
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,880
James. Explain torque. Torque?


262
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,480
Torque is fantastically simple,
Jeremy, it's just a force
at a distance,


263
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,840
that's why it's in pound-feet,
for example, or newton metres.


264
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,520
EARPIECE BEEPS
LAUGHTER


265
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,040
It's waking me up as well,
what's the point of that?


266
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,880
I can hear him now. It is, I'd
rather be asleep with his lectures.


267
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,480
No, they also say it can be used
for drivers.


268
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,640
So when you're driving you can
have it on your ear


269
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,440
and if you nod off,
it'll wake you up.


270
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,920
But, and you'll love this bit,


271
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,600
it says in the blurb it could be
used by airline pilots. What?!


272
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,800
Oh, really? That's some comfort,
isn't it? It's reassuring, I think.


273
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,440
Mid Atlantic, thinking, "It's OK
because the fate of me


274
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,000
"and all these other souls
on board this jumbo jet


275
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,560
"lie in the hands of a £7.99..."
8.99!


276
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,280
"..£8.99 Chinese-made ear beep."


277
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,800
I don't actually know how much
a Boeing 747 costs,


278
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,720
but I'm pretty sure the price
isn't something 99.


279
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,760
But there's no component
of it that's something 99.


280
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,160
Can you imagine if they said,
"An announcement now
from the flight deck..."


281
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,040
BEEPING
Argh! Wake up!


282
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,480
Wake up! It is a stupid idea.


283
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,280
It is a stupid idea.


284
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,080
Now, while I was driving down here
I saw one of the new Jaguar F-types.


285
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,560
Have you heard about this?
The new Jag small sports car.


286
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,680
Got a picture here. It is a
beautiful looking thing. Oh, yes.


287
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,120
And actually, it's even better
looking from the back.


288
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,640
I mean, that is a sensational
looking thing.


289
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,760
But I'll tell you what surprised me
about it,


290
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,600
is I thought it was
going to cost 40,000,


291
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,520
the same as a Porsche Boxster
or a Mercedes SLK.


292
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,920
It's going to cost between 60 and
80,000, and even on the top models


293
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,960
you pay extra for heated seats
and keyless entry and so on.


294
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,880
I'll tell you what
worries me about that.


295
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,360
I bet they have set that up more
for handling and less for comfort.


296
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,160
Mm. Which will be a mistake.


297
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,880
God, it's for younger people.
That's the...


298
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,760
It isn't! It is. It isn't!


299
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,840
Younger people spend 150 quid
on their cars, not 80 grand.


300
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,440
The only person who can spend 80
grand on a car is in their 50s.


301
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,320
That car, Hammond, it is... Yeah,
well, us, but it is made for people,


302
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,960
exclusively for people, who make
a noise when they sit down. Eh?


303
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,560
You go to a Jag dealership to buy
that and they'll say,


304
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,880
"Mr May, take a seat."
And you go, "Oh, thank you.


305
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,600
"Ahhhh. Yes!"


306
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,120
Sold! Oh, God... That car is
for people who watch TV OR text.


307
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,640
Not both at the same time.


308
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,920
You do realise you two are
now officially the oldest


309
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,200
people in the world!


310
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,080
Hammond, we can't all be 36
forever, mate.


311
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,320
I like it, I'm sticking with it.
Now, news from Citroen.


312
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,560
They've developed a car
that runs on compressed air.


313
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,080
No, I've been reading about this


314
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,760
and I have literally
no idea how it works.


315
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,000
I saw you reading about this
earlier on today and you know


316
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,640
when somebody's eyes glaze?


317
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,360
His looked like they'd been
painted on.


318
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,800
It's undecipherable. And you could
see the words ricocheting off. Ping!


319
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,880
They wouldn't go in, I can't work
it out. I can't work it out.


320
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,960
It's simple. It's a bit like...
BEEPING


321
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,880
Explain it to me then, James.


322
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,800
LAUGHTER
It's like a hybrid, like a Toyota,


323
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,120
but instead of generating
electricity under-braking
when going downhill,


324
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,680
it compresses air, which then...


325
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,240
BEEPING
It wakes me as well!


326
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,320
How does...
No, this is what I don't understand.


327
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,280
Why don't they just put,
you know those scuba divers tanks


328
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,320
on the back and then they shoot air
out and it'll make it go along?


329
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,240
Because that wouldn't work.
It would!


330
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,000
What about fire extinguishers?


331
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,320
You put two fire extinguishers
on the boot lid,


332
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,840
when you set them off it would
make the car move forward.


333
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,280
Technically it would,
but it's extremely wasteful.


334
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,000
To go round our track,
you'd need a fire extinguisher
the size of Hazelmere.


335
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,040
No, no, no.


336
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,680
No, because fire extinguishers
are full of carbon dioxide. Yes.


337
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,200
Well, engines produce carbon dioxide


338
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,440
so you'd endlessly refill
the fire extinguisher.


339
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,840
You can't use carbon dioxide
from cars to power cars.


340
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,120
Isaac Newton said it would work.
I'm going to prove it.


341
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,440
I'm going to prove it.


342
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,080
What goes on...? Give me this...
Right. What goes on in his head?


343
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,720
Move back. Move back, move back.


344
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,960
Back!


345
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,120
LAUGHTER


346
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,960
Because seriously, I'm going
to rocket across the studio floor.


347
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,640
Are we ready, everybody?
CROWD MURMUR


348
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,240
Here we go.


349
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,200
LAUGHTER


350
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,720
Why's it doing this?


351
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,000
Why is it doing that?


352
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,880
Newton said the opposite
of any reaction... No.


353
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,360
Every action has an equal and
opposite reaction, yes. Rubbish!


354
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,840
Every action makes you spin
round in a lazy circle.


355
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,480
Clever or not, you can't expect him
to have foreseen a gigantic,


356
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,880
idiotic ape in an office chair
with a fire extinguisher, can you?


357
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,560
Shall we move on? Yes!


358
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,880
Because tonight we are involved
in an epic drive across the western
United States in a Lexus LFA,


359
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,120
an Aston Martin Vanquish
and the mighty Viper.


360
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,960
Yes, and when we left the action
earlier we were with


361
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,120
the Las Vegas Police Department,
taking part in some drag racing.


362
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,040
The idea being that if you race on
the track, you won't feel inclined


363
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,400
to race between the traffic lights
out on the streets.


364
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,640
So, had it worked?


365
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,240
Ahhhh!


366
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,000
You know we're supposed to have got
this out of our system, don't you?


367
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,200
We've been on the
awareness course.


368
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,440
'A long journey lay ahead.
So, we decided to annoy Jeremy.'


369
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,120
Just to let you know, my iPod's
working really well in the car,


370
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,800
how about yours?


371
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,520
No, I don't have an
iPod connector in here.


372
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,000
I suppose, yeah,


373
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,240
it'd be a bit much to ask for that
on a £340,000 car, wouldn't it(?)


374
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,440
I would imagine it would be there,
my simple hick car has got...


375
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,200
You can Bluetooth your iPhone to it.


376
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,160
Jeremy, is there anything else you
haven't got that any reasonable,


377
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,080
modern car should have?


378
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,640
Er, not really.


379
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,960
Don't say cup-holders.


380
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,000
Have you got a cup-holder?


381
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,800
No, I haven't got a cup-holder.


382
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,320
What a tragic oversight.


383
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,360
I think Lexus were concentrating


384
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,440
so hard on building the perfect car,
they forgot that occasionally


385
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,440
you might need to go somewhere
in it and need a cup-holder


386
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,360
and an iPod connector and a seat
belt that does up more easily


387
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,840
than this one, which doesn't do up
easily at all if you're a bit...


388
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,880
fat.


389
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,360
I've got a meter that tells me


390
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,200
how much torque my engine is
producing at any given moment.


391
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,600
Have you got one of those?


392
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,320
I absolutely haven't got one
of those and I'm very,
very pleased about it.


393
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,360
Oh, God, Hammond,


394
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,400
the back of your car lights up
with a stupid viper when you break.


395
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,080
Ahh!
CLARKSON LAUGHS


396
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,200
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever seen!


397
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,760
That isn't just a viper,
that is a Stryker,


398
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,560
it's the emblem of this car.


399
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,120
I'm going to crash into
you trying to get a closer look


400
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,640
at your novelty item.


401
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,040
'As we cruised at a steady 55
towards California,


402
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,560
'Jeremy discovered yet another
problem with the Lexus.'


403
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,200
Would you mind awfully if we stopped
for petrol? I need some.


404
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,240
I've got more than half a tank.


405
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,600
So have I.


406
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,560
It is quite a small tank.


407
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,680
'In a town famous for having the
tallest thermometer in the world,


408

409
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,200
'and then bought Hammond some fuel
for his car.'


410
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,640
Oh... May?


411
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,200
Yeah? This is the right fuel
for a Viper, isn't it?


412
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,040
Looks like it. Funny(!)


413
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,480
Well, we can't get it in the tank.
Funny(!)


414
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,200
You know what you've done?


415
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,120
You haven't got unleaded wood,
that's why it won't go in the slot.


416
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,320
Is it charcoal we need? Yeah.
I'm sorry, mate.


417
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,640
Never mind. Thank you. I'll go
and change it for some charcoal.


418
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,280
'While I did that,
Hammond kindly solved
the LFA's cup-holder problem.'


419
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,080
They haven't put sugar in it!


420
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,120
'After the pit stop,
the producers told us


421
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,200
'to report to a racetrack
called Willow Springs.'


422
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,520
Er, right. I'm going to try a sat
nav test. Here we go. Use my mouse.


423
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,880
You actually get a mouse in one
of these. Destination, click.


424
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,480
Apparently it's calling someone.


425
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,160
'Lexus Inform.' It is.


426
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,720
'This is Anita. Where would
you like to go today?'


427
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,160
Er, Willow Springs Raceway.


428
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,880
'Just a moment and
I can help you with that.'


429
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,920
No... 'Let me just get that
plugged in for you.'


430
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,280
And then can you make that come
onto my screen in the car?


431
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,200
'Absolutely, I'm going to download
it to your navigation for you


432
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,600
'instead of you putting it in
yourself.


433
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,960
'Is there anything else
I can help with?'


434
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,840
Er, no, I'm so staggered.
That's amazing, thank you very much.


435
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,480
'You're welcome.


436
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,880
'Definitely call us 24/7
as many times as you need


437
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,320
'and we will help you out, OK?'


438
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,440
'In fact, I called her back
immediately.


439
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,280
'And she suggested we stop off
at a nearby tourist attraction.'


440
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,000
What they've done here is,
you will note,


441
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,840
is fitted grooves at intervals
along the road. Right.


442
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,440
So, as you drive over them,
your tyres make a noise.


443
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,040
They play a note.


444
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,400
Really? This road is musical.


445
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,720
Is it? It's musical.


446
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,480
Really? It plays a tune
as you drive...


447
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,480
'As James has a music degree,
we sent him out to test it.'


448
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,800
Here we go.


449
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,840
VAGUELY MUSICAL NOTES RING OUT


450
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,320
Is that a tune?


451
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,400
I think that was supposed to be
the William Tell Overture.


452
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,440
Jeremy then had another idea.


453
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,480
Richard Hammond and I
will now perform a duet.


454
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,120
NOTES RING OUT


455
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,520
If I reverse, will it play
a message from the devil?


456
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,600
This often happens in rock and roll.


457
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,720
What a numpty.


458
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,560
To make the tune go backwards, you
can still drive the car forwards.


459
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,280
Yeah... Never mind.


460
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,560
Yes.


461
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,840
It's telling me
Paul McCartney's dead


462
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,120

any shoes or socks.

That's that one... It's like
paintballing but with lasers.


473
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,840
You have a jacket that's got
laser receptors on it


474

hit. Yes, I know that. What?

aerial laser quest."

00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,600
I missed.


493
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,200
Let's just try sheer speed for a bit.


494
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,920
Bit of braking might fox him there.


495
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,280
LASERS FIRE
Oh, no!


496
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,720
Oh, Captain Slow.


497
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,000
You're going to need to do better
than that, my friend.


498
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,120
Big speed coming up, 140!


499
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,480
That's nothing to those planes,
they could just reel me.


500
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,640
OK.


501
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,920
OK. We're going to go
for the Lexus.


502
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,720
Trying to shoot this car
from a plane like that, I'm sorry,


503
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,520
it's like trying to swat a fly
with a drinking straw.


504
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,760
Not going to happen.


505
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,320
LASERS FIRE


506
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,920
Oh, no!


507
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,600
Bingo! Lex is dead.


508
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,480
LASERS FIRE
I'm hit again!


509
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,520
They're just shooting at me
because my car's Japanese!


510
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,880
LASERS FIRE


511
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,760
It's racism. Sorry, Jeremy.


512
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,200
'There was only one thing for it.'


513
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,640
'Lexus Inform, this is Cheryl,
where would you like to go today?'


514
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,880
I'm being attacked by
fighter planes!


515
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,040
'I'm sorry, can you repeat that?'
Yes, I'm being attacked.


516
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,080
There are fighter planes and
I'm trying to get away from them.


517
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,600
Do you have any suggestions?


518
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,200
'She didn't. And as a result,
the game became a turkey shoot.'


519
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,960
LASERS FIRE RAPIDLY


520
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,760
What?!


521
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,200
No!


522
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,720
Argh!


523
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,760
Lexus dead.
Hamster is dead.


524
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,360
Bingo, Viper's dead.


525
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,840
Oh, there's Viper.


526
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,560
No, no, no, another hit for me!


527
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,000
My God, they got Ginger.

529
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,720
Smoke!


530
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,240
Smoke!


531
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,120
Oh, they're going in for the kill,
I can see him zooming down.


532
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,560
TENDER ORCHESTRAL MUSIC


533
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,280
'To be honest, we weren't enjoying
the relentless slaughter.'


534
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,840
TENDER MUSIC ENDS


535
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,520
Under attack, under attack.


536
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,000
'But we were at least loving
our cars.'


537
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,160
Oh!


538
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,720
The guts of this car are what make it
unbelievable on track.


539
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,120
Just hauls ass.


540
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,120
LASERS FIRE


541
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,840
Jinking, jinking.


542
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,080
And brake!


543
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,080
Oh, that just feels tremendous.


544
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,560
LASER FIRE CONTINUES


545
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:50,240
The word immediate was invented for
the throttle response on this car.


546
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,800
And the steering. And the gearbox.
And every single thing about it.


547
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,640
Ha-ha! Look at that.


548
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,800
'But though our cars were good,
the planes were better.'

00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,200
LASERS FIRE
Oh, my God, how did he get me there?


550
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,240
'So, 26 laps into the 5-lap event,
we decided to get cunning.'


551
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,080
You see? Ha-ha, where am I now then,
plane? You can't see me.


552
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,200
HE LAUGHS
LASERS FIRE


553
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,400
Invisi... Oh, he's got me. Bugger!


554
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,520
What I've done is, I've hidden
near the hills, behind a bucket.


555
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,840
See, this is the ingenuity
that marks me aside.


556
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,120
LASERS FIRE


557
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,360
Oh, what?!


558
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,840
TYRES SCREECH


559
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,160
Cunning wasn't working,
so we did what we do best - panic.


560
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,840
Hammond, you're going the wrong way.
You're going the wrong way!


561
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,480
Who's going the wrong way?


562
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,080
Oh, I'm going the wrong way!


563
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,520
LASERS FIRE
Agh! No!


564
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,120
What?!


565
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,240
Ah, a bonus.


566
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,320
LASERS FIRE
No!


567
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,320
'Fading light eventually brought
the massacre to an end.'


568
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,160
There's a lot of bullet holes
on those cars down there.


569
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,400
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING


570
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,400
I liked that day.
That was a lot of fun.


571
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,600
I really did.


572
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,080
Can I just say, have you ever,
in your entire lives,


573
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,880
seen aircraft flying lower or faster
than that? No. To be honest, no.


574
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,600
I haven't. It's amazing. They
were just six feet off the deck.


575
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,960
Can I just bring us towards
the meat of the thing here?


576
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,920
Which is, I can now reveal,
I was hit 23 times.


577
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,920
A-ha! 17 times.


578
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,000
LAUGHTER


579
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,080
Come on then. What?
How many times where you hit?


580
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,160
I can't remember.
Yes, you can. Come on.


581
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,600
CLARKSON MURMURS EVASIVELY


582
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,120
How many? 48.


583
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,680
48?! So you lost...
LAUGHTER


584
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,320
It was racism. Really? Racism?


585
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,320
Either way, you lost. The pilots
told me as well that, James,


586
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,080
you only won because every time
they went into a strafing dive


587
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,960
to hit us, they had to anticipate
where the car would be.


588
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,880
And every time your car was
considerably further back


589
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,440
than they'd expected it to be.


590
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,000
True. They said they couldn't hit
you because you were driving
too slowly. Really? They did.


591
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,560
Well, as I've said many times
before, gentlemen,


592
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,800
he who is last shall be first,
and so it turns out.


593
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,520
So the Baby Jesus had a point?


594
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,880
Anyway, it is now time to put
a star in our reasonably priced car.


595
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,120
My guest tonight is a member
of a popular ensemble where all


596
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,560
the members find each other
very irritating.


597
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,480
Oh, imagine that(!) Quite.


598
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,480
Ladies and gentlemen, from Fleetwood
Mac, it is the man himself,


599
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,720
Mick Fleetwood.


600
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,560
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING


601
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,440
Holy moly!


602
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,960
You're here! How are you?
Mick Fleetwood has come to Top Gear.


603
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,280
RAUCOUS CHEERING


604
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,480
We sit? Yes, have a seat, please.


605
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,000
Lord have mercy.
I've gone nervous. Oh, my God.


606
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,680
Only Roger Daltrey sat
on that side of the sofa.


607
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,440
It's obviously a rock thing.
No, that's lovely too. You choose.


608
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,120
Or I can be just big.


609
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,560
It's nice to have someone who is
the right height. There you go.


610
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,400
We'll get on to your amazing
car history in a minute


611
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,480
but if I may, I want
to talk about Rumours


612
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,120
cos this is one of my absolute
all-time favourite albums.


613
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,040
How many have been sold over
the years? Billions. No...


614
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,440
LAUGHTER


615
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,160
A lot. Getting on for 50 million
copies or so, yeah.


616
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,560
50 million copies?! I think, for me,


617
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,920
the most amazing thing about Rumours
is that it got made at all.


618
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,560
Because I think I'm right
in saying, I mean,


619
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,200
people think of The Who
and Keith Moon in particular


620
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,920
and Led Zeppelin and what have you,
there was some excess there.


621
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,880
But when it came to excess,
Fleetwood Mac were really,


622
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,960
as far as I can work out,
in a class of their own.


623
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,720
Don't get me wrong,
we were definitely in the top ten,


624
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,560
I would say, if not more.


625
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,520
But I think the romance of that


626
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,040
and the drama of that
became out of control,


627
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,280
mainly because we were stupid enough,


628
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,000
and somewhat irresponsible, to be
too open about our dirty laundry.


629
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,760
You were talking in public.


630
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,400
But it wasn't just the drugs either.
It was, as far as I can work out,


631
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,120
the band was just made up of people
who were fighting at that time. Yes.


632
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,840
We've got a photograph here
of the band.


633
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,880
So there's you, in the middle, OK,
the drummer.


634
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,120
And then we've got an American
couple who really didn't get on,


635
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,200
they were falling out
during the recording.


636
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,960
And a British couple. Yes. Who were
going through the same problems.


637
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,480
Now, the songs that they were
writing about each other


638
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,200
were genuinely about each other.


639
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,600
So, Stevie wrote Dreams, which was
about her boyfriend Lindsey. Yeah.


640
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,080
And then he wrote You Can
Go Your Own Way. Yes.


641
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,720
I know where you're going with this.
I think it's phenomenal.


642
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,840
The worst one was, was it Christine
wrote the song of John, her husband?


643
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,040
Er, yes. She did You Make Loving
Fun and he must have thought,


644
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,040
"Lovely song," but she was writing
about the lighting engineer
she was having an affair with.


645
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,360
This is true.
LAUGHTER


646
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,560
Are you starting to feel even
vaguely sorry for me?


647
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,320
It was unbelievably awkward
in the studio


648
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,360
because Lindsey would save the
vocals until all the recording


649
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,080
was done because he knew Dan well.


650
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,760
If he starts singing all the lines
you're talking about


651
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,200
with Stevie standing there,
she'd walk out.


652
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,120
But the worst thing is...
Quite clever.


653
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,040
It is, for getting the album down,


654
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,720
but then if you have to take it on
tour, poor old Stevie, all of them,


655
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,160
have to perform these songs about,


656
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,000
"I've got a small penis
and I'm better off..." Yes.


657
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,200
Because I'm just thinking,


658
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,040
if we ever put a band together
on Top Gear, I could write a song


659
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,360
called I Am A Crashing Bore and
then get James May to perform it.


660
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,560
Awww.


661
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,880
Then James could write one,
I'm An Irritating Little Brummie,


662
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,280
and for 40 years
Hammond would have to go along,


663
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,520
"I really don't like doing this."
Because that's what Rumours is.


664
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,560
No doubt.


665
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,560
That experience in the studio
was so horrendous, emotionally,


666
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,360
and the music was great and we all
aspired to... We didn't ever think


667
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,600
of walking out because we were
so into what we were doing.


668
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,760
Became the glue that
if we got through that,


669
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,720
we can get through 12 years
of high, high-powered,


670
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,920
which is probably 12-15 years,
we didn't stop doing anything.


671
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,080
Literally on the road,
in the studio...


672
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,560
Cos you are still all together.
We are, yeah. We must get onto cars.


673
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,160
We must get onto cars. Ah.


674
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,240
You live on the Pacific island
of Maui. I do. Yeah. OK.


675
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,960
You are a rock god,
an incredibly successful musician.


676
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,520
And you drive a...


677
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,920
My most cherished car
is an Austin 7.


678
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,600
And we... This is... We're not...


679
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,040
This is a picture of you with it
that we have here. Oh, yeah.


680
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,000
How did you come by that?


681
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,120
Many, many, many years ago,
I probably was like 19.


682
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,240
A friend of mine had a flat
in Earls Court.


683
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,440
I get off the tube and there was
this little car,


684
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,440
I kept walking by it,
month after month after month,


685
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,360
and I fell in love with the car.


686
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,920
And one time I left a note
on the car, said,


687
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,560
"If ever you fancy selling this,


688
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,920
"I would love to give
this car a home."


689
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,600
And then about 18 months later
we happened to be starting
to do fairly well.


690
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,280
My mum, which was
the phone number I had left,


691
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,960
got a phone call from
the guy, who said,


692
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,760
"I'm moving and I want a home
for my little car." And I bought it.


693
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,400
And you've still got it now? Yeah.


694
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,000
But I presume that all the way
through these late '70s


695
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,720
and '80s, obviously, you were
in a limo, so where was that?


696
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,680
Well, that was part of those years


697
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,000
when you're not quite sure
what happened.


698
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,240
LAUGHTER


699
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,080
And I went with the band
to the United States,


700
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,000
which was probably 15 or 16 years.


701
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,920
Eric Clapton was
then my brother-in-law.


702
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:24,800
I said, would you look after - it
was called Lettuce Leaf. The car was?


703
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,960
By my children, it was Lettuce Leaf,
so it was always Lettuce Leaf.


704
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,280
He said, sure, we'll put
it in the barn, and that was it.


705
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,440
And years later, I got a call
from Eric's manager saying,


706
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,840
"Can we get rid of it?"


707
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,880
And I didn't realise it had
been in his orchard for 15 years


708
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,200
and was full of birds' nests,
had been out in the open.


709
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,720
It survived and they had it rebuilt,


710
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,800
and the next time I saw it
was in Maui, where I live,


711
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,880
and us car people, stupid sloppy
dates that we tend to be,


712
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,760
I sort of broke down
when I met her at the dock.


713
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,840
She was just there,


714
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,360
in Maui, and I went,
"How cool is that?" I love all that.


715
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,680
That's exactly what cars are.
To me, how fast they go


716
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,960
is sort of not relevant,
it's how you... Absolutely.


717
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,760
I got married to my first wife in
that car, and that was my only car.


718
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,560
Now, presumably, you can't drive
Lettuce Leaf all the time,


719
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:25,800
so what...? I have a 2004 twin turbo
Porsche that I like a lot.


720
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,440
And I had it all tarted up.
That's my main car.


721
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,120
Can you get it going in Maui?


722
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,200
It's only an island,
so there's only three roads, really.


723
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,880
But there is one that goes right
through sugarcane fields


724
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,040
and you can get up to about 130,
140 miles an hour in certain places,


725
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,240
which I confess that I do.
You just have, actually.


726
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,320
LAUGHTER


727
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,160
You just did do that.
And that's in the Porsche.


728
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,760
Have you actually ever done
any racing?


729
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,320
Only in the old days,
the wicked '80s and early '90s.


730
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,240
Anybody and everybody was doing it.


731
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,840
It was an excuse for another
party or something,


732
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,280
and we were all... Half of us
were stoned, most of the time.


733
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,320
LAUGHTER


734
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,720
So what was it like out there today?


735
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
Better than last week,
when it was snowing.


736
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,680
Well, I wasn't stoned,
so that's good.


737
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,600
Who would like to see Mick's lap?


738
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,080
AUDIENCE: Yeah!


739
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,280
Come on, mate. Oh, Lord.
Let's have a look. Oh, God.


740
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,480
Right. Now, you're a drummer,


741
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,960
and I always associate drummers
with being coordinated.


742
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,760
Don't stop, come on, come on.


743
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,520
Remember the damn song,
you played it for 40 years.


744
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,720
.."Thinking about tomorrow"!
First corner.


745
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,640
But you think drummers are going
to be able to get their hands


746
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,240
and their feet... This was not me,
right? Yep, it sure is. Into the mud.


747
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,000
That's pretty tidy.
Come on, don't pussyfoot it.


748
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,800
You don't want to go
too fast through there,


749
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,000
you'll just spin wide.
That looks quite tidy as well.


750
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,520
Glad I had those brown underpants on,
I can tell you that much.


751
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,840
LAUGHTER


752
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,360
What a beautiful looking day
out there it is today.


753
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:14,240
It's going to go wrong any second,
right? No, look at that! Bang on.


754
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,480
And up now towards
the follow-through.


755
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:25,040
Full power. Full power, yes, yes,
yes, yes. Power it. Power!


756
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,040
Come on!


757
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:34,680
Cut it, cut it. Yes. This is the
tricky one. And that is nicely cut.


758
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,720
And into Gambon...


759
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,640
And no big dramas there,
and across the line!


760
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,040
APPLAUSE


761
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,760
Now, that looked tidy.
But was it fast?


762
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,720
Whereabouts do you think you've
come? Oh, I dread to think. No idea?


763
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,360
I hope I'm not in the last 10.
You're not.


764
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:07,200
Because, Mick Fleetwood,
you did it in 1...


765
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:13,920
..45.4. And that...


766
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,520
APPLAUSE


767
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,080
..puts you...


768
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,920
..between a wizard
and bassist in Blur.


769
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,760
Now, wait a minute. I always try
to look for some good news there.


770
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,320
How old are you?
If that's not... I'm 65. Yeah, 65.


771
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,200
So, you are, without any question
or shadow of doubt,


772
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,760
the fastest pensioner
we've ever had.


773
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,520
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING


774
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,920
I've been looking forward to you
coming down ever since


775
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,600
we knew this series was coming back,


776
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,720
and it's just for me been
an enormous pleasure.


777
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,040
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mick Fleetwood!


778
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,280
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING


779
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,240
Tonight we're driving across America
in three GT cars - the Lexus LFA,


780
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,840
the Aston Martin Vanquish,
and the SRT Viper.


781
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,720
So far, we have established
that none of them


782
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,960
is a match for a
GP modified Mitsubishi


783
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,320
and that all three have been
beaten by fighter planes.


784
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,360
So, nothing of any practical
value whatsoever.


785
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,360
But maybe that will
change in Los Angeles.


786
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,480
'For a genuine, real-world test,
Hammond decided


787
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,720
'we should head for one of the
city's famous storm drains.'


788
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,000
Tell you what,


789
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,040
I bet I can leave longer elevenses
in this then you can in yours.


790
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,320
What, you mean black marks
on the road from wheel spinning?


791
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,720
Yes, wheel spinning starts,
leave elevenses.


792
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,040
I can do a longer elevenses than you.
No, you can't.


793
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,320
I'll be the adjudicator.
You can be the adjudicator


794
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,000
because I'm going to demonstrate
something to you now.


795
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,480
Three, two, one and go.


796
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,520
I'd say that was a dead heat. Yeah.


797
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,480
'So, Hammond suggested we should see
who could do the best doughnuts.'


798
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,600
Skid!


799
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,200
Doing a big skid now.


800
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,640
'Many Hollywood scenes have been
filmed here over the years,


801
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,080
'but none has ever looked or
sounded quite as bovine as this.


802
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,120
'And none has ever caused
quite so much damage.'


803
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,360
Suggestions? I mean, running away,
obviously. That's where I was going.


804
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:05,600
Running away, really. How far should
we run away? Quite a long way.


805
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,600
And how soon? Now.


806
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,480
I can't get my seatbelt on.


807
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,240
Get in!


808
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,480
Running.


809
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,520
Running away.


810
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,520
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.


811
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,680
'Lexus, this is Sonia,
where would you like to go today?'


812
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:39,040
Yes, hello, I've accidentally
painted a gentleman's sausage


813
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,680
on a storm drain.


814
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,840
Oh, my. I need to run away.


815
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,680
'The lovely lady suggested Palm
Springs, which was 110 miles away.


816
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,200
'So we settled down and thought
a little bit about our cars.'


817
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,960
Let's have a quick recap.


818
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,120
This Aston has
the most charismatic engine,


819
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,200
it's the most tasteful
and it was the least shot.


820
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,680
Ask yourself, honestly,
from watching this programme,


821
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,560
which of these cars you take if
you were to drive across America,


822
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,400
across Europe, across Siberia.


823
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,240
It doesn't matter. It's this one.


824
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,800
I said at the beginning
of this trip that I had a feeling


825
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,320
I might fall for the Viper, and
I have. It's won me over completely.


826
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,760
It doesn't have the aluminium accents
inside of the Aston,


827
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,360
or the computers of the Lexus,


828
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,240
but it's done everything
we've asked of it on this journey,


829
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:45,080
and it's done everything with its own
particular style, its own attitude.


830
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,120
And let's not forget, at a fraction
of the price of the other two,


831
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,040
this is the plucky underdog here.


832
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,680
If somebody were to offer me
a choice of any car that had


833
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,920
ever been made, ever,
I would take a dark blue LFA.


834
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,120
That's how much I love this thing.
I mean, yes, there are faults.


835
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:09,080
The petrol tank is too small, the
seatbelt is idiotic, and, joking


836
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:14,080
aside, I would like a cup holder,
but the rest of it is so exquisite.


837
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,920
I'm going to say it.
It's the best car I've ever driven.


838
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,440
It really is.


839
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,320
'With all that sorted out,


840
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,200
'we opened the taps
and headed into Palm Springs.'


841
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,000
Men bouncing a ball like
a netball. Like small girls.


842
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,280
The man is going to catch the ball
and then throw it.


843
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,080
And they score so many goals,
nobody reacts when they get a goal.


844
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,680
Because it happens every 35 seconds.


845
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,080
You can't really tackle someone,
can you?


846
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,880
Erm... Can they not take
the ball...? Gentlemen, gentlemen.


847
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,400
JEREMY CLEARS THROAT


848
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,800
Haven't we finished?


849
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,200
"We think you should run away more.


850
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,000
"Tomorrow morning,
at precisely 8 o'clock,


851
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,840
"you will race to the border."


852
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,320
What border?


853
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,760
You're not going to like this.


854
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,360
"The last to arrive
will cross into Mexico...


855
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,480
"..and spend a few days road testing
the Mastretta sports car


856
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,720
"for a forthcoming
item on the show."


857
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:47,600
The Mastretta is the one that
started a bit of trouble for us.


858
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,080
When we spoke about it
on the news on the show,


859
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,760
the Mexicans took an exception
to some of the things we said.


860
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:57,120
They hate us in Mexico. Don't want
to go to Mexico. No, they hate us.


861
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,680
'We told Hammond
we'd get an early night.


862
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,680
'But we didn't.'


863
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,480
Right, James and I have had
a bit of a discussion,


864
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,520
and we've decided that since
it was Hammond that caused all


865
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,720
the problems,
Hammond should lose this.


866
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,360
So what have you got in mind, James?


867
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,920
Well, what I've got in mind, Jeremy,


868
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,600
or rather in my pocket,
is a couple of bananas.


869
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,440
Because I've seen this in a film,


870
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,480
I thought we could put
a banana in the tailpipe.


871
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,400
A banana in the tailpipe.
Let's do it.


872
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,080
What this does is prevent
the car from exhausting


873
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:30,000
and the back pressure builds up
in the engine, and then it stops.


874
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,720
'Annoyingly,
the Viper's exhaust was so big


875
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,280
'we had to substitute the bananas
with a selection of other fruits.


876
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,960
'And then Clarkson
had another idea.'


877
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,040
If we pop his seat
all the way back, yes?


878
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,640
It also has electric pedals,
this thing, yes?


879
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,080
So if we make the pedals go
all the way forwards,


880
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:54,400
the seat all the way back,
and then take the fuse out... Yes!


881
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,000
'Having stolen the fuses
for the seat and the pedals,


882
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,800
'we then disconnected two
of the V10's HT leads.'


883
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,160
He's got a V8 motor,
he's got... No pedal movement.


884
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,680
No pedal movement,
seat's fully back. That'll do.


885
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,760
'At precisely 8:07 the following
morning, the race began.'


886
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,360
Get back! Get back!


887
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,080
The Lexus. The Viper!
The Lexus, the Lexus. It's there!


888
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,600
That's mine, that's mine.


889
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,920
Oh, funny! I can't...
What are you...?


890
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,640
Oh, no!


891
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,680
Oh, this seatbelt is going
to be the death of me.


892
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,560
Oh, nice(!) Thank you! Nice.


893
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,920
Just for the record, and in case
this goes terribly wrong,


894
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,400
I said I didn't like Mexican food,
and what I meant was,


895
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,760
I don't like refried beans
and cheese.


896
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,680
That's all.
It's all Hammond's fault.


897
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,240
Funny, funny, also funny.
Thank you(!)


898
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,440
Right, we live in a cartoon,
really(!)


899
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,240
ENGINE GROWLS


900
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,280
That's not right.


901
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,240
The problem is that
Richard Hammond may be stupid


902
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,640
and a rampant racist,
but he is quite practical.


903
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,320
He'll have that car put back
together again in about five


904
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,160
minutes - it would take me a year.


905
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,320
Ah! It's an HT lead off.


906
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,080
One...two.


907
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,160
Right. I will kill them.


908
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,200
I'm going to kill them.


909
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,240
If the Mexicans don't, I shall.


910
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,280
'As Hammond began
his hate-fuelled charge,


911
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:48,200
'Jeremy and I were bogged down
in downtown Palm Springs.'


912
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:53,520
So, we've got a retirement
community, the rozzers up ahead,


913
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,040
there's nothing I can do.
40 miles an hour.


914
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,880
I lost, I don't know, 10 minutes.
Maybe more.


915
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,320
Jeremy's got to stop for fuel.


916
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,960
He'll never get that done
in under five minutes.


917
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,200
I have to hope James
gets lost or dawdles.


918
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,160
What's really unfair
about this race is that


919
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:22,520
I wasn't particularly rude about
Mexicans, I just made a small joke


920
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,480
about the Mexican ambassador
in London.


921
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,880
And I've been to see him,
I've apologised,


922
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:32,560
drunk quite a lot of his tequila,
and all is well.


923
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,520
But the Mexicans don't know that.


924
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,040
'Once clear of Palm Springs,
we faced a choice.


925
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,200
'Take the road to the east
of the Salton Sea, which was longer


926
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,000
'but should be quiet, or go on the
freeway and pray it wasn't too busy.


927
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,200
'I went for the freeway.'


928
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,120
Take me to victory, Aston Martin.


929
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,920
'Whilst, stupidly,
Jeremy went for the longer route.'


930
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:07,280
106 miles to the border
and my range is...


931
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,880
..104.


932
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,560
Ohhhh.


933
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,600
So now I've got a choice.


934
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:22,760
Do I drive slowly and increase the
range, or drive fast and fill up?


935
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,080
That one.


936
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,160
I'm having him.


937
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,280
Jeremy can't be going this fast
on that mountain road, surely.


938
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,400
'Sorry, James, it wasn't a mountain
road, which meant that once


939
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:46,960
'more, thanks to editing trickery,
I could get up to 55 miles an hour.'


940
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,360
I'm in an American road movie now.


941
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,880
'Feeling pleased with my choice
of route, I called Mr Angry.'


942
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,480
RINGING TONE


943
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,160
Hammond. You utter,
utter bastard. Where are you?


944
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:10,200
I'm on the east side, on the most
amazing road I've ever found.


945
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,320
Oh, God. Have you seen James?


946
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,760
No, I'm on the other road,
the other side of the water.


947
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,440
So he should be ahead of me


948
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,880
if he's gone this way, or... James
is on your side of the lake.


949
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,600
So he must be on this road then.
Right, I'm going to reel him in.


950
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,800
In fact, at this point,
we all had the hammer down.


951
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,080
HE CHUCKLES


952
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:51,840
51 miles to go. 30 miles of range.


953
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:58,440
Come on, Aston. Where the hell
is Hammond? Is he catching me?


954
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:04,200
Right, 60 miles.
And no sign of James.


955
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,480
I'm just praying to see
a speck of blue up ahead.


956
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,360
I've got to be in front of Jeremy,
there's no way he can do it.


957
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,000
He's got to stop for fuel.


958
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,040
# Stand by your man... #


959
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,280
I don't know what that is,
but that's all it's having.


960
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,120
'To find out what damage the fuel
stop had done, I called May.'


961
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,560
Clarkson. May, where are you?


962
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,400
I have got to the bottom of the lake


963
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,800
and I'm just coming
into the small town...


964
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:40,120
Oh, no, I think you're ahead of me.
Has Hammond caught you up?


965
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:43,680
Hammond is behind me,
but only by a few miles.


966
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,640
Argh! That means he's probably
ahead of me.


967
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,680
'But the race wasn't done yet.


968
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:53,960
'Because at the bottom of the lake
there were three routes to


969
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,280
'the finish line in the border
town of Calexico.


970
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,640
'And none of us had any idea
which would be the fastest.'


971
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,800
Jeremy will go on the 111.
He has to,


972
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:09,240
because he's come from that side,
he will get to that one first.


973
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:14,840
I get to the 86 first, but is it
quicker? I just don't know. Oh, God.


974
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,800
What would Hammond do?


975
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:24,240
Right, this road takes me straight
through Calexico to the border.


976
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,240
I think this is the quickest.


977
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,920
I think James has gone
a different route,


978
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,720
this is where I'm going to take him.


979
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,640
Please, God, don't let me be last.


980
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,600
A big drive-through dentist there,
hopefully Hammond will stop at that.


981
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,240
Four miles, come on, come on,
come on, come on.


982
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:54,480
Coming into town now. This
all looks decidedly Mexican now.


983
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,320
Which is to say brilliant, very nice.


984
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,320
Oh, God.


985
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,920
Traffic lights.


986
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,440
Oh, God, and the rozzers
are behind me.


987
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,840
Fifth Street, yes.
Does it go to Mexico?


988
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,080
Where is the border crossing?


989
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,240
Can't get lost right now.
Mess it all up at the end.


990
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,360
Border, border, border.


991
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,480
HE CACKLES


992
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,040
You beauty!


993
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,200
May or Hammond,
which one is going to be eaten?


994
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:51,160
'The answer came seconds later.'


995
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,640
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!


996
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,280
I don't care if you won -
is it just you here? Yep.


997
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,320
Ho-ho!


998
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,640
Oh, God, no. No.


999
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,200
Buenos dias!


1000
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,440
Is that Mexico there?
That's the border there.


1001
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,520
Look, it's very simple.
Goodbye. Bye, thank you so much.


1002
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,080
You're in the United States
of America, land of the free.


1003
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,160
There's a big fence, the other
side of it, everybody hates you.


1004
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,960
Bye! Bye.


1005
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,200
It's a bit like sending Paddington
Bear into a mincing machine,


1006
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:38,160
there is an element of...
He looks quite tragic.


1007
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,080
With that, back to the studio.


1008
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,920
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING


1009
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,080
I think we can probably handle
a conclusion on our own.


1010
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:51,760
Because the Aston Martin
and the Lexus were... Tremendous.


1011
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,240
They really were, weren't they?


1012
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,720
And the Viper was... Awful.
Awful, absolutely.


1013
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,280
So there we are.


1014
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,600
Now, we will be bringing you
a review of the Mexican Mastretta


1015
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:05,160
sports car in a couple of weeks,
unless of course in the meantime


1016
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,000
somebody finds a suspiciously white
tooth in their taco.


1017
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,360
LAUGHTER


1018
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,280
In which case, we will be showing
you a touching tribute to


1019
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,040
the late broadcaster
Richard Hammond.


1020
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:19,760
So, on that potential bombshell,
it's now time to end.


1021
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,880
Thank you so much for watching,
good night.
